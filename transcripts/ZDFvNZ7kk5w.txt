gives you the inside presence on both ends of of the rim especially shot protection rori and Hastings battling for the tip it finds Dion Brown and a transition bucket to get the Eagles started and its one of the things that theyre looking for Dion Brown to get started one of the things I think that if you can get the ball to go early for a guy thats been trying to find his offense good way to get it started SMU answers inside and tayori got fed on his way to the rack SMU led by Andy Enfield who spent some time in Boston he was an assistant for the Celtics in the late 90s under Rick patino obviously went from there to be an assistant under Leonard Hamilton at Florida State then to Florida GF Coast USC and now SMU and Earl Grant in year four at the Helm of the Eagles Ry Ori at the line the Boston College foul when against Applause Hastings one for two for Trey Ori and the rebound pulled down by Elijah strong strong strong was wide open passed up to three and then turns it over you see strong pass up that three hes a guy that can knock down that shot but I think that if you earlier in the game if you get those wide open attempts you got to go ahead and put it up and allow your defense an opportunity to get a rebound Deon Brown had a chance to attack Baseline there do you think its part of the fact that BC wants to not play super fast then he pulled it back out well I thought we talked with Earl greld that he talked about the fact that theyve got to have some offensive discipline you want to get down to your second and third looks and not res and resist throwing up early shots you getu batt for the rebound but it bounces away and finds Boston colleges Elijah strong Joshua Beetle the Clemson transfer Donald Han Jr talked about him in the open inside to Hastings the red shirt freshman draws the foul well if thats what Im talking about when you see where Boston College you got to your second and third looks and at last time you get Hastings down there realizing that is got to gather himself igot talo tries to stay up top but you got to stay vertical that last time committing that foul and thats one of the things again but BC you want to run your offense ran whats it like for a red shirt freshman who didnt play last year Hastings has played 11 games played 13 minutes of ball game now hes in the starting lineup for the very first time what are the emotions whats the energy like for that guy oh I think that you see him miss his first free throw is that youre youre excited you want to come out here and play Within self but I think for him is to keep the game simple you want to make sure that you set screens rebound any opportunity that you do get offensive rebounds and the ball get to get to your shots dont try to play out of your game gets the bounce on the second Hastings goes one for Applause two the clock was slow to start as poy took it up the floor so theyre going to take a few seconds off the clock here both the game clock and the shot clock stayed at 1845 for about five ticks officials today Bert Smith Brent Hampton and Mark schner and Matt cross wearing number 33 the Beverly Massachusetts native played at UMass the past couple of years SMU his third ACC school after playing his freshman year at Miami and his s more season for Chris Mack at Louisville acrobatic maneuver and Beetle draws the contact and if its yigu its number two and a technical foul against the SMU bench assessed by Brent Hampton and I think for Boston College you want to be able to get the stop on in get in that early transition you see Beetle realizing that he can get cross on his backside comes in otalu goes up what looks to be his second foul and for Boston College any chance you can you want to try to get some easy buckets and not allow SMU to accept their defense not sure which assistant got the tech but it certainly wasnt Enfield who was down near at the end of the bench and Hampton the official clearly pointed to the the staff seated so Donald Han Jr gets a chance to watch the ball go through the basket although he can only do it once two fouls on yigu he goes to the bench jell Colbert brings pretty good size Off the Bench 61 play for Kansas State Squad that went to the N last year and now Beetle fouled by yigu going to the line the Free Throw Contest here in the first 95 seconds BR well and again we talked about the fact that with with Boston College youre not going to win this game with the pace obviously you dont want to slow it down but you want to slow M SMU down limit them to one possession and if you can run get out and then again you want to make this your pace of game Ro Grant was not happy with a free throw disparity in BCs ACC opener at Wake Forest six free throw attempts in the opening couple of minutes for the Eagles and a loose ball that does trickle across the in line itll stay with SMU and you watch with SMU right there you see Sloppy pass right there Edwards tries to get it over and then for Boston College you want to muck this game up you want to force SMU out of their normal sets but then for SMU youve got to take your time get downhill youve got an advantage for being able to probe that lane touch the lane and get it inside cber turns it over that was a bad Kick Out Pass Applause someone needs to wake up the Mustangs well and thats one of the things also when you think about for SMU you come in its a noon game 11 am 1100 am Dallas time and theyve been here since Thursday how long does it take them to wake up and get your your your engine running finish exams on Wednesday they traveled up to Massachusetts on Thursday before all the snow came through on the Block Elijah strong cant connect and a good rebound by cross coming off a 16 rebound game against LSU playing in front of a lot of friends and family back in the Bay State Matt cross pops and connects and thats one of the things that weve seen with Matt cross over the years is not only his ability to knock down the three but you see can get the ball get down to other end it put a lot of pressure on the defense good start for him I still remember Jim L Anda saying but Matt cross is a freshman all the older guys on the team like him because every time they pass him the ball he makes the shot eagles with an ugly pass their second turnover and cross does a good job of realizing that hey I can go ahead and get the ball inside poopy Miller penetrates gets it over to him allows him to be a to get those feet set that was actually the Eagles third early turnover and cross with a strong take to the bucket and we talked about the fact that Matt CW has got a few fans in the stand comes out right now being aggressive gets that three puts his head down and puts his body right into the chest of Deion Brown five straight for cross Dion Brown answers at the other end and thats a good sign for Dion Brown again we talked ear Grant he talked about he thought that sooner or later hes going to have a Breakout game but the fact that hes come out looking for and hunting his offense thr take but unable to finish with tayori be leaves it for brown nice pass inside and the easy two for Chad venning into the game for the first time makes an impact Applause immediately five straight for the Eagles after crosses five spurt lopy Miller the former demon Deacon to cross into the lane carves out some space and a tough finish inside cross is coming out I love the fact hes hunting his offense being aggressive realizing that he can play play a little bully ball gets to his spot and gather himself he has gotten a lot stronger since he was a freshman at Miami four years ago venning left open offensive rebound by hand Chad venning that was only his fourth threepoint attempt of the Season he hasnt made one yet Donald H will try and he connects from the right wing and the play was set up by by Josh by Josh B Beetle get him to the Lane realizing he can get there for to help and you get donalan a wide open three five different Eagles have scored in the opening five minutes PJ Edwards going glass thats one of the things about Edwards games too I like the fact that he can knock down to three but does not resist realize that he can get to the basket no Rim protection at the time game is starting to pick up a little bit Eagles get it to the big man venning St Pon Aventure transfer its a tough load on the Block comes up short though well defended by cber and poopy a blur into the four Court creates contact out the basket poopy Miller chance for a threepoint play after our first timeout if it may be cold outside and snowy but we got both teams starting to warm it up a little bit my man Dion Brown said you know what meet me at at The Rim we got a good one BC up early by Music two Massachusetts native what also matters when you got people in the stands you want to show up and show out and I love the fact again Matt crws has comeing in and its mixed it up being physical get into the basket knock down to three this is the guy again when you look at the fact that the reigning ACC player of the week he has changed an awful lot and when we talked with Andy anfield he said that he has been the guy thats taken his game to the next level especially this five game winning streak hes fifth in the league in rebounds per game now averaging 8 and a half certainly playing well the past few weeks he was hampered by the back injury that he suffered in the first minute of the first game of the season came back wasnt the same player in the Butler game bopy Miller by the way looking to complete the threepoint play he comes up short Mustangs one for three at the line here early foul one against Dion Brown his first and just a bit of house keeping the technical was called on SMU assistant Chris Capco for saying a word or to in something that Brent Hampton was not on board Applause with Roger McFarland in the game for the first time Dion Brown to the basket wont roll over the iron but he will get to the line Dion Brown the transfer from UNBC where he averaged about 19 points a game last year for the retrievers that a slow start to the season hampered by a couple different injuries but a guy that the Eagles have high expectations for and as you said a guy that could go off here today well I thought when we talk with Earl Grant he talked about this is the guy that he thought could have a breakout and youve seen him I love the fact that hes been aggressive trying to look for a shot doing a good job of being under control and getting to the Lane and putting a lot of pressure on the defense thats what you want to do against SMU is you want to force them to defend one for two for brown mention this is the second ever meeting Boston College and SMU played once before but not in this country they played in Tokyo in 1986 your Georgia Tech Alo jackets were over there as well that Tokyo weekend in the mid 80s and actually I was on that team then were you really yeah I was you got to talk about that didnt realize that coming up next the second game of our CW Courtside Saturday double header its Louisville and Florida State down from the Tucker Center in Tallahassee Cardinals and seminal with Tom wormy and former UNCC standout John Henson on the call looking forward to that one what do you remember about being in Tokyo with BC and SMU in 1986 Brian Oliver well it was my freshman year and I I remember going over and that was my my first time being abro and to be honest with you it was my first time actually going through the process of having a passport and then trying to get acclimated to the time difference as a young athlete um we obviously had a great opportunity to play over there against some quality teams and I do remember as you mentioned it playing against SMU during that time ch Kelly enters the game hes hot already and Kellys another one of those guys is the spark of offense hes going to be have to contain poopy Miller because again hes going to put a lot of pressure on hims got to try to stay in front you see offensive foul called against Applause Music cross Chaz Kelly coming off his first double figure scoring game of the season picks up where he left off against Stonehill and I think that for Earl Grant having a mixture of guys that give you a bucket thats one of the things that he said that hes most PR proud of is the fact that hes got interchangeable parts the guys that you can rotate in and out but again for today Kellys ability to be able to give them some instant offense is going to be a need Kelly connects with Hastings off balance no foul offensive rebound and a chance for a threepoint play Elijah strong tough in the interior and pardon the P pardon the pun but Elijah strong strong down there this is one of those guys that you know is that hes going to play with a lot of emotion realiz hes got a small little boopy Miller Downs there gra gathers himself and then absorbs that contact and talking about a team that needs that emotion right there you see flexes on them this Boston College team understands that theyve got to muck this game up and make it really physical five personal fouls called against muu in the first seven minutes of the game including the T theyre at six team fouls with a lot of time to go and heres the thing Evan for SMU you understand that Boston College is going to try to play really physical you stay disciplined with your offense run your sets touch that paint because when any time you try to put your head down and get to the paint youve been successful battle and a jump ball called trayor was tied up by McFarland that last time on the penetration for Harris a lot of times you want to make sure that you give your guys in trayor an opportunity to keep that ball high anytime bigs pull it down youre going to see those pesky guards down there trying to get their hands on the ball cross pulls it back out shot clock down to five Harris with three Harris along two rebound deflected and controlled by BCs Donald junor good block out inside there by a couple different Eagles off balance wont fall for hand here comes poopy Miller driving kick tayori the trailer with a left hand a nice move by tayori basically realize that he can do a little bit of a Euro Step get the ball right in there I love him getting downhill probably met him at The Rim a little late tayori averaged almost 15 a game last year for the gaos at UC Santa barara Thats back door feed unable to finish though hand on the reverse could not convert poopy backing in to Kelly lost it fourth turnover for SMU Kelly and he went down and the foul is called now the officials will confer and they are going to change the call to a travel Earl Grant says okay but hes not thrilled about it Eagles by six 2158 and 1 half minutes gone opening half these two teams enter with a combined record of 16 six the Mustangs 9 and2 with some really good wins early in Andy enfields first season we talked about the fact that at 9 and two theyve won five theyre five five in a row yeah but I think in todays game Boston College has done a good job of being able to control the P the pace but I think that for SMU theyve got to get better opportunities to score they got to try to get in transition no good for Harris at end Jaden Hastings got his first start today McFarland Miss fires and a good rebound Inside by Ambrose Hilton this is Ambrose Hilton at the other end misses from close range Eagles havent scored in about two and a half minutes now Boston College team I think its fair to say theyre streaky offensively but its not is this team thats not going to knock down a ton of Threes but they want to do a good a good job of being able to Pro be physical and you see right there it looks to be a travel on hand y but so far so far in the first half theyve done a good job of being able to get to their second and third options and have more discipline when I look at this score right now obviously for SMU you want to pick up the pace a little bit more and The Bigs have to finish at The Rim when you get the ball dumped off by those guards DJ Edwards rejected by Chaz Kelly loose ball though finds Ambrose Hilton he misses another layup theyre going to count the basket though I think Hastings was over there on the go 10 ball was still on the rim the balls any part of the balls inside the cylinder watch Hastings right there to its a good call CR at the two for Keon Ambrose Hilton close captioning for CW Courtside Saturday is brought to you by Sketchers basketball comfort that performs Keon Ambrose Hilton the senior from Toronto transfer from Alabama Brian is it disorienting for you when almost every guy on the team is a transfer like cuz in your era it wasnt like that no I I think that the teams that you see Edwards go in and with a good finish kind of lost it on the way up he did got it in anyway but I think the teams that you see like an SMU that are able to have a good balance of bringing in the right guys sometimes you bring in the most talented and its hard with the chemistry but I think that you see the teams that had the success are the ones that can get the right type of guys and then they can jail quicker as youve seen them do right nowor rips down the rebound Eagles scoring drought nearing four minutes now SMU with a chance to Tyre Take the Lead popcorns up in the air controlled this is Harris for the lead SMU in front for the first time today and Nice Shot by Harrison again you see the SMU start to get a little bit of their offense to go one time you saw Boston College go on their run as of late theyre a little stagnant on their offense four turnovers in the last four minutes for BC and missed their four shots theyve gotten as well pop long two gets his own rebound Donald H Jr on the second chance delivers and nice move by Donald Han again to be able to cut that drought for Boston College but again you see little post action for from Harris down there they got Beetle for the foul you see again we talked about you know this SMU team they got a lot of shot makers that last time Harris being straight right there gets an opportunity to set his feet knock down the three hes more of a combo guard that can give it to you inside out hes not the shooter you want to leave though about 46 from the perimeter so far this season and thats one of the things for Boston College you got to have recognition understand who to guard and who not Applause to Harris ties it youre watching CW Courtside Saturday presented by All State youre in good hands Harris one of the three captains of of this SMU team along with boy Miller and Keon Ambrose Hilton Luca Taves checks in for VC speaking of Tokyo LCA grew up in Tokyo cousin of Jonathan Taves former NHL star Taves playing his ninth game of the season get some early action and the Eagles struggling to find their Rhythm after they got after a pretty good start in this game Brock and that last pick and a row if youre Hasting you got to slow down just a little bit I feel like his motor is running a little too fast but for Bigs you want to make sure you catch that ball Hastings that last time tried to grow the ball one hand and for Boston College You got to execute on these possessions you canot have empty possessions thats going to allow SMU to be able to get into their offense 112 is the SMU run since the Eagles led by eight trayor kicks it back out Edwards back for tayori nice timing on the cut but a pass that would not connect and the Mustangs turn it over for the fifth time good first half going here at Chestnut Hill is in high gear its the Snoop Dog Arizona Bowl Pres presented by Jin and Juice Ohio Miami of Ohio and Colorado State thats Saturday 400 pm Eastern 1 pm Pacific only on the CW Ive been told Snoop will be there have you did you ever think that you would be advertising the Snoop Bowl its been a lifelong dream that I just fulfilled and sponsored by Jen and Juice Snoop was the star of the Paris Olympics this summer so it makes sense that he has a bowl game Chad venning and one and Vinnies one of those guys again we talked about that did not start the game but thats an opportunity for Boston College to take advantage you give him the ball down and then SMU allows the him to go ahead and go to work gets that contact shoots it over his left shoulder it may be something to keep your eyes on venning originally from Brooklyn double figure scorer each of the past two years for St Bonaventure he began his college career in Baltimore at Morgan State feel like everybody has their own unique Odyssey toward the end of their college basketball career in 2024 see to come back into the game s with those early fouls and then also Matt cross I thought Matt cross came in foru got going see if they can get those two guys involved in the game yigao only played a minute or so before he picked up his second foul but youre right about cross Brian he really you know theres one thing about being aggressive but he he he changed the mentality of his teams purpose at the offensive end with some of his actions early because again hes able to get to a spot and hes strong you see the penetration for the an one there BJ Edwards counter and this SMU team we talked about her earlier EV is that theyve got guys that you can give the ball you space out to defense because they can go get a bucket you see that last time Edwards go in and then basically absorbs that contact good finish at the rim and what looked out to be Boston College having momentum slowly youve seen the momentum shift over for SMU tough match up for Luca Taves trying to slow down BJ Edwards on the dribble yeah and again points in the paint have started to pick up again we know that this SMU team is a high octane team for Boston College I still feel like you have an advantage try to space them out get to your second and third options and put pressure on them at The Rim five lead changes these past few minutes round comes up empty venning keeps it alive but the rebound pulled in by Applause yidu Edwards kicks it for cross not a bad close out by strong but cross buries it anyway but the play was set up by the penetration of Edwards you forced the Boston College defense to converge and then he has good presence to understand you got Matt cross hovering around that threepoint line kicks it out knocks it down three mat cross and double figures for the fifth time this season hes heating up you can feel it strong too strong gets it back with the other hand it goes and heres the thing is that a lot of times if you get that offensive rebound youre so strong realizing didnt have anything and then UL would already was already off of him goes right back at him going to get Donald Han Jr for the hip check foul and weve talked about the the impact that M cross has have watch this penetration by Edwards forces the defense to come out strong gets caught helping and at any time that you allow Matt cross to set his feet then he basically hope that he misses but cross has had a really productive first half he shot 40 from three as a freshman in just the 14 games he played at Miami journeyman career has brought him to SMU brief appearance for yigao hes back on the bench Applause he slowly started to creep up a little bit more in smus favor again I thought earlier in the first part of this half it benefited Boston College and again if Im Boston College continue try to pound that ball inside you got an ADV advantage thats not pounding it inside but the offensive rebound for Dion Brown surrounded by blue shirts he kicks it out for Tav Music Applause who touched it last SM you did its BC ball with five in the shot clock you saw dim Brown penetrating the hands and this is one of the things you talk about this SMU theyre active they get a lot ton of defections watch the fact he gets in there and you see Edwards on that back side this is what they want to do they want to cral you in get active hands and get out in transition Beetle throws it into venning clock winding down strong tough long three and they really didnt find the rim I would have liked to see strong that last time try to put his shoulder in the cross hes got an advantage as far as height and weight try to push his push the man down and try to get something closer to the rim SMU has made its last five field goals at this end of the floor cross passes up to three oh he gets the oh man and I really thought that cross passed up a wide open three thats one of those instances where you pass up a good shot for a better shot weve been talking about Matt cross this first half watch right here gets an opportunity where he freezes him and then decides to do that contact and has an acrobatic finish and gets a lucky roll M cross luck had nothing to do with it come on having a great first half a very different story than the first time he came to Connie for as a Miami freshman I was here for that game alongside Mike jinsky and cross struggled he started for the canes that night it was an empty Connie for him during the the heart of Co so this is the first time that hes playing in front of a crowd at PC he was recruited by BC coming out of high school but obviously found his way down to Florida loose ball near midcourt and its going to be a 10 second and again we talked the fact that this game has been amount of runs as of late SMU on a 22 to7 run this game has shifted in their favor starting to turn Boston College over theyre getting a little bit more of what they want and right now with less than five minutes to go already 35 points and thats one of the things again that plays in their favor Earl Grant was asking if they had gotten the cross half for it but no the the dribbler had one footed on each side of the line turnovers becoming a problem though for BC thats nine just over 15 minutes theyve been an issue lately cross has the size mismatch nice no look pass tip Wont Go frost strong hands inside brings it back out boopy Miller three MSM excuse me SMU putting their will on this game you see on this run forcing Boston College to call a timeout has extended this lead up until 10 largest lead for the Mustangs they trailed by eight at 2113 they out scored BC 257 ever Music since and if you look at both of teams 18 to 12 points in the paint in favor of SMU yeah the the ponies got it started in the paint theyre also four for four from three Matt cross knocking down a pair Chuck Harris mopy Miller each have a long ball as well and what was once an eightpoint lead for BC is now a 10point deficit for the Eagles and a really important four minutes here for BC to close out this half absolutely you see SMU into a what 131 best way to get to that is they get into the middle and then try to get those green Shooters out in the corner C Kelly its like he heard you and Dion Brown knocks down the three but its a great penetration you saw Kelly get in forc to help and he gets it over to Dion Brown we talked about Brown getting of this game give him that Firepower need to get him to keep going and try to cut into this lead to end off the first half nine first half points for Dion Brown and season high as 10 wide open inside derell Colbert throws it down corbert left wide open bopy Miller did a good job of being able to find him and again SMU has done a good job of being able to play a little bully ball get the smaller Boston College Defenders under the Applause Music rim back to Brown hes had a bit of a hot hand three for four up short there rebounded by cross third rebound to go with 133 first half points for the Beverly Massachusetts native mat cross boy Miller round and up rebounded by BCs Donald Han Jr and keeps it himself Coast to Coast nice move by hand he was able to turn mat cross around basically understood when he got that ball at the rebound he was going Coast to Coast thats one of the things I think that for Boston College get the stops get in early transition eight points four rebounds in the half for Donald Han Jr thats what theyre looking for from him cross absolutely overpowering hand inside and he says you are too little but Matt Crossman hes done a great job of balancing out his game and anytime he realizes hes got an advantage its just being physical with the smaller Boston College players Kelly lost his dribble kicks it out Donald H Junior right at Cross and he knocks down the three and Donald junr picking up his offense you see two consecutive buckets again for Boston College starting to pick up your offense timeout taken Crossing hand going back and forth at each other a little bit weve talked about Matt cross though and the fact that from the beginning of the game the level of aggression that he has with penetrating watch where he realizes hes got hand on his backside and just commit to going and basically say my man you are too small its a long two for Donald Han Jr so now hes in double figures with 10 and we take a look at what smus done so far theyre shooting 63 from the field game stats brought to you by Sketcher Footwear stylish comfort for men women and kids what a thing that stands out for me for Boston College is the fact that they started out well you know their field goal percentage is dip but for SMU youre shooting 63 and 22 points in a paint a lot of thats come from Matt cross being able to probe down there and taking advantage but then for Boston College the second chance points at 10 also is something to keep an eye out on Mustangs only had one point in the first two and A2 minutes of the game 41 ever since in a reminder we encourage you to stay tuned for todays halftime show presented by Subaru love its what makes Subaru Subaru oh this is getting spicy here between cross and hand cross gave him the two small then hand drain the jumper in his grill and its not over yet well and youve got two competitors you know Donald Han Junior we talked about hes one of those guys thats feisty one of the better rebounding guy uh guards in the league and then you see Matt cross from the beginning of the game hes come out and decide he was going to be the aggressor you got both guys jocking for Music position Harris over to Endo shot clock at five for boy Miller tough shot inside its cross on the glass again hes really tough and strong in there coming up on the Subaru halftime show will preview the Cardinal seminal 2 pm tip from Tallahassee once again thats a halftime show presented by Subaru love its what makes Subaru Subaru I think one of the things for Matt cross is that a guy at 6768 thats playing the three and the four is putting a lot of pressure on the smaller guys because again SMU doing a good job of recognizing the mismatches and hes a guy thats committed to going down low especially hitting the offensive glass well his season high as a Mustang is 17 hes got 17 in the first half today in his homecoming game at BC but just a little bit more than a minute if youre Bost in college you want to continue to try to put some pressure on getting to the rim get to your second and third options be patient do not have to rush Chaz Kelly good contest from tayori last Touch by the Mustang according to BT Smith on the Applause Baseline Eagles will have a fresh 20 to work with buck 14 to play in this opening half feel real different in the locker room if its five or six or 12 or 13 depending on what happens in these next 70 seconds or Applause so Deon Browns baskets not going to count was bumped by Chuck Carris before the sequence 18 foul one andone here for BC and you mentioned it is going to look different when you go in because if SMU goes up 10 it it says a lot for Boston College if you can cut this lead down beneath six up Applause shalot this winter NXT is bringing the heat every Tuesday on the CW and this Tuesday is no different catch all the action on W WWE NXT Tuesdays at 87 Central right here on the CW Deion Brown into double figures now hes got 11 more points hes scored in any game as an eagle we got players having nice halves Matt cross season High Deion Brown season High minute to play in the first half and we talked about both teams have a lot to play for because with Boston youre searching for your your first ACC Victory and for SMU to be able to start off with two ACC wins as you see the knock down by Harris defensive breakdown there Harris two for two from deep and hes a guy that you have to understand with The Scouting Report cannot leave him wide Music open McFarland in the lane kicks it back out Elijah strong over to Chaz Kelly shot clock at seven Kelly over cross converts and tough defense tough defense by Matt cross but better offense by Chaz Kelly SMU scored 47 points in the second half against LSU last Saturday 47 more points in the first half today boy Miller looking to add to it and hes unable to do so good rebound at the buzzer by Hastings but a strong first half overall for SMU uh manage the portal and they have nil that allows you to be able to go out and get quality guys and you get the right guys and it seems so far early in the season SMU has done a good job of being able to get the right guys and have chemistry develop quicker you cant take for granted that youre going to get the right guys cuz the right guy one place may not be the right guy another place and building that chemistry and the infield and his staff have done a great job they have improved so much since the the start of the season in late mid uh early mid November good strong attack to begin the second half from BC and a couple free throws coming with a chance to cut it to five Im not sure if that last foul may have been on youa yeah they did calling on him and youre right and thats his third and he has not been able to get any kind of Rhythm for this game but played four minutes yeah and then coming right out Donald Han Jr love the fact that you start the game out attacking that Rim if you want to be aggressive and I thought thats what they did early in the first half so heres Donald Han Jr oral Grant said hes a thirdyear player but just his second year on the court he hasnt played a ton a very different role this year than he was in last year year before comes from a basketball family his dad Donald senior threeyear captain at Virginia double figures in the first half for hand and he knocks down a pair at the line to cut it to five eons ago when I played I thought that for me coming out of the half it was essential to get going because a lot of times you see Matt cross pick up for where he left off knocking down the three you come out of the locker room sometimes it takes teams a minute to warm back up but those first four minutes are essential at being able to establish your offense and make sure that you get a rhythm going early that cross has 20 points with 19 minutes and change to play hand rejected by Applause yigu Boy bursting into Beetle spots up rebound deflected strong caral it Beetle leaves it for brown and that little possession right there Beetle was able to go he could have gone to the bask but he waited got the ball over to Brown and again taking advantage of opportunity to get those threes are good as you see nobodys missing right now brown and coming out of the half both teams said you know what okay we started out a little cold its a little cool its warmer inside lets come out with a great great start two teams combined are 13 of 18 from three in the ball game SMU 7 for eight Donald Han Jr cant keep it going but on the offensive BL Brown keeps it alive third chance for Elijah strong and hes going to the line last time SMU had fallen back into a Zone great opportunity for you to crash to boards that time Elijah strong goes in for that offensive rebound line El so two free throws for strong the Charlotte native scored five points grab W seven rebounds in the first Applause half by the way if youre looking for a Cable News Network which respects all Americans then you have a new home with news Nation Cy news nation is Americas most trusted Cable News Network to find newsnation on your screen go to newsnation Music nowcom sevenpoint lead for SM U yigu lost it strong comes up with a loose ball numbers for BC hand in the corner comes up short yigu secures the rebound missed opportunity there this opportunity because they were 402 good recovery for SMU and Edwards finds the open spot in transition theyre going to count the basket but then call foul on SMU and if its on yigu its is fourth and theyre going to review it because strong is still down theres been some spice and physicality to this game from the outset good to see Elijah pop back up but uh the basket is good stretches the lead to 10 be reviewing the foul to see if theres going to be an upgrade Chris Capco already got one technical earlier today from Brent Hampton that particular official they havent liked how yiga has been officiated from the very start of this game all right let take a look you see the the replay shows obviously the shot a three then you see yigo to thats not going the angle disappears from our from our screen and it seemed like he may have given Elijah strong a backside shove ran that that sequence for Boston College they had a fouron two didnt cash in and then left Edwards open in transition at the other end well those are the things that I think think that when we talked to Errol grant that you have to capitalize on when you have the advantage you got to make sure the guys are running the way the the lanes and you cant occupy one guy by two when I say that if one guy on defense is able to be can guard two other guys it kind of nullifies your advantage and it on transition a guy like Edwards you have to understand you run those drills every day in practice guys are talking you get back in transition and you cover the shooters heres a better angle of what happened Im going to say thats a play on thats a foul but I dont think you upgrade that um the Collision showed that igot Tulu comes in and and he does put his body into to strong but I dont think youre going to upgrade that to to maybe a flagrant wow I guess I was wrong its a flagrant one on CIT yigu this be two free throws for BC at the other end and yigu has four personal fouls its a good thing that Im sitting over here next to you because I I didnt I dont know if I saw mishs intent there I thought that yotu was running and watch watch it again just right there as hes running and it looked like strong actually went to actually slow him down to make content contact but again thats why Im not out there and Im sitting right next to you well let me just say Im glad that youre here next to me youre one of my favorite people to be around Brian Oliver but Im with you on that on that choice I feel like it could have been just a common foul trying to maybe the the flow of the game the antagonistic nature of the game so far and heres what you get EV is that if strong can knock down the shot then you basically almost nullify that made three because if its not my if I dont misunderstand it then thats going to be BCs ball after these two free throws Music yep strong makes them both 7 point7 rebounds for Elijah and so now what you do if your Bost in college opportunity will think its Boston College ball now OPP opportunity to to make this a four or fivepoint play depending if they score two or three well Grant K off BCs first 20 win season in over a decade last time the Eagles had won 20 ball games before before last year was the 2010 2011 season BC team that went to the NIT Eagles havent been to the NCAA tournament since 2009 Al Skinner Al Skinners uh manager on that team is on the SMU staff now Michael swatz Cross with another rebound for SMU and up ahead acrobatic finish for BJ Edwards and great read by Boy Miller he realized that he had Edwards on the back side of the defense great eye control contact and he give him an opportunity to finish at The Rim hand exploding to the basket and youve seen hand come in the first half yet foul by Josh Beetle on booby Miller but I think thats one of the things that you see for for hand is attack the basket but going back to the last play for SMU if they can get out in transition poopy Miller does one of the best jobs I feel in the ACC of being able to put the ball right where his players need it get out and transition thats what SMU wants to do thats how they want to play nice hang time for PJ Edwards like a young Brian Oliver using the dribble gets a switch against Beetle Edwards going to work on Brown pulls it back outside to Edwards Beetle secures the Applause rebound beetle with a bright Kink sneakers works it around Donald Han Junior for three and Han Junior has coming to the second half EV has been looking for his offense seven points already Bon College being able to cut in his lead to six reaching foul goes against BC and were going to get ourselves a timeout there have been moments in this game where it felt like SMU was going to break it open but BC has always had a counter punch Donald Han Jr knocks down the outside Trey PC within five Music Applause your youre watching CW Courtside Saturday brought to you by All State till all the presents have been unwrapped what EV Im going tell you if youre trying to get back in into the game sometimes you need someone to give you a hand and what better guy than Donald hand he be able to come out comes out in the second half and this is the guy that traditionally is shown in the second half look at those numbers plays better in the second half there one of four players ranked at in the top 22 as far as points and rebounds love the fact already second half has been aggressive allows BC to come back and narrow this lead down to six ands career high was 22 in the season opener against the Citadel got 18 right now with plenty of time left this game still very much up for grabs Edwards lost it in the lane but its going to be a kick ball against BC Jaden h like he just threw it into my leg we thought that that SMU coming into the half looked like they were about to open this game up but Boston College has done a better job you see the lob up there called Dion Brown sleeping boy boopy Miller gets the ball right over the to Edward as youve watched this SMU team on tape and then seen him in person for 24 25 minutes today what stands out most to you about about the Mustangs and and what are your expectations for them in their first ever ACC Gauntlet well I think that theyve gone out and theyve got a well balanced team as you see Ed was knocked down the first of those two shots um theyve got guys that can can score that you can give the ball to they can put the ball on the floor uh they do a good job of being able to space it seems that for their hot octane offense its predicated on a team that gets stops they do a good job of locking down the paint get the flexions and getting transition this is not a team that just throws up a lot of shots and theyve got good point guard play because in the ACC in order to win in this league youve got to have a good point guard in booby Miller and hes shown that hes doing that for them right off the beginning of the Season Steve Forbes would love to have boy Miller still wearing the old golden black and Winston Salem strong off balance gets his own Miss and then had it knocked away cross drilled strong in the face3 youre watching CW Courtside Saturday brought to you by healthcaregov new law lower prices enroll today you look at this Boston College team I dont think that theyre going to get back in this game with a lot of ice for plays you got to continue to move this defense and like I said you want to get to your second and third options and force SMU to have to guard and then you pick your spots and try to break him down a great pass what a f to Brown but thats what it was you saw him get to his third option and SMU you broke that defense down got the ball over to Dion Brown on the backside season High 16 for Dion Edwards make it Endo has it stripped Beetle to Brown again for two great pass by Josh Beetle you see right now Boston College on a little bit of a run how theyve been able to do it by being able to get back get stops get an early transition and again were talking about a guy that you need Di Brown you being the recipient of a nice little dime from Josh beeto you see them coming Bon College cutting this lead down to three talk before that timeout is Boston Colleges ability to get to the second and third options watch here you see Josh Beetle after a couple of passes watch that defense how you basically have moved them allows him to be able to get d Dion Brown Right On The Backs side of that defense and thats what Im talking about what you have to do is youve got to force SMU to defend multiple sets thats one of the things if youre talking to ER Earl Grant you force them to move that defense and then you get the backside and Dion Brown has had a Breakout game that we were talking about already 18 points the season high before this was just 10 how about Josh Beetle making things happen at both ends of the floor defense leading the offense beetle with back to back assist hes got four of them so far today thats s you timeout after the Eagles cut it to three its about time for Matt cross sighting this is typically when you need a basket give it to him allow him to be able to go put the ball on the floor make something happen Johan trayor over Hastings for two he nice move by trayor hes able to bag down Hastings put a little put his shoulder into his chest and Fade Away jump shot eight for tayori brown slithers the pass inside Hastings kicks it Corner three misses Applause everything poopy blitzing to the puck man what a move that last time you thought I thought that Boston College did a good job of getting back in transition but bopy Miller kept attacking was able to split the two Defenders finish right at The Rim eight points six assists for boy foul double foul called away from the ball Bren Hampton all over the physical play unfolding inside been a little bit of a chippy game from the beginning that last time double foul on Hastings and trii you see both teams and watch here again weve talked about the level of chippiness watch on the right side both guys sitting there jocking for position wasnt much trying to calm it down Beetle from the corner Mark explaining himself to boopy Applause Miller talk abouty Miller and one of the things I love about him is watch him here in transition a little bit of a hesi realize that he can get over Beatles a little late gets by him and then finish is when you talk about this SMU team great uh point guard play is something thats essential three shots here for Applause Beetle close captioning for CW Courtside Saturday brought to you by Sketchers basketball comfort that Applause performs Carl Grant said that hes known Josh Beetle since Josh was in ninth grade obviously or grand a long history in the state of South Carolina both at Clemson and College of Charleston also an assistant at winr see the former winr and Charleston head coach later on this afternoon 2 o00 tip down in Tallahassee Pat Kels lisal Cardinals and BC is going to keep possession here and a couple of Mis cues for SMU that one one time Matt craw stepped in the line allowed them to have another free throw and then the other time Edwards could not come up opportunity here for Boston College Eagles trying to slice in the deficit hand tough turnaround strong skies for the rebound and its ruled SMU ball and R strong couldnt come up a love the F crash offensive glass thats where you want to be tough with a ball watch this last time Elijah strong comes in gets that offensive rebound pump fak a couple of times and you see trari comes over just couldnt come up with it but I like the fact that you see both teams picking up level of intensity Bon College trying to get back into it SMU you continue to space them out and get those gos right now you see the Finish By poopy Miller he beats Beetle off the dribble tough guy to stay in front of Kevin boy Miller yell Kevin he wont turn around he only answers to boy Beetle goes that boy and a stu back from Jaden Hastings good finish by H realized he saw the penetration by beo forced the defense to come over to help did a good job of being able to time and coming off the rim Hastings hung in the air for a while inside for cross mismatch from a size and strength standpoint and strong was called for the reaching foul on the double you know big guys love it when their guards are able to penetrate they gave it to Beetle excuse me watch this last penetration by Josh Beetle and then hting comes over times it perfectly realiz that no ones there penetration forc to help big fella comes over and puts it in lands it down first field goal for Jaden Hastings today see Josh beet going out for much deserve rest and in he did he just picked up his fourth foul really fourth foul they could have given it to strong on the reach they gave it to Beetle for the bump instead Edwards oh acrobatic catch but Colbert could not finish here comes Chaz Kelly thei Hastings freshman going at Colbert rebound Edwards Edwards ad Justice headband brings it up the Applause floor love to see them try to get something with mat cross Edwards keeps his dribble alive but then has it stolen away and BC throws it away my goodness and almost came up with that in the last penetration you saw it was come over you see Edwards comes over loses his footing it looks like does his best Harlem Globe trer intim opportunity for Boston College there debate over the shot clock here did BC have possession theyre going to review it because if the eagle had possession it would be a new shot clock for SMU well take the timeout while they look at it fivepoint game SMU and BC 1208 to Music play who can continue to maintain that level of consistency offensively I think partly because yigu has been in foul trouble BCs got 13 offensive boards in this game 17 Second Chance points thats whats keeping him in it Errol Grant talked about that being able to win the the offensive rebound opportunity because you got a lot of guys that can finish at The Rim well SMU turns it over Colbert lost it out of bounds the times that they have venning in the game I love to see give him a touch because I think thats an opportunity where he can get the ball inside and allow him to go to work Jaz Kelly running the BC offense here with Under 12 to play Donald H had the hot hand this is strong with a left hand nice moveing he set that up because hes a threepoint threat if you can freeze a defense on the rotation at last time show him a pump fake did a good job of being to get in and finish right at the cup with the left hand third Eagle in double figures BC within three Ross has it poked Away by Kelly stays with it ring hook goes for Gerald Colbert and heres the thing I love the fact that man cross he even though he had three guys come at him still maintain his composure didnt Panic put the ball on the floor and then got the ball right over the cobbert allowed him to be able to finish over the left shoulder Kelly wraparound pass was off the mark tipped by Colbert stolen poopy Miller two nice nice finish how many times have we seen boopy Miller even at his size be able to get down amongst the trees absorb contact and be able to finish well for boy one of three Mustangs in double figures Music BC needs to remain connected that bad pass on that last possession was the first Eagles turnover in the second half so theyve done a better job taking care of the ball and theyve done a nice job taking it to the basket and one of the things that weve seen you watch this last play you see that strong was able to get Miller up and then finish at the rim and in the last G Matt cross even though you see three guys going at him instead of P panicking drives over gets the ball over and then allows his man to be over great finish by cobbert using his length and athleticism 20 points five rebounds for Matt cross hes seven for eight from the field Donald P Jr unable to convert after Harris picked up the foul boy Miller off balance doesnt matter heres the thing that he was off balance as he comes up smiling at last time was able to basically s and reject that pick and roll got to the Lane and love the fact that low sense of GRA center of gravity was L to finish Kelly oh over BJ Edwards at the rim and Kelly did a good job realizing that a little hesitation was able to freeze cber get to the bask cber excuse me a quendo missfires loose ball tracked by McFarland p on B is starting to pick up a little bit more DC senson that slows it down a little bit and then another turnover Benning has lost it Colberts been active these few minutes poopy Miller draws the foul on Brown and what youve seen is that poopy Miller decid take a little bit more offensive responsibility watch this last time gets the gets a separation right there off leg and heres the thing we talked about hes the guy that gets this SMU team to go thought he did a good job of running the ball Club early in the first half has picked up his offense a little bit more in the second half already 14 and six times at least four assists in every single game this year for boy Applause were into the fourth quarter of this game here in Chestnut Hill dont forget Chucky hurns Cardinals and jir Watkins seminal are getting ready for a 200 tip down at the Tucker Center Kentucky heer the Wisconsin Badger transfer has been the heart and soul of the Cardinals so far this year its a depleted Louisville team theyve endured some tough injury Lu tip off scheduled for 212 with Tom wormy and John Henson on the call they did not get as much snow in Tallahassee yesterday as we got up here in Music Massachusetts zone defense here for SMU play through the contact McFarland for Hands swatted by Colbert with emphasis MF mfin doing a good job of being able to get the ball inside normally against the Zone the the weak the weak points are right there in the middle you see Donald Han Jr going through there like a running back cuffing that ball absorbing the contact R I asked you about SMU before let me ask you about BC I mean obviously Earl Grant in year four he has built something coming off 20 win season what are the big picture keys for the Eagles to have a successful conference season this year well I think that weve seen they play with a level of T toughness theyve got good uh presence down low good great I mean good uh ball uh guard play and what youve seen today theyve got a team that can put the ball on the floor they have done a better job this was a team coming into the game I didnt think they were as good a threepoint shooting team as theyve displayed I think that what you do as you realize is that youre going to have some games where youre going to score in the high 70s 80s but your defense is the thing thats going to get you going you see Chaz Kelly doing a good job of recognizing that mishap at boy Miller hand spots up staying at this end the fouls going on on quendo and back to the point too you know what for vinning hes a guy thats not at his as full potential right now because you know he did not start probably has some type of element thats slowing him up hes another inside presence on both both ends of the floor its going to be critical for them in their success its a tough Miss for Donald Han Jr hes got 20 already that would have given him 23 and brought in VC within four instead McFarland on the second effort gets to the free throw line misses another front end of a one and one that is a killer and regardless of how close uh Boston College been able to do SMU has done a good job of being able to still narrow that Gap seemed that they a great pass Keon Ambrose Hilton with a loud two after BC misses the front end of the one and one after they miss the open three all of a sudden the Gap is nine again Nick Farin through the contact couldnt and here we go Ambrose Hilton Above the Rim here in Chestnut Hill and and thats where SMU excels you saw Cobra do a good job of being able to lock down on one end and then when you got your bigs that can get out and lead the break thats hug were going to get a timeout cuz of the whistle little surprised Dr Grant didnt take the time out after that sequence cuz SMU has completely seized momentum must now shooting 65 from the floor Bri and you can get your bigs to get out and raise the roof a little bit SMU out running extend that up to 11 final nonconference game on December 29th against Longwood next to ACC games for SMU no big deal they got Duke coming to Moody and then they go to the dean Doan Chapel Hill three days later but Im going to tell you I thought in the second half Ambrose Hilton and also cobbert theyve done a good job of being able to lock down the penetration for Boston College Boston College on multiple occasions were able to get Applause going lets quickly take a look at the game stats brought to you by Sketcher Footwear stylish comfort for men women and kids SMU 75 in the second half 65 for the game the irony is theyre the best rebounding team in the ACC theyre minus s on the glass and yet theyve got a ninepoint lead the 38 points in the paint as will throw out as well mat cross again using his size loose ball last Touch by BC and as dominant as it seemed that SMU has been Boston College is still within striking District youre going to stop here youre talking about more than seven minutes left to go I think that theyve had some success they can get stops get an early transition and keep trying to penetrate and finish it the rim Colbert its a block its an and one Durell Colbert has given the ponies some huge minutes today off the bench weve talked about the fact that with Colbert hes come in and watch this last time gather himself and you see strong it looked like he had his feet set but did not C did a good job of being able to finish gives him opportunity to go to the rim for n one you think Packa last week and Andy Enfield said after the game you know Colbert played six minutes had two points but coach Enfield said that derell changed the game for us defensively in the second half against LSU they out scored Bo the value Bengals 4731 in the second half and smus own personal ACCC challenge well I think in this last five minute stretch you see cobbert and Ambrose Hilton I feel like theyve done the same thing as you give SMU an opportunity to expand this lead to 12 defensively theyve done a good job of locking them Applause down Colbert completes threepoint play after the shoelace maintenance Applause Music DCs got to go down by a dozen theres time but theres not a ton of time against team like SMU jaaz Kelly thei wide right strong good hustle on the glass keeps it alive Elijah loss his dribble double team throws it up off the glass and that was Ill advised great defensive possession by SMU that last time they literally smothered strong down there and I think that this game has really changed a lot when Josh Beetle got his fourth foul youre right that turned for for for Boston College cuz they were in a nice little run he was not only playing good defense but also being a playmaker absolutely and thats a dagger shot I know theres six and a half to go but Chuck Harris makes it a 15point Mustang lead and and if Earl Grant when you look at SMU being up by 15 I wonder if you go ahead and roll the dice and bring in Josh Beetle now because this thing can very well get out of hand what are you waiting Applause for oh good hands BJ Edwards the steel he Soares and scores to the hoop time out wasnt a call timeout just Mark shner blew the whistle Subs are going to come in for both teams all of a sudden SMU leads by 17 well dont forget Chucky heurn and Louisville coming up in Tallahassee its a 212 tip off for those of you joining us for the second half of the CW Courtside Saturday double header Louisville in Florida State well get to Tallahassee as soon as we finish here in Chestnut Hill Tom wormy and John John Henson are standing by 206 SMU run over the last 4 and a half minutes I said might crack 100 again today BC again missed a short range shot boy Miller behind the back brings it outside to the corner 80 run most recently and on the Ricochet the ball finds cobbert he stays with it 8869 Mustangs and boy Miller that last time even though he didnt score forced the rotation for BC and then allow Cobra to come over that opportunity and Boston College having problems with this Zone from SMU a couple of times you get the ball in the middle youre not able to finish it LO the penetration Again by booby Miller comes over and it forced the H by hazings cobra over there first time doesnt get it gathers himself and finishes it again on the second time this was 6663 not that long ago snu has broken it open bopy Miller no that cross with an offensive board seven rebounds for cross boy says why not another offensive board for Ma cross his family and friends behind the SMU bench going nuts Colbert uses his strength up it under and you see right now SMU imposing their will offensive rebounds finishes expanded this lead up to 21 BC desperately needs a basket and they step out of bounds what has happened to the the Eagles well it seems that that this last time watch cobbert you got a smaller Dion Brown is able to keep his foot and goes to the other side of the Rim second chance opportunities have really been doing it in special this last three to four minute run Earl Grant still has three timeouts and he hasnt used one of them here on this SMU run 12 straight points for the Mustangs Chuck Harris hits the front rim but again on the glass Colbert doing work my goodness offensive opportunities and second chance plant points for SMU right now they have done a lot of damage already 14 Second Chance points offensive rebounds as of late have been hard season High 13 for Colbert the lead all of a sudden is Applause 23 smus gone over3 times so far this year here most since the early 90s in Dallas finally BC snaps the drought of about four Applause minutes Jaden Hastings with his second field goal this a too little too late vibe to that bucket it is and this is where good good point guard play comes if you poopy Miller the clock is your fan your friend and you run your your run some clock dont force your action Chuck Harris knocks down another and heres the thing is that boy Miller was able to pull the defense you ran Chuck Harris off a down screen gets him wide open uncontested three 10 for 15 Beyond The Ark the Mustang 667 strong rejected by Jerell Colbert again bopy to the basket this is ridiculous right now SMU on a roll and they are on a roll they get a stop on one and booby Miller just gets down Hill hes a blurring F transition how about this SMU team what was a tight game early they blown it up its not supposed to be this easy on the road in the ACC poopy Miller started his career at Central Michigan then the Wake Forest and now hes a smiling SMU Mustang Music to Applause he Applause Applause Music Applause off lets take a look at todays game summary presented by Pacific Life creating Financial Security for nearly 160 years SMU overpowering Boston College in the second half and a lot of it was Boy Miller turning up his offense I thought he did a good job of getting everyone else involved and you see of his 18 points 12 of them coming in the second half and I just thought that SMU did a better job of being able to shut down Boston College They carried over how well they shot the game shot the ball in the first half 59 in the first F 69 already 52 points in the paint arent your calendar Brian two weeks from today Duke at SMU be a good ball game toet gner into the game for the first time for the Mustangs Austin College cuts it back to a 24o gap SMU on the verge of crossing over 100 for the 4 fourth time this season AJ George fouled from behind first minutes of the day for AJ George the Junior from Fresno transfer from Long Beach State played in the big dance last year averaged 10 and a half points a game for Long Beach State if I would tell you for those ACC fans who hadnt seen this SMU team play you see that they team that you know second in the conference and point score you would think that they just do a lot of up and down but this is a really good defensive Applause team for those of you joining us for the second half for the CW Courtside Saturday double header Louisville Florida State well get you to Tallahassee as soon as were done here in Chestnut Hill tip off scheduled for 212 pm Eastern so stay with us right here on the CW Music we tick toward two minutes left was a close game into the Midway point of the first half but derell colber has changed the game at both ends for SMU and I thought Cobra did he came in and like you say on both ends he locked down the rim when Boston College was making a little bit of a run and they narrowed that lead that and the fact that this is a team that does a good job of being able to spread the ball around and theyve got and go get you a bucket in addition to 13 points and six boards Colbert also has two blocks and a steel in 21 minutes Harris picks up his third foul JS Jaden Hastings on the day he made his first collegate start metri freshman from Orlando Applause 9875 BC back in Action here at County forum next Saturday against the Florida state seminal who are coming up in just a few minutes rare mistake for SMU in the second half gives us a chance to take a look at todays player of the game brought to you by Progressive Insurance save when you bundle Auto home and motorcycle insurance visit progressivecom Kevin poopy Miller 18 points seven board uh seven assists both exceeding his season averages yeah I thought he broke the game open for SM you especially in that second half with his play when you look at his night we talked about him and how hes the guy that gets him going this the head of the snake but going back to this SMU team this is a team that had four players and double double digit figures in the first half we talked about Matt cross and the game that he was having but then you have bopy Miller then you talk about Crawford excuse me cobbert and those are the guys that stepped up for this team this SMU team is showing that 2 and0 in the ACC is a really good start business trip for SMU dont forget Louisville Florida State coming up mentioned it earlier Leonard Hamilton trying to pass Gary Williams for fourth place by himself ACC conference wins for head coaches three guys ahead of Leonard Mike shashy Dean Smith Roy Williams pretty good company I was going to say those guys werent bad they know a little got a little little basketball knowledge when you compare them won a few games if you could look at
