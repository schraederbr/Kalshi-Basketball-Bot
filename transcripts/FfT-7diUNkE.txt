theyve been dinged up with different injuries the opening tip controlled by Miami and the home white Pit the traveling blue and gold who are underway from watsco Applause center 48th alltime meeting between the programs goes all the way back to 1947 popper gets him on the board and hes going to be a huge key for them I thought in November December he was one of the best players in the conference uh he been slow coming back from that ankle injury thats a big confidence builder for him and he missed that game at Wake Forest which was an overtime loss for the canes on the road Matthew Cleveland had a chance to win it in regulation thats a three from pit and we will see a lot of that during the game Zack Austin gets him rolling with a three ball from both teams and hes not one of their better Shooters either under 27 but yeah both of these teams T and even in transitional launch the three oh Mir in traffic they work it to popler held the Finish missed the shot both of these teams Mike are tied for the league lead in made threes per game they both make 93 per game trying to work the interior bounces out itll stay with the Panthers and Hinson hits been better on the road shooting threes which is a little bit unusual yeah they make over 11 threes per game away from Peterson Event Center thats front rim and popper with the board after the Miss from Carrington good to know the Oakland Zoo back in back in Action this year Nigel pack for Miami and this is a its going to be interesting you got a very good an old backourt for Miami against a very young but talented back court for pit terrific matchup this afternoon 106th career game for Pat could not stay with his man driving to the bucket Jaylen low The Freshman from Missouri City Texas well folks in case you didnt know it hes a lefty and you need to sit on that left hand or hes going to get to the rim as quick as that 12 points in the win at Georgia Tech for low omir ripping the ropes for Miami and its a three this the new part of his game I mean it it showed itself in the my in the Notre Dame game where he had 33 and a couple of a couple of those were threes early in that game and omir was 12 of 14 shooting Mike and that went on the road gets not aim this week still room for improvement con hes bringing it up right now A oneman fast break one on Three omir it gets knocked out of bounds and it will stay with Miami we talked about it and this you know its going to be interesting cuz when he did this against Notre Dame it set up drives for him guys were biting on a pump fake and he got into the lane so lets see if he uses that to his Advantage yeah these teams tied at the top of the ACC and as Mike mentioned pit shoots it even better away from Pittsburgh on the road thats probably why theyve won three games on the road Mike in a row in the ACCC pack fancy dribble and basket well you know its funny that Jeff kable told us he said maybe the best thing for us was to to get on the road and uh find ourselves a little bit and uh his team certainly has done that in the last five games I mean that win last Saturday Mike on the road add Duke after they lost the Duke by 22 earlier in the season just a few days prior to that Victory well once you see what you know when you have that you know you have that game tape to look at and you have that experience uh you know that thats just like gold for the rest of the year thats how we can play every game Joseph kicks it out pack lines it up and knocks it Applause down well this Miami team I just it it hasnt been the case in the ACC but they have been an elite shooting team for most of the year and certainly five of seven to start with top threepoint shooting team in the conference 39 for Miami theyre in the midst of an 80 run Hinson around his Defender driving against omir stuff the first shot lost it on the way up the second time and it will stay with pit how about the challenge at the rim and not known really as a shot blocker but you know then they drove Hinson off the threepoint line and great job of keeping his verticality there and actually it was the backboard that got him the second time but he was forced underneath but they were Im sure they just want to try to drive Hinson off that threepoint line This is Hinson for three deep in the shot clock George has it weak Applause side hean George came alive Mike with 21 in the loss at wake had it poked away all the way to the rim slapped away by Joseph at the last second fou is called so when we come back Zach Austin will be at the free throw line for pit here in Coral Gables with

Pacific Life creating Financial Security for more than 150 years Miami an 80 run to take a 125 lead pit has missed its last five field goal attempts Nigel pack hasnt missed a whole lot Mikey leads him in scoring early on well and maybe its his day to pursue Perfection Tom hes perfect from the floor so far three of three knocking down a three you talk about omir up in Notre Dame 12 of 14 this Miami team has gotten out of the GES quickly offensively Nigel pack at his second year in the Miami program transferring from Kansas State actually had his high score playing in a Miami uniform with 28 against Kansas State this season youre watching ACC basketball in the CW brought to you by Ram trucks built to serve you Austin actually got lucky on that L he it was a great steal in the open court should have had a dunk on that play un fortunate that a foul was called I thought he got a little casual toward the end and uh but Joseph got called for the foul so Austin to the bench free throw Lines been a struggle this season for pit just 68 mik 13 in the confence going a little theyre going smaller out there looking for matchups out on the perimeter this is George had it deflected feder Applause Rico Applause carington omir came out so thats interesting you know early on Miami with the advantage with that smaller lineup low drops it off for the easy Jam what a play by low to draw the defender the thing about yeah the thing about low and Carrington that you love are the assist the turnover ratios for freshman are terrific two to one which thats thats rare usually takes them a while to become really efficient not surprisingly feder Rico leads the team 65 from the floor albeit close range most of the time pack deep in the shot clock its down to three pack lets it Go thatll be his first Miss of the afternoon better matchup with leged on him able to stay in front of pack carington twisting jumper looking a call after the shot too Tom there are some really good young guards in this league some freshman that weve seen Ted Valentine Jeffrey Clark Jamal Spearman in charge of the action this afternoon pack sends it out to Poler offt Target C Rico comes down with the board pit second leading rebounding team in the conference Mike yeah and well since that lineup change too that Miami is calmed down from the floor so you know those those matchups are working a little bit better for the Panthers so Paul job comes in for George desan George the Freshman from Switzerland we mentioned he had his big game at Wake Forest in the OT lost with 21 points Hinson yet to score in the game Mike hes 0 for three from the floor drew the double from Joseph got it back into the corner low a good job getting it out of his hands and you know I think he he had an opportunity to take popler make him defend maybe pick up a foul driving pack didnt have the angle omir preserving The Possession hes in amongst five dark jerseys and comes up with the offense of glass and gets his team a basket Bensley Joseph who averages almost nine points per game for the Junior from Arlington Massachusetts got the double digits on the road at Notre Dame with 10 and made a couple of Threes in the winning effort on Wednesday low tries the other side same Applause result pack ran into low so Jaylen low commits the foul and he had PTO Rico there so he probably shouldnt have reached on the play hes going to come out and get a little bit of a rest right now he had help on the driving lane keep blow out of the lineup last five games over 13 points per game since he started those last five omir against fed Rico Applause spins Rico just is length bothering omir a little bit in the pain area Hinson Lofts it up feder Rico extending to get to it goes out of bounds and it will stay with the Panthers but he brought it down on the catch and thats what allowed pack to get in there and get the deflection but this pit team will throw interior lobs to their big guys freder Rico Diaz Graham theyll throw it up at The Rim so feder Rico out guo Diaz Graham the sophomore from the Canary Islands Spain twin brother also on the team jge he is out with an ankle injury unavailable Applause today tough spinning traffic leot he covered a lot of ground with very few dbbl but he took took pack was very aggressive attacking him in the paint 14 second half points for Leed for the win at Georgia Tech on Tuesday that accounted for all of his scoring tough shot up and in J and uh just its amazing what injuries will get you have to be ready at all times Tom in Cleveland not playing du only played five games coming in the Freshman from France played his prep ball at West Oaks Academy in Florida Leed gave it up Austin Joseph threads the pass for the jam Nook Co with the slam for Miami how

standings game one of our Courtside Saturday double header was a win for Virginia Mike and you got the two top teams going against each other today North Carolina and Florida State thats a a huge game for them Virginia that was almost that was a mustwin today in Louisville um but then you got that group right you know five and three four and four three and four right in there need to start setting themselves up for the second half of the Season yeah well see see a lot of those teams coming up next Saturday in Prime Time Portside Saturday on the CW Virginia beating Louisville in game one 6952 Tony Bennetts team is now 6 and3 in ACC play by the way North Carolina trying to win 10 in a row as it takes on Florida State today noo had only attempted 10 free throws prior to those this season did have a start at the Dome that was a loss for Miami lchad omir was out of that game with Applause injury Carrington with the shock clock at 10 he will Elevate and shoot Austin trying to come in there in the middle gives it to leit noo over the top of the board and thats uh thats you know they gave up the one offensive rebound without omir in the game but nice job the second time around should be a three out of the corner the Miss from Jo B so far Miami is really because theyve been so efficient offensively theyve kept pit out of the Open Court they theyve really kept them in the half court and uh played pretty well defensively and Joe B had only attempted six threes prior to that attempt and made two of them Leed bounces through the paint gives it up Austin Strong drive and he was Applause fouled so Zack Austin red shirt Jr from Winston Salem North Carolina to the free throw line noo picked up the foul for Miami 76 from the stripe for the season for Zach Applause Austin Tuesday on inside the NFL the guys take a look back at Conference Championship Sunday today and take the first look at the Super Bowl matchup Inside the NFL Tuesday 87 Central on the CW Austin usually reliable at the free throw line but you know looking at their numbers coming into this game time you look at their bigs and not only do they block shots which they lead the conference in but also steals as well which is a rare combination for for bigger players and Austin is the team leader in Block shots with 28 to start the afternoon popper hes got Music it and really no hesitation and that was a deep three as well so the first three of the game for popper whos now made 43 on the season thats the most by any any Miami player this year legot hes got two Defenders all over him got the shot away George came away with it tough catch for omir trying to get back to it fight for the loose ball went out of bounds on the Baseline thatll be Miami basketball Miami fortunate there that was a too tight a window you dont want to give your big guy a pass like that to try to handle in traffic although omir is very capable just over 18 points per game for omir that is fifth in the conference hes the second leading rebounder in the ACC almost 10 per game at 97 9 and 12 minutes to go in our first half of action pack without hesitation omir tipped it Jo B got it popper midrange you Im a little surprised I mean you got you got poppler on Hinson and they have not gone to that matchup and Hinson bails him out with a threepoint shot I think they should TR try to get Hinson inside with him make popular work defensively so Hinson is now all for four Mike and hes missed both of his threepoint tries and he did not have a strong game Down to Georgia Tech they won that game despite him only having eight points just three of eight from the floor for Henson thats a three ball popper hits a three and a timeout pit an 11 to1 run for Miami and the Panthers are just one of 10 from the floor from Beyond The Ark heres the look just good just a little drop off in popler he came out he came out with a lot of confidence in this game and just catching things in Rhythm uh the smaller lineup right now from Miami really paying dividends they 10 of 20 from the floor tom four of 10 from the three and popper leads everybody with eight points hes a cop shes a con and together this unlikely Duo makes the perfect pair watch Wild cards this Monday 98 Central only on the CW stream for free now on the CW app well the big thing too for Miami is that pit not not just five of 20 shooting but only four offensive rebounds and they havent given up any second chance opportunities either so the defensive glass has not hurt Miami so far and the largest lead of the game so far for the canes 11 points this is Carrington bringing it up against Joseph coaches hate to use that timeout may not so much in the first half but Jeff capable was trying to get it to the under eight media timeout but couldnt wait with that run Austin working the Baseline at Henson fouled on the shot attempt by popper okay so you got a guy whos struggling from the floor now gr hes hes coming off a great game and hes at the top of the scouting report but in this game hes strug strling has not hit his shot and you go out and you follow him here just go up and contest the shot now you got a chance you put him at the free throw line maybe he gets into some sort of Applause Rhythm next Saturday the 2024 live golf season back and better than ever John R CH Kea Bryson to Shambo Dustin Johnson and the rest of the superstars on the live tour live golf Maya COA next Saturday 1230 Eastern 930 am Pacific right here on the CW and now for for the shooter that he is and maybe more of a scorer but Hinson pretty shaky at the free throw line has not been close in his first Applause two so Hinson with his first point of the game comes from the free throw line for the leading score for the Panthers almost 18 points per game and sixth in the ACC for Blake Hinson number two in blue and gold George backs it out with t of the shot clock pack Shimmy Shake and the shot for three Nigel Applause pack he just keeps backing up the more they put pressure on him hes farther away double digits for Nigel pack now 14th time this season hes done that and thats now six games in a row double digit scoring for pack Carrington see Carrington is another guy I mean Joseph is a terrific Defender but uh carington the young guys got to use that 65 Frame get into the lane get a little closer just one made three in the game for Applause pit thats pack come up a little bit short try to save it he does Joseph deep three side of the rim to Carrington yeah I think think at least in the half court now Pitt needs to attack the rim like that Carrington did couldnt play the angle theres a Timeout on the court Nigel p up to 10 points in the game and a couple of Threes for pack next Saturday the CW is where Liv golf

game summary presented by Pacific Life creating Financial Security for more than 150 years the statement so far from Miami made by Nigel Pac at his 10 points wow this team got off to a quick start offensively and you see the run right there 142 theyve done a much better job getting out in the open floor than Pit had has and uh nice and Im sure they love to see Wugga popper getting back into the swing of things from coming off that ankle injury theyve also defended pit well Panthers have missed 11 of their last 12 field goal attempts they made their first three attempts of the game and theyve missed the last 10 kept them in the half court and thats been a big big thing for them in the first 14 and 13 and 1 12 minutes of this game shot clock he inside of 10 for Joseph trying to ch his way into that pit D gets it back needs to shoot it gave it up George got it away in time and he made it right at the horn and he put George in a tough spot there was about a second and a half left when he received the ball on the shot clock Big Time turnaround and make by percentage kesan George is an outstanding threepoint shooter 42 from Deep on the season pit trying to respond with Hinson with a tough shot first field goal made for Hinson hes got three points hes had guy hes had undersized guys defending him all game long and he needs to take advantage of that in the midrange and inside Miami Mike shooting 50 as a team so far in this first half just 26 for pit trying to save it its good hustle along that Baseline by Zach Austin its going to be Panther basketball kesan George the Freshman making that three late in the shot clock 3117 Miami also you know as all the Praises weve been giving Miami theyve got some great production Off the Bench too from noo and and Jo B filling in first turnover of the game produces a twoon one pack elev and lays it in W and thats thats Miami basketball right there the uh you know live ball turnovers out in the middle of the floor and turn them into two points Miami is 92 on its home floor this season two and two at watsco Center in ACC play Hinson 5T behind the line is not an issue well maybe just took him a little while to get warmed up but looking much better offensively in those last two possessions 65 made threes on the season best in the conference fifth amination Blake Applause Hinson omir bought about three now kit to it and makes it you know I I think for freder Rico still thats thats the right play I mean its its a terrific new addition to amirs game you know a little three but to not to keep him out there you know maybe test them a little bit more but uh well done on two made threes threes number 11 and 12 made on the season this is Hinson position inside inside outside game from Hinson well maybe he was ready at 245 I was I was checking the clock it not a 2115 tip it was a 245 tip for Mr Hinson so thats eight points now can wrap it fashion by Hinson includes a threepointer pack Hinson the rebound and Outlet low two

and also a seven of 15 from three solves a lot of problems for your team and you see the five Miss layups inside for pits some early opportunities they have gotten to the free throw line however but um you know so far the um the the age and the back court really paying dividends for Miami as well and Carrington and low slow start for the The Freshman two of nine from the field to start Matthew Cleveland again on that bench hes out with a hip injury suffered in the game at Notre Dame this Applause week coming up on the Subaru halftime report well get a recap from Virginia at Louisville one by the Cavaliers go around the ACC and have our highlights and stats from the first 20 minutes of pit and Miami right here on the CW Courtside Saturday well getting to the free throw line but leaving a few points there just five of nine now on the game for pit Miamis only attempted two free throws in the game they do have the edge on the boards Mike 1714 in favor of Miami which was a huge win from Miami that was a stat they were really concerned about going in this game leot on the run for pit Hinson contested three from the corner and he spun it in what did the did the switch just go on for for hon at one point he had scored eight points in a row for pit and 11 of the last 12 now for Hinson pack had it swatted feder Rico recovering defensively and all its just the penetration inside and popper got turned around and was late recovering out to the three and then this is what this team does better than anybody in the conference block shots and Frederico good help he helps on the double with Carrington and a timeout taken by Miami thats a pit team over five blocks per game as Mike mentioned best in the ACC and trailing by 10 right now to the canes tomorrow on CW womens Hoops its off

recently for Felicia Legette Jack the head coach of the orange number 22 in the nation former Duke standout Katie Meyer the coach down here in Miami and that all leads to Greensboro North Carolina in the ACC womens tournament in early March the men are headed to Washington DC in Capital One arena for the third time that fine City will host the ACC tournament at the end of the shot clock the turnaround from omir with some style points as well Mike and thats twice now that theyve really beaten the shot clock with some tough jump shots George with that three and then omir at the end leit has the three at the other end for the Applause Panthers so their early game struggles from three now A Memory thanks to Hinson and Leed omir on the drive with a thunderous Applause Jam his jump shot and thats what it sets up that drive its what he had in Notre Dame and he gets that right hand I dont care how good a shot block you are anthers have made their last five shot attempts not this time for legot nor cadir almost took that Rim off his hinges Mike 67 240 lb from Bluefields Nicaragua and the former Sun Bel player of the year hes a transfer from Arkansas State pack lost it on the drive Applause Carrington waited for low and got it back Hinson without hesitation to the corner popler knocked it away all things considered Miamis transition defense has been pretty good even on Miss shots theyve gotten back and stopped breaks up the floor so theyve got the 11point lead its swelled to as many as 16 when they were up 3620 in this first half seven made threes for the canes they average over nine per game late in the shot clock again for Joseph they just lost track of the shot clock that time back to Miami make room for number 15 Mike well heres the if youre going to shade him you better shade him to the right hand side and make him go left at least make him beat you with his off hand he gets to the right its over how about that view from right behind the backboard and you could see omir celebrating as he was driving down the lane Mike yeah great camera work there fantastic shot take it right up on that rim for the omir jam how about a three would it be his third this time its wide again it you know Im if if Im freder Rico Im saying go ahead big Bella you know you can take all the threes you want two for three now for omir in the first half and this is the final seconds Mike just about a two second Difference game and shot rapidly paced first 20 minutes Pitt in Miami Carrington from the handoff chance for a final shot George just over midcourt off the backboard and off the rim on in the last six minutes well and you could take out pit and uh put in Hinson in there because he did the bulk of that scoring we tipped at 215 Hinson was ready just a few minutes after that here he is pumping up a three catch and shoot George the board for the canes and I think as he matures and gets stronger that George is going to be a terrific rebounder we know he can do that 42 from three hes got his second three of the game on four tries for the Freshman from Switzerland and the eighth made three of the game for Miami popler gets whistled to the infraction second on popler and right now too early on I mean hon missed that jump shot but uh for pit Carrington and low really need to see some success early in this half get into some sort of Rhythm nice pass inside to Henson rattles the rimen and got fouled and that was popular in the neighborhood Mike so that is going to be two quick ones and three in total on popler yeah those are two quick backto back fouls and really nice play they the pit likes to run that little screen up top and uh he did we just kind of powered through and that ball almost went in on his own so now hinsons at the free throw line poppler now carrying around three personal fouls and you wonder about that challenge Mike with Henson having a clean Lane to the rim and hon having all kinds of trouble at the free throw line one of four now and but thats a matchup lets see lets see who popper guards down if they change that matchup and all try to hide him a little bit defensively Joseph popper got the defender in the air flying to the rim wga poer from Miami well thats huge they wait theyve been waiting to see that athleticism coming off of the injury and why the defender went flying at that pump fake I have no idea but a great play Rico sent it into the corner Miss from low batted around and now packed gave it off of here another Rim Rattler and a timeout Music Pittsburgh backto back Monster Jams by Miami wow Miss crowd energize Miami comes out of the second half and what a popper two quick two quick fouls no problem Im going to go to the rack and then pack finds omir Miami on top when Barbara switched to

Florida always a fun trip for our CW crew leg it elevates and its a wedgie and the arrow favors Miami and thats thats been a problem time we Illustrated it halftime about the layups and opportunities inside that P has missed and thats another one they should have finished so youve got omir pack and popper all in double digits and scoring pack straightway Applause three Carrington slight advantage against Joseph stumbled down feder Rico alertly grabs it Henson man Mike he was six feet behind the line you know whats amazing if freder Rico gets that hes about 3 feet from the rim defi decides to pass it out and they hit a home run with it three threes for Hinson whistle at the other end but here heres the thing heres the thing and look look where he is hes got all these jerseys around him and omir does a nice St forcing him out and then Hinson out standing in the U knocks it down so that is now 67 made threes on the season for Hinson tops in the ACC and one of the best in the nation with pack at the free throw line by the way Carrington picked up the foul for pit Nel pack 80 from the stripe on the year Applause dont look at me jinsky nope not not saying the thing all I was going to add was its great to have your primary ball handler one of them a a great free throw shooter scrap for the loose ball and that Arrow will favor pit at least for Miami for the free throws theyre not looking right into the scoreboard at the other end yeah that you brought that to my attention prior to the game yeah I was looking at that thats when youre at when theyre at the free throw line theyre

with offensive rebounders sometimes the ball finds them and he was out on the perimeter and still came up with it mirs got seven boards in the game pack came up short Hinson trying to shake his Defender and George missed the three theyre just I you know yeah hes hes their guy but I think theyre relying too much on him some they need two other guys to step up and score in this game thats now five of 22 on threepointers omir with an awkward looking dribble got it to George but uh Teddy Valentine saying he kept his hand on top of the basketball so he didnt get called to the carry other end

to miss their last eight threepoint attempts feder Rico down the lane lays it in offensive foul it is an offensive foul heres the look and again this is and I dont know that that was Bley Joseph that was a brave charge taken with the center coming at you off of the live dribble into the corner popper got tangled up with leit well and this is a you know so far and this has been a game thats been dominated by the starters for Miami with their minutes and its been playing out this way the first five and uh Jim Lena still hes staying with pop poer even with those three fouls double digit score this afternoon 10 points for popler omir against feder Rico and omir wins the battle gave him that whole right side to clear out on no double team coming uh you know they Jeff capable will let his big guys play oneonone inside but omir too good off the bounce so for pit leit goes down the lane gives it off feder Rico and they can gested area somehow he got it back to Leed shot clock at six Miami smothering D pit is getting nothing in the lane area George tried to go a little back door to Bley Joseph around the perimeter popler clockwise swirl down the net for popler great extra pass great

bright brightly colored bench for Miami Im color blinds youre going have to help me out on that Tom whatever those are yeah were were going to get a an official color definitely Miami definitely Miami Vice cly A variation of the orange in some way shape or form whatever works yes they may well they keep shooting like this they may stick with it Jo B tried to go old school right there hit needed that three from Diaz Graham his first only his second shot of the game his first points you look look at there Henson at 16 and then theyve got two guys at six and then everybody else around at two

theres only a second to go on the shot clock for Applause George I mean all its you know for pit its its 29 and a half seconds of really good defense they get a challenge on that shot and George just thats where his length comes into play shooting over the top of people 10 m threes for Applause Miami Carrington pack lost it on the dribble Le it the Applause pullup one of the few times theyve gotten offense off of off of their defense and pack and I might have agreed with him I think uh Diaz might have fouled him on that play three players in double digits for the cane they had four players score in double figures in the win Wednesday at Notre D 7361 they shot 49 in that game pack got Applause bumped low returns to the game for pit carington comes out just two points in the game

Block trying to get p two Defenders had it knocked away and tole it physical play on the inside but even with that I mean you know Tom they they got Miami got three guys back and uh forced pit into a

family and its all working this afternoon so far Mike 10 made threes the assistant coaches watching their players knock down that threepoint shot and work the inside as well and at least half of those threes have been under serious duress topper now they got deflected on the way upoko was fighting for the loose ball yeah and see they get a they get a piece they get get a a piece of the uh shot on that and Miami comes up with the offensive rebound and theyre actually winning the rebounding battle in this game that is saying something against pit second best rebounding team in the league Nigel Music Applause pack well this small lineup smaller lineup has really paid dividends for Miami theyve been very effective even omir getting a little bit of a rest now Diaz Graham and a whistle on the drive noo picks up the foul pit only attempted 19 threes Mike in the win on the road at Georgia Tech on Tuesday that was a season low theyre trying to make up for it today although the conversion rate were looking for something a little bit better than 6 for 25 Henson and theyve kept theyve kept him under control in the second half and misses that layup heaz Graham unsuccessful as well and the frustrations from that pit bench in coach capable after last year winning two games in the NCAA tournament made it to the first four one in the first round Miami went all the way to the final four they hadnt been since 2016 prior to that visit to the tournament and you know one of the s for pit has been taking care of the ball and that has not been an issue in this game only four turnovers both teams playing a pretty clean game its just lack of uh lack of shooting percentage finally hinston cleans one Applause up Blake Henson at West Virginia this season Mike had a careerhigh 29 Points he made nine threepoint baskets against the Mountaineers and that was a school record in pit basketball history with the nine made threes poppler trying to hang shot was altered Hinson still a lot of time left in the game if just somehow pit can catch fire from three thats go ending it was low on the drive hell get credit for the basket and now Carrington comes back into the lineup for Pit Austin comes out from Lena will send n Chad omir back on to the Applause court omir playing in his 108th college basketball game and 56th at Miami had the 33 points at Notre Dame Mike most points for a Miami player in an ACC Road game since 2009 Kanes cough it up Carrington oneonone waiting for reinforcements Hinson around the defender that would have been that would have been a huge basket cut it to 12 but the pit comes up empty on that turnover poked Away by omir foul on Diaz Graham and what they talked about with him Diaz Grahams giving away about at least least 30 lbs if not more but they want him to use his length with omir get around play angles with him try to get deflections Diaz gram a 7footer 205 lbs omir about 67240 on the entry low easy layup beat everybody to the goal for low well anytime you throw that long underneath out of bounds SW half court youre just inviting disaster Applause just like that 15 points crowd getting a little antsy Miami is led by as many is 19 pack angular move set up the jumper and he hits it for two and that was a big answer too and that a tough shot he got a clear out on the right hand side and they forced him into a jump shot but he answers 17 points for pack leads the way for Miami 18 for Henson only Panther and digits a three from the corner just like it just in the last 3 minutes time just notice the difference in Miami or in pit in their execution especially they have a lot Applause crisper little 92 run for pit with 7 and 1 12 minutes to go in regulation teams played a couple of close games a season ago those games are signed by just five points in total pack on the drive and the kick into the corner benley Joseph Applause Hinson with three hon hit the deck leot tried to wrestle it away from popler held ball and the arrow

for more than 150 years Blake Hinson Mike 18 points leading the way for the Panthers yeah hes kept them within distance and hes finally starting to get some help from other people but Miami you see 10 28 from three and maybe that percentage starts to come back to earth a little bit but uh omir one rebound away from another double double for him but I talked about guys answering the call for uh for pit and leg it and low are the guys who have stepped up recently in the last 4 minutes so Miami with their 10 threepointers thats now 11 times this season theyve been able to do that and really Mike historically over the last two seasons so strong at home 25 and3 in their last 28 home games under coach larena however pit is on a 92 run over the last two minutes and 29 seconds the lead is Music Applause 12 George Hinson cut off his alley pack so fluid with that move Mike as he hops to his right cant convert pit doing a nice job building a wall cutting off any kind of driving Music lane Leed has joined Hinson as double digit scorers in this game for pit feder Rico stepped to the rim now popper was defending Applause him one inone situation presented to pit now thats his fourth four on popler now that its a bad f it is his fourth but for you know for freder Rico hes 40 from the line so you know better to make him prove it there then give him an easy basket first attempts from the line of the game feder Applause Rico so popper removed from the game 15 points three made threepointers for wga popper youre thats a you know Jo did some nice things in the first half but uh youre losing a lot of offense there and that substitution with that foul and Im sure looking back on that play play Tom that Jim Lena would have liked he said you know all right let him have the layup and the game getting a little bit tighter here latter stages and the pass Applause intercepted kick by Joe Bay on the pass by leot Jeff cable hanging on to that basketball you know it happens especially with a younger team as as a younger back court the more successful offensively they are the better defensively they get and just pit has been so much more active in the last 5 minutes whoa Hinson I dont know about that one I mean wide of the Target that was almost from half court thats a diving pack to keep it alive hes into the front row all of a Miami in his last few possessions they dont look like they know one Applause another shot clock winding down for the drive by Joseph play along the Baseline its going to stay at this end of the floor coach cable a standout player at Duke going to be 5 seconds on theyre going to they they recycle like it was an offensive rebound went to Duke last Saturday and beat the number 17 in the nation with his Panthers Cameron Indoor Stadium 8076 first win against the top 10 team Mike since 2015 for the pit program and they had they had gotten destroyed by Duke at home just a couple weeks prior to that in addition as we wait on Ted Valentine they had not won at Duke since 1979 when Mike jinsky was the player of the year in the ACC in the Duke uniform then trying to figure out the timing issue yeah so its going to theyre going to have its there was no change of or there was no offensive re so its going to be five should be 5 seconds on the shot clock but yeah Sam Clancy and the pit Panthers came into Cameron that was just a year after your trip to the final four in 78 then we return the favor up in the Berg the next Music year Panthers three and one in conference play on the road the three straight wins Louisville Duke and then Georgia tackle on Tuesday 7264 theyve one two in a row and three in a row on the road omir had it pop out quite just enough of a bother by freder Rico to make that uh you know to block the Applause dunk theres a chance to cut it the single digits perhaps perhaps Carrington George recovered reached in and a late whistle both teams now 16 foul so they both be in the bonus coming in and that was a that was a late bail out right there and good call I mean it was you know the reach in but heres the thing defensively lets look at omir cuz he can really play off feder Rico and be like a just kind of roing linebacker out there defensively Le it with the shot clock inside of 10 stop and start drive into the teeth of the D Fall Away Carrington Joseph high for the Applause rebound the big board by benley Joseph in a crowd Kean George has been a huge on the glass as well eight rebounds for him in this game omir his Defender left him double fisted Rim rocker n Chad omir see and what what you do with omir you pull him out you pull the shot blocking out of the lane you get five out and uh just a nice pick and roll and its going to be team thats going to be foul number seven its on omir trying to go for the steel heres the look nobody to back up the play inside everybody spread out just really nicely executed bonus situation and one andone six of 12 from the line for pit Mike theyve left a few points at the free throw line yeah and given the fact too that Miami at home is theyre only two of four in the game so far I mean they theyve taken a ton of Threes half of their field goal attempts first attempts for low Applause again the Panthers 13th as a team from the line 68 looking up at that scoreboard which right now favors Miami Applause 6452 put that one on the band maybe pick keeps it alive Hinson hes got a three fourpoint turnaround just like that and how did I dont know how he got the offensive rebound on the Miss free throw so thats four made threes in the game for Hinson and 21 points 154 run by pit inside a four minutes to go in Music regulation pack omir follows the Miss great defense and uh one of the best in the country on the offensive glass cleaning things up the lead back to double digits air now with 18 points carington out of the corner Fall Away skilled move from The Freshman Mike wow and hes just saying maybe lets just try to finish this game out he was one for 10 from the floor before that made shot second in freshman scoring and rebounding this season Carlton Carrington The Freshman from Baltimore Maryland just 18 years old one of the youngest players in college basketball pack back iron carington also had a triple double this season looking for the three green it rattles in jayen low for the Panthers and its a sixpoint game

hson like almost for the first 30 minutes to singlehandedly kept pit in this game kept them within range as threepoint shooting has uh continued On Target but you know what time you look at this run by pit really started when popper picked up up that fourth foul and hes out of the game theyre missing his offense Miami led by 19 points at the 9 and a half minute Mark of the second half since then a 196 run by pit and popper is back in now with the four personal fouls Joseph on the drive its going to be one and one low with the contact second on low thats you know both with pack especially with Joseph very solid at the free throw line especially important on the front end of the one andone 86 of the Season benley Joseph Joseph Now 26 of 30 on the Year from the Music line the guy is really just over his career hes a money guy in the last five minutes of ball games he benley Jose is going to be on the floor for this team the lead was six its now eight thanks to the Joseph free throws closing in on two minutes to go in regulation Le it leg it with a three RI of the ropes for the Panthers and all of a sudden now theyve matched Miami in threepoint made field goals with 10 these are the two League leaders in made threes per game and they are both above their season average with 10 made pack does not get the bounce closest pits been since trailing 1914 in the first half low Applause fouled foul is on Joseph is second low is one for two from the line of the game yeah get some liquid refreshment and buckle up for the final 123 here on CW Courtside Saturday weve seen some incredible finishes could be in store for yet another one Mike jinsky wow and that was almost a 3 second call on low but he was able to find a way to force a foul in that situation and get himself to the free throw line again pit Trail by 11 at halftime 40 to 29 and at one point in this second half it was a 19point Miami lead and now its one possession amazing you we were at the 10minute Mark there was just a lot of frustration on the pit bench which were very close to and now a lot of Applause Life pack poppler Rises up with eight on the shot clock and knocks down the jumper why not an easy thing to do to be out of the game with foul issues were inside of a minute to go fight on the glass Carrington trying to save it does to feder Rico low for three low makes it timeout Panthers down by two after the low three offensive rebound feder Rico gets him a recycle on the shot really got a nice Rush up the floor and uh I tell you what Carrington really made that play made it happen good awareness good find on the perimeter everybody scattered defensively Panthers have made five of their last six shot attempts theyre up to 11 made threes in the game on 35 Music attempts dont forget Courtside Saturday next Saturday starts at 530 Eastern 0 Pacific note the times for tip off for Courtside Saturday next week were not done with Courtside Saturday this week no and uh what this has just been a a terrific effort by pit just not giving in on this game a little token pressure up the Applause floor see if they get some sort sort of screen roll action with omir out Applause front 35 seconds to go in regulation its going to come late right Applause here pack whos got 17 points finds popper keep an eye on that shot clock its down to six popper over Carrington thats a three comes up well short into the arms of Hinson boy popper was very casual with with that with the clock running down 10 seconds left at a timeout pit strategy time Mike jinsky with 103 to go P will try to draw something up for this possession Panthers down double digits at halftime at one point it was 19 they have fought all the way back on the strength of play play like that one from Carrington and that one a three from low getting a kind bounce let go theyve gotten other guys I mean low now with 17 points in the game leged really is stepped up with 14 so Hinson has had some help offensively you know theyve seen some threepoint shots go down Miami on the other hand theyre threepoint shooting three of 13 in the second half so thats dried up a little bit you know a lot for them now Ive been you know its going to be interesting I received 27 to 10 runs I have always been a guy to go for the win on the road um but you got popper with four fouls so you can you know not the worst thing in the world if you get something going to the rim try to get a threepoint play the oldfashioned way really popper is the only player in the game right now in foul trouble yep but a lot of this big run by pit started when he picked up that fourth foul and was out of of the game so you got 103 seconds left if they go with the jinsky strategy you want to shoot that three with some time for that offensive board try to get the two for the tie and you know for if youre Miami Im Im locking in on now keep your eye hinsons taking the ball out of bounds you better be locked in on him wherever he now hes going to come out going to make somebody other than Hinson beat you and definitely no foul so its leg on the inbounds Henson leads the way with four made threes into the back court and low trying not to touch it now the clock starts moving low guarded by omir knocked away to George hit never got the shot away theyre looking for a foul and not getting it in fact the foul was called on Pitch at the tail end of the sequence this is low lets take a look at omir did a nice job just recovering a lot of contact and uh if I was just lets take a look at it from this Applause angle thats what that thats about as close as you can get and looking at his feet and it almost looked like it was only it was going to be a twopoint shot too you know statistically speaking Mike the third block of the game for omir only had 12 all Seas seon prior to today and now his teammate Kean George is at the free throw line its only 18 on the game clock pit does not have a timeout and George only been to the line 16 times this year so maybe shooting an unbelievable percentage but pit has got still plenty of time to get a gather one dribble and a long shot again out of timeouts Miami has one 18 on the clock and now its a threepoint Applause game whos got George makes them both and thatll do it what a comeback by pit it comes up short a fourpoint win for the Miami Hurricanes at home yeah it didnt
