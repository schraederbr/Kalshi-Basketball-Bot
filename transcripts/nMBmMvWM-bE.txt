is shaking right now It is time to go Round one between Carolina and Duke and the visiting Blue Devils win the tip and it is Wilson Jay starting out on Boozer Isaiah Evans deep deep range Caleb Foster swings it Dame Sar with a corner three Boy Duke Carolina came at Cameron Boozer with the double and he passed out of it so quickly that reversal got the wideopen shot for Sar in the corner Freshman Derek Dixon making his sixth consecutive start after coming off the bench the first 17 games of the season Seth Trimble up and in with the left Well Seth Trimble is the engine for the transition of the Tarheelss and an outstanding defender Hes going to be putting pressure on Caleb Foster at the point to start this game You see that wrap on his left arm Fractured his forearm earlier in the season Missed nine games but has been back for a while and playing extremely well And Jiren Stevenson starting this game Hes on Isaiah Evans to give that extra size And Evans draws an early foul on Stevenson John Shy in his fourth year as the head coach at his alma mater 110 wins only 23 losses a trip to the Final Four a year ago and you can see five and two thats as a head coach against North Carolina Three and five as a player against the Heels Evans always seems Jay to be an X factor Hes been a little inconsistent with his shooting this year but on any given night he can put up 25 points Well his last four games hes averaging 17 points a game in ACC play and hes had 17 double figure games on the season but just five of 24 from three in his last four Still hes incredibly dangerous in catchand shoot situations He is their second leading scoreer as he knocks down both free throws applause Dame Sar with his length and athleticism guarding Derek Dixon out front Dixons 65 Hes low error in his last five games as a starter Hes done a really good job at the points And I bet youre pardoned on that earlier SAR shot It was a two not a three So it is 42 Duke Henry Vessar misses a corner three If you havent seen a lot of Carolina that is not out of the ordinary for him to be taking threes Whoa Boozer air mails it Vessar is shooting 46 from three Hes a real weapon Jay inside and outside Well hes made 28 threes on the season and that 46 from three mark leads North Carolina He doesnt make a ton of them but you have to go out and respect that shot Heres Wilson His first touch Jumper over Boozer too strong Out of bounds Still Carolina Bull As we get our first look of the night at Hubert Davis the fifth year head coach at his alma mater He is four and six as a head coach against Duke six and five as a player Both of these coaches as players longtime assistants and now head coaches they know as about as much about this rivalry as anybody Well Seth Trimble able to get downhill off that ball screen from Caleb Wilson And when Wilson sets a screen he is going to just roll down the lane And he can play in a short role because hes a good passer good playmaker So Trimble to the line He is the only member of the Tarheelss who has played in this rivalry Three other Carolina players have played against Duke but it wasnt as a member of the Tarheelss Meanwhile Duke has five players who have played in this rivalry Trimble just a winning player Helps this team in so many ways splits a pair A great defender Boy he was so good in that win against Kansas early in the season before he broke that forearm And a hold inside is called on Carolinas Derek Dixon Caleb Foster looked like he was going to set a screen slipped out of it and just a peel switch with Dixon just making too much contact Crowd just got a look at the replay and predictably didnt like the call here in Chapel Hill Patrick Gunga a big step forward for him this year from his freshman season Evans cant get the shot off over the length of Stevenson Now he can Gunga with a rebound and a put back Well Pat Gunba is having a terrific season Just wedged Henry Visar under the basket a bit and held his position to get that offensive board well positioned Carolina really needs to set good screens in this game to play out of it Stevenson kicks it to Wilson Boozer on him again Former AAU teammates from the summer of 24 Good look for Dixon Around and out and a battle for the rebound is won by Duke Boy that was a nice shot fake by Vesar to get Patrick Young off his off of the floor Good defense by Trimble Now Foster gets by him Dumps it down for Gunga And a nice feed for another deuce Just a beautiful cut as Vesar had the help Gunga just cut right to the rim to get that pass Carolina 184 on the season 6 and3 in league play Duke is 21 and one as Trimble floats it up and in The only Blue Devils loss was a onepoint game in New York Madison Square Garden against Texas Tech in cheering a game in which you and I were there Jerry They led by 18 They are that close to being undefeated Ganga with a nice feed Foster gets back his miss and puts it in Boy what a play by Caleb Foster to get that through contact over Henry Vesar How many times have you and I heard John Shy say his bigs are his best passers They run a lot of offense through Gunga and Boozer Trimble No applause This game is going to be decided in the paint Can you get into the opponents paint and can you protect yours Good pace in the early going Duke with the ball and a fivepoint lead just over four minutes in cheering Evans trying to shake Stevenson drives him and lays it in Patrick Gunga did a terrific job of shielding off Henry Vasar so he could not block or try to change that shot Vesar did that to Duke just on the last possession on that screen and roll in the middle of the floor Wilson looking to get going Trimbles got all five in the early going for Carolina Stevenson the Chapel Hill native Alabama transfer Dixon a contested 18footer Wont go Boy Duke really did a nice job of guarding the ball there Wouldnt let North Carolina turn the corner on three successive drives Carolina would love to get out in transition but they have been unable to do so thus far Yeah you got to get a stop to get out in transition Good cut Another great feed Guna finds Sar and its a timeout for Huber Davis early here in Chapel Hill is one another for the last 98 years back to the inception of the ACC and then for decades before that Jay in the Southern Conference I know you and I both agree this is the best rivalry in college basketball I think its the best rivalry in sports frankly with the success these two programs have had Its been amazingly close I mean the last 120 times theyve played its 60 to 60 I mean its its like were making that up With a handful of points total points separating one another Luca Bogavatz in off the bench misses a three Henry Vessar went up for the rebound saying he got held I believe And I think hes right Got he got pushed by Cameron Boozer Now theyre going to take a look Duke is going to use a challenge So the ball was awarded to Carolina and John Shy will use a coachs challenge early in this game Out of bounds is under review So obviously somebody in the second row of seats somebody on the bench there on the Duke side of the court said Hey they think this should have be Duke ball And John Shy feels its worth a challenge And all they can do is look at which player it went out off of And in the NBA they have whats called the approximate foul rule So they could take a look at that push foul and it looked like it did touch Bessar last So this is going to be overruled Yeah this should be a fairly quick one over to have to review the call on the floor be reversed Duke challenge is successful They will have one challenge remaining for the game Get their timeout back Lead official Ron Groover with the information So now they have one challenge remaining If you use your first and its successful you get one more They dont lose a timeout either So this early in the game teams want to be pretty sure about it but that was kind of an easy call once we saw the video So far Duke is having its way in the paint They have kept the floor spread and Duke has this lead right now 14 to five And Cam Boozer has not yet scored in this game Aiden Boozer in off the bench as is Malik Brown with the ball right now Duke a nineman rotation Heres Evans off the screen and he knocks it down and the lead is 11 Luca Boabas was guarding Isaiah Evans and Evans went right through his body to get that open shot Duke is doing a good job of keeping the floor spread And then after getting the ball to Boozer Brown sets a good screen cheering And then Isaiah Evans fights his way through it over Bogavatz cheering with Malik Brown into the game now for the Blue Devils He has drawn the assignment of Caleb Wilson Cameron de Boozer was on him in the opening minutes of the game Bogavatz from Montenegro floats it up but around Carolina cant buy one And why is Caleb Wilson hardly gotten any touches in this game Well hes not moving right now Hes got to be more active moving Hes done everything after the catch instead of before Boozer a bounce pass into Sar Brown inside up and in with the left and Duke getting shot after shot right around the rim and delivered a shot there Malik Brown just went right into the chest of Henry Vessar and just knocked him back Vessar down right now trying to catch his breath now up and off to the bench as Stevenson has taken his place and Vesar could not defend the play after that initial contact Its a 100 run for Duke and the Blue Devils have 12 of their 18 points Jay in the paint Carolina trying to set a little low cross screen for Caleb Wilson and Malik Brown just gave him a shot before he could come off that screen And Brown whenever hes in the game hes going to be guarding Caleb Wilson Hes going to try to be as physical as possible with him One of the nations best defensive players Brown Second year with Duke after a couple of years at Syracuse Tough shot in the corner BUT HE HITS IT CALEB Wilson is on the board Thats what Caleb Wilson is capable of doing Making the difficult play look easy That was not an easy shot So Wilson scores Cam Boozer still hasnt scored And Dukes got an 11point lead A touch for him out near the threepoint line And he draws the foul on Wilson I dont know that theres anybody craftier in the college game at drawing fouls than Cameron Boozer Wilson needed to take one more step toward the baseline cuz he had Stevenson there to come double and help him And if he forced him the other way he could have forced him right into Stevenson Good little shot fake Got hit and still was able to make that shot into Boozer again Stevenson on him Now Wilson has shifted over to Brown and a travel called on Boozer Well thats the exact same move we showed on college game day today That middle drive and then a little up fake step through They called it a walk right there But usually what Camboozer likes to do is use that move and get body contact Camboozer third in the nation in scoring 233 points per game This is Ken Evans the transfer from Colorado State who was the starter until a couple of weeks ago Now coming off the bench Oh look at that move by Wilson He can score off the unscripted plays His footwork his motor impeccable Caleb Foster a little stop and go and he banks it in cheering Caleb Foster is most difficult to contain when hes on that right hand drive Evans at the point Kaden Boozer on him Screen from Wilson Stevenson Hell take the three but not here Well he had a great game against Virginia at 17 in that one All in the last 13 minutes of the game again Wilson slips inside and he draws a foul on Brown to take us to a timeout here at the Smith Center Well Caleb Foster rebound but its a team rebound which meant it meant it went out of bounds and they get it back So theyve not coraled a rebound yet in this game Duke nine of 11 from the floor And again getting to the rim getting to the paint time and time again 14 points in the paint for the Blue Devils as Wilson who and we could see it and hear it during the break was extremely vocal in the Carolina huddle He is at the free throw line and we talked to coach Huber Davis about Wilson yesterday and he said there is no player in the country in his opinion who is the combination of great player great person great teammate as much as Caleb Wilson And then Hubert Davis the nicest man in America said and Ill fight anybody if they disagree with that Nicholas Jmena trying to go coast to coast Loose ball tipped up and in and Camboozers got his first point But Camboozer who inbounded the ball ran right down the middle of the floor Nobody turned to box him out to get that tip in What a a tremendous catch by Patrick Gumba Wilson with Boozer on him cheering They know each other well Again AAU teammates in the summer of 24 Contested jumper goes for Caleb Wilson And Caleb Wilson has that look in his eye where hes saying Get me the ball every time down Seth Trimble had the first five for the Heels Wilsons got the last eight And that has brought the crowd back into it with a vengeance Got a switch now Boozers got a matchup advantage Amen That may have been a lob pass into Boozer but he turned around and wasnt expecting it POWELL FOR THREE And here come the Heels back within six applause Evans fighting his way around the screen and Cam Boozer called for the offensive foul Caleb Wilson his footwork is excellent Just that one step backs up Boozer and allows him to take that shot over and his explosiveness is beyond impressive Theyre four for their last four and Wilson has three of those Bogots averaging better than 13 a game his last three Cant quite get into the paint now Back out to Evans with 10 on the shot clock WILSON FOR THREE AND Carolina is right back in this game Twoman game Foster and Gungba Foster probing AND A FOUL AGAINST the Blue Devils They got Boozer with a push in the back on Caleb Wilson And its number two on Cameron Boozer with 933 remaining in the first half Boy Boozer gets a screening foul up top and then just with that left hand pushing Caleb Wilson in the back when he had inside position Hes the easiest to guard when hes sitting on the bench Thats a big play Foul trouble has not been a frequent thing for Camboozer this year Well see how John Shy plays it with a ton of time left in the first half Now Malik Brown back on Caleb Wilson Browns been physical with him but hes got two fouls as well Thats right Miss shot and Brown down with a rebound Gunga the screen lost it but its out of bounds off Powell still Duke ball trying to play with Patrick Gunga in that little short roll situation but North Carolina had a lot of bodies between him and the basket and active defensively and thats what the Tarheelss need to do they need to be physical on defense and sustain it throughout the possession Hubert Davis says hell take his chances offensively with this team against just about anybody but if theyre going to be really really good its about defense and rebounding for Carolina applause Corner three wont go for Powell Duke ball Well you like the aggressiveness of Powell though He had 12 points against Syracuse knocked down three of four from three That gives them another weapon that can stretch the defense That was his second highest scoring game of the season Sar thought about it Great recovery by Seth Trimble on that drive attempt Young wide open misses the three Hes 29 on the season from out there tremble soaring to the rim and draws a foul It looked like that was going to be a walk it up scenario but Hubert Davis was like Go man And Seth Trimble really did like hes the engine of Carolinas transition game So strong and athletic Boy what a response by North Carolina They were down and have made quite a comeback to get within one possession And now Boozer on the bench with two fouls Duke led by as many as 13 And if youre having fun watching this one dont go anywhere after this one is done Theres more great college action coming your way Tennessee and Kentucky Remember Kentucky coming from way down in Knoxville to beat the Balls a few weeks back And then Houston and BYU the Cougars the BYU Cougars that is have lost three in a row Jay So this is going to be a big test for them in Provo against Kelvin Samsons team And Kentucky going with those denim uniforms that they wore back in 1996 under Rick Patino when they won the national championship Mark Pope was on that team Those things are so cool Dukes lead down to two Young oneonone with Vesar Wild shot Not close And it is ruled Duke basketball with 747 to go And needs to trust Boozer to get him back in the game with two given the way that Carolina has turned this one around in recent minutes And North Carolina needs to go at him You dont have to change entirely what you do but when youve got an opportunity to put him in a ball screen and go at him you have to do it Sar and a foul on Ken Evans Well Dame Sar just set a little upscreen for Cameron Boozer And Ken Evans and Jiren Stevenson theyre so worried about Boozer The screener is open just shaping up back to the ball So SAR at the line for a couple Tomorrow afternoon we have a great womens college basketball matchup for you on ABC Number 19 Tennessee number three South Carolina The coverage tips at 3 Eastern How about the SEC on the womens side how loaded that conference is with four of the top seven ranked teams in the nation Well Don Staleys done such an amazing job at South Carolina Little diamond floppy and you get Caleb Wilson with the ball on the right side this time against Patrick Gungba Gungba a good defender Wilson kind of fading but draws a foul and has earned a trip to the line Well with that pivoting that he does to create that space Patrick Gumba did as good a job as you can do to keep him away from the rim but he just used that right arm you know make him take the tough fade away but the one thing you cannot do is foul here And you see with a right hand hitting Caleb Wilson as hes trying to go up And Dan both these teams make more free throws on the season and in ACC plays than their opponents attempt But the foul issues tonight belong to John Shiers team Boozers got two Brown has two That is two on Gumba So really those three rotate at the two forward center spots And all three of them have two fouls here in the first half One two two three quarter court pressure TIPPED CAROLINA BALL WILSON AND BOOZER oneonone and an air ball Wilson well short on that corner jumper Young by the hand off to Sar Another turnover Trimble comes up with it Beautifully read by Trimble And beautifully read by Gumba at the other end Boy Gunga one of the best big man defenders in the country Duke defending at an extremely high level in recent games Boozer with the left and itll go He can score with either hand around the basket Seth Trimble came over from the weak side to take away that right hand He just went to his left Four points now for Boozer Duke by three Powell No got it back Lost it And here come the Blue Devils Foster Sar is wide open and gets the bounce A long corner two for Dom Sar A terrific job by Sar to run the floor and get in that deep corner to try to flatten out the Carolina transition defense Sar looked like he was kind of laughing at himself Jay on his way back up the court Its the second time hes tried to take a three but has had a two on the on the line Toe on the line Wilson with a an attempt for a powerful slam and is heading back to the line And another foul on Patrick Gumba Beautiful high low And first it was Dames Sar that had to pick up Caleb Wilson and Gunga had to come over to try to stop that dunk Nice little throwback to get the high low and Dames Sar needed to just fight him down there Try to get around in front screaming So Gunga has to sit with three Malik Brown whos got two comes back in and John Shy just hoping somehow they can get through the rest of the first half without Brown or Boozer picking up another foul You know aside from Caleb Wilson making some of his individual plays below the foul line extended Carolinas having success running offense out of the middle third of the floor Wilson potentially on his way to a huge night Hes got 15 points already Evans wide open as the Blue Devils broke the pressure perfectly Well they did a great job of not getting the ball around midcourt where they could get trapped Evans averaging 17 a game in ACC play Step back jumper wont go for Jaden Young who had been starting in recent games The transfer from Virginia Tech Foster pulling his way into the paint but he missed it Dixon backs it back out Boy good hustle play there by Malik Brown who leads the team in deflections and again is one of the best defensive players at any position in America Well Duke averages about 19 deflections a game And even though Malik Brown only plays about 20 minutes per game he gets five and a half deflections per game That was his 121st deflection on this season Duke led by as many as 13 early Then Caleb Wilson got going Hes got 15 of their last 19 points Dixon a step back three Vessar the rebound Talk about rebounding out of your area and out of bounds off Young to turn it over to the Blue Devils Boy that was great hands by Isaiah Evans Used that left hand just to knock that ball off of Jaden Young and went out of bounds on the baseline Carolina had been red hot but they have now cooled off Bogots will return for the heels Stevenson as well Kaden Boozer back on the floor now for Duke Jiren Stevenson is going to take Cameron Boozer right now with Vasar out of the game Line drive three wont go for Evans A really good blockout by Stevenson Brown on Wilson Bogavots into the paint Uses the shoulder to create the space and gets it back COUNT IT AS HE KNOCKS DOWN A THREE What a great pass out by Stevenson When Carolina gets a ball reversal and then attacks their offense is much better The third three of the game for the Heels Dukes made one And now Treble thought he had a clean turnover but is called for the foul Right now Duke is having its way with North Carolina in the paint and on the glass Duke has more than doubled up Carolina in rebounds and they are dominating inside the paint 184 in paint points in this first half and theyve got three freshman on the court in this game right now Cameron Boozer Kaden Boozer Dom Sar another stellar recruiting class for John Shy Paul Biancardi who does such a great job as the director of recruiting for college basketball at ESPN tells me another great class coming in next year including Cameron Williams a 611 forward from Phoenix I mean think back to your first time playing in this building as a freshman No you were a senior in this building right The first game in here the first game in here as a senior but what do you remember about your first game at Carmichael at the prior building for Carolina as a freshman Uh that Michael Jordan was good laughter Hes not the best in the business for nothing folks Did your heart beat a little bit quicker in the layup line before that first game Absolutely And Carmichael was a magnificent place to play One of the best arenas in the country In and out for Bogavots and Malik Brown comes up with it Boy Boavots had that offensive rebound come right to him He needed to go after that harder He waited for it to get to him instead of going after it I think its a shooter too he was kind of looking at the ball for a little bit longer to see if it went in and maybe because of that got a late start for the rebound BOOZER BLOCKED BY WILSON and it will be Duke Ball says Bill Cington Jr Hes saying it went off the head of Luca Bogots and Bogabots is saying hey lets take a look at this one Terrific block from the backside by Caleb Wilson that started the break and there hasnt been much transition in this one Nice little step through move but sent back by the freshman from Atlanta Georgia Wilson leads the Heels in scoring rebounding steals and blocks Boozer leads the Blue Devils in scoring rebounding steals and assists Both of them remarkable talents That time Sar made sure he was behind the line so get him three Well its so hard for Derek Dixon to try to have to stop that drive and recover to a corner shooter And Duke has kind of stemmed the tide here but recent minutes and extended the lead back to eight cheering Bogot still going Vessar cant tip it in And Henry Vessar who averages 16 and nine has no points and two rebounds in this game Thatll have to change for Carolina to win it Duke keeps the spacing and the floor so spread You get these cuts Trimble with another foul on a cutter having to peel switch off All right take a look at Sar Dame Sar right here And on this drive by Isaiah Evans down the lane line Derek Dixon has to help off and then recover to a corner shooter Thats just too much space Youd rather have Isaiah Evans take a tough two over Seth Trimble than give a wideopen three to Dame Sar in the corner How about as Trimble sits with his second how about the half that Sar is having Four for four from the field 10 points five rebounds and a very good defensive player as well Boozer threw a lot of traffic threw up a prayer wanted a call didnt get it Well theyve thrown a lot of bodies at Cameron Boozer but hell wind up with a three and all of a sudden Duke is back out to a doubledigit lead What Duke has done best is keep North Carolina out of transition Its been mostly a halfcourt game and thats advantage Duke Stevenson to Wilson The pull up from 17 Has he got game or what Hes got everything Hes keeping Carolina in this one Hes got 17 of their 29 cheering Boozer spins on Vesar but it wont go Vessar though had it roll off his fingertips so it is still Duke Bull Coming up on the Jeep halftime report highlights from this one You can see Reese and the guys getting ready getting their game faces on And also well Reese needs a little more help getting that game face on And number number one Arizona They opened up a can on Oklahoma State today Were going to be in Tucson next week Texas Tech will be there Game day will be there How much fun is that going to be This has been a great day Lots to talk about for Reese and the guys on the Jeep halftime report You know lets go back to the early foul trouble Boozer sat with two Brown sat with two Gunga picked up his third And John Shier trusted his senior in Brown and his freshman in Boozer to play without picking up a third foul here in this half And they have rewarded that trust Kaden Boozer knocks down a three Boy what a great screen by Malik Brown He screened Jiren Stevenson so he couldnt took Cam Boozer out for the final 30 seconds of the half to make sure he didnt pick up a third Dame Sars pressure on the point guard position has really helped change this game defensively for Duke Final possession of the half to the Heels Dixon deflected Duke has it And Carolina will not get a shot off at the end of the half as Duke finishes the half on an 187 run to take a 12point lead his teams offense but talked about defense rebounding toughness 5050 balls He is certainly getting everything Jay he could ask for out of Caleb Wilson And Caleb Wilson is not making easy shots Hes making tough ones He got oneonone coverage and Cameron Boozer made him take a tough shot over him but he made it yet again When Hubert Davis talks about talking to his team yesterday as Wilson comes up with a steal they had former players like Raymond Felton Theo Pinson Justin Jackson talk to the players about what it means to play at this institution Hubert said more than what it means to play specifically in this rivalry Well Patrick Gunga who doesnt get near the credit he deserves for being an outstanding defender made a great play on the other end after Caleb Wilson got that steal and Carolina got out in transition If youre Carolina dont you have to get Henry Bessar going somehow Yes a very quiet first half for a very good player having a big season for the Heels Wilson drives AND HITS AGAIN What a jab step He took a jab step right uh to his right and then went left Got all the way to the bucket What a big time offensive play by Caleb Wilson Tipped away by Treble but its going to be a foul call And thatll be number three And Trimble is pleading with Hubert Davis dont take me out of this game Well it was all because of his right arm He had it on the waist of Caleb Wilson there See that right arm just right around his waist and Ron Guber right on the baseline and could see every inch of that If Hubert Davis will trust anybody to play with fouls itll be Trimble But now Caleb Foster got open in the corner and knocks down a three and the lead is back to 11 Foster did a great job of using Cameron Boozer as a screener to be able to shoot behind him Trimble underneath the kick Stevenson in the corner And Boozer the rebound Nice outlet to Sar Well Sar had a fabulous first half 10 points five rebounds and his defense was outstanding Did not miss a shot from the field Four for four Hammer to Boozer A good look but he misses the three Ball screen of Essel turnound Yes Seth Trimble so good snaking that ball screen and then just pivoting into that turnaround jumper over his right shoulder Wilsons got 21 Trimbles got eight The rest of the Carolina team only six points in this game And theyve had some open shots just missed them cheering Boozer No Bessar the rebound And thats where Bessar can be so helpful defensively Hes tough to shoot over Stevenson could not get it over the rim And here comes Boozer Numbers for the Blue Devils Right into the chest of Vesar for the finish When he gets going downhill its like trying to stop a truck He goes right into your chest knocks you back and creates that space so he can get the shot up with the left hand Now 11 points six rebounds for Cameron Boozer Good pass Stevenson open again and this time he buries it And when Carolina plays inside out they can get some good things And that was a beautiful pass by Vessar out to Stevenson in the corner where he made a living at Alabama Young playing with three fouls Had to sit a lot late in the first half Looking for help cheering Evans carous it Boozer way too long on the three Crossover Trimble cutting is Stevenson and missed a sixfooter from the paint Boy thats deflating Carolina had a Duke on the run in transition Defense came away with nothing Carolina does not have a fast break basket in this game And the big night continues for Dame Sar Duke able to get the ball from a skip pass from one side to the other and beat the shift of the Carolina defense Sar has had his ups and downs this year Has struggled sometimes offensively but this is the best of Sar here in this game Trimble follow and a foul on the Blue Devils And is that Boozer Oh its Gungba Youre right It is Gunga who just picked up foul number 14 points five rebounds and two you know two assists For a lot of freshman thats their best game of the year Thats his worst applause Jeff Trimble at the line So remember the last foul before that timeout went on Patrick Gungba and its number four on him here early in the second half Trimble now into double figures with 10 So its Boozer and Malik Brown in the front court now for the Blue Devils Vessar guarding Boozer Evans gets free a little strong on the midrange jumper Boy what a terrific job by Vessar switching off on Isaiah Evans then getting back to the rim to grab that rebound Bessar still has not scored in this game Hes got Caleb Foster on him now He needs to get the ball He is calling for it He gets it Draws a crowd and hits Boy what a great catch and went right over Boozer off the glass The transfer from Arizona leads the ACC with 12 double doubles on the season Carolina needs to stay between their man and the basket here so they dont give up a slip on these screens Stevenson switches on to Boozer Turn around No Carolina ball Good defense by Stevenson What a pass AND ITLL GO FOR STEVENSON DIXON the assist and its down to five Evans shot fake drive layup More of a catch and shoot guy last year and he can still drain a three but Jay much more likely to take it to the basket this year than he was a season ago Well he got Vessar to switch off cuz he slipped that ball screen and Carolina going inside to try to challenge Cameron Boozer And thats two in a row for Vesar Well this is where North Carolina playing at home needs a stop And with Vessar guarding him Boozer is going to be out top in the middle third cheering Boozer driving and scores And he went away from the ball screen that was about to be set by Evans and went with that left hand Hes going to try to drive Vesar every opportunity Knocked away by Sar Numbers for Duke No look to Boozer for the slam Well Dame Sar his defense on the ball has been excellent Wilson itll go Up and down they go here at the Smith Center And give credit to Derek Dixon Even after the made field goal he gets it out and passes ahead cheering Wilson averages 20 Hes got 23 already tonight The lob and the finish Brown to Boozer Little back screen by Dame Sar at the elbow Wasnt communicated very well by North Carolina They just throw over the top Not enough pressure on the ball to discourage that pass And all of a sudden Cameron Boozers up to 17 points Another touch for Vesar And hell score again Hes got six turnabouts Fair play Just dropped that left shoulder into Boozers chest to create the space And Bessar has become much more aggressive in this second half Boozer calling for it Foster looking in there again Oneonone Boozer and Wilson No double BLOCKED BY VESSAR BOOZER AGAIN AND HELL FINISH He gets a lot of his own misses That one was blocked but still hes able to pivot around and get that to go Dixon a lot of contact but no call and the bucket will go This game is getting physical and Carolina is starting to match the physicality that they got in the first half from Duke Brown up top There got to be some tired players A long stretch without a whistle Boozer The shot fake and the kick Fosters three wont go Wilson fouled by Malik Brown who picks up his third A good play too I mean 23 points in this game Hes eight of 10 from the field and he hasnt had an easy shot yet Duke has led by as many as 13 Carolina has never led Its a sevenpoint game right now called for a clear out with Boozer guarding him Vesar is heated up in the second half Somehow found Trimble underneath but he couldnt finish it Carolina bench was hollering for a foul call but they didnt get it Well Carolina shooting 70 in this second half Theyve been much more aggressive at both ends of the floor Knocked away Carolinas got it Trimble and a foul But great deceleration by Seth Trimble to draw that foul on Isaiah Evans And that pass into Boozer that was stolen by Caleb Wilson Just a poor angle to feed the post Chris John Sh in that last time out sat down and he looked directly at Cam Boozer challenged him He said I need you to step up defensively What youve given us on offense is great but the person that you have been all season for us is defense I need you to step it up on that end Then applause he looked at the rest of the team and said Theyve had more points in the paint than they had the entire first half 14 of them I need you guys to guard And there are the numbers to support it Chris thank you very much Definitely Carolina looks like theyre playing harder doing better on the glass getting into the paint doing some really important things much better in the second half than they did in the first half Well theyve had a hit first mentality in this second half that Duke put on them in the first Better pressure on the ball in the second half for Carolina Made passes more difficult Here comes the double Boozer a terrific passer but he turns it over Trimble anticipated that beautifully Hes like a free safety in reading the passers eyes and then making that steal And its not the first one hes had in this game Evans off the rim and down to Boozer And Duke running led by Evans What an outlet What a block And thats Trimble Boy Seth Trimble just has an extra step on his ladder that most players just dont have So explosive especially off two feet Beautifully timed Hes now got three steals and that block And remember he was playing for several minutes with three fouls He sits Boozer No And it will remain Duke basketball Boy what a block by Caleb Wilson Took a shot in the chest and hes able to get off the floor so quickly and block that with the left hand Evans wide open and Carolina catches a break there Just inbounded and came off a double stagger Hes not going to be more open than he was there Dixon needs some help Still plenty of time Bogots Wilson backs up Sizes up Boozer again into the paint Blocked from behind by Evans Nice job by Boozer to stay in front of Caleb Wilson to make him take a really tough shot so that a teammate could converge Kayen Boozer too strong Vesar another rebound Bogavots open Cannot find the range here tonight Boy those are the shots that just have to go down Bogavots had a shooter in the corner looked him off and had a wideopen look just didnt go came in here hot the last several games Just one for seven from the floor tonight Boozer for three and he hits it Boy just a pick and pop and Bogots had to switch just late getting there with everything else that he does well Hes a 69 forward who steps out and shoots threes at a 38 clip Besar the runner Duke ball But Duke is gang rebounding on the defensive end Nobodys leaving until they secure the ball All five guys on the defensive glass Under eight to go Duke with the ball and a ninepoint lead Theyre going to continue with Boozer setting that screen up top Got the switch again Now hes got Bogavots on him Hayden to Cameron Brother to brother Cameron to Boozer driving No call Ball still live Evans and down with it Dixon for the Tarheelss They have rarely been able to run tonight And Dixon throws up a wild shot in transition that didnt come close Oh Carolina trying to be aggressive but there was nothing there But Duke really spreading the floor Wide open middle playing five out Kaden Boozer Boavots the rebound and out of bounds with 702 to go Itll be Tar even when it feels like hes not having a huge game You look down and with seven minutes to go hes got 22 and N I mean every single night he delivers for this Blue Devils team and he never seems to change expression He just keeps playing through physicality He delivers most of those blows himself And I think what weve seen tonight Boozer has played like Boozer and Wilson has played like Wilson in this first matchup between these two teams this year as Vessar whos been huge in the second half for Carolina Hes now got eight all in the second half to get him back within seven Well hes just going right after Gunbo with those four fouls But North Carolina needs a little more out of its guards outside to Seth Trimble Carolinas guards havent really gotten anything going on the offensive end cheering Evans draws a crowd Got Wilson in the air but couldnt hit it and the foul call is going against Duke and Guna is done Guna trying to grab that offensive rebound Just went right over the top and picked up that fifth foul And thats a big play to take his defensive ability away Just right over the left shoulder of Henry Vasar Played only 16 minutes tonight He finishes with four points and seven rebounds Evans will come out as well Foster returns Boozer will take Caleb Wilson John Shier basically has used seven players tonight Jamemenas only played a little bit and Darren Harris hasnt played at all And now Gangas out of the game Wilson oneonone with Brown Remember hes got great hands Sar knocks it away Shot clock at seven DIXON GOT IT AND ITS A fourpoint game Wilson on Boozer cheering Got the switch Gave it to Foster Shot clock running down Brown hoists a three and Bessars got it for the Tarheelss Knocked away by guess who Malik Brown Its a scrum and its Duke ball and Kaden Boozer will lay it in but give Malik Brown all the credit in the world for generating that play You show him the ball His hands are so good Hes going to knock it away We talked about it just a minute ago when he was guarding Caleb Wilson Know that a lot of former Tarheel stars are here at the Smith Center tonight trying to see if the home team can mount one last challenge get over the hump and try to take the lead for the first time tonight Bessar and a foul on Malik Brown That will be number four on him Caleb Wilson came up to set a little four or five ball screen in the middle of the floor and Vesar just rejected it going to his left and tried to spin Malik Brown almost knocked it away but got called for the foul So going into a lot of bodies there Boozer now on Wilson Cameron to Boozer picked up two fouls in the first 11 minutes of the game Hasnt picked up any fouls since Vessar and not a lot Brown could do playing with four Well Vessar just put his head down got to the middle of the lane and a great lefthanded jump hook applause Double on Boozer Crosscourt three for Sar Too strong Wilsons got it for the Tarheelss takes the contact cant finish and we have a held ball Boozer tried to rip it away but two officials blowing their whistle at the same time The possession arrow does give it to Duke and maybe Jay kind of another rushed transition opportunity where the look was not the best It was not the best but Carolina really trying to push the ball They just got to stop now They need another one inside Four minutes to go Now theres a switch Trimble on Cameron Boozer trying to front him with Vesar behind Brown for three Offensive rebound Boozer sticks it back in Well thats asking a lot Seth Frimble is a great player and really strong but hes given up a lot of size to Cameron Boozer and Duke more second chance opportunities Usually thats Carolinas thing but theyve been dominated on the glass Boozer now with 24 above his average Pass deflected by Foster 10 to shoot Trimble knocks in a 10footer And again its a fourpoint game And weve got a timeout on the floor with 316 to go applause Duke by four here in Chapel Hill Carolina got it down to one briefly in the first half This is the closest theyve been in a long time here in the second half And lets make note of this now Jay tell me how this may impact things With 316 to go Amazingly Carolinas only committed one foul here in the second half Well it means they can be really aggressive defensively I dont think you want to keep this one foul if youve got the opport You dont want to give Duke anything easy So they can be really aggressive They just dont want to foul on a shot Evans could not get enough time to get a look at a three inside Three minutes to go Sar the extra pass Foster the shot fake drive and the finish Boy what a beautiful shot fake on the reversal in the corner and that opened up that baseline drive and Caleb Foster just went to the other side of the rim to avoid that shot getting blocked Hell run some offense through Vessar Boozer so strong Stands him up forces him to give it up Dixon with the three Duke had to switch it Cameron Boozer just slow getting the Dixon Now thats two threes hes hit late in this game And Carolina showing some life One possession down with two minutes to go Evans the drive on Stevenson No Bessar another rebound Hubert Davis leaping in the air as he calls out a play on the sideline Bessar ties it 6868 A minute 20 to go Boozer the drive The spin NO Carolina has made a stand in the defensive end in this second half They have been a different basketball team and theyve hit two huge threes their last two times down the court And Hubert Davis will call a timeout with 11 on the shot clock and 508 on the game clock So any common foul by Duke North Carolina is shooting free throws So you can be aggressive taking it to the basket and seeking out contact into the hands of Trimble with now seven on the shot clock Driving Boozer and it is off his leg and out of bounds to Duke But Cameron Boozer just reached in after that crossover reached in with the left hand and knocked it right off Seth Trimble and it goes out of bounds off his leg What a big play by Cameron Boozer And now John Shier wants a timeout with 39 point and Cameron Boozer putting up his typical numbers Hes now up to 24 and 11 in the game for Duke And this is the kind of situation Dan where a shot fake can be devastating You have to stay down and be disciplined defensively Caleb Foster starts it off Got the switch now Vessar guarding Boozer And theres a lot of wide open court right now Boozer watching the shot clock Its down to six Here he goes Cant hit it TIPPED INTO THE HANDS OF TRIMBLE SHOT CLOCK TURNED OFF Timeout Carolina cheering Boozer is on Wilson Brown is on Vesar Into Dixon Boozer switches on to him Dixon The kick TREMBLE GOT IT AND CAROLINA WINS IT They have stormed the court here at the Smith Center Is there a chance the officials may be looking at the monitor to see if theres any time that should be put back on the clock Thats exactly what the officials are doing And its when the ball clears the net What a tremendous pass by Derek Dixon to get it to Seth Trimble in that right corner And theres still point4 to go So theyre going to have to clear this court What an amazing play by Dixon to find Seth Trimble in the opposite corner and give Trimble credit Bessar is on the ball Try to make life difficult on Caleb Foster You get a finger on the ball and the game is over Foster can run the baseline cheering the heave and its juggled by Evans and now its over
