His defenses tend to do that They have been locked down this year We are set to jump it up North Florida 13 noncon games Only four of them are home games They have only played three home games so far So the road weary squad is set to go U cant grab the lob And a quick turnover Headed the other way are the Ospreys And youre going to see a lot of that out of the Kanes offense The high pick and roll They got athletes that can get to the rim quickly off of those sticks and they like to throw it up on the 10th floor U just could not finish that particular play Dalton Gaming controls trying to bang his way down low against Renu Shot is off the mark True Washington flies across the timeline right side Heres the quarterback Trey Donaldson Four points assist double doubles this year for Donaldson that is number one in the country Well there you see Henderson getting on out offensive glass Something coach Lucas has challenged him to do better rebounding Speaking of challenging UD challenged by Gaiman gets his own offensive board Thats two offensive rebounds so far for Miami on this possession Make it three Donaldson tightly wound spin move Cant get it to fall Another offensive board Fourth try They never get it Ball is ripped away by Ken Jackson Heres Cameron Oreo This is the heartbeat of this Osprey squad If theyre going to pull off an upset today its going to be because of this guy Scott Yeah And Oreo is absolutely fantastic Does everything for this Osprey squad He plays about 35 minutes a game So youre going to see a healthy dose of him all night long Speaking of healthy doses how about that dose points for Henderson a chance at three as theyll head to What a spin move off the body of the defense Handles that contact and has the concentration coming out of that tight spin to finish the playoff A 7ft wingspan He is built like a linebacker Im sure Mario Crystalall would have loved to have him on the field yesterday for the Canes but they got it done anyway The Canes did get it done and Henderson gets it done from the line And he was 10 of 11 last game versus FIU from the free throw line Dton Gaming No fear Renu goes straight up Yeah they got they got some rim protector Some real roadblocks inside Using his length real well with Renault And here is Malik Renault the hometown kid transferring home to Miami this season where he has been lights out averaging over 20 points a game Early flush for him Yeah Coming back from Indiana you mentioned it He was a all big 10 honorable mention last two seasons So he brings a pedigree Coach Lucas challenged say I need you on the floor more I need you to get in better conditioning And he has responded Defense responds to Orioles drive He gets triple teamed Knocks it back out Now they go to the corner Shot fake Shot clock at zero and bailed out Well look at one more time Renew just a little slip of the screen there Nobody over in rotation dump that Im sure was going to do any good but you got 260 lbs of uh beef running down that left lane line on his way to the basket Nothing the Ospreys could do on that particular play I asked Coach Ken Hey these guys are beating you up inside Will you go to a little zone defense He said Scotty I might have to roll out everything in the defensive playbook tonight Personal foul is on Malovitz just into the game Hines at the free throw line sinks both We are locked at five early on here from the Watsco Center in Miami Henderson controls left wing Renu on the block Power move off the window to two more Such good footwork right down in that low block even taking on the double team Its been a little split between the two of them He shoots such a high percentage Its going to be a tough cover for the Ospreys inside Ga tes up a three and knocks it down Had 15 points in their last game against Charleston Southern Three tonight Boy we said that theyre going to have to hit a lot of threes This team has been first uh the last two years in threepoint field goals made and theyre in the top 12 this year as well But theyre going to need six or seven threes a half to try to stay with this long Kane squad They average 112 Lob inside Smart pass Hines pump fakes Got ahead of himself and travels Getting back Thats what strong athletic players can do Can get back in transition But look at Renu down here on this block Much like Henderson spin move Hes flashing his footwork down on that block And then I love that step out behind the arc take the top off the defense and crack in the three So so far the Ospreys are two of two from beyond the ark And thatll keep it in it As we just mentioned 87 North Florida Yeah you never know right Any given Sundays in what they say in football that they can say the same thing here Purdue Fort Wayne just knocked off Notre Dame in the ACC at home Flashing underneath is Alt Tunis and he has the flush and the Hurricanes have the lead again Trey Donaldson so good passing that rock Great court vision Slips it right inside to the big guy Cameron Oral somehow keeps his dribble alive until Henderson takes it away and weve got a jump ball Nine to eight cancer and and he was playing 20 minutes a night for the University of Miami Hell be missed obviously on the floor but most importantly his health right And I I can tell you a quick story as as coach shared with us Andrew Jones on that 2019 team that coach Lucas was an assistant on uh was diagnosed with leukemia early in the year and coach Lucas said you know we helped him get through it and and and and Jones just scored 26 points overseas two nights ago So music there is life after this but the fight is underway Absolutely And coach Lucas is establishing that culture just like his dad did everywhere he went as a coach Hes establishing that here in Miami And this program will waffle wrap a warm blanket of support uh around Marcus and and help him see this through Hard to pivot back to basketball after that but well do our best True Washington weaves through traffic and hits the lefthanded Thats what has made this Kanes team so special this year their ability to control their own defensive glass and then get out and run in transition and get buckets in that in that painted area Coach Lucas says he wants 45 points in the paint every night as one of their goals and a foul away from the basketball So yeah just kind of got moving right there Easy call for the official Got to get those uh you know feet set when youre setting those screens out there on the perimeter because all eyes are on the ball at the other end Tip in Nice work there Altus Yeah doing a nice job with theyre just crashing the glass right Using that size using their length real well around the basket on the offensive glass Three try falls short Offensive board for the Ospreys Another three This one is knocked down Jackson who has been a house of fire You got to love that when you get that offensive rebound The best times you crack up a threepoint shot is when everybodys in that paint give you a little bit more time to you know spin the ball get the laces right in your hand and f and knock one down The big fella Altunus down low Give Miami 12 points in the paint And they started the game 05 Scott they have made seven of their last buckets Yeah And a big Alpun is just playing like a Mac truck down there owning that painted area right now BJ Plamer into the basketball game cheering Coach Kenan told us earlier today from North Florida Plamer is the guy that we could see really reach quite a ceiling Shot loops everything but through the net Altunis battles with it Caddy on the floor as well Thats what I love to see about college basketball right These tunes big strong young men playing like big strong young men fighting for that ball not wanting to give an inch I love to see two guys go to the floor wrestling for that basketball Look at this laughter Just just there LIKE YEAH FOUR HANDS ON THAT BALL Nobody wants to give it up Jump ball Possession goes to Miami Renew top of the key Heres the floor General Donaldson into the corner RENEW BANG WOW When you can swing that ball from side to side you catch defense trying to scramble in rotation and Malik Renew He has not missed an opportunity to drive that thing hard to the rack 12 to nothing advantage points in the paint right now Renew three of four with six points Top of the key Heres BJ Plamer Accelerates Get even Uday out there sliding his feet out on the perimeter Coach Lucas has got these guys bought in and locked in defensively Shot clock at one ORAL DRAINS THE THREE AND IS FOULED OH MY WHAT A big basket Thats what their third threepointer here in this first half I said theyd have to make six or seven and a half to try to stay close So look at that little inside out snap back move by Oreo with the contact finish Thats a Cardinal rule right You dont foul a threepoint shooter You always just want to challenge get a hand up But after youve done that youve done your job Youre not supposed to be blocking threepoint shots or be close enough to even foul threepoint shooters Well if its a cardinal rule you certainly cant do it against an oral right And you got too many birds in in the mix there Yeah Right Exactly laughter I see what you did there Yeah Know your personnel right Yeah he is a good threepoint shooter but just challenge the shot and then get ready to turn and put a B you know your your backside on him so he cant run to the basket and follow his own shot Youve done your job Ospreys four of five from deep Renu has been perfect inside Glides to two more Are you kidding me Reneu He took that ball a good two feet out from outside the top of the circle and with one dribble using that left paw his got all the way to the rack Coach Lucas told us that offense is built around him You know I say this as a defensive squad but you know four times this year they have been over the century mark in points per game So they would absolutely light up that scoreboard tonight Little too crafty for Gaming in transition The foul is committed Malovitz hits the deck Yeah the threepoint specialist right What do they call him Trey Mo Threeo Oh Three Mo Thats Yeah Three Mo He likes to shoot the triple But as I said you get those live ball turnovers You race those to the other end You take it to the basket Not stand when guys are advantage uh offensively on a break and they settle for threepoint shots They right thing take it inside The value you go to the line you knock your free throws in And the 68 freshman from Slovakia sinks his first free throw And points per game first nine games about five and he has really blossomed over the last three 123 points a game and his confidence has gone up when you look at how many threes he shot last game he shot 10 so hes not short on that either the mojo yeah safe to say he has settled in right to South uh Florida got used to what coach Lucas has asking for him on both ends of the floor and hes got more comfortable and confidence from his teammates and its made him a better player this is a very good Miami team but they dont return any points from last year Miami Memphis and Baylor the only teams to overhaul their entire roster Sixpoint advantage right now for Miami as theyve made four of their last four field goals Mason Lee step back three off the mark U grabs it lost the handle rediscovers it Washington now here comes Henderson Showtime off the mark Its a nice try by Henderson strong with the left hand but got a little lacadasical right at the finish Would have liked to see him power through the contact and and get to the on his way to the basket Yeah Jay Lucas told us you know hes got to stay engaged at the other end Foul on the floor clears throat Hurricanes up six And there it is Osprey four of motto is Yeah toughness togetherness and trust And you will not see any quit out of this club at all for 40 minutes Theyll be locked in Trapping out of the timeout that leaves Washington open He tries to stroke it Averaging 13 points this season His best so far offensively Comes up short there Oh Henderson almost took it away dribbled on the sideline So itll stay here with the Ospreys Yeah Back to the Ospreys a little bit about you know their season They Yes they have are struggling a little bit with just the two and two and N record but they have played Florida They have played Gonzaga They have played Tennessee Theyll take the smoke from anybody They will not back down And and coach says Hey it helps us when we get into league play in the AC in the AON Were ready to compete with anybody Well they beat South Carolina and Georgia Tech last year Thats right Walking a tightroppe is Caddy Uday is there Shot clock about to expire Henderson leads the break Why Like a running back into the secondary knocking dudes over to two points Thats so good Took the ball the full length of the the court under control and like you said finished with those big broad shoulders once he got into the paint Just move bodies out of his way Boreal penetrates drops it off in the corner It goes to Hines Keep an eye on the shot clock Theyve been taking it all the way down and its gotten them into trouble Wow nice back door cut by Hines off of a great look from Jackson It really was a great look and you got caught ball watching defensively That will not make coach Lucas happy You always want to keep the between you yourself and the defender and that that rim I think Henderson maybe a little too much on that way on his way to the basket knocking over one of the Osprey defenders Little little bully ball there from the freshman Youll get that every time Ospreys with the ball They trail by six 958 left here in the first half Pete Souza alongside the threetime NBA champ Scott Williams So happy youre joining us right now Yeah this there is a 20 to0 advantage points in the paint for Miami Yet like you said its a two possession basketball game and its because of plays like that Another great cut This time it was Jackson on the receiving end and dishing out the assist was Hines Yeah making four points in the paint I forgot about that dunk on the last P And they theyre slicing them up inside They are doing a great job moving without the basketball and they are delivering on time on target passes and its resulting in high percentage field goals Theres one more time here Just moving without that basketball Good job getting that ball up over the head away from the def defenders and and throwing a perfect dime right down there where your guy can catch it in stride and lay it in You know helping one another score when you are undersized and overmatched is so important Trey Donaldson sinks his first free throw attempt Michigan transfer started every game last year at Michigan and has been on a tear four points assist double doubles this season Thats number one in the country averaging about seven assists a night Had a careerhigh 12 assists last game in their victory And weve got a lane violation Looks like they got Altunis Well one of the things we talked about is the concentration of these players right Like this is their last game before the Christmas break How are they going to lock in and not be thinking about their travel plans or gifts that they have to buy or where theyre going to spend Christmas Eve or Christmas Day So it would be interesting to see if they continue to let these guys stay around here Now we got a twopoint game and they knock down what is that now Their their their sixth three fifth three of this half Five of seven Henderson shimies AND SLAMS OH THE FRESHMAN PUT AN END TO that little run by North Florida Says you can take that 70 run and Im going to take this one hard to the rack and flush it over the top of your defense I like how you said that these kids are stressed about buying uh Christmas gifts Just cuz you havent gotten any gifts doesnt mean they havent Dont project onto them Donaldson how about that projection Threepoint play might be coming Donaldson like a blur to the other end Hard to the basket more points in the paint on transition Look at Henderson one more time Just too big too strong Gains an advantage on that baseline and then finishes hard overhand Thats why you push that sled in the weight room all summer long so you can go up and jam it down Then again Donaldson taking that contact the concentration Hes flexing his muscles down there The little big man the Tallahassee Florida native back at the free throw line This time with just one opportunity trying to finish off a threepoint play Double figure scoring in all 12 games Thats the longest stretch ever to start his career I love that Im jealous of that kid Not only Not only is he in great shape with about 5 body fat I wish I had hair like that Susa I tell you what I could get my modeling on if I can you know get some uh hair to grow off top of this bald dome Hey look AI is a possibility I can get you with a hair like that and I promise you wont be working any runways I love it Knocked away Heres Renew Finds Donaldson And the floor general finds a way I tell you a little big man right You turn that left shoulder Throw that right hand honk right hook right over the top of the defender Youve been watching these big guys play a little bit down on that block 70 run for the Hurricanes All 13 of their field goals have been in the paint And working the paint right there is Cameron Orio Yeah Orio fearless in attacking that basket He knows when you drive it in there you cannot try to shy away from those big bodies This one the shot blockers can tee it up and send it into the first or second row You got to go right into the chest for all you young ballers out there Right into the chest of that big defender Get that contact Force those officials to blow that whistle you know last season 73 points This season 175 I I can do the math on that Thats over 10 points uh jump this year And coach Kennan told us today this this kids a pro And And hes not just a pro because of what he does on the floor his workouts Hes a 40 student Hes always early This is a guy who and weve talked about it you could any sport right When your best players are the hardest workers it affects everybody on the floor Yeah I I got a A in college one time Chinese poetry That was that was my that was my best class But a 40 student and youre leading your squad Youre a leader on and off the floor Got to love that about that young man Speaking of young men from the midc corner Henderson again fresh off a 30point performance in his last game Will head back to the free throw line So far tonight hes got seven A shot at two more Pete I love this young freshman right now He coming off a 30point game You could say I could relax You know I did what I needed to do going into the break dude Coach Lucas off my back Ive been rebounding the ball I was set a a uh freshman scoring record but he has come in wanting to build on his last performance being aggressive here in this first half I think I jinxed him from the line 10 of 11 from the free throw line last game And here he is misses one here early on Well and he showed us that versatility and and coach Lucas says that can be a separator for him Now he wants him to be a little more physical right Not averaging averaging right around five rebounds a game Wants him to average obviously more rebounds and get in the paint a little bit more grabbing boards but there is no ceiling for this kid No And thatll come right Like hey its certain little aspects of your game when you first make a jump from high school to college Theres certain things that you concentrate like LeBron did from uh when I had him as a secondyear player from college to the pros although he didnt go to college but theres that theres that transition and thatll come Yes he will be a seven and a half eightpoint rebounder when its all said and done by the end of end of the year Orio may have forced it Didnt get the foul Here come Washington and the Hurricanes Henderson right side jab step activates spins defers Trey Donaldson with the floater high arcing shot rims out game skies for the board three try around and out plenty of space to work with for game there one of the rare misses today for the Ospreys they are five of eight from deep and on the interior its the exact opposite deficit for Miami They have been doing all of their work in the lane Two more points in the paint for the Hurricanes Yeah they just got like you know just a bag of deuces and they are just smacking the Ospreys over the head with it and its its a variety of different guys right Sometimes its Renault its Henderson its Washington its Donaldson Theyre all driving that ball hard to the paint 28 points in the paint for Miami Renu grew up playing basketball 23 miles from here at the Hollandale Police Athletic League Was taught by his mom in the park there Transferred back home to Miami with the basketball now He has loved it Turnover by the Hurricanes Here comes Plumber That balls like a yoyo for him You hear Coach Kennan shouting instructions He told us today he did not want this team to have the ball stick to their hands on any possessions Keep it moving They do there Orioles denied at the net by Renew but weve got a goalender Yeah just a little late by Renew coming up Thats amazing And Jay Lucas mentioned to us right were going to take it to them inside They havent they dont have any threes so far tonight the Hurricanes Look at coach Kenan coming out here with a little zone defense just to give the Canes a different look I love it Back door cut Shot clock at five Menacing defense by the Ospreys out of that zone And we see Dove dribble off of his foot See just enough to confuse him Just discombobulate him They set up a play during a timeout to come out here and face manto man What does this crafty little coach Kennan do He says Were going to go zone Gives them a different look They never got the ball into that painted area where they were doing so much damage and they end up getting a turnover Nice nice uh execution by that Osprey defense And we saw coach Kennan chatting with him earlier today Theres a lot of turnover all across America on basketball rosters and to fork that and to add cohesion every Tuesday in the offseason together Tuesdays over to his house for food and dinner and and hanging out every single Tuesday It really has built the camaraderie Boy a lot of practice will build a play like that Orio on fire We are getting ourselves the basketball game we dreamt of last night when we put our head on the pedals Could this Florida North Florida squad come out here and cracking enough threes in this first half to keep this contest close And they have up for the challenge Cameron Oral 17 points already Threeo off the mark from the corner Its Donaldson Malovitz again off the mark again And theyre doing a better job They gave up that one offensive rebound but it didnt bite him They got this They got back on defense balanced and made him shoot another outside shot And keeping them on that perimeter is helping them here Maybe they can put another bucket together Step back for Orio He needs to be careful His phone will be blowing up from schools and agents at halftime DONALDSON THE LOB AND THE FINISH Henderson seeming to drop from the Raptors banging it home Yeah North Florida off of those misses has got to get back and put a wall around that painted area because this Miami Hurricanes team is just so fast with the with the athletes that they have Even though theyre big theyre quick and they can get out and run those wings in transition and get easy buckets That ended almost a threeminute scoring drought for Miami Five on the shot clock now for the Ospreys Birds of prey Three way off the mark from Caddy Didnt hit the rim so we got a shot clock violation Official said play on Theyre going to let him go Donaldson says play on player Another shot and a threepoint play for the strong physical floor general Well if you get an opportunity for the Canes to play against or to not have to play against that Ospreys music defense thats where you can make them really pay Just using their length to big moments and explosive outings averaging 17 15 points on the year You know this kids from St Petersburg right Like you can tell me he didnt grow up watching the Canes on TV playing basketball Its kind of like a dream come true for him to be out here on this floor Watsco center competing against the Canes Hes looking to try to light that scoreboard up and good for him Trey Donaldson finishes off the threepoint play Hes got nine points to go with four assists Lee hands to Hines beating true Washington the defensive menace to the spot but cant finish Offensive board No check that Didnt hit the rim Shot clock at five Jackson freed himself for a three with the shot fake Hes off the mark Kanes break Donaldson boy he sees everything Three try for Washington Knocks it down Five assists now for Trey Donaldson who has four points assist double doubles on the season already Thats number one in the country Yeah And I was just getting ready to say they do the Ospreys did such a good job getting back walling up here on the left side and he and Donaldson just makes a great pass crosscourt and finds his guy out there on the threepoint line 80 run for Miami off the dribble Hines is off the mark Washington between his legs splits defenders on the block gets tangled up gets it back and moves it to Donaldson Good good initial stop there Tough to stop that Renew defers and finishes And the freshman Henderson coming into this one That assist to turnover ratio is right under 10 Yeah coach Lucas having played the point himself knows how important it is to have a good floor general Uh thats an extension of the coaching staff Look at a little fullcourt pressure here by the Canes after that break Renu grabs the board Just couldnt hit that corner three But yes of course Donaldson now he says Hey I dish and I can shoot the triple as well Comes up front rim Plumber grabs the board Orio cross half court Second year with the Ospreys He probes drops it off Wide open three for Mason Says Why not Well two guys on the ball nobody guarded Mason after he picked he popped did not roll down to the lane where the land of the Giants are He popped out there behind that threepoint line Was able to get a good look Its important for the Ospreys to make a couple buckets here in this final minute and a half They dont have to catch the lead or get it under single digits but they got to make something feel good about themselves at halftime Henderson was looking to drop the hammer going baseline Hes fouled in route Will shoot two Virginia and North Carolina Thats tomorrows ACC Network mens basketball double header A couple of freshman phenoms lead their teams Were talking about TZ Dritter leading the number 23 whos against American Thats at 6 Eastern And then Caleb Wilson and the 12th ranked Tarheelss host Carolina excuse me host East Carolina Theyre Carolina at the Dean Smith Center Both are available on the ESPN app And Scott Williams will definitely be watching the second one Yeah Hey this C Caleb Wilson is mustsee TV Pete I dont know if you had a chance to put your eyeballs on him yet but the kid is absolutely fantastic Kind of like what were seeing out of Henderson Can do a little bit of everything right Can slash can play above the rim He can shoot the ball the midrange jump shot Hes got the spin moves Hes got the power inside and shoots the ball pretty decently from behind the arc as well but thats still a work in progress Hes playing to his strengths and hes got the hills off the launch pad playing some of the best basketball they have played in in many years What They 10 and one Yeah they are As as far as my memory serves and and Uday just a beast grabbing the offensive board putting it back up and hes fouled The ACC as we mentioned is so much better this year It so far so good right And I got to say Im sitting next to a guy who knows ACC talent an ACC legend here Scott Williams product of Dean Smith and the North Carolina Tarheelss And the ACC has done a phenomenal job of pumping guys into the pros right Not only the wonderful job of seeing these student athletes flourish while theyre in school but in the NBA right Theyre all over the place and in NBA history I I I was taking a look today cuz I had a feeling only two players had longer NBA careers out of the ACC than Scott Williams Antoine Jameson and Vince Carter Well I did not know I did not know that Pete just laid something on me I did did not know And yes no the ACCs better this year Look at that steal in transition A bucket here Was that Donaldson All that hair flying down the the lane dunking that basketball Oh my goodness The Kings really ratcheting it up here defensively in this final four minutes Seven steals for Miami Yeah but to finish my thought on the ACC yes a much better conference top to bottom You see what Miami is doing tonight Controlling the glass controlling the paint But of the eight ACC teams that played yesterday seven won The only one that did win was number three Duke So kind of a surprise Had to mention that Duke didnt did not win yesterday Couple of close onepoint games too Duke on the wrong end of one of them against Texas Tech Heres Cameron Oriel dribbling behind his back Stuck on 17 points right now Not for long Drills a three Kid plays with poise He aint watching that scoreboard Hes just trying to lift his team Give them a boost when they kind of been kind of get kicked here this last four minutes Nice little triple going into the locker room Lets see if they can get a stop here defensively Shot clock turned off Staring into the eyes of the Ospreys defense is Donaldson The surgeon probes LEFT SIDE THREEO GOT IT Malibitz finishes off the first half burying a tray Well you knew he wasnt he missed too early He wasnt going can come out and help support him to get this program even further off the launch pad Speaking of the launch pad Orio needs to get off of it because the shot clock was winding down He does Ugly attempt Hurricanes run Donaldson the maestro finds Washington who defers to Renew His drive is good Wow So crafty at that size Its like poetry in motion He does such a good job handling that basketball for a big guy I wish I had those kind of handles back when I played I could have been a player for Susa But just so good Doesnt overt try to dribble Heres another steal for Donaldson Hes just a thief in a pair of basketball shorts as he races to the other end for more points in the paint Making it real tough now Our coach Keenan squad fouling down by 20 points early here in the second half Orios got to start cracking up some of those threes that he had 20 points in that first half This time its Hines launching a three and he buries it Well they had eight threes in that first half We knew they were going to have to make a bunch to stay close in this basketball game They might need eight or 10 here in this second half and start playing some better defense inside if they want to cut into this large deficit Renu from just inside the free throw line with that feathery touch from 14 ft Those are the exact words I was about to say that feathery touch that just that softness just some players know how to score and especially when youre a lefty it just looks so cool He is uh to to reference the uh superstar Steuart Scott cooler than the other side of the pillow You got to see the Steuart Scott documentary the 30 for30 Its amazing by the way Shots off the mark Here comes Donaldson down the right side Hey you know we were talking about all this scoring in the first half A sensational play by H uh Henderson in and Washington But we forgot to mention Uday has been chewing glass Hes got 11 rebounds here And we are early in this second half And was that a bucket from outside from three It sure was The threepointer good by Donaldson Hes got 16 points now Heres Oriel matched up against Henderson who can play so many positions guard so many positions A nightmare for the opposition Dalton Gaiman That one was all the way down it seemed Rattled out knocked out of bounds Last touch by the Ospreys Look at this one more time Just that pick the ability to get off the screen all the ball handling hes been doing in a crowd in transition just makes good decisions gets the ball to his intended target Like even Santa on that bumpy sle you know Rudolph gets out of line things get out of whack a couple of gifts will fall off the sleigh Not with Donaldson How about Dalton Gaming Nice move on Henderson Good footwork down on that block took his time surveyed the defense comes back with that right shoulder turn left off glass over the taller defender Like I said this coach uh this team is well coached They will not quit They practice togetherness They practice toughness and they trust one another to compete for 40 minutes A buttoned up operation for sure Getting a chance to see it up close and personal now and today at shootound Nice move there The quick turnaround by Alunasis Yeah he is phenomenal Well thats a couple times now and hes gotten down uh in that painted area and used his size real well Think about a big that plays big not a big that plays small Henderson got wiped out here on a trying to fight over the screen by a legal screen Look at this one more time here A great move down on one block there with that little right shoulder turn left hand hook and then Altuna says Well let me show you my left hand hook down here on this left block So backto back lefthanded hook music shots dropping on both sides of the floor Dalton Gaiman dished it out and then received it He knows what thats like Hes got two brothers he used to battle with playing hoops Both of his brothers played college basketball music One at Southwest Baptist and another one currently at Abalene Christian Hurricanes up now 62 to 40 Pete Soua alongside Scott Williams Both of these teams getting set to go on a little Christmas respit and break and and and both coaches are very conscious of that right Trying to keep them engaged as theres a wet spot on the floor Its getting cleaned up right now Henderson Henderson like talk about a mansized uh body hes got Thats a mansized wet spot out And the official said No you didnt get it all young man Come back out here for a second attempt And Im glad they do that stoppage of play like that I dont mind because a player can slip on that wet surface and really harm themselves So good on that official to make sure they got that cleaned up properly Yeah 66 240 that casts a pretty wide net Here he is out of the corner top of the key Donaldson such great control of the basketball Only way to get it away from him right now tonight is to foul him Yeah Donaldson says Hey I was going up for a shot but Im not sure if the officials are going to give him two shots Yes they have decided they are going to give him two shots on this But once you get right just catching that ball in rotation swings his arms kind of a crafty move Swings his arm up over the defender as they were had him stretched out away from their body So again smart senior move there catching the defender out of balance out of control and gets himself to the free throw line for a couple free throws first pair of free throws tonight he is attempting as his previous three came on and once he is perfect from the charity strike tonight and he keeps it that way pressure extended true Washington a menace right now on Hines Washington leads the team in steals with 28 well he had to be fast with his hands because he had four he has 14 siblings you imagine just dinner time you better get there early and grab your food Here he is Comes away with an appetizer Drops it off for Henderson He finds Washington off the mark No good But weve got a foul underneath on the big fella Nester Dichuk Yeah Dichuk pushing Altunus in the back there trying to get 30 And you do it efficiently I mean not like the I Allen Iverson 30 whack like when I was with the Sixers on 30 field goals He was 10 of 12 from the field and 10 of 11 from the free throw line An efficient 32 Sue So thats what I was asking for Just pass the ball Iverson Just give it to me Im open Well those were back in the day You know John Lucas was your coach And it was pretty cool to hear Jay say I used to remember you Scott from when I was running around the spectrum as a little kid in Philadelphia Yeah hes four or five years old with his brother John running around trying to get up crack up shots when were trying to work on our sets Dichuk off the mark The freshman from Moscow His parents are here tonight There he is THERE YOU GO MOM and dad Worth the trip You got to love that right Youre coming all the way over here Yeah I guess its probably a good time of the year to get out of Moscow with all that ice and snow on the ground You come down here to sunny South Florida and your boys out there doing his darn thing scoring hoops inside You got to love that Crappy for that young man Great camera work by our crew too Unbelievable From one the eye chuck to another screaming This guy loves the offensive glass too He eats it 13 of his 21 rebounds this year have come on the offensive glass I mean thats the kind of player you love to have on your squad Yeah Im sure coach Kenn loves that right A guy can go out there and get you some second chance opportunities second chance points and thats just hunger effort and desire And that becomes infectious around your teammates as well U wanted the lob instead It goes to the corner and Dove rat Little too much spin on that I guess Yeah its stuck on some of the uh camera work above the backboard They trying to get it down with the broomstick There you go Old school I like that 64 43 15 minutes left here in the ball game If Cameron Oral and the Ospreys are going to make a move its got to be right now Oral has been held in check in the second half after pouring in 20 points in the first and Hines has it taken away Dove atones for the miss Donaldson has done that all day into the teeth of the defense This time he doesnt get it to fall or a foul but the Hurricanes grab the offensive board Yeah Somehow Washington went in there amongst the trees and got that ball Dove rat Wow Hes a gym rat by the way And you can see it right there the kid from Israel bodies his way to two Well I you know just kind of like the way Coach Lucas has got these guys you know ready to play Hadnt played much tonight Didnt play at all in the first half and and it comes out and makes a positive impact immediately when hes out there on the floor Hines elevates Had a hand in his face courtesy of Washington Hes off the mark Yeah Bakers dozen of rebounds now for U with 13 Oh the lob from Donaldson to Ud just out of his reach but you talked about it Scott He is eating boards right now Plameumber on the other end got the whole team to jump but couldnt finish Donaldson off the mark for Dove Out of the pack comes Kent Jackson You can tell the style of play for the Canes here in this second half a little different right Banging them inside Almost no threepoint field goals attempted in that first half They built that large 16point halftime lead Seemed like they were in a good position now up by 23rd 23 And coach Lucas is saying Okay Ill let you guys play a little freer now Well play a little inside out Well still attack the basket if we have an opportunity but Im okay Im putting the green light back on the threepoint shots And Jay Lucas by the way like heres a guy you could consider him you know they have like that term now like what Nepo baby or whatever right Like his dad is basketball royalty This dude didnt skip any steps on his way to the top of the coaching profession where he resides right now Everything from equipment manager graduate assistant to finding guys like that who can make highlight real dunks How about Henderson Well Henderson he hadnt scored in his first half and he went and put a punctuation mark on that basket trying to take that room uh home with him for the Christmas holiday break Cameron Orio trying to get in on the act off the mark Plameumber loses the handle The eye has it Nice bounce pass shot fake and then the finish from Dante Oliver from Knoxville Tennessee Yeah Nock with the uh dime there to the cutting Osprey teammate Theyre moving without the basketball Weve seen that three times now in this game Their ability to slice him inside by getting that pass uh without the ball Top of the key Heres Washington Coach Lucas says this is our wild card Sinks a jumper That was pure 70 to 45 At the 29th Hannah Hildalgo and number 20 Notre Dame They host Pit in South Bend at 6 Eastern Then number 18 North Carolina They got a balanced attack They take on Boston College Both of those games are available on the ESPN app And Dove makes himself available after the steel Lays it up for two Well they take out Washington whos a thief in shorts and they bring in a boy He goes out He does the same thing A ripple way out here by the U An off went run in the transition Buckets points in the paint Ospreys have had no answer for that all night long Now Steve you say you want Donaldsons hair I I I want the boys hair I love that Thats a thats thats a nice do there Heres Oriel Shot clock at four Dribbles behind his back under pressure Hes fouled Le boy got a little too handsy So three free throws are coming up for Cam Oral who already has 20 points but hadnt scored in the second half But thats a threepoint stripe and they found him once he made the triple and went to the line for the fourpoint play And again I I understand knowing the personnel This is the hot shooter Hes got it going Hes boiling to 20 points But you got to get out there and challenge a shot and not foul those types of plays sometimes and not a 20 point def when they get yep by what is it 27 points but when youre in close basketball games against you know like skilled opponents those are the ones that come back and bite you late in basketball games that you wish he hadnt done and thats the first time he sees the ball go through the hoop here in the second half as he was previously 0 of three from the floor and you saw him miss the first free throw and there is the story for him shut down in the second half I would have to imagine the defensive wizard John Lucas or Jay Lucas excuse me was behind some of that right 100 And you nailed it Is its like like we talked about Ky Um but theres also something always being a pro And what these young men are learning is that when you got a guy that comes out and coaches you in the first half you got to figure out a way to take it personal like hey youre not going to come on our home floor even though were up by 16 and do that to us in the second half And I think the Canes have taken that challenge on head on and they have shut down um number 11 here in the second half Oh rising for that offensive rebound is Henderson and then defers into the corner Threeo splashes home another Trey Malovitz from Slovakia to Miami to fire tonight Well do you think coach Lucas had told Henderson at halftime that hey you only got two boards you go out there and give me some more rebounds here in the second half because youre right he he used those pogo stick like legs to bound up and grab that one over the top of the defender here And then again always has his eyes up He used to play a point guard position at the high school level So he knows how to keep his eyes up and deliver a strike to a teammate Left of the circle now The freshman sensation controls embodies with Dalton Gaiman Dove shakes out of the corner Cant finish but hell go to the free throw line to shoot two Im impressed with this Kings team They got a number of quality players that can do multiple things not only offensively but defensively And Coach Lucas you said zero returning players from last years squad Zero points rather from last years squad Hes got these guys early on what 12 games into the season this game number 13 with some really good team chemistry Talked about taco Tuesdays or excuse me team Tuesdays that coach Keenan does Well Im not sure what coach Lucas is doing on that end but its got to be something similar because this is a a a group that seems very united Together Tuesdays its called Scott and thats what North Florida does every Tuesday I knew I was going to butcher it I I didnt know you were setting the menu Uh we we well have to let coach Kennan know Hes right in front of us Well you know the big guys always got food on his mind Im wondering where Im going to go for my postgame dinner after this So many quality restaurants down here in South Florida Oriel probes loses his footing but maintains his dribble Eventually Malovitz rips it off and Renew finishes on the other end He has been flawless Wow for a sharpshooter to make a spin hook pass a defender to his running big man catching and striding laid in was quite impressive for new with 14 points Hands up Harry defense again This time its Dove Another great outlet Almost another strong finish and Henderson hits the floor hard but man just looking at him he he was fine once he hit the deck like that which is hard to believe Lets take another look at this defense Well there it is again Was that Trey Threo rather down there He fights that thing out and gets it to his big man See the way he spins that ball pass the defender and then its got that over spin so it comes up high enough now for the big guy to catch it you know above his kneecaps not below his his kneecaps down off the top of his shoelaces and hes able to to lay it in But I tell you what this kid Henderson if I hit the floor like that Susie you better bring a whole team of guys to get me up off the floor I I do want to note you mentioned the great play both by Dove and and Malovitz and also weve seen Altunis tonight Those are three dudes coming from overseas that played pro ball overseas The kind of player that we probably never would have seen in college basketball prior to the NIL era and theyve made this Miami team a lot better And you feel like they give them the juice and the strength to make a run here 100 Hey anybody that was coming into this season thinking we got Miami Im going to put that one on the win column you better think you better think twice cuz this hurricane team is is for real Yeah theyve had a couple cupcakes on their schedule Um but theyve been lighting up that scoreboard you know 80 points now probably on their way to over a 100red again tonight for the fourth time on the season Thats something they hadnt done since I was in college back in 8889 I was a junior at North Carolina So this is a different Kanes team than they saw a year ago with only seven wins Much different And that big fella is a reason why although a little out of control was renewed there playing back home in Miami after transferring from Indiana commits the offensive foul And the veteran you saw him tap his chest say Hey my bad My fault He doing a little a little much right You you used to get 20 points every night Youre at 14 You know all of a sudden there aint too many more ticks on the clock left Im going to be out here Maybe I want to try to give me a couple more FGAs before we go to the Christmas holiday break That was the first turnover for Miami here in the second half Donaldson checks back into the ball game Caught up with Renew a little bit Id say catch up like hes my buddy I talked to him a little bit before the game and was asking him about coming back home and playing in Miami and his mom who taught him the game of college of basketball uh 20 m away from here uh playing in a police athletic league park Just so cool The story is amazing Hes married Hes back home and he is thriving Donaldson another foul outside the ark Yeah a little surprising there Thats something coach Lucas is going to have a little long talk with in the film session about his players fouling these threepoint shooters Weve seen it three three times days Hes got to hes got to go take a rest on that one and take a seat on the bench But again closing out on shooters is is important but not to the point where you are actually fouling them and giving them three opportunities uh from the from the charity stripe Well maybe the next guy who doesnt commit the foul on the deep three can can get one of your stocking stuffers that you got off the Tik Tok shop What are those You want You want me to talk about my musical lollipops Huh The guy Well its its a 22point game The guy The guy bought lollipops off the Tik Tok shop Hes telling us this And when theyre not just lollipops they got them because they when you suck on them they actually play music And that to me is mindboggling that that could possibly happen Did they Did they arrive yet They have arrived Theyve been gift wrapped I have not tried them yet but I am going to try them Its cuz they dont work The appropriate time Well see Well see I Hey you got to shift through a little mud on that Tik Tok shop to find to find a little uh you know gold nugget in in the dirt there I said it was a 22point game It was a 28point game Now is a 30point game Hurricanes have made five of their last six Wow How about that clinic by Renu Wow Thats right flashing the footwork down there on that low block That put a smile on Udays face and that was such an impressive move This guy was only honorable mentioned Big 10 in in the in the uh Big 10 last year I find that hard to believe as as as skilled as he is with his footwork as well as he uses his length and how quickly and easily he finds himself at the basket Here he goes again Yeah look at this boy he is in a comfort zone down there on the block as he is fouled And who knows anything about basketball mentions that you know hes got amazing footwork Yeah 69 240 lb Uh and hes no stiff right Like they call me tank cuz I wasnt stiff I was about 610 235 in the pros But I couldnt do those things down there on that block All I could do is go forward and side to side That was it Hes making spin moves Hes crossing guys over off the dribble This is an impressive display of basketball here that were watching from Renault 20 and a half points per game right What is he at right now Hes sitting on 18 for the game 17 for the game About about to be 18 as good as a free throw shooter he is Got a nice soft touch from the free throw line You know it wouldnt be surprised after this free throw if Coach Lucas gets somebody up off that pine Lets him go down and ice down his knees or his ankles Coach Lucas told us this offense is built around Malik Renu Looking forward to seeing it blossom during the season And can I one more thing about Leak Of course he challenged him Coach Lucas challenged him to be in better condition so he can do these types of things late in ball games Theyre not always going to be up by 33 points 36 Theyre youre going to need to have guys your best players make winning plays down the stretch You cant do that if youre fighting your condition Trey Donaldson made another winning play as we saw 21 points for him tonight At the other end Trey Caddy who has been on a heater averaging 13 points in his last five games deposits two Dove finds space Boo grabs the board Donaldson such great body control Splash The three is knocked down once again This time its Lavoy Yeah but can I just say Renu set that pick at the threepoint for the initial shot The shot was missed and hes the one that was able to work himself inside got that rebound to leads those second chance opportunities Hes only got four boards tonight but hes done a nice job patrolling that paint defensively Hines jab steps activates Great move off the window for two and a timeout is called by coach Kennan About 10 dudes and they all seem to be loving playing playing together for him Thats why hes scoring over 100 points Hes making it fun and hes getting them to buy in defensively And only these guys shoot a high percentage as well We can talk about Henderson shooting 60 coming into this game Yeah U whats he at Oh almost 70 Hines grabs the board ahead to Jackson Jackson runs into trouble in the midc corner Hits it in reverse Shot is short Donaldson grabs the long board Eyes up Henderson into traffic and is fouled Lets think about your Jackson Youre 62 Youre youre taking it in You think you got a little fast break action and then you got Uday down there at 265 lbs saying no you shown out pass forces you back outside to have to shoot a threepointer miss that get in transition run down the other end with your you know athletic wings and get yourself an opportunity and Henderson finds himself at the line yet again Yeah UDay will be an issue this season for ACC opponents already has 16 blocks on the year Remember Virginia North Carolina thats tomorrow nights ACC Network mens basketball double header A couple of freshman phenoms leading their teams Tessa Ritter he leads the number 23 Virginia Wahoos against American at 6 Eastern Then Caleb Wilson in the 12th ranked Tarheelss host East Carolina at the Dean Smith Center Both are available on ESPN the app also Henderson who was 10 of 11 in that 30point outburst he had last game is now from the free throw line five of nine Yeah I mean just you know cool 18 points again Ne needs to chew more glass get on the glass both defensively and offensively Hes got those live legs Just going to have to box out a little bit better Cant just run to the basket on every shot attempt like you cant the high school level And thats something that you have to learn with overtime I I like where this young man is here 12 games into the season You got to like that extra pass and the finish put back by Henderson just hanging out around the rim Taking over in Miami like a kingpin Well talk about getting on the offensive glass Right And then Ron Q he goes up and slams one on with the sl the slam dunk finish So nice job by that young man getting on that offensive glass and finishing that one in impressive fashion You know then that was right over our our our friend from Moscow Diuk whose father is here from Moscow Oh Donaldson absorbs a little bit of contact and Hines finishes I like that about Donaldson Right Right Like he excuse me Hines rather Uh at 64 190 lbs You had a number of these players and I dont care if it was uh Oreo or Hines or Jackson theyre fearless They they they they practice uh and teach toughness and thats the way these guys play Again Henderson with a second offensive rebound Give him five now uh for the game So again trying to get those rebounds numbers up so coach Lucas wont get on him at the end of the game Washington slips through his hands The Ichuk saves it Orio across the timeline 9356 Miami Orio found away Hung in the air Great body control Absorbing the contact but couldnt stick the landing Hell head to the free throw line 22 points so far for Cameron Oriel I think about the only drama left in this one is whether Donaldson will get his fifth in and nationleading double double of points and assist Hes sitting on nine dimes right now So I wonder if coach uh coach Jay Lucas will leave him out there long enough to try to get that 10th dime and push that uh national advantage up one of the players there for uh Miami having fun with none of the officials going after the break These officials they they probably were going to have to hydrate after this game This has been a fastpaced basketball game for these guys Up and down weve gone tonight True Washington pounds the rock Malibitz in the corner Great look from Renu Altunes cant finish Thats one of the few times weve seen Altunis not finish down low Hes been so good uh in that painted area all night long using his length really well Great point That was his first miss Hes got eight points on four or five shooting Woo This guys made a lot of shots tonight and tough ones at that Give Cam Oral 26 points after another tray Six of nine from deep Yeah he had 29 earlier in the season and season high 29 and with with 345 left to play in this one He might break his season high here and careerhigh should say Renu from the elbow puts it on the deck He punishes other power forwards and did so right there Well head to break and we will also see two free throws when we come back music 336 left Not playoffs like let the kids go out there on the field and decide whos going to be the national championship rather than some writers you know sitting in a room talking about and casting casting votes I want the players to go and the coaching staff to go out there and decide it on the field And how good is it for the alumni base right You cant you cant you know even buy that type of emotion in any way of life when youre out there supporting your alma mater there They pull off that big victory Who was the kid that got the interception in the end zone Bryce Fitzgerald What a play A nice play Was that Oreo again for another triple 29 points for that young man I tell you what that makes the bus ride back up to Jacksonville a little nicer doesnt it Hes Orio not Oreo But if he wasnt Oreo hed be double stuff man That guys got what is he got 29 now Yeah Yeah 20 29 points and hes made it look easy in both halves of basketball In fact I dont know if hes going to be on the bus Coach Kenned said he was only going to have one guy riding back up the road with him on the bus afterwards I gave one of my books and say Hey you you can read you can read about Williams on on the way back up the road What What highways he got to take Hey through the fire By the way the books on Amazon if youre not if youre if youre not done Christmas shopping yet And Scott is not done So no I I I know like everybody in Scotts life looks forward to getting a book Thats exactly right Ill even autograph it too Send it out there Might not get it before Christmas cuz I dont want to pay the extra postage Awesome book by the way Well done my man Thank you Free throw for Washington is good This is a guy who coach Lucas loves and hes a defensive menace We havent said his name too many times tonight And and hes versatile Hes a jack of all trades Coach Lucas says This is my wild card right here Yeah we we talked about a little bit We may had some fun about the 14 siblings but you know you going to make its going to make you tough right When you got 14 brothers and sisters and we talked about the fast hands two and a half uh steals per per game which is uh first in the ACC by the way and 15th nationally So kid gets it done defensively He is buying what coach Lucas is selling on the defensive side of the ball Heres Donaldson batting with Oral who has made a career best seven threes tonight High arcing three This time it was Kent Jackson who attempted it Hes off the mark Here come the Hurricanes Altutis from behind He was almost rejected but the sheer power enables him to finish Yeah Was that Donaldson on the assist there Was that the one that get put him over the mark there It wasnt Donaldson on the assist but he happy for this young man right here And you mentioned the fact that he had only missed one shot inside But when youre getting clobbered like that and you have to fight through that contact and then still get the ball Thats how you used to defend Shaq Oh no I would have stopped I would have stopped Shaq I would have fouled him on catch and told him Hey just leave just leave my teeth in my mouth cuz I want to have a nice steak dinner at the end of the game He always say Scott I always liked you All right no problem I always liked you Jack when he was 16 years old visited North Carolina when Pete Chil cut and I took him around showed him a good time So yeah he always remembered that in the league He never hurt me out there on the floor Well he did go to LSU so he couldnt have that much fun Well listen we were we I want I dont want to say this is before NIL but I can guarantee you uh Coach Coach Brown was it Coach Brown down there Coach Brown down there wasnt giving Shaq uh you know the 35 bucks postgame meal that we were getting at Carolina laughter Trey Caddy off the window for two A Marian Ohio native has been hot coming into this one and has played well tonight Six points Dove from the corner draws iron Altunis cant finish again but well go back to the free throw line But on the offensive glass and like I say the reason why youre you know on that that uh bench press and and leg press and youre pushing that sled around in the weight room is so when you get those offensive rebounds you can go back up with power and finish overhand See so many young players they get this and then want to try to go up off glass Im happy even though he missed that youre able to fight through that contact And officials again when you play with power theyre going to reward you with a whistle Oh close the door Well it must have gotten shaken up there because that one wouldnt be good if uh may have hit Coconut Grove I guess 610 274 Lets see if the big fella can get it right this time Well hes doing great when he gets the ball down in the in the paint Susa say something nice about the young man The free throws are a work in progress Hes playing awesome There you go Five and six 10 points Who am I to judge anybody Well they were I think the I think the fans wanted that one cuz theyre theyre sitting on 99 points right now Its always a big deal especially the young the young players that they had in the half They had the kids running around at halftime playing a little five on five uh in their in their uni So they you know they want to see that that scoreboard go to 100 here this afternoon Again like I said this is this will be the fourth time now uh in the in the first time since 1988 the Canes have scored over 100 points three times in one season So a chance to make that uh four times this bucket Oh the boy says Oh boy I got it Give him 102 officially They have surpassed that mark Scott its an impressive group of of uh of players that u coach Lucas and his staff have got here right So doing the job defensively They held them under 30 shooting in the first half Im not sure exactly where theyre sitting right now Thats a big metric for uh Coach Lucass team right They they want to keep him out of the paint They want to try to try to keep well they didnt keep him under six free throws uh six six threepoint shots what he wants to do but hes done a good job making sure that theyre not getting a whole lot of second chance opportunities off of those threepoint shots was that threeo his fourth of the night fourth three of the night you know and thats a good thing right as you got a number of different guys youre going into this break and Im not sure you know coach Lucas will have his team back after the holiday They dont play again till the 30th when they got uh Pittsburgh rolling in here Ill be doing that game by the way Um everybody feels good like theyre contributing to this 11 win start to this this season and those types of good feelings become infectious amongst the group and everybody wants to keep working hard for one another you dont start to splinter and guys get in little factions whether you know Ill get mine Ill help you get yours and well forget about the rest of the team and that happens on teams that will only win seven games thus theres not a whole lot of guys back here from last year Thompson with the basketball just into the game great story he earned a scholarship on December 4th did as the miss from Caddy fast breaking of the Hurricanes plumber with the rebound down Under 30 seconds left Caddy is hammered Dont go to the free throw line but the Ospreys still playing 150 And aint that good to see right Like we talked about this team wouldnt split They talked about togetherness They talked about toughness and uh trusting one another And I I mentioned this the first half Youre going to see a full 40 minutes out of this basketball club But yeah now lets down by 40 and nobody wants to get beat by 40 But you its every opportunity when youre playing against squats like Miami like Tennessee like Gonzaga uh Florida its opportunities to get to get better And when they play in the AON this will serve them well Miami had 105 four points excuse me against ulm Today they got 105 inside of 20 seconds Well Coach Kennan has got a very good recruiting class He told me to let everybody knows hes got three young stud players coming in And if he can keep these guys motivated and like I say playing together and playing with this type of toughness all the way through March hes going to be okay and coach Lucas
