especially proud of the way he has adjusted to now being at the top of Team scouting reports alongside his teammate Blake Henson Panthers win the tip theyre in the home whites today for their final nonconference game of this 2324 campaign right down low guo Diaz Graham making his second start of the season its so great set to come out and get a layup to start the game get the lid off the basket Mast it on have used the same starting five all year their big Eric Moulder at 68 the tallest guy in the starting lineup for PFW he grabs the rebound here tries to put back but that pit height is going to be a problem today for PFW Julius yes it will be playing against the trees guys 611 and better cant scare you from going in there anyway this is the second straight game that this has been the starting five for the Panthers William jeffr and G Mo Diaz Graham new to the lineup Saturday against South Carolina State Panthers getting offensive Board second chance jeffris top of the key off Target and a rebound to the Music mastadons I think thats one Fort Wayne to settle with not Jeffer strong suit got to live with something rashed Bellow number zero lead score for the dawns Panthers get a takeway Carrington transition athletic move to the Applause bucket so a quick four nothing lead for the Applause Panthers now Jaylen Jackson and back to Bellow on the wing defended by leg timers at 8 seconds offt Target from the free throw line rebound to Diaz gaham like the shot by Bellow even though he missed it change of pace change of Direction and Leed had his heels on the sideline off the catch this is whys threetime ACC rookie of the week JP yeah nice defense get it in transition pushing the timle and get there late Applause gently buckets inside the paint not necessarily something Carrington has done too too much of this year he can shoot the three pretty well he likes that midrange jump shot a lot with that length he can get it up and over anybody in the country and shuffling of the feet from Rasheed Bellow Jeff Cs proud of the way his Panthers have performed over the last few games three game winning streak and an eight and3 record on the year of course coming off last season capable was named ACC coach of the year in the Panthers first NCAA tournament trip since 2016 Julius whats it going to take for them to get back there this year you know the same formula it always starts on defense but you know playing as a team I think his team is definitely playing unselfish basketball they have a leader that guy right there blank Henson so as long as he continue to lead and play unselfish I think this team can go a long way stretch earlier this season Panthers dropped three of four games and cable said he learned that this team is resilient dropped a couple tough ones at home to Missouri and Clemson but then going on the road at West Virginia and getting a big win there by 17 in morgant town when he felt the team kind of got back on track and they havent lost since cookies from Diaz Graham now Carrington pull up triple off Target and Roberts on the Applause board Brinton Morton Robertson in the corner the 58 guard for Fort Wayne caught traveling already 5 turnovers early in the contest against the dawns had a great conversation with John Kaufman in his 10th season at Purdue Fort Wayne ended up in Fort Wayne Indiana in part because of Ohio State head coach Chris Holman the two knew each other from the mid 2000s Holman was an assistant at Garder web when Kaufman was an assistant coach at stene when the assistant coach position opened at Purdue Fort Wayne Colman had a good relationship with Tony jassic who had just gotten the job and he said hey I got a guy for you and John Kaufman Kaufman became the head coach three years later and now his 10th year at Purdue Fort Applause Wayne hasnt made a trip to the NCAA tournament yet but off to their best start in the history of their program in the division one era for the dawns Panthers providing pressure once again a prayer from Morton Robertson is offt Target and a weak side rebound for Ley the da still scoreless 5 minutes in here Le gets tied up and the foul is called against Jaylen Jackson so Panthers with an early six nothing lead tremendous job defensively by the blue and Music gold now the mastadons mentioned coming in at 11 and one their net ranking currently sits at 80 a 20 start to their play in The Horizon league and its their best start as a D1 program Julius theyve got a lot of different pieces that could make them dangerous in League Play this year in Horizon yeah you know they got to be Scrappy they got to win the games obviously coach talked about you know getting used of winning and which wouldnt being a culture not necessarily trying to schedule as many power five conferences as possible but you know winning games so you know they just got to continue to play hard theyre going to go into a lot of these games under size and trying to figure it out lost all their starters from last years team but replaced them really effectively John Kaufman said hes not surprised at the way his team has started this season but the Panthers off to an excellent start tonight leading 8 nothing guo Diaz Graham making an impact back during his time as a starter in two games so far hes got four points on two of two shooting so far now here is Carrington threetime ACC rookie of the week feeds to Hinson who has it Stripped Away but last touched by the Music dawns for a big man Diaz gr is just scale long hes going to be a very good player only in his second year continue to get better and better better stronger and Applause stronger Jeff cable said the lineup change in part because of the way gu mod Diaz Graham and jeffris have been playing and wants to see more out of feder Rico Federico and Zach Austin as well Jaylen low from the wing he was knocked down but no foul called and the dawns come up with it trailing by eight still no points on the board for Fort Wing and a FAL called against jayen low down in the short corner I think the lineup Chang is a good thing you know shake it up let let guys know that hey you got to continue to compete and produce in order to you know stay in a rotation that way you know and it shows the depth that they have you know that they still have you know Jeff is a guy whos been here and was out during you know for injury but you know hes hes a guy that can get the job done for me I can just insert him right into that lineup and hell get it done C said get after each other in competition its been really really good and helps everyone to stay sharp when you know youve got guys on the bench fighting for your spot in the starting Music five re ball too strong there from Maximus Nelson jayen low in transition and hell reset uses the screen from Hinson drives with the left hand nearly got it to go rebound feder Rico now hints in deep three ball too strong Panthers Tracked Down the board once again already five offensive rebounds on the night for Pittsburgh I think everybody in the gym just wanted feder Rico to go ahead and lay that one up now caring te back to federo had it slapped away and Nelson comes up with it for the dawns and to your point JP I think everyone wanted him to shoot that ball and thats what coach capable wants to see a little more aggression on the interior from feder Rico yeah he works hard down there rebounding you know in the offense and defensive end when you get it that close you got to take the chances with while you have it know the guyss like to dominate the ball all the time thats your golden opportunity to be selfish Music yeah well Jeff cell said you know majority of their scoring comes from their guards along the perimeter wants to see somebody step up as a post threat yo Diaz Graham and feder Rico both trying to do that make an impression provide some interior scoring definitely going to need to get some bunnies some easier shots around the basket dont want to rely on jump shot you know all the time so between throwing it in there to somebody big or leg it creating up the dribble theyre going to need it hon off Target again but Panthers trying to get another offensive rebound Scramble for it won by the dawns mentioned five offensive boards for pit but only two second chance points struggling to convert on those extra Applause opportunities Horton Robertson goes Baseline federo stops him and hes out of Applause Play Its like three times they stepped on the line not being aware where they are on the basketball court got to take care of the basketball and not turn it over so JP at I think you see the impact of this Fort Wayne pressure a little bit Panthers are one of their last seven from the field yeah they Scrappy they help each other you know on his screen for example hes here hes not just backing off offensive rebound again for Pittsburgh after the low penetration now 13 on the shop clock low again feed to Federico in the Applause flushed thats a nice dish from The Freshman yes sir Jackson tried to reverse layup well defended by Pittsburgh Jaylen low pushing the tempo again this time up to Music Austin hon pops off the screen takes the runner gets his own board but a shove keep it at Music 102 Panther defense showing up today and the Freshman with the feed to feder Rico Panthers up by eight Music Music early welcome back to Pittsburgh when we asked Purdue Fort Wayne head coach John Kaufman his concerns about pit he said theyre all going to be looking down at our guys we got to find a way to guard them and heres why Panthers with three players 611 or taller this is among players who have played at some point this season Purdue Fort Waynes tallest guy Eric Moulder at 68 theyve got a few guys at 68 but Moulder are the biggest contributor disparity look good on paper until a guy like Chevy Troutman or Dean Blair walks into the building and flip you over their shoulder and you realize that you still got to come out here and play the game as well this is the tallest pit basketball team since 034 when they had Aaron Greg Mark mccol Chris Taft and Tory Morris you remember those guys absolutely hope you didnt have to guard him that was a solid Squad especially with Chris T yeah CT from Brooklyn New York that team had four guys 6 10 or taller this pit team in 2324 the sixth tallest team in the country according to kenpom and heres one of the trees at the line here feder Rico Federico another way you can work your way onto the floor and earn more minutes is by converting at the line hes just 41 in that area coming into this game tonight but he knocks down the first definitely got to do better in that aspect Im sure he knows too strong on the second Panthers lead is at 114 a lot of good defense on both sides Purdue Fort Wayne is 22 from the field Panthers 33 on the night now a drive from Del tied up on the inside in a travel just struggling to find a rhythm right now nice hesitation move didnt know what to do with it shoot it already six turnovers tonight by the dawns yeah there a tree down there waiting for you he might have to shoot that pull up right there instead of driving all the way to the basket mention they have the best turnover margin in division one but being put to the test tonight already six turnovers by Purdue Fort Wayne and only three committed by the Panthers and when you have a size advantage thats what you do just go right inside see if they can defend five different Panthers on the score sheet and Im out the put back Jam from Eric Applause Boulder so took the energy out of the building for a moment there Moulder but still a sevenpoint panther lead as Carrington resets the offense guo on the pop triple in the air too strong leic goes up for the rebound and put back no good draws the foul hell head to the Applause line nice pass good finish by Diaz gaham but I dont know if it was better to screen right here that motor that motor set or is it the put back that was a silent screen well after seeing the replay I think Panther fans might want to foul he kind of shoved away Diaz Graham to the floor there in order to get the put back and hey maybe thats what you got to do when youre outmatched in the hike Department got to be physical get the guys to the floor right if the referees caught it all we wouldnt get through a game you know they say if youre not cheating youre not trying okay so if they dont catch you its legal gota do what you gotta do gotta do what you got to do good crew tonight by the way Ted Valentine Matt Potter Tony Applause chza leg it two for two from the line to make it 156 Panthers however two of their last 10 from the field heres Bellow driving against the seven footer Diaz Graham now a kick out Nelsons three is Off the Mark and the Panthers are going to Applause run Carrington looking for an opening had it Stripped Away Now Morton Robertson tries to settle out to Bellow three ball to strong once again a rebound to guo his fourth of the Applause night Bell trying to find a rhythm Carrington crosscourt Jorge from deep and a whistle by Ted Valentine near the Baseline looks like its going against the dawns before the threepoint shot by Jor and that is one hes going to want to erase from his memory so its a good thing the whistle was called before the shot from jge Diaz Grant William jeffr steps in for Jorge JP what do you like about the way Jeffers is played M I mean you know his defense is always topnotch I can appreciate a guy who puts in the work on that side of the court but you know hes just an unselfish he you know the best thing about him as he has one go off his hands right there he does what he does he doesnt do too much on offense he know know his job is to go out there and defend so he plays within himself so Jaylen Jackson with the takeaway and the bucket but ishmail Leed good response taking it to the glass you know I really believe that its going to come down to leg it get into the basket like that more often its going to determine how far and how good this pit team can be Applause nine on the timer for Fort Wayne heres the Lefty point guard Bellow trying to shake Carrington out to Jackson time running out on the shot clock the step through from Jackson was not soon enough shot clock violation called good defense by the Applause Panthers feel like it could have been a travel there also I think youre right but in todays game I just dont really know if I know travel with we well we were just talking pregame about James Harden and Trey young right yeah yeah you know those guys like to manipulate a lot of things they get away with the referees not going for it no more that is the right word for it manipulation at its Music Applause finest heres Hinson takes it to the bucket and scores his first made field goal of the night here at the 8minute Mark in the first Applause half leading score in the conference JP what do you think when its not going down with a jump shot you got to take it to the basket and get it done that way one you got to love the effort to not quit play D close out slide de feet and contest now the question someone on our crew raised earlier would he have gotten the block with just his hand or did the shoe enable the block to happen I think he might have got it with his fingertips not that way but he might have nicked it a little bit but you got to love the effort to not quit still putting the work with for your teammates coach said that they needed a stop right there that was in a you know at a major you know moment in in that game you got to love it well his coach John caufman is taking advantage of the situation said one of his season ticket holders was trying to buy the shoe that got the shoe block so he did a certificate of authenticity and there you have it he said its still on the market so if youre interested in the shoe that committed the shoe block there you go get in touch with head basketball coach at Purdue Fort Wayne John Kaufman I mean if were auctioning off these kind of things I got the stat sheet from Bob Carringtons triple double Night Part the only one as a freshman so hey get out me Applause so a 13point lead for the Panthers here going to pause for a moment bub Carrington with some blood on his left arm Jaylen low is going to enter for him temporarily as he gets bandaged up Panthers on a 60 run over the last 90 seconds starting to find a rhythm offensively theyve made their last three from the field Steel by Leed Hinson On The Run theres the lob nearly got the jam to go but tipped Away by the Applause dawns under seven minutes to go first half now a step back from Bellow the long arms of Guero Diaz Graham working on the close out now he runs the other way kick out to Jeff and jeffris cant get the runner to go and last touchdown of bounds off the Applause dawns so good Vision by ishma Leed but just couldnt get the Finish from his teammate Hinson yeah you see he didnt quite get control of it but he got up there nice unselfish play got a reward youre big if hes running the floor like that so Blake kinson of course known for his threepoint shooting ability has only taken two from Beyond The Arc today weve seen him in and around the basket offensively a little more than typically do Roberts in the corner Fort way still unable to convert these teams by the way a combined 0 for 17 so far from three in this game but guo Diaz Graham with the slam on the inside hes got six points in the Panthers have a 15point lead make that eight now for G mod Diaz gra Julius hes having a night in the first half nice eyes run the floor finish strong at The Rim Applause Panthers up 15 JP we werent sure who wed see starting at the five tonight whether itd be Federico or guo Diaz Graham but eight points on four of five shooting for the Spanish sophomore and hes showing why hes earned the job yeah hes very skilled and you know even gu out on the wing his versatility being able to defend the post block shots protect the rim slide his feet on the wing against smaller players yeah almost got another one there Panthers up by 13 under six minutes to go here first half guo Diaz Graham with eight of the 23 points on the night for bit and I think thats the big difference between him and feder Rico his offensive ability yo can also pop out and shoot the three every so often as well for these pit Panthers Roberts Baseline Drive reverse layup goes athletic drive from Anthony Roberts the fifth year Guard from Chicago to make the deficit now 11 Music Applause points good poke away there by Morton Rob now the 58 guard penetrating the other way throws it up thought there might have been a travel against Morton Robertson but now the kick out to Jackson three is Off the Mark Fort Wayne now 0 for nine from Beyond The Arc tonight heres a drive from leet through contact and they rule it a clean block Im not sure how JP what do you think it was solid good defense way to get her met him at The Rim nice reverse layup right there Drive Applause Baseline oh two of them might have got it I think so yeah its clean Play Good block by Fort Wayne keeps it at 2312 Panthers now one of their last seven from the field trying to nail down that Rhythm on offense the mod Diaz Graham draws the foul inside and well see if they call it on the shot or on the floor that would put the Panthers in the one and one just a little late sliding over and hes got his foot on the restricted area this worth a shot theres not much he can do against a a guy whos giving up you know hes given up so many inches hes a little height disadvantage there huh for sure try to take the charge get a little early you got it Panthers three for six from the line early ni that four for seven after the guo Diaz brand mate Jeff C said in practice when theyre doing free throws hes trying to turn the music up real loud simulate a crowd maybe throw a basketball at a guy anything to throw him off and give him a game like situation JP yeah nothing is going to simulate the game nothing is like the game the lights are brighter talked about it earlier in the year that this is the only area where the team wasnt really clicking or shooting free throw so just got to focus lock in Im Ive played on teams that was historically bad at shooting free throw so I have no advice for Coach cable if he finds the formula please give it to me well how about this after 19 attempts we finally have the first made threepointer of this basketball game courtesy of Maximus Nelson for Fort Wayne makes it 2415 and the astonishing thing about it JP is that these are two teams that rely on the three ball but tonight didnt see one until the 4 and a half minute Mark you think they might mentally already be on Christmas vacation just a little bit thats a factor mind both coaches talked about how tough that is keeping the focus before the holiday break heres G Mo strong drive to the bucket but cant Applause finish heres Bellow and a foul called on caring team ninepoint lead for the Panthers both teams trying to find some offense with 349 to go first half yeah hes very scared like I said before inside outside but right now hes attacking the basket showing that Im every bit of 61 7 ft tall and you cant do anything about it hes on the verge of his fourth double figure scoring game on the year after having just three in all of last season of course Panthers knew his role would grow this year and stepped into the starting lineup on Saturday started once again tonight and really rising to the occasion and has over doubled his scoring output last season compared to this year in points per game really proving to be a big factor on the inside for the Panthers who lead by nine as we reach the final stretch of the first Applause half and hes spending a lot more time on his feet than he did last year last year felt like he bet bit the dust every other play put on a little more weight y hes able to hold his own now well it was his moms cooking back in Spain Applause right for Fort Wayne its tough to come out of a break and get a shot clock violation yeah already nine turnovers tonight for Fort Wayne Carrington takes a step back thats off Target but the dawns had two players in the area they both touched it out of bounds Panthers can another opportunity got to live with that one caringtin is one for five from the field Jeff cable perhaps looking for answers as well just 24 points in the first 17 minutes tonight for pit low the kick out Austin the drive athletic take to the bucket Austin nice Up and Under he is super athletic yeah he can do that whenever he would like first bucket of the night for Austin great defense by pit on the other end Panther fans thought it was off the dawns but its called in favor of Fort Wayne and now they change the call as you see one more look at Zack Austins take he looked like he could have dunked that going Baseline still and I think thats the right call another look there you see the shock on Zack Austin face after the initial ruling they did change it back to give Panthers possession up 11 nice pass by hinston to the inside no threepointers yet by the Panthers still they are 0 for 10 from Beyond The Arc and JP I got to say if you tell Jeff cable that his teams going to be 0 for 10 from threepoint range for two minutes left in the first half but theyre up 11 I think he would take that hes going to take it all day Im sure Blake Hensons going to have something to do with the turnaround hes not a guy thats gunshot Im sure hes going to figure it out sooner or later he has made a threepointer in 24 consecutive games still waiting for that first one tonight Blake Hinson you think he knows about that streak I would say so what about you keep it going keep you know about your streaks of how many dunks in consecutive games you had I did not I felt like I was going to get won every game anyway Laughter so Panthers draw another foul on the inside you know he set those feet you can forget about it Austin putting the work Applause in Zach Austin transfer from High Point course a guy that was in the starting lineup at the start of the season they very high hopes for him did have 12 points Off the Bench Saturday against South Carolina state and a defensive asset as well has five games this year with multiple blocks for the Panthers so perhaps a little battle between him and will jeffris for a job in the starting lineup but Austin has contributed well Off the Bench the last couple nights its a blessing going to have two guys in Jeffers and Austin mod Diaz Graham also the leading rebounder for Pittsburgh now with six long alleyoop attempt there unsuccessful now Morton Robertson searching for something on the other end another mismatch Diaz Graham gets out on him but he makes it over top of the sevenfooter thats a 5 fo8 guard hard making the jump shot over the seven foot forward not phased at all heres leg it drive and kick Austin faked the three thought about it fires and hits first threepointer of theight for the Panthers belongs to Zack Austin hes up to seven points thats the way to be poised he drove the last time so they played off of him kevs composure set his feet Let it Fly makes it a 14point lead for the Panthers too strong on the threepoint attempt now about an 8sec difference between shot and game clock for Applause Pittsburgh ishma leet taking his time defended by Rasheed Billo now 10 on the timer screen comes up from Hinson Leed on the drive kick out Austin three in the air almost swirled in rebound to the dawns theyve got 8 seconds to go the other way Panthers get organized defensively Bellow the step back well defended by leged and it is a 14o Pittsburgh lead at the break two for 26 from threepoint range in the first half one for 13 on each side well see if they can find a rhythm a little bit more here not a good start for the dawns off the attempt from Bellow if Im Bellow Im trying to get to the basket you know I didnt have a a good the the ideal first half I dont want to come right out and shoot a jump shot let me get something go into the basket or get to the free throw line bell is the mastons leading scorer on the season but tonight hes one for six carington hits the midrange jumper for the first basket for the Panthers in the second Applause half B Carrington now two for six on the night with four points Bellow driving on Diaz Graham thats not going to work out well and Hinson grabs the loose ball for Music pit freshman Carrington setting his offense finds Hinson drive from Hinson and had it poked away on his way to the rim nice penetration good defense but to go back to Bellow you know when he gets it going yeah you got to put it on the floor you know Henson not settling for that three ball they know Scot report is going to say that in bold print he normally takes that one dont you think for sure all the time I think understanding that theyre going to close out to him a little harder and whos going to block his shot once he gets there yeah you know Im going in there hes not a little guy Carrington giving go with guo now the lefthanded Drive what a take from The Freshman Carrington to convert he got to give the Shacks there at the left hand after that yeah show it off right thats a nice move Martin Robertson hits the triple brings the lead back to 15 Carrington with the first two baskets of the Panthers second Applause half heres L working on Morton Robertson couldnt get it to go rebound grabbed in by Applause Moulder drive from Roberts Off the Mark rebound to Blake Hinson seven boards on the night for Hinson Carrington Diaz gr the fake the drive the runner gets it to go count the basket G Mo Diaz Graham with 11 on the night to lead the Panthers good job at finishing through the contact putting on the floor big boy yeah get it up reach in clear foul right there reaching in to try to knock it out hes really starting to excite some people the way hes played these last few Applause games got to hit the free ones though huh yes sir the energy that he plays with on be in this length you know its easier you dont have to you dont have to hedge when hes out there you can just switch the screen great defense Again by G mod Diz Graham tips it to Carrington smart play now above the pullup from the free throw line its good stopped on a dime and sunk the Applause Music Applause basket its a nice transition pull up good hands by Diaz ground love Carrington pushing in transition nobody want to stop the ball okay stop and pop we learned that back in seventh grade great start to the half for kington had just two points in the first half already six in the first three minutes of half number two good play by the dawns and a good penetration from The Freshman Cory Hadnot hes a threetime horizon League freshman of the week already had not with his first basket of the Night Fort Wayne got to get a stop got to start getting stops on this end crosscourt to jeffris pull up jumper not that time offensive board almost by Diaz Graham but out of bounds heres the take from The Freshman Guard from Atlanta yeah come off make the most of your minutes get to the basket you your team need a spark this is the best way pressure on that b get a layup or get to the line well if the mastadons are going to fight their way back they need to do so soon down by 17 early second Applause half Roberts driving on Jeff tried for the reverse lap gets it out to Bellow with eight to shoot hadn defended by Carrington brims out and hon hauls it in for the Panthers just two points for Blake Hinson tonight but eight rebounds to lead the team Carrington aant pass but Hinson able to track it down 11 on the timer Hinson the kick to guo the drive and the crafty shot and he draws the foul in the Applause process 17point Advantage for the Panthers guo Diaz Graham doing a little bit of everything tonight for the blue and gold struggled a little bit in the first half tonight but Julius hes finding his F here early second half they get to the basket with the left right there playing some defense transition is where hes at his best pushing up the floor have the composure eyes up all the time Tak it and make it hes had some really impressive performances early in his college career especially in his debut game against North Carolina AT got a triple double for these Panthers but you want to see him establish that level of consistency a little bit more now not asking for a triple double every night but you want to see his shooting efficiency and his ability to take care of the basketball on a steady level without a doubt you know hes a young guy but hes playing the most important position on the Florida point guard position and hes doing a great job at it so far you obviously the the competition is going to get a little stiffer as they enter conference play but I think he did a good job in nonconference really unique guy long 65 guard freshman from Baltimore Maryland an area that of course has produced so many tremendous guards over the years in college basketball and many that have advanced on to the professional level bub Carrington looking like he could be the next one tremendous impression left by the Freshman early in his time as a pit panther now a 19point lead for Applause Pittsburgh heres the 58 Morton Applause Robinson kicks over to Jackie Le it defends him and hinting chases down the rebound thats what you dont want to do is that rule number one when you get the rebound there and have to throw it back in dont do it on that end of the floor save it under your own back that is definitely in the 101 basketball 101 handbook he did get his ninth Rebound in the process but then turnover makes it a 4124 game Austin nice pass to Le down low good muscle by legy backs down the defender and gets the Applause Music Applause two what do you like about legga creating space there against the big guy yeah Leed is strong he is not intimidated by any big down there his composure around the basket you know this remind me a little bit of Tony Parker is finishing among the trees when youre undersized putting pressure on the bigs drawing Applause fouls hes going to need to be consistent doing that if pit want to be you know finished at the top of that ACC yeah three great Seasons at Rhode Island for legged and finding success has started every game this year for the Panthers has double figures in every game on the year looking to continue that streak tonight leg it with six points 14 minutes to go here at the beat nice entry pass to federo who draws the Applause contact the feder RICO give him a look like man throw that thing up in in here you see I got him sealed whats the hold up 3in height Advantage there for federo who is defended by Maximus Nelson and the Panthers take Music Applause advantage its the best reps the shooting free throws he going to get in the game yep and shoot him all you want to him practice nothing better than those two reps he got right there yep two for two for feder Rico brings the Panthers to 10 of 14 on the line tonight how about this JP Fort Wayne has not attempted a free throw in this game oh Nelson must have heard he said why shoot the free throws when I can shoot this three ball right here theyve got two of them in the second half after having just won in the entire first 20 minutes Austin jab step swings it crosscourt to leg it that one came over by us too much on the heave from The High Point transfer a little bit more this way right thought you were ready right I was Laughter Music ready you got an idea about that celebration there JP Im out of guesses on that these days you know please dont make me outdate myself I want to be hip but you know it it it keeps evolving hey if it helps Im right there with Im out of luck on that one I like it though I like the the energy and the personality at the that the kids bring to the table Yeah you can be serious and have fun at the same time but thats might be a little too much fun backto back turnovers out of control passes got to do better well you mentioned earlier right game before break yeah Jeff c will talk to us he prioritizes giving his guys a break over the holiday its tough to get one and he likes to do it when he can Panthers arent back in Action till December 30th at Syracuse but as you alluded to at the same time tough to keep focus when all your classmates and your peers are on break and youve got to play a basketball game on December 20th the atmosphere on campus isnt the same you already got a glass of eggnog in your hand you Pro eggot or anti by the way Im Pro yeah all right Im an eggnog fan I probably shouldnt be but you know you can still get up get up you say in my dreams I can still get up my you my me my mentality says I can still get up but my body is going to tell me a different story these Applause days Panthers are up by 16 they have 11 turnovers on the night same with Fort Wayne Corner triple there from Hadnot off back rim rebound hauled in by Applause Carrington no field goals in the last two and A2 minutes for the Panthers guo to Applause Carrington threepointer swirls out for the freshman and the rebound to Applause Roberts pull off triple Roberts Bullseye Fort Wayne cuts the lead now to 13 the mastadons gradually building their way back into this game and Jeff capable and the Panthers get a timeout 13 lead 1140 to go number of fans attending the Panthers final home game before the holiday break Pittsburgh back in action in The Pete next on January 2nd hosting North Carolina in JP that will be a huge game here in just a couple of weeks yes it will Panthers trying to find that consistency in their program again after making the tournament last Applause year of course Jeff capable reminded us they were one shot away from a share of the ACC regular season title in that game down in Coral Gables towards the end of the Applause season and if you want to be taken serious theres going to be home games against quality opponents that youre going to have to start winning North Carolina coming in here you got to protect your home court Applause drive from Jackson had it slapped Away by Austin now six to shoot for the Dos another great defensive play by Zack Applause Austin media timeout here at the 1044 Mark second half 15point lead for the pit Panthers here in the peak Music well Blake Henson is keeping the holiday spirit alive and well here in the Pete tonight take a look at the socks from the senior from Florida he is in the Christmas spirit and ready to go they got basketballs on him too snowflakes

many chances to bring out this tie and the socks that you got on change it up have some fun with it not to mention you got the nil thing going on yeah I can respect his creativity hes got some personality thats for Applause sure hon comes up with it here great drive but a better block from Anthony Roberts now the dawns in transition the other way feed to Moulder Austin the takeaway last off Fort Wayne well defended by Zack Austin nice transition push it but Robert said get that out of here but the flex afterwards though I dont know sir I know what you thinking doing that down 15 its coming across like Jordan p and kma throwing a o down 20 let me tell you something you never want to be compared to Jordan P especially not in December 2023 Blake Henson gets the n one hell head to the line just four points today for Hinson hes had double figures every game this year so well see if he can get there but he puts the Panthers up 17 right Applause now too little I mean thats all day long we call that posterio right there I dont think Ive heard that one before I like that poal PO seral any time makes an 18point Panther lead their largest lead was 21 just about 5 minutes ago in this second half they were up 4524 pass it on on a scoring drought now of over two minutes Jackson driving on carring te somehow got the angle for that one to fall nice penetration good finish heres carington knocked to the floor by Bellow foul called on the junior guard didnt like the call but that will be the first of the game for Applause Bell might have just lost his footing right there yeah if youre rashed Bellow may be wondering what can I do Carringtons a quick guard and that time hes the one that gets called for an offb foul so possession goes back to the dawns yeah Bells going to have to start trying to force the issue right here see if you can find you a rhythm if for nothing just to you know close it out strong most efficient masted on tonight has been Jaylen Jackson 10 points five of nine from the field rest of Team struggling to find a rhythm theyre 33 from the floor as a group Roberts left open for three not that time rebound tipped to Austin for the Applause Panthers hinen looking for his first three of the night cant get it there rebound secured by Applause Moulder drive from Jackson Moulder left open on the low block and hes Applause F so Julius certainly hasnt been the prettiest performance tonight from the Panthers but they are up by 16 so what do you take from that the fact that they are one for 16 from threepoint range but still hold a double legit lead you know they dont look pressed you know to to keep shooting a three I think theyre theyre doing a good job at taking what the what Fort Wayne is giv them and theyre just winning this game defensively I dont know if its because Fort Wayne dont seem to be able to um find a rhythm offensively I dont I dont know if thats just because theyre having an off night or you give the credit to the the Panthers for you know their defense but you know defensively sometimes you you have to learn how to win these ugly games yeah thats part of the journey every team in the country not always going to be pretty just got to find a way as the Mastadon is going to provide some fullcourt pressure here against the Freshman backup point guard Jaylen low Diaz Graham All the Way Cross cour to Austin drives draws the foul count the bucket Zack Applause Music Austin and thats a great foul because if he didnt fou him right here he was going to take flight impressive adjustment to midair to draw the contact go underneath and hit the reverse great body Applause control but to go back to your point about you know winning the ugly games you know Zoo not being here definitely makes the atmosphere a little different and maybe you know the team just dont feel it the way that they they typically feel it thats a different field no doubt students at pit of course on their holiday break first semester over finals week was last Applause week expect a big crowd however for that one on January 2nd despite the fact that a lot of students still on break when North Carolina comes to town Panther fans come to the peak better believe it leg gets the takeaway has a move nice drive from legot but couldnt convert gets his own rebound bodies the defender and blocked again that time by De Renee for Fort Music Wayne 19point Pitsburg lead Blake kinson Julius Paige sure but inspiration is everywhere if youre listening ignite your imagination Music Audible Music back in Pittsburgh mentioned the Panthers are getting it done in different ways tonight they are the best threepoint shooting team in the ACC on the season but only one made three tonight they are one for 16 from Beyond The Arc yet JP they still have a 19point lead you know get it out of your system now but you know Blake H Henson specifically finding other ways to impact the game having rebounds you know its not a you know a huge deal at least he didnt you know pack it all the way up and just because he wasnt knocking the shots down decide not to contribute in other ways well Jeff capable has talked so much this year about his leadership how Blake Henson has found his voice and thats been a huge factor in the Panthers early season success is Blake Hinson taking the rign after the losses of jamarius Burton Nelly Cummings Greg Elliott Nike Sandy last year they needed a new voice and Blake Hinson has been Music that thats a lot of leadership to take over they those four guys they got it done last year cable said he loves it because its authentically him its authentically Blake and he has the utmost respect of everyone on the team he is that guy that gives everyone strength what a play here Austin to carington the driveing the dunk from the Freshman oh a rim rocker from Applause Carrington nice ball movement nice penetration and a strong finish by the young fella show you got some hops too you got the hand or you can pass the basketball now he shows that little stare you know what youre exactly right because out of all the things weve seen from him this year thats something we havent really seen him do yet yeah hes showing that he can take flight a little bit yep displaying another aspect of his impressive game the youngest player in the ACC bu Carrington what a play there from the freshman and maybe the prettiest play weve seen all night low the runner Off the Mark Diaz Graham tipped it back outside too much contact that time from Applause Music Applause Music Carrington he got nice yes it must be nice hey you could do that yeah I could there was a point in time long long long time ago youre still taking pictures with fans here I was here at halftime I witnessed Applause you yeah Im still its just nice to be able to play the game at the pace these young fellas are able to play the game and then wake up tomorrow without feeling like they just was hit by a truck basically cuz thats what I would feel like after a full game like I was going to say are you implying that you know I feeling yeah absolutely I couldnt give them a half of basketball right now its not that Im not in shape its just that this kind of abuse on the body at my age I just couldnt do it its amazing you go from being able to do it to it just being amazing that they can pull it off Ill pull out your old clips after the game Ill remind you and Ill be sore after watching nice jab step from Ley he fires and hits from the corner the second Panther three of the night and they now have their largest lead of the game at 22 Applause points look like a little hesitation shoot it in Rhythm Bellow jayen low using his quickness Austin the put back Jam excellent put back but that was a creative way to try to get that layup to go in Applause low he got in there look at the creativity oo I think the layup would have been better than a put back done you were talking pregame you see so much John Lucas in him huh a whole lot the way he keep his dribble alive in traffic his little floater game his fearlessness you know John Lucas was a competitor you know I think a lot of people forget he was player of the year the conference that he played in a big reason why they went deep into the tournament even beat the team that I played on in the sweet 16 so much respect to Applause him Jaylen low certainly a guy seems to be getting more and more comfortable in time here early in his Panther career Jeff cable said we definitely need him very different player from bub Carrington but very effective coming off the bench Le it crosscourt Austin fak the pass now the drive contact no call and now theres a whistle and it will go against the Music mastadons and if the word on the street about the LC his workouts over the summer is true loow is going to come back a much better player next year you can believe it hes already started to improve over his last three games jayen low eight assists and just one turnover early in the season was a little bit sped up by the college game some high quality opponents earlier in the year for this Panther team but really starting to become more comfortable also seven for 15 from the field across those last three for Jaylen low another three ball goes for Purdue Fort Wayne still a 19 Point Panther Applause Advantage I can appreciate the unselfishness by Bellow kicking it out for the three but I want him to take that pullup jump shot and find the Rhythm so bad Rasheed Bellow averaging 15 a game on the year eight points tonight on three of 10 shooting for Fort Wayne heres Hadnot pushing Tempo other way jayen low defending it and Roberts cant convert rebound ta to Austin Austin pull up jumper twoo strong rebound to Applause Nelson Applause 320 to go second half jayen low slowing things down for the Panthers seem to be well on their way to their fourth consecutive win ishmail Leed fires and misses from the wing but Jorge nice feed down low to Leed who tried to back down the defender but he shuffled his feet and it will take us to our final media timeout here in Pittsburgh 19point lead for the Panthers going into the holiday break well Panthers just over three minutes away from their fourth straight Victory and heres whats next some tough games right after the holiday break Jeff cable said most of his guys will go home tomorrow spend the holiday with their families and be back on the 26th and two ranked opponents in the next five games and of course Syracuse always a tough one as well JP yeah its about to get real really quick and hopefully you know theyre going to be prepared mentally when they get back that practice is going to be tough on the 26 boy I tell you yeah it sure is got to get that Focus back theyre on the road at Syracuse on the 30th and then theyll host the orange here on January 16th inside the peak Panthers going a little Zone to change it Applause up might be something they need to use in the Applause future so Julius panthers look like theyll improve to nine and three here and what do you take from this performance now on a 4 game winning streak heading into ACC play you know that this team can get it done in more ways than just shooting threes you know I think they rely on Blake Henson and knock that down bub to come off that pick and row and fine guys but sometimes you have to win the ugly games and defensively stay locked in so they did a good job doing that you know again this you know this team came in 11 and one you dont just win 11 games at a division one level being the scrub yeah you know they didnt play their best game either but hey you cant you have to you know play well against the teams thats in front of you Applause Panthers of course started the year 40 and then had a tough stretch where they faced five consecutive power conference opponents won two of those games defeating Oregon State in Brooklyn and mentioned the 17point win in Morgantown over West Virginia and that was the game that started the winning streak which is now going to extend itself to four games and JP certainly going to be weird to see the Panthers going to Syracuse to face a team thats not coached by Jim beheim its unbelievable I asked you if they were still playing a 23 its just such a staple the mention Syracuse and not see a two3 zone is going to be years of that Applause huh 19point lead for the Panthers minute 39 left to go some really good action around the country tonight as well as Baylor and Duke are tied late in the second half just about 6 minutes to go in that one and then I dont know about you but 900 pm UNC Oklahoma in a top 15 matchup sounds good to me when when we get out of here I cant believe Im going to say it but go duke you know Im rooting for the anytime the ACC team is playing out of conference Im rooting for them to win now the reputation of the ACC its a popular topic of conversation these days and if a team like Duke can beete Baylor thats a huge win for net rankings and metrics and NCAA tournament resumes late in the year of course the Blue Devils will be playing here in the peak on January 9th so I think youre absolutely right its good for the conference anytime you can battle with a top 10 team like the Baylor Music Bears and good for your resume if you happen to knock them off way to move the basketball nice finish with the left well Jeff capable should be happy to see a little more balance scoring tonight too Julius of course last few games Blake Hinson has been the guy getting those 20 plus outings but tonight three guys in double figures guo with 13 Zack Austin with 12 bub Carrington with 12 so good to see some other guys step up to the occasion and as you mentioned Hinson still impacting the game with those 10 rebounds yeah not forcing the issue what kind of shows the kind of person that he is and later he is usually a guy will come out here and still continue to keep the hot streak but Blake doesnt look you know pressed at all and his teammates going to have to support him it will be the first time this season that Blake Hinson does not score double figures Five Points on two of 10 shooting on the night for hining but the Panthers going to come away with the most important stat which is a w in their fourth in a row and cant ask for much more heading into the thick of the ACC schedule course took on Clemson back in early December for their first conference game and this is their last non League game tonight so its all ACC play the rest of the Applause way and this easier said and done you know sometimes guys would rather get their numbers and lose than not have their numbers and win so it says a lot about a guy who look to still be engaged and cheering his team on even though he didnt get you know his typical good numbers if you will so 6248 the final score in Pittsburgh as the
