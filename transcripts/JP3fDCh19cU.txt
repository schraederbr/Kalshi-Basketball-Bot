has a complete compliment with this team and hes excited about their future even throughout this year Duke coming in looking for their 20th win of the season and they win the opening tip I can have Syracuse 7755 in front of 31 000 on Saturday in the dome really took the crowd out of it quickly looking for a quick strike but a misfiring close there by Roach we had a good game he had 17 in that contest unless for Louisville theyre trying to get on the board first and they will getting another Lane to JJ trainer the 6A Junior thats a great start for the cards Kenny Payne talked to us earlier today about how important it was to get off to a good start and handle the basketball and the pressure from the Blue Devil is not turning it over Applause theyre going to knock it away from him stolen away by Jalen Withers he has it on the way Louisville had four and 23 but proving on a given day anyone is vulnerable they upset Clemson on Saturday 8373 invisible team is playing better and thats a blocked shot by Mitchell getting out doing the job defensively and not allowing white Jason really to get that three off nice effort by Mitchell Applause were just looking for someone inside thats going to be Lively and hes going to draw the foul Derek Lively The 71 Freshman a good game against Syracuse and blocked three more shots and hes proving to be one of the best shot blockers in the country he absolutely is second in the ACC and blocked shots you get a chance to look at Duke starting five and of course they havent had a complete starting five all season long but now starting to develop some continuity with this group talked about philipowski a moment ago seven foot freshman just locked down yet another ACC rookie of the week its the eighth time this season that he has taken that on her home so pretty good bet where its going to go youve got to step out of that limb Im stepping out way on the limb and say Kyle will be the Rookie of the Year yeah thats a pretty strong he might want to call that a branch thats how I roll right there safe as it gets off the back Iron by with his good threepoint man at about 44 percent trainer denied the paint by philipowski the drive flip open in nice move by L Ellis averaging 18 a game coming in and Ellis name ACC coplayer of the week this week Sharon get honored with dartel Joyner from NC State and these two guards have been playing great basketball over the last few games the last three specifically for L Ellis you had NC State yesterday on a Sunday just running by North Carolina on the spin Mitchell the window that came off empty hes got L Ellis is it Durham North Carolina native that one rattled in from threepoint territory nice to be home its great for him to behold he had 18 in this game a year ago and he is excited about playing in front of his friends and family we ask anything hes got to turn him down a little bit because hes home to calm their motions theres the slab by a lot they love that play going to Lively the big he can get up and over that iron higher than anybody but the value is really in the pass so you got a seven footer throw into a seven footer attacking off the bound to find against freshman teammate wheeler is going to turn around for the foul line thatll roll off the iron Proctor wants to push it Duke holding opponents to just 64 points a game they have been outstanding defensively all season long up to set a screen heres Proctor got a shot clock down to 10 Duke is 13 for 26 from three theyre going to go downstairs for the slam filipowski rising up high he can do that too averaging 15 points nine rebounds a game Applause Ellis gives it up to trainer Louisville season started with a ninegame losing skid they won a couple of games then they probably lost 10 in a row but theyre playing pretty well coming in heres trainer off the back of that iron trapped to lead the charge got a squeeze in there but couldnt get it to go great job by the cards getting back defensively man way downtown will sank that one hes the only Louisville Cardinal technically in double figures for the year and L Ellis excited about his opportunity to come home imploring his bench and making sure all of his guys are on board with his level of enthusiasm playing at Cameron Indoor stepping in the lane Mitchell with the Finish but to back up on Ellis there arent many players in the ACC as hot as he is right now for this particular stretch you know like over the last three four five games hes really shooting it well he absolutely is hes playing great basketball John Shire told us before the game that no one has more value to their team than does l Ellis Andrea Carter is going to talk to us about that when we come back from the break but Al is looking to add to his head there he goes against out another three ball so by the time Andrea gets to talk about L he may already be in double figure well hes coming off 28 against Clemson and the last three games hes getting over 27 points a game 33point game and a loss to Miami Louisville really off to a great start for them roach with a Fall Away rebound comes to Ellis he wants to push the tempo Duke getting back defensively trainer went to make a move and thats a travel OB weve had some excitement early in this weve got seven Footers sharing the basketball big on big crime here for the Blue Devils multiple times as philipowski gets the dunk but the way you combat that l in Spanish is B and this time is D3 last season there were seven double figure scores four for Duke and three for Louisville and the only one of those seven that remains is Ella Ellis he is a Durham native he is the Louisville point guard I talked to him and shoot around today he said anytime he plays a school from his home state of North Carolina he plays with a chip on his shoulder Corey mentioned he had 18 in this matchup last season that was off of the bench his role has changed he is the point guard now Cory you also mentioned managing his emotions what else is important for LLS to have success today managing his turnovers that has been the the really the issue that lls has had this season but since the calendar year turned to 2023 he actually has a positive plus 24 sister turnover ratio and so therefore he is developing as that point guard that leader that Kenny Payne needs for this team to be successful So to that point every single time as Lively gets a dunk inside every time Ellis plays against the team for North Carolina he has a chip on his shoulder thats a bag of chips now thats a bag of chips especially in this league yeah when you consider there four teams and you may play a couple of them twice so yeah that gives L as you said so eloquently my friend a bag of chips a big bag of chips youre carrying around outside for trainer Obi thats the guy that helps Louisville 16 points for JJ trainer in the win over Clemson which was a career high but he also has nine rebounds and three block shots in that game and when you look at JJ Trader at that fourth position he can stress the tour open up a lot of opportunities on the spin left the basketball on the deck and it scooped up by the bill Applause Music defensively hes had all sorts of problems this year but they could score when they get rolling and that ones going to drop down by Curry and one of the areas Global has improved now out to their largest lead nine points in this game they have gotten so much better this season has had the Blue Devils thats one of the things with the ACC the teams get better throughout the year because they play against each of those different styles which allows them to be able to develop his team finally will draw the foul hell be going to line 12 55 to go here first down I agree with that we saw Duke Dickey B and I just rolled past Syracuse on Saturday I thought that was the best the Duke looked all season long and you also had saw Duke get blown away at Miami two weeks ago and youre talking about a team that has taken that lesson and become a better team because of it Applause SEC Big Ten super Tuesday doubleheader seven Eastern number 11 Tennessee taking on Texas A M and then number 17 Indiana squares off against Michigan State Sony ESPN and the app as we get closer and closer to selection today Lively playing really good basketball here he absolutely is and thats part of that Improvement brother was saying you think about the fact that Derek gladly started this season he slowly integrated himself into the lineup now as a starter has become the REM protection and the anchor defensively that the Blue Bell would be but when you have Ryan young to come off the bench to add that level of experience it only makes it seem better so its likely had that eight block game against North Carolina Applause caught underneath pitcher defending got the shot up there anyway it almost went down they had to whistle the other way 12 30 to go in the half against Louisville will go against Curry first year at the half of the Cardinals told us today at their practice absolutely critical the Cardinals get off to a good start get down by a bunch early and they have done that they have really followed their coaches eating and he was he was tough one of those guys and shoot around today they came in with a little lackadaisical attitude he wanted to make sure they were locked in had his guys running lines and shoot around you dont see that happen in college basketball Proctor lines up a long line and down it goes the freshman hes only making about 29 percent from the threepoint line but he can be a confident shooter from out there Australia from Indianapolis Curry going up against young and yes its a walk he traveled with it Duke has tightened it up here but Louisvilles still on top 18 to 14 in the first half exclusive presentation of college basketball is brought to you by Wendys two for six dollars the best deal in fast food agner parnett as well as our guy everyone loves Deborah nervous purpose and one of the reasons he was a great great player the nickname absolutely one of the great nicknames in college basketball scores Applause still may be the mayor of Moore hes so popular in Louisville has a huge party during the Derby and again hes well known for his attributions and Granderson knocked down the three to make this a onepoint game University of Illinois Applause heres Mitchell on the loose Mitchell went for the dunk and he gets fouled on the play hell be up to shoot two were just like that a game that was a ninepoint lead for the cars now now opportunity for the Blue Devils to take a lead and Duke going to defensively getting out we talked to John Shire about who wanted to step up and guard LL as well Ellis got going early you see Tyrese Proctor now stepping up taking on that challenge forcing the turnover coach about the fact that you know Tyrese has grown not only as a point guard where hes playing that new role but also or so as a Defender good passer and eight assists against Georgia Tech seven against Virginia Tech another one coming here for Mitchell fouled by James going for the dunk and well roll that in nice touch and thats a 10nothing run as duke has jumped in front then talked about how it feels pain had his guys running lines and threw out a day and he talked about his importance to them to win the day to win that win the shoot around win the first four minutes of this game which they did however theyve lost the last few because the Blue Devils are on their heels now rolling off the Iron by James The Freshman 1019 to go in the half and once again you can feel that turn in Dukes favor we saw this on Saturday inside the Dome at Syracuse didnt know the 31 thousand they were ready to lose their minds Duke took them right out of the game they went on a couple of those patented Blue Devil runs and after maturity was a good team when you win against hostile crowds on the road that is showing the episode Mitchell working one foot in the pack kicks it out Proctor will set it up and unsets the screen and moved the ball well for grandison again and hes wide open to stick the triple a tremendous ball movement look at his seven assists on seven made field goals and it would have been easy for it to Rick Whitehead to have taken that three but he made the extra pass and so this team is connected right now playing as a unit not as individual Louisville needs a little Al Ellis at the moment he started off like a house of fire James she cant hit it running down on that possession as Mitchell brings it across Radisson called for the ball again in the corner hes got a hot hand he wants to shoot him Applause and a foul 9 15 left in the half and Duke jumping on top 2218 Corey we talked today to John Shire about his teams defense and how he had faith and belief that their offense would catch up to their defense and this is exactly what it looks like Gainesville at 7 Eastern Florida hosting Oscar sheboy in Kentucky North Carolina take on Notre Dame at the Joyce Center in South Bend can Carolina pull things together in the nick of time right now they are on the outside look at it as far as the NCAA tournament says Joe dinardi as North Carolina is the team that normally leads the ACC and rebounding but to Andreas Point only one of the things that we talked with cosar about fire to the game was the fact that his foundation this season was based upon their defense and their rebounding he felt like that offense would catch up as the season went along but one thing if they can defend that they can rebound that they can beat anyone at any given moment it is with a tough leader but no so look at the North Carolina tournament resume meeting the conference strength to schedule now early on they played a tough schedule but its not been the case for several weeks Leonardi has the first four out oh and eights Corey against quad ones you know and when you look at that number and again I understand how shock it is to people to loot to beat against quad runs but if you look at the best teams in the country and you say Alabama where Alabama is great it took four overtimes on a neutral floor for Alabama to beat North Carolina true this North Carolina team is because of the preseason number one ranking they carry that Monica that misses Billy bust but it hasnt been that they have the president but its still a very good team but theyre playing also in a very good lead this move does not get the credit fresh reserves a high pretty quality basketball teams are all on the NC State team they ran by them yes thats a really good basketball team that backcourt is dazzling heres Proctor way downtown will bury that hes hit a couple of triples speaking of dazzling this is a freshman thats starting to Dazzle in his role as a point guard continues to play great basketball but back to your point regarding to the NC State team North Carolina beat NC State earlier this year Applause of the games in this league this year still dont think Miami gets near enough credit though not even close that is a great team theres a moniker that the ACC does not have elite team Virginia Miami are Elite yes and the Blue Devils are getting close to becoming Elite once again built a seven point lead here over six minutes weve seen that so many times in this building which is seen now over 500 consecutive sellouts number 504 here tonight Alice trying to get restarted he buries the jumper LL is finally getting some breathing room after he ran off 11 points in the first four minutes of this game the Blue Devils have locked in on him defensively giving very little road debris he was still singing The Anthem by the time he got 11 young will finish that one as he sticks it back up and in he has been such a blessing for the Blue Devils his offensive rebounding had a high clip has been a part of their office here comes Proctor Catching Fire for the land very difficult shot Mitchell left for the dunk couldnt get it Applause it was too easy that was fouled here by grandison thatll be foul number one so well take a timeout when we come back a little history lesson black history and Paving the way what stands out to you well its so many different things stand out to me and of course I look at all these Trailblazers and personally thank each and every one of them for laying the groundwork for me to be able to come and play in this league but Ive also got to give a shout out to the 1983 National Champion NC State Wolfpack which was the first team to ever win a National Championship and start five black players so the ACC has been a Trailblazer along the entire way of black history we have another one in the building here tonight more on that when we get to the second half Applause I mean I had that poster in my room when I was 13 years old and couldnt believe it Obby Ive seen a lot of things in this basketball here one of the most shocking things that Ive ever seen is and Ive had the opportunity to meet David Thompson and I realized he may be an inch taller than me I thought he had to be six seven six eight the way you see him putting his elbows Above the Rim almost touching the top of the backboard and he made me sick for six three it was amazing to see that he was my height jumping that high yes that a human being could get up there take a quarter off the top of the backboard if he wanted to there were all sorts of stories about David Thompson in a lane bottled up here as James he did get free shot clock inside 10 James hes going to drag the foot thatll be a traveling violation and thats one of the things that you know we talked with Coach sire about the fact that Derek Livelys in the game when guys penetrate theyre thinking about the shot block hes second in the ACC in block and hasnt played nearly the minutes that have Jesse Edwards who leads that lead in block shot but the fact that hes back there is an intimidating Factor opponent Applause Music in play in Dukes favor they keep the basketball that really does and again and thats a skill in itself to be able to keep them in Play Everybody Wants their battle clock but goes out of bound beautifully down there by Wagner that turns into a dunk by Mitchell but that was to Rick Whitehead going into the stands practically to save that basketball a great Hustle the effort defensively has been extraordinary from boot outside of L Ellis theyve been able to plant down on everyone else James the open shooter but that ones going to go out of touch by Duke for a 356 to go in the head playing hard is contagious when you see your teammates going after the loose ball going into the stands to save it it means you have to finish on the other end of the floor Mark Mitchell recognizing the bridge right there is great your dog these guys at the touch screen to tell us why tcus favored in that matchup right now though Louisville up 189 then Duke on a run 226 what has changed the ball movement for Duke has been great both in transition and in the half court and youve had other guys Step Up Lively has seven in this game Grandersons come off the bench and knocked down two threes hes got six I love the way theyre moving the ball sir I think the best decision that John Sharp made all season was moving the ball and putting the ball in tireless practice hands his ability to see over defense free up Jeremy roach up the floor as an advanced pass Cory I know youd like to play with a point guard like Proctor because you know what you get more shots not me coach I wanted the ball and the shots that was the difference bonds and I played together in Denver he was the only guy through the basketball too but you know one of the things I got to make sure I correct is that NC State was not the first team to win a National Championship with all five stars it was the first ACC team to win a National Championship with all five stars before 1966 over Kentucky with Adolf Brooke was the first team that was in a national championship with five blocks now pretty good movie about that too to the top for Mitchell and a stop Dukes been Off to the Races like that on many occasions here in the first half since falling behind and now theyre on top 3324 but one of the things you mentioned OV early was the fact that this new team coming off probably its best win of the Season at Syracuse playing well and they continued to improve on their play Calvins Proctor with a hit ahead pass just like five to start talked about Jeremy Rhodes finding Mark Mitchell everyone touching the basketball sharing the ball and the easy baskets allowed him the Blue Devils to play Fast Radisson with the foul and thats just the second personal foul by Duke and first half Music lands outside the three now from 18 now it takes a hit he was shooting at 20 311 to go and a half lets take a look at an upcoming Sonic Blockbuster Virginia and North Carolina Virginias won 10 of their last 11 well when you think about what Virginia is doing they started to settle back in defensively but whats going to issue for the whos as a vote offensively they havent scored over 70 points in their last six games so North Carolina who struggled losing five of their last six gets Virginia try a rematch in the home game with a game that Armando baycott missed all but 37 minutes of the last time out so I know hell be looking forward to that but the Tar Heels need a win in the worst way desperately Music Applause Music Virginia by beating Notre Dame Johnson here for Whitehead up top cant rain Lively keeps it alive back out for his second effort again Applause hes working hard in that lane Duke leads the ACC in rebounding and its not only because theyre finishing up their defensive opportunities but theyre crashing the glass offensively this is the third offensive rebound on that possession alone Mark Mitchell coming up with the hoop and the harm opportunity to finish off an and one Cindy curry with the foul one thing he did very well on Saturday was distribute the ball he had four assists in the game at Circus well he played in the middle of that zone and again having a guy with skill playing in the middle of that zone that can make shots and make plays for his teammates has always going to be something that can hurt we wont even call it a 23 zone for the orange because its never been an actual 23 heres trainer yes Saul met from threepoint Land Jake Walker from JJ trainer right there in a seven point game again Duke has come back taking a lead in this one but they really havent separated themselves from the cards because you know five six weeks ago theyre probably already out of this game especially on the road one thing for certain they struggle on the road but to be where they are right now against it oh he could have done more damage with that as loudly wanted to that was kind of a gentle dunk still counts for two my friend under 23829 uh on the drive and flipped up and in by Withers an easy shot for the 69 Junior and Trey talked to us about hell else being from Durham but David Williams is a North Carolina native also from Charlotte so hes the guy that Im sure has a lot of friends and family in the building today its actually been their best threepoint man 44 for the year stepping back shot and thatll be off Target by Lively Louisville going for it but theyre on the line right in front of their bench and theyre going to turn it back over to the Blue Devils here a couple of teammates going after the ball two wearing the same shirts got a Timeout on the floor Louisville gives it back to Duke when we return to Cameron final seconds here of the first half Louisville shot out to a pretty decent lead Duke caught up man went down on a long run and the Cardinals are staying engaged here Music Applause on the floor with 58 seconds left Mike James his second you would look at the Blue Devils right now Four Freshmen and one Junior on the floor right now and the best freshman this season Kyle phillipowski really hasnt gotten off to a great start in this game hasnt been that effective offensively but when youve got Derek Lively playing the way hes playing Tariq Whitehead Tyrese Proctor Mark Mitchell everyone else stepping up you dont have to have a heroic effort for kilopowski but of course you look at his numbers averaging 151 and 92 rebounds a game this season hes after the capable of heroic efforts Chill on the bench its at a very solid half billipowski out of West Town New York he has four points okay was trying to get a couple of uh good points coaches number John Shire were number 30 here at Duke thats not her death cant hurt at all Ill get it I have an idea that maybe he would have played significant minutes anyway if he was wearing 32 but doesnt hurt as you mentioned as it hurts hes having a terrific freshman year and its going to be an offensive well he hasnt made many mistakes here in the first half who has not but thats really just great defense by phillipowski who gets sucked in helping off of a shooter in a strong side corner but recognizing lls with a full head of steam would have a difficult time stopping and not picking up the offensive Applause threepoint land Applause with 40 seconds left in the half but you cant mind that foul especially when youre putting so much pressure on Louisville attacking that offensive glass its his first Music so the Cardinals to put it in trainer Mr senior averaging 18 a contest Music Applause but the bench for Louisville has three coaches holding up three fingers so he shall see Kyle seconds and a half Applause and thats the end of the half now Louisvilles still in it but Duke opens up a 4233 advantage Kenny Payne has to have loved the start and John Shire has to have loved the finish of this first half L Ellis this time no charge and finds Mike James in the corner looks like his toes the whole year I believe it is the best basketball theyve played consistently but they also have their full compliment of players and healthy and that means a lot to coach John Shire and to his staff and theyre taking advantage of it go over the basketballs here again the second half Ellis could get crooked again it couldnt have been much hotter in the opening minutes of the game he put his team on his back thats going to roll off the iron on the foul uh lets take a look at the game track brought to you by Sargento they opened it up on an 189 run back came Duke Distributing the ball so effectively and really crashing the offensive glass and LL as you look at the numbers for him and the great start 15 points and they fish at five for eight from the field four assists with two turnovers and although Louisville only has six turnovers in that first half those turnovers turned into nine points for the Blue Devils like James at the line lets go down to Dre yeah Dave I talked to head coach Kenny Payne coming out of halftime he said that his team they were the aggressors at first he said we attacked he put them on their heels but when Duke punched back rewilted he said this team has to figure out how to sustain their effort on both ends but offensively attacking the basket making the extra pass and getting open is what he has to see Trey thats one of the things that Kenny Payne talked to us about earlier today was not settling for Chop shots were staying Attack Mode get to the paint knowing that Lively would be there and they would find Opportunities on the perimeter playing inside out four points for roach he got into the bank got exactly the shot he wanted the danger zone of course for normal is the opening seconds of the second half theyve got a brace for a Duke run sounds like youre going to game or two here before as have you my friend way downtown fills it up and they have their biggest lead tonight 2735 and theres something about that halftime conversation in this band of course through 42 years of Coach K John sire doing the same thing this season his first year the Blue Devils always come out of that halftime rock and roll with a little bit more Edge scooped up by Mitchell Proctor Music Applause defense turning into offense the turnovers turning into points and right now Kenny Payne wants to talk it over with his team as the Blue Devils have had all the energy and the momentum coming out of halftime Music Applause in sports than that one right there the basketball going through that clean it absolutely is no better sound of the game even whether youre to gym by yourself or in a gym full of Cameron crazies and we see the Cameron crazies recognizing greatness in the building Nola Smith who won a national championship here alongside John Shire in 2010 those two guys in the same backcourt together and if there was anyone who was expecting this Duke run to start the second half it was this young man Nolan Smith hes been a part of it as a player as a coach and the first time hes coming into this building as the opposition got to believe that was a pretty well informed Scout that he brought to the board today for their workout retain it though Music only Hatfield and the paint drops in two the sixtime sophomore the transfer from Tennessee and a great way to establish something out of a timeout simply because youre not taking a long shot that leads to a breakout for the Blue Devils to get out of transition once again a little previous two months Applause and slams it down goodness thats a play were going to have to add to the book of philipowski hes got so much into his game with so much versatility he can shoot the three he can put it on the floor but also awesome with his back to the basket and his ability to finish around the rim wither and Scott up against live land blocked it and a possession error will take it the other end of the floor itll be Duke ball I just think hes such a smart shot blocker Cory because hes not trying to swat this 14 rows in hes trying to keep possession of it philipowski with a sensational move well and youre talking about the Twin Towers how many college basketball team teams right now do you see playing too big another low two seven Footers on the front line and these guys complimenting each other so very well what Philadelphia does offensively and what Lively does defensively foreign Applause comes back to the Cardinals they just honored their 2013 National Championship team at the Center came about 37 Music James gives it up here for Ellis shot two down five theyll drive it Airborne angle got it to go team well Alice has continued to attack the paint the province of the cards has been they really they havent been able to get much production from anyone else JJ trainers knocked on a couple of Threes but theyre going to have to find someone else that can give them some offensive opportunities Applause Music will need to run all here to stop the clock on the drive by L Ellis and were talking about a moment ago a very very special man here inside the crowd looking professorial indeed CB Claiborne more on him when we return he was given permission to call you two things CB or Dr Claiborne so were gonna go Dr Claiborne all right the players have your last name and number on their shooting shirts you got a standing ovation what does all of that mean to you back on your old stomping grounds well actually it was quite exhilarating to walk out on the court to see my name on the back of the jerseys uh but this is Cameron it it actually isnt surprising it feels like being in camera and for you as the first black player here at Purdue mens basketball what were some obstacles that you faced on your journey well there were a lot of obstacles when I came there were only seven black students on campus so this is the 60s this is the time of systematic exclusion a lot of us couldnt do things I mean our jokius we couldnt even we couldnt even get a haircut on campus for you what kept you moving forward what kept you working through some of those obstacles here my community so I wasnt by myself I had a black community around me but I also had teammates so every time I stepped on this court four other guys stepped on the court with me so I was with my team valuing teammates is something that is so important something that John Shire talks to this team about when you watch this current Duke team what do you want the guys to know about what it means to be here and play for this program well the value of the Brotherhood is real right and I think you can walk out there and score a lot of points but thats not what its about its about being with your teammates and succeeding together I think well listen CB for me as a black woman that played this game and for so many that watched you and that played this game now we just have to say thank you so much all right well thank you thanks for the interview back to you there Dr glamor is terrific isnt he absolutely and of course what else would you expect from a guy from the state of Virginia Danville Virginia you knew I was going to look it up I had to know where he was from representing himself so very well on the microphone thats going to be an offensive clearing out with Huntley Hatfield he commits the foul 6 41 and CB getting an opportunity to go over and see his former coach Bucky Waters giving him a huge hug who actually coach Waters also had here Chuck Bailey with him and you go back and you think about the lineage of Duke coaching Chuck Daly whos assistant coach to coach Buffy Waters also the 1992 dream team coach you know who has the assistant coach on that team that would be won by suggestion its just Mike engines everywhere that Brotherhood runs deep indeed it does Young in the paint well hook it up there went to the bank Applause but Duke is grab control here the second half Louisville still looking for a way back in the Hatfield 610 but that should be a flop even though it was some contact if there were ever a flop that might be the one surprised that the warning was not a warning but the technical foul wasnt thrown out on that one these days goes right now thats bad no thats what were gonna have to talk to flip about that was bad and Lee Hatfields to the line Im sure we will see that on Not Top 10 on Friday this is 75 foul shooter Music still arguing his point there at this point before to the flip that that was not a flop in the Louisvilles not suiting a free throw with no one standing on the lane no flop for flip Applause 5642 Louisvilles been a pretty good foul shooting team its the one area where they are better than their opponents statistically they make 74 percent Applause are picked off by Withers theres Ellis in a triple and a big rebound by Phillip hes one of that one of the best rebounders in the ACC from Jump Street he absolutely has been that it adds so much to this team offensively and defensively as well Ive been you know pleasantly surprised with the way he moves his feet and hes locked in defensively one of the reasons why I think he will be a good NBA player roach on the drive angle to draw the foul new coming in at 198 looking for their 11th win of the conference trying to knock off Kenny Payne and it has been one long year for Louisville a 423 record fouled air against Curry its going to be number four on Sydney Curry and roach will misfied the first time hes coming off 17 at Syracuse on Saturday going to the bench deep deep foul trouble Kenny Payne still coaching them up though he talked to us about just winning small moments it doesnt necessarily who has not always going to result in winning the game as the second chance opportunity for grandison is good and the Blue Devils build the lead to 17 on their 11th offensive rebound but for Kenny Payne again its about winning small moments he understands that right now the record is not going to show the progress as to what has happened to his team this season but at the same time hes still trying to build the culture as to where he wants it development in the future of this program 19 points for his star L Ellis just named ACC coplayer of the week Applause Music Music he absolutely has been dead and again when you change it up and you go away from the rim protection that is Derek Lively and you bring in Ryan young you still have to be accountable for keeping those guys off the offensive glass 15 second chance points for the Blue Devils with is absolutely the difference right now a 15point lead for Duke and 12 offensive rebounds Lively there on the bench for the moment another foul shot coming for young whos really good at the line typically 82 percent fifth of the ACC and offensive rebounding and this is a guy thats barely a starter not playing heavy minutes but still has such an impact when he steps on the floor too Music Alice looking to make a move very bouncy but cant connect Applause Music Louisville Louisville to preserve that possession John Shire not happy with his team after he watched Roosevelt wheeler get on the floor but his guys were standing around no one diving after the basketball and weve talked about Kenny Payne continuing try to coach each and every moment with a you know inexperienced team John Shire may have the youngest team in the league when you think about the Freshman of course he has a couple of grad transfers to Granderson and young but the five freshmen of course theyre very talented but still a very young team still trying to learn their way around college basketball one of those freshmen certainly not playing like one and thats philipowski the seven foot 230 pounder came in averaging 15 points nine rebounds hes taking home another ACC rookie of the wiki compare him with some of the other great ones in their first year here in Duke well when you compare him to these guys one thing that you have to mention is the fact that calphalopowski had a doubledouble his first four games throughout his due career none of these guys guys were able to do that but youre looking at a number two pick a number three pick and a number three pick in the NBA draft Im not saying the Philadelphia goes that high however he has had a similar level of impact on this Duke program as weve seen from those Drakes on their previous graphic travels Duke basketball okay OB saw of course you covered Duke basketball for a very long time I played against Duke and covered Duke basketball for a very long time Im gonna put you on the spot go ahead give me your best Blue Devil best the best Blue Devil boy thats a tough tough bucket I could go right away and say well Christian later will be number one on my list will he be number one on my list as well so again on that one and there have been a lot of Great Blue Devils but I can tell you I played against that guy and in my opinion the best college basketball player that I ever played again just a spec ific test spectacular college player did nothing but win I can remember coming into this building my freshman year of Virginia Christian labor senior year and the first three or four possessions of the game my God my big guy Ted Jeffrey was Ted Jeffries was beating him up he couldnt get anything going on on the post running down the floor I heard late say man forget this and hes pulled up at the top of the key knocked down to three he proceeded to knock down five threepointers in the first half the game was over he scores 30 and he said I just didnt want to battle with you guys you know to paint this game trailer with the duck now think about that thats thats confidence but the ability to just change your game plan tonight hey forget about going inside and this is in 1992 before everyone shot the three ball but you look at the Blue Devils so many greats who have graced this my boy G hilled up top without that bad haircut that he had the national championship game Ill wait to hear from him on that catch up on ESPN coverage beginning at seven oclock eastern time South Carolina barely surviving their last one yes surviving on the road is difficult to win in a row on the road and college basketball regardless as to how good you are another Testament to of course you know one of the things weve talked about with the ACC home teams have won close to 65 percent of their home games a lot of good teams in this league protecting the whole Court the Blue Devils doing exactly that here this evening almost from the opening minutes we talked about how well played as far as passing the basketball up top Proctor cant drain it every Duke player who has played in the game has at least one assist thats eight different players 16 assists in the game that is impressive Ben is a very impressive stat and again it shows really the foundation that John Shire is trying to establish within his program and this truly is his program hes no longer my successful Show Jon sire is the coach here hes doing the recruiting hes doing the coaching and these guys are following his example and its never been more evident in the fact that this team is a defense first rebounding team that is allowing the offense now to catch up as the league right hand lines up another one but Whitehead is another one of those examples and one of the reasons why this new team has gotten so much better as the season gone away HK recently coming into as a fan for the first time here yeah got an opportunity to come in and see a former assistant and Mike gray and uh coach gray was thankful for the huge Bond of wine that Coach K brought here that lands foreign Applause Music Applause Applause Music this is a sweet moment thunderous ovation making the first game back this season said to retired and a strong effort by the Blue Devils to get a win and they close the contested game by Notre Dame no they played very well they did and youd better win that game Coach K says Im coming on Tuesday probably part of the message is hey you better win if Im going to be there and they did it was a very good game like gray by the way one of the best people we know in coaching its going to be sad to see him go for it now Mike has said this is not the end of his coaching career its going to be the end of his Notre Dame coach yes and I think that that is one of the things that should be made very well clear we will see Mike gray on the sidelines again it wont be for Notre Dame but youre talking about one of the better coaches especially on the offensive in the floor that this game has seen over the past 20 Seasons I hope we can grab him for a little while at ESPN put him in the studio you know what hes so laid back no I think hed be great at it but hes not shooting up thats the killer hes got to be able to wear his shorts thats right traitor well knock that one down and its 6151 Duke without a field goal in over four minutes and thats allowed the Cardinals to kind of creep back in it yeah Louisville locking in defensively and making timely buckets and this is one of the things where we talk about the Improvement of the cars they dont you know withering games now they may get down but theyre not just going to walk away shot clock to three for Lebowski got to get a shot in the air its going to be a shot clock violation that did not touch the iron Shire wanted a foul on the shot attempts getting close to five minutes on the drought for the Blue Devils and now an opportunity for the cars to cut this to single digits crowd getting a little bit Restless Alice on the drive hooks the pass trainer trainers down Ellis Scoops it up there cant finish it JJ trainer went down low and grabbing at that right ankle right here right here right here and he is in some pain take a look see trainer with that right foot stepping on philipowskis foot just the basketball play but a tough injury for a guy whos been playing very good basketball from town oh be back to you Kim thank you very much fun Seth great to hear from you guys as we will and this one is over 42 to go Louisvilles still in a contest the Louisville has hung around last possessive opportunity to get it to one of the back door nice play time out the ATO the back door cut by Jeremy Rose to get the bucket to provide a little more separation for the blue ball thats something that has stayed from the coach Kara one of many things coming out of the timeout getting a great play getting the basket Lively thatll be back over to Louisville with another block shot for the seven footer thatll be one thing you know you have to have in to be able to run your atos like that youve got to have all your guys locked in and thats important to be able to come to your huddle everyone on the same page even the coaching staff to know exactly whats necessary at the time in game score but the players will be able to go out and execute as well Music its curling around a foul here against Duke 09 remaining that foul on Proctor number three Cardinals to put it in Music Applause Music Applause Music Withers takes it in the lane up against the lapowski A Little Fall Away great idea but cant cash in seven rebounds for the big guy for Lebowski loses control Ellis up against Proctor lays it up and in three move absolutely I mean it is fun watching El Ellis play hes one of those guys throughout the league that you just enjoy watching him play he plays hard he plays with the emotion and of course he can go get a buck hes 21 started a game like a house of Fire Applause Lively coming up for screen the Proctor from threepoint land hes had a good shooting night hes had a good shooting night and he and Jeremy Rocha played great basketball together in the backcourt weve seen the Blue Devils share the backcourt with twopoint guards before its happened a couple of times where theyve been able to win national championships and speaking of point guards L Ellis a shooting guard scoring guard move to point but with the beautiful Euro to finish with the left hand between Duke two Duke Defenders beautiful play just today a cold player of the week in the ACC hey coming up next on ESPN well take you to Fort Worth for a big one of the big 12 number three Kansas battling number 24 TCU and they could have leading scorer Mike miles back and Mike miles is back hes playing great basketball my question is will the NCAA look at the return of Mike miles when it comes to election Sunday will they talk about the fact that he was injured and what happened with TCU when he was out in comparison with him in the lineup because if you do a little TCU youve got to do it with you youve got to do it with other teams around the country no one has had as many injuries as the Blue Devils has throughout this season but at the same time if theyre going to use that metric for one group theyve got to use it for the others Duke with a foul it was seen that before and its part of as you say the protocol part of the selection process it should be there it should be I mean you think about the number of games that Jeremy roach has missed you think about what the reap Whitehead is doing right now the games hes missed he didnt play against Kansas to start the season Derek Lively missed games throughout the year so when you think about his duty theyre just now getting to be a whole unit and playing great basketball and doing so they really have been outstanding when theyve had everybody healthy with the thefts I just sneak that one into the paint 6653 its 11 turnovers now for Louisville coming up on six and a half minutes to go 13th game with all the players available in their 111 when they do oddly mishandled that one he had dunk right in his hands he has one there five hes gonna want back and go ahead and see JJ trainers back with the flu after Tony did anchor though nice follow two points for a hit given five over continues to hang around refusing to get blown out to this point Applause Music loads to drive it skips into the paint and its gonna fall for him think about how much of a better team to do that with all the German results you take him off the floor and again its a different team that has to be judge threepointers swished in by trainer hitting 28 percent from threepoint territory hes coming up a really good game against Clemson thats 16 points nine rebounds but Trader shoots it better as they start remember starting lineup as of late and starting to play with a lot more confidence than he did when he was coming off the bench and he cuts the Duke lead to 10 on the back down phillipowski they swing it here for the jumper by Proctor not this time another opportunity to get it into single digits but if youre able to do that by the next media timeout Im sure Kitty Payne will look at that as they win Applause and off for James trainer again a triple line driving that one for a miss still up 10 so theyve been a handful of times where Louisville had that opportunity to get within double figures theyve been unable to do it Applause Jeremy roach that one kicks looked like off of Duke but should be off Louisville yeah Keith Kimball had a good look on that one went over and corrected the call which is the correct call went off of Brandon Hunley Hatfield off his foot out of bounds but the camera crazies were sure to allow a great officiating crew to know that was going the wrong direction six to get off a shot here for the Blue Devils and a timeout Proctor at issue getting it in so takes the time out with about four and a half to go Dukes still on top 6858 here at the ACC tonight ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is brought to you by Wendys two for six dollars the bestie listen you cant direct the traffic there thats what he does eight different directions 6858 with four and a half to play Duke to check it in after taking the timeout six seconds on a shot clock still having trouble bounces in here for Roach to get a quick strike out of timeout but thats a bent move Jeremy Rhodes recognizing he had more than enough time he didnt have to just throw up a shot once he caught the basketball got him for the flight to the rim off the glass and a big bucket to instead of league as well whatever Duke is needed a big move theyve gotten one all night Music James suddenly has to look ready for it hes going to stay inside and draw the foul yesterday Brad and Huntley Hatfield the 610 sophomore from Clarksville Tennessee heading to the line as he was fouled by Lively underneath number two you look at this Louisville Cardinals team you you look at the pieces and of course Im pretty certain that Kenny Payne and his staff will hit the transfer portal hard this year but there are a number of pieces that they have you think about a guy like Brandon Hundley Hatfield at the free throw line who was the top 100 recruit went to Tennessee come to Louisville in his second season El Ellis could play a covet year he could have a fifth year whether thats with Louisville or somewhere else to be able to finish out his college basketball career if he doesnt decide to put his name in the NBA draft but youve got a lot of pieces with the cards program right now Mike James comes to mind that you can build around to try to bring in Talent to help benefit but he says hes going to practice today it is not about me my kids dont care about that and I dont make it about me well want lost record at this point which is of course 423 now those losses are on his shoulders at the end of the day Music but cant convert and he go the other way quick talk with Kenny Payne just about you know the fact that you know right now theyre 423 thats a struggle from a guy who has won his entire life you go back and forth winning a national championship and Louisville as a player but also winning a national championship as an assistant coach at Kentucky hes used to Win It and you talked to him about some of the people that he leans on and he talks to during these tough times of course the first name he mentions is Larry Brown and roach with the left hand so they get the defensive play by Young and they convert on the other end and theyre back up by 12 great play by Lively stopping the opportunity at one end with the block shot starting the fast break Applause I dont want to pass there terrific pass by Mike James is not going away and the thing is the longer this game goes of course a 10 point lead is difficult to overcome but at the same time they put a little more pressure on the Blue Devils to make the right play each and every time down the floor here down the stretch Duke running a little bit of clock here 222 to go Mitchell making his move using that Rumble beautifully good to watch these freshmen grow up right before our eyes for the Blue Devils we know about Philadelphia but hes not the only one well its the second time he only has done that an outstanding defensive plays here in the last couple of minutes time for tonights need to know brought to you by Principal Financial Group most 1 000 Point scores the D1 history a little 69 to 67 Carolina at the top Music Lions cant hit it thatll be back over to Duke I think maybe the score of this game would surprise a good Manning fans who are tuning in here in the last two notes but Ill tell you who will not surprised coaches throughout the ACC because each and every one of them Ive talked to has said the same word about Louisville theyre dangerous now they were not dangerous to start the season they werent dangerous to start the ACC season but now theyre dangerous and thats a testament to Kenny Payne and his you know AllStar staff would you consider the fact that theyve kept these guys playing and playing hard even though the record doesnt show success Music Applause Music at one point Music ing off a roach roach into traffic yeah theyll get Roosevelt wheeler the Watson Jeremy Rhodes when hes not always settling for jump shots is Paul McCarroll pops Joe in the stands of course always represent the crew making that trip down from Leesburg Virginia heavy miles on the car get from Leesburg I had to drive up one time to go work out with Jeremy its that drive like from my house and I live in Virginia its two and a half hours you probably add another two and a half here youre talking at least four and a half five hour trip but what a thrill they love it they they enjoy it to be able to see your son play here and play really well be a part of something as magnificent as this college basketball and you get a chance to see him do it on a regular basis get in the car and go absolutely and he committed to Duke very early he didnt wait around for a senior year to make the truth as a junior he knew exactly where he wanted to go and of course Im sure his parents as well as coach sire very happy that he stuck around for as long as you have Miller lining up a long one that goes in and out its just a shame theyre not a drink every time I get them on Kevin having a good time well coming up with a one minute mark and Duke is about to assault this one away leading 7662 Over Louisville for John Shire this is no small thing foreign Applause Music Applause Music better basketball and this next time of year would you want to be playing your best going into March two Proctors did a big factor to be blocked by wheeler out it goes here with 178 showing Applause the fans about to celebrate the inside Cameron Indoor another victory for the Blue Devils Applause of the season 20 for John Shire in year one now 208 and 116 in the ACC as we take a look at the Capitol
