play without Marcus Burton their allconerence point guard music That puts Harelson Moore into the fire having to do more and hes going to have to play well tonight if the Irish are going to take down the Canes Carson Tout jumping center with Ernest Uday And in a surprise Uday doesnt win the opening tip He does almost every night He is number one in the country at winning that opening tip I would have said I would have eat my hat if he doesnt win this tip Im glad you didnt do that Heres Tal His pass intended for Logan Ives taken away by True Washington Hes second in the ACC in steals per game Hes got his first already tonight He is a thief in basketball shorts and we were going to mention that before he even got that steal He is fantastic at getting in the passing lane and then converting steals to opportunities on the offensive end Yeah 21 steals per game Washington trails only BJ Edwards of SMU in that category Heres Donaldson back over to Washington working on Braden Shrewsbury who just picked up that foul Tout pulls down his first rebound He was the best rebounder in the country last year during his last year before transferring from Northern Arizona As you see the starting five continuing without Marcus Burton as he recovers from ankle surgery Logan Ims in the starting lineup because of that misses his first shot Yeah both teams controlling their defensive glass Got two fantastic rebounders on the floor Theres a block shot inside Heres the coachs kid Junior from Granger Indiana Braden Shrewberry He is a threepoint shooter extraordinaire leads the ACC at 45 Yeah you can see Notre Dame being very patient with their offense trying to work the ball around get a high percentage shot They want to slow this game down They want a game played down in the 70s cheering and applause the Hurricanes want this thing in the upper 80s Harelson stepped out of bounds And Notre Dames calling card this year its defense Number one in the conference allowing only about 63 points per game But as you talked about Miami is third at putting points on the board 88 points a game And so Micah Shrewsbury very concerned about not letting the Canes get out and run Yeah And they get out and run by getting those turnovers like we saw that uh Washington getting into that passing lane Theyre a pick and roll team Youll see a lot of pick and rolls out of the high post with Uh today Seven on the timer Donaldson picks up his dribble Malik Renu his first shot off the front iron He is among the league leaders in scoring Renu at 206 per game Got a foul on the rebound against Ernest Uday Jr Yeah And Renu can go both inside and out This guy is very skilled basketball player Asked coach Lucas like who does he remind you of He kind of said that is Young would be a pretty good comparison Lefty that can score Ives puts it on the deck looking to dump it off as always Tout the extra pass and then the foul as Harelson went up Well the extra pass inside I thought Tout had a good opportunity to go up with some power himself but uh he dished it off and thats a good extra pass You could see coming over trying to block that shot U Jr He got whistled for is that second foul on Uday though hes one of their primary rebounders primary shot blockers primary players that they put in pick and roll Shoots 70 from the field Yeah U is second behind only Caleb Wilson in the league in rebounds per game Third is tout So we have a great showdown tonight but its going to be put on hold for now as UDE sits down with two personal fouls And into the game Sali Altunis Yeah Altunis This is a big strong wide body as well You you dont miss much as far as the size when he comes in to replace U Yeah Altuna 610 274 a freshman from Istanbul And on the miss free throw weve got a foul Both both teams off to kind of a slow start here Parters Its more of a hockey score right now One nothing Irish That foul on Carson Tout Renu The Indiana transfer Big size advantage on draws the second defender Shelton Henderson the terrific freshman for the Canes Gives it back out front Drew Washington off the glass a little too tall You can see the Irish really trying to choke off the middle and the interior not letting the Canes get inside for those points in the paint that they so desperately love Shrewsbury puts it up and in That is how you shoot 45 on the year Well thats exactly what the coachs son does He gets himself out behind that threepoint line and gets on balance Hes got the mismatch You can see that jab step at the bigger player there Renu gets him back pedaling Gives him an opportunity to get a cleaner look at the front of that rim File on that rebound Altunis And so the possession continues for the Irish It could be a five or sixpoint possession Harrelson to the rim Andy cheering throws it down Five legs Great job of reading the defense realizing I can get along that baseline And I like how he goes up with power and finishes off the play Well he was the headliner of the number five recruiting class in the country last year Paul Biancardi says his versatility is his calling card cheering Donaldson gives it back to the freshman Henderson from the corner cheering Well if youre Coach Struberry and company on that brain trust over there you got to love this start Kings getting nothing inside and getting one shot done I with a rare turnover He takes care of the basketball very well but not that time on his drive into the lane Yeah a little surprising to see I cough that one up with not much pressure around him The kids been absolutely fantastic in his assist to turnover ratio in ACC play ACC play Hes number one at 37 assist and that is just his 13th turnover of the season We got a look at Kevajai backup senior center for Notre Dame The Irish in their white the Hurricanes in their road greens Washington into Renu Double team The lefthander backs it out Keeps the dribble now with a terrific pass along the baseline How did he find the freshman Shelton Henderson Henderson in big body I dont know how Notre Dame lost him The kid goes 245 lbs You can see hes got live legs He can finish above the basket Another turnover Renew the deflection Here comes Henderson His second slam in a row Gets the Hurricanes back to within two And weve got a stoppage with an injured Notre Dame player Its Kev Jai slowing it up Dame got left out of the college football playoffs this year Well the good news around here is that as Adam Shaper is reporting this afternoon Marcus Freeman is expected to remain the head coach here at Notre Dame in 2026 despite the interest from several NFL teams So he will be back next fall Dont know why hed leave here This is a beautiful place Hes got a chance to drive around the Golden Dome I could not find Touchdown Jesus Uh they told me it was near the library so I think I got a little sweaty palms when they told me it was close to the library didnt want to go over there Its on the library You just were on the wrong side of the library I think Another takeaway for the Hurricanes Yeah three steals now for the Hurricanes Theyre doing a great job putting that pressure on the Irish Fourth turnover Teimo Malovitz into the game for the Canes Renu bottled up by Tal Somehow he finds Donaldson and the reigning ACC player of the week has his first two games tonight Two points tonight Donaldsons so good at throwing a shoulder into the defender You create enough space to get a shot off Well its 63 198 You know hes a grown man and will do those sort of things Irish back in front Eight to six Malovitz around and out Thats what thats what Malovich does He call they call him Three Mo because all he does is shoot threes Harrelson off the spin No Renew cleans the glass quickly up ahead once again His third time up above the rim already Shelton Henderson has six of the eight Miami points Thats exactly what the Canades want to do Control their defensive glass and then look ahead They got big strong athletic bigs that have live legs that can run the floor And they do that Scott as well as anybody in the ACC Get the ball forward in transition Harelson left it short Tout got a piece of it Here comes Miami again Donaldson the senior from Tallahassee Washington working on Cole Serta Took him right to the basket Banked it in First lead of the night for the Hurricane Well he got some big steps down in that lane down below those letters of the ACC logo Im not quite sure if he didnt take an extra step down there but nonetheless he was able to put that thing off the glass find the bottom of the basket giving the Hurricanes another lead here Harrelson goes down hard after drawing the foul and he will shoot two music First foul on Shelton Henderson And theres the first year head coach of the Hurricanes Jay Lucas former Texas Longhorn and he has put together a roster that has compiled a 142 mark to music start his head coaching career including nine wins in a row coming into tonight Doing a fantastic job Hes got developed some good chem team chemistry on the squad These guys not only are fantastic players that hes brought in here Uh winners older players seniors graduate stu uh players but hes also got them believing and trusting in one another Its fun to watch I remember when Lucas was just running around the courts when I was playing for his father in Philly 32 years ago Hes a first grader We had to worry about stepping on little Jay out there on the court laughter Scott Williams former Philadelphia 76er where he played for Jay Lucass father And you think about that the the influences Jay has had I mean he grew up in a household with a father who was a head coach in the NBA and then all he has done is gone to Florida to play for Billy Donovan to Texas to play for Rick Barnes and then his coaching journey as an assistant from coach Barnes Coach Caliperry Shaka Smart uh on and on And John Sh most recently at Duke Yeah but you cant tell me Coach K wasnt around the program a lot there too So boy has he got a coaching tree to lean on some experience from So I asked him uh at shootaround today as a first year head coach you have your voice now you hear yourself Who do you most hear of all of those influences and he laughed and immediately said well dads number one dad Yeah But he was laughing about the fact that apparently during a film session recently he said get out and do the 125 And nobody knew what it was except for one of the assistants who was with him with Rick Barnes Apparently thats one thing Coach Barnes says all the time The 125 in transition Point guard shooting guard rim running center 125 You got to do that And he just chuckled Well thats coach Barnes Thats it Throw it up Get it out to the wing Let your wing feed the big Reward him for running the floor Get a high percentage shot If not go to the free throw line Also works a 135 as well if you got the small forward running on the right side Well we have seen that a 125 a 135 already as a team as a collective unit They get out and run very very well Noom Dat a junior from Israel number 14 in green is out there Also Dante Allen number 35 defending against Sir Muhammad Yeah Brady Kaylor is also committ Hes got the basketball for the Irish Allen comes from good pedigree as well his father Malik played in the NBA when I was in the league Nice poke away by Donaldson who gets it back and immediately on the fly Allen has it poked away Irish defense holds Irish doing a better job now measuring the speed of the Kades Garrett Sundra gathered and then was fouled by Dock Well that time it was the Irish stealing a little page out of the Kanes playbook there Got that turnover under the basket and raced it down the floor So to the free throw line Garrett Sun a sophomore from Ashurn Virginia out of powerhouse Paul V 6th High School Theres more mens Super Tuesday basketball later tonight in the Big 12 as unbeaten and second ranked Iowa State face Kansas at Allen Fieldhouse Coverage begins at 9 Eastern over on ESPN and also the ESPN app And of course the Cyclones are one of only five undefeated teams remaining Arizona Nebraska Vanderbilt Miami Ohio But the Cyclones at 16 and0 have been dominant Thats going to be a great game certainly seemed like the team to beat in the Big 12 Yeah theyre theyre a fantastic squad Well put together on both the offense and the defensive side of the ball Going to Allen Fieldhouse Thats going to be a battle though Theyre going to have to work for put out I should say one of the teams to beat Obviously Arizona right there Still with all the conference realignment Got to stop and think okay youre not in the pack 12 anymore Tied at 11 Notre Dame and Miami Hurricanes one of three teams left in the ACC in conference play without a loss That is eight early points with a chance for nine as Shelton Henderson took the foul This young freshman is impressive He can drive the ball from the short wing area right into the heart of that Iris defense His concentration after contact is second to none for a freshman Um and he was able to finish that play with the left shoulder right hand hook Well he looks like a football player His uncle is Pro Football Hall of Fame running back Eric Dickerson but apparently Shelton doesnt really like to play football He doesnt mind contact on the hardwood on the grid iron Forget it Got it Got it Thats too bad Marcus Freeman might have tried to offer him a little NIL deal So we can look at Freeman the way excuse me Henderson the way he has started this first half Its been all power moves to the basket Nearly eight minutes gone here at Purcell Pavilion at the Joyce Center Sir Mohamd was fouled and then coming to make sure the shot didnt get anywhere near the basket Alunas Well the Canes have picked it up after missing their first five shots from the floor They have made six of their last seven but thats not been so much against the Notre Dame halfcourt defense Theyve been doing it in transition getting out in transition and running getting those steals getting the ball off the board and taking off Sir Mohamad played with his dad in the NBA as well Nazi Mohamd So we got a lot of guys out here with a lot of uh NBA uh experience from their from their parents Yeah his dad Nazi a 1998 first round pick out of Kentucky and he three of you He spent 18 years in the NBA You only got 15 years in the league Scott I taught him so well He was a little rookie when he joined me in Philadelphia I was actually quite proud knowing soaked up everything that I learned from John Paxton Bill Cartride and Michael Jordan who by the way theres theres a been a Pax side in the house One of the alltime greats in Notre Dame history is back at his alma mater here tonight Well you give him a clean look like that and Noam Dorat is going to bury it now Nine for 33 on the year Well thats a great job of moving the ball They got the ball to who they wanted to at the point of attack So again precision passing by the Canes leads to a high percent shot Largest lead of the game Here comes Sir Mohammed Takes the bump puts it up and he will be at the line when we come back Shooting two An entertaining start to our basketball game tonight here at Southbend What about Shelton Henderson Those are three NBA guys who his head goes to when he sees big number seven in green This is my third time now getting opportunity to see the big young man work and I get more impressed with him each time that I see him The one thing that coach Lucas wants him to improve upon is his rebound 43 rebounds per game With a frame that size he could probably try to get that up in the second half of the season by at least a rebound or two the rest of the way Well he is known J Lucas has known Shelton Henderson since Henderson was a seventh grader And the physique you see now is basically what it was then Didnt start doing weight training until he was in high school And indeed he looks like a boxer an MMA fighter a football player First two points for Malik Renu in terms of a made bucket The senior out of Mont Academy in Miami makes it 1914 Hurricane Hes so good with that right shoulder turn left hand hook off of glass absorbing contact much the way Henderson does doing a really good job putting that ball in the basket Mohamd a little short on the corner three I like about Donaldson He gets on the glass as well Looked like Henderson had himself another layup or dunk Instead he passed it to the corner and missed three Maybe hes hurt his wrist Hes had three power slams already in this first half by those Theres a good bucket inside Was that Arlson going inside again That was Sir Mohammed Oh Mohamd Yeah Nazis cant go inside for a bucket So what do you see Are there any similarities between Sir Mohamd and his father who was a firstround pick back in 98 Yeah Out of Kentucky His dad a little bit taller more of a post player playful is back to the basket I love the energy of this guy We saw him in practice yesterday Just kept attacking that basket Doesnt have a great outside shot yet Thats still in development but boy can he get to the rack His careerhigh so far came last month against the Evansville Purple Aces here in this building when he scored 21 points His freshman year here was hampered because of a knee problem and finding his way for Micah Shrewberry cheering Chel Henderson just 54 on the year at the free throw line Misses the second tout back into the ball game Gets the rebound for the Fighting Irish Yeah they got a couple poor free throw shooters on that Miami Kane Hurricanes basketball squad and talked to coach Lucas about he said we just want to make sure we shoot a lot of free throws and everything else will average out If they go 19 for 30 hes fine with it Toutton stepped out of his left shoe got it back on as play continues Seven on the shot clock Mohamed goes the other way and gets the friendly bounce Iron so kind How about Mohamd flashing the footwork down there in the low post Seven points for the sophomore out of Meyers Park High School in Charlotte Yeah this kid averages 45 points per game So when you got lose your top score they did in Burton you got to get guys that step up Drew Washington lines it up and buries the three It just looks so pretty when a lefty strokes a three And thats a great job again sharing that basketball Thats twice now they have found their hot shooters out there on that perimeter Well the U has various weapons Four of their starters average better than 13 per game including Drew Washington Mohamd has it poked away by Renew And the Canes have it once again on the run But theyre dangerous in transition Donaldson coming off his careerhigh 27 point performance in Saturdays win over Georgia Tech and he steals this one IMS didnt see him coming and its a quick two for the Canes Eight turnover committed by the Irish Well coach Shrewsbury said that was the first thing he said I said What worries you about this hurricane Steve And he said The fact that they can turn you over and score so quickly and you cant really blink after they get that turnover because they are at the basket Harelson back out to Mohhamd whos been feeling it so far tonight He continues the hot hand How about this young fellow One dribbles down along that baseline stops on a dime rises up I tell you what hes got it stuck on automatic right now And Notre Dame really needs his offensive output Renu goes to the floor and he was fouled And that brings us to our under eight media timeout The Irish hanging around the Canes up five Surprised to see a Hooers fan at this time wearing that uh sweatshirt Yeah Shouldnt he be making his way down to Miami Have you seen the prices I have seen the prices of those tickets You know were doing a game down there on the 20th I might get down there and try to sneak in Malik Renu off the inbound makes it 27 20 Renu snuck in on that bucket there Were sitting there running our mouth about football and he went right to the rack Got another point in the paint Thats 16 points in the paint now cheering for the Kates Cole Sa the most confident shooter on this Irish roster His first shot goes down Well I like this kid sa he had some big shots the other day in their game on Saturday but the precision passing again by the Hurricanes They are just slicing and dicing the interior of that Iris defense now They started this game shooting 27 Now theyre up to 60 from the field Harelsons pass looked like it was kicked No call It goes out of bounds and will stay at this end I tell you what these uh officials are letting them play but I love this right this you know you see a heavy dose of pick and roll they normally do with Uday Junior That time Reduce says Hey I can slide my biscuits down this lane Get to the front of that basket for power jam Got six assists for the Canes Just one for Notre Dame Im doing a lot of oneonone basketball here to try to get that ball in the hole But hey still a two possession game Well thankfully for Notre Dame Sir Mohamad has had it working He rattled off nine straight Irish points Then the three from Cole Serta who tries it again and hes got it Six in a row for the sophomore from Laroy Illinois Oh wow Cole sort of got it stuck on automatic You know hes shooting 38 in ACC play right now So backto back threepoint shots for Cole Ser Thats going to that number is going to get ready to rise and hes now seven for 12 in the last three Notre Dame games beyond the arc Mattzich hands it off to Washington cheering Pulls up off the front iron That Notre Dame half court defense still tough to penetrate for Miami When they get a chance to get that defense set like you said they are real tough to get a bucket against Serta hunting Missed it to the left I think that is what they call at the next level Be the heat check cheering Renu went to his off hand and Ill tell you what Garrett Sundra read it beautifully He was up for the challenge That kid must be watching some film on his opponent So Ky realizing Renus going to come back with that right hand He was right there to put it back into the top of his chest and then Renuse stepped out of bounds with those Adidas along that baseline Ryder Frost has come into the game for the first time for the Fighting Irish A 67 freshman number seven in white Heres Logan Ims Hes done a good job getting paint touches tonight Trying to develop and create Cant do it that time Here comes Miami with numbers Threeon two Malovitz into the corner Donaldson spins and gets tied up by Serta And theyve got some things to say to each other Donaldson just so crafty though right along that baseline He does that little spin move and then he gets his arms like up and through into the defender and catches Certain not really reaching out at Donaldson but with his arms extended James Harden guy playing up in the NBA Hes so good at that doing that By the way Harden just passed Shaquille ONeal for number nine on the alltime NBA scoring list Saw that Good job by our officials tonight Ron Groover Justin Porterfield Pat Driscoll to talk to both of those two guys to make sure it didnt escalate Thursday night at 7 Eastern on ESPN 2 in the ESPN app it is a womens basketball top five matchup Fourth ranked Texas takes on number two South Carolina in Colombia Now the Longhorns won by two points on a buzzer beater by Rory Harmon in Vegas back in November Sedon Staley squad will be looking for a little bit of payback Thats Thursday night 700 on ESPN 2 Yeah you know Coach Staleys put that game film on a time or two to get her players fired up for the basketball contest Again I able to beat his initial defender to get into the lane trying to break down this Miami defense Now Harelson draws the foul that goes against Shelton Henderson Terrific matchup of those two freshmen Yeah And thats the ninth team foul now on the Kane So going to send him to the line for a couple free throws And Harelson at the free throw line Boy it its been a mystery here uh since the start of ACC play Just 11 of 23 47 from the free throw line Now Harelson told me yesterday that even though he chose Notre Dame over Indiana he is a Hooers football fan when it comes to next weeks college football championship because his older brother Brandon went to IU And Jaylen says hes probably been to Bloomington a 100 times in his life So he says he doesnt have any Indiana University gear with him here on campus Probably a good thing But he does have some Hooers gear back home Hell be pulling for Indiana against Miami for the national championship Saying that Notre Dame is in the state of Indiana you think thered be a little state pride there right Like youd have enough guys pulling for Indiana No No Too much Are you going to root for Duke anytime soon No No Absolutely Same state right Same conference No Uhuh Yeah I didnt think so No State aint big enough And I like this kid Cambooz and I love what hes doing I watch a lot of Duke basketball just to see him perform But you think Caleb Wilsons better Wow Even hesitation from Atarheel I love Caleb Wilson That kid all laughter he does is get double doubles monster jams you know top sports center top 10 plays once a week but this kid boos are special Teemo Malovitz the freshman from Slovakia makes the first And now Ernest Ude who picked up a couple of fouls in the first two minutes of the game comes back with five remaining in the half That has been a big piece missing The third leading rebounder in the country saddled with foul trouble and hes been so good scoring the basketball the last couple of games as well Hey Coach Lucas is rolling the dice Hes bringing him in and he almost got a third foul right there going off to that offensive rebound So I I understand why Jays probably bought back Say Hey listen Lets get him loose a little bit Lets get him back into the flow of the game Probably wont play music all five minutes but lets get him a couple minutes see if we cant stop that uh interior attack get the ball off that glass and try to get a few more transition points to get the momentum of this uh first half back on our side This game is tight Thats all all the ACC games 75 of the ACC games decided by three and a half points Sundra left alone a little strong I attacks and gets the rebound over to Frost Good ball movement for Notre Dame I from 24 ft around it out Malovich immediately to Allen The dump off trying to find Uday Notre Dame back the other way again Uday not ready to play That was a good little pass in there Serta goes right around Allen Off the window No Uday hustling back for the rebound after falling on the floor I am a guys big guys that can get out transition both ways Dante Allen missed the three and a foul on the rebound Malovitz Yeah theyre going to get Trey Udos way UDs right about it being on him but youre right I think they got uh three down there coming over the back Yeah good for Miami Its number 88 not number eight who picked up that foul Yeah and the uh the 10th team foul now uh on the Kane So with 4 minutes and 10 seconds remaining in this half with each team foul the Irish will be shooting two free throws Well neither of these teams shoot the free throw particularly well Both under 70 Notre Dame is 12th in the ACC at 69 Miami even worse at 68 Third from the bottom But it was interesting talking to Jay Lucas earlier today the Miami head coach about how they have formulas to offset that They dont sweat the fact that they are what they are from the free throw line and they dont shoot as many threes as others Theyve just got to make up those points in other ways Yeah Getting on offensive rebounds second chance points points in the paint Um all those types of things uh can offset that Hey hes saying it Arizona one of the top teams in the country the top team in the country They only make six threes a game They get out in transition and run They get second chance points They get to the free throw line Theres other ways to score than from behind that arc Under four minutes left in the half Donaldson has had a quiet night scoring the basketball a triple hill This game could be tight Sera know that is six straight missed by Notre Dame Sundra though on the offensive glass Serta going to try it again after the fly by draws the groan from the crowd here in Southbend The possession continues though Serta tries a twopoint shot Sundra another offensive rebound and Frost finally cashes in Five opportunities They are out working the Kings Coach Lucas wants a timeout He takes that time out This games noted up at 32 What an energy by Notre Dame Got to love it I love college basketball Thing that happened to me for my basketball career Guys like John Paxton and Bill Cartwright Michael J Jordan they they they taught me how to be a pro not an NBA player but a professional and to go about your craft as a pro and it led to me being a 15year veteran of the NBA I could thank Pax enough with El Gave him a big bear hug Now youve got one of your Chicago Bulls NBA championship rings one of your three Which one is that This is the 1992 championship ring And uh it was the it was the year that I got to play start to finish and that means the most to me as Renu goes inside again They run a play for him out of each time out when they need a bucket They go to their primary scorer and he has delivered And why not averaging over 20 points per game Look at this Miami coming out with a little zone defense to give the Irish a different look here Under three to play Sundro back to Frost A logo three is good and Notre Dame has the lead Its first since 8 to six WOW screaming WHAT A SHOT HIS feet were on the D and Notre Dame love He knocked it down Well Miami gets those three right back off the fingertips of Dante Allen Allens been going to the basket for buckets and hasnt been able to get one to go This time he stepped out on the perimeter That is three times now in this first half They have found threepoint shooters along that right side Sundra and Mohamd have been so good off the bench for Notre Dame here in the first half Mohamed long rebound And again its another offensive rebound for Notre Dame And Frost once again this time cant knock it down But another offensive rebound the sixth for the Irish Irish are out working them on the glass You dont see the Canes get beat up on their defensive glass with the Irish taking it to him right now And Miami back to manto man defensively 3 seconds of travel Sorry they got to travel down there Hines are down there like a uh a whalish Dur trying to spin around to find some space to be able to get him a shot over the taller defender but theyre going to say he drugged that pivot foot and they whistled him for the trouble Yeah when you said 3se secondond violation Im like I dont think theyve called one of those since you were playing at Carolina Well they dont call traveling anymore since I was at Carolina but most of the time they give these guys the opportunity to drag that paper play Heres Freo out of the corner Malovitz no good has had a very good first half for Notre Dame Yeah hes struggling here in this first half He cannot get a shot to fall He is 0 for two from behind the arc Again Notre Dame continues to play without its allconerence point guard Marcus Burton who underwent left ankle surgery back on December 10th Not sure if they will get him back His rehab is going well Harrelson no Mohamd cleans it up Seven offensive boards without U down there to clean up the defensive glass averaging over 10 a game They are getting outworked and just manhandled on the boards Renu unable to give Miami the lead once again And now Mohamed takes his time into the front court Puts on the Jets Open look for Sundra fight for the rebound Comes to Sundra Another offensive opportunity Mohamd dumps it off to Harelson who gathers Notre Dame fortunate to keep it with 15 on the shot clock Yeah Renew was almost out here by us when that offensive rebound was secured by the Irish They got to do a better job of game rebounding sending five guys to the glass Notre Dame uses music the timeout so will step away have one of the young fellas do that nowadays But you can see the ball redirect after it hit his foot It changed direction So the officials theyve been a good crew Theyve been right on top of it here in this first half Ron Groover Pat Crystal Justin Porterfield Harrelson lobs the inbound to Sundra And now gives to Haroldson He gets tied up Here come the Canes Plenty of time left in the half Washington no Good hustle to tap it in by Dante Allen I looks up at the clock He goes to the basket and gets those two points right back Logan I a tremendous first half for the junior from Zansville Indiana They head to the locker room tied at 39 Yeah I love the energy and the spirit and what the Irish have played in this first half very much in favor of Notre Dame We showed you how well Miamis gotten to the basket And then Sir Muhammad has been a revelation off the bench 11 points to lead all scorers As we start the second half Mohamd on the bench Braden Shrewsbury back in the starting lineup He had a couple of fouls in that first half and was very quiet on the offensive end Only three points for Notre Dame And as we saw throughout the first half Scott Miami coming out of a timeout goes right to Malik Renu Hes the dude right like they needed a bucket Coach Lucas aint no dummy He gets the ball in the hands of a new Look at this Another turnover He gets the ball in the hands of Renew and he bangs away at the inside for easy basket Hes got 11 points now in this game Unforced error though You know in a tight basketball game you had a little uh coming going to the break you coming out of locker room you give up a bucket inside and then an unforced error right here at the midcourt strike cheering Heres Trey Donaldson Six points four assists in that first half the reigning ACC player of the week at the point for the Canes Renew No And here is IMS who has eight rebounds including four offensive rebounds The Irish need to get Shrewsbury going and hes had a an up and down season It seems like he either scores 20 or he scores three That time unable to stop Trey Donaldson on his heatseeking miss to the bucket Just like a blur Just a clean green blur right in front of us Little inside out mo middle move Then goes along that baseline and finds per on that that uh right side of the backboard Garrett Sundra had a productive first half He hands it off to Logan cheering Carson Tout had a couple of fouls in that first half He had a limited impact for Notre Dame Got to keep him out there on the floor Hud with those three fouls went in there and tried and he wreak that ball out I thought maybe there might have been a whistle there cheering Well you can see why Shelton Henderson is third in the ACC at 61 from the floor That bucket draws a timeout by the Fighting Irish We welcome you back to Southbend Indiana with Scott Williams Im Doug Sherman Miami has started this second half on a 60 run Notre Dame had to use a timeout Micah Shrewsbury trying to get a good look He gets one out of his freshman Harelson He couldnt finish but hell go to the line to shoot two Yeah they they had one field goal coming out of the locker room at halftime A wild three by the coaches kid Two turnovers Im sure coach Rusberry told them at that timeout break Lets attack inside the way Miami has for the quick six points that they have to start this second half That foul on Uday is his third He had no points and only two rebounds in the first half because of foul trouble And again big number eight in green is among the best rebounders not just in the ACC but in the country Yeah he hes coming off a game where he had 10 and 15 10 points 15 boards So hes got to get himself going here in this second half And Miami is want to win this game Harelson gets one out of two Washington works his way into the lane on Shrewsbury keeps his balance and puts it up and in Wow Took on three Fighting Irish inside True Washington Theyve been coming to Renew out of these timeout situations but that time they put the hand the ball in the hands of their speedster Washington and he was able to get inside Eight straight points inside in that paint to start the second half now for the Kings Well Washington is the guy who made the half court shot to end shootound earlier today The rejection by Renu That kid is long How often do you see someone get their threepoint shot blocked He made it look easy Locked it then caught it The lob to the rim That was beautiful But no bucket A foul on the drive as Trey Donaldson keeps this Notre Dame defense on its heels What a block shot by the length of Renew Yeah he just got out here saw that going in a shooting motion to be able to block that shot and then not come through the body of the shooter and get it cleanly Its a better looking effort now out of the Canes and we saw the last five minutes of that first half working much harder Well you talk about the length of Malik Renewi 69 238 A lot of that comes from his mom Melanie who starred at then division 2 Cheney University outside of Philadelphia Shes an athletics hall of famer at that school And its the same HBCU that is better known back in its days as Cheney State It helped to launch the coaching careers of Naymith Hall of Famers John Cheney and see Vivian cheering Stringer Maliks mom a Hall of Famer there Here goes her son who draws the foul Yeah hes a handful Yeah he he was a honorable mention all Big 10 performer uh in Indiana two years running before getting back to his home state of Florida to finish out his senior year You think hes got some friends and fans uh here in in the arena that hes trying to impress cuz he has come out like gang busters here in his second half Well he has been among the better scorers in the nation Hes gone for 20 or more in 10 of 16 games this year Thats third in the country One of his running mates Trey Donaldson gets loose Hes into double figures tonight All Donaldson does is score the basketball We mentioned 48 points in his two previous basketball games The kid puts his head down Hes just so good You think hes lefthanded as good as he is at finishing around the basket with that left hand Another Notre Dame turnover Serta with a bad pass And here comes Miami It has been all Hurricane since the break True Washington into the lane has it taken away I like the way these officials are letting them play You go down there and you want contact well theyre going to let you have it Theyre not blowing that whistle easily along those uh baseline or in that paint By the way Shrewsbury is out with three fouls And if Notre Dames going to hang in this game much like in the first half its probably going to come from the reserves Yeah their bench is fantastic Theyve outscored the opponents bench in 13 of 16 games this year They had a huge advantage in the first half of this one Big collision Tout is holding his head as he and Shelton Henderson came together Well I cant afford to lose Tout Hes one of their best rebounders He led the nation in rebounding a year ago One of the top rebounders in the ACC Lets hope this young man can put himself together and come back and finish this game So basketball play common foul play on And I do think the base that music tout set perhaps played into that Yeah you you had mentioned you caught that when youre setting a screen generally you cant make your feet spread them wider than the width of your shoulders and how it was really extremely probably twice that So you as you said it it played into it and uh Henderson wasnt hit with that flagrant foul So just a comment on Henderson and the best news is that Tout stays in the ball game able to play on number 33 and White for the Fighting Irish who are still looking for their first made bucket here in the second half It was tied 39 apiece at the break Its been a 101 start for the U Now Notre Dames in a bit of a pickle Shot clock at five Double teamed in the corner Sera lost it Here comes Miami with numbers Allen finds Donaldson Got it Thats pretty basketball You get the double team in the corner Get the ball to the center You get the kick out to the wing And Donaldson like I said hottest fish grease right now offensively knocks down the triple It has been all Kes here in the first part of this second half Yeah the Irish just shooting themselves in the foot in the second half They have twice as many turnovers as shot attempt 0 for two from the floor now One for three as Carolson gets him back on the board That is a good looking freshman right there Got that ball right into the heart of the Canad defense and delivered a plucking Allen into the corner Donaldson this time doesnt get the roll And Tout looked like he discarded U Who did they get for the foul I think theyre going to get it on Ta He cant believe it Hes got his arms up But Uday is like wrestling a live gator and you got to do everything you can Look at U Allen in that double team right there to kick ahead there Thats that 125 that J uh Lucas is talking about in transition Get it to the middle then kick it outside to the perimeter Look at No Renu working it inside there for a hard fought bucket How many times has this young man gone inside in the paint for buckets inside I think Ive count four or five of Well one of the men hes battling Tout picked up his third foul there He stays in Shrewsbury with three fouls as well Back in And theres a reach in foul against Drew Washington the junior from Phoenix out of Arizona Compass Prep who transferred after a couple of years at New Mexico where last year he was honorable mention all mountain West Conference Yeah he can play Hes got speed that uh not most people have on that basketball floor that can play under control So Jay Lucas as much as he is a defensive mastermind coach he literally lets his guys get out and run in transition Frost had a big first half off the bench Catch and shoot No Tout a masterful rebounder Misses the put back Mohamed then with a rebound And if thats on Ude Uday now with four personal fouls Hes got Were talking about him being an alligator down there Well how hes no slouch himself He got on the offensive glass He averages three and a half offensive rebounds a game And he was able to keep that thing alive and draws the fourth personal foul now on U And hes going to have to go out They were not the same team in the first half with U on that bench Heres Sir Mohamd who had such a big first half May have just gotten away with a travel He gets two points instead They dont call traveling any wars do they You know that Teach me how to douge baby Thats why hes going inside Uses that dance move and gets a bucket Trey Donaldson is a tremendous closer He just keeps coming after you Kids a winner Wanted Michigan won a conference championship in the Big 10 at Michigan sliding back down to Florida And hes doing the same thing that he did for the Wolverines now that hes doing for the game and he started 37 games last year for Michigan at the point for a team that went to the Sweet 16 but the Irish just continue to cough it up Cant make crosscourt passes against the Canes They are just too quick They move so well in the passing lanes Doesnt matter if its Allen or Washington Everybody gets into the passing lane 15th turnover committed by Notre Dame Hey this thing was tied at half and all of a sudden the Canes are up by a dozen and it has happened fast Look at the turnover 156 They have turned over Notre Dame 15 times And that was the biggest concern when we asked Coach Drewberry about this Miami basketball club So can they rely Notre Dame on their half court defense to get them back into the game Thats their calling card Logan IMS right now who is their best on ball defender trying to stay with the ball carrier the ball handler Drew Washington able to get into the lane See how crafty he was at splitting that double team though He was going right to the basket Actually it was Trey Donaldson I beg your pardon So Donaldson able to get through that double team Now he inbounds 10 of the timer Out of every timeout it seems like the ball finds number five in Green Yeah they do a nice job making sure that they at least get a the ball into the hands of Renew down there in that painted area Oh Renew got away with a foul How about Brady Kaylor the freshman from Fisers Indiana right spot at the right time It was like one of those foosball games It bounced off a couple guys and right into the hands and he was able to put it in the bucket and boy did they need a basket They have really been struggling to get field goals here in the second half Theres that defense from I on the deflection and its Notre Dame with the steal That just I I I think hes so big so strong Hes got to attack the basket with more power when he gets it in that paint Kayla looks to hand it off Shrewsbury well defended on the perimeter by Drew Washington I gets free Five on the shot clock Here goes Kaylor Unable to get it up on the rim before the buzzer but play goes on How about the halfcourt defense by the Canes right there Renew sets the screen for Henderson Catch and shoot Allen off the back iron Long rebound tracked down by Renu Washington Sundre got a piece and weve got bodies flying once again This kid Allen is relentless at going on the glass back to South Bend right after this Back into Coral Gables I think they put him on one of the two buses they got out there in the loading dock Make him have to drive back to uh South Beach or Coral Gables as you as you say But uh well as our crew has shown there are a lot of IU fans here in the building Were not that far from Bloomington And of course there are some Hurricanes fans as well showing their colors I like been signetti together Those guys seem like theyre on the same page Theyre dialed in I cant see how they beat the Theres a good stop right there Notre Dame needed something positive happened out of that timeout break You got to Its a 10point game It wasnt like Kurt Kanees have put this thing to bed A lot of time to play Obviously Sundra lost the handle able to resecure it Nearly 9 minutes gone here in the second half Notre Dame and Miami were tied at halftime I coughed it up again Thats been the one hiccup for him I think hes played a really good game except for all the turnovers which are so uncharacteristic on the held ball The possession arrow points to Notre Dame So the Irish keep it not another turnover But youve got to take care of the basketball Yeah he had four in the first half Hes got one already here in the second half for a total of five I think this kid had five turnovers on the season coming in this thing He is generally a sure ball handler The lob to tout tried to save it unable to do it Thats a dangerous pass from the other side of the court for the freshman Harelson Can I give Tal some credit there He knew there was no way he could save that ball to one of his teammates So he just carried it out of bounds with him Now it gives uh the Irish a chance to set their defense at the other end rather than giving the Canes a breakaway So much for that but its a its a great point what you made Well I see so many young players that throw it over their heads and it leads to an easy run out Well the ACC player of the week is really heating up Trey Donaldson with 11 points in the second half for a total of 17 Kaylor rattles in the three Well they needed it Couple buckets now They got a stop and they got another bucket there So maybe it took the Irish a little while to warm up in that first half and then they had a nice run to end the half and get a little momentum Theyve been half stepping out of the locker room again here in this second half Maybe they can pick it up here and finish the game in the last 10 minutes I check that Washington was the last one to score for Miami Donaldson is on the bench Renew from the corner Notre Dames defense holds again Theyve trailed by as many as 12 Yeah Virginias got six field goals All of them have been in the paint Why He wants to shoot a three right there is beyond me as theyre not able to secure that defensive glass We can give the Irish another opportunity But here comes the reigning ACC player of the week back into this basketball game Look at his numbers in the first half Six points on two of four shooting In the second half hes been fantastic Nine points on four of six driving that thing hard to the rack here in this second half has given the him and his teammates a nice start to the second half And we talk about his scoring so much but oh by the way he averages nearly seven assists per game Second best in the league Hes got the four tonight along with three steals is always very disruptive Did you see this kid in Michigan I I dont remember him in Michigan playing this well Its something hes found here with coach Lucas that has him playing on another level Well Coach Lucas was telling us this morning Scott that Donaldson is allowed to be either one or 1A with Miami whereas Michigan they played inside out with those two sevenfooters music last year Did it so well that they made it to the Sweet 16 but uh Michigan changed its roster Donaldson was looking for something different and he has found it at Miami Yeah And lucky for Ma Miami it was the kid from North Carolina Carolina Cadau that went to Miami and Donaldson decided he was going to take off But how about that follow there by T He has a nice job leaving no doubt at going to the basket on that put back jam First two points go on the highlight reel The follow slam make it a sevenpoint ball game They just grabbed Alunis as he came out to set a pick and roll Thats going to be the fifth excuse me they got the fourth team foul out on the Irish But how about a cout Three and a half offensive rebounds a game by following up his teammates misses You got the headband the curly blocks But if youre Miami youve got to know where he is Youve got to block that guy out every single time Said you got to put a body on him right You got to you got to kp know your personnel You got to know this guys going to the basket on every uh shot You got to put a body on and try to keep him off that board Look at those numbers But the big number for him now as he goes out with those four fouls Lot of time left in this ball game Nine minutes Alunas lost it on the way up It went up and over the backboard Hes looking for a foul call but the officials say Nope you just lost it Yeah youre not buying what hes selling I was just saying a big fell at 270 lbs Got to attack the rack with more power but uh you put two hands on that basketball when you go there He might have got slapped a little on the right wrist but when youre 270 its kind of like playing against Shaquille ONeal right Those little blows they dont call you almost have to jump on his back to get a whistle And Alis has got to realize I have to play with more power and be more secure with that ball when Im going to the basket Harold many run here by the K uh by the Irish Harrelson trying to take advantage of that size He does very well in that booty b uh booty ball style of using his size to back down a defender Its something that drew him to Micah Shrewsbury He saw what coach Shrewsbury did at Penn State with a couple of guys that made it to the NBA He wanted to do the same thing along with the family atmosphere that he felt here Why Jaylen Harelson chose Notre Dame over Indiana Yeah And Im watching this game here It has been a better looking Irish defensive effort the last few minutes They are keeping the Canes on the perimeter Have have stopped all that interior scoring and theyre not theyre not scoring from the outside Little turnover inside by Altunis A couple out long shots that havent found the range and we got ourselves a sevenpoint game That was the second foul on Dante Allen the freshman from Miami Ross sets the screen now Gets the ball back Puts it up Way off the mark cheering Donaldson right down the lane Gets the defense up in the air and draws the foul So good with that ball Its like hes got it on a string and its a yoyo draft Yeah I like I like Peterson Give me Peterson or De you flip a coin between Deansa and Peterson for the number one pickling draft There you can see it right there The top five NBA prospects Peterson the band But Boozer who I like at Duke my guy Caleb Wilson I I predicted he was only be a one and done at Carolina And then uh Brown Jr there at Louisville Uh those guys could flat out get it done cheering I got a couple freshman on there Yeah So you get youve got the top two projected out of the Big 12 but the next three are from the ACC Lots of an talent an infusion of talent this year that has helped to elevate the Atlantic Coast Conference from where its been the last couple of years Two free throws from Trey Donaldson And Miami embodies that And I was going to say one thing about the ACC Conference I talk about the Big 12 but the ACC conference 14 of cheering the 18 teams now and the top 75 net ranking So and that that number was half that a year ago at this time Shrewberry Harelson does a nice job to gather and lay it in Oh what a pass along the baseline I was just saying Shrewberrys got to give him something Just three points uh in this basketball game No offensive rebounds Hasnt done much defensively Miami Hurricanes been blowing past him And then he finds his his buddy along the baseline The true freshman delivers a big puck Donaldson doesnt get the roll Shrewsbury the coachs son dribbles up Looking for a three as he always does It was halfway down Oh my goodness I dont know if that ball could have gone further in the basket without going in A good look by Shrewsbury Just couldnt get by the race Just one three on the day Dante Allen down the lane and he was fouled This kid Allen just puts his head down like hes got a football mouthpiece and a chin strap on and takes it hard to the wreck time and time again Well this kid is fearless Hes a freshman Hes 64 220 And Scott you commented during shoot around today that this Miami basketball team looks like a football team Yeah Im not sure who the football coach is for the Miami Hurricanes but much like coach Freeman lent a player over here to coach Shrewberry I think that maybe the Miami football coach might try to grab some of these basketball players for next season Why not Can you be seen Henderson as like a middle line inside middle linebacker Jaylen Harelson 67 220 Again just a freshman cheering One out of two at the line for Dante Allen rebound so far tonight 3325 Fighting Irish Miamis only outrebounded been outrebounded three times this year 11th in the nation in rebounding coming in tonight Yeah and they got crushed on the glass offensively in that first half Time and time again they were getting second third and fourth opportunities really added to their uh rebounding totals Logan IMS got himself into a tough spot and coughs it up Here comes Malik Renu down the lane and the lefty was fouled He just took that basketball at 69 240 lbs coast to coast the way old Magic Johnson used to do it back in the 80s with the Showtime Lakers Fourth foul on Garrett Sundra So Malik Renu who spent the last three years playing for Mike Woodson at Indiana University as you mentioned before twice Honorable mention all Big 10 Over a000 points in his IU career now in the green orange and white of the U Look at those numbers there in steals 12 for the U just four for the Fighting Irish And that has been just devastating to the Irish the fact that they get those steals live ball turnovers and they get going the opposite direction And they dont score they get to the free throw line And of their poor free throw shooters Reneu is not one of them He shoots nearly 80 from that free throw line Look good on those two And the lead is back to 10 6353 Miami cheering Mohamd scoreless in the second half until now Big first half and the sophomore banks it in Much like Allen uh hes got a a good knack of being able to put that thing down on the floor with the strong right hand dribble and get inside that uh area below the free throw line where he has found much success on the evening 15 for Mohamed Heres Allen left alone and he makes Notre Dame pay Well the former NBA kids right now are doing it on both ends Malik Allens son on one end Nazi Mohamds kid on the other just trading baskets Here goes Nazis kid Got himself in a tough spot there And its another Notre Dame turnover Number 18 on the night Donaldson off the hesitation works his way into the lane and he is called for travel Yeah they got that for the same sort of thing earlier in the first half and as a player you got to love this consistency by this officiating group I think Ive mentioned it a few times Theyve done a wonderful job dragging that pivot but theyve been all over that Thats been the call to shore And uh another turnover now for Miami And again 5 minutes 15 seconds to play A lot of time for the Fighting Irish to come in here and still try to steal this game So both bigs are now back into the game to play with four personal fouls Who can stay out there longer Ernest Uday for Miami or Carson Tout for Notre Dame two of the top three rebounders in the ACC Im if I had a bet Im going to say U is going to foul out He seems like hes been a little off all night long and I think hes going to be the one thats going to foul out of this thing Shrewberry gets to the basket Well thats what Shrewberrys got to do right like he you just cant bomb away from the outside and set to find your your rhythm out there on that perimeter You got to get something going to that basket get to that free throw line to have that visualization of that ball going through the hoop And now his next outside jump shot be will probably be true Pat Driscoll the baseline official with a foul call off the ball Its on Jaylen Harelson Yeah thats seven Thats going to be seven Excuse me make that nine team fouls now on the Irish So another opportunity for Henderson to go to the line Its been a kind of a mystery for this young fella at the free throw line up 60 free throw shooter And if youre Jay Lucas are you happy about being in the double bonus now with your Miami team 16th out of 18 teams in the ACC from the line at 68 Yes if you got the right guys going to the line right like if you can keep U and Henderson off the line and get the ball uh into the hands of Don Donaldson and youll be youll be just fine But if you got the big guys going to the line yeah youre going to give the opportunity for the Irish to cut into that deficit Well Hendersons only 54 but to me his shot is not broken Theres no reason he cant make a higher percentage than that Yeah with with a lot of bigs too right Its just confidence You make them in practice and then when the popcorn starts popping and the lights get bright your confidence dips and youre not as confident going to the line and you miss the short arm it going to be called for the foul Trying to cut off Jaylen Harelson And now Haroldsons going to go to the line An excellent free throw shooter and shooting the front end of a one and one That is the seventh team foul on Miami Well you know the officials havent blown their whistles a whole lot Ive commented on how they let him play Like the black the Big 12s more of a you know black and blue division I I hope we dont get a whole lot of whistles this last 4 and 12 minutes This game has been too good Now Harelson has just about reached his season average He is the fifth leading freshman in terms of scoring in the ACC He and Shelton Henderson both have played just about to their average They have been very comparable so far this year and again here tonight Yeah they make these kids different I think when I was a freshman I may might have averaged cheering five points a day Now these kids come in and they average kid Boozer averaging 22 Caleb Wilsons up over 17 18 A couple guys out here you know they are ready to perform when they step onto this uh fight stage Well this has been one of the best freshman classes in the country in years Five to shoot a step back jump shot that is 43 Shelton Henderson with just his eighth made three on the season Give him 17 points tonight Hes just showing off Well he had all those jams early on Started the game with four jams inside and then now hes stepping out in the second half and knocking in triples Nice job to break down the Miami defense keep the ball moving and get the layup for Tout off the feed from Shrewberry Yeah And Renew is like how did he get that in I I had my hand on the ball That kid was just too big too strong He was able to power through that block shot Still put the ball on the basket Thats where you want the Canes to be You want to chip into that late Theyre not a good threepoint shooting team as a whole Serta inserted into the lineup for some offense And he goes right to the rack Backto back buckets inside And Donaldson slow to get up Im not sure whats bothering him if its his wrist or its his knee But Coach Lucas go get a timeout Look at his star player music Well Shelton Henderson is back in the NC2A tournament We got We beat him by two uh up in the Medallands but unfortunately your Syracuse Orangeman or Orange as theyre now called got us the next night Kept us out of the final four That was a great game Never enjoyed my time in New Jersey more than that night Thats one of those games I just want to forget We were so good 87 with Kenny Smith and Joe Wolf a freshman JR Reed All right Miami with the basketball up by nine Three minutes to go Theyve led by as many as 12 The Irish need to get stops and they need to get some buckets at the other end Malik Renu going to work with three on the shot clock Gets over that right shoulder left it short and there to get the rebound The ball must have grazed the rim Shelton Henderson with the rebound Officials are saying that ball grazed the front end of the rim And Henderson whos not a great offensive rebound what a timely oh boy cheering Inside they go And what a masterful job by Miami on that possession to chew up clock and get a layup by Malik Renu They really did just get a major body blow to the Irish on that possession Shrewsbury makes 50 of his corner threes None bigger tonight than that one I hate to say Im right but I called it He go inside for a bucket and then the next outside shot generally finds the range Happens at every level high school college and in the pro When youre struggling you young people out there take the ball to the rack See Shrewsbury now with 200 career made threes Another kick ball right there A couple Iris trying to get to that pocket pass Not let Renew roll down the lane Kick that ball Out of time Minute 47 They can get a stop here Something good can happen for the Irish at the other end And with that kick the shot clock is reset back to 20 So thats another 11 seconds Miami gets to drain this clock which is down to 145 Yeah And I think coach Locus wants him to drain a lot of it and hes going to bring the ball back out here and go pick and roll with Donaldson and renew Now Donaldson says Im going to work on Shrewsbury myself He gets a little 10ft shot flips it up and in He waved off the screen and said Let me do it myself A little push shot with the right hand right in front of the basket Well he is the ultimate closer 19 points for him Harelson banks it in Give him 16 Hes been fantastic Few rebounds as well But they got to start getting some turnovers They got to turn the chains over here Dante Allen is fouled in transition by Cole Serta You know Trey Donaldson is one of those guys one of those rare guys who when the game is on the line his heart rate does not change He is a cool customer and even more so in the final couple of minutes And so now at the free throw line will be Dante Allen Yeah 68 shooter So obviously they got to try to extend this game right Just a little over a minute to play Youre down by eight So try to send one of these guys to the line and hope that maybe they can miss two or maybe only make one of two as they are now and then shoot the um the double bonus here Two free throw shots the rest of the game Ernest U Jr is at the scorers table He has had a limited role for Miami tonight because of foul trouble Allen gets the first replaces Renu a little offense defense there right by coach Lucas hes been taught by the by the best of them get your big rebounder shot blocker your rim protector back in this basketball game Carolson Shrewsbury Berry got a good shot Now Serta goes back out to the threepoint line Under a minute to play Harelson gets a layup but it took an awful lot of time to get those two points Timeout called Its an eightpoint game Ways to watch and listen to the biggest game of the year The Hurricanes football team six days away from playing for a national title basketball team now 48 seconds away from a 10th consecutive win Yeah if youre uh the fighting average right now you want to try to get the ball in the hands of a young freshman and see if you can get him on the free throw line but they do not I think its going to be true Washington going to the line here Oh take that back Donaldson they got the ball to the hand of Donaldson at the free throw line Well he is 76 at the line coming in Played for Bruce Pearl for a couple of years at Auburn Last year for Dusty May of Michigan Big 10 champs is a cucumber just as he does in winning time Its exactly what Coach Lucas Im glad you said that winning time Because Coach Lucas told us this morning hes the guy that wants the ball in his hands at the end of the game So to see him go to LA uh the free throw line tow that stripe and knock it down not quite surprised he was able to make both of those free throws Harelson puts it up Canes get the rebound And now Notre Dame down by 10 will not foul Oh my goodness The Irish they fought so hard in that first half but just could not get it going here in the second half Theyre going to drop their third consecutive game in their fourth of the last five right now Trending the wrong direction Got a held ball So no basket Drew Washington didnt like the call He wants the two points He wanted the two points but it looks like they were just trying to get that shot up So the game clock shot clock wouldnt expire before the game clock but its still only 5 seconds for for them to shoot So I wouldnt be surprised if Jay Lucas just say Hey lets just take a turnover here Get this to get on the get to the showers Maybe not Maybe Donaldson will say Let me add to my point total Im the ACC player of the week baby 23 points five assists for Donaldson Miami has its 10th straight win the longest winning streak for the program in eight years
