in the conference Ian Jackson absolutely Ian Jackson getting the job done over 20 points per game in ACC play and now a fixture in the starting lineup no way Hubert Davis can take him out and sit him on the bench petrius and the Bears here in the front Court coko the big fellow the transfer from Michigan State and petrius with the opening possession and this is Javon blackshire Jr on the attack Campbell the three from the right long rebound pus Bears right back at him Runner by Campbell is up and good so far and thats the thing theyve got to be worried about its a small team I think hbert is gone with a small team its been good for him but youre going to give up some offensive rebound and Cy averages over 12 offensive rebounds per game and its rare that you ever come into the dean East Smith Center and find a team thats a better offensive rebounding team than the tah Hills however thats been the case often this year heres jayen Washington the hero of Saturday over sasoko on the jump shot door we watched J Watch work on that with Shawn may earlier today and looks very comfortable now catching in his opportunities in the post and he has to be with all these little guys out here he has to be a presence from now they need him inside loocking shots rebound blacker uses the Soko screen against Powell and knocks down the jump shot javons only had one double figure game in his last five that was the 15 had it Clemson on their first trip East this year and C up by Applause basket Davis and now heres Jackson with his first touch over sto yakovich and knocks it down the captain is in the building early he made every shot in practice today every play they ran he made every one and he started out the same way tonight coach ban un West both were were a little surprised when I told you that as a young player he did not shoot the basketball well hes a guy thats reallyy a lot of work in on the jump shot but you can see the work is pay it all look at this pow the link to the floor transition coach talked about that today you have to get that Martin mson red hotted his team after a three and a layup Applause Music Applause Applause Applause well Mark Madson red hot at his own club here Cory because two things he talked about today take a look at Jackson every time he gets a catch and make sure you get back in defensive transition he had his team in the Huddle he asked him whats the keys to winning and they one was to not allow 11 to get three secondly transition defense and youve seen two examples of that execute the Perfection but its all heels but you talk about that and then you know its players you know but coach the players actually answered the question so they knew they knew the answers to the test you got to get back you got you got to be able to get back and theres a turnover at the post Carolina running again heres Powell on another scoop and Campbell collects but coach this is a team when you think about the cow bears that does not handle the basketball extremely well theyre a30 on the season and they have a a higher turnover rate than assist so this is the last team you want to do that against correct you cant let them get transition there goes theyre talking about transition but its easy to talk about very hard when you come into this building and get your team to get back its not easy driving basket by kadoo tar Hills return to a threepoint lead theres a fallway from blackshire and once again if Carolina can make Cal take those shots theyre going to have success because those are tough shots to be able to go up against individual theyve got to find a way to get the basketball in the painted area floater from Davis and Campbell whos got two quick field goals for Cal and heres sto yakovich and Ian Jackson Defender double team help from Washington well they want it out of sto yakovich his hands well and again sto yakovich went to the back down but he doesnt really have much of a size advantage over Jackson jackon can hold his own Campbells got four already for the Bears and hes got the ball with the clock winding down and the long to spin out tough shots you dont like to do that in here Washington tees up another one at 16 ft thats the area where he is can be so much better for Carolina has the ability to stretch the flo even Beyond a threepoint Arc but yet the hit one this season there goes Andre to the rack layup falls off Soko battles and a foul going to be called here patris out from under the basket and the foul is going to be on Kau itll be his first first on the tar Hills we get a timeout in Chapel Hill Carolina by Music three take that out of the loop and you get the gamewinning dunk with 24 seconds left and the game preserving block at the horn from Jaylen Washington Jim you talked a moment ago taking the next step hes going to be an important piece if they continue to have success with the four guards or the four little guys so how big a step is that in your mind for he has to do that and a little more if theyre going to be successful moving forward Cory said the guards are little guards theyre not six four or five theyre 6 foot 6 foot and theres a three by sto yakovich it bounds away and Ian Jackson puts Carolina in the front Court V Allen Luben into the lineup now junor from Orlando Davis tried to get it back to Luben turned over sto yakovich the other way to be Jackson and Ian touched it last and that great Hands by Ian Jackson that one may have gone off the story too close I mean and Ian was looking over at Matt Potter to see look at thats the angle hard to see from that one but great Hands by Ian Jackson and one of the things that Huber Davis talked to us about was he can be an elite Defender his athleticism is off the chart and hes got good size at about 6 big play Jeremiah Wilkinson had his shot rejected Seth trembles come on the floor by the way during the timeout for Drake Powell in the Carolina order and heres kdo out front for three standing three for Elliot C just his 13th of the Year much much improved this year shooting the basketball from outside is made some big shots none bigger of course than the one at not today huge but when he makes shots its a different team sto yakovich at three bounds away the rebound cadell ahead for Jackson in transition lay up there hes really good not just pretty good really good and the one thing you dont want to do is get in a foot race with and Jackson once he gets a step its going to be tough to be able to contain him but I love the way that he has really just fit in and has found a rooll here in this starting lineup SE Trumble now coming back off the bench well see how hes able to respond travel is going to be the call on Joshua Ola Joseph second turnover on Cal in the ball game and this is when youre thinking North Carolina basketball then Allen L coming up with the denial and then Elliot gadoo stepping back when you go underneath the screen youre forced to shoot it but this is UNC basketball his best getting out in transition Ian Jackson with the finish and we see the zone defense turn over yeah Kad was trying to fire it I think the tremble cows missed their last six shots from the floor almost 6 minutes in they Trail eight stoyanovich without a basket so far well and you know and once again hes got the assignment of having Seth Trimble their best perimeter Defender defending him I tell what campells been able to find some success especially when hes gotten into paint yeah six for DJ Campbell by the way transfer from Western Carolina out to the Cal program he played for Justin Gray last year in CAE theres Kau on the shot hes got seven ellot Kad had Four Points 11 assists Saturday in Raleigh and hes already got seven here tonight he usually is not a threat and he looks like he wants to be tonight and that again RJ hasnt been getting as many opportunities this year because of Jackson and kodo a little bit more aggressive too heres Wilkinson the Mis jumper Ola Joseph inside and scores with the right hand Ola Joseph is springy inside right there not only going after the offensive rebound but also the good back showing off his athleticism in the pain Carolina by six couple of former Vanderbilt teammates here Luben and Dort and so youre saying theyve done that before huh for stock house last year another of course North Carolina Legend So those two guys probably did that in practice a few times a little 101 afterwards they showing it off here in Chapel Hill heres dor right back to workas like a big man drill in Music City dork trying to turn with a left hand with the glass call it please hes said 11 right now coach he and Luben going at it lead door is 610 listed at 245 from Dallas theres the drive by Jackson got knocked away recovered after sto yakovich touched it Carolina with a fresh 20 heres RJ Davis teeing up his first three of the night twoo strong thats his first shot of the Night by the way as well and were almost 8 minutes in but regardless as to the success of Ian Jackson RJ Davis is still going to remain priority number one on any opposing team Scouting Report so hes denied offer more so on the perimeter Campbell to jump shot trle the rebound and look at Davis fight for it saves for kdo back for tremble in traffic draws the foul and well step aside free throws for the tar Hills when we come back Carolina by six in Chapel Hill Music new shoes thats right Converse and Im not sure if he has a deal with Converse or not I would suppose that he does if hes handing out free convert to to his to his teammates but but it shows the type of character he is and again hes new theyre all new there theres 11 new roster players on the cow bench and we consider the fact that its Nike School however Converse is owned by Nike so its still okay to give Converse top thats right triple hits both free throws by the way those Converse by the way almost look like the ones Bon played in well you n999 dont go there but coach youll remember this for a very long time especially under D Smith this was a huge Converse most people were most people yeah Chuck Taylor Chuck Taylor out of the corner heres Ola Joseph on the drive he bounced it off Jaylen Withers to keep possession for the Bears with seven to shoot theres an interesting book coming out Sunny the Carols got a book coming out in February about Legends and souls about his signing up 84 coaches or Nike which changed the face of how sneaker companies did business and uh itll be interesting read Id say so Suns got a lot of stories and Mark Matson and Pat Driscoll in discussion here and the guy called The Mad Dog well and again seeing this live action you felt like it did go off of Ola Joe but he tries to throw it out but he actually dribbled the basketball out of bounds prior to getting there and it also goes off him so two separate turnovers car the ball F was coming together and getting it correct RJ Davis at three spins off sooko the rebound a foul on Luben thatll be the first on Luben the second on Carolina dont forget we got a triple header for you on acc Network coming up on Saturday 200 well get you started presented by food line deacons and hokes from blackburg and 400 off to Syracuse for the Irish and the orange and well finish in Raleigh these Golden Bears meet Kevin Keats and the Wolfpack who were in Black B later tonight 600 start on acc Network and of course always available for you on the ESPN app the second leg of this trip for the cow bears and in my opinion coach WD I think they should have been here for the last two to three weeks when youre not in class its the best time for both Cal and Stanford coming from the west coast to stay here and play four to six games sure and make it just an extended road trip everybody wants to be in the NBA so make it an NBA type experience him the drop thats his first field goal its a whole lot better than back and forth three times thats for sure yeah Cal and Stanford are both schools on the quarter system by the way for folks who dont know how that works a little later start to the beginning of the fall campaign thus the spring semester as well and they dont go back to class until next week and so this is the third full week of ACC conference action and this is a time where they could have just spent on the East Coast heres withs off the stea oh my jayen just Saks the dunp down with two hands largest lead of the half for the Tar Heels at 10 coach thats the guys whose minutes been effective more so than anyone with a smaller lineup as David Withers and I think it was the right move because they theyre just more effective offensively with the guards and he hasnt been able to score so it puts two nons scorers in the game with him and in the big gu so its I think its a good move but if youre Hubert Davis and again youve been through this of course 47 years along the sidelines as a head coach how do you manage the personalities and the expectations of guys who were starters and now have to come off the bench its tough thats not easy and hes a guy that is thinks he should be starting which every player should thats a good player um thats part of coaching part of how you handle your players but thats not easy when you demot a kid who but you know they struggled early in the year they were struggling to score and now they get Jackson in their full time in the last five or six hes averaging 23 points a game I mean you have to go with that guy kads the point guard and RJs the off guard I mean theyre small theyre going to get H hurt inside a little bit but its still a very effective transition offensive basketball team and my bigger concern with them is RJ just hasnt shot the ball well this year and you look at this game the two best players are 0 for eight right now petrius couple of free throws here he got one of two Carolinas had seven guys score not one of them is named RJ Davis a Jims Point tar Hills with a ninepoint lead the foul by the way down at the other end was on tremble its his first just the Third on Carolina so you got Withers Washington kadu tremble and Captain Jack on the floor and CAD lobed it to nobody I think you thought somebody was cutting to he thought it was going to be Jayla Washington but give Campbell a lot of credit for getting over and taking away the lane to Washington to be able to go but thats a scenario where for K just get a shot up on the glass allow Jay was to have an opportunity to go get the offensive rebound pal touched it last itll stay with the Tar Heels and heres Trimble on the catch with eight to shoot working against blackshire Seth into traffic oh what a tricky move on the score for tremble but he did that the entire nonconfidence and Maui when they were there he was the best player for North Carolina on the island and so when you consider another young man who is you know caught demoted to the bench coming off its going to be interesting to see how he develops in this new role especially after coming back in injury lead is 11 here now for Carolina as we work toward 9 Minutes in this first half shot clock at five and Reus petritis Ola Joseph the three and rings the bell he needed that one ol Josephs giving them good minutes off the bench coming in and the offensive rebound put back now knocking down to three there goes CAD treding to get it back to Washington hell save it for Jackson he a pull up at 16 ft is good seven for Ian Jackson I love the relationship between he and Yuber Davis coach talk to us about every night 1230 am he gets a text message from Captain Jack saying coach did I get better today what can I do to make this team better and make myself better as an individual and of course could no coach asleep so rest hes up to one yeah they they have some dialogue late night this gives him something to do Washington in the corner for Withers and thatll be an offensive foul but try to stepped in front Jaylen Withers commits his first itll be the fourth on the Tar Heels and thatll get RJ Davis back into the ball game for Carolina for Trimble and Andre sto yakovich for the go the Bears coach outside of Buddy and Jimmy any of your players ever coach ever text you at 1230 am the only one was Paul Harris he used to text me at 2 or 3 in the morning cuz he was still up and I said you know we do have a game good we do have a game come on get to sleep toy hovic trying to find his way to the basket put it up in traffic sasoko the stick back sokos got six hes had two double figure rebound games this year including one against Virginia but a half dozen points is heavy work in the scoring column for mty and theyre all Second Chance buckets and theres cell adding to his to but you can see Cal daring Kad to shoot the basketball they continue to go under the screens even at the free throw line making him have to be a scorer and not a distributor soos had four double figure games this year back to work again He travel that time and money comes up hbling here a little bit thatll get us to a Timeout on Ks fifth turnover well patrus found Joshua Ola Joseph who knocked down the three for the Bears and then Ian Jackson has got seven in the first half for the Music heels struggle tonight first lets go with Andre sto yakovich well sto yakovich has when youre at top of the charts on The Scouting a lot of attention is paid to you and you can see everyone in the white jerseys paying attention to St yakovich and everyone in the arena paying attention to Ian Jackson Elliot Kau getting up three as well off to a good start offensively for him and again when North Carolina has this type of shooting theyre often able to be successful so sto yakovich is scoreless and sos RJ Davis for Carolina Jim yeah you know its its tough when you come into a place and youre a young player which St is and miss a couple then a guy hits a three on you you know you start the wheels start turn itll be interesting to see how he kind of recovers from that because he is a really good player Kate Tysons onto the floor for the first time tonight didnt play Saturday in the win at State theres a tear drop by Kau got his on rebound almost scored it and he and Blacker hit the deck hard but you can see Cal intent on making kadoo a score theyre taking away those passing lanes and forcing K to have to take the shot on his own and Dort just traveled again I think yep Ted Valentine to call from out at Mid Court six turnover on Cal by the way Cory you missed this earlier tearful reunion we had here uhhuh I mean the minute Ted Valentine hit the floor yeah hes cost me so many games he has to be nice to me now 30 years of being calls oh my God not everyone not everyone so he took off the first 17 he wasnt around for the first 17 it was the last 30 seems like 40 but seems like heres RJ Davis to step in two rattles off and Campbell the rebound and RJs gotten very good looks throughout this game so I mean again he cant complain about the looks hes got just unable to get him to go down RJs 0 for four here in this first half two of them from behind the threepoint line Campbell digs in again and look at Washington do a good job against Lee dor heres Davis knocking out on the bounce you know what would help RJ is either get to the free throw line or see a layup go through I mean regardless of how great of a player and score you are its always good to see it easy one go through for Good playmaking by him there absolutely and again hes in the top 10 in points and assists in the ACC RJ is a distributor hes not just a guy that scores points so hes going to make the right play hes got Washington some great looks four now for Jaylen Applause Washington 15 to shoot for sto yakovich five and a half to go in the first half Andre on the drive and the bump and the foul by uh Jaylen Washington and heres our cheerful reunion by the way just so you can get a look at you notice Im trying not to be Im trying to be nice yeah yeah you did great coach that that is different from the conversations that I used to see from you all when Im calling your games wbd let me tell you this during Co yeah coaches wearing masks yeah I go to Syracuse multiple times sure the second time I go my guy has on a clear mask and he was the best lip read as we see sto yakovich with his first bucket of the game get him going maybe my guy was the best lip read of all time on the sidelines when it comes to college coaches I never said this I thought the clear mask was intentional so they could still see what he was saying no it was it absolutely was that because again it wasnt just him hearing it you have to see it in the way that he was saying it to his players well there were no fans so you can hear it too not only Li you can hear it I was admonished every night when I got Applause home heres Davis now working on blacker boy Cs done a really good job of staying in front of RJ Davis in this first half Jackson with seven to shoot now heres Washington over dor and another jump shot for jayen Washington we talked about that today and Hs talking about him he can shoot shoot it h would lik him to shoot some threes Jim well thats a good lets go for 15 first and then lets move back from there but coach how about this how about when you have a game like jayen Washington had last time on his first double double the gamewinning bucket and gamewinning shot how much confidence does that give a player like Washington who has struggled at time throughout the season well you can see it tonight hes he thinks hes going to make it before he was shooting like he thought he might miss at the Tough dve by Kad Elliot kads got 11 in this first half now but again when you go out and have 11 assists in the game and team see okay he wants to get his teammates involved they often times force you to be a scorer and see if youre willing to take those shots Wilkinson another three Jeremiahs having a hard time averaging 12 and a half against the leag Jeremiah Georgia go so you got to imagine how big of a you know bucket list item this is to be able to play here in the dean absolutely knocked away from behind itll stay with Carolina we go to the under four were going to get substitutions both ways the tar Hills working on a 12point lead here in this first half against the Golden Bears of Music c and kdo is coming off a fourpoint 11 assist game on Saturday in righ by the way his 11 assist that was the second time this year hes had 10 or more assists in a game and heres tonights if you will time out for trivia question okay who was the last Carolina player M to have two games or multi games of 10 or more assists than a season and heres a guy that was born and brought up in no no no this is not historical and I will say this the answer is a player whos a colleague of ours at ACC Network oh well that be Joel Joe Mar why would you give away that thats an easy that was too big a hint yeah youre not stupid the answer is not Joe wow what okay Smart Guys Theo Davis right side tremble a triple and sto yakovich the backside rebound as they say well give you the answer at the next dead ball wait a minute is not Theo the answer is Theo okay I just said Theo you didnt just act like you didnt hear my answer well this is shocker because Theo didnt wasnt known for his passing by the way weve got ACC womens basketball double header tomorrow night butet crew by the way is in South Bend for Georgia Tech Notre Dame and thats followed by K and Duke and Durham right here on accn streaming live on the espnl flure the drive sasoko another rebound inside and the stick back over the Freshman Brown mty sokos got eight on his fourth field goal and now nine second chance points for Cal theyve been all over the offensive glass to six offensive board against Carolina car Heels by 10 Drake pal back on the floor James Brown is a freshman from Aurora Illinois and RJ Davis you know Jes Brown played for link last year of course with Trey Johnson who Cory getting the job done at Texas and Lear fylon at Alabama Elite backt so he hes used to playing with Elite back player y oh heres blackshire rolled it out of there Soko battles hell roll to the deck and look at RJ Davis fight gets the hell ball and the hell ball will go to Carolina on possession with 238 to play hey its not a scoring night so far for number four in the white but it is a hustle night its a make a difference night right let me tell you who loved that Hustle the guy on the sideline for the cow Bears Mark madon AKA Mad Dog he love that hustle right there he was all the way up to half court cheering on his guys aoko because at the end of the day that was an offensive rebound attempt it wasnt as though they didnt get a shot up and hes going after the basketball even though it it becomes a tie and loose ball H gets a possession arrow back to the bear coach heres your Zone by the way wait wait wait wait wait not his not your Zone but its a little different but its a Zone yeah I just said a zone Im sorry but no because Mark Madson came up today and said coach I wish I had your Zone thats true too and Davis tried to make the play to the slashing Jackson turned it over heres sto yakovich whos got just the single field goal back for a three by blacker and heres tremble running the floor two minutes to go in this first half and Carolina still with the 10point advantage Davis trying to weave through Jackson travel Carolina will turn it over thats their fifth of the first half so the Zone worked a couple times so its something you want to keep in back of your mind late game situations where it gets close you go back to it now coach on this end of the floor do you like the shots that cows getting yeah I mean its Carolinas defense is pretty good with stovich isnt scoring I mean they need him to be a good score and Carolinas doing a good job defensively I yeah tar Hills number one field goal percentage defense in conference play and also the number five scoring defense at conference play building a reputation at that end of the floor course well and thats the way they were successful two seasons ago when they went to the final four play in National Championship Game with hu Davis so you consider you know it is a priority for Coach Davis and his staff is not always executed by the guys on the floor tars just one of their last seven from the floor and were going to get a foul before the play inside and here are the numbers first first and T2 on blocks per game fouls on Kau by the way his second 16 foul so Elliot kads going to come out but I believe that the defensive numbers are by product of having smaller quicker guys on the perimeter that can actually get out and to guard their yard they can defend the basketball they dont have the same Rim protection that theyve had in the past but you got guys like Drake pow and Seth Trimble Ian Jackson on the floor you got three Elite Defenders on the floor heres Jeremiah Wilkinson freshman against freshman here with pal guarding and now Davis picks up S to shoot Wilkinson almost turned it over Soko rolls around to shoot oh a Joseph and one on the lop and foul that is winning basketball by Matty Soko getting on the floor after the loose ball which looked to be a fast break in Carolinas Direction you see the deflection but look where Soko comes from G in right running past the basketball as he Dives on the floor the presence of mind to get it to Ola Joseph who finishes through the contact and look at how his teammates are celebrating the effort Boko thats a gamechanging play you go from giving up two to having a chance to get three and it just keeps you close and thats what you want to do when youre on the world try to stay close hanging there with the te the threepoint trip Ola Joseph knocks it down hes got eight now in this first half you see the Bears extending their pressure the last time they did this they dropped back and went manto man now now looks like theyre going to stay in the zone defensively so Mark Masson trying to switch it up three ball D thats the way they get out of the Zone RJ Daviss 35th three of the Year Carolina back to a 10point lead with about a 2 and 12 second differential shot clock to game clock and WD I believe thats RJ Daviss 309th threepoint field goal of his career which is significant yes yes well show you the details here in a second and were going to get a turnover sto yovic trying to run it down hell recover against tremble and fire with Im not sure he knew that there was 10 shot on the shot and heres tremble on the run out and he lost it that was a disaster mostov thinking that the clock was running down had no idea he still had 10 seconds remaining on the shot clock fires from half court but the tar Hills end up giving it back off of the turnover Applause and ball in bouns to the Bears with 5 Seconds heres blacker Jaylen Washington out front and Blacker still fires an air balls one at the home I knew you were just going to say Tobacco Road found the Tobacco Road hard of course hes had hes had great game at Clemson yeah 30 at the Tigers but thats not tobacco rope not yet here is Campbell Bears trailing 10 we start this second half first meeting since late December 1998 Cal won the last meeting 7871 their only meeting in a series that dates back to 1972 look at the bo scores on that one My Guy Brad Frederick on the Carolina bench theres a little floater by black slapped out they chase it toward the bench Ian Jackson with a center kadoo back for the captain all the way to the basket Camp finish patrus the rebound contact there well Jackson comes up I think he felt that a little bit on the fall black here a three and slapped around again petrius one more pushes it up and off the window another offensive rebound adding to the second chance points down 112 advantage in the Bears favor eightpoint game minute gone second half RJ Davis just three points in the contest one for five from the floor and with him being one for five still the best shooting first half for the tar Hills this season Jackson Working on sto yakovich shot clock at three Davis from a way out and it will hit off the back rim Soko at the falling Applause rebound Drake Powell draws St yakovich here but and Drake pal the biggest of the guards in the starting lineup for the heel so matches up sizewise very well with sto yakovich and they made it difficult for him on the offensive end the floor the trus an air ball heres RJ Applause Davis Washington for Jackson petrius on the switch and kdo turned it over petrius and he will foul him on the drive and Rus petrius will get a couple of free throws on the third foul against Elliot Kad first on Carolina here in the second half you know and and again this is something thats really been an issue for ellot K all season long and especially off of scenarios like that I can remember one instance in Miami early in the michig I me Maui in the Michigan State game he got in foul trouble early but when the turnover happened there were guys in the crowd behind us yelling let him go let him go because they understand how important Elliot Capell is staying on the floor and now he has to sub out with the three foul yep and that brings tremble back into the lineup and now cookies are on the line if petrius misses this oh yeah and his shot doesnt look good either it looks good to Carolina fans who get cookies because of it and I am in on that my friends and layup by Washington goes bounding somebody make a basket here sto Yakov against tremble Andre boy really skilled Cory where he is on the floor thats a bad track they didnt need you dont need to Seth Trimble has to yakovich under control right there and you leave with stovich being able to see over Trimble where he doesnt have that size advantage over Drake pal and by the way the there we go Golden Bears on a run and then RJ Davis hit the floater hes got Applause five Al at outscored Carolina 4 nothing to start the half heres sto yakovich again double team back for Soko who will push it up and in every time you double team you leave that guy and you know its good strategy but its also not good strategy theyre doing a pretty good job straight up on St you may not need to double to heres St yovich against Jackson Ian right down the lane took the contact and will draw the foul second time hes taking a spill under the bucket here in the second half but we talked about the open to yakovich is more than a scorer hes a young man that can pass the ball extremely well you look at his size when Jayla Washington goes over hes watching the entire time dropped the dime to Soko once and then once again twice Matty sasoko now 12 points for him which I believe is a career high and hes been an offensive punch that Im sure the Bears werent expecting making the trip East so Jackson at the line sometimes a guy like Manny didnt get a lot of opportunities at michig state but he was learning one of the great coaches in the country you know hes working in practice so when he gets an opportunity now to play he can step up and show what he can do and hes a a really physical inside pres well and and how much of that has to do also with hes going up against Jaya Wason whos younger and not as strong to be able to contend with them in they but I mean Stak with a number of great passes even though hes not scoring hes still helping his team be successful well Carolina is going to have a problem in some games because of the bards you with this small of the lineup its just going to happen blacker theres Campbell on the lot for Soko one off his season High against Cornell follow away with the right hand luing the rebound for the tarel thats really what you dont want just get on the offensive blast get the guards moving get to the basket and get your stuff on the offensive blast heres Luben setting the screen Davis foul line leaves it for POW long three good Drake Pals got five and we talked about St yakovich lets give RJ Davis that same credit even though hes not scoring helping his teammates out with all the attention that he draws dropping D 11point lead for the tar Hills after Drake Powells 18th three of the Year petrius tries to answer canot heres Davis three on four slapped out of there from behind by DJ Campbell they to stay with Carolina Tar Hills with an 11point Music lead from outside RJ Davis touching the paint finding power on outside lining up the free ball knocking it down to stretch the lead for the hill national championship are you going to mention that last week when the three of us were together and I picked Notre Dame and Coach picked um Penn State I dont remember that of course you dont remember because you lost it is absolutely on tape I want to flag I want the red flag we can find it on ESPN plus flag stick back Ill get you poor folks out of this right here I please give me a review pal missed the two shots Carolina still got 11point lead and Blacker on the hard drive and Soko the dunk Soko has been a problem for the tar Hills 14 now from mon s but coach one of the things I love most is how when his offensive players are driving hes relocating himself to the open area to be able to catch and finish and hes much better doing that than trying to go oneonone down there hes much better finisher off the rebound or off the bounce pass Applause P there goes the drive on a score by Jackson through TP quarters Jackson is just way ahead of most stretch Men He nly Sho it he puts it on the floor and his defense has been really good as well Applause Campbell and the Bears try to Tempo down here a little bit trailing 11 again and Davis reached in calls that itll stay with Cal but a nice add by RJ Davis on the defensive side yeah RJs doing the other things yeah hes not scoring the basketball the way that he normally does but hes doing the other things getting in digging making sure that guys arent comfortable in the offensive end playing against him also Distributing the basketball Music heres sto yakovich over Powell back rim Miss and they Scramble for the loose ball hell ball is going to go to Carolina quick reminder to You full night of ACC womens basketball and tomorrow night its capped by nothing but net live from South Ben you see Justin Walters Hall of Fame coach Muffet McGraw Kelly gramlick Ivory lad will be there Thursday night 1000 following our double header right here on acc Network and the ESPN WD back

zone defense here again its work coach coming that to it so heres Luben now remember Washington over there on the bench sto yakovich is on the wing where Davis is ironically for to shoot look at the hard drive and shot by tremble that rattled out heres Andre sto yakovich whos still has just the two points in the ball game hell fire inside sasoko the catch and flush hes got 16 now that ties his career high from when he was in Michigan State against Kentucky back to a ninepoint Carolina lead the way hes playing right now doesnt look like hes going to slow down at all but now L coming in with the second chance opportunity giving Soko a little bit of a taste of his own medicine but Soko went for the block shot so as opposite big You got to crash the glass anytime the guy guarding you tries to block a shot there goes sto yakovich rejected by Luben unless theyre successful like mben has been for the second time in this game Jackson in the corner pow a shot fake Dr tried to feed V Allen he caught it and scored largest lead of the night now for the Tar Applause Heels 13point Advantage blacker heres Wilkinson from the corner and tremble had it and Pat Driscoll is going to whistle a foul here Ben Allen Lu getting the job done on both ends of the floor first the block shot denies dakovich at the rim and then showing off great hands this is a tough pass in tight quarters still able to gather it finish it and helping Carolina on both ends of the floor to build their largest lead of the game its funny we started this night talking about Jackson and sto yakovich as scores we should talk about them a little bit about what they do defensively too I think and Mark Matson tried to tell us today hey look sto yakovich might be our best on ball defense yeah I mean theyre defending that when you get your two best offensive players struggling I mean thats going to be a Difference Maker Carolinas just been able to overcome it with other guys and Cal hasnt Davis had that one to roll off the rim heres Wilkinson The Freshman Powder Springs Applause Georgia hes had a really nice debut in the ACC averaging almost 13 a game for the Bears in conference play yeah the leading scoring freshman for a player for freshman has not started a game this year 12 and 1 12 points per game and hes normally been instant offense for the Bears coming off the bench tremble against Applause blackshire heres RJ Davis for Wilkin to play over the top of the venell and Luben screen and Withers from the corner r on the thir oh when he makes shots like that yeah theyre a little different again RJ Davis making a good good pass pass good play youre not scoring do something else and and as Withers and been Al luin on the floor together now you can play the two bigs Carolina has the versatility to be able to do that especially when you consider defensively foul on Withers thatll get us to a break nickel dver on Withers 16point lead for the tar Hills in Chapel Hill Music flag earli this week broke the Freshman ACC scoring record 42 points for him I can remember when Harrison Barnes went for 40 in the ACC tournament against Clemson so and you know at Boston College theres going to be at least 2000 people drive down there from me well I I actually talked to Kelly flag last night Coopers mom and what the friends and family did believe it or not they bought they bought season tickets for Boston College games because there was cheaper to buy season tickets for the games than it would be to buy the one ticket for Duke crazy as that sounds that does sound crazy I believe it but theyre going theyre going to have the there will be more Duke fans at K Forum on Saturday night than Im sure well see no question Boston College Eagles fans Christen Tuckers foul on the drive by Trumble Tucker is a senior transfer out of Mesa Arizona played last year at Texas San Antonio and heres tremble at the line hes two for two in the first half has six tonight and the first free throw is good by the way they refresh the net our left during the break that net doesnt look uh doesnt look very giving want to tell you now the Smith Center maintenance folks here that was a that guy right there gets a little something extra in the check tonight absolutely Quick Change there I I didnt think he was going to get it going there was some doubt at the table about whether that would happen during the commercial break yeah Cory was all never never doubted it Carolina on a 9 nothing run after the free throws to make it an 18point game biggest of the night for the heels CS missed their last four and wedgie for Ola Joseph Cal cannot shoot threes and thats about all theyre getting in some some of these possessions you got to give Carolina Credit defensively theyre playing theyre playing good defense one of 17 from beond the AR for the cow Bears well struggle outside think they made their first one didnt they real early in the game all the Joseph was the only one thats made one for cow yep but Tris Fall Away against Trimble Miss over Bo been a hard night for Rus petrius since hes coming into the ACC his conference numbers have dipped down from where he was in the regular season transferred from Air Force he averaged 166 rebounds shot 49 from the floor 35 from three last year but the Step Up from the Mountain West coach into this league has been a little ruged you never know it step up some guys can make it probably have cant make it but you dont read about those guys too much well I tell you what air is different at Air Force though had training camp there twice with the Denver Nuggets let me tell you s 000 ft above sea level its hard to breathe up there shooting the basketball is different heres Campbell the other way for the Bears and theyre going to ticket him for the travel there so the turnover will give it back to Carolina and gives us a chance to tell you about the triple header on acc Network on Saturday Wake Forest at Virginia Tech at 200 presented by food line and Notre Dame is in Syracuse at 4 and well close the night for you in Raleigh Cal and NC State at 6 from the Lenovo Center all on acc network streaming live on the ESPN app now let me make sure I saw that correctly is Stanford playing at home this weekend I mean this week no no Stanfords here theyre at Wake Forest tonight and theyre here on Saturday against Carolina okay I thought they traveled together so it was okay yeah they they come east they dont necessarily play the same teams corre sometimes they swap sometimes they dont correct but theyre always on the East Coast at the same time that is correct well further east lets not say East coach yeah and dont get it confused with the trip to Dallas when both will play SMU at some point heres kadoo look at this little soft shoe in the lane and then miss badly on the jumper but look at how they continue to go under the screen even though youre only 10 ft away from the basket forcing Kad to take the shot and be a scorer and compared to a facilitator tble a pull up and the rebound from tremble I think they put a lid on that basket look out tremble and heres RJ d and Dort going to be called for the foul big lead Dort this will be his first and the fourth on the Bears here in the second half and this decep tra we saw throughout the entire nonconference getting rebounds pushing the basketball putting pressure on the opposing team defensively the nice find to RJ Davis and now are they is making sure this was a shooting foul that that was a dangerous play yeah Dort isnt a small guy RJ that could have been tough yeah well you cant make the foul more severe just cuz the guys big I mean hes tried to make a play just got caught off balance take the two fouls and be happy I say this just because of his presence he is 610 listed at 245 he looks much bigger than that and and RJ Davis is listed at 6 feet and hes much smaller than that so therefore that would have been a tough fall I mean fortunately Dort didnt fall down on RJ true we may be going to have to get RJ off the floor free throw good by Davis hes got seven in the Applause game theres Lee dor from Dallas who transferred in from Vanderbilt you see this you see all the smiles on the bench theyre going to replay that uh multiple times in film session so RJ can see it sto yakovich is pass taken away by Trimble hes got CAU in Washington Applause and Jackson look away for Jaylen Washington blocked by Dort save by Jaylen laon I give block kadoo layup good and I love how Kau is now going to the basket looking to be a scorer not looking to give the basketball away theyre going to force him to score go get a bucket Carolina by 22 Wilkinson bodying Kad thats an offensive foul first on Jeremiah Wilkinson its the fifth on Cal Carolinas defense is just taking Cal out of everything theyre doing yeah its a 22o game 6139 Timeout on the floor people talk about the rich people they the normal people are living there and theyre losing everything theyve had and the chance of getting the right insurance and all that and how that works oh yeah thoughts and prayers with everybody there as we played tonight here in Chapel Hill Carolina by 22 and Ian Jackson a three recovered on the Baseline by Withers heres Jaylen Washington and wi is going to give Carolina a third crack at this I love we talked with youday was earlier today and he was encouraging Jaylen Washington to shoot threes he wants him to shoot a couple in practice every night even if he misses him to make make sure he becomes more confident of taking those shots as Elliot Kad gets to the basket uncontested once again I believe kads figured out how C is trying to play him and hes taking advantage of it 15 nothing run for Carolina in the last 5 and A2 minutes you cant let a guy like that get driving space and hes getting driving space every time Ola Joseph from the foul line area straight layup but as we were talking about jayen Washington and hu Davis wanting him to get up a couple threes he said never have to ask Ian Jackson to shoot threes or many other players exactly whether they should or shouldnt Jim right thats right heres Trimble with the left hand sasoko the rebound Ola Joseph teas one up and the long rebound taken out of there by Trimble look at set trible now and a little Euro in the bucket he had Christian Tucker beat and its his third field goal double figure not sure how many games that you have to start or come off the bench to be considered for six man of the year however Seth Trimble would absolutely be in that conversation with if he can get his offensive scoring back the way that he was playing in a nonconference before having to miss three games but due to injury he could absolutely be Sixth Man of the Year in the league sooko back out front heres Tucker three and its good six three of the year for Christian Tucker and that was a better look than theyve been getting Jackson tremble Washington Kad and Withers for Carolina and Andre sto yakovich still over there with two points by the way as Kad missed the layup heres a pullup two by blacker and sto yakovich on the stick back gets his second field goal WD I shot that shot a lot to pull up three transition however I made a few of them too its a hard shot I think but but its a harder shot when you havent made any of them now would you agree with that thats true but its a hard I dont like that shot its not an easy shot look at Jackson challenging sasoko and gets the roll thats a hard shot however Ian Jackson makes it look so easy we talked about his explosive athleticism 13 for Ian Jackson Coach K really good Ill say you know what I love even more hes got a personality to match it its not just about his game hes the infectuous type of Personality look out now tremble to the basket thats go been a go call looked like that might have been in the cylinder it was back for sto yakovich Tucker right hand Runner spins in Christian Tucker with Applause five and the other way goes tremble and held onto the rim to keep from falling after the contact from sasoko surprised this was not called because you can always go over and review it once its CAU as it goes up SE tro gets it on the glass and then even with it not being touched touching it backboard is a goal team Music all right just ahead of 5 minutes to go look at the defensive numbers tonight Jim and Cory for Carolina and what theyve done to Cal and heres the other thing too the brand identity of North Carolina now in the last decades not necessarily been defense now it might be well Hubert made a little change the first year they were pretty good they did some things defensively but this teams much better cover the perimeter their weakness is going to be inside but theyre good on the perimeter theyve got good theyre guarding the ball and theyre making it tough for sto agovic is a really good player and he just cannot get any space out here mainly because hes bigger and hes going against smaller guards and he cant get by him I believe that Carolinas guards are committed to defending the problem is they dont often finish defensive plays because they dont have the rebounding and the rim protection that theyve had throughout the pass I think thats whats missing from their defense but you got to give their perimeter players a lot of credit for the way theyre getting out sliding their feet staying in front of a great offensive player like sto yakovich and many of the guys theyve seen throughout this year and its not that Kells Miss shots open theyre not getting a lot of many good shots toos go back to the man Drake pal got the assignment on sto oage but you see the Trap coming immediately once he turns his back the tragis down the lane and power will snaps the rebound away and thats a great defensive possession because youre able to finish it with the defensive board after forcing the guy that you want to take the shot to miss heres RJ Davis against Wilkinson now back to Ian Jackson hell work through traffic took the contact and the foul Captain Jack 8 and2 15 in the game the foul on Soko will be his fourth when you look at the turnaround the last six games coming in here hes averaging 23 points a game but coach his ability to get downhill weve already talked about his shooting but his athleticism and ability to get downhill and thats not a small bump hes taken there from Soko thats a strong Defender but still the concentration to be able to get it on the glass and get a bucket and its unusual to see a freshman do that thats usually like a seconde progression hes already in there but you know New York City guy youve recruited a lot of those guys you know Pearl I mean come on lets talk about you know about New York City guard all freshmen are not created alike this is true Wilkinson the pull up and Luben another rebound we saw skip for Jackson and transition look out Cory yeah we saw Ian and Drake and James Brown a couple guys getting out of the car earlier today and I made sure to ask who is driving make sure Captain Jack was not driving Im not riding with the New York City guy they dont get their license in high school stovic has six he initially says see I can drive like yeah okay if you say so you can drive to the basket thats about it under four to go heres kdo Carolina with a 22point advantage and turnover on the dribble Campbell and the Bears running the other way heres Tucker and Dort hit the rim thatll be a hell ball Carolina will get it on alternating possession Lee Dort gives it back to the heels who are on their way to their 12th win of the Year their fourth straight and fifth in the Music ACC coming up with Eric free Josh past tonight from Charlottesville here is heres Joey brackets not Jimmy brackets Cory Joey brackets hes got Duke a one Louisville a s Clemson 8 Pitt and Carolina a nine SMU next4 out you know what gets me whats that this year has been historically the worst year that the ACC has seen in a very long time right right but its five teams right now in the tournament I know where the last three years where weve been battling over here that the league wasnt bad and weve been sending multiple teams to the Elite 8 Final Four Etc oh wa hang on went for the punch Jackson will triy the three and through all of that it was a struggle to get five teams in a year go and a foul will be on did Kido really just TI of D he did oh hes got that in his game now now wait a minute does he realize hes 510 he he still got that in his game he was definitely Above the Rim okay Coach here it is just take a look here we go coach Im watching yeah he can make that yeah he he he he can make that coach all right hes got that Ill give him credit for that couple of free throws here for uh how many dunks you think hes got in his life hes got a bunch of dunks Ive watched him hes got a bunch of dunks real quick here let me remind folks the good folks that are watching the game Carolina leading by 22 that ACC PM with Mark Packer where people can call in and offer their thoughts on Joe lardys Bracketology weekdays at 4 Eastern right here on acc Network we cant even criticize Joe this I mean no no we we were not fighting that battle this season I I think we can get five in though I really do I think itll be squeaky but I think we can get five in but it goes back to my issue of if we get five in this year how it was the struggle I mean Pittsburgh and wake four should have been in the tournament last year 100 so if youre talking about five this year and what was and what has been a down year why were we getting five for the last 3 years when the league was much better well nobody said that they knew what they were doing come on 18 for Ian Jackson by the way heres another turnover tried to wrap it through traffic for James Brown nine final four teams 111 wins since 2015 for the ACC but I believe the last three years consecutive been five five and five correct and again were talking about another five teams this year in a league that hasnt been as good no doubt Wilkinson the takeaway heres Jackson with RJ Davis and he take Ro and score that gives him 20 thats right about average yeah thatll be the sixth time in the last seven games he said 20 or more final 152 now in Chapel Hill and the tar Hills comfortably in front and theres a reach and a foul by Jackson thatll be his first just a third of the half on Carolina Huber Davis wanting to get jayen Tyson give me K Tyson jayen Withers into the game it looks over to Ian Jackson lets him know to foul stopping the Applause clock WD let me ask you this is it still blue steel is blue steel so was blue steel A specific group of young men on the on the Carolina bench one team one year a little carry over gotcha Applause Yeah final 140 to go blacker the pull up and the rebound for Withers so Carolina getting ready to win for the fifth time in six meetings against Cal last time they played 1998 Gino carile had 29 the Golden Bears won in Oakland against the tar Hills the uh time they played last in an NCAA tournament Carolina won it was at Syracuse by the way Jim March of 97 and uh Carolina had Vincent Lamar Carter from Daytona Beach Florida heard of him in the lineup yep and Cal had this guy who was like a big forward named Tony Gonzalez he was pretty big I had a home visit with Tony wow he was a really good basketball player no kidding he didnt really want to go that far he loved me but he didnt want to go that far you going to let him play both play both Im about to fact check that one were you going to let him play both football okay which should we mention we had a FaceTime today with the great stuff yeah Stephon Mar the second is on the bench for the cow bears and talk to starberry earlier today we did that was an amazing and he looked at me and said I I dont believe it OMG OMG I dont believe it I said yeah youre surprised Im still here thats what youre surprised he was in eighth grade at our basketball camp and we had a really good camp he dominated the camp in eighth grade thats how good he was was when he was young well I tell you what he continued to do it throughout his entire career even at the highest level of the NBA Vladimir pavich and Matt desler have come on the floor along with Jack MOSI into the lineup here for uh Cal and theres an Up and Under move and thats PA Tyson first points for Tyson a little known fact we recruit all the my brothers and did not get one of them so I dont know what that says Devin Curtis is a 611 sophomore from Milwaukee wearing number 13 for Coach mson heres MOSI and a rim and by the way longtime ACC fans theres no relation with the former weight coach and longtime NBA executive Jack MOSI those guys have been gone for 40 years no similarity to the families is what Im at yeah nobody knew who you were talking about so Carolina wins 79 53 and the Tar Heels went for the
