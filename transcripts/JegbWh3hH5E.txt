UVA will get up and down the floor allowing talent on the other team to find the game as well So its interesting to watch how UVA at times can let teams play with them A lot of orange in the house today in the opening tip controlled by the team the white unis the home squad in Virginia Cavaliers go to work 18th in the country third place in the ACC Theres a cut and its off the knee and an early turnover Or no theyre going to say it stays with UVA I thought that was off the knee of Dalon Hall I was number one impressed with the fact that your colors are matching both teams today Thats big time Theres a method to the madness You get away with orange on a day like today Heres Malik Thomas An early touch and Thomas transfer from San Francisco Tester Ritter leading scoreer 23yearold freshman not this time Well so much of Virginias offense comes off the dribble drive just trying to break through and play drive and kick basketball Orange led by Donnie Freriedman leading scoreer over 18 points per game Leads the ACC in terms of PPG on the road averaging over 23 per contest Sam Lewis picks up an early foul Somewhere out there well be able to make sense of that why you play better on the road And you just wonder is it pressure expectation When youre on the road you tend to let loose a little bit more Were you like that as a player on the road Kind of cut it cut it free I dont remember but I think you do have a a different edge when youre on the route on the road Fans help with that Kings lethal threepoint shooter too strong Rebound pops out to Thomas And for UVA Thomas on the move missed the layup Transfer from San Francisco Sam Lewis coming in from Toledo Johan Grunlow 7 foot rim protector And inside is JJ Sterling Thats a good sign for Syracuse to get him going early Also just set your defense up and be disruptive Just dont give up wide open threes Lewis had 15 and Carolina early three to start today If you have a chance to set your defense and to give up a wide open three that thats a mistake Euro for Stling Rejected by Grumbo how important is it for Syracuse to get off to a decent start here Now I can answer I was waiting to see where it happened I want to jump the gun Look I think its important for confidence Confidence is everything particularly when youre struggling You bring a lot of past failures into every game when youre a young team And young team is not just young in age Its young in time together Youve got to learn how to win You got to learn how to persevere And what is perseverance with the oneyear team Hard to find it Kuno to the strike Was fouled on the putback 50 free throw shooter this year Hes been outstanding in terms of his rim protection Over two blocks per contest Whats the proper thing there Like you asked me a question but something was happening No you can play it either way you want to We can have the conversation I didnt mean to disrespect you and ignore you No no no no Nor did I think that you were doing that Were on the same page Cavaliers 42 advantage Just underway in Charlottesville Virginia in third place in the ACC Duke at top the league standings that critical matchup later tonight at the Dean Dome against Carolina Everybodys been talking about it Game day was there Great atmosphere a lot of signs And the timer down to eight A foul inside and some contact So Sam Lewis just picked up his second and thats going to prompt Ryan ODM to go straight to the bench Find a matchup that you can win The key is that everybody else on the floor on the offensive end recognizes it too That time Syracuse did a good job in terms of recognition who had the advantage and now you got two fouls and you got to sit probably the rest of the half Lewis goes out checks in the Cavaliers Shot clock already under 10 Hey George on the move Freeman finally a touch and was hacked and Ditter smacked down and the foul was called Can Can I say something probably get offended by but other people would go Yep youre right The facial expressions of Europeans Watch the facial expression Come on SEE IT A THEYRE SO ANIMATED AND THERES A But theres a lot of coaches out there Theyre also animated in a negative way too They get down right And a lot of coaches in the American game have to adjust to the I dont know just the the way these guys are just animated Theyre different The whole game over there is different that way Its a different style The way that they play the game is different Starling now for early points for Syracuse Just dont be a European soccer player every time you get B The flailing drives you bonos against the zone and attacking off glass No Freeman controls Donnie Freeman The bounce pass and a sweet delivery by Nate George with a reverse Really good start for Syracuse Even defensively not overhelping You dont want to chase and flock to the basketball on a dribble drive giving up open opportunities Step back three short rebound Telis outside to Hall Oh how about the ball rotation Wide open look off the right side of the rim controlled by Games Cold start for UVA just one for its first seven Stling already with four was bumped and Tillis picks up his first How about the rebound and run out led by Donnie Freeman and then making the right decision I mean thats a good pass Not really an easy pass and then a good smart finish The Ritter picked up that one foul with the animated face He he knows not to contest too hard on that layup Well Ditters been so much fun to watch this season his scoring and hes really stepped up his role coming overseas average about nine and a half points per game And we talked to Ryan Oman about that this morning He said we knew he was a role player and he knew coming over here that he was going to be much more impactful Thats exactly what hes been He basically played in the NBA overseas ACP is a ridiculously high league I was cheering going to ask you about that You have experience and off glass goes Nate George Hes got four Yeah Short experience cuz I got sent home But yes like it is a really high level of basketball where youre playing against professionals not just grown men We overuse that term but youre playing against professional grown men and youre learning how to play the game Youre learning how to space Youre learning all the the intricacies of the games within the games make you develop so much as a player So what a get to find an old freshman with tremendous pro basketball experience Shows on the court after Thomass three The alleyoop the left side of the rack That was Suare Thomas with a team high 41 triples after that last three and kicked into oblivion And you cant get mad about it because you got other teams recruiting from the NBA Its where we are A lot of people talking about that these days as we step aside the potential of your season and playing a certain way is what does that Now the demeanor of this man Ryan ODM is is what Im most focused on in a oneyear team skillbased pro style game You cant be an absolute nut job on the sideline and expect your team to be loose I think thats something that will have to shift over time with coaches how they act on the sideline how they behave and yell and scream at players if they want them to be loose and confident He does not struggle in that department Always cough No But I think a lot of people should pay attention to the to the reason why the players are loose and confident Thomas shot clock winding down and he traveled I mean you see some of the antics and youre like in what other in what other uh environment Can you act like that And is it helping your guys who you just met four weeks ago It probably wouldnt be a great idea for me to walk into a convenience store and throw my hands up in the air crazily If I had my way I would have AI make a video of some of the antics we see on the sideline and put them in the middle of normal everyday life and see how ridiculous it is Im making enemies Good start on the road for Syracuse Freeman with a shot on the midrange Virginia on the move the other way Tillis and was fouled going to the rack Dont forget a top 20 womens college basketball matchup comes your way Sunday afternoon with first place on the line in the SEC Lady Balls in Columbia to tangle with Don Staley South Carolina Gamecocks That is Sunday 300 Eastern on ABC Keep an eye on Joyce Edwards sophomore now figuring things out in a major way in the Southeastern Conference Now that was terrible transition defense where nobody communicated and stopped the basketball But on the other end they got Donnie Freeman the ball in the top of the key Syracuse has to do a better job of spacing getting out of his way letting a playmaker make plays He was too congested and he ended up having to settle for a tough shot Great conversation this morning with Red Autry who you just saw the Syracuse lifer Third season as the headman for the Orange Jim Behive is the ultimate lifer though I would agree but he played for coach and he coached with coach The bar of a lifer is set differently when Beahheims done it You think Jims watching right now Hope hes doing well Could be working right now Jim we hope youre doing well If youre enjoying the broadcast we appreciate you We apologize for for all the shots I took at coaches today Nut jobs on the sideline Shot clock down to four Donnie Freeman back to work healthy right foot and off the mark Missed nine games earlier this season of course surgery last year He has been quite the difference maker and Syracuse needs even more have a chance to win this game on the road like that getting set back up in the zone Its just disruptive so long as you can close passing lanes That was too easy Just kind of launched that one up quickly and Virginia by three cheering Hard screen and White was set back for a moment Freeman double team AND STOLEN BY CHANCE MALLERIE cheering Cavaliers in the midst of a seven nothing run Looking for more open look for Hall cheering Its what they do so well And this is in no way a knockoff on Tony Bennetts teams but they didnt push looking to score quickly Thats a lot different with this group They are pushing to seek out shot opportunities and it happens to be the best they get cheering through the double team and a foul was called with a trip Yeah good defense and you got a team in transition defensively in Syracuse who struggled to stop the ball last time No ones really slow in the basketball down Malleries able to pick out his pass One extra pass you get an even better shooter an even better shot And the Jakarmi likes it Jakari does enjoy it Got some of the Jakari in the building again today And Mallerie gets some words of wisdom There they are Thats great There was a taco sitting next to the Jakari earlier This I think they moved the taco It just didnt fit It was confusing Off the bounce William Kyle Elite shot blocker goes to work Goal number 42 back iron Tony Edso with the outstanding defense A sevenfooter can do really well by just walling up He forces such tough shots there Theres really no need to block every shot Just wall up Paul the no look alioopa went off the glass BYU transfer gets it back cheering and a turnover Virginia with a sixpoint lead Syracuse the other way And Starleys lob was rejected on the end zone He gets to everything against the zone Great bounce pass inside from all dropping the D Thats really good stuff And up until that possession I would say that UVA offensively has been selectively crisp where they have been great possessions and then there are some where theyre throwing the ball off the glass and missing the pass cheering That possession is something you build off of Virginia comes at you in waves this year under his first year head coach Ryan ODM now with an eightpoint advantage It didnt take long and a foul What I like most about our conversation with Ry Ryan ODM like early this morning by the way you were dressed up for this game at 730 in the morning I really was Bless you for it for the shoot around Yeah that was early He did notice the pocket square He did He liked that Um you feel pretty good about that right Of course its still there 5 hours later what he talked about was the type of guys that he got And he he got guys that were leveling up Something to prove Theres something to that I dont think theres any specific formula how to how to coach and build oneyear teams anymore But the reality is if you identify the right guys that allow you to play the way you want to play but also have the instincts and the personalities that fit where you are you could win with guys that arent coming from the power five demanding big seven figure contracts whatever that is George after being fouled by Hall gets the roll on the second free throw attempt Put air quotes around contracts Just glad somebody noticed my pocket square You certainly didnt Dinner short Not everybody needs accessories Rory laughter 16 10 Big possession for Syracuse George backto back possessions The quick hitter opportunities there for Syracuse They just havent been able to find it Always best to attack a defense that isnt set UVA has really started to find and again selective crispness on the offensive end but when the defense is good it leads to good offense music This is a UVA team that when theyre polished theyre as dangerous as anybody in the country Particularly to one your team skillbased game Heres Shakari White behind the back inside had an open look Kunlow contests it and connects Wasnt the most athletic finish but it worked Its not how you drive its how you arrive Thanks Dad Off the bounce and Freeman though D Ritter was there Excuse me Pass back to Sam Lewis whos back on the floor with the two fouls Virginia lead is six under 11 minutes to go in our first half I go right back to where theyre going to double The ball rotation is brilliant White Mallerie on the offensive glass Right place right time Now its Lewis They create a great rhythm with their ball movement but if youre going to go against the zone I would throw it wherever theyre going to double because the scramble out of that is going to put the defense in a bad spot Thats why they got an offensive rebound and another shot from three White nearly had the steal Freeman on the attack Freeman with a stick back And theyre going to tee up Donnie Freeman here Roger Ayes There was a little bit of chatter right after the layup on the offensive rebound And Roger Ayes quick trigger here with a technical foul I dont know what he said He was serious about it It was a good play but but just dont negate a good play by having to say something You know Donnie Freeman I thought played well in that loss against North Carolina 23 points held his own with Caleb Wilson the talented freshman who you think could be better than Camboozer at the next level And there you see Just throw that in there Well you told me that pregame and I just kind of did a double take I wasnt ready for it I I do I I just from from a pro standpoint Yeah I think he can play multiple positions I think defensively hed be different Hes going to develop a shot right now Hes got a good midrange game I mean look Im not trying to improve anybodys draft stock Im just saying what I see Donnie Freeman was that guy coming in last year I think the inconsistencies really hurt Donnie Freeman I think it certainly hurt Red Autry Yeah just just a plain inconsistency What can you build upon Well its tough to build upon something when you dont have consistent time on the floor That was the right foot last year Missed 19 games Different injury with the same foot this year Missed nine more Weve seen him in ACC play Going back to the league opener against Clemson Ditter looking for contact No whistle If youre going to draw that much attention in a zone somebodys open And Ditter without a point off the fingertips of Kyle out of bounds Well Donnie Freeman we had an interesting camera on him pregame and I dont know that Ive ever seen anything quite like this Yeah the Uncrustable is great for that pregame meal but to take the crust off music the Uncrustable is something I dont think Ive seen before JC Its called redundancy Like whats the whats the point of having Uncrustable I mean look to each his own But but that just seems weird Maybe its a calorie thing Its like its a jelly sandwich at that point You take off all the crust Theres nothing Theres nothing better Im going to tell you this Theres nothing better I hope this goes go Nope Theres nothing better than a half frozen uncrustable at the you know in between ninth and 10th hole of the golf course Just saying it right there Its There is something magical about it The charge was called on Nate Kings and Mallerie absorbs the contact Charlottesville native Grew up less than a mile from where we are right now JPJ Tell you what he was recruited by a lot of schools He was a member of our guy Paul Biancards top 100 He has paid massive dividends in his first campaign for the Wahoos and was hacked That was not an easy catch and delivery there That that was on this case a little bit about the last finish but that little slip roll the footwork to turn catch and still get a shot up That thats pretty darn good Its a good read too Defenders come high slip right to the basket occupy those backside defenders because if thats not there on the roll the skip to the threepoint line on the opposite sides wide open Cavaliers coming off a throttling of Pittsburgh on Tuesday night 6747 Theyre going to double check to see who that infraction was on that putllo at the strike I dont think it was on the ball It looked like clean at the at the shot on the body Maybe this ones always funny because you go look at it and you go Shoot he didnt get fouled Well that could be an issue because weve already shot one free throw Well you cant cant pull it away Just got to give it to somebody cheering Largest lead for the Cavaliers Sadique White was down there with the contact And UVA now seven of eight at the line White other end of the court Jump hook is there Thats nice You just got to give each other space and sometimes the space is up to whoever doesnt have the ball You got to read the play Dont run to the basketball Space out Whites able to make the play on his own Cory White from downtown 286 And here comes Virginia Good ball movement music Starting to find confidence I question the crispness Earlier I said selectively crisp Theyre starting to find it particularly against this zone Moving the basketball creating a little rhythm Good rhythm higher music percentage threes The Virginia bench two early fouls for the Cavaliers the 12point lead John Crispen Roy Philpot And you take a look at UVA and they have assisted on all made field goals Is that a big deal to you Because I hear that all the time Its against the zone Does that mean something more or less No I think against the zone its expected that a lot of the made field goals are going to come off of assists Otherwise itd be an absolutely godawful terrible zone if you could dribble right through it and get to the basket Now in a different style game where its manto man the drive and kick thats leading to good ball movement thats getting the defense to chase So yes the assisted made field goals mean a little something more means youre playing for one another Naturally against the zone the balls going to move and its going to find an open hand You got to make shots Syracuse in the bonus rest of the way And one more free throw coming as Donnie Freemans back on the court after picking up that technical foul I got a text from my wife at the break saying that my JJ had a little fit leaving the trampoline park So JJ if youre watching relax bro laughter Didnt have that on the bingo card this morning Hes four It happens Ditter yet to score and was fouled by Kyle lead shot blocker third in the country in that department Ditter to the free throw line You know we talked about the aggression of UVA and thats kind of what excites me about this group excites me about the future So if Im a UVA fan I I I see the hope in the way this teams playing and the type of talent that its going to attract but the aggressiveness in terms of attacking the press to score thats a good thing to see Tester Ritter also a standout tennis player Look at Ryan ODMs stance Look at the stance Hes just so chill and I just think it means so much I dont mean to dump on everybody else who doesnt act like that I did but I dont mean to Just saying theres something to the way they want to play and how you behave Its It communicates something to your team I thought you were talking about the Ritter Youre talking about Ryan OD Ryan ODM Yes He had his hands behind his back like very casual loose of course son of Dave ODM the former Virginia assistant for all those years cheering here at UVA under Terry Holland and Virginia wants a challenge and lets see Roger Ayes going to take a look at this should be Virginia basketball challenge by University of Virginia thats Virginia basketball should be a quick one Lord willing its a quick I like the idea of being able to challenge it Far beats the swizzle stick that just led to nonstop stoppages and rhythm killing games You need to show the swizzle stick Like we need that on camera so people understand what youre talking about No I I think people saw it so much that they know exactly what Im talking about But this is good The hope is that we could do these things quickly particularly when theyre this obvious and get right back to the play So so we dont suck the rhythm out of the game Its a free flowing game I apologize for the long review It is clearly off Syracuse numbers 42 Itll be UVA ball on the baseline 30 on the clock UVA retains the timeout and UVA has one final challenge But thats a long review Youre my best friend That was fantastic Yeah Thank you Roger Harris describing what happened and then almost being apologetic because it took longer than it should have I tell you what officials watch tape they review things You should review that and say Do it like that right You know what He could have taken as long as he wanted to If you come back with that kind of response that was brilliant Just dont do it so badly Thats like Im sorry for sucking the life out of this game Virginia lead is 11 Approaching 7 and 12 minutes to go First half at JPJ Critical match up in the ACC Syracuse can really jump start second half of conference play to win on the road Easier said than done and a traveling violation Mallerie the fourth turnover for the Cavaliers today I think the switching defense or switching of defenses has been somewhat disruptive because UVA has taken a few seconds to figure out how theyre going to attack And if youre able to get a team to set or reset their offense it allows your defense to get set as well Mallerie rarely turns it over Dynamic assist to turnover ratio especially for a first year guy Now thats a good step particularly first year guys where youre trying to just still feel out the game at this level level up to high major college basketball taking care of the basketball and sharing Its a big deal Stling off glass We had the first four points of the afternoon for Syracuse now with six The lead down to nine Malik Thomas with a pass and the finish Well Thomas all WCC cheering last year at San Francisco led the conference in scoring What a dynamic find in the portal to be able to get him here when you led a mid major league like the WCC the West Coast Conference in scoring It is UVA you know cheering kind of a nice place Pretty high level of basketball and the ACC has been terrific this year Vastly improved right Yes Freeman step back three Good Well I think theres something to that as well Roy I I think the reality is there are limitations and the limitations now fall fall in the form of budgets So it will naturally spread out talent throughout the country And while last year was all SEC I think the talent is everywhere I think theres more talent the mid major than we even know I think were discovering that right Oh yeah Via the portal Tillis the grown man basketball in the paint off the mark too strong On the move is Charlotte Well you see the Jets with the bounce Quick shot opportunities Theyre there for Syracuse I think to cap off that conversation though the conversation about recruiting Its not really recruiting as much anymore as its about roster construction Theres a ton of talent out there to recruit but can you construct a roster that can compete together Theyre still learning that Mallerie thought about it Also when you think about combining the personalities its all that of a new group right All of it Scrimmage play pickup on off glass Well cheering done You want to establish a team Look Im not a coach I havent coached cant say what to do but you need to find those playground dynamics right Whos who Let them figure that out on their own and they will be far better in in February and March cheering Virginia fans hope thats exactly whats happening before their eyes in conference play Line change coming in for head coach Ryan ODM Stling with eight points Back to the basket A shove no whistle and the bucket Best call in college basketball Roy the no call Hes got 10 via the no call Ball rotation is there again for the Cavaliers Hall and the skip pass carums out of bounds JJ Starling he was a guy that they trust They they trust his feel Hes developed that throughout his career And the last few possession he knows they need a bucket Easiest time to score is where the defense isnt set And then going to work Love the no call Even if there was a dislodge it looked like there was a lot of contact there Whatever man I like offense Thank god they cleaned up the whole block charge The game got so boring when there were 50 charges a game More plays at the rim now Better flow This game far from boring Syracuse on the comeback trail A chance to make it a onep possession game Tyler Betsy does exactly that Syracuse is finding confidence but I think a lot of that confidence is coming from getting some stops switching the defense and just starting to communicate better on the defensive end Orange now two of four from deep Virginia five of 10 Hot shooting start for both sides behind the threepoint arc Heres Thomas Lewis has to go back to Thomas Deter wide open Good box out and Freeman claims a rebound Really good defense by Syracuse and its not just that theyre getting deflections that theyre having active hands and theyre taking passing lanes away Nate George ON THE MOVE AND A CHANCE FOR THREE Here comes Syracuse 3 minutes and 20 seconds to go in the first half and the Orange in the midst of a seven nothing run A free throw away from tying this one up Cavaliers have led by as many as 11 And Nate George the junior from Toronto transfer from Georgia Tech gets it done for his headman Brett Aut who needs a win today on the road music We appreciate you more than you know And indeed Syracuse in the midst of a heater to the tune of 122 on this scoring barrage And you take a look at what JJ Stling has done Double figures first four points of the game and Nate George has kind of stepped up his play already above his season average All these recent baskets have come in transition or the initial surge A lot of that coming off of a stop So the key is get the stop or the Syracuse defense has settled in They have still been switching the defense Get the stop get out run take your first best opportunity to cut into this thing And thats what theyve done The first best opportunity is always my favorite Yeah dont be greedy Cavs actually led by as many as 12 in this first half to Ritter Bruno No And here come the Orange Syracuse led early 84 Trailing ever since Last time they had the advantage it was 87 about 13 minutes ago cheering applause Offense has become stagnant on this possession Starling didnt care cheering And an air ball from distance You thought it was deflected It was not cheering Ive shot air Ive shot air balls before and I would usually claim it was defect deflected too Or defective Yeah No Im defective You didnt shoot a lot of air balls at Penn State or then at UCLA did you Ive had I had a couple and they dont forget What about at Rup Arena You you went off there Was there an early air ball there Any air balls there I dont think so But if you want to keep living in the past Im good with it laughter Dinner Some contact with Freeman Finally a whistle And lets see No shot Its on the floor They called the foul Hes so chill I love it Tied at 33 Ditter at the strike We mentioned his time overseas of course from Belgium and six man of the year playing in a very difficult league across the pond Look it its pro basketball and theyre learning how to play a pro game at a very young age 14 years old youre with a club and youre learning how to play against grown men Youre learning the game in a different way Skills are developed young but also a feel for the game No leg dish to Ritter from Hall No Dinner gets it back Second time cheering applause spot area of the game He He needs to become a good threepoint shooter Just a knockdown space out where pick and pops are there Pick and short roll is there Pick and roll to the basket and the seal Its all there cheering Youve got to really be a lethal threelevel scorer cheering George look what he found from the elbow He was looking to pass that on the way up and then changed his mind It was the right move cuz everything parted sometimes showing that pass It does get the defense to commit and opens up opportunity Nate George with 13 points Quite a statement by him in our first half Tied at 35 Great tilt in the ACC on a busy day ESPN networks more than 26 games on the docket Open three Grun low too strong Boy the Ritter kept it alive for a moment Almost in backtoback possessions That was a traveling violation Say a double dribble and a turnover The sixth for Syracuse Times you say its the perfect miss And thats kind of what it was He misses the three ends up with a right back throwing it down And hes hes got some friends and family in the stands Taking in the action Tell me you love it Remember what I said about Corpus and all that animation That doesnt prove my point Open three Jakari White Cavaliers 3835 I tell you William they they really needed that shot to fall Just struggling to find it again on the offensive end And they continue to be aggressive but the aggressiveness isnt really going anywhere getting a couple shots to fall getting defense to space out again They get back into that drive and kick basketballs going to be what gets him going heading into the half Lobin to Freeman lost it off the shin fell down out of bounds had a turnover cheering Oh Virginia with a chance for the last shot of the half I think its a last shot opportunity but its also a good possession opportunity You just got a three to fall Offense over the last seven eight minutes has not been good Theyve scored a little bit but it hasnt been great offense this To me its more important to have a good possession heading into the half You sound like a coach right there Is that Coach Chrisman I wonder if Id be any good as a coach I think in in the game today maybe I have a chance to be a decent coach Im always getting within the game but and I just hope I wouldnt be crazy on the sideline after saying all that I said earlier You probably would be the craziest of all the crazies I dont know Syracuse shooting 58 these first 20 minutes I cant wait long against the zone They waited too long to move the basketball Der top of the key three No good box out Orange have to go music and our first half comes to a close Sarah just one possession Orange shot 58 in the first half Seventh time this year in a half theyve shot at that percentage or higher Der aggressive move to start and contest it at the rack Free it on Q and the block on the other end by Grunlow Here comes Virginia Cavaliers in third place in the ACC Won three in a row after the comeback win by Carolina here some two weeks ago Kind of a surprising second half for Ryan ODMs team that afternoon I think UVAs got to create space early in the possession When they have people on the block they dont have room to work Theyre really not a danger to anybody I think you have to start with space in the possession Thomas will show the three then back away Made Starling do a lot of work there Step back triple this time THERE IT IS screaming BE CAREFUL WITH THAT MAKE Not great offense but its a shot that went in Those can often be fools gold makes Theres clappable misses and theres fools gold makes Cavaliers seven of 16 from deep Lead is back to six Freemans trying to get going to start the second half Cant do it here Maybe he can Good defense by Lewis And Lewis on the attack in and out Freeman saves it Now Syracuse the hangaround team to begin our final 20 minutes Red Audrey we talked to him this morning There was a lot of conversations in social media and articles in the New York Post this past week Foul inside before the shot and hes taken all that in stride Hes not on social media Says You know what In our locker room waters are fine The storms arent there the way that theyre being portrayed amongst all the talking heads in Cyberville I would say thats typically how it is And what youre telling me is half of what you read is complete nonsense I agree with that Are we responsible for some of that nonsense at times define we us in the media that talk on the radio and broadcast like this the media yes but but those of us who actually be we spend time around these people theres much more clarity as to whats actually happening and the feel that you develop by being around them you understand its not exactly how its portrayed in the media who really doesnt spend time with these people a world of experts At some point this games going to start up again Hasnt yet to begin the second half to Ritter Little contact from behind and they George didnt like it Go back to Red Autry and take a look at what Syracuse hasnt been really for the better part of this decade Of course Jim Beheim retires a Hall of Famer national championship in 03 all the great runs in multiple leagues And Fred Autry one of his assistants one of the top assistant coaches of course played at Syracuse in the early 90s And there is the expectation this team can get back to where it used to be No real signs of that yet this season even though the product I think has improved I think theres theres expectation and then theres reality And the reality is in the world today the way were playing professional college basketball anybody in one year could have an electric season And in a way what it does is it sets again a fools gold expectation that thats what we should do One year teams youre not building programs youre building teams And I just think its really hard Red Autry could do it this year He could do it next year Who knows At any point they could just completely turn it on the way were playing things as pro college basketball Kings from downtown The first points of the second half for the Orange Nearly 3 minutes in Big bucket Yenso bottled up by Kyle Der gets the roll Touched every inch of the rim on the way down Doing a good job of sitting down and being patient I think he thought he had a line to the basket that was closed quickly by the backside defender Litter getting to the open spot where he can make a basket Tester Ritter now with seven Its one for his first seven from the floor to start this one George connects Hes had the hot hand And George with 15 Its interesting when when Syracuse when the game gets picked up and theres a little bit of flow Syracuse picks up So its almost like theyve got to find a way to create that not allow UVA to create it for them Now Donnie Freeman talked about that after the loss of the Dean Dome earlier in the week He said Go back to the Notre Dame game Were moving the basketball around It was flowing then against Carolina Youre down 30 And it wasnt to Ritter and the foul will be offensive I dont see aggressive action to start the second half for UVA Feeding the post standing around the movement is not creating a chase for the defense And when UVAs at their best offensively theyre playing off the bounce Theyre attacking hard closeouts Theyre playing drive and kick basketball with a duck in and the duck down Just havent found it to start this second half But its been a bit of a low for the last 20 minutes Ryan ODM sensing what youre sensing He brings in Mr Energy and Jakari White Virginia lead is five Its a threepoint advantage at halftime Jakari Whites like Kendall Weaver for Texas Does a little bit of everything Well said by you Great look inside for Stling That was good defense just better offense And JJ Stling can do that In his career at Notre Dame hes got 12 points Playing better basketball more consistent Thats good defense You just got to stop at a reset which allows your defense to get set White probing Timer down to three LEWIS HAS TO GO LIS ITS ON IT Another bailout three right before the buzzer cheering William Cow the third Yes Im going to go back and say it again To me thats fools gold He didnt run good offense He just got a shot to fall So youve got to be careful not to get fake confident thinking that youre doing something really well Mallerie rejected into the first row off the bounce Now thats what a block looks like from William Kyle Thats just an absolute Thats where row six seats players across the country would all be this talented this efficient and really not look like first year players Just imagine 20 years ago youd be talking about wow Cam Boozer and Cooper Flag are really good together Oh man that would be insane Thats the world we used to be in Its hard Its Its hard to imagine it Offensive foul on the endel first and Zugo Syracuse gets it back Yeah that hurts Thats an ear check Ear check MALLERIE WITH A STEAL OFF THE INBOUNDS WHITE FOR THREE WELL that would have been huge Mallerie is there The offensive rebound Wide open look Sam cheering Lewis from downtown The best ball movement all day has come off of an of a UVA offensive rebound Its something they did not do well last year They are much improved cheering So Lewis with 15 at North Carolina 14 today despite the two early fouls I think a lot of good threepoint shooting teams are also good offensive rebounding teams Kings controlled by George George inside the reverse Spins it in If youre a good threepoint shooting team that means you create space Space means defensive rebounders are out of position When a shot goes up the offense has just as good of an opportunity to get it as the defense does Then those second chance opportunities are high percentage threes So I think it all plays together lead down to five Lewis couldnt get the bounce Freeman skies for the rebound Syracuse trailing by five Weve yet to see Cayenne Anthony in this game Talented freshman son of Carmelo of course Syracuse royalty the national championship in 03 Freeman able to get a swipe at that shot Anthony had 10 points in Chapel Hill Weve yet to see him on the floor this afternoon Contact no whistle The dump off Ripped away Virginia maintains possession Jakari White stopping Its good stuff Just get inside the paint See what the defense does If no one steps up stops the ball cheering Midrange game is not dead And the dump into the back court White against Charlie the euro cheering himself slams it and home the lead back to nine Thats a big swing and a lot of its just coming from energy and activity Much of that is White music He just brings a motor that the game at this point second half I said at some point second halfs going to start Whites been the catalyst of that energy and then Odso there to finish it off UVA backup n as great as he was and what he accomplished And by the way God bless Carmelo Anthony for what he donated back to that program considering the success he had coming from that program I I think its awesome But it is it is also a challenge for his son And I will tell you this Roy the story is not yet written right We dont know how it ends He is a tremendous talent Whats going on right now Who really knows Were not there dayto music day And there is Carmelo Anthony one of the greatest to play in the game Hes one of the greatest NBA music players Ive ever seen too And I dont think people understand how how great he was as a player Good for what he did for that program Story is not yet written for Cayenne Anthony Stling the floater in traffic when he bothered that one I talked to Paul Biancardi about Cayenne Anthony and his skill set He said hes a bucket hunter Paul Biancardi director of college basketball recruiting for ESPN But he said you know the expectations are always going to be so high when youre the son of Carmelo And so thats something that hes having to deal with and face head on his freshman year But I think your point that you made about his best basketball is yet to come Well its a long time in front of him to figure out how this thing is going to turn out I just think its hard when when guys like AJ Deans says doing what hes doing And looks like first pick of the draft Darren Peterson doing what hes doing Cam Boozer all these guys They were all in the same category as Kite Anthony So it is tough I dont I feel for the kid but at the same time again all the talent in the world all the opportunity in the world Story aint written yet Virginia outscoring Syracuse 171 to start the second half And that pass from on the ESPN app Is Mory Bailey going to play BYU I dont think so So weird Midseason acquisitions in college basketball AJ Debasa is going to play We like him My god hes unbelievable You know what I would do it with him I would just let him take over the game when the game starts Such a second half team because they let him take over and he just dictates the game You know I watched the Utah game two weeks ago and he took over the game from the jump He ended up with like 43 Just do that again Just do that I dont know Will Kelvin Samsons team allow that to occur Depends how its officiated Great point by you Kings out of the timeout Too strong Danger zone for Syracuse UVA You know Red Autry told us this morning its a team with the shooters that Ryan ODM has assembled could score four or five threes in a minute All of a sudden the games over Its shooters but also the willingness to shoot I think thats the thing Some teams say Yeah we got great shooters But do you let him go White the spin Well short Offense has been questionable when they put bigs on the blocks Just no room to work so they dont get the shots from drive and kick basketball Great cut by Kings trying to use the rim as protection and does the lefthanded delivery I think its also danger zone for Virginia if they play against a set defense every single time They just havent really been able to find consistent offense outside of two late clock prayer threes You take those off the board and this is a ball game Im waiting for a fools gold graphic because youve talked about it and it could end up being significant at some point Sometimes you can win with fools gold Shot clock down to four now at three in the end zone And you got to be able to win that battle if youre going to put a dig on the block If youre going to occupy the block you have to get the ball inside to the point where the defense now shifts low Now the attention for the defense has to flow in and say do we dig down Are we conscious of where the basketball is Then it opens things around the perimeter But if you cant capitalize on the block get them off of it Fools gold is still gold right No I think thats the idea What kind of pawn shop youre running Kyle Brief double team trying to stop it on the reverse Couldnt do it Cavaliers can go up by double figures again Don Hall on the endo for three Really not his game 29 from outside the arc cheering White leaf frogs for the rebound right over the top of George applause and cheering Well his energy you can feel it from our broadcast position Its infectious Bad is contagious Good is infectious That should also be on a graphic Ritter a quiet start for him White for three In and out TO RITTER ON THE OFFENSIVE GLASS They will count the bucket Or was it a foul applause And look if youre struggling from three a big piece of that is because you got bigs occupying the block Cant play drive and kick basketball Theres nowhere to drive But if youre going to get a oneonone situation youve got to be able to capitalize on it to the point where it forces defense low Once you do that it starts to open up threepoint opportunities because the defense is music starting to sag as theyre concerned with the presence down in the paint And as you said this is a UVA team that can knock down threes in bunches They did count the basket on goending Theyre now going to go and take a look at what transpired in the meantime Goending being challenged by Syracuse I dont think it was by the way We shall see How about that extreme closeup in the arena They put that extreme closeup of the official music you know telling us whats going on on the big screen And it is a 15 ft Roger Watch the ball here music Did he hit it music in the cylinder You cant make any contact I dont know that the trajectory ever shifted I dont think he hit it Is that clear and obvious Probably not Sometimes the more you watch it the less clear and obvious it becomes So it is a challenge by Red Autry here in Syracuse Of course you can challenge one of three components This being one If you have a timeout you still have the challenge Once you execute the challenge and it is denied you are done with challenges Fact of the matter thats not the you shouldnt swipe at the basketball when its already above the rim You dont give the official a chance to call goalending music but I still dont think he hit the ball Syracuse is right there You go back to what they did in the first half making a nice little run some quick scoring opportunities Theyre not far off I mean the ball never moves I just dont know how you overturn it and say thats clear and obvious Closer angle here I dont think he touches it music Kind of apology are we going to get for this one Well theres no doubt he will explain the end result and the final conclusion Theyre going to huddle up and go geez who knows Roger Ayes AJ Desai Adam Flor extended conversation Im sure conversing about the same things that we just did I I just even if theyre wrong even if there was a fingertip I just sit there and go No no music goending After review the challenge is unsuccessful Syracuse will be charged with a timeout and lose their final challenge The basket cheering is good Two points I dont know I just And I know what it is is its it wasnt clear and obvious to overturn it but I still dont think it was Kyle called for goalending Count the basket by Ditter Virginia lead back to 11 was as high as 12 points in our first half Syracuse offense is bogged down cheering Zeper back on the floor Kings a baseline K Silky smooth Hes been good Hes been aggressive off the bounce and hes when he gets it on a clear side hes quick about putting it on the deck Sometimes the quickest decision doesnt allow that backside defense to rotate over Orange will battle Cal coming up in the midweek in ACC play back at the dome Just got to try to steal a win or two against a team like Virginia Much easier said than done to try to get back in the conversation of postseason play Swatted out of bounds by Suare and the transfer from Georgia Tech 43 seconds on the shot clock The lead at nine under eight minutes remaining music Hey heat Kevin we cannot wait A little Hilton Magic in store in the Big 12 Back in Charlottesville John Crispen Roy Philpot Malik Thomas an airball and a shot clock violation by the Wahoos Their ninth turnover of the game Feel like UVAs been able to score when they really need one but throughout the course of the game they havent done it with consistency The attack has been you know poor spacing at times lacking rhythm so the threepoint opportunities arent there Havent really been able to find it with consistency and I got to give Syracuse credit for that Heres Kings Kings again A strong delivery right at the rim and contested Hes got 11 You just got to wonder like does anybody else scout and say dont let him go to his left Its really good when he does Weve seen that a couple of times today Three by Lewis Grunlow corrals a rebound Now its the freshman Mallerie Mallerie finds away with the reverse Get away He set up the reverse because hes dribbled through a number of times So everybody stays home and theres no shot blocker because they think hes going to dribble through and pass Its tough finish Jump stop by George and a George the response Lead back to seven Does Syracuse have one more run in it Make it a one possession affair Virginia workmanlike effort so far Mallerie step back three and the shot was so off it bounced all the way back right into the mix outside the threepoint arc Ditter to Lewis Shot clock down to three Malik Thomas nearly got it to go the high arcer Its just good defense stay at home for Syracuse Got to do a better job rebounding every shot Second chance opportunities really hurt Q with 19 offensive boards They lead the ACC in that category Here comes the Orange Suare with a dunk off the alleyoop Weve gotten so cheering many of their baskets off of their initial attack All right So be aggressive when you get a rebound and push it up and seek out a an advantage opportunity Lead down to five Derritter on Betsy outside to Lewis and the rebound grabbed by Donnie Freeman Orange have made their last four field goals Back in it on the road That was a good possession for UVA Just didnt get a good shot to fall And George applause and cheering an offensive foul Game starting to find it It was a slow start to the first half Mallerie a good job Hes tough when he gets baseline Hes typically dribbling two pass No one comes over to help Think hes going to dribble through and then just kind of back and forth The question is who can put it together in bunches Can Syracuse get a stop and a couple made baskets and then another stop and a couple made baskets Doesnt have to be a run just a couple good possessions in a row that build confidence into what youre doing and allow you to crawl back into this game to the point where you really feel like you have a chance Now Nate George just picked up his fourth personal The Red Autry can ill afford to have him on the bench He hasnt missed a shot today from the floor or from the free throw line with a game high 19 points Yeah now with five minutes left and the lead at five heres a turnover Kings on the move Starling the pump eight Starling was bumped on the way up and free throws coming Dont forget more mens basketball comes your way Wednesday night over on the ACC network 23 Clemson hosting Virginia Tech Little John Coliseum the place to be at 700 Eastern Wake Forest music and Georgia Tech at 9 Eastern over on ACC Network also on the ESPN music app But nobody is putting Brad Rell on a corner this year with that team Tigers playing some good basketball Hes a good coach too I think people really saw that last year cheering Chance to make it a onepossession game for Starling Free throw shooting Its been an issue this year for him and cheering the entire team Also need to steal Ian Shefflin back from the football team God I loved him I mean if you can get Amari Bailey into college basketball could he come back Good lord I I mean seriously just make it a lawsuit and you win Syracuse of 360 teams playing D1 basketball second to last at 358 as a team shooting free throws this season Lead down to four under five to go Virginia at 82 in the ACC in third place in the conference right there with Clemson right behind Duke Sam Lewis for 15 thats it thats the type of offense that weve seen this year from UVA drive kick attack another close out midrange game is fine wide next time down four theyre going to be concerned with the midrange then start to kick out again play against those closeouts 15 points against Pittsburgh third 16 points here against Syracuse Freeman lost the handle applause Its five points today Donnie Freeman Virginia trying to extend its lead In control for the majority of this game and in the second half after it was a threepoint lead at halftime Tillis to Hall wide open and Kyle able to climb the ladder for the board Syracuse within striking distance Heres Starling Jump stop A spin and short with a jump hook Hell save the possession Freeman for three Tracked down by Kyle Rare offensive rebound for the Orange He got Freeman down low He got pushed out a little bit too far So really no advantage down there Starling short saved by Kings and a fresh 20 again Virginia continues to scrap on defense Georges first miss applause That hurts a little differently if youre Syracuse You got multiple opportunities and nothing Although some of those misses were just bad enough for the offense to have the advantage Thats what it felt like Paul makes him pay on the other end and a chance for three cheering BYU transfer applause Thats what they did at BYU too Attack closeouts Ball swings close out rip through attack music If you have the space and no ones occupying the block thats there Problem is that hasnt been there all day An ideal time to start to find it music KC Cyclones ranked seventh in the country with just two losses And you take a look back here in Charlottesville what has gone down in this second half And Syracuse within striking distance has been held scoreless the last two plus minutes music And Virginia has made the orange pay when given the opportunity off those turnovers Thats the problem is the UVA offense hasnt been great The offensive side of the ball has been a little stagnant at times They struggle to create the space they need to be able to do what they want to do on the offensive end Those turnovers point back to what we talked to Red Autry about that that small margin right They have to be able to increase their margin but but to do so you cant make careless mistakes that hand the ball back to your opponent He told us today Our team is together in the locker room Its fine We have not seen Cayenne Anthony in this one so far And the freshman ranked inside the top 100 prospects left has stayed on the bench Thats Kings again with 21 Like when I prep for a game I basically do a scout And what my scout told me is he wants to get left Kings with 13 George with 19 His next bucket puts him over 20 points And Mallers next bucket is a three His first of the game Thats like traditional inside cheering out basketball You throw the ball inside to a to a top post player that brings two defenders and a little little movement around the perimeter frees you up Cavs have made 10 plus threes now for the 14th time this season cheering That is the most in Virginia basketball history Really simple good stuff You got a mismatch So its going to just theres a little dig down You lose sight of the basketball You dont see man basketball We cheering get beat even in the modern day the simplest fundamentals see man basketball keep your man between you and B whatever all that stuff that that all matters if anything more than that stling wanted to pull the shot couldnt do it runner is too strong now Virginia starting to sense at a ninepoint lead under two minutes to go a workmanlike effort today and I asked you during the break if Virginia wins Is that the only thing that matters Even if its not pretty even if its not aesthetically pleasing its been a solid effort today On the alley cheering I would say you can deal with the fact that youve had to just work and grind to win this game But ultimately I would define you by whether you can close it out or not Mallerie wants to do just that racing for the rebound Like not every games going to be pretty youre not going to play your best and sometimes the opponent plays a big hand has a big hand in that but good teams know how to close Virginia on the verge of winning its fourth straight game Chance to go to nine and two in the ACC Ono is trying to dunk everything today that ball was able to throw in the cheering and applause 112 run to create this separation on the end So another rebound cheering and Virginia faithful to their feet cheering applause UVA will improve to 20 and three 9 and two in the ACC Road trip to Tallahassee on the docket coming up next early next week Malleries got something interesting and he was throwing a lob That was the right play Hes got a nice little wiggle to his game and hes always looking to pass I think UVA is going to find it Like theyve got it They just couldnt really find it offensively today but they did enough to pull out a win Corner three by Lewis No to Ritter with the rebound Shot clock is off and the Cavaliers get it done at home 72 to 59 our final score in Charlottesville
