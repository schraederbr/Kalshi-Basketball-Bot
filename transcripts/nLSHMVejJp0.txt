to get off to a start right now you got three guys out there that have not played you want to get off to a start here if you can Kevin ji and Armando Bott get us going AJ decide Jamie lucky Paul zels on the whistle tonight here in Chapel Hill heres the likely ACC rookie of the year to start the possession with Marcus Burton and playing against the likely ACC Player of the Year RJ Davis a great match up to see these two guys going out Tate Davis strong to the basket Dey FIS defended they isolated too on the on the first time player and missed the L heres RJ Davis you see the lineup for the tar Hills Flo DAV Is WD now you know color blind but I was told that the pink shoes that RJ Davis is wearing are the same shoes that hes had on this floor when he scored 36 for a career high against weight force and then of course 42 the last time so we may see some magic off to a great start here ke a the noted aim lineup this is the way its been the last seven games The Freshman booth in there thats Tay Davis who was incredible in the second half Saturday at South Bend in the victory against Clemson Braden Shrewsberry jumps out bounds away remember RJ Davis the principal ball handler here and now you see Kau Ingram and Ryan work their way to the table for Hubert Davis as B sails one over the head of kraton Lebo thatll get a Carolina a turnover and the three Tar Heels will sub out and you cannot say enough about 47y old Michael Shrewsberry year one at South B coach hes brought this team back from way down to win five to six and they could have easily won in Syracuse too so unbelievable job with freshman and sophomores in the lineup thats hard to do in my opinion michah Shrewsberry is the runner up for ACC Coach of the Year by the way Hubert Davis in my opinion is in third place for that run but well get to those Awards a little later in our show but both these guys have had great years on the sideline Burton spinning through traffic and scores thats what Marcus Burton does as well as anybody in the league hes 5 foot at six and he doesnt play like it he gets in the lane and scores in the lane I want the Burton Family to know that that was Jim beheim who called their son 56 all right I might have been off he by the way listed at 511 has been on a tear heres his last three coach 27 points at 31 against wake doubl down had a terrific game against Clemson hes had 22 straight double figure games last nine hes had at least 16 hes playing great basketball theres no question about it I believe thats how he solidified the ACC Rookie of the Year what hes done over the past six games Burton to the ground Kau took it away turnover by the Irish after two in a row by Carolina Tar Heels in transition for bacock couldnt finish it but made the catch back for Kad the easy layup bounced out Elliot taks home his own ping his own stats going Moses Malone style getting offensive rebound and the P back for the bucket and hes about 59 also but he got up on that one he got at least up a couple inches carry Booth to Kev Jo Irish talked about being patient with a purpose here today ruberry young freshmans really kind of come into his own here in the last half dozen games as well Burton a step through five to shoot heres Davis on the drive Ingram kept it from him Davis resets flipped it up wouldnt go and now whistle in a foul and Paul zels from underneath has Bott for his first and our first foul of the ball game well the one thing you want to know is that Notre Dames hanging its its obviously they are not off to the start quite they wanted but theyre in the game early thats important Cory michah Shrewsberry talks about lets see if teams will get muddy with us right so when we say patient with a purpose you dont want to create 94 ft here in this building against this team tonight youre playing well no you absolutely do not if youre Notre a because youre playing into the hands of what North Carolina strength is but when he talks about teams playing in the mud with them they want to slow Carolina down the biggest thing for Michael Shrewsberry in this game is making sure that they keep Carolina out of transition where theyre so dangerous all right heres a look Carolina you see top of the chart on offense Notre Dame Micah Shrewsberry lets get money lets see if we can slow it down bog it down keep it under 70 coach how hard is that to do its hard to do that here you going to try to do that butar is not going to let you do that WD Michael shb talked to us in shoot around about making sure they got off to a good start he said they didnt have to get out 80 but they need to make sure it was 66 in comparison to being Carolina up big Ryan from the Music front Ryan and you cant leave him open there there was nobody there hes going to make those shots he was just two of his last 12 from three in the last two games coming in and theres a foul off the ball on ji thatll be his first sophomore transfer and the first unre name here and how about the motivation that cor M Ryan has here this evening playing against his former team former school so if t m Bry has a turnover throwing it to the Irish today you have to forgive him for that theres Davis out of the corner trying to add another one cannot nice box out by Booth touched by Ingram itll belong to Notre Dame Irish are here theyre two and eight on the road theyre two six on the road in the ACC theyve lost five of their last six in terms of road games but still 12 wins seven in League Play is far more than most projected when when we began the campaign and thats why I feel like Michel shw has done such a tremendous job but more importantly they lost seven straight games before winning five out of that last six to be able to keep your teams morale up coach that has to be extremely difficult for such young guys the young guys thats really hard to do and hes done a coach crry has done an unbelievable job keeping them in there and winning against good people and playing good basketball and theyve improved their offense thats what theyve done however here Carolinas defense has been so much better this year yeah tar Hills have kind of rebounded maybe after a lull a couple weeks ago Cory at that end of the floor I believe so WD they got refocus and they had the by week hu Davis had a full week to really get back to basics with the way they wanted to play and it showed up in the Virginia game and its been consistent ever since tar Hills Play Over the Top Kau tried to force a turnover enough to knock it into the Tar Hill bench were underway in Chapel Hill number seven North Carolina with seven on the board early he breaks Kei Clarks ACC record for games played tonight and WD you notice Armond Bott has a white jersey because he got the Carolina blue jersey last year on senior night before deciding to come back for a fifth year and you see the 162 games play which is the ACC record but you cant do that without winning remember two seasons ago played in the National Championship Game Y and you got to play a lot of games to break that record you know theres coaches worried that hes coming back yes I do I do know their coaches worried there is J good look by Shrewsberry for Kevin jas first basket Jim thats great out of the Huddle great play weak side cleared it out d m the Shrewsberry maybe some of his NBA pedigree paying off there Cory and could be of course spend a lot of time with Brad Stevens a Boston Celtics as an assistant coach and he uses a lot of his philosophies that he learned from that here in the college game ingr will t one up from the right bounds away B the rebound back up strong stripped out of there by Burton hes third in the league in Steels number one in conference Play heres booth for three and thats Tapped Out by Bott Davis the other way kadoo heres Bott Carolina trying to find the weak side this is Ingram just bullying on Booth who did a nice job staying with it and the pitch ahead and Julian rooper on the floor turned it over in transition and thats really been the difference for not as of late they handled the basketball so much better that time turning it over when they had an opportunity to get a quick bucket K slashing Ryan had a path into traffic against rer and will draw the foul moment ago we saw Ingram try to bul his way in there but a great job by boo standing his ground youre talking about a younger guy who isnt as physical isnt as strong but that time boo standing his round and using his limp to deny Harrison Ingram at The Rim Terry Booth of course is the son of Calvin boo a twotime big 10 defensive player of the year and former NBA player and and the thing with notame these guys have all got comp on both ends of the Court this year yep Ingram tried to bully it in there and wasnt happening you know wasnt head thats not really his game hes a spot up guy I think Notre D doing a good job just keep t stay trying to stay in the game one out of two at the free throw line for cormack Ryan already with a three in the bucket Carolina threepoint lead jayen Washington has come in give BAU some bench minutes here a couple minutes ahead of the under 12 timeout heres Burtons first three of the night long and Davis clears in Carolina three on three Washington trailing Applause Davis so dangerous in transition especially when he puts you on your heels RJ Dave is underrated in his ability to get to the basket but we know hes a lethal knockdown shooter on the drive is Burton deflected away recovered against tremble Shrewsberry wrapping around Runner with the right hand rattles in the the play that RJ made is a hard play to come full speed stop and shoot that medium range jump shot hes really gotten better over his time Davis trying to stay out of jas pickup theres Washington for three Jaylen Washingtons seven point of the year but thats the dimension that he can absolutely add to this BR G of team has the ability distract it from Beyond the threepoint Arc and came in with the reputation of a shooter out of high school Gary Indiana by the way the home of Michael Jackson in in case you didnt know heres ji Washington at the post with him Little up under and Booth Taps it home coach you talk about how those freshman have grown up Booth you see his maturity and the player that he is today in comparison to who he was on November the 10th when Notre Dame started playing so much difference give Notre Dame got tremendous credit second three with WD and when North Carolina gets stuff off their bench from these guys that raises them to another reble quick sixpoint Advantage Carolinas hit their last three from the floor Burton against tremble and what do we got here foul going to be on tremble lets go back to the offensive end Cory please here Seth tremble getting into his bag the quick between the legs cross we go to call it a tween WD between the legs TW TW Seth Trimble getting in his bag is able to finish at the rim and as coach mentioned when Hu Davis is getting offensive production from his bench this team goes to a different level because seum was going to do the job defensively different level so cadoo and tremble now on the floor with Jaylen Withers Jaylen Washington and cormack Ryan and heres Matt Zona who shoots threes a lot missing from out Applause front Washington trails now Withers boy hes been a spark Off the Bench last couple of thingses hadnt he he absolutely has and this is a young man thats truly accepted his role yep transferring in from Louisville Burton nice cross into traffic spot up jumper good second field goal for Marcus Burton Jim thats what he does better than I think people give him credit he gets into that spot and he makes that shot really consistently we talk about guys that play Fearless he does that heres Washington he got blocked Tay Davis in the mix down that front Court heres rer fourpoint lead for Carolina noted aame off the good defensive effort with the ball Burton and were going to get a whistle in a foul here and I think this is going to be on Withers and thatll take us to break off Seth trimbles action a move so nice we had to see it twice Seth Trimble with the TW cross for the easy lay here at UNC we want it all North Carolina and Duke tar Hills were ninepoint winners on February the 3rd gentlemen and well renew that one Duke won last night in Raleigh keep hope alive Carolina a win tonight would have a chance to win the regular season outright Cory thats been a talking point for Hubert Davis he believes that regular season Championship is of value to how you perspective your team if you will I believe it absolutely is is and Huber DAV of course got that from his mentor Dean Smith but coach how in your opinion how important is it to be the regular season ACC Champion its important I mean it is theres no question its a great league to win the league is is a special thing and you know its an accomplishment the these things have all been devalued over the years because theres so much emphasis on the NCAA tournament so it it is hes right its its important to win and its the first opportunity for Hubert Davis really to be at the top of the conference he hasnt been there yet in his three seasons theres Bott strong against Zoda and Aro on the board RJ was smart he wanted to get arm on the board he was looking for him all the way thats what the smart point guards do coach great job by RJ Davis getting Arondo involved and getting him a good look burton all the way through hell leave it for Davis in the corner knocks down a high arcing three just the sixth three of the year here for Tay Davis but thats been the difference for noted a Tay Daviss play over the last six games has been a Difference Maker we talked about Burton but theyve gotten great production from Davis as well Bott slips it for tremble on the drive and Armondo now will tend to shoot against Matt Zona hell roll back strong off the window hell draw the foul on the senior Matt Zona third on the Irish first on Zona quick reminder to you this is just game one tonight game two in Winston Salem boy Joel coliseums become a house of horrors hasnt it Wake Forest is undefeated Damon STM and Georgia teeker there after a weekend Victory against Florida State anise shra Tom creen standing by to bring you our coverage at 900 tonight on acc network but remember Damon stms press conference after being blown out at home by W four I do Im sure thats something that he has talked to his team about a lot and also as you mentioned W force is a tough place to play this season Steve forbs had those guys playing great at home theyre night and day home and away it shouldnt be that big of a gap but it seems to be this year with wake and Virginia Tech and Virginia it is a big gap are you concerned after losses at noted aim in Virginia Tech for Forbes as deacons when it comes selection Sunday J itd be good for him to win the two home games which I think he will Ingram thought about it from the corner off an offensive chance here for Carolina Tar lead four look at Ingram to the right side cant finish knocked out packs in roic on the floor draws the foul I think thats Marcus Burtons first and it is fourth on the Irish in the half and one of the things weve seen because of the you know number of the senior starting that wouldnt normally be in a starting lineup weve seen a number of different rotations already for North Carolina Coach you think this has anything to do with them maybe being a little bit off as of right now no I dont think so I think hes getting some guys in there and I think its a good thing Notre game has not got a lot of players theyre going to wear on him a little bit Davis had it rattle out rebounded Logan IM The Freshman zionville Indiana who scoreless in his last three ball games now out there and Ingram well he deflects a ton of basketball he absolutely does has great hands great anticipation but more importantly defensively hes sound and going for Steals and Def fls with the right hand that when he doesnt get them hes not out of position five to shoot heres Burton taking Ingram on all the way down to P scores thats just a big time play this guy just gets better every time I see him from the beginning to now he just gets better and better fifth best score in conference Play at just under 18 a game as Marcus Burton and Davis will draw the foul from J thats two on the Irish sophomore but how about another look at the Fearless efforts of Marcus Burton Jim I mean hes going against a really good defensive player here and hes got Bott waiting for him under the basket and its just doesnt phase him hes going to go to the hoop Judah minz does that a little bit for Syracuse they just theyre going to the hoop Jaylen Lowa Pits the same kind of guy isnt he Cory he absolutely is but did you notice how somebody got a Syracuse mentioned in there I was just wondering if anybody else was going to pick up on that well I have to say put have me a little underrated at this point of the season I can tell you that b missed the dunp Ingram slapped it out loic gave effort and now heres Barton standing fre and its dropped out on the right side now you know every if anyone is a fan of the pull up three on the break its me but that was not the opportunity for it I thought on a two on one he could have taken it to the rim got an easy layup and they get a tie game I mean yeah you got to you got to make that play how about this three they come back with a three now youre five down instead of two those are the things that turn around ball games when youre playing Carolina you cant do that RJ Davis very quiet seven here so far to lead Carolina this is what I love most about RJ Davis this season especially taking the challenge of guarding Marcus Burton the best player for noted a hes accepting that challenge doing it on both ends of the floor look at Davis into traffic hard on the dribble we get a foul before the shot wow no why not and its going to be on I believe Kad Elliot Kad West Orange New Jersey his first fourth on Carolina you dont agree with the whistle here huh this is my first this stun we got a little surprise here I mean hes all in the motion right there I mean almost 12 minutes 12 minutes this is a very good referee in crew right here these guys are all good thats thats how you qualify it yeah and you just crush them everybody misses the call everybody misses the call once in a while it has been here RJ the pick and the layup nine for Davis and that is some kind of oneonone matchup there it is a great match up to see these two guys going at a presumptive ACC rookie of the year against a presed ACC player of the year and its been worth the the watch already go to timeout RJ Davis has unlocked the game Jim and this is just a such a turnaround they miss a three now our Jim comes back and hits a three so now he comes back down and steals that makes a great steal from carmichel Arena right here in Chapel Hill coverage of the finals begins at 7 Eastern on Sunday right here on acc Network and the ESPN app Sean Kenny and athley roess handle our coverage of a winter sports championship right here on your home of ACC championships ACC Network womens basketball allies womens basketball championship starts the March Coliseum in Greensboro full coverage up until Sundays championship game right here on acc Network as well going to be exciting action in Greensboro when you consider the ACC has to be at the top of the charts of conferences in womens basketball yep it seems as though every team throughout the year had a number beside their name as far as a national ranking here is Burton out of the timeout Tay Davis with five to shoot back for Burton hell launch and front rim miss an Ingram grab I think Burton was a little surprised to be that open on that one Co a little de miscommunication they missed a little bit he still was off balance it wasnt a good look Carolina played good defense Ingram tes one up and hits largest leader theight for the heels on Harrison ingrams first basket when he makes those shots and Ryan gets going theyre really thats when Carolinas really good Ill go back to you guys mentioned bench contributions were seeing that tonight in the first half too thats a lot because Harrison Ingram and Cormac Ryan and La kadoo all coming off the bench youre right good point heres Shrewsberry Braden cant buy one from distance nice recovery and stick back for Tay Davis and thats not a shot BR Shrewsberry normally misses an ACC play hes having three made field goals per game Ingram will draw the foul on the drive and another look at Harrison Ingram who is only a hes a 40 threepoint shooter if there were a Mr versatility award in the ACC it would be 55 in white he would absolutely be the guy win that award hes been really good hes really come on and he gives him a little bit of everything perfect fit when he shoots it hes really yeah absolutely perfect fit and one one of the main reason why hes a perfect fit is you look at the graphic you see the 107 rebounds per game at ACC play had 19 rebounds at Inc state so with one of the things you know about North Carolina they always have an emphasis on rebounding the basketball offensively and defensively he fit right in with that little Runner with a for RJ Davis 11 now for Davis on his fifth field goal but hes done all of his damage really in the paint hes been attacking the basket finding ways to get shots off without really having to run offense for him to get those looks and its been great for him coming playing off the ball thats the big thing this year hes off the ball much better they much more comfortable here is Davis driving bake out off the last of slap heres Ryan with Ingram to his left hell dump it Ingram will take off Baseline a little Euro in for the hoop now this play WD coach Bay High this is the reason why amond Bott is on my first team all ACC because he does it defensively its not because he grew up 30 to 18 Carolina by 12 you were talking about Armando bots defense a moment ago well weve talked about North Carolinas defense in the entire season but when you consider why theyve been so great coach Bean will tell you great defensive teams have great Communications from their big men and they have Rim protection they have shot blocking and they have rebounding Armando Bott has supplied that for North Carolina this entire season and thats where they get out and thats when theyre really good heres the drive Shrewsberry the score braddens got four on a pair of field goals Carolina now right back at him offensively thats the one thing you know when youre going to play against North Carolina theyre going to run or makes or misses you have to be prepared to get your team back boy B Cory oh hes tough as they get WD no question about but hes above Bott he doesnt have any problem mixing it up amongst the trees and you see even if he has mistakes it doesnt stop him he continues to put his head down and get to the paint heres and this is is Carri boo you know hell pull the trigger into traffic Fall Away short against B good defense there was say it again coach defense Davis Runner too strong B the rebound spins back through traffic cant finish Ryan tried to collect against his old team now Shrewsberry with Terry Booth and he cant finish and Ingram somehow saf it smart play by RJ recognizing with Arondo running the the floor as hard as he has get him the basketball giving him opportunity to get his hands on Ingram foul line got it haram seven for Harrison Ingram the lead is 12 largest to the Ball Game for Carolina mostly come from defense Imes Iris need a bucket here Imes out of the corner and it ratts out Ryan Races by Booth tried to score and it bounds away carry Booth the foul itll be his first it is six on the Irish Harrison Ingram we talked about how he gets hands on the basketball that time has great hands to save the basketball from going out of bounds and then Sprints the floor finds himself in scoring position knocks down the easy 17footer at the top of the key four for Cormac Ryan the grad student from New York City and the first one good Ryan has had six games in the ACC where hes made at least three field three threepoint field goals he had six cor as you know in the win at Virginia and led the tar Hills and scoring in that game scored 18 of their 50 4 points but thats the been the difference with this North Carolina team we know what RJ Davis can do we know what Alondo B can do however right the leading score against NC State on Saturday was Harrison Ingram theyve got so many different guys that can hurt you but they all play so well together Ingram had 22 these these guys are veteran players too thats dont dont have them forget that heres Burton against Washington bot went to coach Daviss bench a moment ago seven to shoot here Shrewsberry Quick Pass inside rer up strong Washington bothered it and they scramble out of there Here Comes Around tar Hills trying to extend their lead now at 14 look at Ingram variety of spins carries him into the lane and scor a mismatch took advantage but he ran back letting Corb run know that hes too small to guard me just gave the too small sign on the way back like hey I can do this whenever I want nine for Ingram and its coming to flurry here Burton on the drive and a foul called its going to be on Jaylen Washington itll be his first its five on the tar Hills but the lead is 16 and Harrison Ingram behind this Cory WD going back to the basket shooting the fade away but more importantly running down the floor talking to his teammate hes too small when youre great your game does the talk in the ACC our speaks volum three of the last eight NCAA championships 99 NCAA tournament wins since 2015 eight NCAA titles in the last 22 years six of the top 30 winning his programs in division one most of any kind Burton takes this three he misses RJ Davis comes down knocks down the three ball then gets a steal its been an 184 run drada ever since yeah I mean its its confidence for a freshman to shoot that shot but they have a two onone he makes a pass they get a layup its tied I mean thats such a turnover when they go turn around when they go down and make the three I mean it changed the whole complexion of the game and you know when youre on the road youre playing the team as good as North Carolina right you cant have that kind of play its just hard to back from along the way Carolina for the 17th time in 19 ACC games has built a lead of 10 or more points in the ball game they and they do it with their defense y you consider the fact that this team has been especially in this building they only have one blemish this year in this building and that was a loss to a very good Clemson team here right when they after a big Duke win here yep now this one of the things that if weve been not brought up yet but many people look at this as a trap game considering that with the Duke game coming up on Saturday at Duke would they let their guard down here against no today I think reason they wouldnt is they had time off so they really able to get ready for this game and theyre just making some shots now when they make shots and play defense which theyve done all year play defense thats why theyre in first place Washingtons got five by the way the lead is Blossom to 17 Notre Dames going better than 3 minutes without a field goal Irish are just one of their last seven theres Burton on the drive Ryan block it so let me tell you the irony behind that play WD corm Ryan picks up Marcus Burton you see the jersey number on both these guys yeah if corm Ryan spends his sixth year at noted aame Marx Burton cant wear that Jersey you see what Im saying thats why there was so much violence in the boock oh my goodness you got my gear heres shrew be youre wearing my uniform yeah youre wearing my number six for Braden Shrewsberry theres RJ Davis through traffic that was sandwiched and Davis is hurt look out down heres JR kesn going hard to the basket Zona squeezes through he will score they will stop play RJ Davis I think banged his elbow Crow One a foul Applause called the senior for White Plains New York got sandwiched on the drive here I think was a good Applause play I mean I think the guy makes a good play got good position makes the block he just when you block it like that you go down hard and he you know he went down hard and I dont think he about that and you see one of the things with that and again is just the basketball Nuance when youre going into traffic and you jump off of one foot you cannot control the way you go down you cant you have go up with zero balance so when you go off of one foot and when you get knocked backwards youre going to fall how do you brace yourself and on that possession RJ puts his elbow down that takes the run of the Fall Davis being tended to by Carolina basketball athletic trainer Doug hon good thing for RJs left elbow wont affect the trigger at all Ryan working against kesar those are two guys familiar with one another and stripped and fouled and its going to be on Zona I believe are they going to call no JR kesn from South B went the St Joseph High School his first its the eighth on noted a so free throws and cormack Ryan to the line for one and one hes got six in this first Music half well they call the twoot foul so the allly ACC womens basketball tournament tomorrow in Greensboro starts every matchup up until Sundays Title Games right here on acc network coverage at 1230 Eastern tomorrow with our terrific nothing but net coverage Kelsey Ricks Muffet McGraw Kelly gramlick Ivory L will be there and well be underway with the Alli womens tournament and of course congratulations to Liz kley who won the player of the year award for the third time today and to Felicia Legette Jack whos done a marvelous job uhhuh thats Syracuse and also not the name yep Hanah hogo Hanah hogo defens Player of the Year and ACC Rookie of the Year question will she be the national Rookie of the Year over Juju wat look out rer missed the chippy noted a down 14 with 70 seconds to go first Applause half and kadoo out front all right Im going all right right there coach you see all that open space the right hand going to call the foul on the Move Bott its his second sixth on Carolina thatll bring Washington and RJ Davis back into the lineup for Hubert Davis however when youre standing at the top of the floor like that and you see only one other player on the right hand side you dont want to run that pick and roll going to your left you want to blow the doors off of this guy in front of you can beat one guy either they help and you kick to your shooter or you get all the way to the rim for layup Burton and hes going to get ticketed with an offensive foul on Marcus Burton nine now on the Irish as the coach was said come on and once you see the left arm extend that is going to be an offensive foul great job by SE Trumble getting into legal guarding position and of course you thats also a foul you have to sell youre not going to he was also moving way before the elbow came out seven turnovers on Notre name but 20 to shoot heres Ryan scooping and scoring nine now for Ryan Dane Goodwin is now kicking the TV as hes watching this watching his former teammate go up against his alma mater as well as Prince Hub that entire rexer him in there you throw Rex in there how about John Mooney you want get Mooney some back you want to go here I remember fluger from the corner would wear you out heres Ingram in transition tremble Davis three heres tremble at the horn from three nope too strong and thatll get us to the half 16point lead for Carolina here coach yeah I mean they not didnt gave him a fight but they just too many mistakes too many transition per in the first half tar Hills the ball and this lead H is back on the floor for the Irish to start the second half with Burt Shrewsberry along with J and carry through theres double figes how important is it when you draw up something and half time locker room to have that type of execution on the first playoff and then you make the shot which is even a lot better but Ryan and Ingram get going and they both got nine North carins not going to get beat on this part heres im looking on the bounce inside Jai against Booth two Big Fellas bang away look at the left hand turn too strong by J and here is kadoo trying to create a path all the way in and no whistle thought they were going to get one heres Burton the other way against Davis who reaches in and just stops traffic foul on RJ Davis his first the first on the tar here and this is a great play coming out half time they got everything set up throw it back reverse It Wide Open three and he can make those and when he makes those theyre hard to beat yep corack Ryan to a dozen just ahead of RJ Davis and there is a foul on kdo for a hole second on the Freshman Carolina is physical now theyre going to theyre going to bang you this year thats something a little different from what weve seen and thats the thing about good defensive teams they are physical often times they get called for those fouls however then the old Gary Williams fashion coach if you foul on every play they cant call all the them garyd be mad if you said that thats a Georgetown play Davis a long three 14 for RJ Davis thats his second triple Shrewsberry tries to answer it bounds away who got the rebound but ji and a foul on Bott trying to leverage him inside for his third and the Third on Carolina but RJ Davis is about Hubert Daviss lap here this is the spot where he hit the careerhigh 36 point and its also the spot where he got over that went 39 against Miami he loves that spot on the floor in front of his teammates and who they love to celebrate every time RJ does that thats the Caitlyn Clark spot who by the way is a great player yeah well I dont think theres any question of that minute and a half in here is Burton back for Shrewsberry this lineup is familiar to Notre Dame fans it starts here in the second half this is the lineup Michael shrewbury went to to bring eyeses on the floor to essentially run the offense and let Burton be a little more free and it also coincides with when Marcus Burtons progress really took off in his first season and the five out of six winning streak for noted a where they played so much better down the stretch but the most important part of that is the fact that they had lost seven straight games going going into that to be able to get a young team to respond that way that is a great coaching job by Michael shry and his staff yep and that back down against Bott is not going to work yeah that that thats a play they need to get rid of for tonight that is not working against the the fifth year sixth year Senor just he just been good for a really long time that ball got knocked away J goes to the deck Ingrams right there with him Davis is there for the help possession will stay with the Irish but unfortunately Notre names going to only have a half second to put a shot up we talked about the defense of Armando Bott and that was an errant pass thats not one that J is going to really be able to get to but Bott does a great job deflecting the pass and putting Notre Dame in a position where they only have a half a second on the shot clock in your mind is he one of the leading candidates for defensive player of the year in this league no that that race has been over I do believe hes First Team all defense in ACC this year though I do believe that Als been the best defender in the ACC this season and for that reason and the fact he also averages a double double was the only ACC player to do so the only way you can have an all ACC T is if you can have eight guys cuz theres eight guys that should but we have four that I think we all agree on is Elliot K attacks the basket going off the bounce the hoop the harm and the opportunity for the N1 WD yep terrific move by kader his second field Applause goal look at this drive what do you got here Jim thats just good move huh you know the kids really plays like a veteran player he I mean he knows how to play the game of basketball he doesnt make a lot of mistakes if any and you know theres certain things he cant do yet but he does not make mistakes and he gets the ball to people thats what he does hes had five double figure games against the conference he had 19 in Miami Cy and had at 17 against NC State on Saturday he was the second leading scorer was Harrison Ingram and Elliot Kad that provided the offense yeah fourth in the ACC against the conference by the way an assist to turnover ratio and thats a travel by J and Notre Dame another turnover here defense is just too good yeah but one of the reasons why the defense of North Carolina is so good is because everyone of course in todays game runs pick and roll action right when youve got a center that can not only switch and guard guards but also can hedge or play Drop coverage the versatility of Armando Bott defensively makes North Carolina so good especially when you got really good perimeter Defenders like Elliot kados SE tro and cor m l tar Hills on an 8 nothing run to start the second half uhoh there we go I can shoot who said I cant shoot on senior night he has the green light third three of the year for Bott in his ninth attempt Booth can answer the lead is 27 got to thats a good look I like that transition three simply because momentums on your side and youve got a great shooter walking into a good look and when you miss it it doesnt hurt you at all because you can get back and set your defense Burton trying to use the Zona screen The Weave through by the freshman and proof lost it turned over by the Irish thats going to be 11 now on uh Notre Dame or nine beg you pardon on Notre Dame Carolinas got five in the game you see heres tremble into the line up and Michel Shrewsberry arms folded now there have been nights like this in his first season for the Irish however the bigger picture is still in play here for his young basketball team yeah I mean hes done a great job the teams done a great job they got three freshman two sophomores out there against a veteran team theyre not going to compete against them unless they play at a crazy level they just did Noth count is not going to let you play at that level because of their defense Withers back to Davis 12 to shoot Zona trying to help heres RJ all the way through bounces for Trimble five on the clock Trimble backing down against Burton Fall Away Baseline wow North Carolina has done this to a lot of people in this building dont yeah the lead is 29 and a foul on tremble will get us to a break Im going to let Cory Alexander since he had so many fallway jumpers at Virginia well I I did shoot the follow away but not like this sep Trimble going over the right shoulder falling down knocking down to three ball but WD I take more pride in this my young fella knocking down a three ball Im so excited when youre great your game does the talk in the ACC our speaks v a lot but defensively Cory theyre fourth in scoring defense first in field goal defense first in threepoint field goal defense in ACC play they are the best defensive team in the ACC throughout this season but the reason is because look at how many different guys were showing defensive highlights of all of their starters were involved in those plays coach you Davis has his group on a string defensively thats why theyve been great this year thats their whole key from the beginning and the first time we were here long time ago their defense was good its still good maybe even getting better and its because they can all switch in the four one through four spots and they just keep guys in front of them and they still got bot back there if they need help Washington trailing for Applause three eight for Jaylen Washington on his second triple the lead is 32 and Notre Dame hasnt scored here in the second half and thats a dimension that Hubert Davis really hasnt used much of this year with playing Jayla Washington and Armond Bott together but when you see Washingtons ability to shoot the basketball that may be something that helps his North Carolina team as they move forward in the postseason Burton fouled on the drive Carolina and Hubert Davis are having an offensive Clinic 16 points six of eight from the floor and whats the opposite of a offensive Clinic oh for there you go that is exactly what Michael Shrewsberry has had to deal with here in this second half and offense has been a struggle for Notre Dame all season long but they have picked up some some momentum as of late as these young players have grown more comfortable yeah and this goes back this isnt really Notre Dames fault its North Carolinas defense you know its just one of those things theyre just too difficult to go against if youre Michel Shrewsberry you got to process that tonight though you youre playing one of the best teams in the country right if when youre going through it youre youre not youre not processing youre youre anguishing over there thinking is there anything we can do just to get something going here so that just just doesnt keep running away from this I dont know if there is Washingtons got double figures tonight for the first time since he had 11 points at Syra against Syracuse he also had 1 minutes against Clemson earlier this year hes playing a lot tonight theres the first field goal of the second half for JR KES lead is 30 with 6 minutes gone here in the second half and they really havent had to use much offens of RJ Davis however hes going to find a way to get involved into the mix unable to get the midrange jumper to go down he wont have to get 42 tonight n it doesnt need it got the pink shoes on I understand so they tell me Kan prepared yes he did in case the Gamers were needed theres a spin and move B Burton almost finished that Washington clears now RJ Davis got it to tremble on The Wire look at the move Withers and last Touch by the Irish says AJ Cai thatll bring Ingram back for Carolina booth in for Notre Dame with about 7 Minutes gone here in the second half but look at the lineup now you have the opportunity to go to Ingram as your small forward so youve got Washington Withers and Ingram on your interior that is a big front line when you got guys like Seth trumo and RJ Davis in the back court and its a front line theyre going to need as they move on into the tournament season how important is that coach to be able to have all those different lineups and the versatility especially when you get to the NCAA tournament and see teams that youve never seen before with B going to get in fou somethings going to happen Washington has to be there for the in tournament long rebound handled Shrewsberry from the Davis Miss Braden will pull up and hit and thats really been what not has been missing Bren Shrewsberry averages close to 14 points per game on the road hes the guy that they normally depend on for a lot of their scoring and he hasnt been able to get going here this evening cant get a shot he cant get a shot its not that hes missing he just cant get a shot Withers on run first points for Jaylen Withers now Shrewsbury came into Syracuse and made six threes four in a row in the second half and not easy threes either but this wasnt easy from Zen Withers in WD where we talk about in the park as he put that spin on it thats that spin on it right there you can call it English you call it whatever you want but its a good bucket for jayen Withers Withers at the line is an 81 free throw shooter Carolina tonight at the stripe six 10 after the make there his dad by the way terrific player was three times All Conference USA Curtis Withers at Charlotte for the old 49ers you play with dink Byron dink I think he may have been in Henry Williams Byron yeah that was a good Henry you back that youre talking about some of the best players come from the state of North Carolina well I I I had a little experience with North Carolina Charlotte had experience with guy named horn oh wait a minute nobody knew who he was when we went down the plan we beat Tennessee Ernie and Bernie show and then we saw cornbread the next game that was over early real early what about Chad kinch did he wire you night he had about 28 yeah Chad kench Cornbread Maxwell I thought I thought we were good I thought we had a really good chance after beting Tennessee and we didnt even have a chance quick quick reminder to you the Alli womens tournament from Greensboro starts tomorrow coverage at 1230 with our nothing but net crew 100 tip time at the coliseum in Greensboro by the way its always good when we travel with beheim to see the look on his face when you bring up certain schools it well I mean we we talked about they all beat thats the problem no you won in 75 came in Wes showed you the picture of Phil four playing against the orange at 75 called out every player yeah I saw Phil in the in the in the tunnel I said hey coach beams looking for you said you havent talked to him since 75 great player we got lucky Jim Lee in my nightmares yeah and theres a foul after the missed shot thatll get us the timeout Carolina in control eight 28point lead for Carolina great to be with Coach B Im and Cory Alexander you know these senior nights can get a little tricky walk on start things like that opponent comes out hot things like that you know like two years ago building you were here right yeah here I dont remember that you you werent here for this shot by Caleb love gave Carolina the lead hey jg3 Cory oh yes hes getting it on right now at overtime look there theres our man and then love on the drive and one 8879 in overtime yeah I remember that now thank you now that we bought it up now do you want me to bring up some things about you to all right okay were going to go there coach I thought you did an excellent job in that game getting Cole Scher the basketball 39 points for Cole Scher he tried to ruin senior night here he did he played great he got a contract too yes he did got TW got a twoway in the NBA from that back in no good for Tate Davis you got to look at the bright spot of everything it that was the bright spot and from the Carolina perspective coach they won that night in overtime nobody was giving them a chance three days later in dur if they if we have won that game I think it might have just turned them right out they might not have beaten Duke they might not have gone anywhere maybe its funny like that right you never know a Scramble now were going to have a foul AJ decide a pick them play here its going to stay with Carolina the foul will be on the Irish is it on Burton if so itll be his third I wasnt going to mention that Cory got his letter sweater tonight either but now he cant help hes been here hes 11 and0 in this year it is it has become a bit of a talking point yeah I mean some of the Carolina fol all the fans over here are giving them presents for the game exactly is it my senior night can I not come back thats the concern youll be back next year dont worry yeah you my co years missed Ingram slapped it out and he see ell K understand that he could actually go get that one because it was tipped into the back door Skipper Ingram fresh 20 for Carolina here goes tremble into traffic and out back for Ingram with under 10 CA use Bott Ingram a triple and Ryan rebound look at Cormac fight cant finish they scramble again Ingram of course think about how long this possession has been defensively for the Irish I havent seen cor Ryan do that in four years again hes playing against his former team hes playing against a couple of that he practiced against hes got to make sure that they he know that he left for greener passion well kesn Zona and a couple of guys toward the back of the bench he is Tony Sanders would be guys hes really familiar Applause with heres Pon kesn of three and Jr kesn knocks in his second field goal hes got seven all here in the half its got to be a little weird though for corack Ryan doesnt it yes it absolutely has because theres a lot of people that you know and you love in that organization in the program at noted aame and cor Ron had a great run for the Fighting Irish yep but he has also established himself as a strong member of what theyre doing here in North Carolina which could be a team that we could see in the final four National Championship under 10 stolen by Kau lead for Ingram working on booth and cant finish it Davis the rebound for the Irish great job by Booth getting back defensively and more importantly not foul yep I think cor M Ryan has no regrets about being at North Carolina none whatsoever all right and it goes back to an early season statement by Hubbert Davis as you see Tay Davis score for the Irish it it leads to the impact of the portal and we talk about Harrison Ingram for br in terms of fits perfect fit both guys fit perfectly and when they play well nor Carolina is hard to beat Dave RJ and and B theyre going to play game theyre going to be there K is a solid player its those two guys that make this team very hard to beat and Coach one of the things you mentioned earlier we start talking about the bench production we did bring up the fact that when North Carolina was losing three out of the six games in the middle of the ACC play SE trle was in yeah and they did not get that bench production that they normally get is not only from the offensive end but defensively he is really their best one ball Defender and him missing throughout those games was a big loss for the part well you look at some their losses I mean look Syracuse has struggled a little bit at times theyre a good basketball team we shot 63 to beat North Carolina by three points and theyre the best defensive team in the league thats the kind of game you know that happens to you that doesnt mean theres something you did wrong Tar Heels bring RJ Davis and Paxton loic back to the floor to join Bott Harrison Ingram heres Jaylen Washington for arando Bott I will note Tay Davis is another guy now the sophomore transfer from SE Hall Cory hes now eight double figure games against the ACC including his last four he has been the guy thats been a Difference Maker we talked about the production of Burton yep but Tay Davis has been the Difference Maker for a noted a down the stretch because he gives him a consistent interior threat not always back to the basket shooting the three as well but he gives him that force in the paint tend to shoot for kesn and heres Carri boa three and theyre going to call Washington for the foul Jaylen Washingtons got 10 tonight thats his second eight on Carolina so free throws coming up for keev Jai who will go to the stripe here for a one and one oh the fans in the stands dont like that one the referees but they they do love the fact that well this is a one and one uhoh so it wont matter but on a two shot fou ding into that end oh yeah my favorite thing crumble cookies cookies come into play you usually get those dont you somebody brings those to I find a way to get cookies normally while Im here Ive noticed that uh Cory gets the cookies coach but also to that line he and Dave OBrien I think got like pregame ballet service on the cookies I dont well you know I share I share Im not Im not a selfish well its because Daves a Syracuse guy so taking care of you know the Virginia guy thats all there is to it the one thing you know Dave ori is not bringing me cookies Im the one Im the one bringing the cookies and sharing them Obie enjoys the cookies yeah Ingram heres Ryan lead is cut back to 20 now on the three by Booth a moment ago now heres Cormac attacking all the way to the basket couldnt finish on the scoop and it will belong the noted aim but were going to get a timeout lead is been as as big as 32 in this second half when we come back well youre going to hear a lot about all ACC next week and coach and Cory and I Grassroots we all submitted and we have a consensus top four RJ Davis we all believe hell be the player of the year Tigers PJ Hall and the other two guys should be no surprise Hunter Salis of Wake Forest and Cory like Defensive Player of the Year Reese bman of Virginia so were set on those four the difference starts when it comes to the fifth guy so Ill go first since my guy is on camera for me it will be Armando Bott not only because hes the only guy in the ACC averaging a double double 14 points and over 10 and a half rebounds but also because of what he does defensively he for the best defensive teams in the ACC that is why I believe he will be first team I think hell get voted in because hes a senior and you need a big guy but I think Judah minz is second the league in scoring second and assist second and steals right in that area number one in free throw attempts it just has had a great year I really think you have to have eight guys because I think your guy my guy and and uh you know Wes even picked a guy so even West West guy you know you got to have Henson and you got to have Wess guy I I like look Kyle filipowski was a preseason Player of the Year Duke is going to finish either tied for first or second in this league yeah I I agree with you wholeheartly but I can say this I cannot say that throughout the entire season that Kyle filipowski has been the best player for the D I think Jared McCain has been their most consistent guy Jeremy roach has stepped up and made big plays and big shots for them Mark Mitchell has been dominant down the stretch and theyre at their best when tyres brocker is playing well well so they have so many different guys that and again if they finish one or two in the ACC you know you would expect for there to be a Duke guy on the list yeah but I think its been a team effort for the blue do I I think also you got 15 teams in the league now we used to have nine teams and Pick Five Guys now you got 15 its hard to pick Five Guys B fouled on the way up that was Davis I think Kevin J by the way went to the bench a moment ago on his fourth RJ Davis who by the way has five or more assists for the sixth time in his last nine with trying to tea up B out here but RJ averaging 217 points per game but also over 100 assists and that those are nice numbers because again as coach mentioned he has been off the ball more so this season than he was a year ago with Elliot Kad coming in and really taking over more of the primary ball handling responsibilities but RJ has still been a playmaker when hes not scoring hes dishing hes also the leader of this team unquestioned leader hes vocal he they respect him two new guys at the forward spots Kau is new right its been his team and hes LED this team and and I think he has to get a lot of credit for the lead is back to 24 Notre Dame had it down to 20 Carolina went through a blitz to start the second half and the Irish have been fighting back ever since and have not been able to really get in the ballpark here in the second half tar Hills trying to win for the sixth time in their last seven it would be their fifth straight look at Davis B here its a three and RJs got a chance for the rare fourpoint play but just look at the celebration RJ makes the shot and of course thats absolutely important but more important look at his teammates come over they all have the same celebration this is a team that is connected he and Harrison Ingram celebrate together corack Ryan gets involved Zaden high on the bench the same celebration this team is connected which is one of the reasons why theyve been one of the best and also they get great ball movement they help each other they screen for each other dribble hand do Bott sets the screen gets some open theyre doing all that all year 10th double double of the year for Harrison Ingram on the stick back and just like that Marcus Burtons jumper rattles out with five and a half to go the tar Hills looking at win number 24 it would be their 16th in the league and bacock fouled as he went up on the shot so couple of free throws coming on the Notre aame foul and its on tay Davis itll be his third dont forget the nothing but net crew starts our coverage tomorrow from Greensboro at the Ally ACC womens tournament first round all day and night pre and postgame shows highlights analysis interviews coverage you can only find one place its on acc Network and always available on the ESPN app looking forward to watching the event unfold at the coliseum in Greensboro Kenny Brooks in Virginia yeah Im trying to figure out my travel schedule if I can pull up on Sunday you know I was in the building last year I know you I was on the floor celebrating yeah Applause nice hope Elizabeth kitley HD player of the year is okay injured in the and congrats to Maho oh yeah Virginia getting the win over Virginia chech with RJ knocked down the three ball my goodness eight game this year with 20 or more points and five or more assists and another 13 to0 run after not Dame was able to get it to 20 yep Carolina pushes the lead back to 33 HS had it stripped out by Davis under five to play and 10 to shoot for the Applause Irish and hell go to the de held ball Carolina will get it on possession RJ Davis Cory hes got 22 well he broke the record this year beating out Justin Jackson for games with multiple threepoint field goals and this time he is enjoying it as thats like a Zen three from jayen Withers on the sideline very calm cool and collected I am uh I I got to tell you you watch him play and the full package offensively is really impressive by RJ Davis and theres on drop largest lead of the night again now for Carolina at 35 oh Zona three will bounce off Davis the rebound well I can tell you right now WD RJ Davis Amando Bott they better get their best looks here because I believe his nights about to be over for those guys hu Davis going to give them an opportunity to get their Standing Ovation yep yeah they got a game Saturday too yes sure do and and finally control by carry boo Jim as a coach when you know youre seeing a player on the floor for the final time whats that feeling like fans have theirs what does a coach feel you know youre just youre happy you had him and you know you hope he goes on has a chance to do something in basketball but youre just happy you had that guy I mean an RJ Davis you know Bott those guysre the cornerstones of your program and you know I had Derek Coleman and you know guys like Pearl you know so many guys and when they Applause leave well our Star Stories tonight are players that are crushing it and its brought to by crush and were going to start with a guy who we think will be the ACC Player of the Year and thats RJ Davis Cory with 22 tonight going to be interesting see if hes unanimous however corack Ryan showed up big time 14 points for him as well as Harrison Ingram but Jaylen Washington amondo Bott theyve got Five Guys in double figures right now yep and Bott teing up another one let him go baby get him out coach stand up Bas and get him out there it is time out on the floor will get us to a timeout let me shoot it Armando bacot just knocked down his second three of the night to make it 84 to 46 just like you taught him CA the most passion the most Cory Alexander basketball school baby seventh grade this is my guy he came into the gym and we worked on shooting and Roy Williams who recruited him and B to the University of North Carolina love seeing Mondo knocked down a couple this game now Saturday hes going to open up at Duke with one and its going to be an air ball and thatll be the end of the threepoint shooting free throw by Logan Imes is good but here we go this is what weve been here for AO replaces AR B and Music and nothing like this is there Jim when they leave the floor for the last time its you and the player and the relationship and everything right yeah its its just great when you have a great game on senior night and everybodys happy and everybody goes home happy thats theres nothing better than that irs got the free throws aako is the Young man from Maiden head in Berkshire England and he plays tonight for just the 12th time this season Rob Landry is a Legacy by the way his dad Pierce played for Coach Smith in the late 90s and so is kraton Leo and Bounds which sits on the shot clock the hustle will keep it with the Tar Heel and before we leave here Im just going to say happy birthday to Julie beheim who takes care of me and gets me to all these places the and if it wasnt for her I wouldnt be

tried to bank one home a COO scrambles in inside Zona might have gotten away with the wall might have might have gotten away well and heres the moment when you get this its its different thats why we asked coach so much tonight about this this is a special moment and tonight with Hubert Davis and Armando Bak Cory it speaks to the value of that relationship you go back six years ago when Hubert Davis was going to IMG to recruit Amo Bon the assisant coach those guys have been together for a very long all time and also RJ Davis as H reel looks on as there is a chance for cookies here in the building the only thing that makes this senior night any better is if everybody gets cookie Zona missed the first for the cookies y everythings going right and the happiest guy in the building oh yeah is the other Hall of Famer in here tonight would that be Roy oh Roy Roy Ro shes happy yeah want some cookies on the way home and theres coach Williams and when you think about it Roy Williams was the head coach when Armond Bott came here RJ Davis came here right so that is pride on his face to see how this program has gone with those guys in charge but also he is proud of Hubert Davis who he bought in as an assistant coach 12 years ago and to see the success that hes having as a head coach at the University of Virginia its a happy day for everyone here in Carolina well I think we need to
