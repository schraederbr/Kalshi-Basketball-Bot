The Possession trying to go strong back to the rim and he rolls it in hes a beast down low he carves out space thats what he does hes been hes been in a couple schools now hes a big part of the Syracuse team being a vet lamin just under 10 points per game theres a starting lineup for the Bucknell bison Noah Williamson is the big guy inside hes got the ball right now on the handle against Freeman into the paint series of moves and he lays it in oh Williamson hes been a lot more forceful down low hes known as a shooter but against Gonzaga he tried to take it to those bigs down low

he had a really good game last game four of nine two of five from three 17 minutes had 10 points hes a high level athlete that can shoot the ball wearing zero for the orange red shirt junor from Harlem New York playing in his ninth game this season gives it up B is going to force Syracuse to hit some threes today Lin again with an offensive forward on the weak side he is determined to get to the rim fancy move followed by cuff Jr the whistle stops play there goes that athleticism in warmups he was doing a lot of highle dunks Lan right here taking his time patient lost the ball a little bit but cuff junr coming in making an immediate impact I think thats why coach red got him in early for Elijah Moore wanted a little more energy offensively and defensively so cuff Junior at the free throw line has only been there five times this season and made three of them next week CW Courtside Saturday rings in the new year with a cant miss double header first inate Rivals Collide NC State battles Wake Forest followed by Cooper flag and number four Duke as they head to Dallas to take on SMU which has won six games in a row CW Courtside Saturday next week noon Eastern 900 am Pacific only

strong down lad thats a nice finish with the right using the rim to protect himself Freeman lampin power dribble turn around and score and score the bucket and foul lampin with the nice finish they dont have a n of length down there so he should be effective this game the determination of Eddie lampin early on for the orange as we step side from the Dome youre watching CW Courtside Saturday brought to you by All State youre in good hands about Music speci youre watching CW Courtside Saturday brought to you by All State youre in good hands John Griffin III in his second season is the head coach of Bucknell former player and Coach two trips to the NCAA tournament and Adrien ay from 1990 to 1994 and one of the great players in Syracuse basketball history still fifth in assists in program history I got to watch Adrien arry as a student I sat on the island which is right behind our broadcast position and I watch coach atrey do his thing on this court Co coach Griffin was the leader of arguably the best team in Buckner history beating Kansas the as AR top five in assist at a Legendary Legendary School in Syracuse I think its a little understood that they just played here they did great things for both of these programs coach Griffin II for the bison that win against Kansas sh in the 05 NCAA tournament they came right back the next year coach Griffin was on the team and they beat Arkansas 5855 in the first round so lampin unable to finish the old school threepoint play coach griffi has had to get no Williamson back in there I think thats the only guy thats going be able to handle Eddie lampin today inside thats a tough shot with lamin defending and Williamson couldnt find the angle nice play though still off the backside cant get a better shot for your you know player coming out of a timeout Freeman unselfishly into the corner step back jumper rattles home for the orange and Lucas Taylor Lucas Taylor he was two or four from threes last game he only hit two threes averaged 15 almost 15 points at Georgia State last year hes still trying to figure out this level up but hes important for a team that ranks in a bottom 300s of threepoint shooting percentage in this in the country and John what about the Freshman Freeman passing up the shot and finding Taylor hes a Doit all guy hes kind of become their Alpha while Starling is out on offense so that is going to Bow well for him you play good basketball usually good things happen for you on the other end as well JJ Starling missing his sixth game with a left hand injury expected back very soon according to the coaching staff Lin against the double team and he got the bounce I love the fire lamin brings to this Syracuse team that needs a little fire to come you know back into the program into their team this year turn over orange run it up Taylor R the you to Freeman who lays it in and a timeout bison off defense leading offense coach red Ary said that is what we want today to make us get this win nice turnover right here gets it down the court one dribble hes surveying looks up sees the McDonalds AllAmerican for a nice finish and the alleyoop to Freeman as well John Hensen a 90 Run for the orange fired up an emotional and inspired against Bucknell thats why basketball is a beautiful sport Donnie Freeman passes up to open three for the three he gets rewarded on the other end 13 points leading his team in rebounding the highest rated recruit since Carmelo Anthony thats a a tall task to live up to 2003 was a pretty good year around Syracuse New York with the Freshman Carmelo Anthony all the way to the National Championship I was blessed to see Carmelos I think first game in the garden against Memphis and D Rose me and my dad I had no idea who he was I I I I figured it out in about uh 10 minutes Kansas figured out who he was in that national title game good passing by the b in traffic and a foul is called its going to be a non shooting foul according to Teddy Valentine Donnie Freeman now thats the second on Music Freeman so Freeman is going to come out and lampin as well lampin right now John with hes got six points to lead the way freshman kind of mistake knowing you got one foul and the team needs you uh May should have stayed down on that spone gave it up out of the corner hes a transfer from Davidson College just north of Charlotte North Carolina scrap for the loose ball and a foul called Carlos just picked up the foul for the orange Carlos hes hes hes really Syracuse only true starting point guard so hes definitely going to have to stay out of foul trouble with the Syracuse team Williamson put it on the floor and lost the handle Carlos decides to wait for reinforcements n McLoud has come into the game for the orange number 10 7 fo4 big body that played a lot last year not as much this year but he could be effective today against the big seven footer from lva jier Davis had nowhere to go trying to set a screen for Carlos ja clocks at seven luckily bounced right to Cuff into the corner two players trying to run it down out of bounds and it will be Bucknell basketball close captioning for CW Courtside Saturday brought to you by Sketchers basketball comfort that performs that was a kind of a Helter Skelter offensive possession for Syracuse how about the schedule that Bucknell has put together in the nonconference they are coming off a trip to number 13 Gonzaga last Saturday they lost 8665 wi 10 of 31 on three point attempts coach Griffin said its simple we need more threes more twos on the inside from Williamson beautiful patient move by no Williamson getting the cloud to kind of Shield him towards the Baseline and turning with a nice left hook over his shoulder right shoulder bounces out for Taylor Elvin Edmonds brings it up for Bucknell tring to drive the lane over McLoud and thats not an easy thing to do definitely not an easy thing over the big seven foot a nice lefthanded finish hes the fourth I know the pressure that comes with I the fourth as well so good luck to him today John Griffin the fourth is also here the young son of Coach Griffin as that bounces out of bounds McLoud was the closest Orange player hes seeing action in his fourth game and had played only 11 total minutes before today coach ay might have to trust his freshman with foul trouble as the game is kind of turned in momentum wise to in Buck nils favor coach Griffin in his first year for Bucknell took his team to the semifinals of the Patriot league tournament against Colgate lost by three speedone hesitation in Drive perimeter work right through the defense and the Miss on the open layup by bosow was he surprised that he was that open John you know I think he was he probably hasnt been that open being their best offensive player All Season aay though thats what he does he rebounds he finishes their best athlete on the floor on the team really so Davis picked up the foul for the orange theres a lot of blue orange and white on the court today between the bison and the oranges that one Falls I was going to say if you like orange youre in luck we got orange shoes orange jerseys orange warmups theres a big giant orange s in the middle of the Court as well and by the way I was surprised to find this out John Henson this is your first trip to the Dome what do you think I love the environment its a good crowd the snow melted this morning so we were able to get in I short sleeve shirt weather out there cant ask for better weather at this time with the MU up here the sight of some amazing basketball and football and the cross for that matter the orange winning its ball game flash really wanted to shoot that one yeah get on him by passing that up getting a better shot potentially there go hanging and scoring skillful B has been down his his his his scoring is up but his percentages are down coach red taught us before the game said hes looking for him to get it going they need him to get it going yeah he challenged Chris Bell to perform up to his standard as Moore takes it back roic also into the lineup for the orange wearing number six in white got a little mismatch down low Carlos Movic ree ball is on that nice shot by Movic listen Syracuse doesnt shoot the will shoot the ball that well but if you leave him open like that he will hit that try to steal it back its Davis he goes to the court and a foul was called Chris Bell nice screen by mic pull up midrange jumper and look two thats too much space anybody can hit that shot up therere good enough and he did that just just that about Louisvilles Noah Waterman with a driving layup youre watching CW Courtside Saturday brought to you by fresh pet its not dog food its food food and by healthcarecom go new law lower

Bucknell orange have made six of their last eight shots and they are shooting close to 54 so far in the first half we Midway through Bell in the corner Rhythm dribble does not produce a ma jumper goes out of bounds and the officials say its bison basketball as Williamson comes back in for Bucknell its a nice offensive play they didnt make the shot but they got the ball side to side that spaces the defense out Buck nil played pretty good defense there bill got a nice shot but he definitely was challenged so its only the 12th meeting but there are some noteworthy items in this rivalry they played in the NCAA tournament John back in 1989 first round and a win for Syracuse 10481 that was in Dallas I was uh currently not available at that time so its a long time ago missed by Mo from the corner last meeting between the teams November of 2019 and a win for Syracuse 9746 the one win 25 at the dome for Bucknell coach John Griffin the third was a part of that team Williamson on the the block against Davis had the size Advantage good defense by Davis good defense by Davis chessing up oh B the save my stroage sometimes you get saved Master running the court Rim running right there made him available that is why you run to the rim on fast breaks he got rewarded sh just play 10 guys man this this is unusual thats a three bounces out BC quick down the court and unable to collaborate beyond the fingertips of Bell so Moore will step aside hell go to the bench with Coach ay cuff is back in we look at todays key play brought to you by Hilton Garden in Hilton for the stage on Elijah Moore with the l oh nope hes going to P over his shoulder I did not notice that that was kind of a no look great catch by the guys in the truck that was a nice play and great Hustle by marovich to get in position freshman from Serbia entry pass knocked away Davis playing some really good defense down on the big fella Movic running the floor that rolls off the edge of the rim fight for the loose ball three players go to the deck held ball situation the ARL favors Buck Nell official Tommy morresy right on top of that hes joined by Ted Val Valentine and fence Armstrong this afternoon inside the Dome its good to see cuff Jr getting some good minutes hes brought an energy to this game that maybe Syracuse needed you know on this kind of down or this l in their season losing five and six so marovic to the bench for the orange Eddie Lampkin comes back in coach arre is uh trying to talk to Elijah Moore a little bit to help him out maybe he ran a play wrong freshman woles hell be F so lamin is the leading scorer so far for the orange with six marovich has five hes on the bench and leading the way bosow has five for Bucknell bosow directs some traffic guarded by cuff Williamson from Ria lvia thats the capital of that country they kick it in the corner F gave it up and it leads to a three Jaden Williams nice paint touch kickout Swing Swing thats also part of hitting threes time making the right pass and getting open ones Jaden Williams got the double digits with 10 points in the game against Gonzaga last week thats a season high for Williams who just can that three lamin he has had bad intentions trying to get to the rim every time he touches the ball Twan game lost it on the way up as it got knocked away and deflected by mcre m lamin may have poked that one out of bounds trying to recover defensively Williamson is probably the only guy thats going to affect him down there he struggles with length lampin does he might have to play 40 40 minutes he hasnt played 40 but hes going to have to play a lot this game as coach Griffin said yesterday he fits the size and physicality of the ACC yeah lampin three years at TC and then a year in the Colorado program first year in a Syracuse uniform for Eddie lampin Jr the graduate student from Houston Texas Bucknell hanging with the orange trying to take the lead and the missing lampin with the rebound a onepoint lead for Syracuse Taylor drops it off Davis it on the way up threepointer hits the target from bosow we havent talked about him much today but hes their guy offensively and hes got two open threes Syracuse has to do a lot better I know he was on the Scout you cant let him shoot open threes hes shooting respectable 35 so he can hit those and hes got eight points three of eight from Beyond The Arc for buckell lin Rams into Williamson and scores I felt that in my chest Tom that hurt me so Im out of break wait a second man I mean we saw Eddie Lin play a couple of weeks ago at Notre Dame and he was a willing passer and played on the inside but hes a different guy today he is he was getting he gets double team sometimes and he is definitely an underrated passer when he had when he gets double team which is a helpful a b like that Williamson driving Davis altered the shot hes given up a few inches for playing solid D against some bigger players for buck got to get it to the big fella if they Syracuse hes got a mismatch Dave his Baseline L comes over the top and did it cleanly look if you wont pass it to me Ill go get it myself I like what lady lampin did right there drawing the foul on the offensive rebounds so well take a timeout tired to 21 CW Courtside Saturday Music of for CW Courtside Saturday game two 21 all inside the Dome we want you to ring in the new year with NXT dont miss the final episode of the Year NXT all new this Tuesday December 31st 87 Central right here on the CW lets take a look at the first half game stats brought to you by Sketchers Footwear stylish comfort for men women and kids John I like some Sketchers um my daddys trying to get me where when I was younger man I like it yeah um so Bucknell 42 from the field Syracuse 47 points of the paid the same rebounds the same I think the story of the game for Bucknell is they they arent turning the ball over much theyre theyre halfway to what they usually average so I I think having more possessions theyve shot the same amount of shots this is why were all tied up six turnovers so far for Bucknell Syracuse has eight Lins at the free throw line just 45 on the season for Eddie lampin by the way its great to have John Henson seated next to me also want to send a speedy recovery along to Mike jinsky who had some eye surgery Mike was supposed to be here in the dome John filling in on his birth working on his birthday his 29th birthday today right John yeah you know I I I used to work on my birthday when I was playing so this is no different its a lot easier though you just sitting watching the game here court side inside the Dome great place to be so we extend those witches to the Gman as Bucknell runs it up and theres a bump Movic in the vicinity Syracuse trying to Speed the game up a little bit trying to turn Bucknell over theyre bottom of the country in turnover percentage and offensive rebounding so when you cant get extra possessions offensively you have to be more efficient offensively cuse hasnt done that so far hence why the game is tied up at the moment buckell with a chance to go ahead on this possession BC got the defender in the air and rolls it in looks like they know Donnie Freeman their star freshman has two fouls and theyre going right at Music him Junior from walk Iowa averages just below 10 points per game fourth best on the team for fij Freeman got it back out to Taylor got it right back pumps up the Applause three on the wing this is a long distance three and it is money from Elvin Edmonds the fourth by the way good shot good Rhythm shot by Edmonds Syracuse needs to get a good shot in this possession they got it corner over his last two games Lucas is four six from three so far so hes starting to fit it a little bit made 64 threes last year at Georgia State and transferring into the Syracuse program BC offensive glass Raymond pulls it Applause down Carlos Nifty dribble hesitation and drive that was a nice screen by sh by movich to get his point guard to the basket goes unnoticed but hes got to than when he gets into the Huddle to hes done a lot of little things so far in this first half number six and white for the orange he has foul called on Carlos I think thats been the story of this half movich and Music cuff nice screen right here by Mich wow laid the wood on him set up the screen for the mismatch on the big AI could not stay with Carlos jayquan Carlos the senior from Brooklyn New York first year in the Syracuse program and a transfer from hru played all 40 minutes last Saturday against Maryland unfortunately just two points and three boards that was a loss for the orange Bosco before the shot there was a whistle looks like a foul on Bucknell you see the offensive confidence of buck nil kind of picking up a little bit something to watch for sit at home second foul on Beek theyre starting to believe that they can win this thing in the dome out here in Syracuse Tony you should mention that John their last win in the dome and the only win in the series history November of 05 they beat then number 17 syus 7469 lkin inside enforcing his will beautiful seal right there right here look at this seal no Williams had his back to him I mean he carves out the lane they might have to come double team him Tom he is uh having his way down there hes into double digits in the first half with 11 points and going to the free throw line Ed Lin Jr nine points 10 boards to lead the team on the glass in the loss to Maryland 611 270 when I played I wanted no Applause parts so thats an 80 Run for the orange Capp by the free throw and threepoint play from Eddie lampin Brad student from Houston Texas playing like a man on a mission today John got to take a stop by his restaurant hes got a little restaurant here I think the orange as they create the turnover realizing this is going to be some momentum headed to the meat of conference Play Its All Conference games from here on in Feed the Beast Taylor oh another three hes ripping the ropes for the orange or hit the three whatever you want to do T Im so sorry Applause hey so Taylor has made all three of his threepoint attempts now number three for Bucknell turned aside and Williamson on the double team how about this threepoint shooting by the orange who came in John at 29 as a team averaging just over 5 m threes per game theyre already there pretty much Happ his makes turnover lamin on the handle 44 lbs it into the court saved on the Baseline by Moore Taylor for three Freeman falling away with touch and finesse Freeman hasnt been much of a factor this half thats how you start sometimes get offensive rebound seeing the ball go in close hes got a nice Fade to if you watch him man he hes got game Syracuse by nine in the first half 130 Run for the orange tson in need of some points unable to harvest any on that possession Carlos creative move lampin lost the handle he got it back from the offensive glass two Syracuse players behind the play BOS thought about three good recover defensively oh how about the pass John Buck Nell taking their time knowing they had a man down I was just about to say good recovery and they got a layup so BOS to BC what a pass by BOS a little no look flare on that one as well was nice all right we go inside of two minutes remaining in our first half Tom wormy John Hensen are outstanding CW Courtside Saturday basketball production crew with you from the Dome Freeman Mr do it all talked to NBA Scout today they said that he would hes better suited for the pros than college so I dont know if hell be a Syracuse long so folks better enjoy him six made threes in the first half for the orange Collision midair thats going to be on lampin on the drive by mccre there is a Timeout on the court the orange with the the 10point lead inside the Dome against Bucknell Del is Music Applause Applause is El lets take a look at todays game summary its presented by Pacific Life creating Financial Security for nearly 160 years how about Eddie Lampkin so far John hes got 12 points and six boards Carin out space finisher with the right and the left hands hes been a beast today hes been a monster theyve got to figure it out maybe start double teaming him because if he keeps this up this will be a long day for the buck nail bigs oh willson kind of with the paint touch and a nice finish and BOS quietly having a really good game against this Syracuse team eight points for Bosco John in a couple of Threes And then the Run by the orange its 16 to2 over for the last 4 minutes theyve been making great plays great passes to each other in Rhythm threepoint shots that is how you hit the three in it todays game especially for a team thats struggling percentage wise does so lampin hes got the hes got the does he got the diamonds hes got the Lamar Jackson diamonds I love it thats kind of dangerous though man with the game going on he looking over at you saying are you watching me Johnson the physicality I think he was Im I I was in I was in Austin Texans till I was 16 man he might he might have watched me a few times I got something for you today is uh mccre is at the free throw line hes got another one coming so 3828 orange with the lead it represents their largest lead of the game 10 Applause points Carlos will bring it up for the orange five six on the season 0 and one in conference play their only ACC game was December 7th at Notre Dame and a loss 6964 JJ Starling is unavailable for that game as well and hes missing his sixth consecutive game hurt his hand in practice his left hand non shooting coach talked about how he had established himself as the offensive guys now theyre still trying to figure it out so he wants to let it happen organically and uh see where his team goes without his star player inside of a minute to go in the first half and the shot clock is down Applause five lampin the rebound pumps that basketball with the off hand too little emphasis Freeman Baseline 15 ft is a good distance for number one cant give him that hes got a nice nice midrange game nice Rhythm shot shout out to the Freshman getting back into the game after early foul trouble thats a sign of maturity Tom its not nine points now for Donnie Freeman The Freshman from Washington DC stay tuned for todays halftime show presented by Subaru love its what makes Subaru Subaru recap of Eastern Kentucky and Louisville went right down to the wire and the cards get another win after going on the road last Saturday and winning at Florida State well preview the Snoop Dogg Arizona Bowl highlights and stats from the first 20 minutes Bucknell and Syracuse 12th alltime meeting Syracuse already at their average of season for three its probably why theyre up 11 time and uh Buck Ms got to figure out offensively how to start running some stuff and and and hitting some shots and getting some good shots starting with no Williamson he needs to get more invol he tends to disappear sometimes as the game goes out of stretch hes got to get going so I will say for the orange John they did lose that game last Saturday against Maryland 8760 however from the three point line they were eight of 16 so they made eight against the terpens and at as you mentioned theyve already piled up the threes here in the first half against Bucknell this this token press that Syracuse is running allows Buck nil not to have as much time to run their set So Good by Syracuse kind of getting the clock down so they dont have to play as much defense in the half court bosow leads the way with eight eight points on three of seven shooting in the first half hes on the dribble against Taylor Williamson goes inside spone got fouled and hell go to the free throw line Jun got it nice pass by Williamson getting to the paint finding this guy cut in cuff lost sight of his offensive player spone the Junior from Geneva Switzerland and a transfer from Davidson College Swiss national team so you know hes hes got a lot of experience playing kind of with the professional guys over there so cuff and myovich come out of the lineup for the orange only 997 seconds to go in our first half of Applause Music play offense defense By Buck Nell and Syracuse thats mccre coming back in for spone who just made the free throws Carlos sasco on the Run kick to Freeman Dy is feeling it that was a clockwise swirl to the bottom of the net before the horn that looked good from his minute he released it dony Freeman man the all World freshman up his minutes and uh starts to get into our rhythm Freeman has two double doubles on the season one against Youngtown State and another against Colgate with 15 points and 12 boards this is Bell leaps into the lane Bell Challenge three Bucknell Defenders Challenge Accepted by by Bell from coach entry this past week hes been playing well today turnover threepointer Moore trying to save it does to Freeman against two Defenders got it back and then he threw it off of spone out of bounds I could have went bad man glad hes Applause okay orange maintaining Applause possession as John mentioned Syracuse made six threepointers in the first half above their season average just over five made add another one to the list not this time L could tried to run down the m by Moore this is bosow spone in the hustle spone had it blocked by Bell I saw that coming from a mile away got it back though got it back scores B lined it up like it looked like LeBron just cruising down the court and I mean this head was almost at the rim on that block opening moments of the second half Syracuse has won the last two meetings between the programs win in 05 in the dome for Bucknell for its only victory in the series Carlos Baseline shovels to Bell foul against the orange thats tough that was good Movement by Bell to relocate on the driveone Lost Vision this block right here look how high he gets I mean hes looking down on that fall syus has the ball back this is Bell gave it up more angling and kicking Carlos in the paint lost the handle mois trying to force it a little bit offensively hes just got to settle in Bosco lines it up and knocks it down some days its not your day and more as a freshman has to realize that Tom Syracuse has to be careful Buck Nell is top 75 in a pointment second half scoring so they have a pinion for coming back they have a pinion for coming back and sending the game into overtime they played Four overtime games this year theyre two and two and two of those games back to back were double overtime so they dont mind they dont mind they come back working overtime that right there was just a careless turnover coach AI has to sit down and put his hand on his head thats could not happen in a game like this when youre trying to get on the right path and win some games oh Edmonds Williamson Bucknell cans another three and just like that its a sixpoint game talked about it earlier bucks looking making me look good they do have a pinching for coming back theyve done it before and theyre trying to do it again today its a good start for them sixpoint game in the last minute 44 the orang has turned it over three times cant leave him open Freeman Williamson had the position against lampin up ahead thats a tough catch and travel now if that was football thats the first down two feet in so in the NFL too BG couldnt keep his footing close captioning for CW Courtside Saturday brought to you by Sketchers basketball comfort that performs once again we salute the orange for their victory in the Holiday Bowl yesterday against Washington State Fran Browns team won 10 games John 10 including the win against Miami in the last game of the regular season right here in the dome culture changer man you love to see it football is uh looks like theyre back CF the basketball program can continue the momentum as Carlos gets upended in the paint lamin getting after Bale I dont know if you hear at home he saying hes got a at the screen thats part of being a leader of the team holding your teammates accountable dont forget we start our womens ACC college basketball coverage next week with Stanford at Clemson Carlos twisting shooting and scoring hes been attacking the lane downhill the whole game right here Rips left rip through you cant give middle nice finish theyve kind of been letting him drive in the first half they were csing it seems like Im letting him drop so he cant find the open guys good on him to finish when theres no one there so Carlos couldnt finish off the threepoint play 73 on the season from the line for Carlos bedone a lot of dribbling stolen Freeman Telegraph pass I think me and you could have stole that time if we were see if the orange can convert that into points miscommunication and looks like hes going to take the Freshman out yeah coach otrey doubled over after that Miss Q trying to talk to him a little bit uh its tough freshman you got to keep your head up theres ups and downs Elijah Bos playing more than I did as a freshman tell you that if he has a career like John Henson hell be happy about that 14 turnovers so far in the game of the orangs thats Bosco creating a shot and getting fouled nice seal on BOS once you get The Man Behind to not let him get back in front its kind of translated from the pr game to the uh college game more and more first foul on Bell vosco at the line from Milton Ontario Canada Lin is telling his team to wake up I I skipped the word was in between there so hopefully it gets his guys going this is a family show John so Bosco who came into the game

448 got to get it to the big fella down there hes open tough driving help defense ball out of bounds that was a jaay who came over to help and he seems to be okay after an awkward fall and this is I think what coach ay was talking about right here Syracuse heres the block right here by a jaay whos the guy offensively should go to when you need a bucket I think they should have hit L they should evolve him on every possession until he stopped Freeman looks like hes going to the free throw line the orange just two of nine from the floor so theyll try to get some points from the strike for Freeman Williams has picked up his third personal for the Bison good job by Freeman realizing a mismatch smaller JD Williams on him and just cutting to the basket Donnie Freeman best free throw shooter on the team 83 seventh best in the ACC the start the day two shots Music Applause Music looking for a Cable News Network which respects all Americans then you have a new home with news Nation Cy news nation is Americas most trusted Cable News Network to find newsnation on your screen go to newsnation nowcom the headline in the dome was the threepoint shooting of the orange in the first half and the work by Eddie lampin whos now going to the bench for Syracuse 12 points and now Freeman one of two from the Applause Line This is an important moment for Syracuse a game thats getting a little tighter and they need to find a way to push through especially this will be good for ACC play when theyre playing a lot tougher opponents and Bucknell this is not their first rodeo they just came from the keno and Gonzaga so theyre tough and theyre not scared of this moment in Applause traffic that was cuff who came flying out and hes helped up by caros that Nas been the rup theyve been to the kennel I mean they uh they theyve ran the gauntlet of these power five teams looking to kind of give over their hump today maybe even get a win yesterday they had a practice in Lewisburg then drove the three and 12 hours on the bus and came to the Dome and had another practice so they could get the range and depth perception and shooting inside the Dome with a rim Bender Big Time athlete right there good hands by him as well that was a tough pass to Coral in thats probably the one shot that translates pretty well no matter where your playing D gets your team going gets a little ju your team as well Carlos retreats in the corner its been a turbulent second half so far from the floor for the orange J got a piece of that and we get a little reset on the shot clock to 20 I like the communication By Buck n when Donnie Freeman had the smaller on small on him they were yelling 55 which Im sure means be aware maybe trap or double team so the buck nail Legend coach Griffin Maric is in there Jer Davis 13 Carlos with the ball Taylor as well and not caugh Im shot clock dwindling Carlos movich tried to one armed rebound it goes right to coach ay and the official say thats bison basketball great defense By Buck n thats how they are going to theyre already back into the game but maybe win this game great defense by them making Syracuse move the ball so there is a timeout inside the Dome 1326 to go in our second half CW Courtside Saturday Herve always Applause ready e Applause Applause Applause I Applause back on the Syracuse campus orange by 5 after leading by 12 at halftime next Sunday the season premiere of CW womens Hoops as ACC newcomer and perennial power Stanford heads to Clemson to take on the Tigers Stanford against Clemson next Sunday 2 Eastern 1100 am Pacific only on the CW so lets take a look at the game stats brought to you by Sketchers Footwear stylish comfort for men women and kids John Buck Nell has closed the rebounding Gap significantly um and I think that is the story of the second half holding Syracuse in one possession getting the ball Syracuse right now they put lamin back on the floor theyve got Taylor out there I like up they had him before didnt really have any offensive guys out there hence why they were probably one for nine one for the last nine in the last three minutes so Bucknell shooting in the second half four of seven that includes two threepointers on two tries from Beyond The Arc the orange just two of 10 and they missed all four of their three attempts after making six in the first half little pick and roll by spone for the big fella isolation Williamson against Davis help from to good pass with find Edmonds love his patience down there good pass there we go lamin thats what Syracuse has to do you have to feed the big fella he hasnt been stopped all day right here this seal nothing can do about that whether youre 7 fet 69 Williams has to get back in there Williamson has to get fronted do his do his work early not let him get sealed under the basket keep an eye on that match up Williamson in the paint now against Lin with the basketball hes got two fouls too so he could be a little physical Taylor lost the dribbling Privileges and had to give it up to Carlos Nifty between the legs trying to finish it off was a million dooll move the Finish not the equivalent of that I think as the point guard Carlos has to make it a point to get it in to lamp that was a lot of dribbling and they got pretty much the same shot they would have got it they thrown it in little bit of a freelancing move there from Carlos who couldnt finish off the play Oh fancy behind the back to Williamson again the Finish was not the desired result got to got to there we go lampin position its funny how it works Tom you get the ball to lampin and something good Applause happens lampin comes up with a double with Carlos on speedone trying to step on through Fe yelling drive it to Edmonds William offensive glass against Applause Davis so Davis picked up the foul and some contact with Williamson its the orange by seven in the second half on CW Courtside Saturday Music youre watching CW Courtside Saturday brought to you by Pacific Life creating Financial Security for nearly 160 years p youre watching CW Courtside Saturday brought to you by Pacific Life creating Financial Security for nearly 160 years we will be going from the snowy Syracuse campus front of the Hall of languages T administration building Maxwell School of citizenship left to right to Arizona for the Snoop Dogg Arizona ball present Bowl presented by Jin and Juice Miami of Ohio against Colorado state that is next on the CW we cant wait what a day we started with Louisville Eastern Kentucky win by Louisville right here at the Dome and then to the Snoop Dogg Arizona Bowl not bad not bad at all six to seven 147 rebounds for offensive rebounds I hope coach arer is in the Huddle saying lets get the ball to big fella and go from there because he is a willing and capable passer he can get this threepoint shooting Spark by Syracuse as well Noah Williamson is at the freee throw line Noah Williamson had a double double in an overtime win against Richmond out of the 810 26 points 10 boards and five blocks as he stuffed the stat sheet Bucknell to get over this kind of five to sixo hump that theyre a part of theyve got to defend and I think Williams has to be a little more aggressive BOS should you know maybe run a pick and roll and uh go from there Carlos aerial pass cough The Catch and Release theres too much on it goes right to Davis oh he dropped it off and Bosco was the recipient of the post Christmas gift from Davis that was a nice hand off those are the best kind but he regifted at the other end gave it back to the orange oh a couple of players got tangled up Williamson and lampin both hit the floor lamin picked up a foul youre watching CW Courtside Saturday brought to you by healthcaregov new law lower prices en roll today you know thats a foul that uh as a coach I wouldnt be mad at aggression only a second foul let Williamson know Im going to be here all night here they go again Williamson got the shot away but lampin altered it good fisal defense by Lin puff does not have the numerical advantage and it doesnt matter y old Kyrie Irving rip through hes made that famous now everybodys doing at all Applause levels hours and hours in the gym perfecting those moves cuff coming down with the looks like hes going to go right oh Im coming back youre out of position thats two points cuff with three points in the game game thats his first field goal got a couple of rebounds as well Elvin Edmonds was down for a moment hes flexing that knee in the back court Buck Mill has to get a good shot dis possession one of eight in the last three and 330 thinka staro Bosco and Williamson Applause spone bco shot clock now at 10 this is what I like to see right here bco leaning in two strong Lin Ready Credit the wrong to Carlos for defending BOS so well he was all defense in the ca last year sheds his Defender and hits the jumper silky smooth Kyle cup Jr they did get must from him early in the season but the last two games he has been very effective for them just bringing energy offensively and defensively hes come alive now in the second half couple of recent buckets including this one Baseline Drive little pump fake step oh pull up thats beautiful looked like he might have been thinking about a drive then he backs it off series of he layered those moves John hon nice that was what we call a workout move to rip through ride pull up cash so thats five points for cuff Freeman has 13 lampin leads the way with 14 for the orange and lampin is six of seven from the floor Osco four for 11 Williamson three of 10 those are their two offensive stalwarts credit to Syracuse making it tough on them as I mentioned earlier credit to Carlos his confidence is growing after transferring up hes did a good job on Bosco Carlos who spent three years in the HRA program hes had a pretty good December hes averaged nine points and six and a half boards per game had 15 from the loss at home against Georgetown in the 100th meeting between those two programs in the dome this season saw some of those Old Georgetown Syracuse highlights turnover Carlos to the rim right on now this is this is crunch time for Bucknell I think thats where theyre struggling right now theyve really only got one ball handler and BOS and Syracuse has to be a little less aggressive you dont want to put them on the line as youre trying to take control of this game Music so now with that foul the Bison in the bonus so Williams to the free throw line Williams son to the free throw Applause Music line A J set to come in for buckell at the score SC table Lin having a nice conversation with ref Williamson just 59 of the season from the line hes got both of those bunell needed those points John they had fallen behind by 12 matching the largest lead of the game for the orange Williamson to the bench for now Co red bringing back his two reserves but he hasnt played a lot movich and cuff Jr in the game he might have found something there it goes eight points now his first three of the game and the first three of the second half for the orange bco the return weak side of J shoulder down to the how did he do it John now thats what you call a man right there that was a strong move by J doing what he does rebounding good board right here bodies oh he took him up with him too man thats 67 235 pounds from Calgary Alberta Canada cant finish off the old school threepoint play looks like it could be a defensive end after me only 35 free throw shooting for a j this season s has to continue to get good shots as the clock is starting to become their friend if they can just get a shot every possession this is this is how you start tough crosscourt pass but own tole did it and Coach ayy says we dont need that well Freeman has to draw the defense in a little more he didnt really look aggressive like he was going to score the ball so the defense is naturally not going to come in and they got to handle that pass out 39 seconds to shoot for the orange with 839 on the game clock nice draw up to for Taylor not going to get to the rim that will be a shot clock violation as indicated by Ted Valentine Tommy morresy and Clarence Armstrong Ted was refering my games at Carolina he told me thats how he know hes getting old and he sees me in the booth instinctively you immediately started arguing with him about a call from way back when right yeah uh Im sure you remember one Ive had some games with him so definitely remember easy board same Carlos and cuffer there stepping into the three Freeman offensive board and to the line Tommy morresy quickly separating the players is Freeman walks to Center Court Jim Bim Court 47 years as the head coach for the Hall of Famer hes recovering from knee surgery too we wish him well around the holidays told you Freeman the best on the team at 83 from the line a ja had picked up that foul helps to have a big man uh shooting at such a high percentage tell you what the orange hoping for a speedy recovery for that man as well JJ Starling started his career at Notre Dame was injured in practice a lefthand injury in practice few weeks ago we were at that game when they were on the road their on the other ACC game and he was shooting with the right so hes anxious to get back and what were told is very soon very soon so very soon May will it be Tuesday against wake probably not according to the coaching staff but hes making progress bco mccre rather the Miss Carlos Carlos has some daylight score it and to the line great transition survey by Carlos you can see Carlos coming down the court kind of surveying let me see oh nobodys going to pick me up let me just finish it Music Music Music Music G Applause lets take a look at todays game summary presented by Pacific Life creating Financial Security for nearly 160 years Cal cuff right here coming in bringing the energy offensively and defensively hes really helped Shore these reserves off the Bas for Syracuse seven points in the second half hes playing really well right now big pitcher ACC Syracuse has to get there gu Starling back and theyre going to have to win some games to get to the tournament um ACC isnt as strong as it has in past year so theyre going to have to string together some wins and uh we talked to Coach AR he mentioned NC State went from not in the tournament to final four so thats the template in the blueprint that uh a lot of coaches in ACC are saying for teams that arent doing as well NC State won five games in a row in Washington to win the title yeah and then go to the final four last year thats basketball it could change in a second thats why we love this game and its fun to watch orange trying to return to the tournament for the first time since 2021 Bosco Bullseye for bosow great atto after timeout play by buckell getting the screen for BOS to the corner their best scorer and threepoint shooter Bucknell had been one of its last 10 shots prior to the Bosco 3 Syracuse has made five of its last six shots 720 and rolling in the second half Bell had it deflected Movic gets it right back to him for the reload Movic the onehanded rebound Applause Moore movich two extra shots for his team wont go on the stat sheet but uh its BOS again John let go hes trying to bring this team back six points the last two possessions for him how about 19 points now for BOS and backto back threes I said in our pregame hes got a lot on his shoulders so good to see him kind of getting ready and uh to take this game over if he has to to try to get will his team to win playing with confidence at the moment John BOS shot clocks at five for Freeman the open man is Carlos angular rebound Bell got it Carlos Movic it give and go and a foul and then theres some pushing and shoving after the whistle a j and Movic and now Freeman comes in no no we dont need that and the officials are making sure to quell the situation freshman get a little too involved a felt like maybe maybe he got his teammate got Steed over I think masteris was just trying to get out of the way so a little bit of a misunderstanding good on everybody to kind of let cooler hairs Prevail marit with a nice finish I think he was just trying to walk back to the line I dont think he was trying to do anything following play is under review for possible technical fouls well you saw Ted Valentine come in and signify technical fouls when you to see who they are issued against in this situation Freemans got to kind of Let It Go certainly good that things did not escalate beyond that point John Henson very very good so again this is Movic with the shot and its pip aayi 23 taking exception mccre tried to draw the offensive foul hes the one whos on the court and then Freeman comes in and hes talking to a j and that situation did not develop luckily yeah its an intense game two teams two teams that are not playing as well as they want to if you think this is just a nonconference wrapup for the orange you are mistaken and Coach arrey told us as much we need this one today were headed towards conference play in Earnest coach ay said he said look we have our nonconference play and we have our conference play um our nonconference hasnt gone as well as we wanted but conference play can change and hes breaking the season up as like that you play well in conference you get to the postseason get JJ Starling back in the mix as well their leading score before he went to the bench with the left hand injury I I like what they have especially with movich and and cuff junor Off the Bench kind of starting to establish himself as rotational players you get your star player back I think Syracuse would be a force to reckon with their preseason 11 uh picked so not much expected so anything above that I I think Syracuse would take so our officials Ted Valentine Tommy morresy and Clarence Armstrong just trying to get on the same page as to who will be assessed the technical fouls that we saw were signified by Ted Valentine time as he came in probably going to get Freeman maybe with a with a push um maybe escalating a little bit um I dont see much else probably a ja too I guess thats what were being told in offsetting fashion okay Freeman a jaay the important thing here is that the situation did not escalate Beyond right when the officials came in to separate the two players you can understand the emotion the intensity now theyre on a big stage here they want to perform and they have John so far they have they theyve played fairly well up until this point fighting back some big shots technical foul on Blue 23 and white one well shoot one free throw and keep play okay so each team is going to get a technical free throw Tommy morrisy came over to further clarify to our broadcast position Court side at Jim baheim court and again Freeman and a ja technical fouls offsetting you wonder how the officials will handle things from this point forward John because things are a little tense things are a little tense A J has been taken out by coach Griffin Im Im assuming to calm things down as well as Freeman thats great for both coaches to kind of let cooler heads prevail and you know let their team know that this is an important part of the game technicals could hurt your team so so we have the free throw from Movic thatll be the only free throw because remember he did make the basket so this is just to complete the threepoint play all right so weve cleared that up my strobic at the free throw line for Syracuse little intermission you guys wanted to hear us talk here you are catch your breath myovich before today had only been to the line five times All Season hes getting significant minutes for Coach Applause arrey crossing the sixminute threshold in the second half on CW quick side Saturday game two Arizona Bowl to follow us Williamson weak side Movic got tangled up with MCC and mccre gets the foul for Bucknell just a impact that I dont think anyone expected from movich this game board and rebounding playing with energy if youre Syracuse the only way to to to get for buck M to get back in the game is three so you got to run them off the line with 5 minutes left up 12 points season high for musich today trying to add to it hes got eight averages 23 per game for the Freshman from Serbia at the free throw line playing some crucial minutes too there youre the first one youre coming back7 nine points Applause now orang is led by as many as 15 in this half after leading by 12 at halftime Bucknell cut the lead to six early portions of this second half that rolls out of bounds unfortunately right in front of Coach Griffin cuff junr wont get a lot of credit for that possession but his pressure on Edmonds the fourth made him lose the ball and effect messed up the time tbos coming off the screen for the threepoint play Carlos bringing it up hes got eight points four of eight from the floor three rebounds and nine assists for jquan Carlos his careerhigh and assists is outrageous 19 did that at hostar lampin lost the ball good effort diving for it couldnt come up with it buck finally double teaming lampin I dont know if its a little too late but we will see Williamson inside against lampin giving lampin a little taste of his own medicine stealing him nice left hook and a nice feed by BJC as well nice by DJ Le Hook was my goto I always love to see that that one fell for Williamson that doesnt fall for the orange at the other end and Williamson has it williamon avoided the travel Edmonds pass deflected by cuff out of bounds Edmond might have got saved on that because I didnt see the I didnt see anyone where the ball was going so that deflection might have uh saved Edmond on that drive coach Griffin might be thinking the same thing in his second year he was a standout Bucknell player played in two NCAA tournaments couple of patriot League titles while he was a player assisted and now the head coach and its Bosco from the corner we talked about Bucknell coming back and they cannot let Syracuse cannot let B nail shoot threes thats the only way to equalize this game and uh now this is becomes a crucial possession for Syracuse to get a good shot 22 points for bosow hes been in double digits 11 times this season lampin try to make the move put the shoulder down and got Williamson up in the air nice pump fake by Lin right there get him in the air draw the foul knows that theyre in the bonus Savvy play just past 400 on the Eastern Seaboard 6759 with lampin at the free throw line the Arizona Bowl to follow us on a big day of college basketball and football on the CW Tom wormy along with John Henson former North Carolina standout John Henson a two time defend uh Defensive Player of the Year in the ACC had a good run had a good run played in the finals of the ACC tournament 2011 and 12 eight years in the NBA predominantly with the Milwaukee Bucks Im used to this weather Tom I was I was prepared well this weather today was 50° in short sleeves right right right although there is a blanket of snow here in Sy New York on the campus were inside the Dome first meeting since November of 2019 between these programs buddy beheim scored 22 points in Syracuse beat Buck now 9746 rims out for Bosco lamin hustling to the corner to track it down I like how Buck Ms trying to get BOS all the shots he can take after making three threes this last couple minutes inside of three and a half minutes to go in the orange by 10 stolen away Edmonds just wrestled that one away from greenan Lo on the run up and under two strong he ends up in the front row hes behind the play at the moment and now coach ay signals to Carlos for the timeout 6959 Syracuse trying to win its sixth game of the season and go to six and one at home Applause Music Music go Music this is the last box I know were say Les we got yall C CW whats happening how you doing

boards buckell in the zone maybe try to affect the offensive acument of Eddie Applause lampin lamin got it hes the story of this game man he hes T been everything and more for syc Cruz he picked up a rebound and a bucket in the same Applause play Bosco has 22 points a season high for buck Nell 12point games guys some threes to follow off your Bucknell there goes one Applause DJ if youre Syracuse you get a good shot every possession you should win this game and thats got to be the goal stared with Carlos running the show and and niasar team gets it to the sets only negative for the orange so far might be the turnovers they got 20 today and had 21 in their last game last Saturday against Maryland was a season high and theyve now giving it back to Bucknell with 202 to go we are not done 7162 this feels like a possession where some must score for Bucknell I think they got to go three if they can get a good shot or a quick score to the basket Id imagine Boscos coming off some type of action theyve made 10 threes in the game and Boscos got six of them this is him 13 in blue couldnt get rid of Taylor defending spone spins and misses l in the position second and third effort somehow spone gets it back Bosco 3 ft behind the line Freeman the rebound that would have made it very interesting would have Syracuse fortunate for that Miss from bosow would have turned that into a two possession game third foul on bosow so two shots coming up for Carlos Applause so the orange came in this afternoon John they had lost four of their last five two in a row their last win was December 10th on this floor against Aly when they scored 112 points and one 10285 they had lost to Georgetown at home 7571 and their alone ACC game at Notre Dame they lost on the road in South Bend we havent discussed Carlos hes got 10 points nine assists three turnovers hes been a rock for them today Freeman also has a double double his fifth of the year its just good for them going in ACC play where theyre going to have to string together some wins speedone got it back has to send it back out beak against Freeman trying to hold his position they both hit the deck bjx in discomfort and the fouls on Freeman know that was good defense by Freeman not letting him shoot the three I dont know if I would have called that but you know what its why Im not a ref guys so tough look tough its tough bang bang play right there the ref had to make a call theres too much contact both players fail Clarence Armstrong was right on top of the call to send bjx to the free throw line both teams double bonus 10 three on the game Applause clock s only hit one three the second half whichit six in the first Williamson got it back for a moment and then it goes to Carlos and then spon fouls him almost immediately they were that close to getting the Miss off the free throw from BC once again though credit to Bucknell I mean theyve played some highlevel teams and talent you know 10point game against an ACC power five opponent will B for them B well for them in uh the Patrick League Play theyre going to be just fine Carlos to the free throw line the orange 12 of 19 from the strike this season as a team 70 in from the free throw line as that one rolls off for Applause Carlos trying to make it an 11point game with 595 seconds to go in regulation I got OT is familiar territory for Bucknell we told you theyve had four overtime games they need a surge and they need it quickly looks like theyre going to run this screen for BOS the top of the key Edmond got tied up and taken away cuff and then Williamson fouls him grabs the rib cage and thats the fourth on Williamson time to take a look at todays player of the game brought to you by Progressive Insurance save when you bundle Auto home and motorcycle insurance visit progressivecom Eddie lkin visiting the box score early and often 18 points 11 boards five offensive boards hes been a beast down there hes the reason why the Syracuse team is up 11 points they have had no answers for Eddie lampin down there looking like the lampin at TCU today spent three years in that program one in Colorado first year playing for the orange wearing number 44 which he also wore in Colorado and hes got his third double double of the Season as well Freeman has one also for the orange final 44 seconds Williamson so it appears that the orangs are on their way to Victory inside the Dome theyll improve to six and six six and one at home on Jim beheim Court about a 10second difference between game and shot for Carlos Taylor weak side Bosco and lampin out of bounds to Bucknell and can still fighting down there I love it next game for the orange New Years Eve right here against Wake Forest the only meeting of the Season thatll be at 200 orange lost at wake in early February last season 9970 Williamson one final shot Go Get It Go Get It give Carlos pulls it in and Syracuse will win it 7563 after leading by 12 at halftime they get the victory for Coach arrey nice win by Syracuse
