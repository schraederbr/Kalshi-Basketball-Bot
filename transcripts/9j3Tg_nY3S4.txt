seems like it may as well have been 3 years ago the way things can evolve in a basketball season both teams are different frankly both teams are better and nobody in the country is playing better than North Carolina is right now pit controls the tip all freshman back court Jaylen low with the ball and Bob Carrington and they are both talented confident and have really grown into the role as Jeff C told us they got a lot thrown at them as true freshman in the back court early this year the jumper won go down for Blake Hinson here come the heels Harrison Ingram starting out on Blake Hinson that is strength on strength and Ingram provides a a great Edge to this team one of the best rebounders in the country led the ACC in ACC play in rebounding at 11 you expect Carolina to try to go inside to Bott as much as they can early absolutely got a switch Now Blake Henson on Bott and they are going at it but an Aaron pass by Ingram turns it over to the Panthers well hson just had B wrapped up his arms completely around him and that pass just a little bit too strong thats a tough angle to break contact and be able to go get it the starting five for pit with Lo and Carrington talked about them Hinson as well Zack Austin and then Federico federo who will split time at the five spot with guo Diaz Graham as the Panthers strike first oh bu Carrington so good in that middle pick and roll and theres Carolina going inside Hinson had his arm wrapped around Ingram on that he literally got turned around they were backto back with one another and just a terrific rebound by Zack Austin whos a good Defender energy guy passes up the three lost it on the way up shot clock did not reset Low misses the jumper and kdo was grabbing and pulling the jersey of Austin and he got caught with his hand in the cookie jar Ill take a look right here at bub Carrington gets the ball back just that middle screen roll then twists it and he just puts Cormac Ryan on his back very good in the midrange and hes very good at changing speeds he can snake those pick and rolls he is a really good guard hent driving on Bott and he lost it numbers for the heels Kad with the L well you make a mistake and Carolina turns it into a basket in no time the transition ability of this team has improved from the middle of the season to now where they are really running and they ran like crazy against Florida State yesterday and Jeff cable who played at Duke coached at Duke an assistant coach for many years he said this Carolina team in terms of their transitional transition ability reminds him of vintage Carolina teams and he will be yelling at his guys to get back bacock Powers it up and in well speaking of transition Armando Bott ran down the middle of the floor and established low post position you give him an angle and play him on the high side hes going to spin off to the Baseline thats exactly what he did against Federico Federico and Hubert Davis wanted to establish Armando Bott early get his big guy going and hes got to be very pleased with that bot playing in his 165th game of course a fifth year player second Team all ACC this year also a member of the ACC all defensive team and a significant Spike this year in his free throw shooting fed Rico good patience and he lays it in didnt call a walk there because he didnt have possession he was bobbling the ball so that allowed him those extra steps Kau tipped out by Ingram how often do you see Carolina do that all the time they do it on free throws and you have to be alert if they cant grab it theyre going to tip it back and someone in white is most likely to get it Ingram the transfer from Stanford has had a great year for Carolina kcks it to Cormac Ryan deep one oh boy he is now 10 of his last 13 from three I think the other nine just swished in that one anything but but they all count the newest heel hit the heel of the rim and it went in well hes playing with so much confidence low the pull up little strong rebound Ryan here they come again cormack Ryan had that ball in his hands for no time after he grabbed that rebound and Carolina was out running Davis looking into Bott and a foul on feder Rico and thats going to be his second in the early going the activity of Armando Bott has been impressive but after this initial strip Carolina out and running and thats one of the great things about Harrison Ingram he can operate basically as a small forward when he grabs a rebound he can rip it and run himself without having to outlet it to a guard that makes Carolina that much faster so Jay feder Rico on the bench with two guo Diaz Graham in how does has Chang things defensively for pit it means that pit is going to have to double team in the post because Diaz Graham is not as strong physically as feder Rico feder Rico can go oneonone in the post with Armando bacok its still Advantage bacock because hes so good but Diaz Graham needs help but Diaz Graham can do that he can stretch the floor try to pull Bott away from the bucket and knock down a three Ingram to Ryan and thats partially blocked by Austin it was all the way blocked you got to give a shot around him for Jaylen low so quick such a great handle Diaz gram open again how about that checks into the game and he knocks down two threes in about 30 seconds just the simple pick and pop play and Armando Bott in drop coverage that means hes covering far below the ball and worried more about a roll and containing the ball Ingram no Diaz Graham the rebound so with Diaz Graham coming in and hitting threes that can stretch out this Carolina defense and open up the middle and now Bops got to get on him up at the threepoint line low gets all the way to the bucket and part of that it looked like Bott didnt want to go get low he was worried about Diaz Graham it was all of that he had to worry about Diaz Graham so he cant just park in the lane like he could with Federico feder Rico in the game 80 run pit RJ Davis puts it on the deck good pass Ryan open on the wing airball excellent block out by Blake Hinson on Armando Bott low Austin what a start for the Panthers this is the way Pittsburgh plays they want to spread you out in knock down threes they make over nine per game and they can go for more than that if they get hot and thats without Blake Hinson knocking any down yet they take and make more than any team in the ACC has this year Davis snow and Austin again just a terrific energy guy good rebounder back to low around the screen and Diaz Graham is called for the Applause foul feder Rico feder Rico getting into early foul trouble that brings the J Mo Diaz Graham into the game the penetration kicking it back out to the big guy who knocks down a three then a little pick and pop action Arondo Bott has to recover but just not in Music time one wins seven Road wins including at Duke at Virginia one bad loss to Missouri they started one and five 12 and3 C not that that is something thats looked at but theyre playing very well right now the win of wake last night moved their net from 45 to 40 you use the phrase a win tonight would solidify their case for an NCAA bir I think theyre a tournament team but obviously our opinions dont count its just the committee members voting individually but this is a tournament team no question in my mind Seth Trimble into the game for Carolina terrific last night or yesterday afternoon against Florida State 12 points five rebounds big poot following up the Miss Jaylen wither has checked in as well number 24 for the heels Ryan forces it up cant get it to go Diaz Graham the rebound on a contact on that shot but smart of Seth Trimble to throw the ball inside get it back and then throw it in again so bacock could repost ishma Leed in the game for the first time for pit coming off the bench the second half of the Year again just a monster game against wake yesterday 30 points and eight rebounds hon looking to go oneonone against Ryan Ryan stands him up and wins the battle the stayed in front make him take that tough two over here RJ Davis yet to score in this game Blake Hinson yet to score in this game Pittsburgh doing some switching on RJ Davis to make sure theyre attached and theres coverage that step back is so hard to deal with off the back of the iron its pit ball Diaz grah kicks it back to low and now theyll set up B low an excellent ball Hammer lefthanded goes to that left hand just couldnt complete it barington gets back quickly to get in front of Davis not the easiest thing in the world to do Bott cant get the Applause reverse in this four game winning streak of pit that we were talking about last three regular season games and then yesterday here they are averaging 85 points per game and winning by an average margin of 15 a game as the tough Runner goes for above carington such a creative finisher around the basket low and Carrington gives pit two point guards on the floor at all times similar to when Davis and Kau are out there for North Carolina Carrington a freshman from Baltimore and a member of the ACC all rookie team Jaylen Withers with a bucket for Carolina snapping a streak of eight consecutive missed field goals hes got 15 rebounds in his last two games against Duke and Florida State he is really starting to be a big contributor Off the Bench for North Carolina and in not a ton of minutes too hes kind of a 12 to 14 minute guy off the bench for them and he was a starter at Louisville hit 43s last year leg get a good look cant knock it down and theres a rebound for Applause Withers boy Davis has about six different gears doesnt he and theyre all fast the Stop and Go game is tremendous Withers and that elbow got up in the face of Hinson Hinson is saying he got me but I think the foul is on him they may have a look well see as they go to break pit doing a lot of things well Jay in the early going well Pittsburgh has pushed the pace when theyve been on the defensive boards and bu Carrington Just a freshman he doesnt play like it thats a heck of a Music finish on ESPN 2 the call was an offensive foul on Jaylen Withers so 24 and white with the ball and as he swings the arms the call was an offensive foul they went to the monitor to see if there was anything beyond that worth upgrading it to a flagrant one and the verdict was no so pit ball with an early sevenpoint lead here in Washington really good match up between ish leet and Seth Trimble just switched out now that puts Jaylen Washington on him he can drive him to to the right Washington has come in for Bott Le it pulls up cant hit it and it belongs to the Applause heels Washington can shoot that three hes eight for 15 from Beyond The Arc so you got two big guys who can really shoot the ball from outside on the floor right now Washington can pull the trigger on a three he doesnt shoot many of them more of a face up big guy down in the low post rather than a guy thats going to go into contact but very skilled did you ever think nine minutes into the game neither RJ Davis nor Blake Hinson would have scored somehow I think thatll be remedy yes the Knight is Young Davis with Carrington on him the screen by Washington Baseline Trimble off to Washington who Banks it home well he has become a much better finisher in the lane and anytime Seth Trimble catches the ball he should drive it such a powerful driver even though hes not a perimeter shooter he can get by people when he jumps off two feet forget it how about that dunky had in yesterdays game Diaz Graham misses it Hinson Taps it out but Davis has it Davis all the way it will go that is just speed personified and when you try to tip the ball out against Carolina one of the negatives of Carol Ina can take it the other way and start their transition quick 40 run heels back within three Midway through the first half Carolinas switching right now one through five Harrington for three yes he is a player leads pit and assists hes second in points per game threes second in rebounding how about excellent guard rebound how about the only freshman in the nation averaging 13 1 12 points five rebounds and four assist game this year just got a complete game and hes really good defensively stays in front of RJ Davis 64 got good length off Washington out of bounds back to pit after pit TI back that rebound just trying to get it to a teammate that started the break and RJ Davis goes between Defenders and puts it off the glass just beautifully done by maybe the best two guard in the country nobodys played better this year than RJ Davis has for North Carolina do you know at the beginning of this year he was 48th on Carolinas alltime scoring list hes ninth now he passed 39 guys this year and he may pass a couple tonight Herrington fouled on the try well theyre defense those 39 guys didnt get to play this year no they didnt yeah they didnt contribute much at all I dont know why Hubert has some on scholarship RJ Davis uh may hit 2000 points tonight came into the game with 1975 uh Davis is ninth all time and he is seven points behind Larry Miller so he could pass him for eighth tonight could wind up realistically depending on how deep they go in postseason play could wind up Fifth all time on the Carolina scoring amazing Applause amazing Washington out Davis out Bott in Ryan in and to think that the back court that RJ Davis played in the last three years Caleb love and RJ Davis is both players of the Year this year in different league in a major major major conferen yeah pretty good meanwhile pit extends the lead to Applause eight the four seed in this tournament thats the highest theyve been since coming into the ACC each of these teams is just playing for the second time in as many nights each earned the double buy so no Davis could do and Trimble out there on the perimeter along with Ryan Trimble will take a three and hit it for Seth Trimble he doesnt take a ton of them but hes now 10 for 25 and by my man thats 40 by anybodys man that makes Seth tremble now the fourth Tarheel in double figure threes on the season they only have three all this time with Ryan Davis and Ingram legot good job by kdo forcing legot to kick it out five on the shot clock Carrington into a cutting Diaz Graham who missed it a terrific cut and what a find by bub Carrington Trimble was kind of stumbling backwards just threw it back out into the perimeter Trimble is stronger than jayen low if he winds up getting it he should drive that matchup Ingram Baseline on Hinson and Diaz Graham gets nabbed for the foul number two on guo Diaz Graham Carolina down five but a big three recently Jay to get him closer well Pittsburgh packing the paint because theyre not as worried about SE Seth Trimble knocking down a three but he knocks down his 10th three of the Year shooting about 37 from by against Duke one team NC State likes to play Fast Virginia not so much so where to all of these teams stand well if you ask Joe lonardi Virginia is one of the last four in does that mean they need this one tonight to lock it up and you can see pit one of the first four outs according to Joey brackets right now and obviously even if theyre not in now a win tonight over Carolina would be monstrous for them as youve said its not just about that its about you know were close enough to the finish line here in this tournament its about a trophy and a banner and memories and Legacy and all all of that as well but pit is playing for a lot here tonight one thing I know you win the ACC tournament Championship you dont have to worry about any of this Applause stuff slice cut screen for the screener action for pit good pressure on the ball by Seth Trimble he is such a good Defender Federico federo back in hes got two fouls as does GU mod Diaz Graham Soft Touch by bub carrying he just uses that ball screen so well fed Rico was rolling to the basket he had the lob but because he just didnt blast off that and used a change of speed it was really effective too tries a three cant hit it trembl hit one already tonight Carolina needs to pick up the pace offensively even when theyre in the half half court and maybe thats why RJ Davis is coming back in maybe Huberts seeing the same thing youre seeing and theyre not playing fast enough R ran their offense with great Pace in the half court on those possessions against Florida State now they had so much in transition they were scoring Every Which Way Pitts done a good job of taking away transition same play they just ran and the Calls going against feder Rico and thats going to be number three on him and Jeff Cables got to think about what he wants Diaz Graham stood up and C said no no no no sit back down and William jeffris a 67 red shirt Jor from Erie Pennsylvania is coming into the game as pit gets quite a bit smaller and they go deeper than they typically go well jeffris is a good Defender but hes giving up some size to Armando bot jeffris on the season averaging about 11 minutes per game and a quick bucket for RJ Davis and a howl on wed to boot just ran a little wide pin down for RJ Davis he can come off it to the ball he can curl it and the defender is going to be trailing he curled it a bit went up got hit by legot and still had the presence to take that cona a contact and knock the shot down now you got a great free throw shooter going for a threepoint play dont say Laughter it he couldnt hear me fourpoint lead for pit 620 to go here in the first half of the first semifinal tonight poor M Ryan is called for the foul hes got two hands on the ball handle hes been doing a good job of staying in front and getting over that screen Zack Austin returns now for the Panthers leit will sit so they get a little bit bigger not at the five spot but at one of the other spots on the floor Harrison Ingram still on Blake Hinson thats a really good matchup between a great scorer and Ingram who does a good job defensively and physically theyre like the same size both really strong same height both 6 seven hes not going to pully Ingram Ingram forced him into a tough turnaround the foul is on the floor no basket just had both hands on him and went you have to get that armar off of the offensive player when he faces up but once you get two hands on the ball handler like like that its all over its part of what makes Hinson so dangerous he can post and Bully his way to the basket sometimes hes also made more threes than anybody in the ACC this season got a switch low sizing up bot step back three short good job by bot to stay in front how about this pass kdo ahead to Bott Carolina back within two reward the big guy Carolina just wears you down Carolina fans getting into it three wont go for Carrington Here Comes kadoo oh what a block by Zack Austin highlight real Stu with the def defensive end for Austin the Sailing In from behind the play and wipes this one away looked like Kad was trying to go left hand off the backboard and instead its in row two red Shir Jr a transfer from High Point Carolina can Tire Take the Lead the pass Bott swings it to kadoo extra pass to Ryan steps in Ingram ties the game well that was all made by the ball movement and then the great shot F by cor mat Ryan can pit weather the storm here after this run by the heels this tarel defense is pretty Harrington with a bayot on him tough two and it goes that is not an easy shot Jay hes got half of their points and Armando Bott is called for the foul getting a little too physical trying to post on Jeffers Jeffers did a good job getting down early and fighting him and Armando bot trying to get around in front once you do that swim move Jeff cable just trying to buy some minutes with Federico Federico on the bench with three fouls and guo Diaz Graham on the bench with two fouls so hes got Jefferson there playing against Bott at the five spot at the switch now Davis is on Hinson Hinson spins right into bot too strong off the glass and which way is it going its going on pit it looks like a great job by Armando Bott to come over from the weak side to challenge Blake Hinson after he got past RJ Davis on the switch now this is why Armando Bott is on the ACC all defensive team just waited behind walled up and Im not sure who Jeff hit he looked like he hit his own man 17 foul so one and one for Elliot fidau who was so good in the win of her Florida yesterday uh led the team in floor burns and Diving on the floor and having to change leggings and and bloody knees and all of that but distributed the ball pushed the break just did so many good things for Carolina I thought Elliot Kau changed the tener of the game where he Dove on that loose ball when Florida state was just bending over at the waist and he had a dozen floorb burs in that game to go along with the six assists made them both well you didnt say anything about his free throw percentage thats why Jay bis with some rition history here on live National TV Arrington into traffic got 13 already tonight or is he having to work hard boy cor brryan did a great job getting around in front jeffris rebound Ingram who has had 10 or more rebounds in seven of his last eight games and another pit foul Bo its so hard to keep RJ Davis out of the Applause lane tied at 26 late of the first half here in semifinal number one at the basketball is brought to you by principal let our expertise round out yours tied here at 26 between pit and Carolina yesterday pit with a big big win over awake and ish leged a huge game Off the Bench with 30 points eight rebounds five steals first 355 game of the ACC tournament since Christian lner 32 years ago and special for many reasons Jess why he was able to have that game yesterday yes Dan the best moment for ish definitely came post game when he got to celebrate with his father Dietrich for the first time since wearing the pit uniform Dietrich suffered a massive Str broke wild behind the wheel driving is to basketball practice his freshman year of high school he spent the next 6 months in the hospital where he had three brain surgeries and was diagnosed with paralysis and severe expressive Aphasia coach cable said that he saw U uh issues faced when he got photos of the two together last night and he got really emotional because he knows how much his dad means to him and they even met over zoom while he was being recruited ish has a tattoo on his bicep that says a for D all for Di because he says everything I do is in dedication to him J thank you touching heartwarming stuff and so amazing that ish legett is able to have his dad in the building here with him this week yeah really beautiful and Jeff cable told us before the game that he had noticed that ish legot had a camera earlier this year he says do you like to take pictures and he says yeah Im doing that now but this is my Dads camera and then he had his dads camera with him yesterday the pit social media crew was there to document all that but just a beautiful story Diaz Graham has returned playing with two low driving Baseline on kdo little arm bar to create some space he lays it in tie the game really well defended early by North Carolina but Pittsburgh just wouldnt be denied on that reversal pass and that was a strong drive by Jaylen low he is a really good young player oh just an Aaron pass by Kau picked off by Diaz Graham well RJ Davis fell down he shouldnt have thrown it at all he has Grahams hit two threes Harringtons Applause open and Bott watches it go out of bounds and it will be Pittsburgh Applause basketball and now they change the call and give it to Carolina Jeff cable saying what gives I called it but I didnt see it Applause Jeff cable playing a Duke in the early or the mid90s uh Hubert Davis playing at Carolina late 80s and early 90s Jeff Cables first year at Duke was 9394 when Duke went to the final four he was back court mates with Grant Hill Ryan the kick and kdo called for a travel sixth Carolina turnover with Pittsburgh tied in this game with two and a half to go in the first half Blake Henson has not yet scored unbelievable averaging 19 a game give credit to Harrison Ingram there has been some switching but Ingrams done a great job on it Carrington has picked up the slack and then some cant finish this one but it stays with the Applause Panthers Pittsburgh needs to Poss position Hinson opposite some screen roll action that would open up the roll because you cant really leave Blake Hinson hon 0 for three from the floor in this one Carrington what a night he is having that is now 16 for the Freshman buob Carrington hes had some big scoring nights but hes not only got to carry the scoring load now hes got to guard RJ Davis the double on little shovel pass Kau missed it another rebound for Diaz Graham hes done a really nice job on the glass in addition to knocking down a couple threes early news fifth rebound of the night dri cable trying to piece it together with the five spot with a foul trouble an open Middle with Armando Bott having to get out and guard Diaz gr Leed missed the reverse Diaz Graham got a hand on it but its out of bounds to Carolina Applause anytime bu K he got a little screen from Blake Hinson to give him some separation when he went around that handoff and he came off that handoff action ready to fire but that separation from that initial screen from Henson is what made the play Trimble into bacot going right into the chest of Diaz Graham once he catches it there he gets a little low cross screen so hes catching it on the move and that means Diaz Graham is on the move when he negotiates that screen hes just not strong enough to keep Armando Bott from getting to the rim and also mindful of playing with a couple of fouls as well low the crossover Bs on him at the moment the scoop up and in hes a lefty just used that left hand to get it up on the backboard quicker than bacock could block him final minute of the first half hit has led most of the way Ingram knocks it down to TI it so worried about RJ Davis when you help off or overh help Ingram is positioned well to take that three boy what a first half a spot in the ACC Championship Game on the line Diaz Graham spins and lays it in over bacock a right hand drive and then spins off the pressure and finishes with the left that is a skilled sevenfooter Yuber Davis hollers out of play signals to RJ Davis they can milk the final few seconds D yeah Hinson on him right now two seconds and he missed the driving layup meaning pit will take a lead into halftime continue to make Carrington take tough shots and get him out of his rhythm it didnt feel like little bursts here and there it felt like okay Carolinas playing Carolina basketball ripping down a rebound running going laying it in but there wasnt a whole lot of that Jay in the first half well give pit credit their transition defense was excellent after the initial surge of North Carolina pit really got back and turned North Carolina into more of a half court team Carolina ball to start the second half and you have to think the Carolina wants to go after feder Rico feder Rico to start whos playing with three the rebound down to Hinson and here comes pit led by jayen low hon got the switch hes got Kau on him and he is calling for the ball but he didnt get it now he gets it Baseline jumper too strong not sure he should have taken that just bully Elliot Kau to the rim RJ Davis had to work hard two for six they really made like difficult on him in the first half nothing easy for him kadoo boy is he good at up on the glass saw he does such a good job with that little crossover going slow to fast and even though he is not a threat to knock down a perimeter shot he can still get to the paint and get to the rim garrington defended by Ryan now Hinson a challenge three around and out and Jeff Pap put his hands on his head he knew that Hinson had that one thats a shot he normally makes Ryan a quick release he misses the three these long shots have not been rebounded quite as well by North Carolina still think they need to attack inside first fto Rico playing with three fouls not an outside shooter much different than when Diaz Graham is in the game and the big Knight continues for Carrington anytime he gets around a screen he is coming off firing but his pace is just so good in screening Ingram the shot fake and the drive got challenged couldnt finish it good help there by feder Rico really good vertical contest by feder Rico feder Rico Ingram tried to finish that with the left hand and had to hold it out to avoid the shot block hit was able to get through about the last 7 Minutes of the half without feder Rico after he picked up his third they got some minutes from William J and then Diaz Graham T in as well and they kind of surviv that situation but again if he were to pick up a quick one here in the second hed go right back to the bench well that was so well defended by cormack Ryan that little elbow action low up top tipped up no good and Carolinas running je cable wants to know that why that wasnt a foul felt he got pushed in the Applause air this is Harrison Ingram the back down when hes got a matchup Advantage P do chips it to Bott who spins and hits to tie the game anytime Bott is going to drive doesnt matter which side he loves to spin back toward the Baseline you have to take away that initial drive but that opens up that spin hes really good at getting an angle none of these Carolina players as Jess Sims talked about off the top of the show has ever won an ACC tournament title the last time they won it was long before Bott got here it was 2016 in this building and there is a lot of motivation on the Carolina side to say hey we know we got some bigger things coming big things coming in the NCAA tournament maybe a one seed but they want to win a championship here this week Pittsburgh running middle action and for the second time in a row through that lob up to Federico Federico when he couldnt grab it bring it down he just passed it off the low who got that foul just a nice play by feder Rico when he couldnt get it on the initial initial pass Jaylen low the freshman from Missouri City Texas is at the line Jeff cable talking to us about a nerve issue that low had in his knee at the beginning of the year iced his knee for too long or maybe too cold and created a nerve problem and it really took him a couple of months to get totally healthy thats why he started the year on the bench then Midway through the year ish leged came up with a bit of a sore shoulder and Jeff cable swapped him leot went to the bench and was incredibly productive coming off the bench Sixth Man of the Year in the conference low went into the starting lineup and Jay had really benefited the team as a whole RJ Davis Carolina leads RJ Davis set a little low cross screen for Armando Bott usually hed get a screen from there but when pit came with the double that left Davis open on the opposite side that was really smart by Rond bot to dribble out of that double where he could pass opposite low draws a crowd and kicks to Zach Austin who misses the three and Carolinas got it Ryan keeps the dribble alive tip no good by bot and now Hinson comes up with it and pits got it it has numbers big caught behind the play Hinson still scoreless in this game as it belongs to the Panthers onepoint lead Tar Heels early in the second Music half ways North Carolina frees up RJ Davis is to use him as a screener you see him on the right side of the floor hes going to go set a low cross screen for arando Bott little on big and usually hed get a down screen from Harrison Ingram but he pops out because of the double team hes wide open on the opposite side of the floor that was a really good job by Armando Bott of dribbling out of that double team so he could make that crosscourt pass really well well done Player of the Year in the ACC the leading scorer in the ACC and how about just the fifth guy in the last 50 Seasons from Carolina to lead the ACC in scoring and boy you put that starting five on the floor Ill take them you can have the field you put anybody with Michael Jordan works out pretty well that is an amazing would you an amazing f it is I mean the history of that program obviously incredible and RJ Davis uh getting himself into some pretty pretty good company jayen low with a three pit back on top lead change number six tonight low set a back pick and then popped out to the threepoint line and all the action went with the cutter Davis no low the rebound Ive been impressed with the way Pittsburgh has run off of Misses again a team that has won four in a row the four seed in this league playing with a lot of confidence stolen by kdo great defense by r b what a pass how about that pass to RJ Davis and one they give credit to Armando Bott hes making plays on both ends of the floor stopping that drive by Ish leget then Kad jumps in front thats just excellent defense and a great steal by Kad but this is a Next Level pass pretty good grab by RJ Davis as well two personal fouls RJ Davis the foul on Carrington Davis at the line now Carolina is a high dap team yes they dap all the time that shows a close group dapping is a is a good thing you ought to try it sometime Davis knocks it down by the way he has officially passed Larry Miller into eighth place now on the Carolina scoring l so he has passed 40 guys this year Larry Miller was a great player Lefty could really shoot him Diaz Graham into at the five spot for pit out of the last timeout good minutes at a couple of Threes in the first half same action but better defended by North Carolina low the Miss and away from the ball its a foul on Carolina and judging by the look on cormack Ryans face its on him yeah he just gave a little shove too Diaz Applause Graham Applause a Subway push the little discard of Diaz Graham hosage trimbles in oh what a steal Bott will finish what a play and thats why hes on the all defensive team in the Atlantic Coast Conference its not just block shots and we got as Roy Williams looks on a brief delay some of the Carolina fans sitting to our right were so excited about that there was beer spillage a beer spillage yes what a great steal by Armando Bott his defense has been a big factor in North Carolina jumping out to this lead bill raftery would be beside himself with beer spillage to our right a tragedy obviously a ton of Carolina folks one of the cool things about this Tournament being in Washington for the four teams that are still here none of them are that far away uh uba is only about 2 and 12 hours away and then Chapel Hill Raleigh in Pittsburgh all about four 4 and 12 hours away as you see botts place on the all defensive team well see the defensive player of the year and the runner up and they both wa for Virginia in the second game tonight were proud really getting on the The Spectator the spilled that beer thats an unacceptable turnover thats a flagrant to is what that is so and the league office will have to take a look at that well Harrison Ingram has done a really nice job on Blake Hinson he just hasnt been able to free himself up theyre just not leaving him hes trying and it feels like Hinson wants to shoot every time he can touch it just to break the ice and get himself going hes just pressing Bott fouled by Diaz Graham thatll be number three on him Bott not only had a great rim run he got great position down in that restricted area he just buried Diaz Graham right under the basket he just ran down the middle of the floor and got great position and locked Diaz Graham right on his hip had no choice but to foul him or give up the bucket and as Ive heard you say many times you get deep enough position you dont even have to make a post move you just go up and try to score thats what really what you tell post guys is post so deep that you dont have to make a post move Applause fourpoint lead Carolina over pit coming up next the postgame show nothing but net on the ACC Network telling you everything that you need to know from the two semifinals tonight getting you all charged up for the championship game that we will have at 830 eastern time tomorrow night on ESPN ran no Harrington wraps up the rebound well Pittsburgh has some outstanding rebounding guards is leget and Bub Carrington those guys both average over five rebounds per game and one of the first things Shubert Davis has said to us W yeah I mean just way too obvious didnt need it and got called for it and Jeff cable wants to settle his freshman guard down whos been so outstanding tonight and call a timeout and try to reverse the momentum here in this game yeah this is a this is a calm down timeout not just for Carrington but for Blake Hinson as well Carolina now leading by four were here in Washington of the ACC tournament but how about Nashville the SEC tournament Tennessee got beat by 17 by Mississippi State doors open for a one seat for Carolina and right now Texas AM is leading Kentucky last I saw I think AM was one of the first four out I want to say right now last four in forgive me my mistake Jay we spoke too soon last four in for Texas AM so that is obviously a game with bubble ramification so that could impact pit but boy all around the country just tremendous action going on here in champ week as RJ Davis extends the lead Carolina keeps getting a piece of the paint they are attacking the paint thats going to show up at the free throw line low misses the layup that was a strong side too hes a Applause lefty 80 run right now for the heels and Ryan over the back just picked up his third Carolina f third foul and thats going to send him to the bench as Ingram is in so Washington Withers and Ingram a bigger lineup Ingram in effect playing the three right now Blake Hinson has jayen Withers on him at the moment Hinson 0 for seven scoreless in the Applause game not much going on right now on this possession for the Panthers low trying to take matters into his own hands and he does low called for a screen from his back Fort mate Carrington a little guard on guard pick and roll action but a bucket at the other end how did Withers catch that ball he not only made a great catch in traffic off that RJ Davis bullet but was able to get it to Jaylen Washington that was beautiful trim slows down low Carrington and low have combined for 31 of pitch 44 points two freshman guards big load to carry the three wow yes what a night he is having and hes having to create it largely on his own this is just a freshman Jay not only have they not gotten a single point from Blake Hinson they havent gotten a single point from ish legett either who scored 30 against wake yesterday yeah those two combined for 5050 boy low might have gotten away with one right there and then Washington might have gotten away with one so its all even and here comes Applause pit hent back to low at the switch needs to take RJ Davis down the post now Trimble switches off on thats a good match up for North Carolina vinsent goes to the corner low pulls up from 17 and left it short crimble can bring it up on his own hes essentially a point guard out there into Washington who lays it in good find by Trimble Carolina starting to wear out Applause Pittsburgh barington using the screen feder Rico too strong Washington the rebound Ingram lost it and he and the ball goes sailing out of bounds Hubert Davis not particularly happy with that he wants his team to push it but not have his hybrid fourman dribbling through that much traffic what a great pass and catch and beautiful delivery by Jaylen Withers getting it inside to Jaylen Washington couple easy buckets for Carolina but Pittsburgh is working really hard because of Carolinas defense to get difficult baskets and theyre making a mostly bub Carrington but theyre having to work extremely hard to get difficult shots credit Carolinas defense for that Carrington and looh combined for 34 Hinson and Le have yet to score two guys who between them average better than 31 points per game this is Hinson step back and it goes and he breaks the ice with 10 and a half to go here in the second half and that was hardly poorly defended by jayen Withers made him take a tough shot fading away off the glass with really good offense and Hinson grimacing saw him reach down and kind of grab the outside of his left thigh have to keep an eye on that Trimble drives and a whistle and a foul going against pit like we got low yeah Blake Hinson just ripping through thought he might do that step back goes right through contact from two Carolina players Seth Trimble reached in there as well he really had to protect that ball almost like a running back before going up for that shot Trimble had a good one against pit in their regular season meeting on January the 2nd 10 points6 rebounds in 23 minutes and then was even better I thought against Florida State yesterday 12 points five rebounds two assists and 18 very powerful minutes off the bench and that was right after a 10point outing at Duke where he went five of nine from the field Seth Trimble has been giving Hubert Davis great minutes off the bench and while hes scoring his defense has been even more impactful trimbles now on bub Applause Kon hit was up two at the half Carolina up by five right now just past the Midway point of the second half winner to go to the championship game tomorrow shot clock at three Harrington had to adjust in midair and down with a rebound Ingram give Armando bot great credit for affecting that shot a touch for Bok Applause Music Applause double Davis calls a play Spinning into the paint and hits what a tough shot he called for that screen from Trimble because he wanted to go after low he knew hed get a switch and got the tough midrange jumper but he makes tough look easy doesnt he 16 now on the night for RJ Davis 10 in the second half got the switch low the crossover and it goes took a little bump from Bott and still finished it those are such difficult finishes Ingram lost the handle Leed and pits Miss three or four layups that normally obviously they make in this fivepoint game Armando Bott has been switching out on guards hes got bub Carrington here trying to stay in front but he knows he can put late pressure and that late pressure caused Carrington to have to adjust that shot and he missed it and then RJ Davis gets the switch that he wants and goes after it Yuber Davis just took RJ Davis out the under eight timeout not that far away get him a little breather here without missing a whole lot of game Applause time Trimble into to B the double the kick Ryan what a rebound attempt there by Trimble got way up in the air and it stays with Carolina Trimble Out jumped the ball Music unbelievable hes another one of these guys where youd say I mean hes a really good basketball player but boy does he look like he could be a halfback or something I mean just his power and his his strength his ability he could be a high jumper he doesnt need to fosberry flop just jump over the thing younger brother of JP too who was an excellent twofooted jumper Applause himself for M Ryan so hot the last couple of games cold tonight just one for nine B spins and hits and its back to seven his Mobility looks great hes moving his feet not only on offense but especially on defense is so ACC Le it got it and a foul bacock got a piece of his arm that is a big bucket going into the under eight timeout Leed will be at the free throw line as well would do we come back as pit tries to stay in it and pull off an UPS the three seed Virginia DJ Burns and Company about to play their fourth game in as many nights and as Burns told the assembled media after the game last night he said were not done yet we dont plan on going home just yet in all likelihood theyve got to win the tournament to go to the NCAA tournament they will play Virginia tonight the two teams split their two regular season matchups Pittsburgh is hanging in there and North Carolina in this second half nine of 14 from twopoint range now theyre just one of six from three but I think you expect Carolina to keep p in the ball inside to Armando Applause bot hell come out to set a ball screen RJ Davis still on the bench right now for Carolina the drive wont go and I think they got Hinson for a hole well Bott was right there for that rebound grabbed it with his right hand cuz his left arm was being grabbed just the first on Hinson once Kad drives that can open open up the offensive glass and baa you see the grab right there still grabbed it onehanded Davis back in for the heels kados Applause sits and here is Davis floater no tip no follow yes vott sticking with it he is just Relentless that wide pin down that means that bacock can just roll to the basket hes there for the off class should RJ Davis Miss seven minutes to go sixpoint game Hinson way short and it belongs to the heels great defense by Harrison Ingram he was attached to Blake Hinson and did not leave him it doesnt feel like any of hinsons threepoint attempts have been like clean comfortable catch and shoot plays and credit to Ingram on that all High degree of difficulty for Blake Hinson tonight now the switch low on Davis Ingram for three another rebound for bacock Davis for three and Carrington Soares for the rebound looks ahead to Hinson count it and one what a pass by Bob Carrington carington mid bending over at the waist he is tired but he has worked really hard in this game Jay I dont think Bob Carrington has come out of this game tonight he is listed at 34 minutes theres 614 to go you talked about the heavy load that he has to carry tonight for this team well how could Jeff capable afford to take him out what a fantastic onehanded diagonal pass to Blake Hinson only RJ Davis in the way and Hinson so big and strong there wasnt much that Davis could do but he couldnt keep him from scoring and foul him third assist to the night for Carrington hes got four rebounds 21 points threepoint play for Hinson threepoint lead for Carolina and maybe that kind of play can get Blake Hinson going for this last six minutes of Regulation same Low cross screen to free up Bop who goes around Diaz Graham and lays it in hes so good at getting to that Baseline side but that Low cross screen from Ryan just gave him that separation to get the ball on the left Applause block low driving puts the brakes on and misses the turn around out of bounds Carolina ball just after getting that Low cross screen that freed him up and Diaz Graham a little late getting there and he turned away from the double team by low to the Baseline side you have to be prepared for him to spin Baseline every time he gets the ball doesnt matter which side of the lane hes on the immediate double on bot looking crosscourt but before he could make the pass he was fouled with no reason for Diaz Graham to reach there he had Bott picking up his dribble just get your hands high and discourage a straight line Applause pass theres the double he dribbles out of it but you dont need to reach there thats just an obvious foul is fourth he sits Federico back in deflected pass pitch got it good job by low coming over those High hands Leed knocks down to three and its a twopoint game what a big play play by low to get that deflection everybody on the pit bench standing right now at the other end of the Court coaches and players alike but how hard has Pittsburgh fought in this game trying to get to the ACC Championship game for the first time since they joined the league in 2014 Leets got it for pit hit in the semis in their first year in 2014 and the semis this year have never been to the ACC tournament championship game low off balance and he banks it in what a shot how about these two freshman Jay I dont think they have any idea how hard it is to do what theyre doing the Panthers have battled back to tie but not for long thanks to RJ Davis well guess who Armando Bott comes up for the middle ball screen and RJ Davis refuses it to get that Applause three Rico off to Carrington and a foul going against Carolina now its on Armando bot I think he pushed feder Rico into the ball and thats where the foul came from 341 to go boy are guys making tough plays tonight including as you said guys who dont know how tough this is supposed to be going against an outstanding Defender and Seth Trimble gets that Lefty shot off the glass and then RJ Davis refusing the ball screen and going to his right knocking down with so much riding on this one the number one seed the Tarheels the number four seed the Panthers in a game that has been close throughout whats at stake other than getting to the championship game trying to win a tournament Championship pit Joey brackets has him right now first for out who knows remains to be seen well find out but boy win Carolina obviously would be huge for their NCAA tournament chances and with Tennessee losing earlier today in the SEC tournament the door is a jar as they say Jay for a one seed for Carolina so you got you got that story line and then you got the one step closer to winning a championship here storyline yeah I dont think the players are thinking about any of that right now theyre thinking about making the next Music play hit ball down by Applause three a good job by caroled to switch that screen for the screener action Harrington got tripped no call pits still got it and caring to the back up and in the play Hinson has cormack Ryan on him Harrington pulls up around and out Ingram the Applause rebound theyre all looking at Bott does he get a touch here he goes and no double with feder Rico guarding him now it comes and a foul yeah the double team from ishma legga came late Armando bat had already established two feet in the paint by the time legot came over and thats too late hes going to get a score a foul or both if you let him get that deep Bott two for three from the line tonight and shooting a career best seven 88 from the line on the season well have we got you covered on selection Sunday it all starts at 6 Eastern with sports center here on ESPN Reese and the guys will look at the mens field of 68 as the brackets are announced and in Bracketology breaking down each region at 800 the womens field of 68 is revealed again with Bracketology and a complete Applause breakdown tipped out by Ingram but pitch got it under three minutes to go Trimble on carington what a great match up individually now the switch Diaz Graham into Hinson who calls a timeout 245 to go pitball down by four were back in 30 by chro Price well its been Armando B and RJ Davis for North Carolina in this second half Davis in transition but first off the great pass from Bott and Bott has been dominant down in the low post hes got 18 points nine rebounds two assists two Steals and a block shot but he has changed quite a few shots after switching out on guards and moving his feet to stay in front hon driving on Ingram off the rim and down to Davis he got past Ingram but Bott was still back there they have just built a wall around the bucket Bott swings it to Davis hell launch a three and hit it a huge shot for RJ Davis and another great handling of a double team by arando Bott dribbling out and looking opposite third assist of the night for Bott Davis now has 16 points in the second half 22 on the night low has it rejected and botts got it what a defensive performance by Armando Bott to stay in front of a guard and recover then block that shot that is big time and now they can board to be a little bit patient with the clock up by seven now with a minute 40 to go that same screen to get the switch so RJ Davis can take on Jaylen low not this time and Carrington has it for pit wa can he rebound they dont let Hinson get the shot Applause off Harrington guarded by bacock a Applause three and its out of bounds still Panther ball Armando Bott looks like hes enjoying switching out on these guards able to stay in front and then get right back in front of low and then the pass out of the double team to find RJ Davis is there a shot thats too far away for RJ Davis to hit it doesnt look like it the three goggles and hes been wearing those all season long 22 for Davis n 19 and 10 for Bott as both of them have been huge here in the second half for the tar Hills who were down two to pit at halftime playing through Armando Bott has been good for North Music Carolina what a career it has been for Armando Bott five outstanding years 165 games played and just huge rebounding numbers obviously double doubles the Lord tonight is 84 and again with the benefit of the 50 year that helps but still a great great career for Armando Bott putting himself up on a graphic there with Tim Duncan and Ralph Samson two of the alltime greats Ralph Samson the last twotime National player of the year in college basketball Zach Edy about to match that feat so this was not a called timeout this was an official review to see whose ball it should be and it appears its going to be Applause Music pits I think they put one second back on the clock as well a minute 15 and low to inbound it was tied at 62 a 70 Carolina run Applause since into leg good defense by Riot really good defense by Ryan leged finds it looks like somebody was out of bounds I think Bott may have touched the ball when he was out of bounds so its still hit ball now a minute seven Applause too and again theyre going to look at it is there anything worse than a waving finger in the air after the ball goes out of bounds you can only do this inside the last two minutes of Regulation or overtime and if theres any doubt yeah thats out of bounds to Pittsburgh yeah one foot of Bott was touching the ball and the other foot was out of Bounds at the time pretty good game of Twister going on over there on the Baseline at that moment but it should be Pitts ball and itll be low to inbound Music Applause again and again 1 second added to the clock now a minute eight Harrington Trimble had it he got knocked down and wound up out of bounds with the ball so again its piit ball and this time the shot clock reset so its back back at 20 good stand there by Seth Trimble and then he goes up and gets the rebound yeah went out of bounds wasnt sure whether they called the walk or out of bounds there was a lot of contact Hinson Diaz Graham the rebound Carrington for three oh and its a fourpoint game and here comes some pressure Diaz gr is a great job on the glass when hes been in there little one two two 34 court pressure now from Pittsburgh tremble gets it over to Ingram do they play it out or do they Applause foul and the timeout called by Hubert Davis 381 to go Carolina ball up four were back in 30 final minute of Regulation here in the first semifinal at the ACC tournament in Washington the number one seed Carolina trying to hold off a very stubborn determined group of pit Panthers in advance onto the championship game Elliot kdo has checked back into the game for Carolina Trimble is out what a cut by RJ Davis and a foul and thats the last guy you want to send to the free throw line if youre pit and thats why Jeff cable has the uh body language and expression on his face that he has right now thats not what you want to see that was just a great cut RJ Davis cut like he was coming to the ball then cut toward the basket and looked like he was eyeing Harrison Ingram in that right corner when he got fouled 89 on the season now watch this cut by RJ Davis comes off the screen then just back cuts to get the ball and he was looking over toward Harrison Ingram when he got hit in the head there to send him to the foul line and in your opinion is that a play put in during the timeout or is that just Davis just feeling and reading the defense and adjustment well its both if the defense is not playing you go ahead and get the ball straight on but if theyre going to deny use that back cut carington short Davis has it and hes going back to the free throw line and its getting closer and closer right now for Carolina another gutsy gritty performance by North Carolina on the defensive end and there are a lot of players to Credit in white but number one would be Armando bot when he is switched out on the guards he did a fabulous Applause job thre possession Applause game missed it and now no threes no fouls leg it no Bott has it off to Ryan as the seconds tick away and it looks like thats going to be that Carolina got a push from pit but in the end the number one seed will advance to the title game the championship game here in Washington tomorrow night and not surprisingly North Carolina advances to the final based
