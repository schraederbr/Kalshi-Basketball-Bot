now enter sand band in full voice awesome atmosphere here in blackburg we are underway our ACC Saturday night double Eder tips off here from Castle Coliseum and its the hokes that start with the basketball well Georgia Tech comes out in manto man key thing is defending the threepoint line against this Virginia Tech Team uh theyre one of the best in the ACC take a look at the Georgia Tech starting five a team that started year 8 and3 had ranked wins against Duke in Mississippi State theyve fallen into a bit of a slump here losing seven of their last eight but they are very dangerous theyve been in every single one of those games just havent been able to close most of them opportunity on the road against a hokey team thats back to 500 in ACC play we told you both of these teams filled with great Shooters we expect a lot of Threes to be be taken tonight so far thats been the recipe for Virginia Tech wins this season Nathan George missed it fellow freshman Dongo cant clean up the spell a slow start for both teams right here to start this one Applause off heres Lyn kid trying to muscle his way in kicks it out finds Couture MJ Collins for three he cant open the Music Applause scoring these teams 0 for seven in the opening 90 seconds Dongo finally opens the scoring a talented freshman B Dongo continues to lead the way for this yellow T jackets team beautiful pass that time by George to the other freshman Dongo and thats a beautiful pocket pass and finish by the young Georgia Tech Team David Stout relying on those two freshmen to lead the way this season Collins step back immediate answer MJ Collins I love the footwork that time reverse pivot spin around and then soft tuck on the midrange George on the Applause move and Jay this right here uh we were at Virginia Tech shoo around they worked on this right here again rotation late and because the spacing is so good for Georgia Tech the help is there late thats beautiful execution in the half court by Georgia Tech youre going to see a lot of ball screen action with this Georgia Tech Team and Georgia Tech they are not shy particularly The Freshman George and Dongo they go into Cameron Indoor play Duke really well after they beaten the Blue Devils at home in Atlanta their last Road game they take a really good Clemson team to double overtime and win that game so getting their first taste of ACC play on the road in great atmospheres like this one theyve done pretty well so far well Mike young had high praise for what Damon Stam has done early on and a big reason this guy right here Nate George that is tough but then on the other end beautiful postentry pass and won by Kid and again both these teams just watch the spacing when they run their half court sets uh they do an excellent job spacing the floor out kid completes the and one and checks out for malijah poti Mike Young and the hokes without maai long today unavailable due to an injury and potit has given them some nice minutes off the bench against some of these bigger front lines in the ACC big body gaves from the corner cant Music connect this match up between George and padulla is going to be key in this one this afternoon CI doesnt close out on Collins and MJ drills it and thats the key thing again we saw geia Tech and shoot around majority of their shoo around was focused on Closeouts uh you know Virginia Tech is going to shoot them if youre late on the Closeouts theyre going to make you pay Collins shooting just 23 from three this year but knock that one down with ease George in attack mode high off the window doesnt drop and now heres padulla Couture thought about the transition three thats great close out and transition d by Georgia Tech proti the spin cycle and finish malijah Applause potit well potit again I talked about his defense that right there great footwork all set up though by his positioning where he caught the ball oh Georgia Techs going to have to push him out not let him catch the ball that deep into the post pookies have made four in a row its an 8 nothing virgin Tech run they grabed control here at Castle Coliseum to start this one chock loock winding down Reeves hoists it short got his own rebound and threw it Applause Music away right back to poti hands off padulla goes Baseline right back to potit backto back buckets for the big fella and thats all set up by the attention of that padulla draws and Damon stama has seen enough and hes going to get a timeout right now though it has been a Virginia Tech in this run a 10 run cap right here beautiful three and then sha padulla showing off the dime skill it has been all Virginia Tech for me in college basketball Hunter Couture sha padulla right now one of the best scorers uh in the ACC to go along with a good Supporting Cast and youre right Jay here at home this atmosphere is wild and you have an opportunity to stack winds particularly here at home where youre 9 and one on the season Duke will be at Castle Coliseum 48 hours from now for big Monday theres something to be said about just protecting home court in the ACC yeah its huge and theyre going up though against a young but talented uh Georgia Tech Team well last time the yellow jackets were on the road they stunned Clemson and double overtime Kyle stur Off the Bench into the box score his first touch of the game goes for two and thats a nice little rub screen by George again to free up third of him Music Collins has had the hot hand early missed it there great hustle nickel keeps it in Applause Music play padulla fires and hits Sean padulla give an assist to Nicholl again if he doesnt make that hustle play that play does not happen 5050 balls those hustle plays of those wind up being winning plays at the end of the day when you add them all Applause up that was the first shot of the night for padulla who hands it off here rejected at The Rim Ties on Claude nice close out there now coming up next right here on acc Network our double header continues where we take you to Syracuse the orange hosting NC State it its funny Virginia Tech NC State Syracuse all in the same camp which is squarely right on the NCAA tournament bubble its amazing and we talked about this off air Virginia Tex has beaten Iowa State already and they just knocked off Kansas a team that many people think is potentially a final four team so again Im no uh rocket scientist but I would say Virginia Techs pretty good uh just amazing to me that the quality of teams in the ACC and theres talk of potentially only three getting in thats silly he can double that as far as Im concerned Coleman that doesnt drop from three Georgia Tech just three of 11 shooting to start this game heres badulla all the way to the rim everything but the Music Finish Stant nice crossover has a step doesnt use it perfect position for the offensive rebound Ties on Claude count it plus the foul grown man offensive rebound and putback again grown man offensive rebound and putback right here by claw and again thats a big time bucket and one Music Applause opportunity and for as poorly as the yellow jackets have shot it to start this game Damon sty team only trailing by five here on the road and theyve done a great job again hanging around round in games they just been unable to close some out but again they are a very talented Music team and during this stretch where theyve lost seven of eight its the same story theyve got chances to win in the second half and just cant close Damon STM told us the good news is there is no quit in this team know average loss just by eight points five losses by single digits and theyve had chances in every single second half to go and win it and the only time theyve done it at Clemson and again the Freshman point guard uh Nate George again we singled him out at the beginning as our Starwatch but hes a young player again hes going to continue to grow in those situations in terms of controlling the pace and play at the end this match here George going against Lyn kid wants the switch and gets it nickel a three got it Tyler nichel delivers from deep and they got caught on a scramble situation that time Georgia Tech again George trying to switch back wide openen threes that cannot happen against this Virginia Tech Team good ball movement but stent left it Music Music short Music padulla going right at George spinning his way free leaves it off an easy finish for Baron and thats all set up padulla ice that time went to post up the fresman George they had to come over and help another beautiful dime that time by Sha padulla at Virginia Tech doubling up Georgia Tech early 20 to 10 pookies have certainly grabbed control of this game early 5 Seconds to shoot George turn around missed it and that was a fatigue shot right there again hes spending so much energy tasing Couture and Padula that time looked like he was fatigued on that turnaround good look padulla cant connect there yellow jackets have fallen into to another scoring drown of more than 2 Music minutes the Virginia Tech in control here sha padulla leading the way well we talked about his scoring its his dimes early right now that Virginia Tech has they have Georgia Tech spaced out and then right here the close out has to be there quicker if youre not there on the catch Virginia Tech is going to make you pay and thats something Damon STM talked about in terms of what has cost him in games not closing out on Shooters and knowing the shooting a Scouting Report theyre getting there but its little things like that that have cost them sometimes in games and on the offensive end for the yellow jackets theyve started this game shooting just four of Applause 16 the Miles Kelly has it here Georgia Techs leading scorer hes been very quiet to start this game calls his own number Way Off the Mark and hes the one guy Jay I think they have to get going on the offensive side you said it hes their leading scorer and their last game he only took two shots to really struggle to score the ball Hunter Couture makes Georgia Tech pay again again no close out you have to talk if youre the big you have to come up and hedge cant cannot allow Hunter Couture to come off that clean hes shooting 53 in ACC Play From Beyond The Arc Baron a three trying to get in on the ACT great hustle its going to be Georgia Tech ball now the hokes after starting over four from three have made four of their last six every Thursday ACC womens basketball right here on acc Network terrific double header this coming Thursday rivalry game the Commonwealth Clash Virginia at Virginia Tech right here at Castle Coliseum and then another rivalry game UNC at NC State top 20 matchup you dont want to miss it this Thursday right here on acc Network well this stretch right here important for Georgia Tech it feels like they havt scored in an eternity again they need to have a good halfcourt set here I think theyve been settling early in the the shot clock for some deep threes see if you can work the ball around left or right and get a higher percentage shot yeah more than 230 without a bucket by Dongo trying to change that missed it cant think of a time today where Georgia Tech has gotten a clean look now thats a great job again pushing Dango out by Music peti Collins right to the rim and it rolls in MJ Collins with seven to lead all scorers at Virginia Tech on a 10 nothing run Reeves trying to end it bounces out to George who fires the three he cant connect another offensive rebound and finally Ties on Claude ends the scoring drought of near four minutes and I like this change up by Damon stmy a go little fullcourt pressure again its a soft pressure but theyre just trying to give a Virginia Tech a different look and now they go to Zone looks like theyre in a matchup zone right now can see if you can slow down this Virginia Tech offense Kelly poked it away gets it back lays it up and in defense into offense Georgia Tech has lacked that and the change has worked again that time forcing a turnover again theyre giving them some full court pressure and now theyre going to drop back into a matchup Zone Baron knocks it down thats how you beat the Zone youre absolutely right beautiful execution that time break pressure and get the ball to the soft spot the middle of that zone KY cant connect from three and thats a tough shot right there by Kelly again not much ball movement high ball screen and then you take a deep contested three Collins lost the handle but Virginia Tech in the driver yet nine assists on 11 made shots today you just watch the hokes right now Malcolm theyre playing with great offensive Rhythm and flow they are and for Georgia Tech again that I think has been problematic for them during this stretch where theyve struggled really to score too many uh quick shots early in the shot clock they need to be a little bit more patient Music offensively and Virginia Tech arguably playing the best basketball of their season right now in late January went on the road beat NC State followed it up with a good win against Boston College and now here at home trying to make it three in a Music row and thats I think something Malcolm that should be factored into the metrics maybe a little more is okay nonconference plays November your season doesnt end there you can improve like Virginia Tech has in December into January and you have to expect Mike Youngs team to get even better February March and Jay weve talked about this obviously with the transfer portal youre bringing in new guys into a system and youre right though right now Georgia excuse me Virginia Tech playing some of the best basketball B in the ACC on the other side again for Georgia Tech that was a really good offensive possession for them the ball moved left to right and then they got the ball into the paint to Claude now hes at the free throw line made the second Claude leading the yellow jackets tonight with six of Georgia Tech 15 David S scking with this pressure and thats been good for them again thats a slow Dumb down sumon now the issue though becomes in the zone that they drop back to you must identify three and zero Couture and padulla are on the Music perimeter Couture left alone hell make you pay Hunter Couture automatic and Ill sound like a broken record if youre going to play zone you must find those two guys instant response Debo Coleman and immediately Damon stmy comes out of the Zone again its just really difficult to play zone in terms of finding your assignments making sure you dont lose those two guys inside to LY kid going right at the Freshman Dongo and thats a great move ly kid making it look easy inside well I think the key thing with Dango again hell learn you cant let a guy catch the ball that deep into paint Collins cant connect Virginia Tech has gotten some great looks in this game Mal take a look at this spacing right here again overhead youre playing Zone you got to know the scouting report this guy right here Couture shooting 53 from the threepoint line thats a breakdown cant give him that much air space Coleman on the end a great close out by nichel so exactly what youre talking about on Georgia Techs end nickel does on Virginia Tech end the home fans not happy with the call it stays with the yellow jackets underneath well the good news uh for Georgia Tech it feels like theyre down 30 uh theyre still within a Striking Distance again theyve struggled offensively and just shooting 27 Stripped Away way Couture inside to kid and hes having his way inside right now ly kid time out Damon Stout it is all hokes here at Castle Applause Coliseum Virginia Tech shooting better than 50 from the floor and theyre getting it out side and inside wel right now Jay look where kids catching the ball again two feet inside the paint any post player you let him catch it that close to the basket theyre going to score or youre going to have to foul them that has got to change again we talked about it the big to Georgia Tech have to do their uh work before The Bigs of Virginia Tech get down the court and push them out of the paint right now its just too easy and this is the danger zone for Damon stoutmire now the one thing that he told us is that there is no quit in this group theyre better than their record they are going against their Virginia Tech team that has been very good very balanced and right now in the danger zone you cant let it get worse than this before halftime yeah and again offensively again thats where its been the struggle and defensively but offensively again be a little bit more patient and deliberate if youre Georgia Tech Dongo trying to muscle his way to the rim draws the Music foul going back to the Hokey balance scoring theyve played seven players they dont have a lot of depth on this Virginia Tech Team but all seven have scored yeah again its its okay when your seven is really good and that has been the case right now uh but also whos been really good is this guy on the free throw line by Dango really goodlooking freshman for Georgia Tech and the future is very bright for Damon STM and Georgia Tech Ive been impressed with his play uh early on Dango in ACC Music Applause play Dongo knocks down the second allows Georgia Tech to set their pressure here poua making it look easy leads to a wideopen three rattles in and out no good offensive rebound poti is fouled Virginia Tech they are just in some sort of Rhythm offensively fun to watch next weeks ACC Friday night wrestling duel number 8 NC State hosting North Carolina at Reynolds Coliseum rivalry is real in every sport so this should be a good one Friday night duels ACC wrestling it begins 830 Eastern on Music Friday and J the guy at the line potit has really been I think an ex factor for Virginia Tech Off the Bench uh hes battled some really good bigs over the last few games Quenton post the Boston College nor Shad oir DJ Burns again he provides a presence for them widebody very strong base to battle with those bigs Reeves Couture took a shot there on the ensuing Applause Music rebound it was Coleman who is going for the ball on the rebound and Couture took a big knock good to see him up and again I dont think theres anything uh malicious about about it again its a guy thats trying to go get an offensive rebound but it was a violent it was definitely a violent Collision theyre going to go take a look at it now again the initial live what I saw two guys just going after an offensive rebound trying to again if youre Georgia Tech youre just trying to yeah again and Im not sure I Im not sure he hit him I think it was the fall afterwards that did again Couture fell backwards and I think thats where the damage took place again yeah thats a tough Music Collision now heres what the rule says Jay again excessive unnecessary not a legitimate play on the ball hold or push from behind now for me I think hes definitely trying to go get the basketball uh question in terms of whether or not it was excessive or Music not and the ref just ruled it common foul a common foul and I agree with that because of the intent and I think the intent as you stated perfectly was Coleman was going for the basketball its a team again hes in there and Im sure Damon stym is talking to him whos going to play with some heart whos going to go for those 5050 balls whether its offensive rebounds or scramble Music situations Couture stays in the game his partner in crime padulla lobs it up poti rejected at The Rim Dongo brought it down but fell down on the line so itll stay Hokes ball and this is a great recovery by Dongo right here again looks like potit going to have an uncontested layup Tango says not so fast and thats great team defense though by Georgia Tech the Jay again Virginia Tech with their spacing they are going to test your helps side defense Georgia Techs going to need to strain together some stops down by 17 on the road theyve got a mountain The Climb here in blackburg foul called potit driving right at Claude and hell head back to the line on Tuesday in the win against Boston College Virginia Tech was a perfect 16 of 16 from the foul line they are number two in the entire country in free throw percentage at 80 as a team so not only do they get to the line a fair amount but when theyre there they shoot at 80 and that is such a luxury and again Jay we talked about their balance as you take a look at their ranks the number two in all of college basketball but I think the big thing we talk about balance in terms of the amount of guys seven guys scoring but I think its the balance on how they score theyre beating right now Georgia Tech on the inside again yes we know they can shoot the three ball but Ive been impressed with how theyre bigs in particular uh po has has done a great job establishing the paint of for Virginia Tech and the hokes doubling up Georgia Tech here 3819 theyve been in control the entire first half Reeves has a step lost the handle Claude trying to dig it out and a foul Music called and then defensively Jay again Virginia Tech really making it difficult for Georgia Tech to get anything going offensively again there have been very few clean looks for Georgia Tech in his first half thus far I cant think of one even tough to get the inbounds Applause in and Nathan George The Fearless freshman hes been Applause quiet shot clock down to seven Claude has to hurry to George padulla all over him the floater doesnt Music drop and George has had a couple of those where again hes gotten by the initial Defender just unable to finish padulla fading away nothing but air now Georgia Tech trying to string together some stops trailing by 19 Virginia Tech been dominant uh where well be standing at the end of uh March in terms of teams that get in and Ill tell you that middle part of the AC to me as good as any League out there you look at teams like Miami wake North Carolina State uh really this team on display right here tonight Virginia Tech man is going to be a fun finish in the ACC know and can a team like Virginia Tech start to separate themselves from the midle of the pack if they hold on to this lead and theyre well on their way itd be three straight conference wins to five and four what a rejection potit hes been terrific tonight on both ends player to game so far in the first half for Virginia Tech but not just his offensive production but that right there Rim protection looked like its going to be a dunk and potit comes out of nowhere and denies him on the other end puts it up and in but Elijah potit hes stolen the headline tonight hes just playing like a grown man out there right now again beautiful hands and finish by poti he is doing it on both ends for Virginia Music Tech back door rejection again potit says no backto back blocks for him foul called gets Collins you got to take another look at this wow well tonight he is just denying everything right here you think you got a dunk nope and then again another beautiful angle of the block by potit and then the last one for me right here hes like no not today and again he is providing Rim protection and production offensively uh for Virginia Music Tech Georgia Tech shooting seven of 30 in this first half just 23 3 they needed that three in a big way Carter Murphy Off the Bench for the yellow jackets trying to provide a spark desperately needed back to potit why not its been working for the hokes in this first Music half M well Jay po has done a little bit of everything of for Virginia Tech again the points uh I think the presence in the paint with the rebounds and the blocks to me really has been a big reason why uh Georgia Tech has struggled to get anything going at the Music paint foul called on Cy trying to deny coutur is even catching the ball right now youre trailing 18 minute 44 to go again if youre Damon stom youre trying to just obviously get this thing to as close to single digits as possible uh before you go into the half and get any momentum going into the Music half nickel left alone its too easy for Virginia Tech today oh miscommunication that time again uh no switch no Music help C they need him to get going a big three there by Miles Kelly Georgia Techs leading scorer on the season that might be their best offensive possession of the half J again ball went left to right got into the paint out to the wing and an extra pass for a wideopen three theyre going to need more of that poti got it again he has a season High 12 points just in the first half tonight well I didnt think we were going to come into this game talking about having the double poti but uh that may be the case and Murphy though has given a nice boost off the bench for Damon STM again thats two threes he hit and they have been huge to try to cut into this deficit trying to find something anything headed into halftime to be positive about nickel quick release cant Music connect and Nathan George slowing things down Yellow Jackets will take the final shot out of this first half 5 Seconds to work with Murphy whos hit two threes Off the Bench a deep One Way Off the Mark and Virginia Tech one obviously um they got their work cut out for him again starts with their defense uh its been too easy for Virginia Tech and then on this side right here offensively you got to get some swings uh offensively of the ball I felt they were shooting early in the shot clock in the first half and taking some tough contested Music threes Georgia Tech shot under 30 in that first half by dong go trying to get them going off the Applause Music mark whereas Virginia attch better than 50 from the floor theyre getting it inside outside really wherever they went they had success Lin kid too easy inside that time with the left hand well you have to win the first Bump J again right now of The Bigs of Virginia Tech theyre just catching the ball or working their way and getting two feet inside the paint thats just too deep if youre Georgia Tech Nathan George trying to get the yellow jackets going Music the good news though Jay it feels like theyre down more than 16 theyre only down 16 after shooting 29 from the floor in that first Music half with an entire second half to play it would still take a Herculean effort but youre right Hawk Down but not out padulla has a step leaves it up Collins went for the onehanded Jam Music Kelly driving right to the rim Miles Kelly thats more like it and beautiful hes too important to their team hes their leading scorer and that time attacks the REM Beautiful finish with the left and just like that theyre down Music 14 Kelly on the defensive end great denial Falls to Lyn kid spinning his way in ly kid dominant to start this second half Reeves transition three drills in kaasi Reeves the immediate answer I like that again set your uh dont let that Virginia Tech uh defense get set up that time off of a makan wow off the ball sha padulla clearly in pain doubled over now couldnt see what Happ he went by oh Applause yeah now Im not I mean again how do you how do you interpret that right there again obviously the GU passing through well I think the one thing you could say is that its unnecessary if youre by Dongo you dont you dont have to do it absolutely again now again the rule has Chang the rule has changed obviously uh guys cutting through freedom of movement that type deal now the intent did he mean to again from that angle right there hard to say that theyre not going to ca something uh with that angle right there again clearly hes just trying to cut through hes not setting his screen does it go to the level of a flagrant and thats going to be the key right here again if youre a v a Georgia Tech you have a little bit of momentum going really just no need for it right there again uh youre kind of killing whatever momentum you have and obviously if they call this a flagrant certainly again that will deflate any uh momentum that you have gained to start off this second half thats exactly right killer for first year head coach Jamon stouty your team starts the second half you make three of four get a couple stops and even the review taking a few minutes halts any momentum youve built were about to get the call here at the table yeah sound like how do you Music inter what do we got H so so it kind of with a smile but just how do you interpret that a Grace its just a play on again uh unintentional contact thats what theyre going to rule it and going to play on and certainly though again uh I think that its the right Music call padulla in attack mode leaves it for kid who hammers it Applause home well Padula has been more of a facilitator tonight thats another beautiful dime off a high ball screen C Kelly really crafty Miles Kelly a Georgia Tech has made four in a row here and thats the key word crafty footwork really on point right there beautiful drive and finish by Kelly again after the yellow jackets were ice cold in the first half four made shots here in the second all right in a row and this find though by Sha padulla look at that wrap around that is a beautiful pass to kid who finishes right here he hung in the a a little bit and then finding kid for the Finish thats a big time pass by Sha padulla Lin kid is now taken over as the leading scorer tonight for the hokes with 13 points to his name so the two bigs potit and kid now combine 26 points with one more free throw to come so all the attention all season for Virginia Tech has been the dynamic duo in the back court of padulla and Couture but its poti and kid that is stealing the show here tonight in blackburg and I like the patience again uh padulla and Couture continue to feed those guys again know what your advantage is and play to it Dongo that drops in so make it five straight makes for the yellow jackets here again another beautiful pass by George to Dango and Dango again I love his touch thats a difficult little jump Hook from the F line Baron on a line drive rocks the rim so even though Georgia Techs made five straight they cant get a stop on the other end to cut into this lead Damon STM not happy with that defense right there again and thats really too easy help has to be there but you just cant get beat Reeves traveled and Virginia Tech continuing to get it done inside right here again youre going to take a look at Baron down the lane check the rim that is a big time finish on the bubble seven teams I Ill say this again IA State just knocked off Kansas uh this Virginia Tech team beat Iowa State um to me I think again you look at everybody talks about metrics and all that a Virginia Tech to me is a very good team and a tournament team in my opinion along with a lot of others in the ACC well and they have found form here in January this would be their third straight win going inside to poti rejected by Dongo hes a great rim protector the phenomenal freshman by Dongo and I like that adjustment by Georgia Tech they bring help that time off of poti and they get the block deep three Reeves rattled in and out no good tapped around and potin grabs it to potin and another big time finish the dribble penetration is just hurting Georgia Tech in this game uh padulla and Couture are just breaking them down and then theyre drawing a Defender and dumping it off a potit or kid Reeves nothing but the bottom of the net Georgia Tech dangerous threepoint shooting team thats how you can claw back on the road if you can continue to knock down triples well there is no quit in this team again uh Damon STM has done a great job with these guys continuing having them to play hard padulla contested three left it short offensive rebound second effort nickel he cant cash him if youre Georgia Tech just try and get it to single digits right keep chipping away thats the thing Chip Away hang around but this has been the problem right here Jay the dribble drives again Couture breaking them down off the bounds drawing the help and then poti again they might have to check the rims on this poti he is massive right here big time finish and thats just a beautiful find by Couture a season High 14 points only averages five and his fellow front Court mate Lyn kid with 15 so those two have combined for 29 wow shot clock at seven Great feed from Kelly and a tip in by Dongo there to clean up the spell and Georgia Tech starting to get better offensive possessions thats a beautiful skip pass that time by Kelly dont settle for a three Drive the ball but then you get an offensive rebound great spacing and patience Georgia teex made Seven of their last nine padulla drawing the foul there right now 1330 to go youre trailing 12 again it felt like it just felt like they were down more than that theyre right within Striking Distance they just got a string together obviously multiple uh stops on defense but I think the biggest thing couple things one The Bigs and then the dribble penetration really has hurt them and force Georgia Tech to help off the bigs now the first half David sers team shot just 29 from the floor in the second half theyre shooting 70 s of 10 to start this second half Nicholl steps out for three and knocks it down Tyler nichel thats his second triple Music Applause Music tonight so improved offense but still strug Ling on the defensive endend Georgia Tech and the lead stays at 15 Damon stmm talked about the actions of that Virginia Tech runs again faked like youre sending a pin down and then you step out and thats just a read right there thats not necessarily a set play thats read and react theyre reading off of how youre defending it beautiful uh offense by Virginia Tech but if youre Georgia Tech again you have to be connected we talked about it they got Shooters all around but you have to be connected and communicate well defensively if youre Georgia Music Tech George driving at Couture sent him flying steps back Dongo there to tip it in again identical from what he did on the previous possession what Georgia Tech has done is theyve matched the physicality of Virginia Tech in the second half remember in that first half Virginia Tech just dominated them now that has changed Georgia Tech has matched their physicality and I guarantee you that was the conversation Damon STM had with his team uh in that halftime were just getting out physical Mike young and David STM heated over on the Music sideline the clock issue that the officials need to look Music at now while the officials attend to the clock good time to remind you every Thursday womens basketball double header right here on acc network two great rivalry matchups its the Commonwealth Clash to get things started at six Virginia Virginia Tech and then NC State number 17 of the country hosting Carolina at 8 rivalry night womens basketball this Thursday its fun watching Damon St first year head coach of Georgia Tech coming over from the NBA obviously where he was a terrific player and then assistant coach with the Boston Celtics he is active over on that sideline coach of this team well we saw him at shoot around he was out there uh getting in on the plays as well too and uh what a wealth of knowledge and again weve talked about the impact uh and he talked with us about the impact that lud olssen had on him uh his college coach at Arizona the legendary coach and you take a look at his resume he has been around obviously college and pro and I had a chance to play against him when he was uh in college as well too and certainly uh one of the better players to Long NBA career and putting together an impressive coaching resume as well too yeah you mention his college head coach at Arizona Lou Olson you know statam Myerss from the Pacific Northwest so they were on the road playing Pack 12 basketball they had a double header Oregon on Friday and then Oregon State on Sunday so on the off day on Saturday Olsons just listening to local radio and theyre talking about how statamire is back playing in his home state of Oregon and theyre theyre kind of talking about him negatively so olssen picks up the phone and calls into the radio show and rips the host a new one so statam Myers showing up to the game theyre like did you hear what coach did hes like what called into the radio shows so he said thats what he loved about him is that no matter if you were the star player the 12th man on the bench he would go to battle for you and he wants to emulate that with his guys and you you watch the way he coaches he coaches with such passion well right now his team is on a in a battle on the road in a hostile environment and theyre battling again thats something uh that they have done again right now in this game trailing 13 little under 13 minutes to go against the very good Virginia Tech Music Team gor leaves it for kid count it plus the foul Virginia Tech feasting inside tonight and this is all set up by Couture uh Couture held off his Defender right here again look at him freeze it and then KN there the dime to kid that has been the problem all night of for Georgia Tech of their inability to keep padulla and kador out of the paint and and the result has been kid and with big Knights offensively now how about this Couture and padulla have as many assists as they do points tonight theyve combined for nine points nine assists and they have let the big man kid in potit be the stars of this show Georgia Tech going inside and Claude delivers the duck beautiful pass by stov it again set play uh Mike young had huge Praise of for Damon stanmire the sets that they run thats a beautiful set play pinpoint passing which led to a dunk now can Georgia Tech get a stop theyve picked it up on the offensive end but they failed to chip away because of the defensive struggles they get the turnover right on Q Damon STM plenty of passion over on that visiting sideline Virginia Tech still up 14 obviously uh the ACC wants all their teams to do well but no easy outs and I think Damon STM the staff that he put together Carl Hobs uh longtime uh guy thats been in this business former head coach uh at GW and then a longtime assistant at Ruckers one of the most wellrespected names on that staff along with Boni Wells and Ill tell you what but uh they are going to be very good and years to come they continued to battle on the road theyve been down by as many as 21 in this game and now theyve cut it to 11 and I think thats the thing thats impressive young team on the road the way Virginia Tech came out and jumped on them they could have easily rolled over they continued to fight in this game and the fight on the sideline for first year head coach Damon satam kid trying to spin his way free good defense and its intercepted sturdivan has it up to George Who lays it in and Georgia Tech has cut it to single digits four makes in a row that big lead of 21 is down to nine you cant run transition offense any better off the steel unselfish play that led to a layup Collins leaves it short Georgia Tech on a s nothing run over the last 80 Music Applause Seconds they have trailed All Night Long by as many as 21 they have continued the Battle 5 seconds on the shot clock Coleman travels no foul on the floor first called against nickel and Jay their defense has picked up and its led to transition opportunities right here get the steal unselfish play layup that is textbook transition offense off the turnover and Damon stym continues uh to push this team uh to get better and again I think uh closing out games really has been the issue for them a late in games theyve been in a lot of games but closing come out I think thats going to be the key to this one as well too well but the fight just to get back into it you know youre a team thats lost seven of eight youve hit a slide youre on the road in a hostile environment and youre down 21 a lot of teams would roll over Georgia Techs done the opposite of that cut it to single digits here and plenty of time to work with stent musling his way in missed it falls right back to him and that time it doesnt drop in either that ball went in and out a pretty good offensive possession for Georgia Tech they come up Music empty Virginia Tech get a scoring drown of near three minutes here did badulla shake them out of Music it feed inside foul called Robbie Baron heads to the foul line for two and its little things like that again theyre right there but on that help side you have to get in front of the big when your rotation comes you got to get down again the dribble drive has hurt them all night but again outside Murphy again hes late you got to get in front on that right there youre late the end result you have to foul Virginia tack a perfect nine for nine from the foul line tonight after they were a perfect 16 of 16 on Tuesdays win against Boston College that is such a weapon particularly closing games when you are automatic at the foul line absolutely second in college basketball close to 83 from the free throw line as a team inside Dongo dangerous passer padulla all over stur of it great defense third event again thats twice now he had couple of clean looks just unable to finish at The Rim even though the hokes got the free throws on the last possession still not a made Basket in 330 Couture trying to change that he misfires thats a great blockout that time by Dano Kelly draws the foul Virginia Z Jay Ive been impressed with the leading score for Georgia Tech Kelly not just his offense but defensively I think that has been the key thing in this game hes been really good uh defensively fighting over uh ball screens and then they certainly need his offensive production shooting into the castle guard not an easy task for Georgia Tech in this second half one of the best student sections in all of college basketball they have been loud and proud all night long trying to wield this hokey team to their third straight Conference Applause win Kelly now into double digits for Georgia Tech and here they go again I think this was a good change for them in the first half going to the full court pressure Music heres padulla crosscourt pass so unselfish great ball movement Collins wide openen look everything but the Finish there if they made that I was going to say that would have been a clinic on how how you move the ball in the half court thats a clean look off of excellent ball Applause movement Dongo going right into poti beautiful footwork The Freshman delivers and hes got some of the best footwork for a freshman big you hit it right on the head right there again footwork clinic right there by the Freshman by Dango and George Tech continues to stick and hang around in this game with this young team right here Dango with the footwork Clinic big boys leading the way for Virginia Tech inside kid and PTI really have been the story in this game both those guys from combining for over 30 points uh in this game uh theyve done a nice job the guards Couture and padulla finding them but it has been the two big been putting up big numbers for Virginia Tech in this game a season High 14 for potit ly kid with 18 but with 748 left to play Virginia Tech they led by as many as 21 tonight that lead has shrunk down to seven so theyre going to need potit and kid to stay dominate down the stretch trying to cling to what would be a third straight Conference win here in the ACC Music pulla contested three drills it Sean padulla knocks down a huge three out of the timeout well Damon STM we saw them at the shoter around talking about that right there again padulla and Couture you have to be there on the catch uh but these two guys are two of the better Shooters not just in the ACC but in college basketball right here sea patula deep three loing it could be Jay alter with you and I got to go back to coach though can we get him some floor seats I mean what is he got to do to get some floor seats can we get coach down on the floor sold out tonight Castle Coliseum seats tough to tough to come by hes lucky to be in the building and uh hes got to be happy with how the basketball teams been playing today and you know Georgia Tech cut it to seven Mike young takes a timeout draws up a great play for padulla who hits the three gives a little more cushion 10point lead little more than seven minutes left to play Kelly he triggers the Deep three Off the Mark hoks Ball well not a bad look by Kelly just way off the mark on that and you take a look at the home a court advantage this is uh really one of the louder Arenas to play in on the road in the Music ACC kids got a game high 18 hands off for Baron and now Couture padulla who just hit the big three decides to call his number again nothing but the bottom of the net Jay thats two breakdowns the big you got to step up in heads the late close out on the one before and in that time padulla coming off clean again uh thats just a breakdown defensively uh by Georgia Tech again were going to take a look at the high ball screen right here again the big you got to come out and slow him down you cant flatten out against one of the better Shooters in college basketball again thats just a knowing the scouting report a little thing when youre trying to claw back into a Music game and thats the fourth foul against ly kid so potit has to come relieve kid here at the front Court Virginia Tech operating with a short bench only have played Seven guys and theyve all scored at least six points or more George hes been off tonight just three of 10 from the floor for the Freshman George Tech Ben felt like George was hit on that pullup Music jumper Couture losing his balance got rid of it just in time and steps out for three and buries it Hunter Couture three straight threes for Virginia Tech courtesy padulla and Couture time out Georgia Tech we step aside as well the hokeys Applause rolling if you

last one knowing your scouting report a padulla Couture you cant leave them if you are going to help you got to be there on the catch you look at the spacing its too late bucket right there and Couture again shooting 53 of from the threepoint line in ACC play Coutures flat on his back in the paint and 3 seconds later hes knocking down a triple I didnt say it was easy guarding him uh but again uh thats what this back court uh does to teams against they shoot the ball so well and Couture that was his 299th made three one more and he joins the 300 Club hell be the 13th player in ACC history to do it and the first hokey to ever do Applause it foul off the ball Kelly tangled up with Couture this game getting chippy again ref stepping in veteran crew they are are going to try to clean this up but this game has been physical in the second half and again the Georgia Tech uh definitely uh came out and matched the energy and intensity in the second half and refs are talking to both uh teams now and theyre trying to clean this thing up now one more game still to come tonight on acc Network that Syracuse at Etsy State and then after catch up on what has been a busy Saturday in the ACC nothing but net Joel Barry Carlos Boozer Luke Hancock and Kelsey rigs have you cover that is tonight at 9 right here on acc Network certainly a lot to talk about in that Clemson Duke game the Blue Devils holding on to win by one the Duke will be here at Castle Coliseum for big Monday 48 hours from now virgin 524 to go in this game thats huge Georgia Tech and the bonus obviously both teams now uh in a bonus situation so again thats huge and plenty of time left in this game obviously if your Tech on the road you got to start having some positive things go your way Dongo misses the front Applause end after the yellow jackets had cut it to seven Virginia Tech on a nine nothing run over the last two minutes padul has been the Catalyst Baron off his leg Dongo keeps it in play Georgia Tech with a sense of urgency here need points in a hurry Reeves from the corner missed Music Applause Music Music it Collins leaves it off poti another fantastic finish season High 16 points for poti tonight thats a break for Virginia looked like Georgia Tech was going to have a turn over and there just 5050 ball goes the way of Virginia Tech and the end result another dunk by poti 11 nothing hokey run over the last three minutes and right there Georgia Tech thinks they have a turnover Collins with the beautiful dime and poti with another finish that is now 20 assists for Virginia Tech Applause tonight and thats a key Point uh Jay theyve done a nice job sharing the ball in particular padulla and Couture they have set up a kid and also peti time after time tonight off of excellent dribble drives Applause Music Music heres Couture back to padulla step step back missed it thats great individual defense by Miles Kelly on padulla forced him into a tough contested jumper were going to count the basket gend Robbie Baron disagrees 15point game Virginia Tech trying to close it out make it three ACC wins in a Music row win so Virginia Tech on the bubble right now but you look at those next five games some great resume opportunities if you can win them I I think thats the key word opportunities and certainly a lot of landmines as well too obviously first things first 347 to go youre up 15 take care of the ball obviously the full court pressure by Georgia Tech youre going to run some clock seeing that obviously youre in a bonus situation key thing is dont want to turn the ball over Music Kor before he could get the shot off offensive foul called against malel po the alltime hokes threepoint leader sitting at 299 thought he was about to take and make what would be number 300 in what has been a historic career here in blackburg for Couture Dongo hes had a tough night going against kid in potit and I think thats the key thing theyve wore him down uh really hes been banging with those two all night helping on ball screens again Virginia Tech a very difficult team if youre an opposing big to match up with because again they run a lot of action that involved their bigs and remember our ACC double had continues with Syracuse at NC State coming up right after were done here in blackburg kept Alive by patula Baron loads up and drills it Applause bar that is 10 made threes for Virginia Tech Applause tonight Dongo continues to clean up the offensive glass Music Applause Music well this has been the type of night its been uh for Virginia Tech theyve had Georgia Tech spread out all over the court right here back door cut by padulla and thats just about as wide open as you can be right there and again because of the spacing by of Virginia Tech they just spread you out and theyve had Georgia Tech chasing all afternoon well thats just it h its easy to say close out but the way they space you it it becomes so hard to follow that scouting report it really has and I think though the big number uh coming into this one the focus was on padulla and Couture but really the story of the game has been Elijah patite and Len kid those two guys really uh have been a force dominating the paint for Virginia Tech in this game yeah watching Virginia Tech tonight its e easy to say that the hokes are playing their best basketball of the Season here in the end of January closing in on what would be a third straight win continuing to bolster that NCAA tournament resume hard foul on Music Baron he got sandwich there on his way to the rim well the one thing Damon STM talk to us about is his guys continue to play and again as a coach you dont want guys giving up whether youre down 18 uh or 16 it doesnt make a difference and these guys continue to play hard obviously right there not wanting to give up a uncontested Music dunk again Damon STM with a young team but again already doing some positive things with this program Che on the other side uh Mike young talked to us about how his teams playing their best basketball right now and he was spot on again balance again the two backourt players two of the best in college but I think the addition of the production of their bigs really has been impressive just feels like the hokeys have continued to improve throughout this season in a good time for Duke to come to town on Monday fouls on geia T number 12 Tai John CL thats his third 19 foul Barons going to head right back to the foul line and this is where the hokes are a really tough team to come back on down the stretch because theyre so good shooting free throws number two in the entire country and 80 on the year yeah again its a l uh that Mike Youngs has all of his guys very good free throw shooters including their bigs full I think though Baron as you take a look at the numbers Baron is another guy J I feel like uh hes given them really good production knocking down the three but I think defensively he has been solid tonight for Virginia TCH Music Music final two minutes here at Castle Coliseum Virginia Tech got out to it early lead and has kept their foot firmly on the gas Georgia Tech had cut to seven the Couture and padulla with some timely threes as Couture continues to operate well he continues to snake those ball screens that time off a hard curl cut of the Defenders behind him he snakes through this time he scored for himself uh but throughout this game though hes either scored or set himself up again right here a watch the curl cut you take a look at some extracurricular stuff refs are going to go take a look but take a look at this curl by Couture in snake the ball screen hold your Defender off and then you got a clear path and thats all set up because earlier on in the game theyve been uh setting their uh bigs up and that time the help doesnt come now the refs are over at the monitor Jay now again I think its more he felt like uh poti was stepping over him and Claude took exception to that felt like potit was stepping over him and Claude went over to protect now again I dont think theres much there its a little shove in the Music back and again now I think a warning again and they want to clean this up go talk to both coaches but I dont think theres anything flagrant about that I dont think that shove was hard enough uh but again they may want to send a message potentially some type of technical foul unsportsman like on both teams and then uh tell both of them to knock it off I think thats what theyre going to wind up doing thats just a guess yeah I think I agree with you 19point game a minute 30 two to go you just go over to both benches hey lets get out of here clean nobody get Music hurt theyre giving an explanation now uh to Mike Music young so it looks like the officials are going to call a dead ball technical foul against taizon Claude for that shove in the back and that makes sense again I dont think obviously anything more than that thats just more okay were going to uh give you a tech you go to your corner and then thats it lets just get out of here clean a minute 32 to go and I think thats the right Music call and Damon STM talking to uh Claude about that but again young team I also think though now hold on a second we were told it was on claw so the normal foul that was called prior to the dead ball foul and then Virginia Techs going to get some foul shots on the other end shooting for the technical fou Applause Music Applause 34 he has been The X Factor both he and Link kid have I think been The X Factor uh in this game combining for well over 30 points but I think its poti defense uh his Rim protection in this game really uh has been huge to go along with his dominance of the paint and with those free throws potit ties a careerhigh 18 points he and kid each with 18 so combined 36 in what has been a dominant effort for the hokes Music tonight and Couture and padulla out of the game for Virginia Tech this will make it three straight ACC wins as Virginia Tech continues to bolster their tournament resume Duke will be in the building here in blackburg 48 hours from now Damon STM continues to coach his team but he has not stopped coaching over on that sideline again obviously the game right now in hand for Virginia Tech but he knows again but these are all learning experiences for his Applause team on the other side Mike young going to get his starters out of the game or guys that uh play huge roles and he has to be pleased Jay with how his team performed really start absolutely to finish well they were just impressive how they shared the basketball over 20 assists in this game Music and it was balanced it wasnt just one guy uh everybody got involved in the action and even the bench getting in on the action Camden from the Applause corner and what has been a terrific team effort tonight here at Applause Music Applause Music Applause home the offense firing it on all cylinders have rung up 88 they have left no doubt nickel put him over 90 an offensive explosion here in blackburg tonight and I think thats been the key Jay how theyve assisted uh most of their buckets tonight were off of assist they did a phenomenal job of Virginia Applause Music Tech of sharing the basketball but compl team performance but it was The Bigs tonight kid and poti for Virginia Tech dominant performance pookies leave no doubt final score 91
