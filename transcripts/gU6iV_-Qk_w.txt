Applause State hokes won the last meeting of the two a year ago in blackburg Virginia won here at jpj in January of 24 Cavaliers with DayDay Ames running the point have the ball First Virginia beat Miami 8271 Wednesday night Virginia Tech was a winner by 10 at Tallahassee against Florida State on the drive Murray had it stripped and this is Tyler Johnson the outstanding freshman from Orlando and you get a look at the Hoke lineup from Mike young shoot Johnson Hammond LW and Migel potin theres a back door love and low cant finish the D its a tough pass and Buchanan was in great position Wes but you throw that ball up there the only guy who can get it is lall you see Murray and Buchanan both on the floor heres a little bounce and a l up for and West youre going to see a lot of that today Virginia Tech they are so conscious of Isaac mcney I think the other guys from Virginia are going to have opportunities poti a hand off for shoot shoots averaged about nine in his last three he had 16 at Florida State the other night heres Johnson trying to squeeze Baseline against AES got some help from Buchanan five to shoot potit on the hard drive against its Kofi cant finish LW the rebound and a foul on the deck whistled by Michael kits I believe against Buchanan and it is on Blake Buchanan the sophomore from cordine and Idaho first on Virginia well Virginias defense has a hard time if they if the opponent can get great penetration off the dribble because it draws the defense you dont have anybody there to rebound the ball defensively shoot MCN played over the top of the L screen potit out front heres shoot on a kick back for hammock young freshman leaning in and one on the foul by ases so Ben Hammond who had six points two assists the other night opens the scoring for the hokes west but that is only his seventh excuse me his eighth made field goal in ACC play and the mistake that GES made is he runs out trying to defend the three Hammond has only made two threepoint baskets in ACC play shoots under 30 hes more dangerous driving the ball as he showed you right there Hammonds got three the hokes are in front and weve played just better than 90 seconds of the Cavaliers and hokes and you see this Cavalier lineup of course that has Murray and Buchanan along with Kofi Andrew roie who missed the game at Miami the other night is at the table to check check in for Virginia Elijah Saunders will not play tonight for the Cavaliers seven to shoot for AES step back two is good DayDay Ames averages three and a half against the lead both teams starting in manto man Johnson against Murray really good movement for both teams on the offensive end so far west three spins out for Jaden sh Im interested to see the shots they get Dan against I thought Virginia tched the other night at Tallahassee and you noted it today very good defensively can they keep that part of their game going heres mcne on the board twopoint shot for Isaac mcne Cavaliers have hit three of their first four from the Applause floor W thats a good question and you dont you never know that that was an impressive defensive performance byg Virginia Tech and Virginia has started hot but that doesnt mean theyll maintain them Jaden shot rings the bell his 44th three of the year hes had four double figure games against the conference including the 16 the other night where the hokes hit 41 but did hit 10 threes in the road win at Tallahassee shoot had that was a very impressive 16 the other night because he was under constant pressure mcel a front rim miss one and done go the Cavaliers tied at six and heres hammock Lew trying to beat Buchanan off the drive spins back into traffic hell push it up and draw the second on Buchanan and heres an early decision for Rod Sanchez regarding the second foul on the 611 sophomore as you mentioned Elijah Saunders not available today and so theyre going to rely heavily on Blake Buchan with those two fouls hes got come out and Robinsons going to come in for him yep so here is lell who is 67 at the line and the first one Music good and Andrew roie into the lineup at the real first true dead ball the junior transfer from Milwaukee who averages nine against the league and Dan told you that Anthony Robinson the 610 red shirt freshman from pach Tree City Georgia has also entered the fry l got his first points and the Hoke he back in front by two the is going to be a handful for Virginia because he can get the ball and drive it to the basket and youve got to get close to him because you have to respect that threepoint shooting ability he possesses Robinson this will be extended minutes for him now with the fouls against Buchanan and Saunders on the bench and theres a whistle and a foul and its going to be on shoot out on the perimeter itll be the first on the red shirt sophomore transfer from duke first on Virginia Tech here in the games nearly first four minutes well they had Kofi trapped its so hard when you have a guy trapped to avoid reaching in and thats what happened he reached in picked up the foul mcney trying to break free boy they put Hammond on him off the switch here is tane Murray who went crazy the other night at watsco center now road on the curl back inside Robinson draws the foul on potit and a couple to free throws on meijel potit first personal second on the hokes Virginia Tech by a basket the officials try to give coaches as much leeway as possible but good Heavens yeah you go all the way down to the opposite threepoint line thats going to be a technical foul so Jaden shoot is shooting the free Music throws so the hook led by a basket and shoot now has five and now were going to go back and pick it up at the point of interruption and that will be two shot shooting yep and the foul going to break was on meijel potit so here is young red shirt freshman Robinson who is 50 on the year he had two points and two rebounds at Miami the other night heres the first of two and its good Robinson a bit of an ACC Legacy his dad Tony Robinson was a terrific defensive tackle at Georgia Tech in the late 90s out of soberton Applause Georgia and Anthony has chosen the uh well sometimes similar amounts of contact right absolutely yeah I think what Ron Sanchez was upset about was not anything that happened with Robinson but that second foul call against Blake m round missed three by shoot and heres Kofi front court yanan with the fouls going to need Kofi and Robinson both and theres roie couldnt miss the chipping got blocked Maybe by Burnham on the play Ben Burnham is coming to the lineup senior transfer from Charleston who played for Pat Kelce a year ago Ro deflected the ball on the entry to lewow and Burnham traic you can tell Dan at least when you watch Virginia and Virginia Tech play when they get going a little too fast they only hurt themselves absolutely road that time but Virginia didnt mind running the ball down the court but if youre going to get down the court and take a quick shot youve got to take a good shot roie was underneath the basket being heavily defended by two players thats not the shot Virginias looking for and Brandon reick Steiner checks into the lineup to replace Hammond West both of these teams are trying to move up in the ACC but you got to remember this is Virginia and Virginia Tech this is an important game not only to these players but to a lot of people in this state heres Murray back perod and obviously the hookies are really pushing out trying to defend that three MCN thought about it Burnham switches off with 10 to shoot quickly in the corner Murray lines it up cant hit it Robinson had it and a foul on Burnham Anthony Robinson actually they got re no they got re Steiner beg you part sophomore from Acworth Georgia his first three now on the hokes and Tyler Johnsons out and in to the lineup comes Jaden young who played well the other night as along with the rest of his teammates at Tallahassee he really helped him he made three threes in that first half and now were going to get another foul thats on Rex Steiner too Rex Steiners piling him up well hes trying to keep mcne from getting the ball theyre trying to stay as close to mcne as they possibly can and you can understand that but you have to do it without fouling first hokey with two is Rex Steiner TJ power has come into the ball game so both the former Duke players are on the floor for their respective schools shoot for Virginia Tech and power of course for the Cavaliers tend to shoot for roie bounce pass heres Robinson strong to the basket couldnt finish power collects kick for Murray and a three got it Tate Murray puts the Cavaliers back in front those are the kind of baskets Virginia techers really they really dont want want to give them up that kick out off off an offensive rebound for a three is hard to defend and Jaden shoot has eight to lead Virginia Tech including a pair of Threes W he just looks so confident out there today amazing whats happened with him in the last month and in particular the last couple of weeks Dan his last three games he started averaging nine a game heres mcney Fall Away to TI got it why it mcne with four hes got a few pounds and a couple inches on red Steiner unless youre going to come and help out mcne is going to be able to get that shot anytime he wants three ties five lead changes here in the first 6 and 12 minutes shoot on the drive against mcney Little Fall Away good wow Jaden shoot piling him up you have to say hes feeling it right hes already got hes already got 10 hes got his fifth double figure game against the conference well Wes I said on Wednesday he had a really impressive game against Florida State and hes just picking up B Neely cant hit power the rebound tried to force it back up skips out for Murray and a fresh 20 for the Cavaliers in the corner Murray a shot fake on young hell drive to the basket couldnt finish it Robinson cleaning it up in front of wesler and a hell ball is going to be called between Patrick wesler and Anthony Robinson itll be awarded I leave to the Hokies and it will crowd doesnt like it they wanted wesler ticketed for the foul DayDay Ames comes back for Virginia and for the first time we get to see the Ontario freshman isan Sharma who checks in averaging six points against the league W Wes the question you got to ask yourself is where does Virginia get it offense with this lineup in the game heres wesler for shoot whos been hot early for Mike young now to wesler back for shoot on the drive against roie T to shoot for re Steiner wrap around for wesler and a foul will be called on Anthony Robinson from behind but West he did reach around from behind and thats an automatic for the officials you know if youre behind the guy inside and he catches the ball you just stay between him and the basket if you reach around youre asking for a Applause foul out front heres shoot tend to shoot Rex Steiner thought about it boy look at Robinson help on the screen Burnham hard drive into traffic against Power fell off the rim westro recovers back up again score Patrick wesler on the board to push the hes in front four again Wes you have a drive to the basket the defense comes to defend nobodys available for the defensive rebound thats twice now the hokes have been able to score off the offensive boards heres Ames back for roie into traffic back for power out of the corner rimd off Robinson lost rebound battle to wesler Stein are going to gear down here maybe yeah if powers going to help the team West hes got to make threes and he had a wide open one there youre not going to make them all but you got to make it high percentage shot lockt it off his foot thatll get us to a timeout 112 minutes to go in the opening 20 here at Charlottesville Virginia worth saying that Saunders is not playing for Virginia and Blake Buchanan got two fouls really early yep sure did picked him up inside the first four minutes so youre seeing a lot of Kofi TJ power Anthony Robinson MCs got isan Sharma now with the ball Baseline and hell knock down the Baseline jumper freshman from Milton Ontario in Canada has averaged almost six in the last three for Ron Sanchez and you can see the way the hokes are pushing out on these threepoint Shooters if the Virginia guys want to put it on the floor and take a twopoint jump shot the Hokies can live with that lewow strong inside first field goal for Toby L wow and he draws the foul on power itll be the first on power its the fifth on Virginia and here goes Lew to the line hes already got four and a chance for five it does such a nice job Wes hes stronger than you think that is a great pivot in there thats impossible for TJ power to guard without some help and the help did not come quickly but its hard to double team a guy at the free throw line hes one of four players to be in the top 20 both scoring and rebounding an ACC play the other three are maliku and a Florida State Maxim Reno of Stanford and Cooper flag its a pretty good list hes got five here early and the Hokey lead is five 159th meeting between the Cavaliers and the hokes today in Charlottesville heres Sharma with eight to shoot now Kofi The Freshman from the Pacific Northwest mcel a fallway three and lewow the backside rebound that was not a good pass mcney had to track it down and because it was late in the shot clock he had to fire it up Hammond against ases and Rodney Brown has checked into the lineup transfer from Cal potit with tend to shoot rolls on Kofi Buchanan is back back on the floor with the two fouls he grabs the rebound I think that tells you how important Ron Sanchez thinks this particular segment of the game is going to be AES foul line for kofis high arching too and this has been the Cavalier problem at points this year they just they go cold yep and if this is that I mean theyre still a pretty good defensive team but if they cant score theyre in trouble cuz their defense is not as Elite as it once was chairman split the front of the pack line goes to potit who missed the layup and hes going to draw the foul and thats the third on Buchanan with n and 1 half to go Blake Buchanan has to go to the bench now for the remainder of the half and again as Dan pointed out a lot of this is the runoff of the injury to Elijah Saunders see now Buchanan has to understand Wes that hes got the two fouls you dont try to block that shot but again buan and doesnt have a lot of experience but in particularly probably does have a lot of experience playing with two fouls this early in the game but you simply cannot go after that Applause shot Pos first one is good and theres Elijah Saunders right there in the dark sweatsuit with the boot on the left foot and of course sitting over there is not just five and a half rebounds a game that leads Virginia the 12 points are second on the team yeah hes the second leading score and thats that really presents some problems but the the issue now is Virginia has gone a stretch here since theyve scored and you cannot go in into a game like this and have these scoring drivs sixpoint difference long skip for RO working on Rodney Brown had it knocked away and brown going to be ticketed Rodney Brown whos from Paris California played last year for the Golden Bears of Mark Matson and their spin through the Pack 12 transferred to Virginia Tech as the crow flies Dan hes 2300 miles from where he played his high school basketball but I got word this morning his parents have relocated to Arkansas so Brown a little closer in terms of getting the mom and dad well a little closer West obviously Arkansass closer than California but still removed from blackburg leow who by the way was called for the foul a moment ago not brown and he turns it over on the dribble against Kofi see if Virginia can build momentum mcney squares for a three seven for Isaac mcne Virginia second three in eight tries Virginia Tech has defended those screens very well but that was in transition and nobodys organized here goes Hammond kick into the corner three ball from Young bounced around and Kofi rebounds Brown will pick up mcney quickly left side Sharma for the top again West surprisingly the Cavaliers playing effectively in transition they got all that going before the hokes could set the defense locked up at 21 six in a row for Virginia Hokies have gone about three minutes since their last field goal brown with six to shoot lines up Roadie now heres young shot clock winding down and Jaden young buries a three you know Ro was late coming on that switch Wes and with the shot clock running down you got to get out there fast back to a threepoint Advantage for Virginia Tech mcney thought about it slips it inside and Kofi lost it but a foul called on Ben Hammond thats going to get us to break Hammonds first its the sixth on the hokes Cavaliers will have the ball back now were throwing threes in from all over the place game Virginia Tech in their last five games theyve averaged nine made threes a game inside copi almost lost it on the dribble tried to make the save burn him original Dig Down forc the loose ball and now the hokes with just Virginias second turnover four total here in the first nearly 13 minutes of play Hammond and an offensive foul on Burnham illegal screen Sean Hull going to call the foul Toby okay so Toby Ls going to come out on his second foul with 703 to play lot of whistles in this game Wes but you would expect that in a rivalry type game like this one Applause yep shoot has come back on the floor for Mike Young Who became the third active coach in the ACC to win 400 career games the other day joining of course Leonard Hamilton and Brad Brownell on that list stand a very impressive accomplishment for Mike young yep that teric job in blackburg hes done a terrific job everywhere hes been absolutely tend to shoot Ro a lot of dribbling into traffic on Johnson out of the corner KOB a three the Virginia Tech defense West if they can make Virginia dribblers then thats their success Virginia they theyre not a team that creates a lot off the dribble they got a pass and move Burnham away to Hammond on the drive Burnham B GED by Kofi recovered roie lead for Murray all the way to the baset T Murr with five well thats a couple times now Virginia has gotten out to run I think surprising the Hokies a little bit Hammond all the way through partially blocked under six to play first half Murray gave him a spark the other night in the start at Miami trying to do with a transition bucket here out of the corner Sharma left it Applause short 540 to play first Applause half Hammond into the front Applause Court skip inside potit nice catch and Score migs first field goal hes got three Virginia Tech is also a team West that relies on a lot of movement off the ball and thats exactly what happened that time Virginias defense got caught up in Applause traffic Kofi at the foul on extended bounced around 5 minutes to go first half threepoint lead Virginia Tech in the basketball and with all the pressure Virginia Tech is trying to keep on Isaac mcney if kofis going to get open looks like that hes going to have to make them y mcney has three field goals in six tries and theres potit sing Baseline so back to back field goals now for Virginia Tech from Migel potit and on backto back plays kofis lost potit and Pos a pretty big guy you dont want to lose him that close to the basket fivepoint Advantage now mcne actually posting Hammond tend to shoot Fall Away Isaac mcney good wow nine for mcney Cavaliers leading score he and Mur have 14 of their 25 here in the first half thats the third time in this game that McNeely has taken advantage of that mismatch threepoint lead for Virginia Tech heres sh who was hot early Kofi took it from him saved it to Murray hes got Roy with him the catch and the flip wont fall shoot the rebound it was a tough catch for RO and a tougher shot well he made the catch Wes and what you have to do on that play is dribble it out just cuz youre down there doesnt mean you have to shoot it double team quickly to Applause potit crosscourt for Tyler Johnson hell skip it back into the corner three ball Burnham is good Ben Burnhams 23rd three of the year and a Virginia timeout with 326 to play in Chestnut Hill is not an adequate description bananas yeah I mean whatever crazy to the third power is unbelievable right yeah way do you see just how all this happened 72 Run for the hokes largest lead of the half for Mike Youngs Club Sharma Off the Bench drops another three that is eight for isan Sharma he hit 10 against SMU three of his last nine from three coming into the ball game Dan and all of a sudden hes two for three and three for four here and with the foul trouble and injury problems Virginia has that play off the bench has been extremely important but that guy they really ought to consider guarding him Jaden shoot now with 11 hes got 13 in the first half total four of six on the floor including three threes the lead back to six heres mcney whos had a hard time finding room from behind the line yeah but hes done a nice job getting it inside look at wesler try to help heres Murr a three got him and the other thing that MC has done a really good job is pass the ball 31 34 threepoint separation coming up on two to go here in the first half at Charlottesville its been a really well played first half shoot into the corner burnam step back is that a 3 no yes it was wesler going to be called for the foul trying to battle Robinson for the rebound I believe I think we got a one andone coming up here yep Patrick wesler 7 foot red shirt sophomore from outside of Charlotte thats his first and the eighth on Virginia Tech dont forget more basketball coming up on acc Network J alter Randolph children standing by Moody Coliseum tonight Maxim Reno and the Cardinal Dan are in Dallas to C SMU 600 start time following our coverage here from Charlottesville Robinson front end of the one and one no good Anthony now two of three at the line for his only points of the half still a threepoint hokey lead if you havent seen Max REO and were going to get a foul called and thats on Robinson it is on Robinson and now hes got two and thats seven on Virginia with 147 to go so free throws coming up from Mel potita one and one and replay on the video board here at John Paul Jones Arena met with some scrutiny from the partisans heres another look and oh boy oh boy potit Robinson call for the foul well thats a hard way to get a foul I mean he got called for the foul West cuz he was the previous play is under review but what theyre going to review here is whether that is a flagrant foul on potit yeah so that elbow came up and got uh Robinson in the face or not Bill Covington Sean Hall will administrate the replay and a threepoint lead for Virginia Tech so remember call on the floor was the second foul against reder freshman Anthony Robinson with 147 to go it is also the seventh so it would be it would be a one andone opportunity for potit okay Dan walk me through what you see here well these guys are struggling for position inside and I think the foul is called right there because he you know hes grabbing on and then the elbow comes and gets him in the face and so what you can have Wes is the foul on right there is the foul on Robinson and then the elbow comes up and so you can have two fouls on this play you that elbow did come up and get him in the face yep so Michael kits has now joined Bill Covington for the review Shan Hull has already seen it theres a good bit of collaboration that occurs in this process and well see how they uh adjudicate it well West thats what they have to decide if that contact in there was excessive and or unnecessary nothing there okay all right so what theyve decided no upgrade to the common foul there we go so po will be one and one second foul on Robinson so the contact that occurred after the foul was just incidental you see Kyle guy national champion of course here at Virginia talking to Anthony Robinson as he goes to the bench with two so the Cavaliers bring a Ro mcne Murray and Kofi on the floor here for the final 147 and a very small lineup y potin free throw bounced in for it he is now two for three by in conference play hes a 78 free throw shooter so you have a big guy who can shoot free throws thats really a bonus at 25 and a win against Miami and blackburg earlier this year and hes got seven in the first half this is a very important last minute and 45 seconds of this half for Virginia you know theyve gone through some stretches where they havent been able to put the ball in the basket but theyve hung in the game Cavaliers with five threes in their 12 made field goals heres Murray against Burnham gets it to Kofi working in on potit and Jacob tried to to flip it up there and it never had a chance thats just thats just a bad shot West you power it up there and force the officials to decide whether its a block shot or a foul or you kick it back out 70 seconds to go here in Charlottesville first half heres Hammond on the drive now for Johnson and hell score Tyler Johnson The Freshman from morlando with his first basket W he is 6 five and very strong he just overpowered a 3831 biggest lead of the half now for Virginia Tech Cavaliers need a basket yep Kofi trying to help mcne with eight to shoot now Murray with five to shoot Tan on the hard drive follow away at the foul line air ball Johnson will save it to potit shot clock who is basically off about a second differential and Mike young out to tell his team what he wants on their last possession really good couple of defensive possessions in a row y by Virginia Tech some questionable shot selection by Virginia but really good defense by the Hokies Burnham trying to help Hammond berno out front for to shoot hell Drive Murray in right hand jump hook no good Murray The Rebound with one and thatll be that halim here in Charlottesville The hokes Who played really well defensively the other night tasse kind of tighten the screws a little bit here going to the locker room to get the seven two turnovers for the Cavaliers in fact and they havent been really hurt that bad on the board so a couple of their bugaboos theyve done pretty well they just havent shot the three very successful and away we go with half two Cavaliers Trail seven and the ball and the foul trouble for Virginia has hurt them as well Ro starts on the floor heres Kofi the catch and flush first points for Jacob Kofi you can see the attention McNeely draws West and again thats four assists now for mcney Kofi had a couple of good looks in the first half thats his first basket shoot l potit to catch against Robinson who starts this second half and a three for Tyler Johnson wow just the ninth triple of the year for Johnson who is his seventh in ACC play and just like that back to 8 it goes well Wes Johnson has been improving the entire season ases for roie another cut layup Kofi rejected potit itll stay with the Cavaliers and 11 to shoot a nice ball Movement by Virginia but Virginia Tech weve talked about their defense at the end of the first half Kofi did not catch that ball cleanly and a nice job of Po by potit to come over and help Ro for mcney tend to shoot needs a screen back for roie heres mcne up top working against Hammond got it to roie at the horn on the shot clock and it hit the rim again a really good defense by Virginia Applause Tech The Freshman from Northern Virginia Ben Hammond played on that very talented team at Paul the six tossed away on the turnover potit here goes d aims the scoop and score on that particular play you need to throw that ball up for a little while you dont throw him a bounce pass in there that allowed Ro to pick it off and Virginia theyve done a pretty nice job theyre now you know theyve now been credited with seven fast break points thats as much as they get in three games Hammond down for lewow turning against Kofi trying to find space and scores with a right hand seven for lewow on just his second field goal and the encouraging thing for Mike young and his staff has to be that they built that Advantage with their leading score only getting five first half points well L had some foul problems in the first half went out with two fouls heres mcne that is a three off the corner and bouns away so nice job by McNeely good movement to get open but not going to make them all but Virginia will take that shot shot but now they have to dig in defensively Wes theyre struggling on the offensive end you got to get some opportunities defensively shoot off the screen too strong with the three Robinson the Applause rebound now Applause Music mcneel roie works toward the Baseline all the way through and it rattle off for him copi will chase it down 20 on the reset for the Cavaliers Ro just got going a little too quickly there Wes I think he expected more pressure than he got mcney ases with five to shoot trying to take shoot on the drive fall away at the foul line he is good six for Day Day ases lot of work for two points thats exactly what Virginia Tech wants him to do is to work that hard for two points nice job Again by the hokes defense turning the Cavaliers into dribblers Hammond for shoot kick to Lew out of the corner the three bound it away he shoots 52 in conference play from out there roie love Robinson the flush catch that ball might have gone in anyway Roy flipped it up there and Anthony Robinson set it down with two hands how about that that was some play all of a sudden its a fourpoint Virginia Tech lead Balls got to go to the wall down for potit Kofi tried to help Robinson potit spins kick back lewow triple away and good held the form as he knocks down his third field goal hes now got 10 in the game and Virginia Tech back to a sevenpoint lead that really put the Cavalier defense in a bind you double team on the inside and that leaves L all alone ases working against LW Baseline Day Day Ames up and underscores terrific drive against the much taller Toby LW for DayDay Ames and Ames now he has something to say l i dont know that thats a good idea almost 5 minutes gone in this second half its a fivepoint Virginia Tech lead but the hokes and Wahoos are settling in leow will try another three too strong rebound mcne ahead for ases he will take it on ham and the Euro and one wow all of a sudden Darren Sylvester Ames Jr is feeling it home courts that they played at neutral sights and thank goodness they changed their minds on that because this game and of course theyre not going to do that now with Virginia Tech in the ACC but this is a game that has to be played on the hope court he talked today between Richmond and Rowan Oak right yes thats right heres Rex Steiner who was saddled with foul trouble in the first half hes back out there now for Mike young Jaden young has also returned hes got the basketball out front left open for three good boy Jaden young has stepped into two triples but they just left him now Virginia Tech West his eight for 15 from Beyond The Ark heres roie and the Cavaliers who had it a moment ago to a threepoint game got the free throw now Buchanan rolling with a right hand blade Buchanan second field goal and again he has played very few minutes in this game West less than five as a matter of fact back to a threepoint game again six minutes gone Burnham with young Rex Steiner potit and Jaden shoot for the hokes skipped to the corner for Burnham three over bu Cannon is good Ben Burnham has six now on a pair of Threes the hokes with some great ball movement West and great decisions on these passes to get wideopen threes ases heres McNeely working out front against Rex Steiner its been tough for Isaac mcney today to find clean looks from behind the threepoint line on the drive ases Fall Away on shoot from the foul line seven minutes gone its still a sixpoint Virginia Tech lead and Virginias got to get some defensive stops Wes that the Virginia Tech offense is operating on all cylinders right now Rex Steiner oh my long three Brandon rexin he was almost in Mike Youngs lap now that was a long three West but Virginia the defender just ran away from him again and you cant do that time out Baron Sanchez and the Cavaliers ninepoint Advantage theyre knocking down threes you see they are 10 of 17 today 36 for the regular season theyre a little better than that in League Play slightly under 40 are the hes in just ACC games all of a sudden ninepoint lead largest of the day mnelia triple got it nice answer by the Cavaliers out of the timeout really good movement of both the ball and McNeely to get him open thats as open a look as hes had in this game now the question for the Cavaliers is can they stop the hokes yeah heres Burnham on the drive from the wing right hand turn got the roll see then Burnhams been handy he sure has youre not going to come back in a game Wes unless you can get some stops and Virginia Tech defense has been good enough today theyve gotten enough stopped because their offense is firing on all cylinders Ro handles the ball Now mnelia Catch and shoot again hes fouled by Rex Steiner thats three shots Mike young wanted a kick out foul on mcne not going to get it timeout in Music Charlottesville or hit him on the hand yep so no added value to any of this mcney to the line for three free throws and the first one good four in the half 13 in the game for the Junior from Poco West Virginia W Wes at this point I would have to say that Virginias problems in this game have not been offensive although mcneel misses that free throw Virginia simply cannot stop Virginia Tech the Hokes getting whatever they want chance to cut it down to a half dozen here and got the back end of the three in the second half Virginia Tech is shooting 7 for 10 overall and 5 for eight from Beyond The Arc and for those of you who are doing math thats 70 and 625 youre not going to win very many games if your defense is giving up percentages like that shoot and Bill Covington off the ball its on Anthony Robinson his third first of the half on the Cavaliers so 20 to shoot and Baseline for Hammond who plays with wesler Burnham shoot and Jaden young and theres Burnham trying to add to his total can and that got knocked away heres a second chance now for the Hokies Music again actually a third try if you want to figure on the foul too right thats only the third offensive re Bound in the game for Virginia Tech seven to shoot for young Murray out there young over the top of T Murray missed everything feast or famine for Jaden young today a pair of Threes And now an airball that will be earn him a serenade from the Virginia faithful theyre up by six I think he can deal with a serenade back door for Robinson they get that played down dont they they do really a nice back screen and you throw it up there he can go get it fourpoint lead for Virginia Tech Anthony Robinson now with six in the game Hammond for shot Robinson trying to help heres sh over the top of roie for three and that I mean that was not bad defense but those are the kind of shots that shoot made in that Florida State game when they needed a basket he was always there with a long three Jaden shs got 16 one off his season in career high he had 17 against Mark prer winr team early in the campaign this year for the hokes won every time the Cavaliers look like theyre crawling back in Virginia Tech has had a response Ria three got him first points of the game for Andrew roie and remember Wes hes coming off an injury and they didnt know whether hed be able to play today or not so hes toughing it out fourpoint lead for Virginia Tech inside a 10 to go here in Charlottesville Burnham got around Buchanan wesler couldnt follow and a whistle and foul on Robinson thats his fourth foul with 951 to go now remember Elijah Saunders is on the bench and not available today for the Cavaliers so Rod Sanchez has a decision to make stay with Robinson go get Kofi maybe TJ power who knows wesler hits the first dont forget ACC gymnastics comes up tomorrow afternoon number eight Cal squares off against 21st ranked NC State at Reynolds Coliseum coverage starts at 4 Eastern one Pacific on acc Network and of course on the ESPN app second free throw of the two for Patrick wesler Robinson comes out Virginia just violated doesnt matter though wesler makes the free throw so its four on four points for wesler Wes a guy who has been a thorn in the Cavaliers side particularly in this second half has been Burnham you know Burnham he hes the one that got wesler to the free throw line with that drive to the basket hes knocked down a couple of Threes hes been outstanding vernham has got seven or eight rather in the game on three field goals heres roie Buchanan now against lewow and look at this Baseline sneak and out of bounds with Day Day Ames boy how many times do you see that you see it at least once it seemed like every game every single game yep well I think actually McNeely surprised Dames with that pass I think they were trying to throw it to McNeely but he was off balance when he caught it and he was trying to drop it off often AES was out of bounds third turnover on Virginia sixpoint lead for the hokes well Virginia Techs been redot 57 from the floor Cavaliers are better than that almost 67 theres Hammond he left that short and now a foul to be called on ases but you got to be careful here and I again this is a very important emotional kind of game but you dont want to damage your chances by getting a technical free throw Ham Will go to the line technical foul excuse me couple of free throws for the Freshman from Fairfax all Metropolitan in DC part of that crazy team at Paul the 6 that just steamrolled for the State title last year heres another look got him on the elbow and now Hammond trying to hit the back end free throw good no bacon here in the building and now again Wes were in a situation here where its almost feels like a must score opportunity for Virginia yanon foul off the ball on Tyler Johnson first on the Freshman from Orlando third on Virginia Tech and thats a foul thats created by Andrew roie doing a great job moving without the ball you he just hit that three so youre very conscious of trying to stay with him say Ros been a little cleaner here in the second half than he was in the opening 20 minutes too Dan nine minutes to go in the game sevenpoint lead aims the three ball back R Miss mcney tried to keep it deflect it out heres young against roie and a foul roie will sacrifice his first personal fourth on Virginia as to not give Jadon young a free run at the rack here and trailing seven is Virginia well that ball really bounced out thats a tough break for Virginia but young makes some pay for it by grabbing it and taking it all the way to the goal so Jon Young on the year 79 and the first one is good dont forget when the day is done in the ACC following Stanford at SMU Taylor tanom with Carlos Boozer Joel Barry and Luke Hancock nothing but presented by T price tonight follows coverage from Moody Coliseum in Dallas all the highlights interviews and more and young missed the second so a sevenpoint afternoon for Jaden young the lead is eight for the hookes inside nine to go at John Paul Jones Arena terrific crowd looking on and why wouldnt it be here the Rivalry game in the Commonwealth with Virginia and Virginia Tech isan Sharm had a nice first half look at that three back rim Miss slapped out by Murray bodies go to the floor here and Jaden young going to wait on his buddies Hammond and Johnson took a heck of a spill well they really did right in front of us yep glad theyre okay in the corner is Johnson heres L whos been quiet offensively Burnham sneaks Baseline all the way through blocked by Murray Cavaliers with Murray mcney Trails three over Hammond front rim Miss boy thats the hookies dodged the bullet right there Wes said you get McNeely that wide open in transition thats almost Applause money Hammond looking for a crease oh what a pass and wow fouled by Ames as he went to the basket terrific pass but free throws for the hes with an eightpoint lead when we continue threw it away come on Beth come on by the way lewow made the first free throw can I just say that the picture with Terry in the mustache is an alltimer wow we did things differently in the 70s Toby lewow misses the back end so its a ninepoint game still here is shoot for oh quick look into low working against Buchanan in the dunk W laow was not paying any attention and hes lucky he didnt get hit in the forehead with that ball y but he I mean what great reaction hes able to catch it and Virginia Tech has seized complete control of this game yep Toby Le adds another one to it and all of a sudden the hokes are building some momentum here largest lead of the game at 11 Applause inside Buchanan threw it away to Rex Steiner trying to go to ases in the corner under seven to play Virginia techs here theyve lost three of their last four split their last six theyre nine and 12 in the overall total four six in the ACC two of those wins are Road Applause Music wins and theyre on a 103 run well this is a Virginia Tech Team West that has struggled at times but they finally seem to be playing well you know playing up to their potential and again their defense against Florida state was really good and their defense today has been good enough but they have been dominant offensively career high 18 for Jaden shoot on his six field goal Virginia the ball out of the timeout Cavaliers will have one to go in the final 621 Virginia 21st scoring drought of the year of 3 and 12 minutes or more here theyre trying to find a way out of it roie Baseline blocked off the glass by lall and a foul against Toby low his third again Virginia Tech is doing such a great job defending out at the threepoint line and roie know he had an opportunity went by yep but another thing this is Virginia they are five for seven from the free throw line Virginia Tech has made 14 free throws so thats another area where the hokeys in by attacking inside have really created some problems and theyre going to look here I think this has to do with the block by Lew before the foul was called Dan is this a potential goal tend well they had to call it goal tending to be able to review it West okay and I did not see a goal tending call so Bill Covington will tell us in a moment what theyre reviewing here I think theyre looking for an theres an elbow thrown in there Sean Hulls going to come over and visit with Dan tell Applause him all right so theyre looking to make sure that there wasnt any extracurricular activities just before that block shot it okay so Baseline we go Oh look The block the is not goal tending we can see that I think right yeah well I again Wes unless they call it goal tending they cant go and review it I dont know that I saw anything at on those two angles that would well bet it was before that West and somebody got tangled up and I dont know exactly where and until the officials tell us you know Sean Hall is very gracious of him he came over and said were looking to see if there was anything to happened before that play and they decided there wasnt right so now the foul on Lew will be his third fourth of the half against the hokes and Andrew Roy the Junior from Milwaukee who transferred from St Thomas of Minnesota well go to the line here to shoot a couple first free throws for roie whos 79 on the Year this will just be his 29th attempt by the way Virginia is not not a team that shoots very many free throws West Music yeah and thats not a this year thing either no no no no no thats not anything with this team right in fact this year the Cavaliers are number 348 in free throw attempts per game yeah just 16 a game so Rex Steiner front Court 11point lead for Virginia Tech and this is the point of the Cavaliers defense is going to come through its got to start now and theres again lall puts so much pressure on you Wes you got to get to him because he can make a three and then hes quick enough to go right by foul will be on Kofi The Freshman from Seattle sixth on Virginia Tech or Virginia rather and B line out of bounds for Mike young te Music heres lewow Jaden shs working on a career high today heres Toby Lew digging in Up and Under with a right hand and the rebound for Burnham theres that guy again Burnhams done a little bit of everything second half been a little different than the first in that reflection as well inste a couple threes has eight points today and the lob from RE Steiner he overthrew Toby L I want to tell you thats like overthrowing a NASA space shot I I didnt know it was possible to throw the ball over the head of Toby Ls got a 49 12 in vertical and stands 68 from London England ases out front mcney there goes tame Murray and a reach on shoot will be his second thats the fifth on Virginia Tech Wes again you dont like that foul necessarily but what you do like if you are the Virginia Tech coaching staff is the fact that your guys are getting out there and running Virginia off the threepoint line low out Mel potit in and Cavaliers here are going to need points no field goals last 5 minutes Kofi tried to break that out of a double team hes fouled on the way Applause up and Ben Burnham draws his first 16 foul on Mike Youngs team so thatll send Jacob Kofi an 80 free throw shooter to the line ahead of five minutes to go in an 11point deficit first one good dont forget Mark packer Applause has you covered weekdays at 400 ACC PM right here on acc Network tell brother Fuller hello Force 10point lead for the hokes Hammond back in the game for Mike young as Kofi hits him both I dont know that the Cavaliers can stand many empty possessions down down nine here well they cant West but also theyve got to get stops and thats what theyve had a tough time doing y get another steady Effort Virginia Tech here today defensively so far Hammond with 10 to shoot Kopi there Johnson tried to slash in turned over copi the recovery here goes Murray front court all the way in lay up good for Tan Murray hes in double figures sevenpoint game game with four and a half to go maybe this one isnt over yet West six straight by the Cavaliers in the last minute and a half on the drive slapped out recovered by shoot with 10 to shoot he will and it spins out Johnson had it and commits the foul going over MCs back the battle inside boy give Isaac mcney a little bit of credit at 64 he was really really having to work to keep Tyler Johnson from it and he made him foul to make sure that it was whistled and now Virginia gets another crack at it on a one and one well the most important thing that McNeely did is he got in between Johnson and the basket West in other words he blocked him out y forced Johnson to come over his back and now these are two very big free throws MCN in conference play coming into the game was 88 he hes missed one today and Mike kits has gone to the table just making sure that its the 17 foul so its one and one yep glad to know our bookkeeping matches the table and free throw from McNeely good of course when Ive got got the proud of Centerville Virginia Rick Simmons here Im usually 100 accurate or close to Applause it chance to cut it to five here and it bounced out usually a fairly Sure Shot Isaac mcneels missed two of five today seven nothing run though for the Cavaliers who were within a half dozen o petite now for Hammond against ases tend to shoot heres Johnson going to find L wall here he is hands to Hammond into traffic now shoot clock winding down he will fire at the horn and it bounds away they scramble inside the Cavaliers have it Virginia Techs now gone scoreless from the floor in the last three minutes now we talked about Virginias defense needing to step up and make a statement and they have done it now can the Cavaliers answer on this in heres Kofi hands to ases six to shoot ases all the way through out of the corner roie long rebound Kopi a second chance for him aims a standing three nope front rim missed Johnson will let it bounce out of bounds itll belong to Virginia Tech but a timeout in Charlottesville hoks lead by six with 302 to go to make up the difference you know their defense is really dug in but you know this is a hokey team that has shot the ball very well most of the day y heres Hammond Jaden Young on the floor by the way lewow being defended by Kofi whos only got a single foul here in the second half I think L has to handle it inside Hammond out front tend to shoot theyre trying to get it to L theres a mismatch with ases theyll allow him to turn hell score thats one where kofis got to down and double team hard because the guy hes guarding is Hammond and Hammond is a very poor threepoint shooter really good job by Virginia Tech to get a mismatch with wall inside heres Kofi for McNeely its an eightpoint game and the Cavaliers cant wait around roie out of the corner good eight all in a half for Andrew roie and I think if youre Virginia Tech theres no reason why you dont try to get the wall down inside again right there theres the mismatch burnam in the corner and again heres Lew with ases Kofi tried to help Toby La through traffic in Applause one what a second half this is turning out to be for the Junior from London well Wes once again they get him isolated down inside this time Kofi comes hard but law does a great job turning and Kofi steps away from the double team and that allows Lew the distance to get to the basket excuse me the space to get to the basket so Toby laow in his last five games averaging 15 points 10 rebounds hes got 17 with three rebounds today remember he spent a lot of first half time on the bench with foul trouble he missed on the threepoint opportunity but nonetheless the lead is seven and here goes Ro streaking to the basket hell lay it up and Applause in so 10point half and ball game for Andrew roie but its a fivepoint game with 90 seconds to go and remember this is a Virginia team that doesnt force a lot of turnovers Here We Go Again Hamet on the drive into traffic back for burnner tend to shoot Jaden shoots got a career high today Hammond working through Runner good what a huge basket from a scoring perspective one of the least likely guys has pushed a career high 18 here to lead the hokes he and Toby lewow the only double figure scores for Virginia Tech as we work on the final minute of play and the Cavaliers have to go quickly Ro way out front skips it back for mcne thats a foul on Hammond one and one for Isaac mcne on the third against Ben Hammond well theyre trying to get him open Wes and theyre fortunate to get the foul there that was a bad pass so McNeely will go to the line where he is three for five today Virginia Tech has become the fourth team to score 70 or more in inside this building the fourth Virginia opponent in the last 66 games they joined pit along with Louisville and not Dame thats three this year Dan and thats two in a row not Dame was their last home game thats right mcne knocks the first one down Isaac with another one so its a fivepoint game with a minute to go you foul quick here Dan I dont think so Wes I think you try to get the try to get the steal you dont mind if you foul right there Brody did on young the problem is Young is a pretty good free throw shootter yep 79 but if youre going to start to fou this early Wes then what you have to do is you have to trade three for two so even if he makes two here you got to get down and you got to get a three I dont think that you can catch up in the game you cant obviously cant trade two for two right so heres young to the line its a one inone opportunity on the eighth Virginia you foul Jaden who had three in the first half hes got four here in the second half missed the free throw Miss has happen badly yep Ro front Court working on shoot under a minute to go cant be dribbling a lot here got to get something up on the rack and he does threepoint game with 42 seconds left and a backourt foul on Ames his fourth with 422 to go well another look at Andrew roie Well Ro feels like he has a mismatch inside nobody comes to double team roie continues with his fine offensive play here in the second half young will come out of the game as Hammond goes to the line hes two for three at the line this is the last oneonone opportunity a third of the games in the series roughly have been decided by five or less and the free throw is missed Burnham got the rebound but he went over the back Sean Hull has called the foul and Virginias going to shoot free throws at the other end on Ls fourth foul and I think that its going to be Buchanan at the free throw line yes it is the while going over his back well the hokes now westes they were in control of this game but theyve missed the front end of the last two one andone opportunities right Virginia Tech who started this day 13 of 15 at the line is just one of their last six and heres Buchanon who is 26 of 47 at the line this year 55 on a one and one and a chance to pull this thing to Applause Music one and wow went way above the basket to get the rebound Cavaliers probably need to find a way to you got to foul yeah exactly and heres Hammond back to Rex Steiner whos attempted just 12 free throws on the year Rex Steiner eyes Buchanan now heres shoot 10 seconds to go lewow turning on Buchanan looking for help with five hell scoop with a right hand Buchanan kept it alive theres Murray 12 seconds left roie front Court Virginia calls a timeout with 87 left down three my goodness well send you to Jay alter and Randolph chers soon as were done Ro will put it in play skips it across this is AES the catch here is McNeely and he is fouled before the shot says mike kits now the Virginia bench doesnt like it its on Jaden shoot its the third on shoot its the 10th team foul B the hes I think this is a really good foul because McNeely is in position where he has a chance to oh my Music Two Shots is the call you know the officials ruled that he was not in his shooting motion and so mcne will shoot two free throws and a chance to pull the Cavaliers to within one Ron Sanchez out of timeouts first one Applause Music good low returns for potit now 64 left I dont think this is a situation where you miss intentionally Wes relatively speaking you could make it quick foul right yes cuz Virginia Techs going to shoot two on any common Music foul Cavaliers still within one now if you dont get a steal you foul right away it doesnt matter who you foul and they want to get the ball to shoot Cavaliers do not guard the inbounds theres MC potit is fouled immediately by Murray first on tan Murray malija potit today at the free throw line is three for four now we mentioned before Wes he is a pretty good free throw shooter so youre comfortable with having him at the line even if he makes both though Virginias going to get a crack at this yes they are but youre going to have the same situation and I dont think that Virginia Tech is going to allow Virginia to get off of three but the key here is if he misses you got to block out two shots for potit first one is no good all right now all bets are off they if you the Cavaliers youve got a block out Mike young wants to sub burn him in if he makes it he doesnt here is RO 4 seconds three two roie to the basket off the rim and the Hokies survive
