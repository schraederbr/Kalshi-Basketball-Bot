Our officials Bert Smith Tony Padilla and Ryan Casano A really good crew for this Monday night before Thanksgiving Happy Thanksgiving to you and yours Mustangs start with the ball A 6 and0 record And Miller swings it out Geron Pierre loss it out of the corner and knocks down a dribble Pierre his 11th three this season The starting lineup for Radford Mari Jordan Dale Jones Dennis Parker Jr Tyson Brown and Lucas Walls Walls getting his second straight start after coming off the bench early this season Sam Evatu cheering able to pull down the rebound after the Dell Jones miss Thats what you want from the Mustangs Another one from Der Pierre Missed this time but the first one was a make SMU not afraid to go early offense if they get a good look like Cory Washington does And SMU is two of three from deep the last few games Theyve loved this lineup BJ Edwards Booby Miller Cory Washington Sam Yolu and Geron Pierre Jr They can all score Thats right Now they have a good first five that go out to the court play efficient play together and play defensively Thats what you want All averaging at least 12 points a game From out front Dennis Parker Jr from the free throw line Rises but cant hit Good defense by Cory Washington And SMU tries to grow the early lead Booby Miller sitting on 1499 but looking to distribute early One of the leading assist makers in the country Miller pitches Edwards fires Just off the mark for BJ Edwards Jr coming off the sixth triple double in SMU history Points assists and steals Its loose and Edwards comes out with the steel He had 10 of those was a new SMU record last Friday A little bit of concern meanwhile for Mari Jordan as he goes down Well look at him as we get to the keys to the game Yes indeed The keys in the game for Radford Fluidity music on offense Number one they want to make sure that theyre moving the ball and finding the the paint touches And then next controlling the possession whether thats music on offense or defense Offensively they have a great opportunity to score And on defense they have a great job opportunity to stop the Mustangs for the must SMU number one is to defend transitions and then lastly to take great shots and you want points in the paint and thats what SMU has been fantastic at this season 43 points in the paint per game this season although that one gets denied Good active hands by Tyson Brown to dislodge it from Yatollu Drive by Walls Didnt score his last time That dumps it inside and Brown is rejected by Yigatollu going up Thats a great block by Yiglu and hes trying to get fed on the other end Misses though Backtoback turnovers for the SMU Mustangs See Yiglu secondyear sophomore out of Turkey averaging 12 and seven Yes Block on Igotu Great ball great hands finds it and get it out in transition Tyson Brown a guy thats shooting 70 early this year All his touches and all his shots will come from inside that restricted area nearly All nearly comes away from Rinsby Jr whos in for the first time but its out front Threepointer by Dennis Parker Jr Rims out 0 for four start for Bradford Loopy Miller shows his back Drives in looking to kiss it home Cant do it but hes made his living at the line this season And hes back there again Wonderful job by Booby Miller being strong and aggressive and drawing the foul Love it Boopy Love it Dell Jones whistled for his first team foul number one or two I should say on Radford So Poopy Miller 90 at the line this season for 1500 There goes 1500 Got that out of the way nice and early But Boopy Miller 10th in the nation in free throw makes this season and leads the ACC in free throw makes and free throw attempts What helps him get to the line so often Uh hes just crafty Hes hes a smaller guard that knows where hes going And the high IQ that he has as a basketball player puts him in those positions and he makes the shots And not only leading the team in scoring but also one of the ACC leaders in assists as well at 7 and a half per game SMU surges that early advantage to 8 nothing Radford on this end One turnover four miss shots Their head coach is Zack Chu formerly under Andy Enfield last year right here at SMU A chance for a homecoming of sorts Hes from Dallas as well Jaylen Johnson gets hounded by Miller Eventually it ends up in Erikson out front and he knocks down the open three The freshman from Denmark can stretch the floor Way to stay poised by Rafford to get that ball out of the corner and get it back up top for a three by as a team Rafford out of his nearly eight triples per game Yukatan turns away out to the corner Washington down to the short corner and as he rips into the air a reachin foul is called against Brennan Riggsby Jr So heres Zach Chu two and five on the young season for the Radford Highlanders A Dallas music native a young guy was a walkon to Richmond back in the day to get his uh playing career started and hes been an assistant under a lot of bigtime coaches not only Andy Enfield he got Doc Rivers in the NBA and Rick Carile in the NBA as well And they all love what Zach Chu has brought to the table Coach Chu does a great job with the Radford Highlanders uh in his first year uh pushing him to be great They have a great opportunity tonight against the Mustangs One of the things they want to do is on offense you know be unpredictable You dont want to be able to figure out what theyre going to do next Threepointer doesnt go Mustangs getting it out DJ attacking and Edwards steals a mouse in the house Tries to take it inside Igatou in between a double nearly a triple T and misses inside Just off a little bit by Tollu A way to keep it high Highlanders trying to claw back in down nine to three cleaning his way down low Parker Jr doesnt go but Cory Washington is willing to rebound with anybody in the country That is right Cory Washington does a great job rebounding from his position and the size Another turnover for SMU Its their third of the game Just one so far for Radford Ericson who had the three for the Highlanders gives it up Dennis Barker Jr the usage rate around 30 picked up by Igolu Short corner jumper rims out PJ Edwards brson it himself Hes averaging six assists per game Theres Igolu doubled out to Washington Flies baseline and hes going to the rack and the line on the other side Good start for the SMU music Mustangs though theyre without a field goal in the Andre youve been in that situation at the pro level at that GLeague level where you know its basically its music just NBA life right So um you know whats the difference between uh some you know offensive systems you might see in the college game thats more controlled and and what normally you see in the NBA Yeah I would say one of the biggest things is is obviously space and and and rules and regulations You cant sit in the paint uh in the NBA So you have to have different actions where you can play off of that Absolutely And so these are both coaches that want to be sudden They want to play fast They want to play random as well where the opponent doesnt know what theyre going to do next And a little late hedge and Jaylen Johnson is just a little too quick for that Johnson was the OBC newcomer of the year last year for Tennessee Tech and uh brought in to help run the point for music Ratford this season Yes Jaylen Johnson is a crafty guard Fast quick can get downhill Uh but its just about him finding his space finding his feel uh this season Hes doing a music great job Lets see what he does in this upcoming possession Started out only 25 from the floor but you have a feeling its going to go up Averaged 14 points a game last year at Tennessee Tech Takes an open three here Rims it out Big rebound for Geron Pierre Jr SMU early on by seven Goofy Miller has a couple free throws feeds Germaine ONeal Jr Great look at a wing three and Washington right there for the offensive rebound Deron Pierre Wow that reverse layup Nearly went as he skyed all the all the way underneath the glass Deep triple in transition for Louis Jordan The Englishman cant make it go Its out of bounds Last touch by SMU Thats one of the things SMU has to eliminate are those open threes in transition Thats one of the keys to the game is getting back in defense in transition and setting up uh half court defense Jordan very much trusted trying to hit the three at UNMBC last year Led all division one threepoint shooters with at least 100 attempts He hit a 49 clip Thats incredible for a 69 former right Yeah he can shoot it He can step out Uh he can roll to the rim but hes going to be a dynamic player for the Islanders D Jones shut down so far Sets up Rickby in the corner Just cant knock it down Highlanders are getting some good looks offensively They are Theyre getting what they want as Cory Henderson get Cory Washington gets one up Excuse me Uh Mustangs knock down another triple But the Highlanders are getting what they want Uh its just now about making shots And thats one of the things Coach Chu talked about This team can be fluid but we got to make shots to add on to that fluidity Yeah the threepoint field goal percentage early this season for Radford theyre getting the looks but its only a 29 music Thats 315th in the country out of 360 some odd teams Thats right So just now you have to really really make sure if youre the Highlanders getting into that paint and trying to drop it off getting high percentage shots The Moody crowd loves the next level effort of the freshman Germaine ONeal Jr He really plays like a veteran out music there Doesnt look like a freshman does he Yeah Germaine ONeal is just hes athletic He can get on the ground He can run in transition but hes playing hard Thats why hes earning these minutes SMU with that best recruiting class in their history Brown had to let it go doesnt normally shoot from outside but had to put it up with only one on the shot clock Mustangs are doing a great job on offense being patient finding the shot that they want but we got to protect the ball Jane ONeal going baseline for a drift pass And this is where the Mustangs can continue to be great Floyd Washington again the pace that he has the the glue that he has to be a great player on the offensive def defensive end hes doing a great job Are the Mustangs just looking for the mismatch there on that side Jaylen Johnson only 6 ft tall Thats right And Cory Washington can play that role being 65 being at that height uh against smaller guards can take him down to the post and go right up and get fouled or get an easy bucket Seven to shoot it now Dell Jones heaves and hits Very capable of heating up quickly Dell Jones averaging 17 a game Thats what he does He is a high usage player Uh is looking to score and he can get it up He has the opportunity Meanwhile Washington looking for his third triple already This will be a foul on SMUs Mitchell Holmes in the short time hes been on the floor Hes picked up his second team foul number three and number two on SMU as well 12 minutes left in the first half Going back to Dale Jones man like hes hes hes so good Uh 27th the other night against UNCW and as long as he finds that that microwave scoring can can turn on and he can get going at any point seems like for Zach Chua in company and well talk about this throughout Theyre looking for some other guys that can help out Dell Jones and Dennis Parker is Yigolu or rather theyre going to call it on BJ Edwards not on Yiglu for grabbing music the arm of Dell Jones Jones will hit the line Dell Jones attacking downhill and finding the body of Ilu But the call the foul is called on BJ Edwards But great job by Dell Jones by getting downhill and not settling for the three Jay Edwards probably feels a little snake bit there Got a lot of ball Dell Jones hell get to the line on you 71 on the year 72 for his career And the sophomore transferring in from Clemson a high major recruit a top 75 recruit in the class of 2024 Uh hes got explosion Hes got things to his game that the average player just doesnt have Yeah hes just playing it and its not something that he wants to hide Uh to be that highly touted of a player and to go to Clemson and not really get the the outlook that you wanted uh coming here to Rafford and have the opportunity to showcase his skill set 40 3176 slash last year at Clemson Edwards rolls the three around and out Dell Jones is there to start the break Sets up Jaylen Johnson Goes baseline Kicks it out Balls catch and shoot way over the top SMU trying to get out in transition and do a great job of it Averaging about 19 points on the fast break a game this season The Mustangs are great in transition just as well as they are in half court getting it down low as we have it turned over again for the Mustangs Coming to the other side of the court Radford is doing a great job moving it but we just got to get it to the point where they can get some get some buckets in the in the cup Bradford turns opponents over about 13 and a half times a game Great wraparound pass into Tyson Brown and thats why he shoots 70 from the floor And John we talked about how the NBA plays in the pro level You have a lot more more passing more more actions as we have another turnover by the Mustangs as they get back in defensive transition Johnson around that screen and shoot three instead Bottoms for Jordan and a timeout called by SMU Louisie Jordan who hit 49 of his out shot side shots a season ago Its his 10th music of the Young season Radford was down big early now only trailing by three Well that shows you the resilience Thank you Bri Uh it shows you the resilience of the Raptor Highlanders and the coaching that coach Shu and the assistant coaches put into this culture Pierre Junior in the middle and he feeds it down to Washington Denied at first but he stays right with it again The extra effort of Cory Washington who leads all scorers with a dozen Bradford Highlanders continue to fight stay in this game And for Radford Dell Jones limited to four so far And nothing yet for Dennis Parker Jr Both of those guys averaged 17 a game They each had 27 last time out against UNCC Wilmington Fighting inside Tyson Brown comes up a bit short SMU was able to close down a 9 run by Ratford last time up with that Washington bucket Now looking for more Gigatola deep catch falls right down to Pierre Jr but he cant finish Bradford has SMU a team that nearly shoots at about 50 as Washington gets knocked in the face shooting at only 33 so far Something that Ratfords got to take advantage of here sooner or later Jaylen Johnson downhill falling no call Oh Oh Cory Washington music gets hit in the face Foul on the Highlanders Hes going to give it to Jaylen Johnson here Of course from his contact with the foot there Weve had a couple possessions uh on both sides of the floor that have been a little erratic but I think were getting back to that that pace of playing half toward getting the shots that we want Miller finds Edwards always willing to make the extra pass Washington cant knock it down out of the corner but good offense for SMU And Lucas Walls kind of a physically imposing guard music at 65 Pulls down the board Yes indeed Those are the shots youre looking for if youre coach Infield and the Mustangs Wide open corner threes that are high percentage shots Uh if youre not getting in the paint those are thats a shot that you want to see SMU as a team this season hitting 37 of their threes but theyre not a three hungry team really They want to put pressure on the rim this season That was way short for Dell Jones but its taken right back by Jones Washington Blocks Brown inside and then REJECTED AGAIN LOOSE BALL Never say die defense Its going to stay here with Radford but Tyson Brown was not given the easy way out here music Cory Washington throws it back in uh but throws it back to Brown Brown goes up Cory Washington come in with an extra effort Multiple efforts on the defensive end for the Mustangs and music they come out with the fight Backto back blocks by Washington on the play And again Tyson Brown a guy that shoots 70 from the floor but hes one of six in this one cuz SMU is making the interior so tough to score in Only 20 points in the paint last time out for Radford as they played UNCW Jones picked up by Washington D2 it goes Well theyre going to call it a three but review it I thought the foot was on the line but well see And again the officials called it a three on the floor so we will for Jones doing what he does best Hes getting to his spots and getting shots up Edwards rocking the baby Washington diving into the paint and this will be a travel on Edwards Little step back and SMU continues to be a little disjointed offensively at times An uncharacteristic five turnovers early make it six now on the Mustangs This is the poise of this team As long as long as they find a way to keep themselves in the fight and music in the game I think they have a great opportunity to keep to spread this lead open a little bit more music But Rafford doing a great job of keeping this a game Jaylen Johnson out of the contest Zack Ju who was on the bench for Andy Enfield last season looking for his team to snap a fivegame losing streak But it has been a long slog of tough road games and neutral sight efforts as well for Ratford Backing his way in Dennis Parker Jr does not go Boopy Miller clears the car and runs the break BJ Edwards Jr left corner triple knocks it down and the seal is taken off for BJ Edwards Roll the turkey Exactly Thanksgiving week It is Thanksgiving week Got to give thanks SMU Mustangs Bradford Highlanders SMU 6 and0 on the season Radford trying to snap a fivegame losing streak Ericson stepping into the triple and off the mark but Pierre Jr just could not get both paws on it Theyll stay here with Radford Although that was a miss by Erikson I think the the Radford Highlanders did a great job of controlling that possession uh limiting the dribbles keeping the ball in the air and finding an open shot But they like Ed Erikson a lot I mean hes played at the highest pro level over in Germany Hes originally from Denmark but hes got that pro experience that youre seeing from so many of the Europeans coming over now And you know it makes him even more of a factor as a freshman for Radford Another deep look very deep for Dell Jones Gigatu doubled inside knocked away with no call Let him play a little bit Poopy Miller short corner fade away Offensive rebound and the stick back does it full for BJ Davis Ray But IU is there and Pierre Jr gets a great look Cant make it go But Washington third offensive rebound to skip to the hoop and off the euro Hes got 14 in the first half Wow What a great job offensive rebounded by the Mustangs But defensive transition has to be a key They have to get back and cant celebrate for Ratford Thats their first two in transition And its also the first two for Parker High release for Miller and Jones is called for being in his sphere of influence Dell Jones whistled for his second and Boopy Miller who hasnt necessarily looked for his shot a lot early goes to the line Booby Miller with a little step push off and he gets it up gets fouled by Dale Jones Cross the 1500 point plateau His first time at the free throw line But Miller means so much more to this SMU team than just as a scoreer Also right now seven and a half assists per game That is seventh in the nation right now You know what does he mean to SMU as a distributor too Hes a general Uh he he he keeps the team poised He keeps everybody in their place just by him having the ball He makes it easy for his teammates to be great players Its been a great start to the season for SMU eclipsing the 100 point plateau three of the last four games Miller has four all with the charity strike SMU back up by six Turning to the glass off the glass and in Dennis Parker Jr now looking for his shot and forcing it up Able to kiss it in plus all the contact Parker getting into a small post up and fighting his way to this bucket Way to earn you one DJ Davis Ray trying to go up high with the two hands but getting called for it Parker the transfer from NC State as part of that magical final four run a couple years ago for the Wolfpack spent two seasons at NC State and now has really flourished at Radford where hes been in double figures every game this season That says a lot Threepoint play makes it a threepoint game Ratford doing more than hanging around Miller from the LOGO BURIES THE TRIPLE And you see Rafford has gone into a zone and SMU exploiting that zone and find an open shot by being patient as SMU has constructed this season I wouldnt blame teams if they zoned him a little bit I agree I think thats thats something you have to put in front of them Uh SMU shoots it well So you have to always be account for that But on the defensive end you also got to be accounted for for Parker shooting a three All right Dennis Parker Jr really heating up since he came back into the game He has eight quick points What else would he expect Hes averaging 17 coming off a careerhigh 27 Miller wants another one Hes got another one All of a sudden Boopy Miller is in double figures for SMU IS JOHNSON GOING TO MAKE ONE ITS RAINING THREES We are trading threes here Miller with two of them Johnson coming down Its got the crowd into it Johnson from Houston playing in his HOME STATE BOOPY WHAT A THIRD STRAIGHT Poopy Miller He is on fire Quite literally NBA jam style Parker taking it inside and fouled Why has this game opened up all of a sudden Is it just the shot making Did you see anything that led to this Because I didnt see this coming We were kind of in a grind and now weve got threes on like five straight possessions I think both teams have settled in SMU started off kind of getting some extra shots getting some extra looks that looked good and felt good Uh Raford had to fight for a couple but now they found their pace found their feel and playing off each other very well Dennis Barker Jr only 54 at the line in his career And you see that Jaylen Johnson just reached 1000 career points Congratulations to Johnson who not only played at Tennessee Tech but also over the years for Concordia University in his freshman season So started at the the lowest level of uh NCAA athletics where he averaged 20 points a game as a freshman and blossomed from a D3 player all the way into a big time D1 contributor Congrats to Johnson to get out of Houston Texas Summer Creek High School You know good things come out of Houston Texas I guess you can say that Besides the humidity there are some good things that come out of Houston Thats what Oh he thought about pulling it Hes looking for four straight Hes smarter than that Or is he Miller trying to kiss one home I think I would have liked the logo three better Right up the floor NOBODY STOPS THE BALL AND RIGBY SAYS DONT MIND IF I DO Brennan Riggsby Jr and one Rigsby straight down the channel right down the line getting fouled finishing strong at the rim Great job Riby The Highlanders I mean theyre setting that up because theyre a spotted threepoint shooting team in transition Everybody went with the shooters right And nobodys thinking coming to the hole And thats on the side of what Coach Chu does great with his players is is allow them to be fluid You know they can see that SMU is guarding the threes in transition Hey might as well take it to the cup This guy has a chance to have a really good season Brendan Rickby Jr uh year at Minnesota two at Oregon So hes already played three years of E4 basketball and now getting a chance at Radford to really be a team leader this season ONeal Jr in trouble Johnson with the swipe first to the ground Theyre normally going to get it Walls curling in against Washington playing with two fouls Heres Johnson Radford looking for the lead this trip Pick and roll the layup Its good but a foul offensive as Washington who could have taken his third the advantage But Cory Washington getting there in time And its a call that SMU needed to go their way because Washington already with two personal fouls here in the first half BJ Edwards also has two personals but he is back on the floor One three zone here for Ratford If SMU can find an open look down the baseline Nice job catch inside by Holmes off the feed by Germaine ONeal Jr That is high execution by the Mustangs to come out of the timeout and to score out of the timeout Freshman and a red shirt freshman combining for the bucket Threepointer by Parker Jr ONeal comes out with it SMU by three with three minutes left in the first half Pierre slithering up top Finds Edwards coming off his triple double Pivots Pierre Jr Back up to Edwards ranging to the cup with that big second step but staying right with him to block it away Dennis Parker Jr his fifth rejection of the season Bradford came out of the timeout BJ Edwards headed downhill with extra step music block out of bounds SMU has hit five of their last seven field goals Ratford five of their last six Tiptoeing baseline this time Germaine ONeal Jr gets fouled Why do you try to work the baselines against the zone like SMU is doing here You want to put your most athletic guys on the baseline Because you have back door cuts Anytime the big guy steps up you have those baselines for cutters and actions to go on Jeron Pierre finding Germaine ONeal on the back door cut Germaine ONeal very athletic That is what he can do for the Mustangs is cut back door run transition get to the free throw line can be very efficient Tyson Brown his second foul Germaine ONeal Jr averaging five and a half points and three rebounds a game this season but his last two games have been his best Hes averaged 13 a game over his last two and done so in just about 18 and 12 minutes of work Hes showing it Hes showing what he can do with the minutes given to him Uh the first few games of the season he has taken his time to get his foot feet under him Now hes getting the feel and hes showcasing his skills Hes just a guy that understands I mean he doesnt get out there and chase highlights He plays within the possession and and what you want to do in your system Yeah thats the pro mindset he has His last name is ONeal and his dad played in the NBA and hes been around it So he knows what to look for and how he can help serve this team Rare turnover for Radford Thats only the third giveaway When you think about it overall for Zack Chus team I I know it hasnt always been the prettiest first half but you look up youre only down by four two and a half minutes remaining in the first half How do you think youre feeling I think hes feeling really good Obviously hes going to have something to say to to make his team better but to be playing the SB Mustangs at this level at this pace uh theyre doing a great job from the be down four Ruby Miller has 13 points on only five attempts Tried to hit Yigutou Couldnt slam it home Reathers and jams it The 7 foot2 Yigu on the board Time out Bradford And I think its that theyre just being more aggressive Theyre going downhill and finding the shots that they want SMU with the 221 34 court Bradford does a nice job to break it See the Mustangs in the zone just to give a different look Trying to unsettle Bradford but Jaylen Johnson is unfathered Bombing home a three Johnsons second triple as a team Ratford has knocked down six ONeal Jr able to jump out of his shoes to gather that one in Skips to the cup Hits the right hand runner from six feet Hes finding himself Hes feeling himself Great strong drive into the paint Hes getting under control and going up into an easy touch boat Just a steady confidence for the freshman Meanwhile Jaylen Johnson starting to play like himself Gets a paint touch Flicks it out for Rickby Does it go but finds the rebound JOHNSON HAS IT AGAIN He has hit three triples in the first half He was 0 of nine his last two games from three but now JJ is dialed in Backto back threes by JJ really really good job to stay in gives it up Poopy Miller the big first half himself Catch and shoot by ONeal Ses right in front of the bench That is the confidence were talking about from a freshman coming into the with the Mustangs and being able to play at this level consistently Slow start here in Dallas but its on now Johnson underneath around a guy with 14 in on him pulls the trigger That was the heat check SMU by five and looking for more Miller doesnt pull it this time Instead on the reverse pivot fade away Doesnt pull Miller trying to get a quick shot up for a two for one Thats a pro mindset right there That is That is That shows the IQ and the level that he plays at 3se second difference game clock to shot clock for these two teams that want to play like NBA squads especially on the offensive end Jaylen Johnson nine points here recently trying to drive into ONeal cuts it to the glass does not fall 7 seconds as he has it a threeon two Pierre into THE BODY KISSES IT AND ONE transition points for the Mustangs right at the depth of the first half High level move by Drum here Getting it downhill You can told getting it out Pushing the transition Look at the clock He knows he has to get downhill and score He makes a strong move to the basket and one Great job Pierre Jr fifth leading scorer among music 51 players Completes the and one And a little flourish for SMU 23 left in the half Getting Tyson Brown in as a screener here in the back court from three quarter court music PARKER OH just off and Radford It was a tight one at 40 to 38 but SMU scores the last six points of the first half including a threepoint play by Geron Pierre Jr to make it an eightpoint lead at the break Jaylen Johnson after not starting the game starts the second half for Radford Of course he had nine points on three triples in that first half trying to be the third option behind Dell Jones and Dennis Parker Jr Radford in the blue SMU in the white Great to have you with us Last game before Thanksgiving before between these two teams great look for Johnson out of the corner Doesnt fall Iollu thought his shirt got pulled Probably right The officials let it go Miller inside Iu collects himself Has it dislodged as he brought it down but it stays with music SMU S Yutolu being 72 he has to keep the ball high Bringing it down low he gets an opportunity for the music smaller guards to get in and take it away from him Ive also heard coaches say you know if you are going to bring it down that power dribble like low to the ground but you cant be in the middle right Thats right Thats right You dont want that in between cuz thats where you got guys like Luke Miller in there and BJ Edwards swiping in Edwards scores and then a steal for SMU They only had a few in the first half after 26 against Arkansas State Deron Pierre Jr didnt have the greatest game scoring in the first half but he is forcing the issue This SMU team loves to get to the line Johnson coming off the bench with nine points and you have other guys like Frederick Ericson knocking down a three Louis Jordan and Brendan Risby So uh that thats a big deal uh for the for the Radford Highlanders as they finish this second half and see if they can continue to get production from their bench You know for Radford last time out they got the 27 points a piece from Jones and Parker against UNCCW but everybody else on the team combined for only 19 So those two had 74 of the production Tonight the guys not named Parker and Jones already have 22 So immediately theres a huge improvement there Yeah its its its a thing Its the way Coach Chu can continue to see the fine identity of his team and he can see that two guys can go score 27 on the night and then you can have your bench come score uh against SMU Mustangs So foul on Ceette Yigu here So itll stay here with Radford as SMU has slowly built their lead matching their largest at 12 Radford hasnt scored in the second half Free Sorenson and to Ray for Im John Little outside Johnson gets a great look and a three and drops it in Jaylen Johnson Yeah hes in his bag with 12 in this game Just four shy of a season high John we call that an elevator An elevator He came up and found his groove found his spot and was wide open and knocked down the shot And coach Juke talks about how yeah in the flow were not calling plays but on out of bounds plays Thats where youre going to see a lot of the plays called Right Thats right And they have been executing out of bounds on that three Washington to Edwards Got to finish this right My goodness And it will be a foul on the floor Washington that next level effort to make the pass from his back and then challenge to get an offensive rebound as well Yes This number three in white He just never stops No no And I dont think he has a plan to stop at anytime soon but I love his game and I love how hard he plays because hes going to get rewarded on the other side of it Foul goes on Dennis Parker Thats number two QUICK ONE IN THATS IT Plus the foul BJ Edwards Such an excellent athlete music Dale Jones with his back to the ball and Booby call him slipping Great catch by BJ Edwards to get it up get fouled and finish the cover Wow And for Boofy Miller that is already assist number eight in this game to go along with 13 points So hes already over his average in assists Didnt take long to get there at all Not at all Boopys looking comfortable tonight Uh shooting it from the three and also getting it to his teammates So BJ Edwards hits on the threepoint play his first game coming off the sixth triple double in SMU history The first one ever to include steels as part of the triple double Parker out top nearly thrown away on the deck and its stolen away by SMU Pierre up the gut repenet on the way to the glass He hits it past walls A micro wave scored Once he sees his lane hes going to get downhill And we got a technical foul called against Radford here And its going to be on the bench Want to make sure it was on Chu It was certainly pointed in that direction And I believe it was the head coach that picked it up Ruby Miller the beneficiary at the line downhill Jeron Pierre straight to the cup getting around balls and finishes strong and SMU on another 70 run here over the last 30 seconds just as Radford had hit their first bucket of the second half SMU extends the lead out to 16 And so Tony Padilla one of the best there is in college basketball And coach Chu music coming to an understanding Now its time for Radford to make a stand here cuz SMU is really starting to stretch the lead Yeah its about being way way more disciplined on the defensive end Uh not giving up easy buckets and sending them to the free throw line So lets see what they do on offense This young team 13 of 14 new players for Radford trying to break a 15game losing streak Miller smoothly into the front court Pops from the baseline Rebound brought in by Erikson Highlanders looking for some easy points Erikson sinks the defense Kicks it out Walls doesnt go Not a lot of second chance opportunities for the Highlanders tonight And thats where they can when theyre shooting threes they can have long rebounds Most of your threepoint shots are going to have long rebounds which they could get Theyre not getting them right now Washington Eaten He is attacked Heaten takes more than the average contact Looks like an uncle playing you know pickup basketball with the kids on Thanksgiving and theyre just trying to like hang on him you know Right Right But hes being strong down there We dont know how much is going on but he is being strong and trying to finish at the rim Radford determined not to give Cemetu the easy points down there Foul went on Erikson That is his first music getting back into the game The big man Tyson Brown Brown only one of six from the floor And what you see from SMU right now is theyre getting to the free throw line a lot more Theyre attacking the lane attacking the paint getting downhill attacking oneon ons and when somebody helps theyre giving it up to the next teammate and were trying to finish at the rim Again Andy Enfield talks about rim pressure and how much his team loves to do that 68 of their points this season either coming from inside the paint or at the free throw line Great pass to the baseline but Yiku challenges blocks and then takes away the rebound Dell Jones denied Rafford getting a good look there Just missing it Theyre getting what they want Theyre seeing what they want They just got to hit shots to make shots to close this lead And Pierre trying to slip through traffic A reachin foul Low dribble by Don Pierre Looks like all ball but he may got some finger on there Jaylen Johnson gets the foul called on him Mustang basketball Probably the right call on Johnson his second You look at team fouls in the second half Bradfords not going to love the fact that its 51 at this point Edwards sees a seam tried to go back up while he was coming down Lost it going up Transition Griggsby cant pull the trigger Has a new back defensively Great job by the Mustangs by getting back on defensive transition Theyve only given up three points in transition tonight That was one of the keys of the game and they are showing Meanwhile Poopy for two in transition and thats 13 tonight And Zack 2 all the way out to midcourt to call timeout You can see it in their face and you can see it with the applause crowd This team loves that transition offense Yeah hes trying to get out there again and do it as a part of his identity trying to get go get music it Go steal one Already 13 points in transition tonight for SMU Boopy Miller what efficiency 18 points on only eight field goal attempts in this one Oh thats right Boopy like I said is playing so efficient This is what he does Hes a general and he just likes to keep the pace of the game So Mustangs can play at the highest level Miller so fast yet under control as well Miller complete game goes baseline stops on a dime and has up in the air Miller going to take a second to collect himself Boopy still in the baseline Smart takes his time with a shot fake protecting himself right there on the finish Gets fouled Headed to the free throw line shots SMU has a new largest lead an 110 run over the last 222 Miller having a lot to do with that Andy Enfield wanted to see his team take care of the ball better in the second half They havent turned it over that has helped him get out in transition as well as Radford has been missing shots and turning it over too Mustangs ripping out to a big lead Johnson kicks it out to the corner Thats a three that Blitzby really needed but its blocked out of the corner Pierre downhill willing to give it up Edwards the extra step in the lane doesnt fall Big board for Louis Jordan Mustangs playing fast in transition trying to go get them a quick bucket Jones turns against Miller Had the height advantage Cant pull it Johnson hand in his face Out to Jordan Long miss long rebound That ones down for Louis Jordan We talked about it coming out the half Coach Chu wanted his team to rebound Any extra possessions that they can get they turn into offensive shots And this time he knocks it down Jordan six points in only five minutes of work now against the two3 zone Edwards trying to swing the ball against it and finds Pierre in the corner Way short on the three but its kept alive by Pierre Miller only three to shoot Pierre is going to get ANOTHER CHANCE THIS TIME HE HITS Another assist for Boopy Miller Great shot by Jon Pierre Way to be stationed One miss by Don Pierre Air ball He does not give up on the play Great rebound by BJ Edwards Poised by Boopy Miller Crosscourt skip Knocked down by JP Great shot You know an underrated part of Pierres game here recently has been his willingness to rebound Hes one of the games leading rebounders with nine in this one And Buffy Miller with nine assists in this contest too Corner triple Little bit long 35 from outside for Radford SMU continues to dominate the second half And its going to be a foul against Ilu here or a three in the lane One of the two No theyre going to get just a offensive foul against You get told who doesnt want to come out of the matchup Pierre being patient here Just letting music the offense set up Hes having some fun with this But we have a foul down at the bottom Thats not called is looking like where wheres my call But you have to be smart Oh goodness You know a little flail by Louis Jordan Thats thats fine A little little acting We got a little little acting here Game within the game Second foul on Yiglu who has 10 rebounds Last touch by Edwards here Look at DJ Edwards getting his hand on the ball being active on the defensive end Like you said 10 steals in a triple double That that is unheard of Already 13th in team history in steals all time Had a single season steel record last year Erikson gets it back Iu does foul here as Erikson tries to turn past him Thats three on set Yollu Yuku music battling down there but headed to the bench with his third foul Keep playing strong Rafford staying aggressive on this end trying to close out this this deficit here music BJ Edwards a little bit more on his historic night I mean this has got to be one of the best allaround performances in SMU history and ACC history He sets career highs in points assists and steals all in the same game That sounds like a night for BJ Edwards How do you go home and how do you see yourself You see yourself as a as a perennial player but that does not happen every night So he should be proud of himself as a player Uh and his teammates should be proud of him also And this is for a thirdyear starter as well Its not like you know a freshman going out there and he just happens to you know play the most minutes hes ever played This is a guy its a key COD Had a night to remember for sure But you can see how he plays Hes very under control and less turnovers which can turn into assistant buckets Looking for it all for Washington who rolls it in Cory Washington delivers his first deuce of the second half Hes six of nine from the floor Two assists for Edwards tonight Johnson attacking Now left Johnsons aggressiveness in this one Yeah it ends up in a travel but Jaylen Johnson looks like hes trying to kickstart his season with a good performance here in Dallas Yeah hes been doing a great job shooting the ball tonight but thats a key to the game was to control possessions and you have to be very smart about turning the ball over and making sure you have the best opportunity to score SMU outscoring Radford 21 to8 since the break Pierre doubled gets out of it Miller sets it up to Pierre Corner three A little short on that one Good job to attack the board by Radford as theyve given up 10 offensive rebounds to the Mustangs tonight Oh that ones right to BJ Edwards fever and for two BJ Edwards in the passing lane That is what he does Get out in transition go get you a quick bucket You just got to know where he is at all times Thats right Youre seeing the Mustangs score in 3 to 5 seconds and those are efficient buckets that you want Either that or going to the free throw line and scoring when no time is coming off the clock Bradford also a team that eventually would love to get to that point where theyre able to play like SMU in transition Johnson had to hoist a little discombobulated Its Washington coming off the screen Johnson clears the carum looking for Jones Little bit out of control in transition A little OUT OF CONTROL HE NEARLY MADE THAT BY SCOOPING it back in Heres a threeon two Edwards around and off Fastpaced game right now Couple missed shots on both ends but were getting back under control Yeah a missed underhanded falling out of your the out of bounds flip That one would have went down Its gotten a little pelter skelter here for sure Ridgby a lot of him dribbling on this possession Offensive rebound Erikson 20 to shoot it Good side step by Jordan Cant make it go though And big Mitchell Holmes pulls down the carum Were do a timeout SMU wants to go ahead and take it 1039 Those good shots have led to 47 shooting for the Mustangs tonight 10 and a half to play Mustangs led at the half by eight Back to her feet Germaine ONeal Jr who can get up Just wanted a little bit closer to the rim SMU making nearly wholesale substitutions here Their starters had been on the floor for quite a while Edwards is the only starter out there now with a bevy of freshman And as Parker attacks on the curling drive out of the corner hes fouled Strong drive by by Parker to get into the paint Uh just a foul by Mitchell Holmes Little undisiplined Uh but Im sure Parker wants to see the ball go in the cup so that he can regain his confidence Holmes one of the four freshman on the floor right now for SMU Dennis Parker Jr hadnt scored since the break That gives him 11 And hes been in double figures every game for Radford all eight games Previously in his career all the contests he played with NC State about 55 of them he had only been in double figures six times Wow That lets you know what what an opportunity can do for a player being put in the right position feels like he has in this positionless team for Radford Obvious moving screen on Chance Purer picks up his first but a good chance for Andy Enfield to get some of his freshman battle tested SMU is about to go into a really tough stretch of games Four straight against SEC competition starting with Mississippi State Next time out the day after Thanksgiving Thats right Little bowling ball by Dennis Parker Jr taking the freshman into the post And this is good for the SN Mustangs to have this group on the floor to get some minutes Uh it gives them an opportunity just in case youre getting those big games and you need these players to separate Germaine ONeal Jr just over the top That ones last touched by Parker Stay here with SMU Mustangs with a rare scoring drought music Their longest of the game at three minutes Boopy Miller back in music for Chance Purer Miller working on another music outstanding game with 20 points and nine assists tonight Hes on the cusp of a double double Looking for it here Have a chance with another inbound pass If youre the SMU Mustangs this is a great time to find the balance between pushing the throttle and at the same time being poised and patient to find the shots that you want So theres going to be games you got to manage over the course of the season Thats what you got to manage Yep Yep As you know in college basketball anything can happen Guys can make shots just as it had in the first half Holmes doubled kicks it Edwards Poopy Miller gets back Edwards didnt let it go in time Nice job by Dennis Parker Jr to make Edwards not think about the fact the shot clock was pressing down And that is what you mean by control the possession by the Rafford Highlanders on the defensive end If they can make a team have shot clock violations be out of rhythm that is what you want Thats what coach wants Bradford trying to avoid a sixth straight loss Started out the season 2 and 0 Highlanders with a high ceiling this season if they put it all together Its also a low floor when youre trying to put together a completely new team Yeah its a its its something that you want to see but at the same time it always doesnt work out Davis Ray attacking the glass Got that seal off from Holmes Just could not finish Even with the freshman on the floor Ratford hasnt really taken advantage Threepointer doesnt go down for Walls Offensive rebound though by Parker Repenetrates and kisses it home Strong strong drive by Parker getting to the cup and getting to the rim Finding his rhythm again Really play above the rim Exciting aggression and ferocity in the junior transfer Goofy Miller ONeal a little bit out of control and Parker Jr picks his pocket Miller nearly able to take it right back Jones against the freshman defender in ONeal and a commonly great defender Jones against Edwards JONES HITS IT in his face Dell Jones his first point since early on in this matchup and SMU Hes embracing that responsibility and growing every day Away from the ball We got a stoppage cement Yiglu who a couple games ago rolled his ankle is down underneath the basket I must admit I did not see exactly what occurred but holding that left lower leg on it right now 72 270 So SMU going to Mitchell Holmes inside without their Turkish center at least for now Only six to shoot Pierre penetrates baseline jumper from the short corner Rims out Rigsby trying to continue the 9 run that Ratfords currently on and make a stand here against SMU on the road Johnson tears around inside again Locked down low is Brown Grabs his own Still 10 to shoot Griggsby leaned on Kisses it high off the glass Making an 110 run for Radford Great great slot drive by Griggsby to get downhill not to get stopped and go up strong Whos going to be the run buster for SMU Miller the step through Hell get it done Patience patience patience Miller up to 22 points tonight plus his nine dimes Jones tears the corner and Edwards even the great defender that he is cant stay with Dell Jones And SMU has to think where is that backside defender thats supposed to be there on that slot drive Thats two in a row for the Redford Highlanders Edwards penetrating miss scooping G rebound for Tyson Brown Bes Johnson into the front court Pitch back Jones goes baseline Hanging in the air Sets up Parker Catch and shoot Rings out That would have been huge for Rafford Still still coach Chu is clapping because he knows that was a great possession And if you can stack great possessions on great possessions youll eventually come down and make shots and go on the run Its about the process more than the results as the coach will say on you Washington gives it away Jones fouled Great job by Dell Jones to attack the glass Radford is the aggress aggressor right now They are trying to go downhill will look for what Dale Jones getting downhill going into the body of Cory Washington but BJ Edwards again trying to go for the block Fouls Jones Edwards able to play from midway through the first half through this point without picking up his third foul But Jones a 71 foul shooter rims out the first Jones has been in double figures in six of the eight this season One for two trip there and Radford once down in this matchup by 23 clawing back to within 11 Five and a half remaining Thats what youre going to recognize in college basketball Game of runs as we have a guard to guard ball screen with Miller and BJ Edwards Back to Miller Pitches it off Edwards three is up and no And on the rebound theres a hold in there and Radford is over the limit Itll be a one and one for SMU music That one goes on Tyson Brown number three And who was fouled It was either Holmes or Washington Washington hoping to take him but Holmes will be the one for the one and one here He has hit his only free throw attempt of the season And that ball goes up Shot goes up Cory Washington homes Theyre doing a great job of going around the rim and trying to find an offensive rebound and theyre causing havoc which is causing fouls which is sending them right back to the free throw line If you coach infield youre happy only being up 11 right now when you were just up 23 I think its a great opportunity to manage the game with effort with grit and finding the best shot possible music Rainy day here in Dallas A lot of moisture evidently or rainy morning at least front end of a one and one for Holmes and he makes it good Big man out of Fort Worth Spent a year at Link Year Prep and the Oakidge School as well Averaging five points two rebounds a game and hes been productive when hes out there shooting 71 from the floor Got to like that for the red shirt freshman Thats music right Not as vertical but very good with his feet and hands and knows what hes looking for on the floor Dicey pass gets knocked away The hand in his face Jordan couldnt pull the trigger Jones picked up by Holmes Nice job to stay with him and force Jones to dribble it out That is a big dude for Mitchell Holmes sliding the feet and staying with a much quicker player And the presence of Mitchell Holmes just being there staying vertical staying tall and everything else works out Dale Jones just a little out of control going downhill loses it as he bumps it into Mitchell Holmes And it kind of looked like Boopy Miller got his hand in there as well SMU up by 13 The lead has been as many as 23 Miller running the show Edwards drifts baseline Washington gets a cover ITS PETER HANGING Cant roll it in right to Washington Good things happen to good people Cory Washington a double double tonight Threepointer in transition though just when you think Radford might be buried not so fast as Jordan knocks down his third triple Edwards probing kicking to Washington who has 18 tonight Washington loses it Jordan on the deck for it 12point game Four minutes left Can they make it a onedigit game Not on this trip Edwards This high energy contest Trapped on the double Feeds it out to Boopy Sets up Washington THREEPOINTER ROLL IT DOWN And if you are number six unra you cannot help off the corner on a single side uh drive The moment he stepped in and helped on the drive he opened up the corner three Doesnt matter whos coming at you but especially Boopy Miller who has 10 assists and his third career game of 20 plus points and 10 plus assist Jordan corner triple set play for him Doesnt fall Radford finds themselves down by 15 after fighting back in Miller Great look Washington trying to put the game away and just a little long Thats a high level crosscourt pass Just a miss by Cory Washington A great look by Miller Washington on a season high 21 and then called for the foul back the other way But it has been a productive night for the young man from Little Rock thats got a really big game Cory incredible And thats back when you were on the team Jere that is back when I had a jersey on But it just it just displays what SMU does and how you play on with this jersey on Uh but Booby Miller Cory Washington and Jeron Pierre are all playing in a triplet type of situation where theyre being aggressive being strong making shots and going after rebounds and passing to their teammates And sadly I I would love to complete it by saying Drey Foster was one of the guys that night that had that double double but he was he was not So 7 and four and three assists that night Not bad But it was 22 and 15 from Ben Moore 18 and 23 from Jordan Tolbert and 10 and 11 from Sterling Brown So that that sounds about right That is SMU was out rebounding Nicholls that night 62 to 25 You guys are getting on the boards man Oh it sounds like Jordan Tober man 23 rebounds But no that thats just like I said that is what you want to see from any head coach wants to see from their team having multiple guys uh being able to do multiple things on the floor Now CTO can score a few more points I mean could you have a Youd have to really hustle here but uh a fourth double double dude cuz hes got 10 rebounds to go along with Okay four points But but its also good to see you back out there after the ankle roll Yes that lets you know that its not as severe Hes still out there moving around uh getting rested after the games tonight to get ready for Friday Yeah that same game Sam Walters rolled his ankle and we havent seen him since for SMU And thats what you got to pay attention uh is longevity throughout the season and making sure your players are healthy but both teams are doing a great job Just some small injuries that you got to work through So quick Jaylen Johnson so sudden coming around that screen Yeah John I think thats the number three that that coach Shu was probably looking for Hes probably had a some showings that he didnt want to see but hes come alive tonight even though theyre down 13 And theyve had a tough schedule You know you think about playing UNC South Carolina in there SMU obviously a tough team but uh you know theyre taking a few lumps here early this season about to go into a four game home stand is Radford Six of the next seven at home Wouldnt be surprised to see Zack Chus team right at about 500 of over 500 when Big South play starts Yeah I agree with you the the the stretch of time that we saw in the first half when they were playing headtohead with SMU uh that is the rapper team that they can beat If they can do that for 40 minutes or at least 30 minutes uh they have a great chance of of taking these these six games at home coming up Coach Chs team playing hack here a little bit He may get that double double Yeah just might They try to get back in it Washington trying to play the spoiler there but not quite able to pull down the offensive rebound Hes got 11 rebounds to go with his 21 points Johnson voice again SMU leads the rebounding count tonight by 13 And once more Yiku is going to be attacked And you know you think about the pro game and this is an aspect of the pro game that you see sometimes you know when youre trying to get back into a contest you know you dont mind going you know uh you know giving up one point on one side to get two on the other Thats right No that is a definitely a pro move by coach Chu uh to just get one of the the worst free throw shooters on the on the SMU team uh to get him to the free throw line consistently to see if he can make shots But it gives you time to rest recover it gives you time to uh set actions up and gives you time to to come down the court and get what you need And what does it say to your team as well that hey all right were were down by 14 points with 2 minutes left but were not giving up here Thats right No it just says the resilience and and see what the team is made of from an identity culture standpoint And from the defensive end from SMU you cant get relaxed You know youve seen so many basketball games where 14 points isnt really much you know So not with the way this team can shoot the three but that one does fall off A rare bad miss from Louis Jordan who again led D1 last season 49 from outside May just about do it BD Gollu doubled and throws it away Job to lurk there for Dennis Parker downhill Jones scooping to the hoop Great patience by Jones taking an extra dribble and an extra step to get around Poopy Miller to finish on the other side Thatll put Poopy Miller at the line Chance to pad the stats for a guy whos music nine of nine from the charity stripe in this one music Radford up fouls a lot as a team at a high rate this season Usually music tried to do it strategic way and you count these last few four fouls added to the average Exactly But you know its its all strategic here Yep Meanwhile a little delay for Cory Washington to wipe off some I dont know if its it could be gravy or something It is that time of year Maybe its had some good mac and cheese in the media room No no its probably blood but you know a man can dream Thats all it is Of gravy Can we call it a triple double if Miller has hit 10 free throws and he has 10 assists and 22 points Honorary probably not but you know its an asterisk Miller has taken more and made more than anybody else in the ACC and thats going to continue after his 11 for 11 night from the free throw line tonight Wow Johnson takes the dribble handoff gets everybody off balance but IU stands up in front of Parker to deny the shot What we havent talked about enough is how well the S Mustang bigs are being at the rim going straight up vertical Jones in transition Pierre attacking the glass again You know Andy Enfield had a talk with Giron Pierre very early on in the season and I need you to get after the glass And ever since then it it was right at halftime of that Butler game Ever since then he has been a big time rebounder Hes leading this game with 13 rebounds Wow That is what you want from a real ball like that Yes Up high down hard And the dream of a double double for Ceclo is not over Thats eight and 10 Uhhuh But if youre doing numbers with time left Coach has probably been saving it And I I dont think that coach Chu has ticked off Andy Enfield like anybody else did earlier this season Do you uh remember what happened in the the Wright State game but uh or in excuse me in the Murray State game right state a team that Bradfords played Credit Radford fighting to the end tonight Now we saw the master is still the master I think the student has not yet become the teacher Thats okay Its okay Its a part of the game But you have seen some good good flashes of good basketball from Radford tonight Obviously the consistent play of SMU Uh three double doubles from their from their players But overall great matchup tonight Uh excited to see both teams continue throughout the season Not insignificant whatsoever Boopy Miller putting on a free throw shooting display Got 26 points Sixth game of his career at least 25 Jones forcing the issue He wants a little bit more here late Yeah he said hes not ready to leave Dallas just yet Not yet Not yet Dell Jones out of the DMV area of course coming over from Clemson after getting in the transfer portal in the off season Jones and Parker leading the way again tonight with 18 and 15 respectively but Jaylen Johnson joining the way with 15 And maybe thats the big three the Highlanders need Thats great Thatll do it tonight in Dallas SMU builds a lead as music many as 23 Ratford closed it down to 10 in the second half but could never climb the mountain
