thank you well youre just in time for GardnerWebb and North Carolina the top ranked Tar Heels who posted a 10286 win over the College of Charleston on Friday night meanwhile gardnerwebs been out west they lost their opener in Colorado State and fell last Thursday night by 15 points its Stephen F Austin Kareem Reed and Armando baycott get us started tonight and the Bulldogs out of the Big South Conference under the tutelage of 10th year head coach Tim Craft Reed won the tap slapped it into the GardnerWebb bench so Carolinas going to get the first possession of the ball game and gardnerweb is going to start on the mantoman they play a very aggressive man to the inside game of the Tar Heels particularly Amando baycow RJ Davis with the ball down low to faycock you see the Tar Heel lineup That features leaky blacks 100th career start a runner by love Miss badly and here is Quest Aldridge now Wes even though theyre called to running Bulldogs I dont know what they wanted a quick race with North Carolina theres a turnover by Gardner rev that features three veteran players doofy all the senior from Martinique along with the junior Selden and the senior in the post Kareem Reed for Tim Craft 25 years of age winner of 156 games in Bowling Springs Block in the corner Davis took his eye off of it but deflected by Gardner Webb heres Carolina would tend to shoot RJ Davis a background Miss keeps it alive offensive Chance for Love Applause its a three Pete Natchez and thats really good news Nance has not been a very aggressive Factor offensively in the first couple of games so maybe itll get him rolling to get that first three to go down DQ Nicholas inside from goofy all this is Reed going to work on bacock nice move with the right hand couldnt finish well Reeds pretty skilled on the inside Wes his problem is he tends to be foul flying here is bacon on the nice pick and roll black in traffic had it blocked out of there and it was Reed that slapped it away over the hit line out of bounds and another look at Pete hands man one of the things weve seen from GardnerWebb early West is that theyre trying to play Down on the inside but here they just cant get the offensive rebound but watch how the defense collapses they dont want to come out on Nance but he Nails it seldom in transition with the hammer Anthony Selden gets the Bulldogs on the board two minutes in now Selden is a veteran player hes big strong kid there goes pay cop making the move on Reed with the right hand Applause Carolinas hit just one of their first four from the floor sometimes the shooting has been a little spotty here early for North Carolina Nicholas kicks for Selden a three and it spins it into the hands of Davis here is love Carolina shot 60 percent the other night in the win against the College of Charleston good bit of that in their second half and paycock misses on the up and under looking for the foul didnt get it heres gardnerwebbin transitions Aldrich from WinstonSalem and hes fouled over play by Davis Carol is on RJ Davis his first first of all game on Carolina and with that Tim Kraft goes to the uh pitch quickly here a demide Badness checks in Lucas steeper has arrived and so has Julian Samara Applause Applause deflected to it Anthony is the younger brother of the former Kansas player Wayne Selden inside the top of the circle in the jump shot good hes got all four of garden Webbs points the dogs got a lead and weve seen the best part of seldmans game hes long and athletic he likes to shoot for three but hes really good when he drives it and finishes with that jump shot heres Davis spotting up and hitting RJ Davis a pullup jumper Dan hes averaging 14 points and three assists through the first couple of ball games now theres so much attention going to the inside and Im under Bake Off the guards have really an opportunity particularly when they are aggressive with the basketball as Davis was right there not just settling for the threes one point lead there goes Selden on the back door cup the easy dump hes got all six of Gardner reps points whereas I have no idea how do you feel about that ball through there yep love working against steeper reroute around the bacon screen a step back three bounced out Applause status Music here is Samara who came off the bench the other night in Nacogdoches Texas is sort of dropping threes on Stephen F Austin steeper see theyre trying to keep the floor spread lesson prevent them present those driving opportunities Applause Music Applause thats going to get us to a timeout Gardner Webb off to a hot start behind Anthony selda hes got all six of their points in a onepoint lead joined Dan Bonner here at Courtside he is quick to point out year two is going to be very different than year one well West thats year three will be different than year two every year is different and country to build teams youve got to build the Muhammad guys you have back you have you have to be given the opportunity you have to take the opportunity to build your team each year and thats why you play these games in November and December so you can figure things out and players can figure things out theres Nance another catch and shoot three spenzaway and the rebound for Selden who quite frankly has been a bulldog star here in the early for four minutes about 40 over 40 percent of this Google he said hes really good driving to the basket rolled around against RJ Davis Guitar Hero guard with the rebound and Davis wanted to pitch in the head but Manson looking at it is at 18 feet I think Hubert Davis does too on the drive this is Caleb Robinson hes a fascinating story in todays landscape of basketball the one that is playing out at the uh kind of the mid major down level of the D1 game well get into it as the night falls here because I think Robinson is a pretty good indicator of how you see teams at the lower level of D1 rebuild this is Samara on the pick and the layups Julian Samara whos a sophomore of the Bronx whos averaging a team High 13 points off the bench for Tim Kraft we talked about the fact that they really get after you on defense and thats why Tim Craft has substituted so liberally early so his guys can play with that intensity and this is just love is trying to reverse the ball very quickly and Samara just reads the play perfectly on the Baseline here Bulldogs are well prepared here tonight for what Carolina is going to launch ERS 11 wins in the Big South last year the master program marks theres Davis with the shot clock winding down a long missile through really good Defense Force that shot clock down had to take that shot and that wasnt really the best shot Applause wheres Robinson Reed has a reroute Samara this is steeper hes a transfer from Wisconsin Green Bay now Robinson touches through or the mans had it partially blocked bacon tried to scramble forward and finally rolls out to Davis and you get that close and youve got Nancy black and big there its hard to get that ball through that track Carolinas going three minutes without a point I need to get the ball inside Davis for Nance a three from the right corner four Pro defense six for Pete Metz hes two of his first three from behind the line and hes tied the game at eight unless you take that against the aggressive defense like that you take the ball you take it into the lane on the dribble you force the defense collapse to collapse and that will create that opening for this is Leon Williams handling it he gets it to tomorrow his three bounces out now you want to push if youre in North Carolina Applause theres a kit to fake out on the Block up strong around Reed first field goal for Armando Bangkok West baycott does such a great job running in transition he just ran right to the low post when North Carolina pushed it up before the defense got organized thats all in favor of bait cups singer from Richmond he won 22 points and seven and a half rebounds and a turnover on Robinson and with that Carolina brings Seth Trimble into the ball game as Caleb Robinson turns it over for GardnerWebb so baycott will check out and Tyler Nichol checks in 67 freshman from Harrisonburg Virginia theres Trimble now from Menomonee Falls Wisconsin hes averaging uh four points now the first two collegiate games foreign Applause black made two of those against Charleston but I think its your GardnerWebb you live with leaky black shooting the three so here is Goofy all hes back on the floor Ludovic the senior from the Martinique and also get the factory Parts goofy all rolling against nickel almost up at his feet seven to shoot for the bulldog Trail by two and this is Reed will step back over Nance and the long rebound for long North Carolinas really tightened it up defensively the last couple of possessions Caleb trying to fight through and hell draw the foul and thatll get us to a timeout to reach in on Leon Williams itll be his first sergeant Webbs first but he danced the star here early Dan well he comes in with the reputation hes the guy who can knock down the three and he certainly does there player finding the open spot which just happens to be beyond the threepoint line ended North Carolina got such a big Boost from Brady manic last year manic making the second most threepointers in the season in North Carolina history and you can see Nance hes not quite the prolific threepoint shooter 108 through his career but he is a capable passer is extremely athletic hes good defensively hes not Brady manic not better not worse hes different yep he goes with the right hand there hes going to draw the foul on Kareem Reed one of Tim Crafts concerns tonight for Gardner Webb was the status of his veteran big Dan who has been quite frankly a little prone to Falcon he has been foul prone throughout his career and I think Tim Craft is you know whats got to concern him a little bit there if Reed is going to get fouls he wants Reed to get fouls playing against baycott and so baycott is now on the bench and Kareem Reid doesnt really need to push against Pete names seven for Nance Carolina lead to three at 11day theres Armando onto the Daviss bench Applause both eight for Nance two threes pair of free throws look at DQ Nicholas back on the floor to run the offense for coachcraft and they havent been able to get anything inside the lane havent been able to get the ball in there off the dribble they want to collapse the defense and kick it out for threes when they cant bull balls were one of the last seven are now one of their last eight from the floor thats a great job by Nance to just hold his ground theyre trying to make the pass but love quit the cut I dont know where matar heals is their third here in this first half Nicholas tries to find the coach left thats just a great job by moving their feet keeping the Bulldogs out of the way Nicholas forced the shot Reed tried for the rebound Nance out of there with him try to slow down into the front court gets it to tremble Seth trumbles got some Quicks heres Nance another one how about you how about you Pete Nance hes got 11 Carolina on a 10nothing run Dan but what did Huger Davis tell us that he had a meeting with Nance and Nan said he was just trying to fit in and who you said I dont need you to fit in I need you to be a dude hes a dude tonight or hes a dude right now under 10 to go and its a seven point Tarheel lead Nicholas back to read time to work right hand on Nance and Kareem Reed gets his first field goal Reed was patient at that time and again Nance is moving his feet in there trying not to stop kind of a reroute off of that screen thats now on the block with Reed all the way and one showed you something else out of the toolbox there when that Nance is an extremely skilled player and he just is trailing on the brake and is able to knock it down again nice job forcing the defense down and Reed does a real good job right up to that point he has stopped Nance Force Nance into a tough shot and you can see there he pushed with his elbow right in front of the referee if youre going to do that its fine but you shouldnt do it right in front of us and very quickly Pete Nance has got 14 of Carolinas 18 the other two points belong to baycott and RJ Davis its a good thing to get out of class so he can come tonight outscored Gardner Webb before himself Carolina lead is eight here is Nicholas Baseline and on the deck says Patrick foul will be against the rookie tremble itll be his first and the second for Carolina Kareem Reed already goes to Dimension now Ludovic dufial a senior from Martinique also to Tim crafts Mitch Applause there is Nicholas off the inbound with the right hand and the air ball for Hance really good defense yep Carolina much improved out of the uh Under 12 timeout at that end of the floor dont you think absolutely thats a two all right hes feeling a little bit theyre not heat checked Robinson the rebound usually you dont see midrange jumpers as he checks that certainly was the case there by the way Applause working inside a nickel blocked by Nance out of bounds with a stay with the Bulldogs thats a really nice job by Nance Badness just took too long in there and allowed Nance to come over and Badness hes not looking for anybody hes looking to shoot the ball came behind the whole time and bad news never looks up to see who the open man is thats just a tremendous play Applause Music Applause Music offensive rebound thatll drive Hubert Davis crazy as the Carolina Panthers and theres Turner fighting inside with faycock the third chance for the Bulldogs and almost turned over they go to the deck and finally Trimble knocked it out Davis is going to scoop it up but not before it hit the sideline itll stay with the running Bulldogs well a chance to tell you that Mondays college basketball doubleheader here on acc Network starts in Tallahassee Dan and Ill be there to see Leonard Hamilton in Florida State against Greg Garys Mercer Bears at 6 30 and then number seven Duke welcomes Scott Davenport and Bellarmine to Cameron Indoor both right here on acc Network and the ESPN app coming up on Monday night Wes an important point to make here is the shot clock has is staying at 12 seconds North Carolina never gained possession of the ball so GardnerWebb has to be aware that the clock is run down time and the drive tomorrows second vehicle Julian samaro is a guy who will find a way to get the ball basketball thats a great job by smart he recognized that they caught was guarded and was able to get by him but he caught up strong out of a double team couldnt finish tough shot here seldom on the Republic first time these two teams ever played 2005 it was a very close to a threepoint game heres the turnover Davis pullup jumper off the rim fake contract for the tap heres black with a shot at it nickel paddle then out of there with it Robinson and Gardner Aldridge Baseline Outback Badness inside the foul on a Michael Baker so Carolina hits you with a 10nothing run to stake themselves to a sixpoint lead Chapel Hill another slow first half for Armando baycott had only one point the other night against College Charleston 27 in the second tonight two points on just one of his first six from the floor well hes had some opportunities to address I think thats the important thing for Bangkok that oh for one in the first half the other night you cant have that Reed back on the floor with the two fouls by the way for Tim Craft Aldridge are catch and shoot three Davis the rebound but again the defense was very good they werent able to get the ball close to the basket and so instead of having an open three after the defense collapse its confessing and theres a three off the dribble that is a good sign we showed you that Nance was four for six from the field the rest of the team was two for thirteen up RJ Davis knocks down the three Baseline goes Nicholas cant get through against Davis tries to rub off the Reed screen and hell drive against paycom left hand score Kareem Reed Music now you notice the half points five rebounds a year ago you notice that Gartner Webb isnt helping baycot against Reed because they dont want to collapse and create some threepoint shot off the printers PayPal nice screen by Davis got Armando all the way up underneath maybe two phones Applause closed out nicely and theres the foul out leaky on the drive by DQ Nick second on leaky black four on Carolina Music thats going to send Aquarius Nicholas from Atlanta went to Meadow Creek High School to the free throw line transferred in from Southeast Missouri State and Dan this begs the conversation we have with Tim Craft ACC fans are going to become familiar with Luke Terry he transferred from gardnerweb to Georgia Tech craft loss Terry good Georgia Tech another guy to Texas Tech a couple of years ago he lost a guy to another Power five program hes got to replenish with guys in the same way he loses guys and he finds guys like heres a career Reserve at Southeast Missouri State uh uh its placed four years or three years rather at Belmont Avenue wow what youre doing is thats life at the big South level youre its really hard to keep your best players and so youve got to be able to go and find some other players and hes got some transfers with some experience and theyll find out whether theyre as good as the guys that they lost or not Stever number 13 on the floor by the way is a transfer from Wisconsin Green Bay theres Davis he lost the dribble now its a three on one with Nance defending and Robinson cant finish the layup Robinson has gotten a couple of close opportunities he seems to be bothered by the size just take the ball to the basket if they block it theyd lock it Trumbull working off the bounce all the way into traffic blocked by Reed it will stay with parallel Applause the way Tim Craft goes about this hes successful and Dan hes got Lucas Stieber from Wisconsin Green Bay hes got Caleb Robinson thats a Catawba transfer from division two hes found a formula though thats given him some success well in Aldrich Aldrich is a transferred from Belmont Abbey thats division two as well isnt that the key to coaching in any living West to find the formula for your success sure is step out three by love and you know whats the key part of that formula flame coach players yeah good players always helps absolutely absolutely heres the drive Nicholas tried to Bounce It Reed to catch him done six for Kareem Reed Wes in almost every situation when a guard at that and that deep into the lane throws a bounce pass its going off the big guys ankles out of bounds that is a great catch by Kareem Reed Contra Stiles on the floor now for Carolina this is Davis with Nance You Need A Little Fall away and its going Pete Nance has got 16 in the first half when hes showing you everything Wes absolutely terrific first bet for Nance Carolina back to a fivepoint lead and the rebound for Davis Applause Styles Applause back out heres Davis on the drive Runner with the right hand and taken out of their Nicholas on loose ball behind the five dupiah Ludovic doofy alls first basket cuts it to a threepoint game with 3 40 a little bit of sloppy ball handling on the part of the Tar Heels has allowed GardnerWebb to climb back into this thing out of the corner Davis a three Styles tried to keep it alive and GardnerWebb doing a great job on the boards an area of emphasis for Hubert Davis is once again tonight become another focal point another feed and read an easy dunk hes got eight now and gardnerwebly within one with a touch over three to go Nicholas used his quickness to get in there and then his strength to get the ball to Reed Applause its another great play between those two out front spins out a rebound for tomorrow you know I think Wes when youre looking for a basket if your guitar heels you need to at least let bacon touch the ball inside yeah Im not saying You Gotta Throw to him every time or hes got to shoot it every time but the big guy has to be involved Alden seven to shoot Applause in traffic Reeve its backs down on mats Pete tried to contest it did baycot pulls it out of there and down goes bacon and Reed committed his third Music foul on Kareem Reed gets us to break but Carolinas offense is being buoyed by Pete Nance Tar Heels by one Music well and thats sort of been his Habit in his career you cant get those GardnerWebb largely because of what Reeds been able to do with 18 inside points all right the red flag for Hubert Davis here is offensive rebounds Carolinas only got four of them right and they are winning the rebound battle tonight which quite frankly in the first couple of games has been a difficult well the stat gets the important status to score so you know everybody talks about rebounds and all these other things sure as long as you can score points youre okay an offensive foul Baker a demo day badmus stepped right in front first on Armando the fifth on Carolina well I dont mind baycot dribbling the ball but hes dribbling this ball from the threepoint line and I think that thats a recipe for disaster and that file is called because he throws that arm out there 205 to play here in this first half still a onepoint game the other way theyve scored points inside has been driving the ball to the basket tomorrow in particular has done a nice job Applause love that score here is done blockout over there and that was Selden with the rejection now love attacks floater and one how about that for Caleb Lauras first bucket I think love is one of the most effective guards in the confidence when hes able to get in the lane like that he can score in traffic off the dribble this is just a really nice play to get he goes straight up in the air and the defender moves Underneath Him first Applause Music Came Of Love on the board by the way hes now 1317 at the freethrow line and you see DeMarco done fake receipt Seth Trumbull has come back here for what I guess is the last 90 seconds in the first half Applause Music playing with the three guards down there in trouble the rookie with Davis and love they caught in dance foreign dont forget thirsty weve got womens basketball right here on acc networking the ESPN app Don Staley number one South Carolina off the Little John Coliseum Amanda Butler Clemson team waiting both teams undefeated coverage starts at six Thursday night right here on acc Network and streaming live on

to hurry his Dance Now trumpet wheat Nance has been great in this first half Taylor love is he heating up but remiss you know theyre double teaming on Nance on the inside and you have to you cant pass

final stretch if you want to what a double team is thats it right there that was just that looked like the old Carolina running jump Nicholas working against tremble off the Badness screen on the drive Aycock bothered it Nance had it recovered it and saved it to trumpet 17 seconds to go first half Carolina by four and a region foul on DQ Nicholas will be the sixth by my count against Gardner Webb was thats a foul Nicholas drove the ball to the basket lost the ball and I think hes trying to make up for it Carolina going to take the user to lose it 30 and you see Pete Nance being tended too by Doug Halverson the Carolina basketball trainer back after this Music with DirecTV I can get live TV and ondemand together football Housewives football Housewives football Housewives the house lives

what happened here Dan oh he caught it right on the end of the basketball yeah he did but West said do you see what he with one hand falling out of bounds he throws the ball back in and keeps it for the Tar Heels five to shoot in his first half Tyler nickel way out front back rim and out of bounds with O2 now he cant catch it at O2 it has to be a tip so Carolina is going to run to the rim here yeah with point two all you can do is tip if you catch it you catch it in bounds halves over right up gotta tip it Gotta Throw it toward the rim theres the throw theres the Steal yeah so what is he trying to do distract him so they dont know which little finger it is it was the left hand that was uh the one involved in the moment underneath the goal toward the close of the half running bull balls have the basketball to start to second half same starters for both schools that began the game start this second frame Karine reads on the floor playing with three fouls by the way and trying to back down bacon here Nicholas a kick out and a long rebound gathered by love Caleb love and overdrive a little Euro at the Finish wrestling North Carolina can get out and go and thats their first fast break points of the game they are really good because Caleb love just I mean hes impossible to stop when he gets going in transition yep Reed the ball screen theres Aldridge tried to go back door touched out of there on the way to Selden leaky black touched it last but he just does a great job of seeing the defender running back on his heels and a couple of years ago this would have been a walk but its not anymore we legalized that Euro Step thank God kept it alive briefly Clarence Armstrong said touch Last by the Tar Heel big man but what a move by Love In transition Applause ing and the peak of the scores table would have been unhappy with that result there is Selden launching black blocked it trademark stuff from leaky black RJ Davis Caleb love attacking feeds Baker for the dump and the fourth on Reed well Wes thats a combination of a couple of things first of all North Carolina pushes the ball up the court secondly baycott gets position inside and then Caleb love just attacks the defense and Kareem Reed you know he is a veteran player hes got to be smarter than this did no margin in blocking that shot for bacon he got three fouls you just gotta let that one go so a minute 11 seconds into the second half the Bulldogs big man goes to the bench board they caught at the line to complete the threepoint play so the lead is eight plus that basket doesnt happen unless Jay cop gets himself up the court so quickly heres Selden spinning left it on the front rib face out the rebound I was an outlet pass here is love six rebounds for baycott now love a triple got it not immediately gardnerwebs calling a timeout yeah sale of love has opened this half with Five Points but kind of dramatic and impactful points for Hubert Daviss team Tim Craft wants the timeout Tar Heels up 11 points to start this second half impact points right absolutely this is an impact score yeah he just hes a big shot maker when they need a big shot in that run they had last year question normally he was the guy that was able to deliver Carolina Panthers until hes hitting his storage and maybe so in the pantheon Applause heres Nicholas and garden Webb now out of The Craft Time Out training 11 Nicholas went to the deck theres a hill ball thats going to go to Carolina on possession and one thing may have happened tonight that you can say a little bit about the first two games but its been I think much more pronounced here tonight and thats how good Carolines been on defense and right there was the point guard for Gardner Webb Nicholas is driving to the basket and the guy who cuts him off his bacon yeah and bacon moves his feet and Nicholas was looking for a foul and they cut simply didnt file it heres love this is RJ Davis Around the Bangkok spring skipped it from black leaky had it punched out of there nice play by Selden Jr trying to get to the basket on Nance well draw the foul in transition on the floor says Patrick and thatll be number one dance its the first on Carolina we saw Nance do a great job in the first half stepping into the open area that time you didnt yeah and the result was eternal oh he stepped out of bounds foreign ER Webb they turned it over a total of 35 times in their first two games so theyve actually done a better job hanging on to the basketball their problem has been that North Carolina has really been tough on him in the half court tomorrow checks in here and hes going to replace Aldridge for Coach craft and they have gotten the ball inside the Tar Heels have blocked shots Lucas steeper by the way is also playing on that pack Court line theres a three by love and thats the other thing with Caleb love he can get going Carolina on a 10nothing run to start the second half the lead is 14 and love has got eight of them and theres a three Nicholas out of the corner and that is a big basket and thats really what Gardner Webb would like to do is to get those stand still threes from their guys who can shoot him out they drop back into his zone two three Zone here in Florida Bulldog tried to go to Mance cant throw a bounce pass in that situation Lucas steeper the Wisconsin Green Bay transfer and tomorrow going to return the turnover by Carolina with one of his own I dont know he switched so far behind himself that even if self standing there he cant catch it Selden of course was going the other way to craft looks on with Anthony yeah and of course remember we said earlier the former Kansas Star Wayne Sullivan heres paycock and dribble now love Davis with four on the shot clock RJ Davis with eight now thats his second three of the ball game not much you can do defensively about that nope thats good ball movement and you get down to the end with clock and you get a wide open three almost four minutes gone first half tomorrow with the window shot on the three so they didnt make any threes in the first half and they made two here in the last two possessions Nicholas and Julian Samara a moment ago sophomore from the Bronx theres Nance at the high post and Pete Nance 18 points now in the ball game thats his first point to the second half and thats a great play by Nance with that fake that pass fake the defense got totally away from him and went after bacon and he had a wide open opportunity goofy all heres Stever Applause second on Carolina and a moment ago RJ Davis from deep into Western North Carolina on the floor Carolina with an 11point lead Music but in the first half North Carolina has a team shot 29 percent in this half theyve made all their shots theyre shooting nine for excuse me six for six from the field theyre three out of three from Beyond The Arc the only shot theyve missed in the second half was a free throw and one for Wayne Selvin its his first free throw of the year and Wes what anybody will tell you is the game is much easier than the ball goes in the basket gone in the basket here in the second half so far through the target since nay Smith invented it my man it really was a fast thats it heres RJ Davis a little spot up left it on the front first Miss heres Nance to answer lines drive and look at leaky black try and go get it Nicholas came out of there with it Clarence Armstrong is going to whistle Pete Nance for the foul thatll be his second third of the half on Carolina well West the Tar Heels missed their first two shots of the half but they missed good looks shot selection especially here in the second half and I would say Dan for the most part first half felt a little bulky when it came to that department well it did but GardnerWebb is a team theyre going to play hard theyre going to get up and get after you and you know its hard to look efficient against the teammakers there is steeper Nicholas over the top of love I think Caleb might have gotten a piece of that Davis working through the backboard against Nicholas and Carolina on the attack the one thing you cant do if your Gardener web is start forcing things Music AJ Davis sizes up Nicholas haycock the offensive rebound and the foul is going to be on Lucas Stephens Luca Stever by the way 63 Junior transfer from Green Bay he went to Wisconsin Green Bay graduated in about three years he is the nephew of Virginia head coach Tony Bennett Music yeah and the grandson of the Great Hall of Fame coach Dickman right so you better be fundamentally sounding and uninviting to Thanksgiving I was getting ready to say theres no chance you get the holiday meal if uh you cant defend and pass and do all the little things right Music heres paycock black thought about three he was very good on Friday night against College of Charleston from behind the line love Wheels around Williams off the window and in Caleb Love Now 10 in the second half 13 in the ball game Dan and even if his threepointer isnt going down yet he just has a variety of little shots from two yep thats a really nice Runner right there pushes the lead to 12 for the Tar Heels Applause its a very dangerous part of the game so far for him the double Dave Madness working at the Block Nance swatted it out of there in a foul called gonna be three on Pete Nance it is four on Carolina here in the second half six minutes gone and Pete does a nice thing there he after committing the foul wow the foul the foul occurs West right there yeah you know he hits him on the arm as hes going up now the shot block at the end is fine but he hit him across the arm as hes going up to the basket and that was the foul call Applause Music Applause line for the first time this year Mr both now Madness really does not play a lot of minutes they dont look for offense from him and have many opportunities but those were two big ones to miss right there love along two Caleb love is Im telling you when he gets hot he gets very hot hes got 12 here in the second half hes got 15 in the game the lead is 14 and GardnerWebb needs to make sure they get a play here and Armando baycott commits the foul against battles thatll be his second that is already five on Carolina well Hubert Davis a little bit irritated by that particular play because yes you want to put pressure on GardnerWebb but you dont want your big man committing a foul like that beyond the threepointer paper now Caleb Robinson the Cataldo transfer on the floor foreign Applause Music Applause Music Applause Applause lead is 16 foreign dont forget we got a full Saturday of football for you on acc Network well start Saturday morning 11 AM eastern time the ACC huddle crew will be at truest field in the Twin Cities to get you set for another full day Kelsey Riggs filling in for Jordan cornette with emac EJ mangle Eddie Royal and Coach Rick and hey by the way probably be talking about the guy on the left the guy on the left is Drake made the guy on the right was old number 14 his dad Mark May who led the ACC in passing in 1986 however Drakes current number and Marks number that year have almost been tripled games changed a little bit they say but throw the ball a little bit more do they they throw the ball a lot more right now uh Drake is here tonight and so is Mark because Boatman whos actually older than Drake is a junior first year on the Carolina roster with the Huff High School like older brother Luke did break the course at the buyers parking check heres Caleb Robinson on the drive in the dunk for the Catawba transfer in his first point of the night he scored a lot of points at the division two level hes had a problem tonight with the size but that time he was able to beat the big guys out in front Okay well Robinson led the South Atlantic conference had scoring last year as a freshman at Catawba and 18 points a game theres a turnover transition from Quest Albans and Aldridge had Samara going to the corner and tomorrow fell down so the wheels really have to come off here in the second half first seven and a half minutes for Gardner theyve got to dig in defensively forced him Turner who hits an easy basket 14point game it is for Carolina Tyler Nichols in the ball game and heres Davis off the top through the traffic scooped it up and it fell off the Iron Bay cop battled for it Stevers its a really nice job by guarding the web here to out fight Jay Cox in that ball thank you all groups to catch and shoot and he can score from there first points sixth threepointer of the year for Quest Aldridge who grew up in WinstonSalem transferred to Boiling Springs from Belmont Abbey thats not a long commute thats what he wants to do is shoot the three yep hes very good in the catch and shoot yes and thats really the first time hes had the opportunity to move up to the catch and shoot back the Zone here regardless of all trying to shoot over the top Tyler Nichol the rebound back for Caleb love spinning in traffic leaky flat tease a three for less after the way he shot the three the other night and thats another three tonight we may have to revise the scouting report on him a little bit theres no doubt about what he is at the defensive floor it might be Americas best softball Defender but the offensive game has clearly evolved in his career Chapel Hill Aldridge has got the last five here for Gardner Webb but its still a 12point tar heel lead Applause nickel back to Man to dance left hand stripped of it on the way up and a foul called by Pat Driscoll from underneath and well take a break with him foul on dupial but leaky black from behind the line here in the corner Carolina lead is 12 at Smith Center Music didnt make a three but in the second half hes been really good in transition hes made five field goals two of them threepoint field goals Wesson in addition to that hes got three assists in the second half so he has really dominated plays with the trial and when hes playing like that North Carolina is Pretty Tough Armando baycott been to the line once tonight and missed that opportunity hes got four points to go with seven rebounds 61 free throw shooter coming into the night Applause scoring and love scoring theres only so many points to go around Mondo for a second sixth now for bacon had nine double doubles last year at 31 of these Seasons Applause with 20 or more points though think about that point Applause almost halfway home tend to shoot for Alders whos in trouble fails to Nicholas trying to work against Andre Davis and missed everything now he was looking for a foul thats just a fourth shot and thats not what GardnerWebb needs theres love nice pass Bay caught up strong Reed gets the rebound Kareem Reed on the floor out of the timeout by the way playing with the fourperson well you normally see big memes that was a great catch on the pass by love theres a lob and a catch and to push up by Reed fifth field goal Kareem Reed 10 points Wes Im telling you I think hes extremely important for this gardnerweb team just to have his presence on the inside and he has somehow got to get that fouling under control he just fouled out of the game yep sure did so Reed is going to be disqualified and I double checked this earlier today yes yes this is the fourth time only the fourth time hes been disqualified in his career and tonight is his 92nd game but yet historically last year he seemed to play with three or more fouls in every game now this is just a situation where hes got his arm wrapped around Baker that left arm is around Bakers waist and the officials standing right there looking at it baycott is pushing him as well but the foul was clearly on Reed that he just has to stay in the game Badness checks back in at the dim of the day has played a lot tonight because it reads foul trouble and Love is feeling but West the point there is you cannot defend that Nicholas Nicholas Nicholas was actually in pretty good position but you theres no defense against that play David Wells got 17 theres the drive and and the basket thats DQ Nicholas and the score Val is on RJ Davis it will be his second that is six on Carolina Wes Ive been impressed with Nicholas tonight hes shown good strength hes got the ability to get to the basket I think the problem with Nicholas hes got to be careful he doesnt try to try to do too much and that doesnt need to put the team on his shoulders Terry Danny barely though with like a Nicholas and Aldridge coming in as as transferred you see Nicholas miss the frequent its got to be a little bit of continuity issue but you got to work through if youre Tim Craft between now no its not a big Southwest theres no question theres a hand check and thats Nicholas out on the perimeter and Wes heres the other point to make that when youre playing the Big South if youre gardnerweb you have one path and one path only to the NCAA tournament that is you have to win the Big South tournament yep and so Tim Craft you know you want to come into these games you want to play well in these games you want to win these games but the main thing youve got to do is put your team together because youre not going to earn your way to the NCAA tournament didnt go there theres traffic youll skip for black you see the Bulldogs pick for finished fourth in the big sound black knocks the field goals on hes got seven Longwood whitwick UNC Asheville company Applause rejected its all Pete Dance all four of his fouls in the second half dang it so hes got four with 836 to play and that is seven now on Carolina well we talked about Selden hes a big strong guy and hes able to get to the basket and Nance just hit him on the left arm but Selden Selden has thats 10 points now in the game for Sheldon but for the most part tonight hes been guarded by leaky black and thats I mean its hard for anybody to play against leaky black Justin McCoys first action of the year the young man who transferred over for Virginia played 30 Games a season to go and averaged about seven minutes I only had five double figure with both reforms hes got 11 on the ball Carolina lead is still 12 with eight and a half to go Tar Heels still searching for their first points from the bench tonight McCoy the latest candidate and so is tremble who fires based on and the ball got deflected over the Bulldogs itll stay with the target I really havent had a lot of minutes from the bench right on either way into the corner for leaky black to put in his blood but Hubert Davis is doing the same thing with Kent Kraft is and that hes trying to put the pieces together this is a team yes they returned an awful lot of their Firepower foot last years team but they have new guys as well and you got to fit all those pieces together no Ive missed the ball three and Dan I think thats something that is basketball fan we have traditionally taken for granted yes if you bring back guys automatically as you see Garden Warehouse loses it driving it around well take a break come back but the expectation level and understanding how to process it with a new team next defense leads Carolina and scoring Michaela loveman star of the second half game Pete Nance got him going in the first half and Caleb love has really been the standout as you said here in the second half and Wes its really been interesting North Carolina they still dont have any points from the bench yeah and the bench we talked about it only 28 minutes from the bench so far tonight the starters have played more than 130 minutes so and again for North Carolina obviously they have the path to the NCAA tournament only winning race is a championship but getting in that large pitch but its still for Hubert Davis its the same task as it is for Tim Craft and that is you have to figure out how to put the pieces together well in the kind of the mentality involved in that process was what we were talking with Coach Davis about today and I thought his discussion about the outside boys was as interesting as what he was talking about him just building his team from within his locker room in his gym he said last year with the employees were dealing thats a lot of negativity and this year its really high expectations yeah ranked the number one team in the country everybody figures and again we joked about it before everybody figures they should win all their games by 30 40 points right Applause you know people forget everybody talks about okay Grady manic is gone but they forget that until Dawson Garcia left the program right Brady manic did not have the kind of opportunities that he did later on in the year couldnt finish but McCoy got a hand in there defensively Carolina back with it heres love thats just Bay cop and that got blocked and a foul is called either on Selden or Stephen and its going to be on Anthony Selvin it will be his first thats the fifth the big cup does a great job catching the ball s so Armando to the line the repair hes two of three at the stripe has six points tonight four here in the second half and the first one good quick reminder to you that we got week 12 of uh ACC football coming your way weve also got basketball for you coming up Monday night Dannon Ill be in Tallahassee for Mercer in Florida State meanwhile bellamon visits number seven Duke we get started at 6 30 right here on acc network streaming live on the ESPN app Blue Devils are in the Wings To Face Kansas tonight in Indianapolis because Michigans state Kentucky yes yes Michigan State and Kentucky are holding up the college football playoff show just so you know I cant say thats a big concerned that is for some folks yeah absolutely Music patrons if you will tomorrow Baseline got trapped Steve a nice pass for seldens three good ball Movement by Ted crabs team and Steve is a guy that keeps the ball moving it doesnt stick in his hands Applause Garner Webb theyve shown the ability to shoot for three West when they have time in the catch and shoot situation left point game heres RJ Davis Applause small away pounds away the two Nicholas turns it over and last touch that says Clarence Armstrong by RJ Davis another look you get the ball down inside and then the pass out you could see the defense reacting to Stieber and he just gets rid of it right away and creates a wide open opportunity and Selden is the guy he likes to shoot the three and when he has time and distance he can make it Bulldogs have hit six of the last eight from the floor and see whats reflective tonight score 14 from three and turned over but Carolina couldnt take advantage of it itll stay with gardnerweb with 18 to shoot Applause unless thats one of the situations where Selden lost the ball in the dribble and I think that was Davis over there whos trying to pick it up by dribbling it thats the thing coach always tell you grab the ball first and then dribble Applause Music Lake Carolina the bonus Bulldogs are already there in fact theyve been through eight minutes Applause Julian Samara was almost sitting over there in the lap of the assistant Jeremy Luther when he cut that loose back to an eightpoint lead heres tremble hanging two good first match points for Carolina go to Seth Trumbull thats a really nice play he passed up to three he got a better shot Selden working against baycot with a right hand tough shot Carolina lead again working on steeper with the twopoint jump shot baycott slapped it out Davis had a shot at it here is tomorrow and hell roll it in Julian Samara has eight in the half 12 to the Ballgame one off his average which leads gardnerwillman scoring and its a sixpoint game with five to play Hubert Davis is really upset because he feels like gardnerweb out hustled his guys that time they would love sizes up Nicholas spinning into traffic gets it to McCoy I can shoot for Davis deep three missed everything seldom the recovery for gardnerwill 4 35 to play front three ball sends off for duffyoff yes Im not sure in that situation thats the shot they wanted Trumbull heres love catch and shoot front rim Miss Stever the rebound foreign just ahead of four minutes to play in the game Stephen Nicholas the traffic forced it up and thats exactly the right word West yeah tremble pressured in the back court by Nicholas and now Carolina will take the time out to get Nance and black back on the floor down to a sixpoint game through tonight the sixth meeting Carolina leads five nothing they first played in 2005 that was a threepoint game the last meeting was 16 points three years ago Cole Anthony had 28 for Carolina ten years ago they played James Michael McAdoo hit 26 and 14 to lead Carolina and heres tonights game summary Dan well and the interesting thing there is North Carolina see GardnerWebb they missed their first three but since then theyre 12 for 18 North Carolina made their first sixth field goal attempts and since then theyre seven for 20 foreign for the Tar Heels Nance would tend to shoot against Selden and an offensive foul called on Pete Nance and thats five thatll be five for Pete Nance and he will foul out with 18 points at the 338 Mark well Wes this is important to know this is a point of emphasis for the officials when you drop that shoulder and drive into a guy thats automatic you know he hits him right in the chest with his shoulder and what that you know what the officials in their training videos If Nance is pumping into him using using backside and thats one thing but as soon as he turns perpendicular and lowers that shoulder and runs in to sell and thats an offensive foul now Selden did a heck of a job thats a good call Nance is fouled out with three and a half to go in a sixpoint game and Davis almost stole the pass intended for DQ Nichols and thats thats not a good pass by Stever because Nicholas is not a threepoint shooter now if youre trying to get that ball over to tomorrow thats different but really nice job by North Carolina to react to that play Sullivan Ruthie all trying to help with the screen fake hot there Sullivan at the right hand and black got it more Selden came a problem Applause Music Applause Davis now heres love ahead of three minutes to go and we get a reach and a foul and that will be number seven on the Bulldogs the foul is on Julian Samara the rest of his first it was interesting in the first half neither team members right theyre all in another total foul score Applause here is love and this is a oneonone is now 14 of 18 thats the line in this young season now has 18 points mans fouled out with a team Applause and now here is DQ necklace seven point game and Tim Craft has grinded this thing all the way down to where they got a question off the Stever fish now its just a great job you moved the defense around you forced baycot to guard the screen and roll and then Steven just makes a great pass goofy all I beg youre far in his second field going off the lift from Steven so its a fivepoint game skip back for leaky black catching shoot spins out look at that went halfway down bounces out for him 220 to go Selvin the Nicholas and as a result he allows the defense to recover 15 to shoot trying to beat McCoy now here is Stever its black with 10 to shoot attack for Samara McCoy there drive skip out for dupial offensive foul Julian Samara player control no free throws on the second and against savaro thats really a nice job by RJ Davis to get in there heres the screen and roll and the thing that did that that created that opportunity was great ball movement but here tomorrows really forcing it and Davis just steps in as long as hes got his position established before Samara leaves the floor then thats a charge Applause 155 to go love attacking all the way to the basket ran into traffic heres Gardner Webb with Samara in transition missed the layup fake off the rebound what a great job Dave by bacon down the court and by Davis to make that a difficult shot and rebounds with Babcock Carolina holding to a fivepoint lead with 90 seconds to go I think Gardner have had a couple of chances Russ Carroll Island 4731 Davis a two and hes fouled Music hold on RJ Davis still alive Wes you get excited when youre on defense but youre gonna try to jump straight up in the air and there was Bob Duffy all didnt he went right at the game she got to give the guy room to come down two shots for RJ Davis is in foreign Ill be in Louisville with Roddy Jones and Taylor Davis for NC State in the cards and then ACC Primetime football from truest field in WinstonSalem Syracuse and Wake Forest in the Atlantic division Davis hits them both five and a half 10 in the ball game now second career DoubleDouble his first DoubleDouble was last year against Kansas in the national championship game ball last Touch by Carolina the state of Gardner Webb Tar Heels up seven now with 72 seconds here president again Nicholas I think really tried to force the ball Applause wow its very fortunate with black and couldnt control the car Nicholas Trimble stole the inbounds pass headed for Samara Petty play by the young freshman there Dan weve got the three guards fake hot and black on the floor now for Hubert Davis here in the final minute RJ Davis going to work against DQ Nicholas looking for some help and Nicholas does a terrific job forcing Davis into a long two thats good Nicholas did everything he could Dan Im not sure if youre in North Carolina you put that one in the play but hell take the result its a heck of a shot by RJ Davis and Carolina pushes it to nine with 45 and a half seconds left Applause very quietly RJ Daviss DoubleDouble tonights going to feature some big baskets and this is a good basket right here you know the things right there is hes hes in a hurry and then hes able to collect himself watch this he just stops gets himself in good position and shoots the ball lots of times guys theyll be going fast and theyll continue to go fast and as a result theyll take a bad shot or throw it away but thats really great discipline by Davis to get himself stopped composed and then knock it down might be a tough time for the floor by his standard but 12 points 10 rebounds three assists in 34 minutes tonight for junior RJ Davis you dont have to make all the shots but it helps when you make the big shots and that was a big shot but he made a couple of big free throws when gardnerweb was coming back in the game Applause 15 down in seconds Applause Music Applause and I just got a couple to go clearly this is a must score situation regarding the web Applause course putting his hand and then try to put Bangkok Music or you wanted to go to Samara dont you find somebody I want to go to somebody theres tomorrow with a deep screen tomorrow launches over the top of leaky black and thats going to run it down and Ludovic goofy all commits the top so love will March down to the other end and free throws coming for Carolina on the 10th against GardnerWebb shooting over leaky black is generally not a form of efficient sex so Caleb loves to enjoy Music Applause Caleb loved to the line you may be wondering okay GardnerWebb in Carolina yeah they have a sequence of games but this latest series is in part because Tim Craft Not only was an assistant at Gardner Webb the first time they came here he also was an assistant with the former Tar Heel and current Huber Davis assistant Jeff Lebo at both East Carolina and Auburn Applause of course East Carolina to run the Gardner program theres in Carolina foul and there you see coach Kraft to the far left actually sitting next to Jeffs dad Dave Lebo and Coach Lebo in the middle and then hes graduation day at East Carolina theres a picture when they were together with the Tigers foreign not to interrupt but Wes thats how a lot of games like this get made in teams like Gardner Webb theyre looking for games its the free throw hes got 18 now in the ball game and boy Anthony Sullivan nice player and big and strong Im not afraid Community from the Tilton School of New Hampshire from Boston and Luke call a timeout Carolina Im not able to execute the inbound pass cleanly against pressure so rather than turn it over Tar Heels will bang a timeout James Madisons here on Sunday noon game on acc Network Dan will be here for that with Mike Monaco and then off to the uh Phil Knight Invitational out west important to Dan Portland the first game and then either Iowa State or Villanova but get serious yeah it does right I mean were seeing a couple of those games tonight obviously in Indianapolis in the Champions classic interesting to watch it evolve here a little bit as the teams start to buy in weve seen what great game the other night with Gonzaga and Michigan State things like that but everybodys trying to kind of get to the same objective yeah Wes and again were talking about a team from the ACC a team like North Carolina your formula for getting into the tournament is the NCAA tournament is you win all the games youre supposed to win and then you win a representative number of games like this with teams that are on your same level and that helps you with your seed it helps you with your net and if your confidence can do the same thing and everybodys got a solid net then when you get into conference play youre playing quote unquote quad one and quad two beats and that helps the entire conference yep looking for his first double double of the Year leads a rebound thank you goodbye and heres the career count look at this list thats a heck of everybody Cunningham Jameson baycod hansgrove and Samuel Bruce Perkins from Latham New York well West Side I had a lot of double doubles but you can only get five fouls without turnovers and fouls free throws my other best area was headshots bad shots blocked yeah 20 seconds to go to 11 point lead nice drive tomorrow eight point half for a 10point half for tomorrow 14 in the ball game and theres a backboard foul and Aldridge Applause and free throws coming down here with 18 seconds left for Tim Krauss well for GardnerWebb West they they battled all night long they did a nice job they were worried about turnovers but they theyve only turned it over what nine times after turning it over 35 times total in their first two games its a trembled two of three at the line on this young season goes out Applause so Trimble averages Four Points a game between 13 minutes coming in hes now got three here tonight 104 again Applause so the Dukes will be here on Sunday and then off to the West for Carolina threepointer tomorrow adds to his tally and another foul with 71 to go into seven point game crowd doesnt like it they just want to go ahead and zombies Music and well get a couple of free throws here to get us into the final second thats a really nice job by Samara to get his feet in position for that shot yeah and again Im really impressed with Stever he really gets the ball movement and makes some nice passes heres RJ Davis and person good by the way Gardner Webb is at Wofford on Friday night for Richardson Indoor Stadium in Spartanburg this is the third of seven straight road games Dan theyre playing to start the season their first home game is against Chattanooga who by the way is one of the favorites in the Southern Conference final second to the game at the horn the three ball is good for selda but Carolina beats GardnerWebb for a sixth time and the Tar Heels do it tonight 7266 Dan Hubert Davis his guys played well defensively for most of the night they had some offensive struggles though Carolina goes to 30 thanks to our producer Matt Krause our director Kyle Lang Chelsea Riggs and Dallin cup this might be the most emotionally charged match of the modern era Music Applause
