9 which was his second year the first time at Chapel Hill to find the last time he lost the Duke Tyson Chapman will watch it go overhead and here comes Carolina to scrimmage from it 25 and all our heel discussion start with the red shirt sophomore from Huntersville North Carolina Drake M you see obviously hes thrown for a bunch of yards this year really hes played well all season long did not play great against Virginia but I think other than that has been absolutely as advertised but hes facing a really good defense tonight especially with that front four and front seven for Duke you saw the 380 and three scores including the gamewinner to Antoine green last year at wles w stadium in his only game experience against the Blue Devils Carolina in a two back set to start May going to get it on the perimeter and heres amarian Hampton breaking for four before he is slung out of bounds by Nick Morris the linebacker now Duke plays tonight without Dorian mausi the linebacker were going to see Hampton and British Brooks in the back field we did on that first snap and amarian picked up right at about five on the play second and six really nice catch by Hampton the ball thrown behind I hes a complete back terms of how he catches the football how much speed he has you can see why they like giving it to him second play for the Tar Heels heres May dumps it out of the back field again Hampton the catch and hes going to give some ground back he gets back to the line of scrimmage and maybe a step more but Duke played that very well in their defensive front so its third and five here Tim in Carolinas on the football Dukes trying to make some changes here well and going fast while Duke tries to make some changes and Duke obviously doesnt like what they see and they have to take a timeout all right so a little bit of the gamesmanship here we talked about with m brown yesterday time out dude first charge time out time out itll be 30 seconds one of the things chip Lindsay likes to do is just go ahead and fast ball on third down get up and and you know run a play so you cant get a complicated defensive call in you see Mike ELO obviously a defensive minded coach and you know he cant be pleased that on the first third down of the game hes forced to use a timeout back Brown we told you 12 straight wins against Duke 1989 the last time he has fallen in this game as the Tar Hill head coach Mike Elko by the way a win tonight would move into 10th place on Dukes alltime wins list tying red Wilson who gued the Blue Devils from the late 70s to the early 80s British Brooks back in the ball game now with May out of the Timeout on third down and you see Carolina needs four full to keep the drive alive May up in the pocket going to throw and it is caught is that Nesbit it is the tight end Bryson Nesbit we werent sure if he would play tonight and how effective he would be falling down converts the third its a great job of Drake may just sticking with Nesbit and let him work the option route and find find a way to get him the football and this is British Brooks playing in his final game at Keenan Stadium across the 40 yd line on first down and you go back to that third down play West youre going to see what I mean May is ready to throw it to him but hes not ready for the football nesb isnt and cam Dylan is applying some pressure on him hes able to climb and then get the football off thats pretty good pocket awareness by Drake M Hampton come back in the ball game after Brooks got the call on first down quick throw by May Walkers first catch of the night out on the perimeter against Chandler Rivers the sophomore corner and itll be measured A Step Beyond the 45 so third and short coming for Carolina and Drake Mays numbers of the third down Tim are terrific quick snap going to hand the ball to Marian Hampton lowers the shoulder and going to depend on the spot he needed to break I think the 4 seven Nick Morris has already been in on about half the first snaps of Carolinas possession at linebacker for theyre going to give him the first Applause down you see Carolina making changes here Kamari Morales spells Nesbit at the tight end spot now Duke with hola almost like a line change up front for def defensive coordinator Tyler santui I dont know if its power play or penalty kill youll have to help me later on look like a power play heres to the near side Hampton flipped over maybe got a step but not much more Al blades Jr the Miami transfer whos had 18 total tackles in the last three makes the play yeah listen you get a big 220 lb back get to the perimeter its a nice job of just kind of sawing off the legs by Al blades hes really been a nice player for Duke this season and heres Anthony Nelson coming off the field and because Carolina sub Duke has time to make the change snap to May hes going to take a shot Walker is his Target and makes the catch Taz Walker with blades defending and may dropped it in a bucket listen we just said Al Blaze has been a really good player but TZ Walker has been an unbelievable player and it the size and speed combination and an ability to trck the football is so special Carolina around the 10 yd line out on the perimeter the throw is made and Breaking Free toward the goal line is Applause Nesbit down to the three goes Bryson nbut after a 43 yd catch by TZ Walker yeah yeah yeah tar Hills in the hurry up Hampton is with May and may will keep it and Carolina gets the early lead on the opening Applause drive pretty impressive drive by Drake May in the Tar Hill offense but their Tempo definitely was something that I think had Duke on their heels a bit and and obviously go fast down near the goal line Zone Reed no one accounts for the quarterback and its a walk in for Drake Drake Mays seventh rushing score of the year the point from Bernett is good Duke had some early success with pressure but Carolina got the big strike well they got the big strike because they got TZ Walker who just wins on a go route and then Drake Mays ability to throw accurately down the field and then the athleticism come down in the Red Zone has the well so the game is on Drake May one of the college footballs finest quarterbacks is perfect on the opening drive he keeps it for a Oney run and now the old defensive coordinator is the seconde head coach of the Blue Devils and Mike Elco I think he in many ways inv visiting with him yesterday Embraces this challenge Tim tonight against May and the Tar Heels theres no question he Embraces it I think he knows what hes up against in terms of how good Carolina is offensively but feels good about his defense its his quarterback situation Wes that I think is a little tricky yeah the end of the Notre Dame game was heartbreaking in a couple of different ways Henry Bean did a terrific job getting a win against NC State Riley Leonards comeback though was stemmed reinjured at Florida State couldnt really be effective at Louisville and then 10 days ago this guy GNE South Carolinas Grayson lus comes in in his first start and does big things top Pino wanted at the horn on the field goal but lus managed a very nice game for the Blue Devils on offense and on first down Jordan Waters to work picks up about four on first down but we get a look at Grayson Loftus Tim for the first time and and Kevin Johns told us in our earlier visit with Duke he had a really good spring he improved his footwork and now hes the guy and you know he is a true freshman but he was a midyear en rolly so he was there for the spring got to compete with Henry Bean for the backup job to Riley Leonard and they have actually been pleased with what theyve gotten out of them they have to manage some of the known passing situations tonight though second down after the run by Waters and loftuss first throw of the night pops out of the hands of Jordan Moore at the Carolina bench Armani Chapman was there for Carolina defensively and a pretty good throw by Loftus to start accurate Ball but its Chapman with really good tight coverage able to get his hand in there and Duke now going fast on third down Blue Devils were five of 14 against Wake Forest heres Loftus taking a shot far side and overthrows Samir Hain and the Blue Devils are going to go three and out on their opening possession yeah and thats not what Mike Elco wants is you know he does not want quick drives and giving the ball back quickly to Drake May and I think if Grayson lus could have that back you just give his receiver a chance to play the footb talking with Kevin Johns the outstanding offensive coordinator for the blue doues Elijah huzzy Waits on the putt of Porter Wilson first in the ACC in net hes second nashal in that category and there is Elijah huz whats at stake tonight in this rivalry well the old Victory BT much discussed much celebrated goes to the winner tonight Music back to work lets visit with Taylor tanal yeah guys well it didnt take long for Drake May to drive the field and score the opening touchdown of this game you saw before the game 30 seniors being honored here today on Senior Day Drake May was not one of them he is not a senior and thats why he didnt want to walk out there and enjoy the festivities with his family even though head coach m brown gave him the option because you guys this is likely most likely his finale here at Keenan Stadium as he is expected to be a one or two overall pick in next years NFL Draft all of those expectations he has around them are big but this guy remains humble guys yeah certainly does 7 nothing on the May one yd run to cap Carolinas first possession the throw here is complete and this is McCollum Nate McCollum who earlier this year had 15 catches against Minnesota to announce his presence had only hit six in the last three games prior to this one and I really think hes the player that could really change the dynamic there goes Hampton I just think mcllin can change the dynamic of Carolina offensively we know Hamptons going to be a physical Runner you know youre going to get the big plays from TZ Walker can you find that and finally brought down by Stenson whos a pretty good safety for Mike ELOs defense you just see how Hamptons hard to tackle just just good power good Applause balance averaging six on his first four carries and here goes another one for about seven Jeremiah Lewis grad safety from Lewisville Texas have a stop you just go back to the previous play I mean just guys bouncing off of him running with good leverage good balance and Jeremiah Lewis just not able to to get him down and not often that the first guy gets him down fourth in FBS first in the ACC in rush yards per game made a throw and boy he got batted away at the line of scrimmage Duke had a lot of white shirts around it Michael Reese Junior from Nashville I think was the guy that got a hand up there did pretty good move on Spencer Rollin and hes able to kind of sneak inside and get his hand up you see the third down move here theres Hampton and made a throw quick shot copenh with the catch first down Carolina Tim I I know theres a lot going on for a quarterback at any snap but it just really seems he plays with a lot of poison well he does and then just look at copenhaver he basically is uncovered trying to play some type of 2D but I think Trey Freeman needs to go out and match here is Hampton at the 10 and itll be first and goal Carolina Lewis may have saved the Applause touchdown so Carolina on another Red Zone trip on their second Applause possession and Hampton again through the a gap stopped at the one one of the things I like that Carolina does is lot of these are rpos you know Drakes got the ability to throw the football on them and sometimes even versus a bad run look because you have Hampton because of where youre on the field well just continue to give him the football and may going to sneak this and finally the whistle blows but this will be where they project the spot around that goal line Mike ELO wants to know the same kind of thing I believe and I almost think that chip Lindsay Carolina maybe thought that they were a little bit closer man that look like the one and A2 yd Line West I mean typically outside the one especially with a back like Hampton I dont know that thats necessarily QB sneak territory territory here comes everybody lined up to shove and there goes the shove but Im not sure that may got in fact he didnt its Fourth Down Tim I know a lot of people are thinking this is the way to go in todays modern football and I see it Mis executed more than I see it executed listen we see Philadelphia the Philadelphia Eagles be amazing at it but the other aspect of it is when you have a 64 quarterback you know maybe its not quite the same trayon greens come in as an extra tackle now NES comes in here comes look at with this nesbet ran on late caught the pass their Flags everywhere was nesbet in motion Dwayne Carter pounded may as he cut it Loose I I have no idea where theyre going with this it could be a couple of different things Jeff Music Flanigan illegal substitution on the offense number 18 thats a 5y yard penalty fourth down so nbits coming onto the field Carolina wants to be in an unbalance formation and have Nesbit be the tight end here Here Comes Nesbit running on the field this is not Canada no wonder hes so wide open look the reality the good thing for Carolina is that Drake May makes a remarkable play with somebody in his face to get the football off to nesbet so that the penalty is accepted he can play pass obviously Duke would have been able to decline it Noah Bernett for the field goal 23 yd try is good and a little bit awkward with Hamptons already averaging 72 yards on seven carries and Jordan Waters only got it on the first down play on Dukes opening drive and now the the play number Tim already 21 snaps for Carolina just three for Duke out yeah thats not the formula for Duke Duke really wants to control the game the exact opposite is happening right Music now Liam Boyd former soccer player transfer from Clemson Kicking It Away Terry Moore deep to the Blue Devils and Grayson Loftus and Duke will start from its 25 dont forget the Huddle crew is here with us live in Chapel Hill been here all day and when were done theyll give you a full recap of week 11 in the ACC all the highlights analysis much much more coming up from Keenan Stadium right here on the Huddle on acc Network and always streaming live for you on the ESPN Clemson Virginia Tech NC State Florida State Syracuse all winners today in the ACC off the 25 heres lus tight endend and three receivers in the set for it and Jordan Waters got two before Cedric gray who had 18 tackles in the lost to Virginia has three games of double fig stops this fall makes the play one of the things that Duke does a nice job of is and being patient with their double teams but when youre really patient with your double teams it allows those linebackers to be aggressive and Cedric does that there and hes made a lot of tackles this season hasnt he 85 of them coming into tonight 333 tonight his 49th Collegian game play clock winding down on LOF this to one gets it snapped and flag is thrown it will be a delay of game against Applause Duke offense 5yd penalty second down I know Mike Elco talked with us yesterday extensively about slow the game down see if you couldnt you know when his teams on defense reduce their space a little bit of what they try to do from a attack standpoint but offensively that slow things down is the premium here tonight Tim it is and the pre snap penalties because of a delay thats not what Duke needs offensively with how theyre operating heres Waters banging across the 30 look at Jordan Waters and hell get the first down wat terrific effort by Waters and his mates up front on a 14 yd play like felt like crowd surfing at the end of this thing you see Jordan Waters just continuing to drive and look at that movement you know we talked so much about Amari and Hampton and rightfully so because of his power Jordan Waters is strong hes got a thickness to his build and he is a good powerful tough runner at 1435 career yards in his Duke career Fairmont North Carolina First and 10 lus back across the middle incomplete he was looking in the neighborhood of hazley the tight end I wonder if he thought hazley was going to kind of Bounce out because that was a bit of a misfire hes working to his right then has a shallow cross coming into his line of vision I think hazley was the next intended target but ball was pretty far off the Mark Jeremiah had a touchdown catch in the win against NC State his tight EPS been challenged by Nikki Dal molan missing some time this regular season with injury as well well hes back in the lineup though for the second straight game Applause tonight this is jaquez Moore making a move spinning across the 40 got to the 41 and he got slung B Cayman Rucker Senor from har Jan leads Carolina in scks tackles for loss and quarterback hes yeah now empty and quick Tempo on third down to get a look at the defense Duke is got four different guys over there two with the do BB on and another guy were in Green MO stays in the back field Carolina trying to get there long throw caught Jaylen Calhoun terrific grab and a really well thrown ball from lofas for the dke first down it really was it was a nice route by coun he basically is the inside and hes going to kind of Bend this out just watch the anticipation because the balls coming out now turns around the right to the face mask thats really well done by Grayson Loftus and West for a quarterback often times that can just like get you going the first good throw that you have where you feel like all right now Im in this football game now Im seeing it now Im feeling it its a good sign for Duke offensively more and Waters together with less in the back field now and its Jordan Waters trying to work his way here to the near side good run Pursuit by the Tar Heel maybe a yard maybe not stick Lane and Cedric gray the tackle for Carolina yeah watch stick Lane kind of run the alley here this gets kind of extended a little bit as you see gray kind of bounce it out and then next thing you know here comes stick Lane playing downhill Through the Alley thats pretty good good tackle from the secondary Carolinas number one on defense Lane is only listed at 59190 started his career at Georgia State but he hits like he weighs more than 190 probably how you get the nickname stick sound like a guy that might have been stuck a couple times second and 10 and Jaylen Coleman in the lineup for Duke now and hell get three maybe on the play theyll certainly be got two for sure Jordan Waters has come out of the game not a good sound oh thatd be tough for the Blue Devils but Jaylen Coleman a grad student from Matthews North Carolina makes his debut against Carolina tonight in a Duke jersey third down and eight lus in trouble scrambling back up field and hell be stopped from behind at the Tar Hill 46 by Rucker thats just great effort by Cayman Rucker because grah Bon at left tackle whos a really nice player does a a good job this is the matchup out here but just watch The Pursuit and effort by Rucker pretty good job of Barton staying with him does an excellent job but then its that pursuit of just sticking with it by Cayman Rucker that prevents a big scramble on third down so heres Porter Wilson now and Elijah huzzy stands at the 10 for Music Carolina Wilson airs this out itll reach the end zone and the tar Hills will have the ball and a 10 nothing lead at their 20 yd line in the final half minute of the opening quarter here chavel Hill old house at Keenan Stadium seeing which team keeps at least a potential hope alive Louisville would have to lose next Saturday in Miami to open the door for the winner of this game here tonight and some of these other two lost teams in the ACC including Virginia T who won big today at Boston College off the 20 Hampton cannot break free and thats Terry Moore coming down from safety to make a terrific play on the Tar Hill running so to speak right Tim I mean a little different than finding out 3 4 days ahead of the weight game heres Hampton on first down with Carolina taking over at its 20 and Al blades Jr wraps him up you Mike ELO talked about you know having to get a stop here I would agree with him in Carolina again third down as duke tries to sub going quickly tar Hills have three to the field for May and Walker in the boundary against blades theyve hit three of their first four Carolina is first in the ACC and seventh nashley at 51 coming in May a long throw nzb but another catch and up the near sideline for what is a Carolina first down Jaylen Stinson shoves him out of bounds and for a guy who is questionable Bryson ns been pretty good he been really good I seeing him warm up I wasnt sure how effective hed be but so far so good yep first and 10 thear Hill 35 and Hampton back to work straight ahead and across the 40 picks up seven Nick Morris the tackle for the Blue Devils watch Drake May here on this previous third down he just hes trying to work down the middle of the field then the in Cut doesnt like it its able to get all the way outside he just some quarterbacks just have a scope of Vision West thats not narrow you know they just see more of the field and I think its one of the things that makes him such a special player Tim the Carolina media folks have told told me there are as many representatives from NFL teams here tonight as theyve seen in the month of November in the last decade well in number 10 big part of it is a really big part of it yep heres the give Hampton Breaking Free Duke secondary and its Freeman the linebacker who finally gets him on the ground inside the Blue Devil 45 this is really well blocked to the guys up front do a nice job of passing it off and Ed montilus pretty good patience too duks having all kinds of issues substituting heres May to his left trying to lead Jones What A Catch JJ Applause Jones what a grab by JJ Jones Jeff Flanigan will tell us about the flags substitution defense p L play first down well Mike elro cant believe it I think he thought that he had a chance to sub look at the pace of substituting I mean Duke is nowhere near ready and Mike ELO is sideways about it I think he felt like he should have been given an opportunity to sub thinking that Carolina heads up two tights for the Tar Heels off the Blue Devil 13 and Hampton willll get a yard to the 12 you know I guess lost in the madness is that JJ Jones somebody that they really want to kind of Step Up they feel like hes got big time ability size and speed does a good job of using both right there yep only a yard for Hampton on the Applause ground second down and nine and Lukes red zone defense which is number one in the accs already held Carolina on first and goal to a field goal opportunity heres May to his right and in trouble slings it out underhanded and that ball is ruled incomplete Aaron Hall The 277 lb defensive tackle from Southern Durham was the guy forcing May well Drake avoids a sack and and I think that Mike Elco wanted grounding there yeah he does want grounding here look the ball does not get back to the line of scrimmage now you can kind of argue that theres a player in the area not really I think I would agree with Mike ELO that that probably should have been grounded British Brooks has joined May in the back field heres another third down temp for the tarel at Applause distance May looking left pressure coming and now throws toward the back of the end zone and out of bounds and may got chased all the way to the Carolina bench by Dylan and then took a shot as he let it go that was really good pass rush by multiple guys on that Duke front to put on pressure put pressure on May quickly and Wes one thing you know with this this Duke defense is theyll just continue to come after you yep Tyler santui does a great job Jess Simpson the D line coach is terrific for Mike ELO and the point by Bernett hes good 31y yd field goal for brette Duke gets a red zone and thats what theyre playing for tonight since the late 4S the Bell from a railroad car has become the symbol for the winner of Duke Carolina in Applause football Terry Moore more Waits on Liam Boyds kick and heres more two yds deep now at the 15 comes to a stop bends it middle of the field and Out near the 30 goes Terry Moore so the victory bell has uh been around since the late 40s came from the old railroad train it was bought by the business manager at Duke because Duke had the money in the budget the idea was conceived by the cheerleading captains so the winner gets the Bell and it is a much celebrated much debated moment in the Music series for a series that dates all the way back to late November 1888 in Raleigh of all places they played for the first time Dukes third possession begins off its 30 lus and Jordan Waters gets five gets seven and delivers some punishment on the way out of bounds Marcus Allen I think got the bad end of that deal at the Blue Devil bench a lot of players get the bad end of that deal when Jordan Waters is coming in his Direction good stiff arm job of getting the perimeter and then good finish and a good sign for Duke that after seeing him kind of unsure with how he felt that hes back looking healthy Marcus Allen the sophomore corner from the Atlanta area Applause so heres second and three a tight end three receivers and the running back with Applause lus and Waters again Blue double first down and about three more yards to the 43 Elijah huzzy makes the stop you see winning on first down which they clearly did with the big waters run just it it changes everything I think offensively for Duke and then you know as we see them manage this situation for Grayson lus the guy that they do want to get involved is Jaylen Calhoun and look if youre youre not going to be able to throw it to him as often as you would if Riley Leonard was the quarterback maybe you find some ways to to hand it to him you see Calhoun wearing five for the Blue Devils in a slot here bottom of the Applause screen snap the lus and the waters again Duke got an early start I think it was hazley the tight end that might have moved first B start offense number 73 5yd penalty still first down well right next to him the right tackles Jake hornybrook from Stanford at a malvin prep in the Philadelphia area Mike elos done some mixing and matching with his offensive line Jacob monks playing at center tonight Justin pickets Plugged In Playing over there at Right Guard you got Brian Parker tonight one of the top a all sorts of movement here but they got Monk and Barton back which is the real deal for that offensive Applause line and Waters will get a first down or at least some of it back inside the original first down Mark at the 44 Tyler guys theres a lot of cool story lines weaved throughout this rivalry for offensive lineman Jak monk he grew up a Duke fan because his dad Stanley played running back at Duke in the mid 80s but he admits there was a point in his life where he did wear some Carolina blue because of his late Uncle Quincy monk who was a great linebacker for the heels in the late 90s 2000s says there are some crazy pictures of him wearing that quote ugly blue but thankfully he does not remember that no question Jacob is all Duke trying to win his first and last game in this rivalry guys great stop thank you Tyler terrific young man too Jacob Mon and here is Jaylen Coleman and hell get three to the 47 so third down coming up Blue Devils trying to kick it into gear here a little bit on the Desmond Evans tackle and Ral got Scott Elliott shaken up and so while they tend to the Duke lman we step aside in Chapel Hill in this final Duke Carol a game and of course his dad was Stanley monk a terrific running back for the Blue Devils and there is his late Uncle a sensational linebacker in the late 90s in 2001 thats little Jacob with 041 Quincy mon who we lost way too soon to cancer several years ago what a nice lineage for that family with this particular rivalry and just terrific people third down now for Loftus in the blue that devs shoots it near side go to Calhoun if you need the big catch right Tim first down exactly right and good timing once again by lus thrown with some anticipation an accurate throw coun just sits it down just past the sticks hit a bunch formation into the the boundary and good accurate throw tell Grayson Loft this quarterback Gaffney to a 5A title beat Dutch fort by the way for the state champ ship that had Clemsons Antonio Williams on the team Dy finished undefeated that year then Mike Elco said he is a winner and all you need to know is that story to prove that point first and 10 and Jaylen Coleman banging away inside the 45 for about three Cedric gray The Tackle of the Brad student Coleman who had 480 yards and four touchdowns a year ago and was a central figure in the run back in the running back room in Mike ELOs first campaign and you know I think Duke in general does a nice job of playing a lot of guys y you know they do running back defensive line you see it and I think because of it you talking about the versatility of the offensive line and how theyve played different combos some of thats been injury but I think that helps them play better late in football Applause games heres Loftus to throw going to take a shot caught first down making the move is Jordan Moore inside the 25 and the Blue Devils to the Tar Hill 22 good catch by Jordan Moore who boy pressed into hard times at the QB spot we might see him go former quarterback again we might and a little bit of play action just hold the linebackers just a tad and by doing that you basically get an isolation route you know between Mo and the corner and once again F LOF this good timing and good ball location it feels like as Mike El code hoped hes settling in a little better for sure off the Applause 22 give is Coleman Jaylen Coleman keeps his feet couple of missed tackles and hes near another tarel or another blue double first down at the tarel 10 Don Chapman made the tackle and watch Coleman press this hole does a good job of pressing the hole before he cuts it up and looked like it was maybe monk there who got a great block before it cut up and good job with this Duke offensive line you know one of the things theyre doing too is just watch them the number of times theyre using the Cadence to their advantage whether its the clap or the Cadence you know its not been predictable for Duke offensively first and goal at the Tar Hill 10 Loftus to the end zone caught Jordan Moore and a Duke touchdown how about that drive by Grayson Loftus how about the route by Jordan Moore just working inside its a run pass option A lot of guys up into the line of scrimmage for North Carolina lus kind of just takes the ball out of the belly of the back and does a good job firing a strike to Jordan Moore who does a good job of winning Todd Pino now for the point and the kick from Pino is good so the Blue Devils who had 33 yards on their first two drives now Cobble together nine plays 70 yards and 621 and Grayson lus fires a touchdown pass to Jordan Mo four for four 48 yds and a touchdown to Jordan Moore in a critical drop Dukes just their fourth touchdown last 12 quarters that was a pretty big one there yeah it felt like a huge one and Mike elcos comment about look making that throw in the first quarter on third down think he maybe had a feeling it would you know start to open up a little bit for him and Chapman bungled the kick return but Carolinas going to get it at the uh 25 yd line hes signal for the fair catch by R the ball becomes dead North Carolinas ball the dead ball spot first down a fair catch it is right so it was a fair catch but he didnt field it but because it was a fair catch the ball becomes dead at the spot that he dropped the football and so even though he signal for a fair catch the ball is going to be placed on the the one yd line because he dropped it that is a huge mistake especially coming off the heels of that impressive Duke Drive offensively ended up in a touchdown and now the blue double pressure which has been pretty consistent through Carolinas first three possessions a touchdown on the opening drive but two Red Zone field goal kicks and heres made to work looking to throw down the field and intercepted on the backside jayen Sten Stenson inside the 20 to the North Carolina Applause 13 and jayen Stenson just got his third career interception and his first of the year and it was gift drap by Drake may I am not sure what hes looking at basically has heres the route combination hes got a tight end working over here and then youve got TZ Walker and then youve got an in cut this in cut right here is where the football should go and I dont know why he gets hung up on TZ Walker and throws into an absolute crowd of people maybe a little bit of pressure at him but that can be the decision when youre backed up now can lus and the Blue Devils take advantage and get the lead off the interception heres Jordan Waters and he will break the 10 and be pushed back Giovani bigger playing in his final game at Keenan Stadium The Tackle and I think if youre Mike elker here and hes talked to us so much about controlling the game I think you slow this thing way down now inside of five minutes before the half you can still pick up a first down I think youre going to try to do what they can to eat up as much clock as you can and still come away with a score Waters checks out all the way to the left now hell move back here with lofas hell hand the ball to the big back hell fire inside the five and its first and goal Duke at the Carolina three as we come up on four minutes to play first half Marcus Allen The Tackle Tim Duke with stood the early flurry but holding Carolina to a couple field goals now gives him a chance to take the lead theres a moment there with the way Carolina was moving you thought wait this game could get away from duke just because theyre not set up to get into a shootout and next thing you know got the ball on the four yd line first down and youre really running the football well yep first and Applause goal here goes Waters and a terrific play by gainor Amari Gainer came firing over the top from Duke right side on this play yeah Mari Gainer does a good job as soon as tight end blocks down hes just going to run this down from behind watch this tight end blocks down he chases his hip and is able to get there Waters its a good job by Applause Gainer and I think Duke is starting to milk this a little bit yep wild C with Moore Jordan Moore to the left side Carolina gets a stop there so they plug in the former quarterback around the goal line Javari ritzy you see number five there get off the stock he was the first Tar Heel of the play along with stick Lane so we saw the wildcat with more the former quarterback and now heres lus assuming on my part hes going to take third down and goal here yeah and I think that again you know working the clock a little bit here going to run the football Force Carolina to take a time out if you run the football on third down Mike ELO going to take the timeout first though Applause wow how about the momentum shift weve seen here in the second quarter Duke defensively holding Caroline to the two field goals in the Red Zone we talked about their number one in the ACC in Red Zone and then Carolina makes the one mistake you cant make Tim cant make it well I mean really two mistakes its a dropped uh return on the fair catch which places the ball at the one yd line you know so many times because of the change in the rules with these kickoffs guys relax and instead now youre pinned at the one yd line and then inexplicably Drake may just tries to force it and now yeah I think the momentum Swift you know swing is huge and I would say this if youre Duke kicking a field goal on this drive is fine you know like as much as Mike Elco you know wants to be aggressive in this game look and I know theres a lot of time left but in the half but I dont think for him that you have to feel like youve got to take the lead with this possession Waters is with lus they got two tight ends two Applause receivers lus will keep and Duke has tied the game at 13 and I love the play call by Kevin Johns it is a read play but they block the backside differently and theyre reading a different player watch The Tackle Barton hes going to come out here and block and now youre reading this Defender instead and when you do that it just cleans it up pretty clearly for the quarterback Grayson Loftus able to walk in and now Duke has gone in front on the Pino kick the Blue Devils lead the ACC in points off turnovers they now have 67 on the year yeah and it starts because Drake May has a force backed up Stinson the great time to come up with his first interception and then lus able to punch Grayson lus has put Duke ahead couple of Blue Devil scores here late in the second and Dukes gone in front by a point at 1413 Carolina will have three timeouts and this one is kind of skipped along the ground because the kicker fell down Charlie ham and the Tarheels will have the ball around their 27 lets check in about halftime heres Kelsey rigs westerm thanks so much hanging out with EAC right now the rest of the crew going to be with us in just a little while for the ACC Network halftime report talking about what we saw in a rivalry matchup earlier between Florida State in Miami how about this one Del physicality Duke running that football but look out for this offense they got a little bit of time guys well see you in just a couple minutes right here on the sideline at the half thanks Kelsey Eric appreciate it full day in the ACC we got a full 202 to go before the half and Carolina trying to run it with am Marian Hampton he will the ball Carri right at about five or six on first down maybe seven before Freeman makes the tackle we go inside two minutes because you have all of your time outs dont need to be frantic with just inside two minutes Duke bringing pressure May from the pocket and going to throw it away nesb was the guy in the neighborhood Brandon Johnson the safety had him locked up around Midfield Tim howd they get the Deep shot to Walker early not able to fire one now it feels like well early they had press coverage oneonone with a safety in the middle of the field and hes running outside the numbers know now Duke playing with two high safety obviously trying to protect from a big shot down the field heres Hampton sprinting through hell have the first down across the 40 Tar Hill 41 will be the line of scrimmage Brandon Johnson again the hit on am Marian Hampton and again because of your timeouts because itll stop until its reset on a first down continuing to run it is Duke plays this threeman fronts not a bad idea may loads and throws for Walker who makes a catch did he hold on he did holy smokes Joshua pick it was there and Drake May dropped another one in the bucket to tez Walker well and TZ this is just straight speed just takes off and runs and runs right by picket picket never turns back to locate the football and TZ just does a great job of tracking it 48 yds theyll hand to Hampton going to the right and inside the 10 Carolina still got all three timeouts clock rolls 70 seconds to go first half in Chapel Applause Hill I think I probably would have used one of my timeouts right there on the first down run especially with the ability to still get another first down long look back over here to the sideline time running off for Carolinas second down Play heres May Duke bringing five Drake to his left eludes one line now set shoots it in zone out of bounds incomplete pressure came from Wesley Williams who is really had a nice finish to this regular season a dozen tackles three for loss and one sack in his last last three coming in he just ripped Drakes shirt nearly tackled him by ripping a shirt and now listen third Applause down does not look like youre going to get a oneonone to tez Nate McCollum may be the guy although theyre swapping him with Nesbit also got copenhaver here to this near side May looks that way set and threw it from nesbet who got taken out on the play by Chandler Rivers the corner Bryson n came in already shaken up not near 100 had a really good first half but Carolinas going to have to kick their way back into the lead here in the closing half minute list and thats the third time now that weve seen it and its a great job we talk about the red zone defense theyre getting pressure on the quarterback and theyre good doing a good job just squeezing windows in the passing game in the Red Zone 25 yd try for Noah Bernett hes hit from 31 and 23 in this first half and now Carolinas gone back in front with 23 seconds left on his third field goal of this half and Tim got to give Duke some credit defensively theyve done a terrific job getting Red Zone stops not allowing Carolina touchdowns not again we got basketball for you tomorrow afternoon 200 Eastern well we only got Its about a driver or nine iron to the Smith Center an Dr Malcolm Huckaby will be there number 19 North Carolina host Lehi and then a triple header on the ladies card with depal and Louisville Davidson Carolina and Team USA is over in Durham to see Carol awon Duke BLS all the Hoops Sunday on the ACC network was that a shot at me like a driver or an N iron like driver and drive driver for me 99 for you is that is that what you were saying no its a little more of a driver its a driver and then you probably hit a n okay I I thought you were taking a shot at my my game listen you know one of the things about you know just the move at offensive coordinator for North Carolina chip Lindsay knew this season they want to be better in the Red Zone they wanted to run the football they want to protect the quarterback couple of things that are happening so far tonight not better than the Red Zone the quarterbacks been under a little bit of pressure sure has and we knew Dukes defensive front Tim was good and the Blue Devils have showcased it here in the first half you know they have and and you know typically when Im you know preparing for Duke and watching them its theyre inside guys that have wrecked so much Havoc but now looking at the outside guys theyre winning for them and thats been a bit of an issue yep feels like Wesley Williams just the latest guy from the The Edge to good pressure at that last possession so Mike elkos got one timeout and 23 seconds left stranger things have happened in the new Carolina football game and Waters is going to be tackled and that is Miles Murphy and that might be that minute drive and a a field goal to take the lead and so I think that if youre Mike Elco youve got to be thrilled that you weather that initial St war and your freshman quarterback has settled down and the Blue Devils are going to get the ball at their 25 to start this second half and heres a look at the chances in the mops and lets check in with Tyler tanal yeah guys I had a chance to catch up with Mike Elco just a few minutes ago and he said he liked the way his offense finally caught Rhythm there late in the first half the goal going into the game was to run the ball well and to control possession he felt like they did that the message to his team in the locker room at halftime three simple words go get it down two points heading into the second half guys Grayson lus hands to Jordan Waters and hes wrapped up after a yard or two by Giovanni bers North Carolina is 29 and4 since mat Browns return in 2019 when leading at the half Tim two of the four have happened this year here Virginia here and in Atlanta to Georgia Tech and I think one of the biggest issues is they havent been able to stop the run late in football games and especially against those two teams see if they have it remedy wild cat again heres Jordan Moore taking the snap and straight ahead the Blue Devils try and run it but Desmond Evans is right there so a little read option with the former quarterback turned wide receiver in Jordan Moore and Dukes got third in the full 10 and you wonder if theyre theyre reading it with Jordan Moore or if theyre calling it just because of the ball handling issues just the threat of the quarterback to keep it on a run Blue Devils were three of five on third down the first half the full 10 for lofas long throw and offline for Calhoun now we got flags two of them one at the line of scrimmage and one here in front of the Tar Hill bench on the ball toward Applause Calhoun and hickon Tennessees Jeff Flanigan is our referee Applause tonight two fouls on the play one on each team holding offense number 62 passing to feris Defense number 28 those fouls will offset well replay the down all right so well rewind third and 10 but because it slows it down Carolina can certainly get the defensive callin that they want and you would not be surprised to see Duke double Cadence this to get a good picture tar Hills bringing four lus in traffic throws and overshoots Calhoun with huzzy behind him and I mean there was a lot of fray in front of Grayson lus here thatll be a three and out for the Blue Devils to start the half well the pocket just kind of squeezes believe it was Rucker who just is able to just walk the left tackle back into Bon into loftuss lap and its why it was in Aon throw one of the things Carolina is doing theyre playing cover one meaning mantoman coverage with one safety in the middle of the field and so there are opportunities in the passing game but you do have to protect up front Porter Wilsons punt toward huzi fair catch call for and made at the Carolina 36 so Duke has started each half with a three and out and that brings us to tonights food lineon food for thought and Tim this is tez Walker you know we know that hes big we know that hes fast I think the way that he tracks the football is kind of what I think makes him different than other guys that are also big and fast basically has gone two go routes tonight and theyve connected on both of them three catches almost 100 yds for Walker of course he had a 146 and 11 catch game against Virginia with a touchdown and theres Hampton scurrying through for four Nick moris The Tackle for the Blue Devils Walkers sixth game tonight hes had five catches 117 two touchdowns the last two games for Carolina and theres Hampton again just four more itll be third and two carrier Freeman with the tackle third down Duke trying to lock down the Run game here third and short its a big feels like a big play for the Blue Devils it it certainly does and especially if this ball ends up staying on the Applause ground play clock May waiting patiently here and now hes going to keep it and Drake May lateral it to amarian Hampton who gets the first down weve seen him throw lefthanded touchdown passes and now we see him in a traffic jam pitch it to Hampton little chess pass in traffic I learned it from his brother look I he got fooled on an RPO heres may had to get the center judge out of the way now alludes a lot of pressure to his right and is going to take the loss and go out of bounds the center judge almost disrupted this whole snap listen I think there was confusion about holding it for a substitution the center judge almost gets run over by Drake May dropping back theres a lot that happened previous play I think Drake gets fooled ends up taking off make then makes like a Patrick Mahomes type play center judge almost gets run over and then Drake inexplicably takes a sack rather than throwing the football away loss of three heres May going to run again Freeman going to track him down terrific play by the Blue Devil linebacker this what I mean about the the the previous play center judge look at him I mean he comes in right here hes in the pocket and then as this thing gets strung out like Drake needs to just go ahead and throw it away instead Runs Out of Bounds takes a three yard loss yeah and now they threw a couple more on the play by Freeman so its third and 15 and a little shovel pass and here goes Hampton trying to follow blocks and hell work his way inside the 40 Ryan Smith who closed the weight game with an interception makes the stop for Mike elos team and the offense staying out there the ball on the 39 yd line kind of a No Mans Land ESPN analytics says no go but heres Carolina May going to make the long throw Walker the sliding catch and its going to be spotted at the 30 and thats enough for the first down and this is a really interesting spot Wes because this ball was thrown a little bit inside and TZ Walker goes down to catch the football and and I think that Mike Elco saying youve got to look at this see the ball goes down it all depends on when he possesses that football were going to go to review on this I believe Jeff Flanigan toots the whistle we step aside in Chapel Hill after further review the ring on the field stands its a first down so the catch for Walker as we rejoin you from Chapel Hill its the right call as you see TZ Walker goes down he catches that football but I think theres reason to believe that ball is basically at the stripe of the 30 yd line which is a first down Carolina with two tight ends Morales and copenhaver and through the formation theyre going to toss it and this is Chapman the Speedy freshman on the little flip pass from May thats doc Chapman fresman from Virginia Beach Virginia tackled by Wesley Williams after a 10 yd run or pass actually yeah was a pass quarterbacks love those Wes dont cheat US on those thats a completion and a first down but little wiggle to Chapman look another guy that was certainly scripted For Thought hell stay in his two tight look here its JJ Jones who had a nice catch in the first half and now may thought about it to copenhaver now going to shoot it in zone and offline for Walker now we get a flag thrown back in front of the Carolina bench at the 18 the throw to Walker Brandon Johnson the safety was over there but I think the flag had something to do with part of the play here at the line of scrimmage well see well we have one in the corner and then one down in the line of scrimmage goodness and a busy Jeff lanin two fouls on the play one on each team an eligible receiver downfield offense number 63 passing the fs Defense number three the fouls are offet or replay the down Michel goes he said earlier this week one thing I learned about my first Duke Carolina game is the coach doesnt need to get a technical foul which happened in the late stages a year ago at Wallace wave but he is in disbelief here now may looking to keep it boy Duke just closes things down terrific play by Williams again this red shirt freshman from Gainesville Virginia we told you hes had a strong last three hes having a terrific night tonight just look at I mean Spencer Rollin just throws him out of the way Rolland goes 315 lbs you see Williams Applause kind of a lean lanky player certainly playing with a lot of power heres may this is Walker on inside move and hell break the 15 to the 13 Rivers The Music Tackle Carolina in a hurry up here five catches 112 tonight for Walker Applause Applause heres the give inside and Duke rallies there again that defensive Applause front and that Blue Devil front that time jam on Franklin and theres the dline guy for Mike ELO chess Simpson a terrific technician tremendous height School coach in Georgia later worked at Miami and Mark Ricks Administration and hes done a marvelous job here in durh well and the guys that hes coaching are having a huge impact on this football game we just called Wesley Williams name and then is jam on Franklin 309 lb but playing with a ton of quickness Carolina going for it here heres May looking left pumps in trouble steps throws caught JJ Jones first and goal Carolina on a Houdini move by Drake May so one of the things hes such a special Prospect is because of plays like that just the amazing physical ability hes just able to you know play with strength in the pocket heres nesbet and thrown behind the line and hell take the loss Freeman led the Duke tacklers with Johnson what I mean you basically Amari Hampton gets run over in pass protection but hes able to play through it I mean that looks like that looks like Josh Allen and theres also just an awareness too you think about a couple of the plays weve seen on fourth down Wes where because its Fourth Down he knows that he has to make a play and he has the ability to do Applause it second and goal at the nine after the loss on the throw to nesbot heres May shooting it in zone and a diving attemp by Jones comes up empty so Jones the Junior from Myrtle Beach cant come up with it Carolinas looking at third and goal at the nine again 14th play of this drive that is chewed up a good bit of third quarter clock I thought this was pretty good ball location by Drake May tight coverage for Chandler rivers and Drake kind of put it only the only spot he could good May again long throw looking far Corner Nesbit there and Brandon Johnson again in the coverage for the Blue Devils its a really good job of coverage by Brandon Johnson theyre trying to get nbut on the corner route so basically you have under routes and then a corner youre trying to bring that outside coverage to attracted to the underneath routes and run the corner route but its just a good job of playing outside by Brandon Johns and you know there was really nowhere for Nesbit to go because he had outside leverage 27 yd try for Bernett now to push the lead to five and the kick from Noah Bernett is good its his fourth field goal of the night another Red Zone stopped by Duke back to Chapel Hill this is the week we honor all of Americas Heroes especially two here tonight Jeremy Jacobs is the asso director for sports performance at Duke he served in the US Army in the second ranger battalion he served combat rotations to operation Iraqi freedom and operation enduring freedom on the North Carolina sideline Charlton Warren is the codefensive coordinator and defensive backs coach hes an Air Force Academy Alum served 10 years in the Air Force and was special ops after 911 flying drones in Iraq ma Brown says hes very upbeat and positive but he is direct and hard on the kids and they like it when he speaks they listen so were sending out a heartfelt thank you to all of our active military and Veterans for your courage and commitment to our country absolutely thank you Taylor for Char warrren now both he and Jeremy have been involved in the real deal and what charl Warren tell the team in the military you cant have a bad day it was interesting too you know hearing the head coaches talk about their assistance and its the amount of respect the head coaches half for them and clearly it falls all the way down through to the players pretty awesome sure it does now all of a sudden Carolina with a fivepoint lead on Bretts fourth field goal of the night and heres Grayson Loftus in his second career start trying to maybe go find that Vibe Dukes offense had late second quarter and Jaylen Coleman is the ball carrier and he gets bottled up by Miles Murphy and the Blue Devils without Riley Leonard here tonight for a second straight game and Grayson L us with the reins in his hands of Kevin Johns offense and trailing only five here and its been a clean ball game from the Blue Devil perspective it has I think theyve done a good job managing the situations for lus where it hasnt been third and forever in being in the drop back game going to hand it no lus will keep that time and pick up maybe a yard or two but what happens here is dude believes third and long and I think listen you said it a second ago because its still a pretty close football game would not be surprised to see Mike Elco be conservative here tight ends have been quiet tonight hazley is on the field but hes in a bunch at the bottom of the formation lus looks batted in the air and that ball is live and recovered got knocked Away by Cayman Rucker and Kevin Hester has recovered it for the Tar Heels ruer the butcher forces the first Duke turnover of the night C Rucker has gotten everybodys attention who hes faced this year because he plays with so much power but this really is just a speed rush a little rip inside I do think that theres a chance that that ball is coming forward oh there its been ruled incomplete so I never saw a signal from an official calling it incomplete it played out and now was ruled incomplete man that is close and now theyre going to have a look thr on the field with a forward pass the previous play is under further so Jeff Flanigan gets us to the break fivepoint lead on review of Ruckers play and here but lets go back to Cayman Ruckers effort well Cayman Rucker with a rip move gets to LOF this and then gets his hand on the football and because they ruled this in incompletion and you get a bunch of looks that look right there to me looks like its a fun pole couple of the other looks look like it maybe is slightly coming forward and because they ruled it an incompletion even though theyre a little late doing that yeah I think thats why it stands but certainly doesnt take away the effort by Rucker Porter Wilson theyre going to fake it hes going to throw here to the near side this is Terry Moore and hell have the first down how about the converted running back Terry Moore catching a pass from Porter Wilson and ran through a Cedric gry talk with the guts of the call you know Mike Elco certainly talked about having to steal a possession but steals possession by getting the ball to more in the open field and is a good job of making it to Defender Miss looks like a converted running back and what a big call by Mike Elco in a big game you know he talked about players elevating I mean thats a coach elevating in the moment first and 10 Jordan Waters spinning away but right into the arms of Desmond Evans after two yards so now we got Duke Carolina cooking here late in the Applause third Blue Devils have lost three of their last five after a 4 and0 start coincided with the injury to Riley Leonard in the final stages of the Notre Dame game Carolinas lost their last two ACC games they did beat Campbell last week and they go to Clemson who by the way played pretty good today next Saturday and both still hold out hope for Charlotte Jordan Moore in a wildcat took a big lick that was stick Lane coming down the scene and the first time that weve seen basically the quarterback run in this wildcat look by Jordan Mo and watch stick Lane because hes just going to meet at the ball carrier here and its just really good playing downhill and getting more down whos pretty dangerous with the ball in his hands Music and you know now a critical third down but manageable and I think Calhoun seems to be the guy for me that seems been a little bit quiet but they like to get him the ball in some of these situations shz more in the backfield with Loftus from the pocket steps up sack miles Murphy first sack of the lofas tonight by Carolina I mean miles Murphy just rushes with power on Jacob monk just able to push him back into loftuss lap and I thought there was a chance he had Calhoun right there you see five stick Lane is kind of working in that direction it was going to have to happen quickly and how about the defensive line for Carolina kind of taking over the game so after the fake punt three more plays Duke punts huzzy the fair catch taken at the 26 well dont forget ACC PM will be with us in Atlanta next Saturday for Syracuse Georgia Tech the Pacman will be there at 400 right up maybe by the tech Tower where he was a couple of weeks ago get youre ready for all the week 12 action and more ACC pm on the road next Friday in the 18 L right here on acc Network well be at Bobby DOD next Saturday night under the lights for the orange in the jackets thats Jordan Waters by the way in the Duke injury tent heres a little flip to amarian Hampton around the corner Freeman nudged him out after Carolina started at its 27 with this fivepoint lead in the final two minutes of the third second and now we have a time out for an injured player its they got to get jam on Franklin off the field he was down around the Applause 31 fans dont like it but that was a legitimate injury Franklin trying to get himself off the field but not able to get off the the thick white stripe where the officials occupy here is Hampton Straight Ahead Amari and Hampton Into the Blue Devil second secondary across Midfield to the Duke 49 little dead leg move here Tim in the hole Yeah dead leg good job of hitting it up the hole and then on jayen sson trying to give it to him heres May to his right going to heave it downfield JJ Jones cant come up with it and theres a flag against al blades in coverage passing to ference Defense number seven 15yd penalty first down theres part of what Drake May does it make you think hes in the street telling you run to the Buick and look for the ball thats why theres elements of how he plays that are a little bit like the stars that play in the NFL now right theyre trying to work a uh just a little dump off to the back but he escapes next thing you know heaves it 40 yards down down the field you get a pass interference pound heres May again long throw and offline for tez Walker Chandler rivers in coverage for the blue Del I think one of the things about Drake is that you always have to defend the entire field yeah because weve seen him you know Big Shots down the field throwing the Deep ball on a go route on or a post then his ability as a runner or climbing in the pocket but seeing wide enough on the field to spit it out to the perimeter and so I think thats one of the things why hes just so difficult heres Hampton running on that tight end move side and not a lot there Dylan was the guy then a flag has come in here and it felt like that anas peoples foul face Mas on the 36 and Nick Morris the linebacker on a face mask Applause call it feels a little bit as you see Morris up on the Jersey I didnt see it originally but see what we have here is Hampton is he got the left hand we cannot see his left hand but his left hand seem to be on a jersey wow Carolina gets a benefit of one there and heres May keeping it to his left got a block from copenhaver inside the the 10 and hurdles to the five stensson is the Blue Devil safety that Drake May hurdled to make it first and goal he for two years theyve been saying Drake protect yourself and I think Drake just said this is the Duke Carolina game a going over the top 14 yd run straight away goes Hampton and he gets to the one a look at a May again I feel like like weve seen him change his running style being you know more cognizant of protecting himself but I think this is an element of just the magnitude of this football game and it just being a fivepoint contest Terry mois shaking up on the Hampton Music run Dukes medical staff folks out to have a look at Hampton or more rather for the Blue Devils amarian Hampton has 156 total yards of offense hes got 135 on the ground hes got a 21 yards on four catches hes got 14 more than Duke has of total offense tonight Tim thats incredible yeah meanwhile Drake May passing is 18 of 28 for 226 and hes carried it eight times for 11 yards and the most dramatic a moment ago and they still look to Terry Moore a guy who has been terrific in Dukes secondary here believe theyre looking at his right ankle and you see he just kind of gets rolled up on there Morris and it looks like is that Rolland I think 75 that was involved in that just big bodies and Mike El go out to check in on the former running back you it was interesting talking about the former running back you know in his move to safety Mike Elco thinks theres an NFL future for Terry Moore at safety and you know often times when you get kids that are just really good football players throughout high school theyre running backs and linebackers or running backs in safeties or receivers and defensive backs and you they maybe have their mind set on something and sometimes it takes a coach to identify maybe what their strengths are and feels like Mike Elco has done a good job of that with a lot of his players good news for the Blue Devils Moore is able to walk it off and Coach ELO and M Brown sharing a Smile In the Heat of battle here with second and two coming up on what might very well be the final play of the third quarter I think that the smiles may change or like ELO if he can hold Carolina to three that smile will get bigger and if Mack will finally see his offense punch one in I think be an authentic smile it has been its been a rugged fight from the 10 in Tim Lukes defense has only allowed that touchdown in the first drive tonight every other red Zones been converted by field goal heres Hampton trying to find it no knocked down right away and it looked like Carter was there tonight and heres Carolina six possession on Third and goal theyre going to pitch it to Hampton as he going to score he does am Marian Hampton behind the blocking of Bryson Nesbit in the end zone for the Tar Applause Heels thats a nice job with chip Lindsay offensive coordinator for North Carolina with some of the struggles running it in between the tackles inside the five they fake the Jet Sweep to McCollum and then have a flip outside to get the big back Hampton on the perimeter with Nesbit doing a good job blocking on the perimeter seven plays 73 yds and 223 the Bernette Point makes it a 26 14 lead now for Carolina and amarian Hampton has his 13 rushing score of the Year well our New York Life Drive recap tonight is not a drive that scores but maybe more of the drive of Drake May tonight Tim the drive of never giving up on a play little chess pass to to Hampton movs in trouble fourth down just being strong in the pocket just his ability to create heed this one down the field who gets pass interference which obviously extends the drive and then how about the drive in terms of the effort to sell out in a rivalry game that means a lot to both sides y Carolina trying to win for a fifth straight time against the Blue Devils seven of the last 10 and Drake Mays over 200 yds of passing does have the interception to Stinson that sparked a Blue Devil touchdown that gave Duke the lead before that field goal Drive so Samir Hagens with Terry Moore injured Hagen is deep to return the kick for the Blue Devils remember Moore was averaging about 23 yards a return and the kick from Liam Boyd and therell be no return for Hagen and Duke is going to start the MZ 25 dont forget postgame alive and well here in Chapel Hill following our coverage of the tar Hills and Blue Devils Kelsey rigs with EJ Manuel mlan and Eddie Royal on acc Network and our congratulations Mark Rick today in Athens at Sanford Stadium for his oncampus celebration of his upcoming induction into the National Football foundation in college Hall of Fame in early December in Vegas coach will be with us in Atlanta next week jaquez Moore now with Grayson less and duks got some work to do offensively here and this is Moore picking up five almost six on first down before ritzy the stop for Carolina and weve got a Blue Devil lineman shaking up here and greme Barton whos been struggling with knee pain here the last month is down back well Graham Barton was able to make it off the field under his own power which is good news but he went straight to the Duke Medical tent and you see the Richer freshman from St X in Cincinnati Brian Parker has coming to the lineup now he was part of that starting unit but again they to their credit Duke is Shifting and shuffling guys around in that front five and heres lus just his third throw of the half and more cannot track it down Carolina had Armani Chapman in coverage and will hardy helping over the top from safety but a good looking throw from long was a great throw right to the hands of Jordan Moore and it looks like Chapman maybe just there a hair early but a good job job of playing the eyes and then raking the arm of Jordan Moore kind of a bang bang play goes in Carolinas favor lus has missed on three throws here in the second half so he is now four for 10 tonight pressure coming flips it over the head of joque Moore incomplete and had more caught it Duke would have had a chance here I mean Wes it makes four was a pressure and they basically watch theyre bringing all this pressure and theyre trying to leak more out because all this pressure is coming after the the block hes going to leak out and then theres nobody left theres no one left youre going to run for days I mean you probably have an angle on you but its going to be a 40 yard pickup so the Blue Devils Tim go three and out for a second time in three possessions here here in the second half huzzy will signal for the fair catch shy of the 35 and Carolina leading by 12 early here in quarter 4 and Mike ELO depth may be a problem here with some injuries Taylor yeah guys as grm Bon went into the tent Terry Moore Jr finally came out he was in there for about 10 15 minutes after he was escorted off the field he came out wearing a boot on his right angle you can tell on his vase he is visibly disappointed so it looks like more Junior will be done for the night all right thankk you thats two guys by the way in the tent that are critical to Dukes success on either side of the ball Jeremiah Lewis by the way into the game for Terry Moore and here is Hampton and he got wrapped up in the back field by Aaron Hall and its not just the old heads like Dwayne Carter and RJ Oben and Jamie on Franklin for Duke they got some young Talent people is a senior this Wesley Williams and Aaron Hall Tim theyre Real Deals now this defensive line has been outstanding in this football game I know Hamptons got over 100 yards hes a really good back but defensive line just CA some trouble heres May trying to find some seam here and oh boy Freeman hit him Morris hit him going to the Carolina bench and the partisans here at Chapel Hill didnt like the way that play finished I mean hes in the field of play obviously when they both contact him now youre not allowed to kind of finish it out of bounds but do the right no call what a little gray area in a rivalry game all right third down and seven it looks like one onone coverage to Drake Mays right on TZ Walker without Blades versus press coverage now the safety fading that way heres May hes going to tea up Walker whos on a go and it is broken up by blades all he had to see was Lewis kind of lean back right Tim he did I mean oneonone coverage look you get isolated oneonone coverage going take it and its just a straight go route all blades does a decent job of kind of hand fighting I think this ball is just you know barely underthrown and because its barely underthrown blades is able to recover and make a play on it first three and out of the night for Carolina and first time tonight we see the Aussie Tom mcginness punted away and Jaylen Calhoun who averages just under 12 yards a return only has 10 Returns this year Waits and the Guinness gets that away but its going to travel here to the 25 and look at calhon fight for two or three yards up the field on the 38 yd punt but Al blades swats away a big play attempt from the tar Hills who lead by 12 said about spayer thats about right huh all right running it up m brown lost his first two games against Duke 8889 has not lost since and leads by 12 early in corner four dke from its 30 and Loftus has to look up top avoids the first Rush cannot get away from the second wave of Carolina blue Javari ritzy and Cayman Rucker causing Havoc Tyler ritzy and Rucker able to get past left tackle Graham Barton there he did come off the field with a knee injury went into the tent came right back out with that left knee tightly wrapped and hes back out there at tackle guys oo ready to go playing at The Tackle Spot you saw the note on Mel Kyper draft board of barttin as a center heres lus trying to rip one and does and that is Nikki Dal mullens 10th catch of the year its been an injury play senior campaign for dalen first completion of the second half for lus Duke to the line and rolling lus again back across this is DAL Mullen on back to back ground grabs and gray will take him down at the Tar Hill 47 with Eckles look at watch Graham Bon hes back in the game we saw him its over here on the left side of the screen just does an excellent job very next play same thing you just see why such a big part of this you know the success that this team has had and looked ugly when it happened its good to see him back out there able to compete senior from brenwood Tennessee just south of Nashville has had a terrific career for the Blue Devils playing all along the offensive line and a cross training Tim you hear coaches talk about it youre seeing it tonight with Duke well it you know makes your valuable to have a versatile offensive lineman that can play multiple positions second down lus is hit three in a row here last one to Calhoun and heres Jordan Waters and Dukes got a first down 36 yd line will be the next snap after power Echo time you know one of the things I appreciate about the way Mike Elco manages a game is and some of it has to do with the fact that hes got a Young quarterback but you know youre obviously down 12 but there hasnt been any Panic of hey weve got a totally abandon the Run game were going to just you know drop back and throw it I think there is just a natural patience with how he deals with a game and you even being down two scores thats Hagens in orbit heres lus now down the seam thats Calhoun on the cross knocked out of bounds inside the 15 at the 13 by Chapman is Jaylen Calhoun and when you dont abandon the run you can then you know on a run down have hard play action work a post deep cross combination and get your best wide receiver open on the Deep cross 23 yd throw by Loftus there largest play or longest play of the night for Duke and a first and 10 the Carolina 13 under 10 to go now in this 110th meeting Waters here to the near side a stiff arm at the five and a touchdown for Duke Jordan Waters into the end zone for the 11th time this year this is an impressive run because you have an unblocked Defender gvan Biggers at the line of scrimmage but its Jordan wats ability to give a stiff arm and then just win with speed to the pylon seven plays 70 yds and Applause 315 heres Pino hell kick for the point and were back to a fivepoint game jayen Calhoun set it up with this great grab here good catch nice read and throw by Loftus and then its Jordan Waters with the stiff arm and then the speed the DAR Hills excuse me Duke battling back Waters is in the end zone you see the details of his night and he and amarian Hampton we thought they might have a nice little Showdown and were getting it Tim and an onside kick by Duke and the Blue Devils have it oh my Applause goodness kylen Walker or is it pton Jones it is pton Jones the backup at running back how about that Charlie ham delivered the goods on the kick Mike ELO talked about stealing possessions and he just do a good job of finding a little dead spot there Martin Morales is trying to come up to field that football and hes just not able to to field it with all of the traffic there see Morales believe hes the first one to touch the Applause football thats just a really good kick then a good job of coverage good job of scouting as well finding that kind of void Morales of course who fielded the onside kick a year ago in Boone and ran for the touchdown in that wild appalachin State game at kid Brewer meanwhile Charlie hams the hero of the moment for Duke the kicker two big special team T set the game clock to 9 minutes and 40 seconds please 940 think about it second should have come off the clock the onside kick and then Tim the play in the first half where Carolina misjudged the fair catching so for yeah Special fake fake punt theres obviously obviously the fake punt that drive kind of fizzled out but certainly special teams going in Dukes favor heres lus whos four of six on the touchdown Drive handing to Coleman and Duke will start on the ground picking up three before Don Chapman makes the tackle and Duke is shuffling guys in and out of the offensive line Justin picket has just come in Scott Elliot goes out they move offensive lineman in and out of the game like most teams move skill Applause guys LOF this ready and the give again is man and Jaylen Coleman to the 46 and I think because you you know the surprise on side kick like you dont get it on third down here youre going for it right I mean youre on youre in plus territory territory 8 minutes left in the game youre down five like I think if youre willing to do that probably willing to go for it on fourth down Duke Smiths their last five third down tries Calhoun in the orbit loft is to Coleman tries to bend it right first down and more inside the 40 and finally taken down at the 36 by Don Chapman Mike ELOs team playing with a lot of momentum and confidence yeah and look at this motion here they kind of run this Boomerang motion it kind of gets huzzy out of sorts and then Carolina responds to kind of cover for huzzy and it it left the Gap open in the Run game smart play call Tim there was a good job on third you mentioned some of the struggles on third down good call there on third down and now starting to threaten heres Waters in the back field now with lus SNAP low lus gathers wants to take it for calhon and it is overthrown huzzy actually was the closest guy to the football partisan Z Keenan want pass interference on Calhoun against Jaylen huy well and they probably have a case now theres holding on Duke but Calhoun turns into the DB and he just tackles H pass number 62 its a 10yd penalty still first down so the hold on Barton right so heres Barton out here working on Evans its kind of a good move and then he kind of gets the hold and then thats the tackle of shorts yeah jaquez Moore back in the game after the holding call you see first and 20 fifth penalty of the night on the Blue Devils lus going to take the Deep shot downfield incomplete and walled off with maai Applause wall ma wall with just one catch for two yards on the season Yep theyre throwing it down the field to him and Wald off is the right term obviously some pressure and then huzzy just a good natural football player good instincts there a good job of Walling him off to the sideline forcing him to run out of room halfway home in the fourth second and 20 for Duke lus again across the middle Calhoun got half of it back and a little more but took a big lick from Chapman on the back end of that deal Chapman with a big hit and calhon coming inside with a lot of Courage good accurate throw once again by lus keeping it in the body of the receiver which certainly helps you coming across the middle and look like I said last time Wes I I do think probably try to get some of it back not necessarily all of it here on third down to go for it potentially on Fourth eight to go for the first down lus again sharp throw caught Calhoun falling down near the first down stick at the 26 yd line and I think hes going to be just shy I think its going be fourth in less than a yard here comes hazley the tight end into the ball game Samir hains comes into the ball game d mullens already on the field ESPN analytics its a green light for Duke I think its got Jordan waterss name written all over it maybe a quarterback Reed with the defense collapses in on him it is Waters and it is a first down tumbles to the 23 thats such a good job of sifting through there doesnt he on on a fourth down play you want to hit it with some momentum its fourth down you know you need a yard but a little bit of patience there as well Tar Hill is shaken up its Cayman Rucker will take took a break night Tim a railroad Bell from the 1940s that right now feels like a Hope Diamond to either team Loftus with Jordan waters on First and 10 and it is Waters circling here to the near side and he gives Duke the Applause lead mty Chapman just loses contain similar to the last touchdown from Jordan Waters where hes able to get outside Giovanni Biggers after the stiff arm didnt even need the stiff arm here just good Vision by Waters Dukes going to end up going for two eight plays 54 yds in 420 and thats the difference between the two Duke touchdowns from Jordan Waters that has brought the Blue Devils and put them back in front their longest run of the day and now trying to make it a threepoint difference twopoint try for Loftus and Duke hell throw caught Calhoun two points for Duke its a threepoint Applause game what a 15pl stretch for Duke Tim really remarkable obviously a lot of it Jordan Waters but how about the route design on the twopoint play as well to give you a little bit of room so I mean you get to the touchdown heres Chapman right here Waters is just going to do this and then Bounce It Outside they just lose contain its a push crack meaning Calhoun the receiver five is going to push up the field and then crack an inside Defender its Biggers there the replace has to come from the corner its Chapman and he just takes a really poor angle so Barton should be excited about it he battles himself back into this football game and then how about the route combination its working Calhoun on a bit of an Arrow Route starts inside snaps it back out and wow here we are so Duke with a threepoint lead North Carolina in their last five games has allowed 58 fourth quarter points after allowing just three in their first five and the Tar Heels who led double figures against Virginia and Georgia Tech Now find themselves playing from behind again here in the fourth at home in Chapel Hill as they did against the Cavaliers and granted now Louisville if they win at Miami theyre going to play Florida State and Charlotte but if Louisville stumbles the winner of this game is part of that inside track him well listen youre sitting at this point you know in your Carolina and youve won seven games like it a pretty good chance still in the mix with a lot of football left and look Duke as well sitting here with six wins quick throw Hampton and he cannot break away from Stenson terrific play by Jaylen Stenson takes Carolina down for a three yd loss on first down yeah Stinson out of the middle of the field comes flying to amarian Hampton and beats the block of Nesbit he lose a couple yards snap to May going to take a deep shot for Walker TZ there its caught in Duke territory goes TZ Walker again without blades defending TZ Walker just has so much speed he can stack the defender when he runs a go route and then that was a really nice job of Drake May taking some air off of it and shooting it kind of driving the ball to TZ 43 yards in the throw and now running on the field catch and bounds the previous plays on the further review wow okay so TZ Walker looking as if really its at the point of the reception I didnt think it was an issue at all once he caught the football maybe going back a little bit further figure out theres at catches of 43 48 and 43 tonight here to the bottom of the screen hes got press man coverage its Bale then TZ just uses his speed to run by Al blades never went out of bounds did he I mean on the route early on thats good on Sundays you just look at this here its catch one two three but did he get knocked out in the first seven yards when he got edged toward the sideline I know I mean well if he got pushed out initially hes reestablished correct pushed out right it was Bale coverage so he really wasnt contacted I dont know why he would have run himself out of bounds unless they have an angle we dont have right so unless he brings himself out of bounds but that would be a weird thing to do really as a receiver youre trying to hold a line to leave your quarterback room to throw the football you see TZ here because Al blades is bailing he just runs I mean hes in bounds here that left foots on the hash mark Thats inbound like and that ones in bounds hes in bounds okay so everything weve seen so far looks like a catch theres no question once the ball gets to him that hes in bounds I think the question may end up being after further review the receiver did not step out of bounds made the catch first down I think thats exactly what what theyre looking at Wes theyre going back to the beginning saying did he just go run himself out of bounds and is I think its fair to look at it was close enough I guess to take a peek at it on such a big play hes got six for 155 four shy of his career high first and 10 in Duke territory for May and the Tar Heels Drake wants to sail it again to The End Zone it is incomplete Brandon Johnson raked it out on a ball for Walker Im tell you this is some kind of play here yeah its also its obviously you know the connection Drake gets flushed outside the pocket he sees TZ kind of take the top off the defense and thats a really good throw and probably a ball that that may wishes Walker was able to come down with because that was right to his left hand pretty good effort there theyre going to give it to Hampton on second in the full 10 and amarian will get five before the whistle blows or the better part of five so itll be third down in five and a half and amarian Hampton has got 141 yards tonight on 25 cars thir and Walker comes back on the field here yeah this with this being a incomplete pass youre talking about a 48 yd field goal I think his ball stays on the ground its a threepoint game inside of four to Applause go duke brings four May slips up working to The Far Side he will dive and have the first down right at the 25 yd line Trey Freeman was able to trip him up think Drake was originally looking to get to TZ Walker on a slant for some reason unlik it but theres no hesitation see how quickly processed it and took off and run thats a really nice play picking up the first down first and 10 pressure coming again May is going to sail it toward the end zone theres a flag thrown on a ball again for Walker Im not sure he was throwing at to Walker tried just to throw it away but nonetheless a flag has come out there were two Blue Devil def Enders Hing Defense number zero fin 10 yd carries an automatic first down it on Chandler Rivers he and Jeremiah Lewis were both back there for El Co team well and you know Drake does a great job of escaping and when he escapes and I think the hold was earlier once TZ saw his quarterback in trouble took off to kind of work for his quarterback and at that point you know grabs the receiver its one of the reasons why a quarterback that can buy a little bit of time and Escape creates so many problems first and 10 Again quick throw and Nate McCollum is the receiver and Duke has got everybody there Johnson led to charge my Heavens I think thats an RPO and a bad decision by Drake I think its a Westley Williams I think was there too and Williams is shaken up on the play and I dont know that this is a cramp or but nonetheless we get a stoppage of play here under three minutes to go and a loss of four on the catch by McCollum Mike Elko is going to use the visit to check on his football player to litigate for his team with Jeff Flanigan well Mike Elco tonight here tonight in year two trying to win this victory bell game for the first time and our Bojangles big bow moment comes from elcos gambles oh its just a little dead spot the return for the return team for Carolina and then it leads to the Jordan Waters touchdown iss just able to bounce it outside and doesnt it felt like a couple times that Carolina was just pulling away yep but you know whether it was you know the onside kick or whether it was couple of fourth down conversions just kind of how youve managed it I think thatve done a good job helping those football teams stay in this game theyve obviously taken the lead and put a little pressure at least on Carol I mean the you just look at the yardage I mean its the kind of like the the quarterback graphic we had at the top of the the show I mean obviously much more accomplished quarterback than Drake may but certainly have fought to stay in this game second and 14 shovel pass Hampton dropped it incomplete now there was traffic there defensively for the Blue Devils but amarian Hampton typically surehanded not there he just drops this and its hard to tell how that was going to be blocked because seemed like RJ openen had a pretty good chance to make that play and now if youre Drake May youve got to be pretty careful here third and forever but you are in field goal range yep May going to throw pump from the pocket shoots it for the end zone and it is caught is it intercepted or is it caught by Nesbit nesbits in a scramble inside the five officials are discussing again and it is intercepted the Blue Devils Joshua picket he got up with the football now theyre talking Jeff Lanigan a discussion with his crew I think that nesb originally CAU this football catch how about this Mike Elco is going to lose his mind here Carolinas going to hurry up and try to run a play What A Catch by Bryson Applause nbon and Mike Elco cannot believe it he thought Joshua pick it had grabbed his second interception of the year and I dont know how theyre not buzzing down to look at Applause this heres the snap the give is to Hampton and hes tackled for No Gain I have no idea why they didnt look at that that that play Were replaying TZ Walker stepping out of bounds I dont know how replay doesnt look at that especially when that ball looks like its moving I think that nesb catches it but Im not sure he still has it when he hits the ground West rivers and that doesnt get replayed yeah heres May again throwing to the end zone copenh with a flag down theres a flag down on the potential touchdown to John copenhaver heres Jeff Flanigan with the call offense number the 53 the 10yd penalty second down to your point Tim it looks like zero Chandler Rivers has a chance at pulling the ball away from nesbet as he makes the catch and I think the ball is starting to move a little bit and so I dont know why were not were not we didnt stop and look at it I dont know how its reviewed that Applause quickly and Carolina got their second penalty of the game so now second and goal at the 15 under two to go now both schools still with three timeouts Applause made a throw shot to the end zone for nesb again he caught it their Flags down its a touchdown for Bryson Applause nesb Carolina has taken in the lead defense on the three de climb play the touchdown not sure hes going to play to game winner he said watching him warm up wasnt sure if hes going to be able to go how effective hed be well how about this catch what a grab and how about the one earlier on Third and long its an amazing throw amazing catch an amazing response by Drake May May throws his first touchdown pass of the Applause night Burnetts point is critical because it makes it a fourpoint game with 155 to go 60th career touchdown pass for Drake may but Tim the discussion point in this game is going to be this throw to nesbet inside the five its really a great throw fitting in in there its a catch originally by Nesbit but that ball looks like it is moving as Chandler Rivers is pulling it out of nesbits hand so before nesbits backside hits the ground is that ball possessed by Nesbit and look there might not be enough to overturn that its not a completion because they ruled it that way on the field but we saw that nesbet did not come out of that scrum the pick it came away with it from with the football correct like that Balls moving I feel like the entire time now listen is there enough to overturn it Im not sure but I certainly think it deserved a long long hard look Carolina back in front and now by four on the 10play drive that ends in the m touchdown to nesi and with Terry Moore shaken up Stenson is deep to take the kick of Liam Boyd and there will not be a return so Grayson Loftus in his second career start will have three timeouts in just under two minutes in another incredible night in the Duke Carolina football rivalry Jaylen Coleman starts with lus off the Blue Devil 25 empty set fourman Rush Carolina Loof his throws and off the hands of Samir Hagens incomplete Applause and the Tara Hills make some changes Here Comes Amari Gainer Here Comes tamari fox in their defensive package I actually think this is the strength for Carolina get those pass Threshers out there and you know let them pin their ears back in these known passing situations I think you know its obviously you know a defense that struggled to stop the run but in this environment I think theyre at their best Carolina bringing the house lus cuts it loose and off the hands of Jordan Moore third down and 10e Marcus Allen the principal Defender for the Tar Heels somewhat surprised that Carolinas playing that aggressively with their Corners that theyre playing a little softer you know up and press man you know you went on a single go route could turn the outcome of this game lotis Moore first down Duke at the 36 nice catch in traffic against Allen 100 seconds left to go heres lus with time now to his right going to dump it down the field and falling out of bounds Blue Devils make the catch and that was Coleman Mike ELOs got three timeouts its a fourpoint game thats the key Wes having the timeouts theres no area of the field that you have to be worried about attacking and well I dont think well see a run its really not out of the realm of possibilities that you might try to hit one Barton moved early Applause now it look like Javari ritzy was he playing Rucker Im sorry its C in Rucker 25 on the end here so Jeff Flanigans crew huddles offside Defense number 25 a 5yd penalty first down clock will start on the snap and Rucker getting ready to threat here his little Flinch comes before Bartons its actually a smart play by Barton I think he saw it and reacted to it yeah Waters now into the game with lus hes had two huge runs for touchdowns here in the fourth Straight Ahead Waters first down and more hurdles a man at the 35 Duke at Carolinas 33 now with 121 to play its just a great effort this what I mean about just kind of popping a run hitting it because you know youre in a situation where you can call some timeouts but the defensive line is is rushing the passer and because of a Carolina injury on the play Duke doesnt have to use one of their timeouts tamari Fox being checked out with 121 to go in a fourpoint game a year ago Carolina had to drive the field May through to Antoine green to win it for Carolina in the last seconds at Wallace Wade and Duke may have that very chance here Applause tonight and of course the Blue Devils have the football and the play by Chandler Rivers on Bryson NWI with Joshua picket over there can now just be pushed down the line here a little bit Carolina was able to score on the Nesbit touchdown and now Duke and the fourpoint difference means in order to win this the Blue Devils have to have a Applause touchdown some kind of ball game tonight huh I mean Waters again into the Stop rolls around to the 30 gain of three Don Chapman The Tackle Clock Works toward a minute to go Elco with all three timeouts likewise for m Applause brown snap to lus Carolina only rings three lus and trying to throw it its caught more but he was out of Bounds at the 13 covered over there by Marcus Applause Cala for me its calhon is the guy you got to try to get the football to if youre Duke this third down let him work the middle of the field I feel like thats where Loft this kind of had the most success in terms of seeing it delivering accurate throws going to have a trip set to the bottom of the screen with the inside most player being Calhoun Jaylen Coleman in the back field Carolina bringing pressure lus throws batted away tar Hills got a hand in it it looked like was that DJ Jones or Elijah huzzy huzzy 28 got the hand in the throwing Lane yep and it looked like huzzy kind of came off of Calhoun fell in front of haggens had a bad route distribution for Duke two players in the same area now a have to have it situation here on four and S down mulling the tight end has gone to the boundary side and now M Browns called a timeout came all the way down to the in line to our left time out to get this call North Carolina First Chars time out timeout will be 30 seconds Im going to tell you what I would do right now if Im m brown I would I would want to play Drop eight youve got a A Young quarterback that has been told kind of all week we dont want negative plays we dont want negative plays stay on schedule but now you find yourself in this weird environment where its Fourth and seven and so if you rush three you want to hold the ball as long as you can and try to find a window right I think its just a way to have a Young quarterback in a situation like this and fool him trick him you know and create tight small Windows because youve got so many guys in coverage and so and on top of that you know if you end up rushing Evans Murphy and Rucker theres still a decent chance you can end up getting home yeah well and again youve said this Calhoun your best option but youve also found some room in the Run game tonight too Tim here in this fourth quarter yeah you have and you know I dont think you can risk you know trying to pop a run in this environment but Id be surprised if Carolina comes after Duke I would play coverage so here is fourth and seven tar Hills crowding that box Coleman in the back field snap pressure coming Loftus throws looking in zone its caught Jordan Moore its why you dont do it its why you dont do it all all out Blitz Duke has taken the lead with 41 seconds left to go in the ball game all out pressure on Fourth and seven it it it clears it up for the quarterback you see all out pressure its catch and throw its theres no decision that needs to be made youre not reading the coverage you just see it its catch and throw Pino now to make it a threepoint game and the kick is good Jordan Applause Mo this is what I mean these are the safety players theyre coming in so just take a look at this man man man man nobody else all the quarterback has to do is identify the matchup he wants its a little stutter go to the top and its catch and throw thats what I mean about not having to read a defense it takes the decision out of it for you Im shocked that they decided to come after him and Jordan Moore responds with his fifth tou down catch of the year and Grayson lus how about you young man how about you in some ways the night of the Young quarterback from Gaffney South Carolina mirrors his head coach doesnt it just keep scrapping and fighting and trying to find a way and now with 41 seconds left Duke whos got 209 fourth quarter yards of offense has taken the lead Music now listen two timeouts in 41 seconds for Drake May to get in the field goal range he not crazy therell be no return Carolina will go from its 25 dont forget stay tuned after the ball game full coverage of week 11 in the ACC live interviews and Analysis from here in Chapel Hill on acc huddle everybodys bundled up and ready to go into the night across the way my goodness what a game this has been and now in what is possibly his last appearance in Keenan Stadium Drake May is 75 yds away from a touchdown or moving Carolina in position to kick a field goal heres May up in the pocket and throws for the far sideline line and now a flag comes in on a ball intended for Bryson nesb stops the clock with 35 seconds left Matt Brown has two Applause timeouts passing the fer Defense number three ball be plac at the spot of the foul first down Brandon Johnson guilty for the blue doubles so Carolina the ball 38 yd line 35 seconds and two timeouts for the Tar Heels May cuts it loose and he got hit as he let it go and McCollum and Walker with the two tar Hills on the throw line here once again RJ oin with a decent little spin move back inside and then its Peebles who do a good job of just kind of collapsing the pocket gets a piece of May forces the inaccurate throw Duke only rushes three heres May to his right hell throw it is caught short of the first down and banged out of bounds was Hampton by rivers in Sten it so 22 seconds left I think the big thing here is you know you want chunk plays but got to pick up the first Music down heres May on third down Loops it for Hampton first down for Carolina to the 46 of dup m brown a timeout stops the clock with 16 seconds left so now in plus territory the line would be about the 30 1 for Todd Pino because that would be his season long is 48 at pit or Noah Bernett by the way I said top Pino thats Dukes kicker whos obviously won the weight game but Noah Bernett made a 48 against pit a 43 y last week here against Campell now this a good timeout by m brown here as well obviously you know ball in bounds but they did pick up the first down but calling that timeout got tired receivers in this environment who you know whove been running down the field let them catch their breath youre also preserving that last timeout because you dont want to have to run out onto the field in a Mayday situation to try to kick the game tying field goal that being said everything is still at your disposal in terms of working the middle of the field would you prefer the sideline certainly but you can throw to the middle of the field shallow cross a TZ there it is Walker crossing the field at the 40 and gets out of Bounds at the 38 Chandler Rivers tripped him up Tim n seconds left how many snaps you got before you got to worry about the field goal well listen you have two more plays for sure as long as you dont run around and waste a bunch of time so youve got a play on time this could also be you know a surrender situation from the standpoint of catch the football and declare yourself down so you could then call the timeout if its in the middle of the field heres May quick shot neit the catch got to go down got to go down got to go down down theres the timeout call m brown 3 seconds left Carolina calls their second timeout so their second time out of the drive third overall out of timeouts now Barnetts got a kick for the time yeah thats why you dont want Nesbit fighting for that extra yardage you want him to go down so that you can call your timeout eventually he does its a pretty well orchestrated drive by Drake May going to be right in the neighborhood of 43 yards for Noah Bernett to tie the game and send it to overtime Mike ELOs got timeouts now hes got a whole pocket full of them and hes getting ready to start using Music them and the first one getting ready to be called here in just a second it is 42 just inside the 43 yd Mark theres the timeout called for by coelo thats number one how many I dont know but Noah Bernett is kicking to the same end of the field where a year ago against NC State in the final game he missed a field goal that would have kept that game alive Music and now in his final home game at Kean Stadium because he was announced on senior day before the game this young man from over and Raleigh is trying to send Duke in Carolina to overtime for the second time in Series Applause history so here is Bernett to get it to Overtime or Duke will win kick is away and it is good and Duke Carolina is going to overtime in Chapel Hill just inside the right upright we go to overtime in Chapel Hill quick look Carolina won the toss their playing defense heres GR R and lus and Duke and Jaylen Coleman going to flip it back to Moore on the reverse is he going to throw he was looking to throw and instead Don Chapman and Gio Biggers wrap him up so Duke gives back a few yards on the first play looked like they were trying to find something toward Calhoun in the end zone yeah and it was Eliza huzzy who did an excellent job of diagnosing it and he stayed with Calhoun otherwise could have been a first play of overtime touchdown by Duke theres Rucker lurking now on second and 14 lus wants to get rid of it quick shoots it to Coleman and an open field Tackle by Cedric gray wow Applause pretty good play by the linebacker its a great play by the linebacker because he gets out there and hes got to make the tackle and I think you got to be really careful here with the Young quarterback third and 13 you dont need to get all of it I mean you may feel like you do but you dont need to you hope that he has that knowledge in his head because got the ability to obviously still kick a field goal in this first overtime third down and 14 and theyre going to run it with Coleman to the far side and a flag goes down as will hardy pushes him out of Bounds at the 19 is this a hold on Duke and that would be devastating for Duke because now move the ball back to the 40 holding offense number 62 its a 10y penalty third down theyre going to get Graham Barton on this he didnt seem to agree with the call here he is out here third wow Applause yeah so now third and 24 and you are Pinos hit a 52 y against NC State at home so youre out of his range right now lus up in the pocket sneaks to the 35 and down to the Applause 31 so the Pino 52 y now youre back inside that number 10 but not by much no not by much but I think this is what you have to do fourth and forever if youre near his range I think you have to try it and they certainly are 49 for Applause Pino in the first overtime kick is away and it is good 49 with juice for Todd Pino and Duke in front by three this looked like it was good from 59 yep wow so were in the first overtime Carolina getting ready to take over at Dukes 25 tar Hills won the toss they took defense each team gets from the opponents 25 for the first two overtimes in the second overtime if they score a touchdown they got to go for two and then after that if theyre still tied through two overtimes alternating twopoint conversions until we have a winner so heres Drake May thear heels a touch down will win the game May to Hampton and am Marian Hampton moves the stack three on first down May got his 12th career 300yd passing game tonight on 27 of 41 and Hamptons got 144 yds on 27 carries but Carolina still needs more in order to get their eighth win of the year because of some of the Red Zone struggles earlier in the night you think about that obviously this is what overtime is set up for May going to flip it here on the nearest side thats Hampton again knocked out of Bounds at the8 yd line and here we go Tim first and goal at the Duke eight for Carolina 13 yd throw and its certainly been a problem area tonight for Carolina offensively and you think to where theyve had some success it was getting to the perimeter actually it wasnt going right at Duke you know kind of North and South between the tackle runs it was stuff on the edge May goes under Center again going to shovel it away to Hampton hell turn the corner at the five out of bounds near the three thats what I mean these perimeter play right a little pitch outside to get a bunch of bodies out there and then you get the big back Hampton just getting his shoulders Square thats a good pickup on first down down in this tyght especially when you consider the struggles that weve seen so far tonight May in the gun again with Hampton a touchdown will win it for the Tarheels heres Hampton no May will keep it to his right and ends up being socked by Jeremiah Lewis now its third and goal I think this ends up being a play that should have been a give Lewis is outside there its contained I dont know why Drake felt like he needed to pull it so tez Walker will go to the left here nesbet and McCollum to the right Tim so heres the thing tez normally plays on the right side so theres obviously something they have planned for him but if he gets doubled then youve got to be looking elsewhere 18 and six are those players theres May the fake he will throw to the end zone McCollum can hang Applause on and now Carolina will kick the field goal its a little whip route that Carolina used to like to run with Josh DS and he wins balls there just needs to be finished its a great route throws on the hands that would have won the game now heres Noah Bernett to try and make his sixth field goal to tie of the game snap spot kick is up and we move on at 39 all so Nate McCollum had a a little bit like quarterbacks sometimes youre a wide receiver you just got to flush it and move on to the next one Nate McCollum had a chance to potentially win the game on the third down throw from May instead Noah Bernett kicks his school record tying six field goal of the night hes ties a 1999 Mark of six field goals by Josh McGee ironically against Duke for Carolina and now may and the tar Hills will be on offense first here in the second overtime and weve moved to the other end of the Keenan Stadium Field theys got Hampton with him and hell get the ball on first down and am Marians got five six its almost seven before Jamon Franklin pulls him back is Cal second and four I might just let 28 run it a few times here well would not be surprised because they picked up six on first down if they come back to that especially with Morales in the game instead of Nesbit at tight end yep big front heres Hampton hes got the first down crashed inside the 15 to the 13 Trey Freeman The Tackle and Carolina starting to move people here in front yeah its just this ones really well blocked weve talked about this front being disruptive for Duke all night but first two plays of this second overtime done a really nice job creating running lanes for Maran Hampton they hand it to him a third straight time here goes Hampton on first down and he breaks inside the five itll be second and short at the four and a half Trey Freeman another topen if Im chip Lindsay Im just slowing it down a little bit enough to let Hampton catch his breath after three straight carries and handing it to him again handing it to him again career high 31 carries tonight for Marian Hampton May the clap hell move the pocket to the right Drake will keep it and score how about that may turn the corner and then kind of had enough momentum built in his run Tim to fall into the end zone and its quarterback sweep now you get Hampton who weve seen his power tonight hes a lead blocker yeah I made a bit of a a Josh Allen comparison earlier on a fourth down play stuff like that that theres elements of that in his game and now a twopoint try for Carolina and it looks like were going to get a pretty unique quad set kind of formation you got an isolation down on the bottom of your screen to Nesbit looks like hes potentially getting doubled Dukes got four on the line heres May looking right now going to scoop back up throw to the end zone thats caught copenh twopoint play for Carolina and now an eightpoint lead at 4739 this its a great play by Drake may he gets caught I think it was a designed quarterback draw but this is insane the referees missed this they got legal Man Down field Willie lamin is 5 yds deep into the end zone take a look at the Right Guard I believe its the Right Guard Drakes going to take off to run I mean hes well in the end zone he tries to hide he kind of crouches down like hes going to hide he knows hes down the field its an outstanding effort by Drake May weve seen him do it a few times obviously on the touchdown designed quarterback run a good job of being physical on the way into the end zone and then on the twopoint play much like the lefthanded throw we saw a few weeks back where he was trying to create but the playground aspect of his game is fascinating yeah its incredible the playground aspect is Applause incredible so now here is lus needing the touchdown and the two for Duke to stay in it thats more in motion Straight Ahead Coleman and hes turned back after a four yd gain on first down by Desmond Applause Evans boy the 110th meeting for the victory bell is delivered tonight somehow or another we find these games where they empty the T second and six thats hazley the tight end setting up theyre going to hand the ball to Coleman again and now were down to Third and about three on the Cedric gray tackle of Jaylen Music Coleman you think you know what weve seen is weve seen Carolina defensively continue to be aggressive and come after lus Music Jaylen Coleman stays in the game with Loftus and it looks like may get an aggressive look once again going to hand the ball to Coleman and he will reach but not get toward the first down Mark at the 15 power Eckles shut the run down and now all of a sudden fourth in the ball game for Elco yeah thats just a good job of meeting in the hole and kind of winning at the point of contact dont hate to call on third down though for Duke though knowing that fourth down youre going for it now with fourth and a yard maybe even less than a yard certainly a lot that you can do here fourth and go fourth and one thats Calhoun in motion snap the lus hell go to the left throw its caught and this is more and its first and goal Duke now at the Carolina six its a really good decision by lus theyre running a sprint out trying to get the flat but if they dont get the flat they also have that little shovel pass to Calhoun but because more at outflank the defense just go ahead and give him the football nice decision good read good throw good pick up on fourth down so first and goal Duke at the six Carolina leading by eight Duke needs a touchdown in a two to keep the game alive lus hands to Coleman right side trying to bounce to the perimeter tar Hills rally Don Chapman his final game at Keenan stadium makes a play in space a nice job of making sure you cant bounce it outside thought really probably should have put pushed this one up inside tries to bounce it and Chapman speed able to get there Calhoun and haggens to The Far Side more to the near Applause side theyre going to hand to Coleman no throwing to the end zone and caught thats more the slant for Jordan Moore and the Duke touchdown Grayson Loftus threw a seed in there Tim same exact play we saw the touchdown on earlier just the other side and a good job of keeping it in the body of more guys running Slants when its in their body they catch it extend it over their head they typically dont good job on that back shoulder Duke ran the twopoint play earlier in the ball game and now heres lus with three touchdown passes tonight in his second career start trying to tie the game throws in zone no and thats it Carolina keeps the Victory Bell in double Applause overtime
