today we just received confirmation NC State still not back to full strength only nine guys dressed and available to play today DJ thunderberg the big man and the Freshman cam Hayes the notable absences for the wolf pack Campbell in Black NC State in white our officials this afternoon Bill Covington Ry Stein and Justin Porter field as we are underway in PNC Arena NC State starts with the POs as they open the first time you look at the starting five this is the first time playing at PNC Arena so far this season they go right to bats everything but the Finish there for the sophomore take a look at the Campbell starting five they remain unchanged to the team that lost to Elon the fighting camels first loss of the season pull up pop and it goes down a great start for the fighting camels on the road yeah anytime you play against NC State you have to be mindful of their steals they want to try to pressure you create some turnovers then get out in transition youre right thats a great start for Campbell every starter for NC State played more than 34 minutes with some tired legs on a quick turn around for the wolf pack that rattles in and out no good Austin mull on the three attempt dein Daniels weaving through the Campbell defense and hes called for an offensive foul it was Mulla who got back for the charge Kevin Keats not happy with that Keats in year number four three straight Seasons with 20 or more wins to start his NC State tenure thats just impressive what hes been able to do uh most times teams youre taking over a program uh you dont get to that number uh as quick quickly as he has and you Ill say it again three straight Seasons with 20 or more wins pretty impressive what hes done thus far with this NC State program and now playing shorthanded again without DJ thunderberg or Cam Hayes two big pieces of this Wolfpack team Jericho ham pull up pop doesnt fall Music for NC State when youre playing against Camp they run a Princeton style offense so back door cuts and movement is going to be something were going to watch throughout this game they do an excellent job running their Music offense opening four possessions for the wolf pack two turnover and still looking for points in the early going wide open three Braxton Beverly cant knock it downa dishes it off blocked it wasnt Manny Bates who got a piece of that CU if it was that would mean block number 100 still waiting for the official stat there might have been guys on NC State who got a piece of it I believe it was Bates and we talked about him at the open a guy that can impact the game with his defense its just remarkable the numbers hes put up it baits there again we did get confirmation that was block number 100 fastest ACC player to 100 career blocks in more than 20 years and on the other end Jericho Helms opens the scoring for the wolfback and again go back to Manny Bates although he wont get credit for a block on that previous possession you might as well call it a block because he changed and authored the shot and thats what he brings to this NC State team elite rim protector Cedric Henderson Junior contested shot misses thats now six straight misses for Campbell after making the opening shot of the game ellam tries a three that rattles in and out no good I think the strategy for NC State needs to be getting the ball into the paint as we take a look at a charge on their first possession they went down low the baits he wasnt able to score but I think you got to continue to try to pound the ball down low in the paint and theres Kevin mcgean in year number eight is head coach of the fighting camels they won the big South regular season in 2019 but coach Bean only has three players left from the roster that won the league two years ago so trying to get it done with a much different team the foul called on the floor and weve only got four points four minutes into it just getting started in Raleigh on the ACC Network our new house is amazing great Street huge yard there is a bit of an issue with our neighbors fencing we just saw Manny Bates block his 100th career block to find the only two guys to do it faster in the accs history you got to go back to Georgia Tech Alvin Jones in 1998 and then before that Tim Duncan in 1986 we wanted to show you the transformation that Manny Bates has made as hes compiled those 100 blocks this is him a year go and now Malcolm he has completely changed his body and it is paying dividends in a big way as he leads the country in Block shots I mean just wow you look at that transformation we spoke with Kevin ke yesterday and he just said look Ive been so impressed by the work that he has put in and Im not surprised by the block shot number I think the big surprise for them though has been the improved offensive numbers for Manny baits last season only averaged Five Points a game hes up in double digits this season and anytime your name gets mentioned with Tim Duncan in terms of accomplishing anything on a basketball court you know youre doing something pretty special uh its been Elite uh in terms of the defensive efficiency that hes put up and what he provides on the back end of that NC State Defense and you think about what hes had to go through in his personal basketball career he missed nearly a thousand days between his junior year of high school and making his NC State debut last season missed his senior year high school then red shirted for the wolf pack in his first year in Raleigh he gets the feed inside splits a double team did he beat the shot clock Manny Bates that is the question the officials will take take a look at this but when you look at Manny bats story youd be hard pressed to find a better one with everything hes battled through and now playing the best basketball of his career and Kevin Keats and staff said look hes finally healthy they had to manage uh his workload last year even lifting uh was a struggle with his shoulder and again this year finally healthy and obviously you can see the improved numbers and obviously of the physique the transformation that he made during uh his off seon would love to get another look at this we were just talking about him and for good reason after he made some history already in this game on the defensive end as you said Malcolm you just pointed out a minute ago hes really worked on his offensive game but did he get this shot off it was a great move in the post to split two Defenders just dont know if it left his hands before it hit zeros and I think the big key for NC State in this game they have not had success from the perimeter but I think getting the ball down low in the paint this is a patient possession right here Ren a high ball screening then Dove Manny baits down to to the great post position its tough right there from that angle it almost is too difficult to tell whether or not it was still in his hand it happened so fast but nonetheless certainly was good offense by NC State now the question is is where they able to get it off in time the official underneath the basket called it a good bucket in real time so I guess the question is is there enough evidence to truly overruled that Manny bit still had his fingers on the ball when there were zeros on the shot clock and we are told the basket will stand so paying off a great story about Manny baits in his transformation and overcoming the injuries here in NY State with two points underneath this is the key right here for Campbell against NC State handling their full court pressure and as I said theyre one of the most efficient offensive teams in the Big South Ricky Clemens on the drive floats one over the reaching hand of Manny Bates and it drops home first bucket in more than four and a half minutes for Campbell beautiful move by Clemens that time body control used his leverage and then got it up over Manny Bates excellent spacing by Campbell ellams left open but cant cash in watch the back door cuts of Campbell and then theyre spacing on offense again clean look they came into this game averaging 84 points a game and theyre eighth nationally shooting 54 from the floor so a very efficient offensive team and I think the key number for them early on Jay theyve been good on the defensive class and NC State fires right back in front Shaquille Moore The Freshman makes his first shot of the game Music hob strips it away on the other end and thatll be a jump Music ball now remember this is a Wolfpack team that played late on Thursday night in St Louis it was their first game since December 3rd so a two we layoff and they only have nine guys to play with Kevin keatss team so how will the quick turnaround with some tired legs every starter played 34 minutes or more handled his Campbell team today Jesus carero darts into the lane puts it up and in another beautiful move again uh because their spacing Campbell is so excellent on offense uh the help is late because theyre spread out all over the floor and then theyre showing some 34 qut pressure and then theyre dropping back into a 32 Zone Devin Daniels for three cant hit it they R A Campbell basketball underneath looks like they changed it back to NC State ball Alam gives it right back with the travel we spoke with Kevin Keats you know we asked him about the time off and obviously everybody dealing with the ups and downs of Co and certainly it impacted him obviously nine players have you talked about and it certainly seems like theres going to be some fatigued legs count it plus the foul a great feed inside and the Lithuanian freshman get him as mois gets the hoop and the harm a beautiful back door cut by Mo mcus and this is the thing right here Jay back door Cuts again theyre going to try to use NC States aggression in the passing lane and then theyre going to set up back door Cuts thats something that NC state has to be mindful of all game long against Campbell you mentioned the tired legs that NC State has well St Louis ended that game on Thursday on a 324 run only travel nine guys to play the bilic and only have the same nine available today against Campbell and its a twopoint lead early for the fighting camels take a look at the minutes that this Wolfpack team played on Thursday way above their season average and those starters guys that played all those minutes as we take a look at a beautiful back cut uh had a day off yesterday really just got some shots up and you know Kevin Keats was concerned about the fatigue Factor so again not much running they just put some shots up once they got inside PNC Arena as a former player Malcolm what was the key to the quick turnaround the back to backs well again theyre young I wish I could be that young again uh but I think the big thing is and as Kevin Keith talked about he got a chance to watch some film with them again he didnt want to make any excuses he didnt want to hear anything about fatigue or lack of practice time he said look I just think our guys didnt play well uh and again we needed to get in to the gym get some shots up but I think the biggest thing is is getting the film room and kind of go over some of the mistakes that he felt were being made in that St Louis game another turnover for NC State thats now four in this first half the fighting camels are four for their last four trying to make it five for five here denied by Manny Bates theres a reason why hes the top black getter in the country now the officials have paused the game to take a look at something at the monitor well while the officials take a look at the monitor we will step aside its 1111 here between NC State and Campbell Manny bats making some history in the black Department today the sophomore continuing to get it done for the wolf hey yo welcome to the new Chris Paul workout show if you want to make it to the NBA you got to have a killer cross before the break the officials stopped mid play because the shot clock reset on a Manny baits block when it should not have so itll start with Campbell basketball in 13 seconds on that shot clock great take away by the wolf pack they look to score in transition heres Devin Daniels LS it up for Manny Bates and its Campbell basketball fifth turnover in the first nine minutes for NC State great day for college basketball on the ACC Network after us you got Buffalo and Syracuse at six and then night UCF against number 15 Florida State just a great sports day in General you got the ACC Championship at football going on right now three great basketball games on the network so get that remote ready to go this is Jordan Whitfield on the drive feeds it off for an easy two Josh lucain Cashes in and puts Campbell back up by two and thats how you attack a rim protector go right into him see if you can draw him away and then dis to his guy Applause early on Campbell has controlled the pace and limited their turnovers right here Manny Bates trying to do a dribble hand off yeah again just moved his body in and thats certainly a foul that you do not want to see Manny Bates pick up trying to set a ball screen NC State now has six turnovers on only five made baskets thats not a good combination contested three goes becking Devin danels draws the foul Daniels at a rare off game against St Louis on Thursday night five of 16 from the floor zero for six from three and he fouled out and Kevin Keats talked about those numbers again guys are a little out of rhythm I think thats what he needs to do continue to try to get the ball going towards the basket dont settle for jumpers of where youve struggled early on try to get yourself to the lane or to the free throw line 10 minutes into the first half and its the first time that the Wolfpack find themselves at the down line today hams makes the first now NC State goes to a 221 full court press great drive just right into the teeth of that NC State Defense and another foul called against the rim protector Manny Bates thats his second foul in about two minutes and so often when you go up against a shot blocker like Manny Bates guys try to fade away or avoid the contact uh Campbell right now is early on is doing a nice job attacking his body trying to go right at him either try to get a foul draw and then dish off to whoever it is hes guarding excellent game plan early on by Music Campbell so bat Subs out with two fouls two blocks and two points Campbells done an excellent job of the first 10 minutes of this game controlling the tempo and taking NC State out of rhythm and now they go back to manto man but its almost like a Zone where theyre packing it in theyre allowing anything to go on the perimeter for NC State in terms of perimeter jumpers but theyre closing off the lane and not allowing much dribble ation another turnover thats now seven in his first half for the wolf pack 5 Seconds to shoot this is Ricky Clemens pass off deep three Thompson no Music good Coast to Coast taking it rims out for the Freshman Shaquille Moore everything but the Finish there and nobody there to protect the rim with Manny baits out of the game get him as moek as Cashes in and its a fourpoint lead for the fighting camels time out Kevin Keats and Campbell has come in the PNC Arena and grabbed a lead in this first Music half people love the hurricane the number one selling cane from coast to coast I love my hurricane I love how secure I feel with my hurricane they love how team has come into the wolf packs home and in their first game in PNC Arena Malcolm Huckabee what has Campbell done to take the wolf pack out of their rhythm in this first half started with their defense theyre not giving up any dribble penetration at all theyre allowing North Carolina state to shoot from the perimeter then offensively theyve been patient and then theyve run their offense back door cuts and theyre getting high percentage shots early on another offensive foul that one goes against Jericho Helms and you can see Jay again they have two three bodies in the paint every time NC State tries to dribble Drive they are not allowing anything or any shots uh in the key area right now NC State theyre going to have to either be a little bit more patient or start knocking down some perimeter jumpers because right now Campbell is just packing it in daring him shoot from the perimeter the wolf pack came into the afternoon only turning the ball over 97 times a game they already have eight and we still have more than eight minutes left in this first half eight turnovers only five made baskets and that is not a winning combination and Campbell continues to capitalize Josh lucain rocks the rim and its the largest lead of the game six for the fighting Applause Music camels Braxton Beverly tough take for two much needed bucket for NC State that was one of the few times they were able to get inside the heads up play by Beverly but the problem now has been defensively the Campbell has have been able to execute and then get high percentage shots its all set up by their spacing and then back door cuts tries a three and he hits it Josh lucain the sophomore backto back baskets to put Campbell up Applause seven well dont look now but Josh lucain in the fighting camels giving NC State they can handle a dunk then a three and the fighting camels leading by seven guys how how does NC State cut into this lead Mal well they need more of that yeah they need more of that right there patience get the ball on the key but I think the turnovers have been an issue they have eight turnovers right now in the first half and credit what Campbell has done they packed in and then they force some turnovers against this NC State Applause offense and that time it was Etsy State creating the turnover instead of falling victim to it Music Evan Daniels passes out of the double team wide open Lane jayen Gibson drove right into it but another offensive foul thats now three charges taken by Campbell this afternoon and nine turnovers for the wolf pack and thats one right there Gibson needs to do come to a jump stop jumper defense is waiting right there either thats got to be a kick out or a little jump stop floater again Campbell doing a nice job throwing bodies in front of NC State players every time they try to drive the ball to the hole Devin Daniels ripped that one over away takes it right to the rim but he missed it now a triple team on Helm he throws it into traffic its knocked away well this has been the story of the first half right here again looks like theyre going to have a wide open dunk and excellent recovery and Music block Beverly high off the glass doesnt fall now the question becomes how long does coach ke leave Manny Bates on the bench another takeaway this time its Beverly kick out Daniels at three and knock it down wide open thats a shot Devin Daniels usually Music hits look at the spacing that Campbell has on offense a wide open Lane he missed the dunk though Cedric Henderson Jr couldnt slam it home back the other way Miss on the other Daniels there for the offensive rebound and finally he puts it off the window and in thats great work by Daniels on the offensive glass in transition again thats going to be NC States I believe formula in this game theyre struggling shooting the ball from the perimeter get stops on defense and then get out in transition and crash the offensive glass and one Jordan Whitfield the Raleigh native gets the bucket and the foul well right now again thats just a dribble drive a poor defense by Helms and then you compound it by with with a reach and foul help is late played his high school basketball 8 miles down the road from NC States campus at milbrook high school fou called on the rebound against carolo Music hels left open and he hits it much needed bucket for Jericho hels that might have been one of their best offensive possessions in the first half ball went left to right nice dribble Drive Baseline by Beverly extra pass for a open jumper would field too much on that pass looking for carolo Campbell still leading by three as we step aside NC State trying to get over the hump the Huddle on acc Network nobody covers the ACC like we do you can join the guys right after the completion of Syracuse and buffalo on the ACC Network right now its Clemson 7 Notre Dame three at the end of the first quarter over on ABC NC States having trouble right now Campbell controlling a threepoint lead nearing halftime the wolf pack playing with only nine guys available to them today five players missing DJ thunderberg and cam Hayes the notable absences and its the same nine guys that traveled to St Louis and just played two nights ago on the road so Kevin Keats program with some tired legs and now in a dog fight with a Campbell team that is looking to put the wolf pack on upset alert this afternoon and when we spoke with Kevin ke he said look I dont want to make any excuses he didnt want to hear anything about TI leg or us being uh shorthanded but you know certainly Jay it has impacted how theyve played early on and obviously the way they want to play but they dont have much depth now before that St Louis game game on Thursday night Kevin Keats team had not played in a game since December 3rd again a game against UMass so you go two weeks without playing to now two games in 48 hours you take a look at the five games that were postponed or canell in that time and tired legs Rusty legs a combination of the two and only nine players available as NC State battling with three minutes left in this first Music half Malala in the corner he hits the three Austin Mulla the senior buries the triple thats a huge one look like Campbell was stalling a little bit Music offensively and jerich Cole ham Helms immediately answers thats what you need if youre NC State just punch right back it is and I think again a continued de pressure obviously weve talked about the depth issues but this is who NC State is they want to try to wear you down and a foul called inside Cedric Henderson Jr heads to the line Henderson Jr the son of Cedric Henderson who played in the NBA for the Warriors and the Cavaliers Music and the coaching staff of Campbell really Rave about what he brings to the table very good passer guy that theyre going to depend on a lot though to score some points for him that last game against Elon 12 points four boards and certainly one of the better players in the Big South straight to the Rack in attack mode dein Daniels ties it to 28 90 seconds left in the half the wolf pack looking for their first lead since it was 9 to8 Beverly off the rim how about that for an assist Darion sebron in perfect position to grab that ball and Hammer it home well the question is does Beverly get the assist for that one right there or does the rim but its been that type of first half but if youre Kevin ke you have to be pleased for as poorly as youve played your team now is up to and certainly uh something that they needed that last bucket they need to have anything positive going into the second half shot clock kicking down two on the timer Clemens doesnt realize it and thats a shot clock Applause violation well this right here again Im not sure if hes going to get an assist for that but a needed break for NC State Beverly was trying to kick that ball out to the opposite corner and they finally get a bounce that goes their way heres Thomas Allen blocked from behind transfer from Nebraska is been quiet in his first half and a timeout taken by Campbell North Carolina State on a 156 run as halime looms near whats been the difference in the way the wolf pack has played during this run Malcolm well theyve just been resilient I I think you know theyve shot the ball poorly in the first half you look at it uh they were two of eight two of eight right now from the threepoint line uh 25 44 from the floor but theyre defense if theyve stayed Relentless defensively and then theyve been able to get stops get out in transition and get some easy buckets I think thats been the key for them because obviously they have not shot the ball well in the first half and if youre the camels of Campbell and Kevin mcgean you have played really well in this first half to go into halftime in a one possession game if they can get a stop here yeah again theyve played well theyve had some really nice offensive possessions limited obviously uh any second chance points for NC State they got Manny baits in foul trouble early on in this game so again uh you still have to feel good if youre Campbell going into the half 10 seconds to shoot heres Beverly pull up three rattles in and out no good gamble still has 10 seconds until halftime Henderson Jr a three thats off the mark and who did it go off of last they say it was the Lithuanian Mo second who touched it and that gives the wolf pack 26 seconds at the end of this first half oh Beverlys got range he will heave it and no good so NC State takes a twopoint lead into halftime Campbell has given the wolf pack everything they can handle and more in this first half yeah and again if youre NC State you have to be pleased youre going into the half uh besides playing poorly uh you still have a twopoint lead uh certainly though theyre going to have to shoot the ball better in the second half if youre Campbell youre going to have to tighten it up with some of the turnovers that you had late in the first half LC State underman only nine guys dressed and available and clinging to a twopoint lead at the break closing out the half on a 156 run when we started our business we were paying like an arm in a leg the Manny bats in North Carolina State ready to start this second half against Campbell Credit the the camels they LED for much of that first half a big reason why Manny Bates was off the floor from the 1030 Mark so the sophomore back on with two fouls as we are underway in this second half and the Wolf Pack starts with the basketball Thomas Allen leaves that three short baits there for the follow put in for two excellent offensive possession Beverly nice dribble Drive Baseline and then baits on the offensive glass but Jay Im going to say it again I think thats where they need to attack dont settle for jumpers try to get the ball down low in particular with baits out on the court they certainly missed their rim protector for the final 10 minutes of the first half but hes provided a spark this season on the offensive end as well we just saw it there an instant impact to start this second half lets see if they get him a touch in the paint he sets the pick count it plus the foul driving right into the defense Devin Daniels and hell head to the line to complete the and one Daniels had six in that first half thats tough right there again that refs on a different angle than were looking so it might have been sliding over to his left and excellent start of the second half for NC State and even with the missed foul shot its still the largest wolf pack lead of the game at six inside to Josh L thats an easy flush for the sophomore Campbell continues to attack even with baites in the game theyre drawing him off of his Defender Daniel trying to go behind the back to bait Beverly there to clean it up great pass from hams unlocks Allen who drains the three Thomas Allen the r native he will make you pay if you leave him open much needed three beautiful ball Movement by NC State lets go let gohing in with some great defense as well point lead for the wolf pack boy malcol this looks like a different team to start the second half well this was the concern for Campbell when we spoke with Coach M Le yesterday that he said look NC States pressure we must handle it and limit the turnovers ACC football championship going on right now some great basketball all around the country including two more games on the ACC Network after off Syracuse and buffalo and then you c f against Florida State the night cap with the Huddle at 800 PM recapping the ACC football championship so keep it on the ACC Network all day long Malcolm hucke Jay alter with you Campbell cuts into that 92 start for NC State they have looked terrific to start this second half they really have NC State again a better ball movement but I think thats the area again though Manny baits theyre going to get him with a hook wow that is a tough break for NC State and Kevin keeps not happy at all looked like Manny Bates was trying to get position lets see okay pin down oh man thats a thats a tough call right there hes just trying to establish post position and Bates missed the final 10 minutes and 30 seconds of the first half after he picked up his second foul thats his third and Kevin Keats is furious with the turnovers you see the fourth year head coach slapped the floor after ellams gave that one away in the 11th turnover of the game for the wolf pack thats two more than their season average Anderson Jr pull up three short bounces out to hels hes the games leading scorer with 13 he lost it again thats a 12th turnover Campbell trying to capitalize and they do count it plus the foul Ricky Clemens coming up huge for the camels oh the defense right here again poor decision turnover there off and then this is his great body control Little Euro Step and then finish with the left hand thats a tough finish through contact for Clemens and Ricky Clemens no relation to Chris Clemens who of course is a legend in in Campbells program his number three already retired for the fighting camels and Ricky Clemens started off as a walk on and earned a scholarship last season and continues to impress with his play he grew up in rolleville North Carolina 18 miles away from North Carolina state so a bit of a homecoming for Ricky Clemens his camels are fighting here down by Music six after that made basket by Helms hes up to 15 wolf pack have made their last five basket get in a row and a charge called against Henderson Jun a push off Helms was there to get in front of it Helms getting it done on both ends offensively you talked about his numbers thats just great footwork and sliding of the feet did you know that Geicos whole 15 minutes thing the wolf pack playing well to start the second half jerich Cole Helms the Junior leading the way hes got a game high 15 and hes getting it done on the defensive end as well just drew the charge right before the break and hes been the one bright spot for NC State as you said getting it done on both ends and boy they needed all of his 15 points in this one lets see how they close it out I still say they need to attack the key dont settle for jumpers right inside Manny bit rocks the rim thats where their advantage is and beautiful execution offensively that time out of the double team extra pass unselfish MAA three thats off the mark the wolf pack have made their last six baskets looking for s it would have been but the rim got in the way of bites before he could slam it home thats a missed opportunity Bates is open three on two Daniels straight to the rack Devin Daniels and NC state has a 10point lead well this is danger zone right here for Campbell again NC state has sped this game up with their pressure and then have been able to get stops and get out into transition to get some easy buckets foul off the ball and is that going against Manny Bates wow if so thats his fourth again they yeah it looks like he called a hip he moved this and thats another big call against Manny Bates and something Kevin Keats talked about look we have to keep him out of foul trouble obviously we talked about the rim protection one of the best in the country but can ill afford to pick up those tyght files well you never want Manny Bates to pick up quick fouls like he has today but I think its even more important with DJ thunderberg the other big man unavailable today for the wolf pack he would normally be the guy to come in in at that Center position and instead wolf pack are left pretty bare at the big man spot yeah really uh Weve referenced this nine players as you take a look at Manny Bates his production on the bench so Kevin keeps limited with his options right now its the freshman sebron in there and hell head to the foul line a first trip to the F line for Darion sebron today freshman out of nori Virginia its a really talented freshman class that Kevin KS has brought in sebron is a freshman because of a red shirt but he joins cam hay Shaquille Moore Jaylen Gibson in a class that as as they continue develop shows that the the future is very bright here in righ Kevin Keats and staff have done an amazing job recruiting and then to go along with the Player Development we talked about Manny Bates the progress that he has made so again the numbers are there as well too for Kevin Keats both of these teams freshman heavy you see Campbell has eight freshman on Kevin mcans team Music Thomas Allen checks back into the game both pack on a seven nothing run over the last two minutes of change have made Seven of their last eight baskets as theyve really picked it up on the offensive end jich call the big reason why right on Q knocks down that jumper and hes up to 17 points on the afternoon beautiful out of bounds underneath execution Little Brush screen and he continues to shoot the ball well almost another turnover there for Campbell the defensive intensity is picked up for the wolf pack and the Run has followed a nine nothing run now largest lead of the game of 13 for the wolf pack and you said its a danger zone for Campbell this game starting to slip away from the camels Alam looks inside finds Shaquille for the easy layup well the pressure really starting to impact uh Campbell and what theyre doing the offensive execution in the second half has not been there like it was uh in the first first see State really forcing their will on them in the second half the wolf pack have shot it nine of 11 another turnover but a charge called Shaquille Moore couldnt cash in on that takeaway well you like the aggression by The Freshman this one right here though a pull it out if you dont have anything again youre trying to make a Euro Step not enough room to do that again you forced the turnover and in that case you want to keep possession you have a 15point lead last thing you want to do is give the ball right back to Campbell this was a twopoint game at Halftime and now NC States open it up to 15 again nine of 11 shooting in the second half Campbell struggling particularly from three theyre two of 12 from Deep 4 seconds to shoot Whitfield drives the lane floaters an airball Daniels from the corner cant connect and a foul called so NC State really comfortable in this second half theyve opened up a 15point lead against Campbell most genes are made for average bodies but theres no such thing as an average person the Devin Daniels and Jericho Helens had rare off games Thursday night against St Louis and Malcolm both guys have bounced back brilliantly against Campbell this afternoon yeah Helens is definitely the guy in that game St Louis had six points two of nine from the floor really struggled a tonight uh really different story uh he has been key for NC State offensively he leads the way with 17 commits the foul there though interestingly that was a homecoming for Helms in St Louis grew up there in Missouri went to Shaman College Prep where he was third on the school scoring list behind uh two pretty good guys Jason Tatum and Bradley Beal so thats not bad company yeah now very talented player and you know again all these players now uh when we speak to all these coaches I think uh lack of consistency uh is going to be a theme early on in the season because of the lack of really really consistent playing time and practice time and and that really has been what NC State and Kevin ke and their coaching staff has been dealing with leading up uh to this season early on no doubt its plagued so many teams across the country but you take a look at what the wolf pack have had to deal with and I think they underscore it you know you dont play since December 3rd nearly two weeks off five games canceled and postponed in a 17day span and they you only have nine guys available on the road against a really good St Louis team only nine guys available again today less than 48 hours later and theyve somehow managed to make it work in large Parts he said hels having a huge day nine guys available and it almost feels like eight with Manny Bates being out with much of the first half with two fouls now hes on the bench with four fouls and yet NC State making it work especially as of late theyre on an 11 to1 run over the last 5 minutes and theyre going to be a team that when theyre back at full strength they are a very dangerous team a team that I think could make a lot of noise in the ACC and certainly if theyre in the NCAA tournament great effort inside Jericho Co H will not be Music denied what a bounceback game this has been for him he has been dominant and Jay the thing I like about it uh you can tell his offense really has spurred his defense uh he has been solid defensively for NC State Campbell cant hit anything right now two of 13 from three now they have let this game slip away it was a twopoint game at half time but Kevin kes crew is starting to open this up and run away with it in the second half I think the key word Relentless they have pursued Campbell with their defensive pressure relentlessly throughout this game and is now starting to wear of this team out its interesting Manny Bates went on the bench six minutes go with that fourth foul in that time Campbell has not made a single basket no field goals in the last 6 minutes and 10 seconds for the camels nice triple from Shaquille Mo The Freshman Nails his second to the afternoon Campbell went to a 32 Zone tried to change up and give NC State a different look defensively and that worked in the first half and been a different story in the second half offensively though for NC State Wolfpack shooting 73 in the second half 11 of 15 Campbell just looking for something another shot goes begging they are just one for their last 10 what a block out though by Braxton Beverly giving up a lot of size was still able to come up with the defensive board heres Beverly for three hes got itton Beverly getting it done on both ends and its all wolf pack in the second half Music nobody on the offensive glass for Campbell the camels are just one of their last 11 and St on a 19 to1 scoring run over the last seven minutes minutes and 30 seconds looking for more but off the fingertips of Applause zebron coming up after us we will send you to Central New Yorks Buffalo taking on Syracuse and then the Huddle at 8 to recap the ACC Championship Game on the grid iron and then UCF take it on number 15 Florida State at 900 all coming up right here on the ACC Network Manny baits back into the game with four fouls Campbell only has eight points make it 10 in this second half and that their first Basket in nearly 8 minutes 7 minutes and 48 seconds without a m field goal until that score well credit NC State and their pressure deep and it really has been the difference for their offense theyve created a lot of offense with excellent defense in the second half NC State Shaquille Moore and Thomas Allen might not show up in the Box Score but those two have been really excellent keeping the ball alive playing strong defense Allen there with a good hustle play to keep this possession going Music Bates playing with four fouls has to be careful kind of leans off and Henderson Jr can capitalize a heads up play by Henderson going right at Bates knowing that he had a foul trouble so and also heads up by baits not picking up another foul a 19 to one run during that sequence as NC State up comfortably at 18point lead at some point in their life 52 of all men will experience erectile dysfunction but most of them never get treated came up comfortably over Campbell 58 to 4 Malcolm hucke J alter with you you take a look at the last three seasons under Keats Malcolm and they have been squarely on that bubble they got in his first year Jess left off his second year some people thought it was a snub and then we talked to Joe lardy this week Malcolm you did and he said if there was a bracket he had NC State projected as the last four in a phenomenal job I mean weve talked about it what Kevin Keats was been able to do with this NC State program and how hes done it so fast three years in a row over 20 wins and last season I think its a shame because they were playing some good ball and obviously uh they had a matchup after their first win in the ACC tournament uh but again Kevin Keats has this thing going in the right direction and uh really a phenomenal job by him and his staff and he took over in difficult circumstances this was not kind of an easy project and yet to get into the tournament in that first year gave a lot of Wolfpack fans hope that they were trending in the right direction on fortunate to miss out barely in his second season and then we dont know what could have happened if they get into the tournament maybe make a run a year ago but this team returns a lot of those guys Devin Daniels Braxton Beverly Manny Bates DJ thunderberg yeah a lot of people would think that they get into the tournament this year and yet you talked to Joel lardy and he says no theyll probably be right around the bubble again like theyve been the last three years well I think this year its so early again uh what Joe uh I think like any person doing rackology this year there is so many uh things that are going to be going on teams playing without key players obviously games uh Miss because of cancellation so uh this year Joe used the oldfashioned were going to use a lot of common sense uh and its going to be a very difficult task for them not that its ever easy any year but I think this year more than ever with Co cancellations players out uh good luck to him and his crew trying to figure that one out the good news for ACC teams like NC State is you have the opportunity to gain some quality wins because we just showed you the schedule pretty much every opponent is a quality game well I think ever more so this year every game counts uh because your opportunities could be less again because of cancellations or um you know youre dealing with a situation where youre without key pieces you look at NC State today as we take a look at a beautiful duck in by Manny Bates they have nine players I mean Kevin ke has really no uh not many options to go to on his bench so uh this year uh really is just going to be one of those years where its I think going to change almost daily and now all nine available players have played in the game is Nick Ferrar as checked in number 30 in in white and red made his first career basket while we were talking about what Joe lonardi had to say about the wolf pack Manny bits at the line really a phenomenal story in terms of Player Development and also just a transformation last year guy averaged Five Points a game this year here hes up at double digits and uh we talked about the blocks one of the best if not the best rim protector in college basketball right now earlier in the game became the fastest ACC player to 100 career blocks in more than 20 years the only two guys in the ACC to do it faster Georgia Tech Alvin Jones and then Tim Duncan before that wow one one guys one and even though its a 20point game Malcolm this is good game experience for bats the last few minutes and for the final five minutes to get experience playing with four fouls yeah youre absolutely right he needs to learn how to play without fouls I think you go to the other side for Campbell again this is another opportunity for you to get ready as you hopefully get into Big South Conference play and again they had some positives early on in this game where they were able to run their offense get some high percentage shots I think the key for them though is going to be taking care of the ball when they play against pressure many baits in perfect position for a big finish at The Rim hes a vacuum cleaner inside 10 points five rebounds for Bates whos played much of this game in foul trouble one of the things that we have not talked about a lot in this game Jay is the lack of crowd or crowd noise again NC State one of the better venues great fan base um these players have to adjust to this but one thing the folks watching at home uh pay attention to the communication you can hear uh the NC State and also Campbell players communicating on defense and you know if theres young players out there watching this again good defensive teams you will hear them communicating uh talking to each other talking about whos switching uh helps side defense and so for so thats I think one of the advantages now without having the crowds in there you can hear these guys communicating on defense thats a great Point Malcolm and you know obviously we all wish the fans were able to be in PNC Arena screaming their heads off first game of the season in PNC Arena but you try and look for the positives and thats certainly one sometimes even as broadcasters I like to lay out and listen to see what we can can here cuz Ill agree with the NC State one of the more active teams especially defensively on this possession right here if Campbell gets it across half court listen to the NC players talk on ball screens Music and you certainly can hear the coaches yelling out instructions as well too so just a different thing to look for when youre watching these games now unfortunately with empty Arenas you can hear all the communication that goes on in games take a look at the stat sheet in Campbell where this game may have slipped away from them you go on the road you playing ACC team they only shot two of 16 from three and thats just not good enough for Kevin mcans group now and again early on they were getting quality looks I think where it turned in the second half of the NC State Defense really sped them up and then they forced them into some really difficult twos and threes and thats why that percentage really got stuck below 20 Music here Manny Bates communicating on that screen letting his point guard know theres a screen coming and then get back a rebound timeout taken by Kevin Keats his team team up comfortably 6544 Manny bits doing it on both ends weve seen the blocks and then an easy finish wolf pack up Music in to the Huddle as the guys break down all the ACC teams playing in a bowl game and look ahead to the college football playoff semifinals theyll tell you everything you need to know selection special Sunday 800 eastern time tomorrow night on the ACC Network the big debate is does Clemson and Notre Dame both get in right now Im hearing over on ABC Clemson taking it to Notre Dame so you wonder okay that probably puts the Tigers in actually that definitely puts the Tigers in but if they beat him too bad does the committee decide to not put in Notre Dame that is the big question yeah very interesting and obviously Clemson losing a game without their star player obviously Im glad that they still dont get penalized for that but thats going to be a very interesting decision if Clemson does wind up winning in a blowout fashion and obviously its much harder in college football you can only take four teams compared to college basketball with 68 but I think the parallel can be drawn is well if a team on the bubble loses a game without their best player like Trevor Lawrence and Clemson did how can the committee penalize them when theyre going to be in full strength for the playoff for and I think in basketball youll see the same debate kind of take play same conversation I have with Joe lonardi as you try to size up these teams as we hopefully get close to March Madness uh take for example an NC State team playing without uh arguably one of their better players uh DJ funbank is a guy that flirted with playing in the NBA hes not out on the court right now for Kevin Keats hes got nine players they lose to a St Louis team uh certainly again you dont want to take anything away from what St Louis did but uh certainly theyre not at 100 a team that barely practice and then is without some key pieces and Kevin Keats knows all too well about life on the bubble NC state has been on that bubble pretty much since hes taken over here with the wolf pack but its impressive that you know three straight season 20 or more wins to start his tenure at NC State in all three years especially because you know he was telling us yesterday he he takes the job and then five months later you know NC States kind of put under a cloud with the FBI announcing they part of their recruiting violations that theyre looking into that happened well before keatss time here and yet he he doesnt use it as an excuse he just wants to persevere power on and win basketball games here in Raleigh well I think thats why its even more impressive I think it starts with recruiting again hes recruited the state well he bought some guys back uh to the state uh and I think the Player Development piece again you have to have those uh two things its key you have to obviously recruit Talent players but then you have to develop them when they get here and you look at what hes done uh with a guy like Manny Bates obviously the defensive uh intensity is there obviously the blocks are there but how he has improved offensively uh each year I think thats something that again is whats going to get them over the top and into the NCAA tournament am Manny Bates a North Carolina native Jaylen Gibson cam hay Shaquille Moore all North Carol natives those are guys that Keats has recruited in hes even brought some local guys back Thomas Allen a Juni who committed to Nebraska played two years there hes from Raleigh originally and Kevin Keats made a point to bring him back to continue to grow the Homegrown roster it was funny we were talking with Kevin Keats about Allen yesterday and he said even though he technically is the transfer the new guy because hes from Raleigh hes the goto food guy for local flavor here in Raleigh so we asked him to put together his his top three places he would go in Raleigh and and now hes just making me hungry when you take a look at that some soul Seafood Cafe action Lees Kitchen which is a Jamaican Cuisine spot and then a Japanese Steakhouse to round out the top three well top of my list next time were back down there I got to check out the Soul Food Cafe uh the food truck again thats going to be top list for us right there mark that down and certainly uh this was a much needed uh win for the NC State team bounce back from that St Louis loss and certainly it all started in the second half for them with the defensive intensity picking up Ed SE State started the second half hitting nine of their first 11 shots bounced out to a 19 to1 run and they have looked comfortable since then this game was a twopoint game at Halftime Campbell actually LED for most of that first half but once NC State turned it on it the wolf pack have looked really comfortable I think some positives if youre Campbell again that first half of their execution really uh was really nice in terms of in the half court when they werent turning it over they got high quality shots everybody was involved and the offense I think the one area again theyre going to have to continue to work on as they get closer to conference play turnovers in particular against the full court pressure of NC State that really changed the dynamic of this game Music Music dish inside to fur to cap it off Music Music we saw a lot of that in the first half for Campbell think a little bit too much pressure in the second half and if youre Kevin geats and NC State you have to be pleased with how your team bounce back after the St Louis loss and then in the second half they got back to playing NC State basketball pressure ball and then getting out in transition a really a good performance in the second half
