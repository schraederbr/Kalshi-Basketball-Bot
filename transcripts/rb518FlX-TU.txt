since 2000 thats hard to believe it is when youre talking about Rivals 25 years to be able to play in this tournament and not have met is asking a lot but nothing more could be at stake for both these teams playing here in this quarterfinal round so underway in our second game of the day North Carolina team that has been reigning threo makes in the last several games and Allen Luben in Clos cant hit and I love hearing Steve Forbes talk about we got to get the ball inside epon Reed who had a double double on his senior night now with an opportunity to be the focal point of the offense on the interior four Wake Forest lets see how they try to get the ball inside salz feeding to Big Man to sevenfooter Fon Reed draws the double hild with the pass off to Johnson and a miss and typically W for as their guards go as Salis and hildor go thats how they go that is absolutely how they go theyve gotten production out of eon read on the interior as of late but its normally going to be those two guys that have to get the job done in the scoring column big pile kind of allowed to do what he wanted to do there and he banks it in The Talented freshman with the bucket but such a size Advantage for Drake pal over Cameron Hilder for about 3 to four inches with pal being able to attack the bass can see over top of Defense Salis feeding inside nice quick strike there from Gra V Spillers to 67 Jr look at the North Carolina starting lineup K O Davis pal Withers who was Sensational yesterday and Luben who is outstanding too North Carolina in their last five games has made 57 threes hes going to be on the line a turnover by Withers those 57 triples are the most in a five game Span in North Carolina history and so when you considered a threepointer came into play in the 1986 87 season lets think about all the different great North Carolina teams from then lets go back 2005 National Champion 2009 National Champion 2017 National Champion with Justin Jackson leading the way but all the threes that those teams make to see that this group as through a fivegame stretch has been even better than all of those teams ild in heavy traffic got the pass away and another one by Spillers as four fast points Obie early in the season we saw Spillers as they focal point offensively for Wake fors if they can get back to that and get that production out of him that helps his team be successful withs decides not to shoot the three the two instead and Reed with the rebound and they want to push the tempo Salis tonight K got in there is Johnson straight on that clangs away thats the second bad Miss Tyler Johnson has had from three Cameron H actually hesitated on the first one to throw it to him at the top of the key and after two misses like that he may not get a third good with the ball he had 10 assists in their win against Notre Dame hell leave that one short North Carolina really moved the ball brilliantly against the Fighting Irish all through that Victory out to Powell on the Run trying to go in strong and thats going to be an offensive and that is Cameron hilders game thats what he does take charges put lay his body on the line This is a young man who is played in so many different roles throughout his career at Wake Forest one of the Rarities of guys that have spent all four years at one school and now playing to try to keep his season alive out of Worthing England at 64 he can heat up fast too Reed with a touch banging with Ben Allen Luben pass on the Baseline the scoop shot wont fall for John right now hes off to a frustrating start he really is and you consider opportunities right at the rim and this is what we were expect to see withs do to start out the game hes turned down two threes and unable to knock down the first yesterday he hit s threes thats a Carolina record in the ACC tournament and now RJ Davis named second Team all ACC a collision there and a foul on the play with 1616 to go and thats an offensive but you see the Improvement defensively by the Demon Deacons Hunter Salis Cameron h both guys their leaders looking to play their body on the line take the charge maintain possession for their team well for give get back possession for their team by doing the job defensively and thats really where theyve been AI team this year weve seen Steve Forbes teams be great offens groups but they struggled to defend this years team has been the absolute opposite moov that quickly into the corner and the bucket drained by Juke Harris freshman only makes 30 from three and this is a lineup that Steve fors has used a lot especially if Tyler Johnson is struggling you bring in Juke Harris and you move Cameron Hilder to the point guard position and allow him to be the playmaker and Harris to be a finisher good old the bounce feed Luben with a Miss in close Salis in the offensive zone averaging 18 points a game also wakes assist leader hildr from the foul line got a great look and look at the smile looking over at Hunter Silas both of them showing huge Smiles they love the way theyve approach it normally its the team that has played prior that has all the energy at first but its been the Demon Deacons here to start tonight the kicks it out for po hell fire it up there in and out Obie that shot was an afterthought that was okay I dont have anything else to do so Ill just shoot it Drake pow is a better player than that has to be aggressive with his decisions move the basketball or shoot it once he catches it North Carolina just one for seven out of the gate hild withth again Spillers on the Baseline what was a tough shot but he made it this is the best start Steve Forbes could have imagined look at coach forb hes meeting his team at half court OB hes excited about the opportunity toet Cooper flag unable to return in the game of course but one way and that is tough we also understand that coach corbes loves a good acronym he told me his acronym coming into this one is mte mental toughness extra effort cor you mentioned it earlier their success this season has come on the defensive end he said we have to get back to who we are and thats the defense that we need to see the emphasis is there even though it was the last play on re for the foul absolutely Angel and when you consider that this has been the area of concern for the Demon Deacons really for the first four years of Steve Forbes tenure and Wake Forest the way that they made the change this year with the offensive Firepower that they had coming back with Salas a first team all ACC performer for two straight years epton Reed and C Cameron Huff they felt like they wouldnt have to worry about what they did offensively but thats been the struggle OB Hunter Sal only shot 20 8 from three this year and thats been a struggle for him theyve had a hard time shooting but the defense has been relatively consistent for them each and every time out Salis in fact has attempted about twice as many threes as any other of the Demon Deacons a 28 glaring there many who felt that maybe second team for him not first team all ACC I was shocked to see him make on the first team all ACC because when you consider that both he and RJ Davis are returning First Team all ACC forers RJ Davis numbers very well could have been better than Hunter silass this year especially from a shooting percentage standpoint North Carolina seeking their 19th ACC tournament Championship their first since 2016 Jackson to lift it rebound comes right back to him on the tip Davis Music Trimble a shot clock inside 10 and a turnover and that was a great trap thats the one place you want to stay away from they call it coughin corner and both the Cameron hild and epon re recognizing sep Trum will in that corner trap him with the sideline and the Baseline around him four turnovers already for North Carolina they had two in the first half yesterday heres Salis a long one coming got that one that rattles home for three and Hunter Salas not concerned about what the numbers were in the regular season is postseason time now stepping up and hoping to be playing his best basketball but I love the fact that hes taken on the challenge of Defending RJ Davis to start this game as well F off the fake the spin nothing there and stolen away by Harris nice job by duuke Harris helping in off to the backside taking the basketball away and now five turnovers early for the tar Hills you just mentioned how well they handled the basketball yesterday but not getting enough opportunities at The Rim throughout this one El took a little shove there by the Freshman Jackson for the personal who first Hunter Salis excited this the second time weve seen him showing his pearly whites throughout this one he was smiling when he saw Cameron hilders knock down the bucket then after seeing himself knocked down to three ball excited about this opportunity and again youre talking about some guys looking at the finale of their career this could be the end if they dont win this game today off the side of the backboard by Frederickson On The Run heres Davis hildra got back beautifully and a great job by hildra staying vertical RJ actually lost that basketball on the way up El got a great look but an air ball well thats rare Cameron hild with that much time shooting an air ball he actually shot the basketball better from three this year than weve seen from him in the past yeah 20 points in a win against Carolina in January whos a major factor there Davis finding Trimble hes open he cant cash in but a whistle on the play inside Al is fouling Trimble on the three will be his first foul at 1203 to go here in the first half and a strong first half for Wake Forest but you dont want to bail out Carolina theyre struggling to score of course you consider theyve already played almost eight minutes only three points you dont want to bail them out and give a guy like Seth tremble that confidence at the free throw line for three shots good foul shooter very solid Music 82 hes a guy who can be a major contributor offensively at 27 against Dayton 18 against Boston College 17 against Florida State without RJ Davis in the exhibition game against Memphis OB had 33 and hes the guy thats LED North Carolina in rebounding during the regular season so plays much bigger than his 63 statute only you would remember what a guy scored in an exhibition game its my guy you know I mean not everybody but I remember with Seth Seth is my guy hes one of my favorites so not saying he not impressive but the fact that you remember it is a little frightening to me you still recall that from all those months ago does seemed like a long time ago right October yes weve seen you and I a lot of great basketball this season and well continue to see plenty more I think here in this ACC tournament that was really a dog fight today between between Duke and Georgia Tech so much happened in that game they really did and give Georgia Tech a tremendous amount of credit for the way they approached the game got off to a great start Harris on the attack hes denied I like the fact that jayen with Gib me jayen Washington went vertical armed that one and stopping the opportunity love the no call even more so open Shooters Jackson way too open for him at 41 but just like that a 60 run after the three free throws Ian Jackson knocks down the three just like that its a fivepoint game Jackson Nam to the ACC all freshman team hit 19 double figure scoring games he can really get hot heres Harris outside directing traffic shot clock to nine Salis Tribble chasing him off the screen shot clock is winding down and expires Hubert Davis really fired up after to that defensive effort oh yes youber Lov that defensive effort seeing his team get a shot clock violation and is a player but one thing was certain each and every time out Huber will absolutely bring the energy on the sideline well they beat Notre Dame Yesterday by 20 and hit 13 threes in that one and alen Luben slicing inside will draw the foul he had a good one yesterday 17 and 10 against the Fighting Irish yeah double double against his former team started his career with the Fighting Irish so of course thats a game you have to win been Allen luin played with that sense of urgency yesterday hild withth his first foul hes a 67 foul shooter the other thing he did yesterday that was very impressive he did not turn the ball over one time well Carolina handled the basketball extremely well yesterday and especially when you consider their two guards RJ Davis and Elliot Kad dishing out I believe 16 combined assists to only three turnover so thats more of the type of performance that Hubert Davis will be looking to see from his group today but not off to that similar start well hes got the rebound it almost went for him Carolina a little seven nothing run to draw to it in Music four Salis trying to use that screen by Reed who rolls off it shot clock to seven theyve already had one violation Spillers down to two he gave it up res got to heave it up there rebound tipped and itll be Carolina ball Applause Music Applause Davis from the logo off to Jackson who can shoot it from there coming up on the 10minute Mark of the first half in Charlotte Davis with the kick Withers around and out not quite having the same first first half as he had yesterday when he just couldnt miss we had that comment yeah we talked about it yesterday you want to save some and again North Carolina knocking down those 13 threes Jaylen wether seven of those 13 but you want to save a couple of those knowing that youre going to have to play again dribble off the inbounds little too strong tapped out and it will stay right here be Carolina ball to that point youre a terrific player in your ACC games and your career did you ever think to yourself well you were filling it up scoring 251 he I need to save a couple of these never never never you want as many as you can get if I if I was filling it up one day I was thinking that oh I can get even more tomorrow and Im sure thats the same thing Jaylen Withers was thinking coming into this game get greedy right yeah absolutely you have to be in this game Withers got it he sticks the triples so now hes starting to get back and thats the toughest shot hes had to take throughout this game thus far have to put it on the floor the cross over the pull back but showing off that hes more than just a catch and shoot guy has the ability to make plays off the B Carolina defense has really stiffened trying to force another turnover here W for is scoreless in over four minutes now Reed went for the pass deflect it out Jackson did a great job to get in there and prevent an easy basket and Kad back on look at Hubert over here look at the energy out of the head coach well he thought he got a turnover there but he wants his guys to get on the floor after the basketball yubert Davis and is a very mild mannered person that thats the thing his coaching personality is completely different from his actual personality off the floor but he is intense on the sideline did you have coaches who were like that guys uh no most of my coaches for the most part were pretty even kill except for my youth coach John Spears who was never even killed ild look at for a great save as he went tumbling out onto the Baseline and kept it alive tremendous effort now W trying to turn that into points thats been tough the last four or five minutes Reed boy he got an excellent opportunity there and he can make those we saw him knocked down a couple of Threes at Duke but thats a shot that Huber Davis will live with if he can keep Hunter and Cameron H out the painted area tar Hills trying to grab the lead pass inside Luben no couldnt convert it lot of contact no whistle heres Applause Salis Reed finding hildr big Drive no rebound knocked around great effort by epon Reed hild open from the corner look fall look at Reed but thats thats that finality OB e Reed is playing as though this could be his last game weve seen him get on the floor weve see him leading talking to Cameron hildr letting him know see whats going on theyre trying to feed the basketball inside but as North Carolina overplays him the opposite side is open I love the way that he has approached this game to start recognizing that this could be his last opportunity to wear this uniform well you see a different look in the eyes of Hunter Salis Cameron hild and Fon Reed all three of those guys turned over for Salis he has Frederickson running with him the scoop no the follow yes by Salis Hunter Salis not conceding that it will be a layup made by Frederickson does a great job following up the play and picking up Second Chance points breaks the drought for Wake Forest Ben Allen Luben spinning the opposite way for two pretty basket very nice by Luben and when you had you have to play similar to that when youre going up against a taller Defender Ben all Lum at 68 after read at 7 ft has the advantage but Ben allum able to go a round read leak by a one and a whistle at 718 to go here in the first half of our second quarterfinal of the day in Charlotte and turning into leaving they can win and now an opportunity for them to go up against up in the Big 12 tournament coming up next as mentioned lardy Jo is our bracketologist he is not the selection committee but he has North Carolina in right now Wake Forest out of the NCAA Applause tournament Kad will set it up now for North Carolina last time they had the lead it was two to nothing over the top Luben strong went again once again denied by Reed great job by Reed defensively right there denying multiple opportunities one by just using his length and second coming up with the block shot salz tough move heavy traffic gets it to go thats a determined bucket OB Hunter Sal was not going to be denied how about Tyler Johnson getting up tying up the basketball just on it underneath forgive me an outlet pass trying to get the ball in to Elliot Kad not recognizing that Tyler Johnson is there gets his hands on the basketball those are the scrappy play Steve Forbes wants to see made by Tyler Johnson Carolina their fourth Applause turnover Johnson on kadoo Salis again Reeds got it finds Spillers shot clock down to two well short by Reed but theyll get another chance North Carolina is fortunate right now OB theyve turned the basketball over nine times and theyre giving up offensive rebounds theyre fortunate to only be down three Salis a tough time all season shooting the three Music 28 pretty even on the offensive glass at the 6 Minute Mark but when you look at the field goal attempts Wake Forest has nine more shots than does North Carolina right now 27 to 18 P trying to fade away that was an almost impossible shot Break forc by Three and the ball Salis off the fake and gets the foul on pow thats a vet move thats a senior vers of freshman right there Drake Powell picking up his second foul off of a smart play by Hunter Salis and weve seen some moments early in this game thats a determined bucket by Hunter sales cradling the basketball keeping it away from Defenders until he gets in the open area and giving him an opportunity to get the bucket solid foul shooter 80 a senior from Omaha Nebraska and drills number one the winner this one to take on the Duke Blue Devils the top seed on Friday night game one in the semifinals at seven well have that for you of course in ESPN as pow goes to the bench and Salis with another one coming Applause and makes that to make it a fivepoint game meanwhile RJ Davis without a point for North Carolina came in averaging 17 but look whos been taking the challenge of guarding has been Hunter Salis and you put size on him Salis at 6566 is a strong presence to have to go up against him but Eon Reed stepping out trapping they paid special attention to RJ not letting him get going today five to shoot it tremble well short Obie you have to clip that one if youre Steve Forbes you take that defensive possession and you show it to your team over and over again showing what youre capable of on the defensive end of the floor poked away out of Play Wake Forest will retain possession just under 5 minutes to go in the half look at this OB watch Hunter Sal get after it when RJ Davis gets the basketball back then its Hunter salz and Eon Reed both traffic getting the ball out of his hands but hes not done there use the screen again were going to trap you again take him away from it not allowing RJ to get going on the offensive in the floor tough first half for a man who scored over 2600 points thats a good move in close by The Freshman Harris for a bucket and Duke Harris has given them productive minutes all season long Off the Bench North Carolina only 15 points to this juncture of the game mainly because this man with the ball has been shut out no longer draining a long triple and Steve Forbes and when you when you make a shot like that you just tip your cap to the other guy and say hey great shot because if RJ Davis has to beat you making great individual plays like that Steve fors will take his chances 21 against them back in January johns with a kick Hill with is open boy in and out you shoot it like that you think you made it oh you in your mind you tell yourself that you made it you dont even get discouraged about that good old Banks it in didnt call it but hell take it hey were in the banking Capital right now were in Charlotte this is where banking is at its most when youre talking about domestically so again the bank has to be open were still daylight outside not even a hint of a grin though by La K on that one 340 to go lost his dribble did Salis back off for Johnson eight to shoot Johnson trying to make a move 331 to go and Fon Reed with number two shunner Salis can do it Obie we talked about North Carolina yesterday and they had six different players with an assist early today nine turnovers seven players have committed a turnover so its been a struggle handling the basketball look Washington got hammered as he went rolling to the 10 kind of grabbing at the knees twopoint lead for WG Forest at 320 left but an odd Play Because Washington never jumps thats a lob and often times you you hang your point guard out to drrive with that one again this is dangerous because Washington never leaves the floor if he leaves the floor hes shooting free throws to start with that he catches the basketball and has an opportunity at the at the rim hild through the second foul on that play heres Trimble Davis had it slapped away and draws the foul on Harris and thatll be number one on the Freshman from Salsbury North Carolina so if you zoom in that is a our great producer Bill Paladino right there but if you zoom in on his on his uh credential you will see that he is wearing a credential that does not bear his name it Bears the name of my evil twin his name is Cory with an E Alexander well how did that happen Im Im not sure how that happened theres another one of you out there well I I know only not as nice I know that our great Lexi link took away my credential that was spelled my name wrong and so Billy P may have talked her into getting that credential were going to leave that under our hat we wont discuss it on the national broadcast under three and a turnover fimble with a save and kadot Diving down to keep it alive terrific effort by the tar Hills Kad on the attack will lay it in and thats the Elliot kdo that the tar Hills have been waiting for in this Applause game as he attacks in transition and it happened today and looking at tomorrow nights semifinal no foul on the last play so Kido with the basket 2422 Salis jumping inside and a Applause whistle two and a half left and that personal goes against Koo is second and Ian Jackson back on the floor for kadon now for Hubert Davis Johnson puts it Applause in coming up in the last two minutes of this first half quarterfinal and Johnson pressing the issue will draw another foul RJ Davis picks up number two and thatll put Johnson at the line good foul shooter the Louisville Transfer as he makes Music 83 wake for started playing better when Tyler Johnson got into the starting lineup they started part of the Season playing Hunter Salis at the point guard position but after struggling in the nonconference with Salis at the one it took away truly from what he does best which is score Steve Forbes made the move to send Tyler Johnson to the point guard position and they really picked up their production Tyler Johnson playing much better in his second SS in this game struggled early but now starting to help his team just 242 24 low scoring first half who does that help well it heway course because this is what they do defensively they can stifle you way down and RJ connects but the change in defense the 131 Zone theres always going to be an opening and the last guy you want to leave in that opening for Carolina is four in that Carolina blue itve been silenced for most of the first half but coming to life here at the tail end Salis real active rolls it in nice touch and nice job getting to the midrange by Hunter Sal but not over penetrating and picking up the Char Washington faks off to Jackson 90 seconds before the break in Charlotte Washington looking to set a screen Jacksons the open man the rebound comes right to Washington right his lap and a great job by J Jay was to continue to fight and not allow w Force to put a body on him and keep him away from an offensive rebound a weak really got off to a hot start but Carolinas come on strong here and another basket here to cut into the lead Wake Forest LED 143 in the early stanza and back came the tar Hills Steve Forbes going back to the manto man defensively and theyve got a Force protect right now e Reed on the bench with two fouls and now Trayvon Spillers picks up his first foul trying to hedge RJ Davis will send him to the line for one and one talk about a man right in the thick of it on every possession now huberts talked to us about his team and he said i got kind of a quiet team they dont talk a lot theyre not really really effusive even guys like RJ Davis have been around forever its not their style so hes had to be far more that way as a head coach and and you seen that hes absolutely done that whatever he needs to do for his team hes going to do it but the good thing about Hubert Davis in his first half he has his defense in front of the question is how far does he go outside of his coaching box in the second half to try to defend on the other end of the floor for the Tar Hill how far will he wander 479 Davis at the line a great foul shooter 863 his career that is alltime number one at Carolina 3128 RJ Davis playing with those two fouls shuber Davis getting him out of the lineup and it looks like the tar Hills are going to play Zone on this could be last possession Johnson hands it off in traffic the shot is up and good with a foul as well Omaha Baloo finishing through contact under the basket Bela transfer from Iowa State a McDonalds allam two seasons ago and now making the move was injured the majority of this season but stepping in with Fon Reed in foul trouble an opportunity to tie the game at the free throw line Huber Davis going to get RJ Davis back in on an offensive substitution Washington picks up the person and Belo looking to make this threepoint play 38 seconds to go does exactly that that is the fourth time the games been Applause Music Applause tied so about 7c difference between the game and shot clock which is now down to 15 Jackson Jackson Off The dribble does not need a lot of room to get up a shot on the drive rebound tipped up and in Washington there a great play by Ian Jackson not settling for the jump shot but getting downhill salz on a Blow by no a battle for the rebound and thats how the first half comes to an end North Carolina and in that one Carolina Leed 3129 at half wakelin on a 10 nothing run to win the game by a single point Lu gets him going but it was great recognition by benal L because if he continues his momentum to the basket Cameron hild is there to take the charge Lin does a great job recognizing where he is in space in the soft touch to finish it off hes been superb on the glass too Duke to take on the winner in a semifinal round here in Charlotte at 700 tomorrow well see if theres any chance CER flag is going to play kdo on the run and Banks it in and thats when Elliot kdo is at his best and he saw just one white jersey back he was going to absolutely attack Hunter salz and made sure he had to defend him at The Rim oh by the way the championship game coming up on Saturday at 830 the great dick by to will be joining un and I court side what a treat for us and for the two teams to have opportunity to compete in the ACC tournament Championship to get Dicky V back on board tight D Reed with a misfire and a whistle at 1843 to go lets check him with Angel guys I was able to co uh catch up with Coach Forbes and he addressed both sides of the floor starting on the defensive end he said we have to box out wasnt pleased that they were outrebounded 24 17 but the 7 to2 Second Chance opportunities is what he wanted to address on the offensive side he said we are well he addressed the two shot clock violations he said were holding the ball the attct mentality has to be better in the second foul moments to go on Tyler Johnson Turn Around by Kad using the window really effectively today and Kad is a better player when hes attacking the rim looking to score hes a natural passer but those will open up for him once teams take him seriously when hes going to the rim looking to get a bucket El jumping in the paint draws the foul could not connect but he does take a hit North Carolina looking to pick up their 22nd win remember they won six in a row before they lost to the Duke Blue Devils bounced back and defeated Notre Dame by 20 yesterday in their first game in the ACC tournament and Obi to Echo your point on how well North Carolina have played offensively going into that game against Duke they were averaging 91 points per game in a six game winning streak after they lost to Clemson you saw a change in lineup from Hubert Davis and he put a biger lineup on the floor that included Drake pal jayen Withers and when you consider Ben Allen Luben going into that starting five spot this lineup has been good for North Carolina when you consider RJ Davis as well as Elliot Kad remaining in the back court its helped them on the glass part of the reason why Steve forbs was upset about that rebounding Advantage theyve also been hitting their threes in a big way lets see palan a Miss fire there 3932 Carolina long run out Spillers got underneath and hes on the line the most common turnover in the game theres not a lot of space in that corner and if you Retreat step meaning that if your foot goes behind you youre automatically going to be out of bounds you have to side step out of that corner to be able to attack the Applause Bas RJ Davis the grab over 170 games at North Carolina fills up another one from threepoint L and that will trigger a time out for Wake Forest drop coverage against RJ Davis is dangerous we saw Wake Forest do it last SE RJ Davis Demon Deacons better figure that out they absolutely do and theyve got to figure out how theyre going to cover him in screen and roll action we saw him do a great job early in the first half RJ has figured out now theyre trying to guard Del is pounding it and dropping in a line drive bucket thats also a way to attack a good score you go at him and force him to have to defend Hunter Salis getting some get back both our stars with 13 points here so far Salas averaging 18 Davis 17 kogo in crosscourt got an open shooter and twoo strong once again by Withers Applause nice job by kadoo getting a hand in there on a little Chase action stopping Salis from getting down hill elwi gave up the dribble and back out for Music Salis commanding the ball again hell shoot it nice job there by Drake PAL boxing out Spillers keeping him on his back not allowing him to come away with Second Chance opportunity Davis will feed F do and on the opposite side of the iron Luben wants that paint again on the back down on Reed who stayed home great job by Reed after allowing Ben Allen Luen to get that offensive rebound standing his ground defensively Salis again great determination he was not going to be denied weve seen that for Hunter Sal a number of times in this this game when he makes his mind up hes going to the rim theres nothing you can do about it its simply about whether or not he makes or misses the shot this time he makes it and hell get a free throw for his reward of his aggressiveness second foul on Ben Allen Luben to put Salis at the line an 80 foul Applause shooter 4236 North Carolina Big Forest the four seed North Carolina the five seed RJ Davis being chased here by Reed but you see the difference in effort by Reed on that screen roll action OB hes up trying to force him to go backwards good with a travel back over to wake it goes North Carolina unable to get much separation here despite a quick start in the second half they lead 42 and hes surrounded by royalty there but also guys with a lot of GM experience when you start thinking about Mitch Cup who was been the general manager of the Los Angeles Lakers as well as the Charlotte Hornets Buzz Peterson also heres Davis yeah another triple moments after Salis had another Savvy make and RJ is a perfect four of four from Beyond The Arc in this game hes got great looks Im sure Steve for not happy about RJ getting so much space Opera Spillers downstairs didnt get it tremble out of the pack hes got Jackson running with him Jackson has it denied as weight collapsed on him great job by Spillers to get to the other end of the floor fast 4538 North Carolina ball Music here Davis trying to stick with him theyre D Washington moving into the screen the dribble hand off and often times its another turnover we see off OB at the dho trying to get a body on the defender knocking them out knocking them down and out of bounds normally going to end up as offensive foul and Washington picks up his second Music Applause Trimble harassing Salis off for hild H can get rolling theyll pull up and stick it I think thats what we need to do for the remainder of the game is you talk about someone being quiet and the can get rolling they normally make a shot after that we saw with RJ Davis now we see it with Cameron H with you I go lets watch Cory eat something there you go man can he eat speaking of food where is it I know it Jackson back out for Trimble get late in the day for us game number two of our quarterfinal Duke won game one despite an ankle injury to Cooper flag this fire here by Davis they did take the Xray the Xray was negative for Cooper flag the question is will he play in the semifinal John shy said after the game Im going to be have to be convinced by everybody in the locker room that he should play which means he will not play as I mentioned during that game he is done for the tournament most likely however Im sure Cooper will do everything uhoh Slam by Spillers 10 points for him great action between the bigs post to poost passing right there spil iss not waiting for the three in the corner cutting to the rim and gets the easy bucket rimble little push off there no whistle cant make the jumper and now wait with a chance to tie this Applause game North Carolina had a double figure lead not long ago Reed thought about it back off for Harris hildr trying to squeeze by Jackson and also by Washington he kept on moving his own Miss he follows that with a basket yep I believe we will credit the notorious d OB for that basket as well as Cameron Hilder is now gone backto back buckets for the demon deas to make it a onepoint game well weve seen it many times in his career makes a couple of shots or look up hes got 17 but look at the challenge hes taking on right now denying RJ Davis pushing Davis out to about 40 ft trying to get a bucket Davis passed him with a kick out Jackson open around and out now Wade can grab a lead on this possession there last time they LED it was 22 to Applause 21 Reed on the high post drops it for hrth and another one Cameron hrth is heating up its amazing that you just recently said he can get going and boy has he gotten going three consecutive buckets for Cameron Hill on the offensive end a nothing run tremble fakes hell drive it and contact Reed with a body wake by one 1137 to go this one back and forth here in Charlotte minds and North Carolina fans will they be dancing as well Joe Ben Allen L Drake Po and this North Carolina team but equally as important for the Demon Deacons and Hunter Salis without a win here today this could be the last game that he plays in college basketball two shots for Seth Trimble the Junior from Wisconsin and drops in number one talked to Seth after the game yesterday and Im still waiting on him for you know to go dunk on somebody we call it catch a body but you know thats I said Im still waiting he says you know didnt have my best game today theres always tomorrow so well see if that happens here in the remaining 1137 but hes on your clock oh yes yes hes always on the clock every time hes playing he he knows that Im over here talking about the fact that hes the most athletic guy on the floor but doesnt always play like it Carolina back on top of a point trying to negotiate down low and swatted Away by tremble but thats what he does defensively he is the best that North Carolina has to offer with that end the floor took some contact on that one though not getting the Applause call Salis went down to a knee HTH clears it up top for Music Salis Salis the senior hildr the senior Salis trying to pull his way inside and draws the foul on Luben you were d was upset taking off his glasses and his concern is how was that a foul but there was no foul on the other end when Steph Trimble was in attack mode when there was much more contact so two coming here for Salis out of Omaha Nebraska hes had a long and successful career trying to keep it going Beyond Today and and trying to make sure his team takes on Duke tomorrow you and I talked with with Hunter back in November before the Michigan game and he talked about everything was getting to the NCAA tournament thats why he was back in school yep he had to play an NCAA tournament and has been in the NCAA tournament with Gonzaga but was not really a part of the rotation with those first two teams and now trying to get there as the main man with the Demon Deacons tremble of penetration Airborne that wont drop but he draws the foul in fact he and Fon Reed the seven footer for wak with teammates together at Gonzaga and as Steve Forbes was recruiting Hunter Salis to bring him to Wake Forest Hunter got win that Fon Reed was also considering it so Hunter became another recruiter to get Fon to come be a teammate with him at Wake Forest and the two of them together have given Wake Forest a great lift in their t Talent pulled over the last two years J Caris his second foul lets go to Angel well as you mentioned the relationship with coach forbs and Hunter Salis that is the primary reason why Hunter Salis talks about why he loved or found the love of the game once again he said in his first stop he didnt believe in his potential he was really questioning how much he could give the game but after his conversation with Coach Forbes he said drawing the strength from within playing with the chip on his shoulder and understanding that he can get through anything this is why he believes in Him wholeheartedly the 5 years that hes been with him he said Im challenged every day to be a better man and Angel when you consider Hunter Salis was a McDonalds allamerican the fivestar Prospect coming out but did you talked about he lost that confidence he lost that belief in his game Steve Forbes has allowed him to realize that over the last two seasons with the Demon Deacons uhoh Pell really went flying and thats going to be an offensive that was with nine on a shot clock so now let me show you this we need to see this replay cuzz I can tell you Elliot kadoo is one of the craftiest players you have in the ACC he makes you make plays as such Kad will do things like grab you and force you to push him off but that time he did not that was all Salis Hunter Salis was the one who initiates that contact and that is the perfect call on that possession Al with a second foul Carolina by one and the ball theyve gone cold no made field goals in five minutes plus who been trying to change that Balo got in there with a hand and deflected it Applause away wake trying to get back on top as we go back and forth and a turnover kadoo back for Withers the dribble now lost it it comes free to Luben its stripped from him another a loose ball picked up by Carolina and another whistle as Withers gets hit a wild sequence here in Charlotte but I love the consistency that the officials are calling this game with theyre allowing it to be a physical game on both ends of the floor you see that theres contact on these plays however theyre not going to be the deciding factor theyre going to let these players figure it out on the floor and North Carolina with more effort and more energy on that possession gets jayen Withers at the free throw line Miller the second foul withs to shoot two at Applause 70 and Fon Reed back on the hardwood for Coach Forbes here and after re playing with three fouls now for the majority of his time at w for hes battled foul trouble done a pretty good job staying on the floor as much as he can throughout this one but has to be very careful the next 937 dont want to pick up that fourth foul and make you not aggressive on the defensive end Salis guarded by Trimble swing for Harris Harris got tied up in a whistle before the shot and he draws another foul and suddenly a lot of whistles here kads third foul by the way been an issue for a point guard for North Carolina foul difficulty early in the year he was getting those two fouls in the first half though so Im okay with Elliot kadoo having three right now and again the effort is what you look for and Elliot kadoo is absolutely giving that effort but Juke Harris attacking the basket strong on their last possession weve got you covered on selection Sunday once again starts at 600 Eastern with sports center and on from there at 800 the womens field of will be Music revealed and my guy the notorious do will be finding out where youre going for the first and second round of the womens NCAA tournament right very excited about that its a great event not the only one a lot of our crew is in the same boat as we await our assignments become such a major event well I will absolutely be tuned in watching thats the true March Madness right now of course the womens tournament has taken over the last few years glad that we have it on our family of networks to be able to Showcase all the talent is for sure more and more Talent every single year shot clock to seven balloon deep in the corner shot clock to three now two has to Fire and picked off the rebound by Withers RJ Davis you dont want to settle here he drives it no and no whistle it bounces out and itll go the other way North Carolina thought it was their ball I believe North Carolina has a reason to think it was their ball that basketball and Bill comington not going to get any assistance from Ron grer or Eric Lewis but it did look like that basketball went off of wake four over eight minutes to go you cant go to the monitor there 50 to 49 with Carolina and I think we might have offsetting technicals here well we got a double foul bill comington trying to get Hubert Davis back to the bench Steve Forbes both running up on Bill Covington right now both guys mixing it up and retaliating with each other as you see Cameron Hilder Elliot CAD getting locked up and I like the double foul call there went off of Wake Forest and they did not get reward the basketball we had a chance to look at the replay during our break and the tar Hills were correct it did go off of omop belos arm last it did but Wake Forest wound up with the ball in a game like this coming right down to the wire thats a big possession and for both these teams playing for their NCAA tournament F so Hunter Salis with it for the demon dingens Reed kicks it back out for blue shot clock of factor down to four now Im not sure they know Salis with a shot cant stick it big fight for the rebound and a whistle how about zuk Harris hes made a lot of effort plays to help his team in this game youre talking about a young man from the state of North Carolina so when youre from North Carolina at some point you want an offer from the tar Hills he doesnt get it he ends up at Wake Forest and now an opportunity to go up against them Trimble with the foul todays experts at work brought to you by principal well you want to talk about an expert this guy has been an expert scoring the basketball third all time in ACC history RJ Davis who has had a spectacular afternoon thus far in this one 16 points for him but hes the only player in double figures for the Tar Hill haris makes the pair wake back on top by a point Salis with 19 Davis with Applause 16 and another whistle to stop play Hubert Davis came running down the sideline 742 to go and theyre going to review Hubert Davis is asking for review Im not sure if there was something extracurricular that happened if so we were sh action is under review Ron Gro saying the previous action is under Applause review wake Force leading 5150 lets look to our left here you see Jaylen Withers Just trying to cut through oh does Juke harrris stick out the left foot he does sticks out the left foot to trip Jaylen Withers and as insignificant as that may seem I believe that is a flagrant one foul and the reason why it has to be because if you dont call a flagrant one right now it sets the precedent that it is allowed in the game that could very well he stuck his foot out or is just contact that raises his foot gain by doing that and often times players think that theyre going to get away J with the small things however those small plays can cost you go from having a onepoint lead to giving away possibly two points with Withers at the free throw line for two shots but you give North Carolina the basketball right back with opportunity for a four or fivepoint possession North Carolina needs a hot hand they one for their last 13 Music Applause Davis usually the guy Trimble wants to fire it up there he air mailed it and the official Lewis goes tumbling into the photogs well thats because Hunter salz took him down Hunter Salis does a great job coming up with the basketball it looks as though he threw off of jayen Withers Applause Music foot officials are going to get together on this call he touches the ground before thats a great call by Eric Lewis Salis comes down with the basketball out of bounds watch his feet oh hes still inbounds hes still inbounds that does go off of jayen Withers foot if they were under two they could go go back and review it but it ends up being a great play defensively and another whistle with 79 to go to go against Wake Forest and thats going to be a technical foul on Hubert Applause Davis well the technical foul Came From the Bench maybe its not Hubert Davis but I believe its a bench technical from North Carolina right now put Salis at the line what a wild last four or five minutes here but Obie isnt really this what we should expect from a four five matchup when youve got two teams fighting for their playoff lives is that my guy I believe thats my guy Brad Frederick who got up it was very emphatic on the sideline and allows forced to take the lead right back after the two free throws made by Withers on the flagrant foul and the ball back Salis Returns the Applause favor 5352 Reed hwith will line it up and a lot of iron but it rolls off you cant ask for a better offense if youre Steve fors great play by Salis to get it to Reed in a nice find of hild in the corner just able to get it to go under seven Davis on Salis oneonone and hell draw the foul as he takes the tumble but he gets up hobbling oh right back down again Davis some pain as he was attacking the basket as Defenders get in his path watch his left foot does he step on a defenders foot going in as Juke haris steps in trying to stunt on that play turns that left ankle going in you saw the reaction from RJ as soon as hes going to take the shot the old oldest trick in the book try to tie your shoe up tighter foul by the way and Drew Carris will be his fourth and Davis headed to the foul Applause line trying to walk it off here in our first game today we saw Cooper flag ACC Player of the Year Rookie of the Year going down with an ankle injury and did not return seems very doubtful that hell play again in the ACC tournament but we shall see Davis makes that one difference between the two though OB Cooper flag knows that he has the NCAA tournament to play in as you see Cooper flag earlier today Landing from Great Heights coming down on that left ankle turning the ankle but for RJ Davis if he doesnt continue to win this could be it its going to take more than that to take RJ Davis off this floor which could be the last time in the Carolina blue uniform well weve had 10 lead changes today in a lowc scoring Affair in the 50s Salis to penetrate sticks it I tell you what how about the battle that weve had from the seniors in this game you can see Hunter Salis Cameron HFF Ethan Reed for Wake Forest RJ Davis for North Carolina playing as though this could be their last possible game leaving everything on the floor SS to 23 Davis will pull a pop round it out and a whistle 611 remaining and well go the other way in a onepoint Affair foul on Luben as his fourth meanwhile Hunter Salis is saying I dont know what all this talk about I dont belong in the first team of the ACC the 23 points well he has absolutely shown up here as you see vid Allen Lu with two hands in the back of Cameron hild that going for that rebound talk about Hunter Salis half of his points half of Wake Forest points at 24 Hunter Salis accounted for 12 of them in this second Music half and both of these teams OB if they dont win the ACC tournament would be nit eligible however two seasons ago when North Carolina did not make fcaa tournament they denied their opportunity they did not want to go to the NIT Steve Forbes who spent time in the NIT the last two seasons does not want to see the NIT again they want to get to the NCAA tournament we dont know if they would even accept the bid if it happened readed making one wake by Applause Music two Jackson back for Davis Music trying to get Jackson open beond the threepoint line didnt happen there shot clock at nine Davis chased by Reed Powell Powell pulls up at the elbow no great job defensively by F Reed showing on that screen getting the basketball out of the hands of RJ Davis forcing someone else to have to take a shot man of the Tar Heels gone cold and missed 15 of 16 Music HTH at a hot spurt gets it off for Reed again he draws the double Salis gets a look at a shot clock down to three now Reeds got to get a shot in the air he cant hit it off the back of the iron Spillers did a great job keeping that one alive that was Trayvon Applause Spillers under five minutes to go in Charlotte this quarterfinal Cameron hildr on the drive another second of a shot clock down to one it never touched the iron and Washington with the rebound Fellers continues to do the job on offensive glass but the Demon Deacons unable to turn it into Second Chance points from the corner Withers yes a threepointer North Carolina back on top and jam wither shooting with c confidence in that corner we saw it from him seven times yesterday hasnt been as hot this evening however a big one on the last Applause possession haris back for Spillers open H with went for the tip couldnt quite reach it Davis wants to attack and kick Withers again and around it out its spun Applause 5756 Applause Carolina elt finds Salis P to guard him haris the youngster two strong and a lot of banging underneath and a foul at 332 to go they go to get jayen Wasing trying to keep Fon Reed off the glass Fon Reed does not want his career to be over possibly to going to one of those first four teams out any of that Fon Reed with the effort defensively and on the offensive class an opportunity to give the Demon Deacons the lead right back at the free throw line sevenfooter out of Richmond Virginia at the foul line with about three and a half to go in this quarterfinal makes Applause 73 and he has made it a 5757 game the 12th time we have been tied today another one on the Applause way and Reed cant hit that so its 57 Applause all Elliot cadoo back on the floor with the four fouls he and Vin Allen Luben playing in foul trouble for the Tar Hill Davis getting by hildr nice pass for Luben but knocked away from him and a whistle Harris with number five so Obie I told you my rule yesterday about if the ball goes up in the air it was a foul if the ball goes down its a clean because you got the basketball now I got a number of texts from my official friends thats saying thats not necessarily true so if we get a chance to see the replay on this one bill Covington looking at the ball going up in the air was there contact on the a two shots here for Luben he hits 67 in and out of number one as you see it great job s in slow motion that is all over the arm so the ball going straight up in the air proves my theory to be correct on that one OB thats old pickup game rule right there visual proof uhhuh and he makes one of two North Carolina up one and you also have to remember that flager foul from jke Harris would gave him that four and now takes him out of the game Frederickson in Luben with the block defending his basket beautifully North Carolina trying to build on the lead under three minutes winner moving on to the semifinal Duke awaiting the winner Davis catch his fires headset and a giant three as a coach nothing makes you happier than seeing that type of execution Elliot kadoo telling Vin Allen Luben no dont throw it to me RJs going to be open on the other side but also so is Vin Allen Luben who is on the floor but Hubert Davis has to have him on the floor to try to get a defensive rebound who will step up as the man for Wake Forest here in the last two and a half HTH over the top and it almost went on the alleyoop its going to be tipped out with 221 to go thats risky youre looking at a laa Ali oop down four on a very important possession W for is fortunate to get that one back off of what wasnt the best pass for the L on the line hildr commits the turnover weve had that happen four times today 219 to go and you see it often but you see the retreat step as you step backwards and which is a natural motion you cannot do it in that corner theres not enough space as you see the left foot of hild that heel coming down on the out of bounds line the officials of course looking for that call because it happen so Applause often Carolina up four and the Applause ball K back in running the point they going to try El stuff by Van Luben he went flying in for the Applause slam and a great pass by Canó and the lob execut it perfectly Salis fighting back for two a minute 47 to go and Hunter Sal is looking at the clock with concern of course more than enough time down four to be able to get back into this one but understanding that each and every possession becomes so important out back up top for Kad hell feed his Withers no and another Slam by Luben again from out of the sky to slam it down wow did did you talk about a couple of big play Hubert Davis is trying to get to 100 wins as the North Carolina head coach could do that with a W today still a minute 25 to go Reed for hildr hildr to the paints North Carolina Luke got in there deflecting that away and off of Wake Forest Elliot kadoo back into the lineup and Luben with another outstanding play Luben and jayen Withers both teaming up there to make it a very difficult opportunity for Cameron hildr and what has played the Demon Deacons all season long their inability to score down the stretch in tough moments and another example of that but give the tar Hills a tremendous amount of credit for locking up defensively at 10 lead changes in the second half alone in this game as we approach the one minute Mark in this quarter final North Carolina trying to avenge an earlier season loss to awake which came down to one point nine to get off a shot now for kdo withs set the screen Kad shot clock at two he sweeps inside he cant finish it Spillers wants to push it hildr will fire and it sticks right there possession arrow will keep it on his end but I believe the officials would go to the sideline and stop once the wedgie happened it was a dead ball I believe we lost another second or more on the clock Eric Lewis over at the official score table so about a second and a half came off yep 382 after the wedgie absolutely wedgie happens everything stops especially the clock and is that ever true deflected and stolen by pow right on the Baseline and way Force has the foul they get to tremble finally with 318 of course you dont want to turn the basketball over but after turning it over a couple of the Demon Deacons hung their head and forgot that they had to get a quick foul on the Tar Heels to try to save as many precious seconds as they could so thatll bring Trimble to the line now one of the better foul Shooters on the floor 82 to shoot two well short on number Applause one trying to get the lead to seven a number two for Seth Trimble to Applause Music Junior makes that one 6659 Ws got a hurry Salis gets a long one in the air he cant stick it and Steve for is trying to get his team to foul wake for is wow wake just walked away theyre walking away from it as if the game is over Steve for is having to yell at his team wow to go foul with 169 they finally stopped the clock but wait just started walking up the Flo like its over and Davis will go to the line all time 863 number one in North Carolina he has 22 the final has set in on Hunter sales Cameron hildr they know that they will know they will not participate in the NCAA tournament now it doesnt mean that their seasons over they can still get a bid to the NIT but but the dream was to play in the NCAA this season Salis with the drive cant follow his own Miss no sense to foul now 6859 North Carolina a hardfought victory today against W forest and the Tar Heels will play
