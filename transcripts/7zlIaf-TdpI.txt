um and uh just kind of stripped things down had time to practice got back to things defensively and uh got on this eame win streak Miami controls the opening tip of the traveling green old gold white and black at home for WN benley Joseph with a high degree of difficulty it goes out of bounds and it will stay at this end of the floor with the canes and one thing I want to look at too I just on the eye test that Wake Forest a decided height advantage over Miami see if that becomes a factor on the offensive glass Reed and Carr on the front line for the great Forest Demon Deacons but thats a three coming out right away Kean George firing but you know weve seen in other teams where injuries have benefited guys with playing time and this young man has been the beneficiary of injuries with Nigel pack earlier and now uh with wga popper that Kean George has really emerged as a the young star op missing his second straight game with an ankle injury Miami defeated number 16 Clemson in its most recent game W fors went to Boston College and won earlier this week and a foul on the play vley Joseph picks up the foul for Miami hler on that bench Mike and hes one guy that they cant have get into foul trouble build from the corner that was with three attempts batted around Carr kept it alive straight away thats for three and it bounces out Reed had it for a moment after that Miss by Salis couldnt hang on trying to go inside omir and nor Shadow May a little undersized but hell run the floor against these bigs that is Miller for Wake Forest keep an eye on him I I mean I dont know if theres any certainly any guy in the league whos done as well in the portal as Steve Forbes and this back court really Dynamic IE app a season ago two years ago Alis Williams was the player of the year in the ACC Nigel pack stepping back right near that W Forest bench missed two games with injury came back against Clemson with a monster game took him a half to get going but his second half he was fabulous pack had 20 points the second half against the Tigers 25 in total a game high and he made three threepoint baskets against Clemson its hildr bounces out car took a swipe at it here comes benley Joseph immediate three and transition watch out thats Matthew Cleveland the Florida state transfer thats what Mi will do they will run to the threepoint line and Steve Forbes talked about it yesterday that matching up it doesnt matter about your guy theyve got to get B body on body Salis into the paint the foul is called against Miami Kean George was in the vicinity I mean you know I was looking at these numbers and just across the sheet just ridiculous uh I mean you know for an individual those would be off the charts but those are team numbers guys and thats uh those are as good as Ive seen in 22 years at the college level on top of those numbers they make N9 and 1 12 threes game which is second best in the conference that last foul was assessed to Bensley Joseph so thatll be his second very early in this half and in fact Mike he has to go to that Lena bench and thats critical because he is their best perimeter Defender best on ball Defender and uh remember last year he was a guy who gave Tyree applebe fits in this game and uh he was the guy who is going to be guarding boopy Miller um so its uh thats hes a guy in this lineup who you really dont speak of a lot because of the scoring and the offense of the other guys but thats a big hit for this team so Joseph to the bench couple of free throws from Salis with leads with forest in scoring 18 and a half points per game that is fifth in the ACC and theres Cleveland again elevating yeah Jim Lena was talking about us at the beforeand he coming over he wanted to be more efficient offensively and shooting numbers 10 percentage points higher this year than they were last year at Florida State car finds the open man its hildr and its a three ball you know he has been so consistent he had he had a great first game um and uh 33 in that first game but then hes just been right around his average but there every single game thatll go out of bounds and two the initial indication had it going awake might have been deflected and the awarded to Miami yeah he said I dont miss that badly and uh Ry Sans was right on saying it got there was a piece of that youre talking about that game by hildr mik 33 points in the first game of the season against Elon most player this season everything else hes and nothing and one other game over 20 but everything else has been right around his average but very consistent Reed knocked away Salis on the handle hesitation into the paint and the kick Reed angular rebound and track down by George Reed does have one made three on the season hes now one of eight on the year might have got a piece of that shot by omir unable to save it doesnt matter that is demon Deacon basketball referees Ted valent they theyre going to confer about this and Ted Valentine I dont know was 100 sure about that call theyre going to keep it the way it is Ted Ted Valentine Ry stons and John Gaffney yeah John Gaffney and uh and uh Ted Valentine were the two referees on that side of the floor demon DS are 10 and three on the SE heing two and0 in conference play 8 and0 inside Joel kosine needed a last second threepointer from Andrew C defeat Bost the college on the road Reed down in the block the basket will KN count foul on the floor the win for the demon daks at Boston College was on Tuesday 8478 Mike they shot 53 as a team in that Victory on so Cleveland assessed he was Ser with that foul and I tell you about Fon Reed and we talked about him being in limbo because of the NCAA making a decision but that was such a hes been such a huge addition to this team in the last six seven games hildr made the shot hit the deck no problem for hildr and another three and Tom you know we laid out the numbers for Miami shooting the ball Wake Forest is not too far behind them in their offensive efficiency either George on the drive he went down here comes Miller hesitation to the rim for Miller ball goes out of bounds and a foul was called point game Miami has the lead on the road

with Natalie and Jonathan Stewart tonight at 7 on wccb Charlotte Music CW ACC basketball on the CW is brought to you by Pacific Life creating Financial Security for more than 100 50 years this is the 30th alltime meeting between Miami and Wake Forest now Miami lead the overall series 1613 but the beaks have dominated at home they are 102 against visiting Miami teams and trailing by one here early on in our first half of play on the CW so Miller going to the free throw line for Way Forest Mike this is Kevin boy Miller at the line 82 from the strike and uh its its been a while since Ive seen anybody as fast with the basketball as him incredable speed good decision maker too really has a a pretty good assisted turnover ratio last last three 16 assists six turnovers which is outstanding and Miller is fifth in the conference 43 assists per game and with the free throw wake is on a 70 run and this uh youll see this from Wake for a little pressure up the floor especially with Joseph out of the game one of their primary ball handlers hes out with two early fouls Christian Watson is into the lineup for Miami Nigel P thats another threepointer for pack yeah these are Big minutes for Christian Watson coming in number three hes in for uh Bensley Joseph but maybe putting a little pressure on on Pac to pick up offensively Nigel pack playing in his 100th career game as a transferred from Kansas State George pulls it in off the Miss and I think what I mentioned the size of Wake Forest that George at 68 is going to have to be a rebounder as well Cleveland misses on the drive HRI will bring it up for Wake Forest their eight game winning streak the best in the conference that spins off for a driving Miller Carr went to the deck couldnt hang on heres George Salis defending air straight away for three and whs out air can hit that shot Mike hes made eight threes on the season part of his game thats expanded a little bit uh really no offensive glass presence for Miami that Applause time AJ Casey is coming into the game for Miami well see if the bench for Miami can get into the scoring column at least somebody this game but against Clemson starter scored scored all 95 points in that game they made 11 threepointers as well so Cleveland is now on the bench with Coach Lena this is Salis to the corner itll go itll be a three Frederickson and thats thats his hes had hes two of three from two on the year stolen by hildr from George triying to go up the sideline and a foul is called First on George and Steve forb said one of the best shooters that hes ever recruited thats pretty High Praise but but uh he comes in locked and loaded Off the Bench had nine points in the win at Boston College as Mike mentioned all of those nine points by coming by way of the threepoint shot HRI travel back to Miami there it is twopoint field thats thats on the year folks thats not for the game two of three so now hes up to 24 made threes and on you know on the other side too I mean kesan George we talked about him and how his role is expanded on the year six of 18 from the twopoint line so hes also not I wouldnt go so far to say threepoint specialist but thats where his game ISS have also nine of their last 10 games including wins against Florida ruter home here against Virginia Tech in conference play and the win on the road at BC for their 2 and0 ACC record hildr Another threepointer you know he hasnt he hasnt taken a ton of them this year but he 46 maybe in Steve Forbes encouraging him to look for that shot a little bit more P trying to get the bounce car another rebound well you can see Miami isnt even sending anybody to the offensive glass Huff again rattles home of three not even thinking about it hes got 12 points all on threepoint baskets for hildr the lead is six for Wick Forest denied at The Rim Casey to hurry up and get back in the play Salis explodes to the rim and lays it in theres the balance in the offense you saw Miami really spread out guarding the threepoint line Salis just put his head down and went to the rim no shop blocking out there for Miami this is pack open spaces for a three hildr had it for a moment it rolls along the Baseline past Carr and that will be Miami basketball the demon deakes launching from threepoint distance to build an eightpoint Music lead so Robo curly fire my CH got skin heart feelingson

take you anywhere it matters where you stay Hilton for the stay I think college basketball is one of those things you have to have a short mentality like short mental uh any mistake you have to be on to the next play and hes one of the guys that taught me that as my freshman year you know I used to get frustrated when a few turnovers or a Miss shot and he just you know always told me that never to worry about it too much just think about the next play and just move on so I think thats one of the best things that hes taught me so far and Cameron hildr is already into double digits in scoring in this game with 12 Mikey is four of five from Beyond The Ark some Pace to score 60 Tom and thats uh now we got something well see now now hes a got well hes he does even his mind isnt even turned on at this point I mean hes in hes in that zone and uh not even thinking about his his shot just hes reacting out on the floor he had made eight 18 threes prior to the start of today hes got four already yep and I I think for right now that Jim Lena and Miami are just kind of in survival mode for this half to get get through this half keep it close get benley Joseph back for that second 20 minutes remember they put 70 on CL or 60 on Clemson in the second half of that game trying to interrupt an 110 run by Wake Forest though mere crafty move around the rim although he f awkwardly Mike near the St and uh and that was his first basket of the game so hes a guy they really need to get going looks like hes great Up and Under move right there just and he was it happened cuz he was looking back at the play now Solus went down with him I dont know if he tripped over him he was he was looking back up at the basket to make sure that it went in and thats when he fell down in the midst of this fourgame winning streak for omir hes averaging 23 points 10 boards and shooting 72 of those four victories he he has been so so consistent and consistently at a high level HRI Frederickson kept it alive to Salis little to midrange Carr trying to wrestle it away from Cleveland and the arrow will favor Way Forest heres the offense rebounding presence for Wake Forest that I talked about at the open and uh really its a great play by by the uh other freshman Frederickson to keep that alive initially off the inbounds its deflected Frederickson runs it down and hangs on to it Carr who hit that clutch three with 11 12 seconds to go at Boston College it was his only basket of the game provided the winning margin Frederickson for three George ran it down Keller ran into him and picked up the Applause foul first on Zack Keller and he will hustle over that was the first that was the first team foul for Wake Forest W and this is uh this is trust in a player that uh Jim Len has put eny Joseph back out there with the two personal Applause fouls this is George Salis recovered defensively also got a piece of Salis and so the foul will Music be so is Salis who deflected it away were trying to figure out who fouls on one going to put George at the free throw line either way we get you that info in a sec now Ted Valentine is over the SC it is on Sal on Sal yep couple of free throws George at the line it was funny you know I I asked for um I asked I asked Jim L guys said hes George coming into the game six of six from the free throw line on the year I said you know this guy has hes so good offensively can he get to the line more and he said you know he was so thin when he got to school and he grew a couple inches and hes been catching up on his strength that uh hes more perimeter oriented now he will get to the point where he becomes a finisher inside but hes not quite there yet he is still perfect from the line as well as the kanes are going to get the ball back Miami is the best preow shooting team in the conference and third in the nation at 80 yeah I mean when youre when youre up over 80 as a team they four they have four starters who are over 84 and Matthew Cleveland is the low he was the low guy at 77 amongst the starters so you know end game theyre in good shape theres Cleveland with a Miss he averages 15 1 12 points per game unable to come up with that jump up for Cleveland who has five pack leads the away with six shes got a couple of Threes Salis to the Applause rim I think I think Steve Forbes needs to send Mark f a thank you note out of Gonzaga for Reed and Sal Le and Applause Sal Solis wasnt happy with his playing time averaged 15 minutes a game out of Gonzaga now hes leading the conf here in playing time so n no complaints there 35 minutes a game so hildr is going to the bench Millers back in he wears number Applause Music zero thats Amir on the inside Reed held his ground Reed and strong body he can match amirs strength also such a huge vocal presence on that defense in the back line which you need from your big guys this is Salis George is defending car sent it back out Frederickson catching release par offensive glass knocked around and well keep it at this end of the Applause floor so it looks like prir has shaken off the after effects of running into the St and getting caught up with Salis underneath the basket after he scored earlier in this half Miller is also a transfer mik from Central Michigan spent two years in that program Salis launching George lost the handle to Miller inside of 9 minutes to go in the first half of play were glad that youre with us for CW Courtside Saturday Tom mmy Mike jsky our outstanding crew savis came up short heres pack pack puts it up for omir and got high enough to tip it in yeah runs the floor extremely well like talk a little undersized Miami likes to play at a faster Pace than Wake Forest does its four points now in the first half from Dad omir seventh in the conference 18 points per game and third in rebounding Up and Under looking for the style points Salis didnt get it heres Cleveland pack trying to get pass two Defenders and pack puts it in so smooth and effective Mike W theyre guarding him they taking him off the threepoint line and showing him that he can finish in the lane thats now eight points for Niger pack coupled of Threes as well to his credit hes up to 265 career made threes for Nigel pack in the corner Reed too much on that one car fought for it as he does almost every possession to preserve it and get it to Salis Whos On Target from threepoint real estate and see I mean look for Miami there were five guys in the paint for them and Carr came up with the ball recycled The Possession and wake gets a three Miami has got to get that basketball great hustle play by Carr nine points for Applause Salis shot clock is inside of 10 George just weaving his way Amir is there to clean it up good work on the glass omir now hes down again Mike well hes an outstanding offensive rebounder and hes getting up hes not getting up this time he is on the floor five on four at the other end its a layup for Salis but omir is favoring that right leg right leg y so nor Chad omir trying to find his way to the Miami bench Miami in Wake Forest fivepoint Music Applause game Im a cop yeah on a cop you have a badge not yet not ever were not Partners shes a

Miami North Shadow Mir able to put some weight on that leg he was favoring the right leg on the way to the bench heres the play Mike underneath yeah you can see it it didnt come down on anything its a second effort right here you see the right just tweak a little bit uh didnt roll it completely over which is good news uh thats something that you can maybe shake off he had some help coming back to the bench but weve seen him during this timeout hes been running up and down the sideline might require a little bit extra taping uh dont want to speculate at this point but hes and theres wiga popper who has missed missed the Clemson game wont play today because of an ankle injury as well and that was a wind mik at home on Wednesday Coral Gables against number 16 Clemson 9582 yeah and uh Jim Lena again benley Joseph back on the floor second turnover now for the freshman Kean George this is Miller into the paint tries to get rid of the Defenders and it bounces in for poopy Miller and hes got five points well Miller makes a smart Play Because Bley George or Bley Joseph has to lay off him and he just he went in attack mode went right at him smart Applause play Miller the red shirt sophomore from Chicago Illinois who had 17 points and the win at Boston College and now a foul is and see if youre Fon Reed I mean yeah youre going to you want to hedge strong on that screen but youve got him going laterally 30 ft from the basket you cant pick up a foul in that situation there a team Miami 37 from the floor George trying to improve that percentage and he will with a three ball and you leave him alone like that on the off the screen and hes hes got hes playing with a lot of confidence early in the year maybe you can get away with that but not now as we showed you earlier in the half as Joseph almost took it away and then committed a foul and thats going to be number three and and see Joseph has got to know better than that I Music mean I think he was encouraged Mike by the fact that he almost had the steal the first time yeah but look I mean trying to go for that play to pick up you know what thats that is that is really costly 50 ft away from the basket us so Joseph three personal fouls in the first half back to the bench Watson is in 542 and rolling with Miller on the shot came up short you know its its funny too you look at the stats of Jim l rarely plays a guy with two personal fouls and he was he was going against his his instincts in that situation and uh hey but with him uh you know a guy that uh you trust and guy whos played a lot for you and so Frederickson is going to the way for his patch Salis is in double digits in the first half with 11 hild with his four threepointers which by the way is a career high hes got 12 points to Marion is at the free throw line Marcus Marian freshman from Denmark Tuesday on inside the NFL nobody breaks down games like our crew with highlights and Analysis you wont find anywhere else this week the guys take a look back at the last week of the regular season plus they preview super Wildcard Weekend Inside the NFL Tuesday 87 Central only on the CW fellow countrymen of mine my mother bris was born in Denmark 36 just have celebrated a birthday Salis got a piece of the Watson shot attempt also got a piece of Applause Applause Watson so Miller gets the foul its his first Salis was there as well yeah theyve got to sort this out Im not sure if Miller was anywhere near the play and in fact they have changed it now to Salis thats his second Salas was the only way for us defending in the vicinity for sales whos the leading scorer in fifth of the conference away course now with his second personal Applause Music foul good sign for Miami fans nor shadir able to come back into the lineup trying to shake off the after effects of the ankle and Steve Forbes is going to leave Silas in there with two fouls see how that trust Factor works out out this is Miller pack trying to stay with him Reed and traffic lays it Applause in so Reed who averages nine points and nine rebounds in the Box Score as far as scoring is concerned he certainly altered that shot yeah but the numbers theyre going to climb the last three games have been outstanding for him they tried to get it inside two him broke it up and deflected Away by AJ KAS yeah Reed playing in just his seventh game at a wake uniform early December got the double transfer waiver from the NCAA yeah hes just uh hes just rounding into shape right now at the right time for them KC turns and hits yeah any offense they get from him is going to be a big plus averaging three points a game but uh certainly uh with benley Joseph in the foul trouble and his 13 points or nine points out of the game they need a lift Salis working the Baseline against George George pretty nice defense byes stop him and then a foul was called against w Forest so well step aside but just inside 4 minutes to go in our first half in a fourpoint game Deeks have the lead on the

Pacific Life game summary presented by Pacific Life creating Financial Security for more than 150 Music years this threepoint shooting has really kept Miami in and this is what theyve done done for most of the year you saw the outstanding shooting and of course C H has also done an outstanding job hes been a little quiet recently but though he was a huge factor and then Bley Joseph with this third personal foul that a big factor not it wont actually it wont not just be a factor in this half its going to carry over to the second half Miller the steel and he lays it in Wake Forest by six theyve led by as many as eight in the first half and thats Salis now with his third personal foul of the first Applause half and he is walking right to that wake bench big exhale from Steve Forbes this is really I I dont know that I can remember a first half where two key players have come up with three personal fouls Kean George is at the line Salis has 11 points hildr leads the way with 12 for Wake four of 10 shooting and benley Joseph has not scored and only attempted one field goal he also has three personal fouls in the first half and this is in the absence of wga poppler missing his second straight game for Miami with an ankle injury hildr a careerhigh four made threes but those really in the first eight minutes of the game Miller front rim and omir nine and a half rebounds per game for nor Chad omir third best of the ACC this is pack Keller rips it down Frederickson h tried to get the defenders in the air with a fake it got knocked out of bounds by Miami itll stay with Wake Forest and in this game thats the best possible world for Miami to to defensively drive hildr off the threepoint line make him shoot inside Cameron hildr the Junior from Worthing England 18 points against Boston College made three threepointers that was his career high prior to today Fall Away no good and Watson at 67 is a little tougher cover for him it hes got the length and to bother his shot George rocking the three ball and its 68 he can see over Frederickson and Frederickson right with him that was a contested shot just a better better offense and George has now tied his season high with 13 points in the game Mike he came in averaging six points per game and hes doing it for Miami in the first half well against Clemson most of this scoring came in the first half as well the other guys picked it up in the second half but he was the one who held him in the game early Miller ripping the ropes for the Demon Deacons and 10 points double digits poopy Applause Miller Miller 37 of the season from Beyond The Arc and hes got his first three on his first threepoint attempt of the game late in the first half like just a great battle with Miller and pack going at each other Miami travels Wake Forest Applause basketball H with that defense yeah and Ill give George credit that you know at least now hes trying to put the ball on the floor attack the basket maybe make people think that hes going to you know try to get to the rim to open up his threepoint shooting from the Baseline Miller popped back out by Carter Frederickson Miller thats a tough shot he was twisting to get that shot away and he got fouled yeah but you know what hes hes good enough from three that it sets up his drive and hes so quick that uh man hes a just a nightmare to defend Nigel pack picked up his first personal for Miami and you and you look at him Tomy I mean hes not you know hes not the tallest guy in the world obviously but he is hes strong and hes got the body he can go inside and absorb some contact and finish 82 from the line for Miller this season so tomorrow on the CW womens Hoops in Charlottesville is Duke looks to make its Mark against Virginia Duke Virginia tomorrow noon

Subaru halftime report well get the recap of pit and Louisville a win for the Panthers their first in conference play preview of The Duke Virginia Womens game tomorrow on the CW at noon and our first half highlights and stats thats coming up on the Subaru halftime report from Winston Salem North Carolina you know normally you got two your key key guys with two fouls you keep an eye on them and see how they come out in the second half but with soles and Joseph with three personal fouls really going to look and see how they are attacked offensively and how they play coaches are going to have to be very selective about the lineups with the foul trouble presented to both teams here in the first half as we move to the second in 20 minutes Carr able to get it back and Carr is going on a rim Bender he couldnt catch it but deflected it against the rim and came up after it and this is length paid off that time nobody else in there to back up the defense first basket of the game for the senior Andrew Carr from Westchester Pennsylvania and a transfer from Delaware that is George missing from Beyond The Ark final 15 seconds Miami now six of 10 on threepoint Applause tries so Watson picked up the foul for Applause Miami everybody up here Mike in the lower bowl at Joel Memorial Coliseum now were sitting Courtside and everybody is standing so we have to stand just to see the action kind of a a senseless foul that time to give away a possible two points is a one inone situation this is our but they we are court side M they got tangled they got tangled up but the Hilder the line for one and one thank you for that all right so hildr is at the free throw line makes the Applause first help big first half for Applause hildr Miss on the second one and George what happened George lost his balance fell into the lane and caused the lane violation so hilders going to get watch watch on the right side there fell in while hes in his shooting motion hes going to get a third shot 14 first half points for Cameron hildr thereve been a lot of odd things going on in this half time he averages 16 per game hes almost got his average in the first half and a Timeout on the court 10 point

of Fame class last year at Miami cross the way Salis ISM foul trouble Bley Joseph has three personal fouls Miami the second school he took to a final four George Mason that great run all those years ago and then Miami last year 2006 he took George Mason to the final four pack with the kick from the corner miss out of the corner scrap for the loose ball KY couldnt hit it and thats it for the first half 4437 the lead for Wake Miami will put it in play 41 as a team in the first half for Miami well below their season average of 51 best in the ACC and eighth in the nation George couldnt run down the pass out of bounds and Wake Forest Music Solace actually started off on Bley Joseph whos of the starters the lowest scorer on the teame but Bley Joseph starting off on Miller pack able to knock away the entry pass trying to work on the bigger car Cleveland literally zero on zero and zero Cleveland for Miami yeah that one but about a five or 6 inch height difference there on the switch so did a great job taking him into the post using that nine points now for Matthew Cleveland omir came out of nowhere to block it save by Cleveland pack fake the pass and laid it in wow great look off on the run and Miami doing a great job scoring at about 3 seconds in transition down to a threepoint game hildr lining up a three Carr on the weak side fighting with Joseph out of bounds and that is we got we got one we got conflicting information Ted Valentine pointing one way and the other two officials pointing the other way and Ted Valentine is going to overrule it cuz he was on the Baseline that was a great lookoff on the break and almost and we got guys sliding around and then yeah Nigel pack never got back into the play yeah pack is being helped up right Applause now pack is favoring the right leg and hes going to the bench and that was a again that was a non contct injury he just slid after making that layup and he is in some pain again before the Clemson game he missed two games due to the injury in that LE was in that same foot they classified it as a lower extremity injury hildr all the way across Salis out of the corner head of steam does knock at the bounce ball right back to him in in front rim George tried to get around hildr who might have bumped him H foul and Miami really has to rebound as a unit its a first on hildr and thats pack at the end of the bench double digits for pack with 10 points on four of eight shooting and a couple of Threes Joseph playing with three personal fouls hes yet to score in the game George threepointer and what hildr fell down trying to get around that screen and that gave George a clean look new season high with 16 points for keesan George well how many I think uh announcers around the league were going to be saying new season High a lot this year with him four of six on threepointers for George including that one moments ago Salis wants that three good hand up on the jump shot that time by George Joseph trying to get around Miller Applause at the other end Salis right into a road block Miller is wide open for a three and makes no mistake and hes good enough you have to honor that wide open that time 37 from three but that really just sets up his driving Applause game 14 points five of 11 shooting and two for two on threes from Miller really good balanced scoring for Wake so far three guys in double figures Cleveland omir trying to help out foul coming up against W Forest its on Music Miller its the first on Miller wake led by seven at halftime the lead is three kind of odd see a foul on a point guard on an offensive rebounding play as I must have been going for the steel its another quick foul against wake second on HRI Mike Applause Music y already three team fouls for wake and you dont want to put Miami at the free throw line Earl in a bonus best free throw shooting team of the conference shock loock is is down to 10 for Joseph little jab step frees him up misses the shot omir and Reed got tangled up underneath Jim Lena told us before the game that he wants benley Joseph to look at more threes hes hes confident in his ability to make those 41 on the Applause year Joseph with that one three attempt in the game hes attempted 45 this season and made 18 hildr pounds it into the floor he got fouled going to the basket told you Miami is the best team in the ACC from the line Wake Forest is second best in fourth in the country no I you know its its been a while I was looking at both of these teams offensive shooting percentages side by side and uh it it was it was pretty astounding really really great numbers and there we saw a pack looked like he was hes trying to get back into the game that right ankle looked at yeah trying to lace up that right shoe 16 points now for hildr thats above his season average of 158 84 on the season from the line for hildr Salis with the Applause steel Carr on the Block twisting move bucket and foul Andrew Carr and this was just great anticipation by Salis getting up and theyve really got nobody down low who can contend with Carr sizewise a good move good aggressive move omir with the foul one shot saw him he was he uh hurt himself early in the game so not a bad idea to attack him so Carr unable to complete the old school threepoint Music play omir into the corner Cleveland shot clock inside of 10 for Joseph this time he hits the net first points of the game Bensley Joseph yeah theres again thats he was very aggressive and looking for that Applause three I think a guy offensively you know especially with pack out that Matthew Cleveland is one for Miami hes he may have to look for his own offense a little bit more nine points in the game for Cleveland down to five on the shot clock for Miller leans into that one does not get the roll fight for the loose ball Millers in there Casey was in there as well shot clock ran out so well sort it out when we come back benley Joseph into the box score with that threepointer the first of the game for the Ley Miami traving by four some people just know that the best rate for you is a rate based on you with all state because you know that just because it fits

there Applause jump and there was a jump so they call it a jump ball its wake fors ball with 20 seconds to go on the shot clock got it end result John gapy kind enough to come over and share the ruling with the AllAmerican from duke Mike jinsky early on in our second half wake led by seven and halftime shock at eight for Carr Salis driving on pack volley balled out by Reed third Chance in This possession now for way galz double and triple teamed on the Baseline hildr Carr shot clock down to seven Carr came up short Carr really bailes Miami out when hes out on the perimeter taking shots like that but tell you Miamis got to be aware wake through a nice job of tapping the ball out instead of getting offensive rebounds their perimeters got to be aware eight of 21 on threepoint shots for Wake thats pack on the drive omir gobbles up the rebound back up an in nor Chad omir best offensive rebounder in the conference nobody had a body on him eight points now for omir third in the ACC and rebounding Im showing you why right there with the putb Salis Salis took a tumble as pack tried to impede his progress both of those players hit the deck and the foul is on pack we seeing a lot of toughness from guys omir out you know goes out with that ankle gets retap comes back in pack the same way if Im Solas Im going to try to test him off the dribble make him move around that was a second foul on Nigel pack hey hey Miller slamming on the brakes and hitting the little jumper yeah you know its if when youre injured you can choreograph your moves offensively but defensively when you have to react thats when things show up 16 points in the game for Kevin bopy Miller the red shirts off for and as fast as Miller is You got to be 100 to guard him hildr came away with it and omir almost picked up a bad third foul Miller thought about a 25footer then lost the handle pack behind the back Amir hildr recovered Reed had it now hildr gets it back hes on the Run he goes behind the back with the dribble Miami gets it back got a little too cute on the dve on the break that time George lining up a three and he makes it for the canes 19 points P John George talk about it a guy a freshman who is uh turning into a sophomore right before our eyes season high before today for George was 13 he had 12 in the Clemson Victory just a poor entry pass by Solis that time pack is at least 5T behind the line and a misfire thats what Miami will do though Mike theyll take those open shots and transition no and that thats something you know that thats not a bad shot for this Miami team hildr trying to go past George he hit the deck car over the top of George he wrestled it away from everybody and aside from the shooting George doing a nice stop in the glass and a finish on the other end by

talked about it didnt really factor in that second half against Clemson but made a key three and then that rebound and Outlet pass to Cleveland in that run and uh you see right there giving Miami this lead and the thing you know and a good timeout but and Steve Forbes trying to wait for that Under 12 minute Mark knowing that that media timeout was coming but he couldnt let that run go another few seconds so now the first lead of the second half for Miami we were tied briefly in this second half kesan George Miami gets it back now with Cleveland ill advised attempt that time by Miller on the pass so well take another quick timeout come back to Winston Salem in just a moment so onepoint game five made threes from George this Sunday its CW women tubes Richardson cant be stopped Reagan

Miami has a onepoint lead 53 5453 against Wake Forest CW Courtside Saturday returns next week another exciting double header Louisville with NC State trying to stay hot against the Cardinals then to South Bend for the Irish in Florida State you can see NC state has already won today Mike and so theyre now 3 and0 yeah people not talking about them in the ACC race undefeated and uh and on that last play Kean George not on the floor right now and took it it actually ran in to Matthew Cleveland MC state has won four in a row now to go to three and0 in conference Play heres Cleveland thats off Target omir earning free throws Keller was underneath with omir you know I just there are guy the the great offensive rebounders just they are great re has always seem to be where the ball is and uh he just is always there there you see him on the S line you we we saw the replay they just they ran into each other and he just got a shot right below the ribs trying to shake it off hes got nine made threes in the last two games Mike and got five in this one and and for this game its not just his scoring but uh he was tied with omir for team leading rebounds with six and against this bigger wake team its a big stat this afternoon kesan George the Freshman has stepped up his play the absence of popper and Joseph in foul trouble and now 10 points for omir to double digits thats 11 games in a row double figure scoring and 13 this season for nor cadir to double digits so Miamis taking a threepoint lead trying to tie it up Frederickson thats exactly what he does you talk about a guy not a freshman not shying away from a big possession we are tied at 56 wake needed a huge lift and he stepped up couple of Threes in the game now for Frederickson Joseph behind the back and stolen Miller one on two doesnt matter he lays it Applause in why did he make that Applause pass time out Miami I think coach Larona asking the same question youre he was right at the rim and this turned into the first pass of the fast break and only pass of the Fast Break 18 points from Miller 7 of 14 an easy two on the layup after the turnover anded W Forest has taken a twopoint lead you get the feeling Mike these two teams are going to be regardless of the outcome this afternoon they will be factors in this race for an ACC Championship this season as George will return after getting a breather running into his teammate Cleveland well and and the good news actually for both of these teams is that both Solace and uh benley Joseph have not picked up that fourth foul to this point point so you can exhale a little bit if youre Steve Forbes or Jim Lona but that that was that was I Im mystified about that last turnover Bley Joseph was almost to the rim still in the game and controlling for Miami which finished the regular season 15 and five in the ACCC a year ago as the number one seed Miss from pack card got it but Reed picks up the foul and see thats what and this is this is nor shadir one on four working for the offensive glass and he forces the foul third on Reed thats just hard work off the inbounds Cleveland and right now wakes uh two fouls away from putting Miami at the free throw line and Cleveland has Titus at 58 13 points Matthew Cleveland and hes gotten more aggressive in the last 5 minutes offensively looking for his shot tied his career high with 23 points in the win against Clemson earlier this week rickon lines it upir the Applause Music Applause rebound eight rebounds in the game for omir Carr has eight rebounds to lead the way for Wake theres the midrange from pack well he got the switch and uh he was all alone on the right side with Carr so I I mean Carr he basically was a win for him to get the jump shot 12 points for Nigel pack double digits 10 times this season for the Junior from Indianapolis Indiana Salis into the paint dropped it for Carr for the jam for weight I mean its you know with with Carr and Reed thats those are at 4 five thats a load along the Baseline especially against Miami theres not a lot of size out there tied again at 60 Joseph trying to untie us off the glass and bounces Applause out Salis misses George up ahead Applause pack Joseph right at Reed foul four four on Reed and the key thing here now this now he makes the smart play that when you can get shooting files that are adding to your team fouls you know all the better especially later in the second half so theyre one away from the bonus but now you get Joseph and we talked about how efficient Miami starters are at the free throw line Joseph 84 seven of nine as a team from the line is Reed will come out of the lineup for weight fact three fresh players coming in including hildr and the big the big thing about Reed is that he defensively is their best communicator and he is the guy who directs the traffic on the back line defensively 102 from benley Joseph Christian Watson back into the lineup Joseph has four points in the game its a good time you got all right youre coming up on the under eight media timeout so good move by Jim Lena to get benley Joseph out by byy him a minute or so Applause here 16 points in the game for hildr Miller leads the way with 18 not currently on the floor for Wake Salis missing on the Applause three nine of 24 for Wake On threes that was deflected came away yeah hildr nice job defensively and he got the block on the jump shot hildr who last year had a triple double just the third in school history kicks it to the corner Fredrickson Keller preserving The Possession to Applause Salis wake had its chances and now Cleveland comes away with it onepoint lead Miami Applause entry omir catching basket well he did a nice job there trying to front him but he moved Keller up the lane to give him some space to catch 12 points for nadir 51st game in a Miami uniform Solace has been a little quiet in this half drive and kick Maran hildr threepoint attempts money for hild boy they need him to finish like he started this game Tom five made threes in the game on eight tries for Cameron hildr pack creates space offensive Applause foul time out on the court tied at 63 on CW Courtside Music Applause Saturday

program that only made the NCAA tournament once since 2010 you could have made a strong argument for last year and I I think they should have made it last year but thats last year and uh you know for this year you got theyve got to take advantage against the upper echelon teams in the league especially here at home and thats why this game today against Miami is critical they they really need this win 19 wins a season to go for Wake Forest in 2022 they made it to the NIT and lost in the quarters after a couple of wins in that tournament China remain perfect on their home floor as well Mike 80 so far this season here at Joel Coliseum its its great to see the atmosphere like this back here again also trying to snap a four game losing streak in the series shot clock is a 10 for hildr cross it over down the lane spin it off the glass out of bounds on the Baseline Miami basketball but they had that one that one Reckless turnover that Miami did uh but other than that wake has really had to grind for a lot of their offense in the second half not a lot of easy baskets Fredericks into the bench for Wake hes hit a couple of Threes demon de have made 10 threepointers nine made threes for Applause Miami solid sitting there hes four of 17 in the game hes had a tough afternoon they need him to come alive Cleveland from the wing for the kanes yeah hes hes really been uh hes been money for them over this last stretch 15 points for Music Cleveland Salis cut off on the Baseline wake third best threepoint shooting team in the conference Carr thought about one gave it to hildr thats for three both sides of the rim omir had it knocked Away by Salis hustling after that ball to the front row Miami ball almost great the great individual play but couldnt come up with Applause it despite that Miss by hildr with Reed still on the bench four personals 19 points for hildr careerhigh five made threepointers on nine attempts three players in double digits for Miami led by George with Applause 19 Music Applause Cleveland its way wedged it right between the the basket and the flange and laid in and he had car switched up on Miamis really taking advantage when theyve gotten that switch foul on George Clevelands up to 17 points in the game and hes got to take hes got to be careful cuz the freshman isnt going to get a lot of latitude with the whistle second foul on kesan George again he leads Miami with 19 points and five made threes season high for him thats nine made threes in his last two games for George and seven rebounds as well probably a season high in that category hildr Keller how about Keller hits a two two out of the corner big basket for him only averaging just under three points a game so big late offense for him Miami by two Cleveland he had made those last two midrange jumper not jumpers not this time approaching the fourminute threshold as they go inside the car spinning double team and foul shooting thats just six fouls for Miami so the next one theyre in the bonus both teams sitting there with six Jim Lena with 736 career victories 11 and six in his career against Wake Forest 266 of those on the Miami b bench and Steve Forbes across the way fourth season hes won 60 games he and uh he and Leonard Hamilton the old Lions left in the in the league you aint kidding Jim baheim retiring last year Mike shashki and uh Roy Williams before that Keller just made that jumper from the other Corner thats you know with with Reed out with those fouls big minutes for Keller this is Miller little ball fake over the front rim and down 20 points for Miller fourth time this season hes done that tied at 67 great ball fake Joseph in a congested area dropped it off to omir for the jam for Miami what a great play by benley Joseph though and uh just all omir had to do was make himself available 14 points omir see now now at this point with only three fouls that benley Joseph can get physical again defensively omir deflects the pass Miami com back from trailing by seven at halftime see you got now you got the Clevelands got to take advantage of that matchup theyve got theyve got car on him omir grabbed that shot couldnt put it back up on end surprised he missed that six of 13 shooting 14 points omir Salis working hard inside trying to tie this game did a nice job yeah did a nice job taking advantage of the mismatch with with pack 13

years Zack Keller first basket of the game Mike now big big minutes with Eon Reed out with foul trouble and then boy Miller the beautiful fake inside then the nice dish by benley Joseph Salis with the uh taking advantage over pack hes been quiet but hit a big bucket there late and here we are 6969 231 left in the second half three lead changes seven ties going right down to the wire with two and a half minutes to go in regulation I tell you Matthew Cleveland has got the matchup with uh with Andrew Carr on him thats pack a floater omir ferocious rebound on the offensive blast and he puts it in and thats just thats kind of oldtime stuff with him just he just goes after every single shot and thinks its going to miss and he thinks every Miss is his a double double with 16 points and 11 boards for nshadow Meir seventh double double of the Season he leads the AC in that category Miller shot clock winding down he leans in and hits 71 all everybody up inside Joel Applause Coliseum George lost it on the Baseline Miami will maintain Applause possession so itll be Joseph on the inbounds yeah you know George has had some loose possessions with the basketball you want the ball in benley Josephs hands George he needs to be a finisher yeah Reed needs to be a little careful here he and he and omir going at a little bit Ry Steins trying to clean things up a little three playing with four fouls omir attacking him and kicking this is Joseph got the defender in the air missed the shot got it back Second Chance Cleveland comes out of nowhere weak side and the foul now the basket is not going to count theyre going to wave that off Applause and so hildr picks up the foul his third to put Joseph at the line Miamis won four in a row six of its last seven Wake Forest has won eight in a row nine of its last 10 the final 1 minute 15 seconds of this Collision Course culminating this afternoon in Winston Salem and and no team in neither team in the double bonus yet so still be one and one if they just regular foul big free throws at a twopoint lead Miami Miller trying to shed the defender that one rims out omir grabs the rebound were inside of a minute to play twopoint Miami lead pack shot clock inside of 10 for Cleveland needs some help C blade Applause Music traveled no thats he got to a St that was actually pretty nice defense right there and thats you know he he just got caught yeah right there yeah just uh he was in in no mans land and we talked about you know you get the you get the five count when your dribble is picked up and you think he got a little nervous Miller Reed went flying out toward midc Court trying to set a screen hildr trying to work the Applause Baseline one and one fourth on George so thing Music now makes two but Miami will have the last shot of the Applause game hildr eighth in the C for 8 84 hes the guy they want there trying to tie us Applause up six for six from the line 21 points for hildr final 22 seconds tied at Applause 73 coach Lena wanted a timeout it got poked Away by Salis the timeout was granted so couple of clutch free throws at both ends really Joseph made two it mhm the Miami in and then coming back with the one inone situation for hild and he makes two to tus at Applause 73 so Miller and hildr combining for 43 points of this game Miami has the basketball mic theyve got four players in double digits George leads the way with 19 Well here heres there two things that wake has to contend with here one you cant zero in on one guy but the thing that Miamis got they can they can do they can get something hitting the lane you have to account for omir you almost have to face guard him and give up a guy on the glass just to keep him off the play and thats the thing for Miami theyre going to go in get something to hit the lane and make sure that you give him enough time if it should Miss to work on the offensive glass 16 points and 12 rebounds for omir so this was the attempted request that a timeout Joseph and you can see Jim Lena telling him timeout timeout so was the official there is John Gaffney so going it could be as much as a second and a half added on back onto it so Ry stons and John Gaffney are trying to calculate what should be left in Applause regulation so and Miami is still Miami still has a timeout so if they they having issues getting the ball in but being able to use the back court they still you know that that should not be an issue theyve adjusted the clock mic by a couple of seconds Music 176 so again you know at the end of this you know as this play unfolds I mean youve got to find omir and just get completely face guard him and get him off the play Joseph on the inbounds omir hands it off the pack 15 seconds could be a high pick and roll looks like with and then roll him in 12 points in the game for pack guarded by Miller final seconds Cleveland for the win in and out for Cleveland they went me wake played an OT game against LSU in mid November and lost 8680 Salis elevating so it was Matthew Cleveland who had the chance to be the hero not to say that he wont be at Day end but he had that final shot inside George what a feed from omir got him lifted so no bigs inside for Wake Force opening up things and you know theyre paying attention to George on the threepoint line hes starting to do some more work in the lane about 21 points kesan George Miller batted out by Reed right to George and good job of him hanging around quick three attempt Cleveland this is pack hopping back behind the line Nigel pack for three and Matthew Cleveland one on four four white jerseys in there comes up with the offensive rebound recycles the play and gets a three for his team 15 points for pack on the first five points of the OT period belong to Miami its a jam from George and a three from pack yeah heres the look thats a great back door Fe thats a great pass weve been singing uh amirs play praise about everything and then pack just you know hes just a solid offensive player so Cleveland picked up the foul Carr is at the Music Applause line get it Music did not get the kind bounce batt it out to Miller by Applause Reed Carr actually leading wake in ass assists in this game with five hildr got caught in the air George knocked it away hild just somehow got it back and a Fest called against the canes Applause heres the look and you know again with with George long arm 68 grew this actually grew a couple of inches from when Jim Lena recruited him in high school when he got on campus hild Rock Solid from the free throw line in 22 points hit the two free throws to tie this game to send it into Applause overtime 23 points for hildr twopoint game after his free throws hes now eight of eight from the free throw line high level of entertainment value this afternoon Winston Salem North Carolina on the CW with wake in Miami Cleveland the kick omir down the lane lost the handle demon Deacon basketball yeah theyve had him lifted at that high post and hes normally pretty good with the basketball off the dribble 12th turnover of the game for Miami as we play it over overtime with 3 minutes to go in the extra session spinning Salas hes got it were tied 78 all 15 points Salas yeah hes been able to take advantage of that uh mismatch M pack getting him into the lane off the dribble Joseph salot the rebound Miami had the first five points of the OT period now that Wake Forest has a chance to take the lead car saves it in the corner Im wondering if sometime if they may pull Joseph off of Miller put him on Solace Reeds pass batted out by omir with nine on the shot clock you know as as Laren AER told us before the game about you know hey we just put him on the hot hand we may see a switch defensively weake 10 and three on the season Miami 11 and two both winning their first two conference games Carr laid in the shot clock Reed grabs it another chance for the deakes to take the lead inside of 2 minutes we go in our first overtime Carr over Joseph batted out Reed Miller threepointer poopy Miller for Applause wake wake for size and offensive rebounding starting to pay dividends 25 points in the game for Kevin poopy Miller

takes you were leading the way our way and we couldnt be prouder University of Miami home of the Applause future Wake Forest up 8178 in overtime as we take a look at our player of the game brought to you by Progressive Insurance save when you bundle Auto home or motorcycle insurance visit progressivecom and this again its just recycle possessions on the uh you get scattered and omir tried to make a big play here but ruy Miller got a great look at it knocked down to three huge Applause play Miller has made all his threepoint attempts of the game none bigger and that one just a moment ago is our Progressive player of the game bopy Miller tying his career high had a game earlier this season when hes score 25 against talson he has matched that with his effort this afternoon fourth time hes been over 20 points on the season and really consistent every game this year are in double figures except for one pack too strong omir tried to follow he hit the deck in a foul is called that was almost a pass to omir I mean you know I dont know how much of a chance that one had going in but omir right in front of the rim so that was Carr in the leaping contest with omir car got the foul for Music Applause Wake its now three for three from the line for nor shadir in 17 points couple of brave souls wearing their Miami gear into the building some orange and green smattered behind that Miami bench so a couple of big free throws aere onepoint game well look at benley Joseph making trying to make life miserable look out that ball was headed to our broadcast position court side luckily somebody in the front row intercepted the pass timeout taken theyre going to look and see yeah under two minutes can take a looking in regulation and overtime time yep so youve got Reed for wake omir and green for Miami that is Teddy Valentine right on top of it saying wake ball and that was uh and that and really what Bley Josephs pressure is what made that pass a little dicey what a great reaction from nor Shadow Mir he thinks its off of Reed and its tough to see if the if Reeds hand you cant see the ball is you cant see if theres any contact at that point the best look Teddy Valentine has the best look at it you must have indisputable video evidence to overturn the call which on the court was signaled in the favor of Wake Forest I dont know Mike now from now from that angle it looks like oms hand was the last one to touch Applause Music it so Ted Valentine and John Gaffney are over at the scorers table taking the look at the review that last look that we that we had looked like it was the best one to see some fantastic replays from our production crew what an afternoon of college basketball CW Courtside yeah they had enough evidence to overturn the call so it will be off of Reed so read the last to touch it its Miami ball and Miami Trails by one Mike 107 to go and not a lot of uh consternation on wakes side Applause so Matthew Cleveland had a chance to win it in regulation with about a 17 18footer this is Kean George not enough on it kind of a tired shot right there by the Freshman although he does have 21 points and six of 12 from the floor yeah but overtime heavy minutes for him 23 for hildr 25 for Miller he leads all scorers with his 25 Solus with the basketball shot clock to seven for Miller hildr determined Drive and the kick Salis right before the end of the clock Salis with a three and 18 points time Applause out Bo what a massive play what a great find by hildr unselfish kicking it out great spot up UPG great Applause finish so take a look at this Mike last year for Wake Forest which won 19 games 13 games decided by three points or less tied into overtime and leading by four after the Salis 3 yeah and uh and that that really decided their NCAA fate last year um and now for Miami you got to get youve got to get something quick Music hitting and your next foul is going to put Miami is going to or wake is going to be in the double bonus going forward Music so so we were tied at 73 at the end of regulation wake had a sevenpoint halftime lead here we are 238 seconds to go in OT Steve Forbes and the deakes trying to stay perfect on their home floor move to 9 and0 but still plenty of time in this one and up by four Miami one time out wake forus one time out for Salis Mike that was his second three of The Game 12 made threes Miami pushing up or wait pushing up the floor a little bit takes try to take a little time off the clock 10 of 20 on threepointers for Miami in the game this is pack stop and start got the shot away omir follows and lays it in and a timeout Miami 20 points for Amir just an absolute monster on the glass so thats five games in a row Mike 20 points or more for nor shadow here yeah pretty quick 13 seconds left on the clock so I say just he has he has owned the front of the offensive Music glass you dont have the numbers of just 12 offensive rebounds hes got to have three quarters of them 24 Second Chance points for Miami 13 total rebounds omir in a double double Millers the leading score on the other side of the Ledger with 25 I mean what a game full tilt Full Throttle excitement from Miami and Way Forest both of these teams coming to play this afternoon on the CW all Miller 82 hildr 84 Solace 80 so Joseph has to commit the foul in the back court thats his fourth and the thing you know the thing that Miller has hes so fast its virtually impossible to keep him from receiving the ball Millers been to the line four times in the game and made two of them double bonus now so you dont have that pressure of the one and one at the line two shot Applause so thats the threepoint Applause lead an enormous free throw Applause Miller new career high as well for him thats the fourpoint lead just over 12 seconds to go Miami races up with Joseph hoist of three misses Reed the rebound gives it to hildr the clock Runs Out in overtime Wake Forest wins it 86 82 over Miami
