Music about ready to go from mamish Pavilion post and Dongo the two we highlighted to jump and its Georgia Tech to control its Nathan George the Freshman one of three international players in this starting lineup hes from Canada mantoman defense kaasi Reeves hoists up a three the rebound comes to Jaden Zachary starting lineups for Boston College claudell Harris was Charleston Southerns leading scorer last year he was the Lone transfer portal Edition and then Devin mlon coming off a season High 15 points had seven offensive rebounds against wake the other day mlon lines up a three and hits for Georgia Tech Miles Kelly their leading score theyre hoping he broke out of a shooting slump with a 20point game Wednesday at Florida State Reeves the Florida transfer and eonia danana down low getting the start at Center and he puts it in there off the offensive uh glass Georgia Tech is a very good offensive rebounding team and thats what danana does theyre not going to run plays for him hes going to rebound block shots and play defense theres Zachary down low and its knocked out of bounds it goes to Georgia Tech David statamire you know him well former NBA Rookie of the Year spent more than a decade in the league first year as the head coach at Georgia Tech spent the last two as an assistant for the Boston Music Applause Celtics Dongo has the size advantage on Zachary picked up as dribble they go right back to Dongo wants to back him in and hes fouled by Applause Zachary Dan Earl Grant was telling us hes got a lot of friends and family and attendance he played his college ball not far from here at Georgia College well he now he told us that before the game but right now thats not what its on his mind at all his guys have lost two close games in the ACC and this is an opportunity that they really need to take advantage of Baseline Drive George beats post to the basket George is a guy thats not a great outside shooter and he really needs to take advantage of his ability to drive the ball to the basket entry pass to post hes dangerous as a score and a passer that time he gets his first bucket you see Dan is matched up with him and I think if youre Georgia Tech thats okay I dont think you want qu Quinton post hurting you close to the basket like to have a little more pressure on him but if hes going to shoot facing jumpers thats what you want long three by Miles Kelly looks like hes coming out of that season long shooting slump and it couldnt come at a better time neither one of these teams particularly a good threepoint shooting team statistically but they both feel like they have guys who can make that shot Kelly only 24 from three he was at 35 a year ago Applause Cornell Harris knocks it down averaging almost 15 a game and Harris he he can score from anywhere but hes got a really good pullup jump shot particularly in the midrange Dongo soft touch rebound to post maybe he saw post you he just got to shoot the ball if the guy blocks it he blocks it post from the outside where hes a 48 threepoint shooter its not fair sometimes wow and I I think if youre danana you know he didnt give him a lot of room and he got his hand up but got to put a little more pressure on him than that danana gets the drop off it doesnt go hes starting today after not playing in the last three games well hes starting today so he can match up defensively against post M Lockton his second three deposit slip wow and this is a guy whos shooting 29 from out there on the season so you take him any way you can get him had the season High 15 against Wake

season at Clemson Fon Reed has been a game changer since being eligible for Wake Forest and the interesting thing about all these guys is they do it a different way you know Bott your traditional back to the basket guy Lyn kid sort of in the same mold DJ Burns I dont know what mold he is in and Nord Chad oir just power even though hes not a tall guy and Quinton post accs most improved player last year my goodness hes better this year now all the talk around basketball hey were moving away from the big man the old school Center is extinct its a dinosaur well you know geneticists they found a way to bring back the willly mammoth if we can do that we can bring back the old school post guy well and Dongo is one of those guys hes not a threepoint shooter hes a back to the basket guy and so I wouldnt call him a woolly mammoth but hes more old style old school than post there is Dongo now Kyle Sturdivant hes the only hold over from that georia Tech team that won the ACC Championship a few years ago Tango posting up mton good defense and Dono showing off the Baseline fade Applause I think thats pretty good defense by mcglockton you want to force him to shoot that Baseline fade BC is hit all five of its shots and we get a foul away from the basket its on Dongo his first and thats why danana started the game because they didnt want the inexperienced Dongo to get in quick foul trouble against Quinton post but here this is the first time theyve really tried hard to post up post and hes got the Freshman on him and he does hes so active in there they do a great job getting him the ball at the moment that hes open and thats why that foul was committed first Miss for BC its Donald hand now what Georgia Tech wants to do defensively is to clog things up make it a little chaotic for Quinton Music post Debo Coleman from the outside really good sign for Georgia Tech that the three is going down Coleman an outstanding threepoint Music shooter 36 this year he was one of the more accurate threepoint Shooters last year as well post thats too easy I thought I didnt think they were going to find him but Harris came off the screen that was very good patience on the part of both Harris and Applause post Kelly weaving through the defense Music Jango puts it on the floor got mlocked in the air and the green horn showing some veteran moves what a you know we Fade Away jumper from the corner drive to the basket and a pullup theres Jaz Kelly not a lot of resistance at The Rim he missed and the rebound to Georgia Tech he expected more thats why he missed Georgia Tech trying to push it up so far BCs done a nice job getting back sturdivan drops it off and T on CL from the Baseline nice job by Georgia Tech they just spread the court to create those driving Lanes Boston College has to do a better job staying in front of their men they get it inside the post what a pass what a pass Claude doubled it left mcloon open right if Claud was going to double he needed to go double he didnt so much double as turn his head and lose his man cant do that with post excellent pass Georgia Tech has made its last four from the field thats an airball from Kelly it will stay with the yellow jackets quite a pace early on to this one Boston College is a team that averages 78 points a game Georgia Tech not quite so many its 71 and this is the best offensive BC team weve seen since probably you know the days when they had Jerome Robinson and Kai Bowman I agree there has been some lean times at BC but and you know they got it straightened away when Quinton post came back last year everybody criticized well this is a bad BC team but post missed the early part of the Season then once he got back and Earl Grant was able to integrate him into what they were doing BC was pretty good and they won nine League games last year 9 and 11 in conference play as third of them comes up short and those nine wins in League Play the most BC has had in conference play since 2011 and blocked by reevs kapari lost it gets it back no whistle Here Comes Kelly thats really good transition defense by a league b Kellys three doesnt go and we get a foul down Applause low now you notice without Quinton Post in the game BC doesnt really try as hard to get the ball inside that three in transition by Kelly theyre okay with that you know hes not a very good threepoint shooter only 22 on the year but when you get an opportunity like that in transition without your big post guy literally your post guy he makes the uh play on words work yes Kari trying to set the screen on Kelly sturdivan out to Coleman contested and the rebound pulled down by League Bay Mason Madson into the game straight from Woodstock 1969 well he is straight out of the 70s theres no question about that Zachary that rims out his threepoint shooting has fallen off since his freshman year Reeves trapped boy he needed to maintain the Trap did Kelly he backed Music off kars three not there batted around stur ofan gets it back freshh 20 lines it up and hits Applause again Georgia Tech theyre a very good offensive rebounding team and theyve converted a couple now they came in as the best offensive rebounding team in the ACC as Kelly swoops in well and on one hand thats a good thing but on the other hand that means youre missing a lot of shots Reeves it rattles in and that is 43 on 10 attempts for Georgia Tech they came in shooting 28 from three as a team they did a nice job did the yellow jackets driving the ball to the basket so BC pressed the defense back a little bit and that has created some open threepoint opportunities Kelly looks to answer now Im not thats early in the shock clock its not in transition and Kellys a 22 3point shooter BC can get a better shot stur of it now its danana forced that one up battle for the board another offensive rebound by Georgia Tech its its knocked out of Applause bounds media timeout 1016 to go in a frantic first half here in Applause

The Music Ark W hes convinced everybody he can shoot it now now you got to go out and make him put it on the floor hes changing the scouting report as we go and now Dongo draws the foul on mlon well

at garbage time and impressed Damon stanmire and has been at the helm ever since and hes taking over that point guard roll Harris gets tied up calls a timeout looks like we got a timeout see he didnt

addition of Joe Gerard claudell Harris again hes got nine and hes four for four from the field its really great for your offense when you need a basket if you have a guy you can go get you one thats why they brought him in and and this time theyll get a foul its going to be on Music Harris wait thats a heck of a shot right there off balance Zachary out there to defend George Kelly ran out of real estate but Kelly and Harris are having a very interesting battle and theyre discussing the battle that theyre having as well good natured Id assume I I absolutely post Catch and Release its tapped around Kellys got it ahead to Reeves spots up and hits thats really a nice job to take advantage and push that ball up quickly Al leag Bay its tapped back to Harris you know Im not sure that you want your guy whos one for 16 from out there shooting that one that early in the shot clock this is where the ball has to go post backing Dongo George to help and the rebound to Applause Dongo Kelly open lines it up Miss fires I think Kellys always open but hes been hot so that was a good shot in transition Zachary back to post the trailer looked good when he shot it out of bounds to Georgia Tech and that was also a good shot you know if you can get Quinton post that shot with no defense on him you want that one the one one thing I think the Georgia Tech has accomplished post has played well but he has had to work hard on both ends of the court and thats what Damon statam told us he said hey we want him to go to the bench we want him to be thirsty we want him to be Laughter tired you want to be thirsty you just dont want to be hungry thats right Music Stan against Kelly Kelly open three good Miles Kelly hits there you have it again the point guard takes the ball into the lane draws the

College back to Anish and Dan guys Quint and pose with a dozen points both teams shooting lights out this has been an enjoyable first half of basketball the game is always entertaining when the ball goes in the basket and it has for both of these teams now interestingly enough post mton and Harris have scored all but four of the Boston College points and you brought it up earlier when Harris and post were out of the game Georgia Tech was able to on a run Dongo off the feed from sturen and the Georgia Tech guards are slicing this BC defense well they sure are they just didnt handle the screen very well BC playing through post theres the double thats the first shot hes really forced up and it comes to the yellow jackets he committed himself way too early to the Baseline Reeves oh Music seven of 15 from three for Georgia Tech Reeves has 11 and a traveling call on mlon and Georgia Tech is shooting the ball very well one of the reasons is theyre getting good shots miscommunication there on the screen great job to find Dongo and this is in transition you can get open threes in transition and Georgia Tech has knocked them down so far this afternoon and this is a nice little spurt by the yellow jackers its a Georgia Tech team that so far has relied a lot on getting Second Chances offensive rebounds throughout the season you go to the Duke game that was one of the games where they shot it well they shoot it well theyre hard to beat Here Comes Kelly post right back to Chaz Kelly well he wanted Kelly to be moving and Kelly wasnt great ball movement mlock did miss the flush that was a great pass Stans got five assists uhoh this might be number six it is daro for three his second three of the Season what hasnt he done today you know we said before the game started that it was post who was the threepoint shooter not in Don not Dongo but boy he had all day to shoot that one because again the defense collapses post went after the driver 15 points for Dongo although Im going to tell you if Im Boston College I dont mind Dongo shooting a three I mind him making it hes putting stuff on the next scouting report that was not on the previous one there comes Harris the turnaround and the rebound Sturdivant little too much oneonone play that ball goes in its fine but if doesnt everybodys standing around St from the outside in the lead mushrooms to 13 now sturdivan is a 30 threepoint Applause shooter post is open mlon offensive rebound Zachary not there its an 110 run for Georgia Applause Tech clock running down s of it lets it Fly front rim and thats how the first half ends a season High 51 first half points the last 13 shots and big difference for Georgia Tech in the opening 20 minutes nine threepointers made on 18 attempts they came in as a poor threepoint shooting team Zachary the drive and dish but Glock and knock down a couple of Threes in the opening half a league Bay off the Post Feed had a good look and the rebound to eaner danana who got the start today that was a good look but I think it would have been a good look for you too Alik Bay is now theres another three but Alik Bay is now 1 for 18 shooting threes maybe he should put that one in his back pocket meanwhile Reeves is four of five from Beyond The Arc was three of seven from three on Wednesday against Florida State they just pushed the ball up quickly that time here comes Harris the drive and Dish Al League Bay with the shot clock in single digits got his man in the air and draws the foul and thats a better play by a league day theyre playing off of him because he is not a good shooter so he takes the ball close to the basket and if theyre not playing you on the outside theres a good way to draw the defensive attention and thats to take the ball to the basket draws two Defenders and draws the foul they get the Freshman Nate George with his first Applause foul a league Bay a sophomore from Minneapolis where he played on the same high school team that fielded jayen Suggs and Chad hbr H so you telling me he wasnt the primary scorer you get to a uh big time division one program in the ACC and you say I was the third best player at my high school team they look at you what context important a Boston College is not noted as an outstanding defensive team but they really have to turn up the defensive pressure here size Advantage here for Dongo against Zachary he throws it away now and see Dongo he hasnt made very many bad decisions today but thats one of them you got Zachary on you take it to the basket and shoot it that was not a happy expression on Damon stms face he said it all without Applause words Zachary can post up down low backing down Kelly theres the double Al League Bay that time passed on the three drives to the rim and thats a good play by a league Bay theyre going to give him some room and if he can get going hes a very talented a very athletic guy he ought to be able to get the ball to the goal George falling away and the long rebound tipped into the air by post Boston College would be wise to push it up a little bit too why do you say that I think you get easier shots when you play in transition down low mton over

against post he just didnt have enough Applause time Harris post and mcglockton have been the offense for Applause BC heres Harris foul a threepoint shot and a chance for Applause Music Applause four the only reason he got that chance was the fact that Quinton post tracked down a really bad pass and got him rolling again and Reeves you know just stay away hes behind thats the last thing you want to do is to run into that guy shooting the three and if you are going to run into him you need to run into him hard enough that he doesnt make Music it just a few minutes ago it was a 16point lead for Georgia Tech and Harris with the four fourpoint play has now trimmed the deficit to four you could just see Boston College increase its intensity now and now the yellow jackets have to match Applause Music that big closing run for Georgia Tech to end the first half BC hot to begin the second half and a foul away from the ball as Dongo had mlocked it were battling for position its really a nice job by Dongo to battle for that position if hes not aggressive in there mlon is not forced to fou it second foul on Devin mcglockton red shirt sophomore and a Georgia native breather for post Armani Mighty comes in and with post out they take Dongo out too so Claude comes in for him Claude has the ball now leading rebounder in the socon at Western Carolina last year stur it gets inside teardrop rattles in and gets inside is exactly the correct correct term andan hes done a very nice job of that all afternoon almost at will well thats how you stop a run you dont do it by col and time out youre doing it by you do it by scoring now lets see if they can hold BC Zachary to a league Bay he try another three and that time he hits his second made three of the season I guess you just keep shooting him it was 1 for 16 from three entering play now one for three this afternoon Coleman no good rebound mlon and thats a quick shot you got to get some ball movement BC can tie with a three Music Applause this is a point where you clear for Applause Music Harris Harris for the tie left it Music short Sturdivant hits the turbo now Claude and we get a foul BC continues to trim the deficit

someone special Boston College has come storming back a 152 run and theyre doing a great job scoring close to the basket nice passing inside mlon really having a good game then Harris knocking down the three one of the big items and here fighting makes his second three of the year so that helped but Boston College has scored nine of its points in this half as a result of three Georgia Tech turnovers so we talked about the fact that the Eagles needed to turn up the defensive pressure they have and remember Georgia Tech has already used a couple of timeouts in this half Damon styom only has one left had a close game those timeouts become of importance down the stretch and Dongo is coming back in the game now but he has not taken a shot in the second half 157 rebounds in the first half but hes been a noshow so far here in the second Dongo on the bench post on the bench gari the UMass transfer able to draw the foul and that looked more like the Boston College offense in the first half the floor is spread and gapar he just gets by Madson who reaches FS Music him you know Matson I think was surprised that gapar put the ball down and went by him Music Applause 11 by dong go back into the game for Georgia Tech and no Quinton Poe still on the bench for Music BC both free throws good for kapari whos a 46 free throw shooter so that helps the cause was just six of 13 on the season entering the game Zachary Baseline of League Bay crowd wanted to travel he never had the control of the ball you have to control it to walk with it a league Bay another three doesnt go well he shoots 16 from out there for or 6 out there for a reason Here Comes Coleman against Madson and Debo Coleman draws the foul thats three on Mason Matson so that is twice now that Georgia Tech has spread the court and gotten a foul on Madson by simply attacking him off the dribble Matson the Cincinnati transfer brought in last year to boost outside shooting young man who was never really healthy all of last year he battles an autoimmune disease and once that was diagnosed was able to take medication his energy level was back up and all the pain that he had in other areas went away and he was able to grow his hair now the look is something else thats an all ACC look its an all ACC look from 1972 and Bill Walton would be Music Applause proud Applause Music so now with post back in lets see if Boston College elects to run what theyre doing through him hes matched up against Dongo Zachary puts it up toward the rim and he knew he had post but he got the bounce I think it was a good decision to put it up there softly rather than try the law cuz if he missed post was in perfect position Kellys been quiet here comes Dongo driveing dish kapari Baseline attacking the rim for two well now they scored but I think thats a play that in Dongo has to shoot the ball hes 3 feet from the Applause basket Harris Maneuvers around the trees you know when Harris hunts his shot hes normally going to find it hes got 15 Kelly had a big second half against Florida State on Wednesday puts it on the floor uses the window thats a tough matchup for Harris hes so important offens iiv L you got to be careful sometimes on the defensive end and Kelly took Music advantage post setting the screen for Harris plenty of time to shoot Zachary Attack Mode here comes sturdivan inside to Dongo over post who may have gotten a piece see that was not a good shot M locked in on the run out and the three good put that one in the Playbook Donald hand Jr the red shirt freshman Earl Grant telling us before the game they got a couple of guys who he feels could erupt he said clell Harris you know is one of them Donald hand was the other name he mentioned dad was a terrific scorer at Virginia Dongo against post and a

today Big Time Music game Mason Madson is a man of allall Seasons he is a blogger video blogger and hes got a YouTube channel where he Chronicles his journey and the journey of his team you can follow along how about that mustache now that takes wax to curl it up Raleigh fingers like you need a little wax to do that thats some Music Music look had a nice job finding Miles Kelly yeah Dongo got the switch with the screen and then missed the Baseline jumper he was making all of those in the first half he had made his last seven shots coming into the second half they D up on post right away mlon didnt know that he was open and so had he cut to the basket they had a layup shot clock down to six and Harris ties the game with the corner three and you I mean if youre Georgia Tech thats got to be a big concern because he just showed you he can get a shot against really tough defense BC trailed by as many as 16 early in this half Coleman post flies in for the board W they were so good shooting the three in the first half just hasnt been there in the second theyve only made one in the second Applause half post against Dongo Stripped Away he wanted a foul Here Comes Coleman ahead to stur of it gets it back and Coleman gives Georgia Tech the lead 6563 well post might have had a case right there but the Eagles sort of stopped and were complaining about the no call and that allowed Georgia Tech to get out and go post not there another rebound by stur ofan and he throws it Applause away well post has the ball inside and Coleman stripped it away and you saw like three or four of the BC guys just stood there and watched waiting for the foul call and that allowed Georgia Tech to get an easy one and when youre struggling offensively as the jackets have been in this half youll take all the easy ones you can get Boston College can take the lead with a three they last LED at 2119 with 1106 to go in the opening Applause half down low to post over Dongo offensive rebound mlon and once again were tied and thats a product of everybody collapsing on post and mlon takes advantage nobody blocks him out George trying to split the D almost lost it Dongo is fouled all the down Music low George now talking to the officials he thinks he was Music F this is a nice job by George to get the ball through the pressure to keep his composure to make that pass he was upset but that did he didnt interrupt us talk to the referees until he was Music finished sixth team foul on BC it was on Chaz Kelly his first and Dongo still looking for his first point here in the second half at 15 and seven at the break hes comes in as a 64 threepoint shooter and as active as he has become inside hes going to get there a lot he needs to be better than 64 one out of two and thats his first point since halftime Applause Music BC can take the lead post to mlon and the Eagles lead for the first time since the 1106 Mark of the first half can understand why Georgia Tech was concerned about posts ability to pass the ball but a great cut Again by mcglockton posed with five assists the game against St Johns he at nine heres Coleman battle for the board knocked out of bounds last touch Applause kapari well again Boston College they like to run stuff through post and this time Debo Coleman hes double teaming post out on the top of the key and suddenly realizes he doesnt need to and by the time he recovers his man mcglockton is already open under the basket Music BC 0 and2 in conference play looking for its first League win Kelly the step back knocks it down BC has lost two of those those two games you mentioned theyre both close affairs George puts it on the floor Reeves from the outside cant get the bounce and a whistle M they got mlock third foul on M glockton and Georgia Tech in the bonus itll be a one and one mlon is under the basket and hes saying hes blocking out but thats one way its one term used to describe it and he just pushed him out of the way now interestingly enough youll notice there that Georgia has only committed three team fouls so that means the yellow jackets ought to have the opportunity to get some free throws while Boston College is going to be a couple more fouls before they go to the line question is can the jackets take Music Applause advantage Dango misses the front end Bo the front end and thats a thats thats a big one now if youre Georgia Tech you have to dig in here defensively as Boston College is suddenly in an offensive Rhythm Kelly from up top hits from the outside seven points for Chaz Kelly Bo gari wasnt even looking and when youre all when youre down the court all alone you need to be looking for the basketball a Sixpoint lead for BC Kari against the league Bay lost it Dongo missed the bnny rebound post he expected more pressure than he got George all over Music Kelly Chaz Kelly into the painted area nine for Chaz Kelly and then then Dongo is limping up the court yeah Dongo almost hunched over remember Georgia Tech only has one Applause timeout George over post and Dongo limping and all gets the tip in and he is hobbling back the other way you always hobble a little bit more on defense up your BC do you go right to posto I think you go right to post because thats who you go to theres the quick double and Coleman committed that foul on purpose to get the stoppage to give Georgia Tech a chance to sub BC

greatness is what we do the ACC accomplished greatness did you know the same video API that does this can also do this and even this build powerful experiences with the Vonage video Music API by Dongo who has emerged as a freshman St are for Georgia Tech hobbling down court before the last whistle we can see what happens it looks like that right ankle yeah just turned it and sometimes that can be unbelievably painful and you can see Dongo react and Quinton post there I mean those guys have had a great battle today and Dongo Im telling you he limped up the court and what did he do he tipped in a missed shot Dongo is on the bench taon claw the Western Carolina transfer in at the five for Georgia Tech hes flank by sturdivan Kelly Reeves and Coleman not a lot of size against post right at the moment DC has a rais to 16point deficit on the strength of a 70 from the field second half stur it the other way numbers Reeves up up ahead for two and Applause Music one Georgia Tech has done a nice job at times getting out in transition and that is a great pass by stur sturdivan you know it really takes some ability when youre in the open court like that to know exactly when to deliver the ball and he delivered that at the perfect time Dan Sturman tonight flirting with a triple double eight point nine rebounds and now eight assists hes done a really nice job and you know if he gets the triple double will be one of the quietest triple doubles you ever saw and the guard play especially in the assisted turnover department has been Sublime for most of this game for Georgia Tech Claude tried to knock it away theyll get him with a reach in and that is his first foul Claud is trying to deny it but he is laying all over Quinton Applause post that would have been pass interference in the NFL its a foul here spot foul in college or spot foul in the NFL 15 yards in college Here Comes Kelly lobed down low to post turns finishes he does such a great job catching it in traffic and he knows what to do with it and for post his first two points of the second Music half post has done his damage passing the ball in the second Applause half miles Kelly makes it a threepoint game he did a nice job recognizing a mismatch and I think Kellys a guy that thats got to be a little bit more aggressive down the stretch here for the Jack hes the leading score post Kelly pokes it away and now he is fouled by Miles Kelly whos not happy with the call and stared down Shan hall for a Music moment did a nice job to poke it away but post clearly has the inside track on this one knocks it away and now post hes turning around to recover and Kellys got to go through him to get to the ball fact that sturdivan tried to go through him as well and he gets the foul call even though post is trying to call Music timeout that was the sixth team foul on Georgia Tech so BC now in the bonus Applause Harris hat knocked away Reeves up ahead to Kelly twohanded Applause slam amidst the chaos loose ball Reeves of it blocked and a foul Anish there was a lot of stuff going on there it started with Miles Kelly poking it away and then chaos along the sideline how I dont I dont know how everybody stayed in bounds everybody just kept playing now the free throws have not been falling in this second half for Georgia Tech now five for nine theyve hurt them they missed a couple front ends of the one and Music one 999 First St of it nine points nine rebounds nine Applause assists Zachary the tip by post Georgia Tech can take the lead Here Comes Reeves Coleman gives it up claw for the lead and a chance at a threepoint Applause Music Applause Music play again they make a defensive play and get out and go Coleman he get does a nice job getting himself under control to find an open teammate and Claud his role has changed here since the start of the season but he is a very valuable guy that you can bring Off the Bench and remember theyre doing all this without Dongo Claude was the one they brought in hes a veteran hes played a lot of ball started at Morehead State was an allconference player in the socon at Western Carolina led the league in rebounding last year and a physical back to the basket type only a 53 free throw shooter though so I feel you can understand why I want to make sure his vision was clear Music clear and he completes the threepoint play eight unanswered for Georgia Tech after BC had taken the Applause lead Harris to tie yes and it quiets the crowd with BC theyve got two guys who can really put points on the board in post and Harris and you figure those two guys are going to be heavily involved in the offense for the rest of the Music way let go Applause go Zachary kicks to the corner mclock a three his third Applause triple 8279 BC thats M locktons third threepoint basket today and well get a foul away from the ball and takes us to our media timeout good finish Brewing in Atlanta BC up by three with 302 Music left take a look at Applause this its the

plays makes the game easier for everyone got the Beatles going there pregame Im sure Big 12 opener coming your way next after our finish in Atlanta Anish Music officials at the replay monitor theyve been there for a while trying to determine if the last foul on Claud L Harris was a common foul or something more well in the middle of your screen Harris elbows Kelly and then Harris gets his arm around his neck now Kelly is selling this for all its worth but you get that arm wrapped around the neck and thats what the officials are looking at and you know could also be something as as e little as that bump because the definition of a flagrant foul is contact that is excessive and or unnecessary and you can make the argument even if that wasnt excessive it was unnecessary but this is going to be a big call here theyve been at this a long time officials today Roger aers Shan Hall Jenna Reno and right now Roger aers and Shan Hall at the monitor theyve been there again for quite some time in the beginning it looked like it would be a quick review it has not been no it has not been now remember we pointed out earlier in the game that Harris and Kelly have really gone after one another in the right hand portion of screen theres the elbow and Kelly really is trying to sell it and then Harris hes got the right arm up and hes got the left arm wrapped around his neck and then Kelly he clamps down on that arm so maybe theyre looking at a hook and hold by Kelly you know good Heavens theres all kinds of things going on that theyre taking a look at yeah well get the word as soon as they sort through the Carnage and sorting through the Carnage is a good description of what happened but Harris and Kelly have been after one another the entire game now remember if they do call a flagrant foul in this situation and you know weve seen where it might go either way the team that is fouled gets two shots and the Music ball what we have the call we have at the moment is a common foul against Music Harris Georgia Tech looking to go to two and one in conference play Boston College lost a couple of Heartbreakers in League Play at a Wake Forest in NC State and BC trying for its first League win of the season and theyre going to call the coaches to call coaches over theyll give them the explanation first Roger aers directing Music traffic hows your lip reading Dan well Im the body language of Damon stmy is not good taking the foul off of Boston College number one going flagrant one hook and clamp on 13 white okay so we get the explanation they take the foul off of Claude El Harris and thats what you said it wasnt the arm that went around the neck it was the clamp by Miles Kelly to try to draw that foul and now the extensive review you nailed it it was to look to see if Kelly had done something wrong and they get the flagrant on Kelly by they got him he he hooked his arm around and pulled it down so thats the classic definition of a hook and hold but boy there was a lot going on Music there now because its a flagrant foul the person who is fouled goes to the line to shoot so Harris is going to get two and Boston is going to get the ball huge turn of events BC with a threepoint lead Harris today 21 points and that big 29point game against Lehi he gets one out of two and they get the ballc gets the ball boy that is a that is a big turnaround in this game but I think I think that was the right call you know we didnt see it until that very last replay but in that last replay you could clearly see Kelly hook his arm around Harris and pull it Applause down now Georgia Tech needs to stop desperately and Dongo is back in for the yellow jackets and we got a foul right in front of us oh Damon St needs to careful Damon Stout starting to get a little frustrated its on Dongo his second well he thought Damon STM Damon stms just gotten the technical they thought that Harris walked on this play and maybe he did but it was might be because he got pushed and Damon STM came all the way down so now he has picked up a technical foul so its gone from bad to worse here for Georgia te it was a threepoint game a flagrant foul against Georgia Tech they BC two shots in possession Harris hit one out of two and then on the ensuing possession Harris fouled technical foul on Damon stoutmire so that satisfies the technical and now one and one for Harris and Harris is going back to line and heres stmy and Roger haris called the technical foul from across the court Im not sure that jeno even realized that Harris was standing next to her until after the technical had been called wow what a huge swing and its now a threep possession game with 250 to go 12 seconds ago this was a threepoint game Music Applause right geia Tech remember used two timeouts early in the half only one left well you need to go quickly but you dont need to panic here you got to get a good shot Kelly overpost it rims out offensive rebound to Reeds po defending Kelly he throw it down low Dongo over Zachary and Dongo to the line two shots coming thats a nice job by post to get close enough to Kelly to make that a tougher threepoint shot I dont have any problem with Kelly shooting that three hes a good threepoint shooter so post has his hand up but Zachary is hes trapped down inside theres very little he can do in there and again Dongo is only a 64 free throw shooter so thats not a bad foul and today just one of four from the free throw line 18 points eight rebounds for Dongo but in the second half three points one rebound and remember he was hobbling a little while back after landing the wrong way on his right ankle right but with that long review we had he had plenty of time to recover missed them both oh my thats falling apart down the stretch here for Georgia Applause Tech Harris driving and hes fouled trying to go for the dunk its on Dongo thats three and Harris is a young man with some intensity about him he sees the opportunity goes right past kapari and those are two pretty big guys in there hes trying to dunk it and Dongo and Reeves try to stop Applause him and its a 10 run for BC and most of the damage has come from the free throw line and its Harris from the free throw line now hes eaten from the stripe 26 points for Charleston Southerns leading score from a season ago and they brought him to Chestnut Hill think because he can get to the basket he can create his own shot Kelly the other way blocked by Applause post itll stay with Georgia Tech 157 to go eightpoint game now post doesnt chase people down to block shots but when youre taking the ball right at him and hes waiting for you he is an outstanding shot blocker really does a nice job avoiding contact in those situations stirred events will go to the free throw line I think they got Zachary they Music did third foul on Zachary and Stan one of the more reliable free throw shooters for Georgia Tech thats right a nice spin move and he was actually losing control of that ball on the way up it looked like in Zachary clearly got him on the arm so Georgia Tech has really struggled from the free throw line here in the second half 60 for the Music game you eight of 14 at the stripe in the second half you in that middle of that Boston College run Georgia Tech missed a couple of front ends of the one and one and that usually comes back to bite yet Stans got a double double 11 points 10 rebounds and he is one assist away from the sixth triple double in school history Al League Bays got to get it in he does Harris is trapped looking for help they get it across to Al League Bay and Zachary to break the press the alleyoop Le Bay misses offensive rebound Zachary and Earl Grant says sentle boy I mean Georgia Tech had an opportunity there they just couldnt get the rebound there were four white shirts close by a league Bay Baseline almost lost it mton a career game for him hes got 26 on 10 of 13 they wanted a foul on Zachary got to move the ball sturdivan had Kelly instead of turnover that ball just never came up you know sometimes you throw that bounce pass and the ball doesnt bounce and it didnt that time I think Kelly had a great opportunity for a Applause Music basket now BC trying to break this press last touch Georgia Tech itll stay with the Eagles 105 to go BC now for the fourth time in five games north of 80 points the one game they didnt get there last time out they scored 78 against wake this is a team that can score lets check in with Kevin Conor in the studio yeah and Anish the Hoops just keep on coming up next year on ESPN 2 its UCF and Kansas State the game is underway right now on ESPNU a Kate team coming off the win over Witchita State youll see it next here on ESPN 2 Anish after our finish in Atlanta Anish Rob Dan Bonner 105 to go in this one BC Dan trailed by 16 early in this second half they now have an eightpoint lead and things went arve for Georgia Tech right around the 3 minute mark it was a flagrant foul on Miles Kelly and and then a technical on Damon stoutmire well and to start it off though it was a foul on BC and the officials after a review took the foul away from Harris gave it to Kelly and you just saw in our picture there Prince El League Bay get up and Madson Mason Madson sit down and theyre doing that because they figur Georgia Tech is going to foul now and a league Bay is only a 64 free throw shooter and Madson you know its been a while since hes been in the game but he is 10 for 10 from the line this season and here you get a look each team with one timeout everybodys in the double bonus the possession arrow if it comes to that is Georgia Tech and if youre Georgia Tech you got to get scores and you have to get the ball back and youre down far enough now I think the only way youre going to get the ball back unless you get a steal right away you have to foul immediately and see in their two ACC losses 60 from the free throw line thats been the Achilles heel overall 76 from the stripe theyre an excellent free throw shooting team Madson looking for help gets it to mton almost stolen away Zachary into the front Court precious seconds tiing off they got it looks like theyre not going to foul no Applause now they turn it over and skying in is gabari 8983 well thats a big help but that took a lot of time two possession game less than 45 seconds to go now remember each team only has one timeout so the first thing you have to do is get it in bounds Matson able to clear down low mton puts it up it counts and the foul well they had a chance to foul a couple of times but nice job by Matson to step through the double team and find the open man Matson does a really nice job here theyre trying to foul him but he steps right through makes a lefthanded pass and mton has been so strong today that was a power dribble right there fourth foul on Dongo a careerhigh 28 points from a glockton even with the missed free throw stur ofan an assist away from a triple double Kelly is bumped along the Applause Baseline and theyll call an offensive foul well Kelly we we can see from our angle he wrapped his elbow around him four fouls on Kelly mlock and trapped up ahead to Madson final 20 seconds now Madson is fouled 10 for 10 at the free throw line entering play this season well Matson hes made all 10 of his free throws and thats what hes in the game for is to shoot the free throws and to show off that mustache again somewhere in Clint Michigan Jackie Moon Music Smiles I think thats five on Dongo Dongo fouled out Damon sodoms just trying to make Madson wait hes got 30 seconds to make the substitution he took all of them oh Dan we were talking before the the game Boston College almost beat a very good wake team on Tuesday night they came up short against a pretty good NC State team in overtime this is a team last year where so much of their season is misleading if you just look at their schedule and you look at the win loss total they were 9 and 11 in conference they did it without Quinton post for the first two months they had some bad losses in that stretch lost to main they were a much better team in League Play they were pretty good down the stretch in a real tough out down the stretch and they have what is maybe the hardest thing to attain in college basketball these days continuity on this roster were not quite done yet your point about last year was excellent by the end of the year they Bor no resemblance to the team that they were at the first of the year because they finally got post back and they were finally able to integrate him into what they were trying to do but you saw Dongo go to the the bench with 18 points remember he had 15 in the first half and Boston College yes theyve scored 93 points but I thought the thing that turned the game for him is they really picked up the defensive intensity when they went on that big 152 run at the start of the second half nine of those points that they scored were off turnovers and real Grant has to be very pleased with his teams effort I mean they really played hard how about this m glockton with 30 points I thought that ball was going to hit the Applause scoreboard that is some pass thatll count for Coleman thats just bookkeeping and Boston College gets its first win in conference play and now some fireworks
