here we go AJ the side with the ball in hand Kyle filipowski and Fen Reed jump Center and away we go deeps in the gold on their home court bopy Miller is the red shirt sophomore point guard the central Michigan transfer for head coach Steve Forbes Eon Reed couldnt catch off the pick and roll in an early weight turnover yeah turnovers are big you know the run out ones are the ones I think Steve Ford was most concerned about but first possession of the game you cant even make a a pass thats a tough start two Elite offensive teams and here is Duke going to work Mark Mitchell he has been hot the last dozen games the 69 sophomore backing down Andrew Carr and Pam hilr the rebound and that was the story of the first matchup Mike it was Mark Mitchell and Kyle filipowski 4419 combined a lot of that having to do with the foul trouble that eston Reed and Andrew Carr were in that game e Reed working against Philip pasy was calling for it here is K fourthe player second year at weight tough shot wont Applause go Jeremy roach the steady senior and move for McCain 40 from Deep 13 and a half points per game but cleared by Salis Salis the number number four scor in the ACC for a wake offense that is loaded these are the top two offenses in the ACC in shooting percentage thatas tough shot thats obviously the key match up here today hes one of the five best players in the ACC Hunter salz First Team all ACC in my opinion and he can make tough shots zaga transfer originally from Omaha having a great season here in Winston roach down the lane lays it in and Dukes on the board two minutes Music Applause in Ry Miller initiates the offense fourway course coming off the demolition of pit on Applause Tuesday all right d thanks very much and welcome to one of the best atmospheres you will see all weekend in college basketball the sold out Joel in Winston Salem North Carolina for Duke ranked eighth in the country against Wake Forest with Chris POA Mike Monaco with you a Duke team you just saw the starting lineup led by Kyle filipowski and Jeremy roach tied at the top of the ACC at 12 and three await team fourth in the league and leading 42 in the first 3 minutes and in search of the NCAA tournament a bucket from Philip howski the top scorer for Duke Chris well thats the big match up there epon Reed on Philip howski Reed would he ended up fouling out of that first matchup it really allowed he and art Andrew Carr fouled out allowed Mark Mitchell and filipowski to really have a field day at The Rim Reed the lob and it rolls down from his point guard boy Miller but its not just Reeds defense you know his ability to to clog up that paint defensively he gives you that vertical threat at The Rim they love throwing it up to him out of that pick and roll Bowski swirls out a three this atmosphere for just joining us has been bananas in the leadup to this heres booy Miller a central Michigan transfer with post entry to Reed who had a mismatch skipped it for Andrew Carr who couldnt connect from Deep you know Duke because they switch a lot can get into some funky matchups at times as Caleb Foster threw it away picked off by K two excellent offenses two of the very best in all the AC Reed feeling good about his shot hes only knocked down nine career threes in three seasons you in an environment like this as a player the first thing you got to keep telling yourself is to stay in character dont take shots that are out of character for you take a deep breath with this crowd activated Hunter Salis through a foul that is on the floor against Jem roach well we just getting started and you dont and you love the turnout to support a team that needs this game if they win this game there is no question they are in the NCA tournament to stay right on that Fringe well have more coming up from Joe lardy in a couple of moments e Reed tried to ripped down an offensive rebound and it does stay with the demon de soard says that theyre the first team out not just in the first four out first team out a win today you say theyre absolutely in but we live in a world where the analysis is strictly analytical for the sa tournament I I still think weight Force resume is good enough today and they are certainly good enough as a basketball team as theyre playing right now to be in but again if they if they win this game here today they they are in and I think into step Parker Frederickson got fouled on a jum shot and its number two on Jeremy roach the steady senior guard for number eight Duke Duke meanwhile you saw p as a three seed right now for Joe lardy 12 and3 in the ACCC 21 and5 overall and on the five game winning stre but theyre going to exit Jeremy roach from this game and talking about foul trouble in the first meeting on the weight for his side last Monday roach is out Tyrese Proctor still coming off the bench for Duke in his second game back from a concussion suffered in that game against the Demon Deacons so he controls things with McCain Philip palski Foster and Brian Young the veteran big Off the Bench as well here he is 15 in blue wrapping it around to KY Philipi C kicks for Buster knocks it down and and thats the problem when you play Duke if youre going to be aggressive in the ball screen to start The Possession it then puts you in scramble you had a two onone as Reed recovered and recovered nicely but then that ball starts spraying around and Duke has a lot of Shooters theyre the best threepoint shooting team in the ACC and top 15 in the country Hunter Sal is on a Baseline Drive if you dont know his name whats most important about him he he does a lot he can really score he can shoot a three with range he puts it on the floor he plays a lot longer than his 65 frin and you love on a game like this Mike when your best player which has to be your best player gets off to a great start Tyrese Proctor sticks a triple to answer saless bucket and its du by one 6 minutes in and Salis is exactly that for w for junior Gaga transfer originally from Omaha and the number four scorer in the ACC fredericksons a shooter and Ryan young bumps F Reed year two for John Shire 36 years young theyve won 16 of 18 they blasted Miami on Wednesday wheres Duke cab right now theyre playing their best basketball and I think it says a lot about the job that that John has done you know this team has improved steadily as the year has gone on theyve had some continuity issues and Tyrese Proctor in and out of that lineup but these freshmen are starting to play like sophomores Applause Frederickson misses from deep and this teams got better defensively this Duke team theres the Freshman McCain at 142 points per game lost the handle young went diving for it and a held ball keeps it at this end of the floor it was interesting both of these coaches said that we have to make the other play in the half court they are both so good in transition they have a really fast Advance they space Shooters you know so part of its getting backs stopping the ball building that wall and then matching up with Shooters but both coaches transition defense was huge today something John sh said to his pregame that he was stressing all week with his group these are both top four defenses perk Kon in the ACC theres Philip palski team has been under control recently got it back from practor battling with Matt Marsh a kick for foster on it a second triple and here is transition for way Salis without numbers off the hesitation was probing and stepped out on the Baseline and await for his turnover thats where Hunter Salis Cam hildr and boy Miller look out to me those guys all of them can rip it they can run they all push and they are looking to score I mean that is their first option they are so Dynamic downhill especially that guy went for 20 plus in the first meeting Philip pasy to the bench and sniper deari Monsanto into the game for w poris 30 and Music Applause goal heres McCain 40 from three and he sticks one coming off 8 threes last weekend against Florida State when he matched Zions freshman Duke scoring record with 35 he is always on balance its one of the reasons he he is shooting such a high percentage be it off the dribble or off the catch hes got a really strong lower body and hes always on balance he matched up with Cam HR who lost it and it belongs to do and that movement there from Tyrese Proctor off the ball sort of occupies and then you know youre too late Jared McCain like you said hes hes on such a haer I mean that game Florida state had unconscious Vibes to it its an illegal screen set by Ryan young you know its interesting when Wake Forest comes with deari Monsanto and Parker Frederickson off of their bench they become a much better shooting team than they are with their starting lineup those two guys thats what they want they want three they actually helps their spacing offensively theyre both on the floor right now and John sh told us just a little while ago its like Wake Forest has three different teams alive to Marsh and nearly another turnover does stay with the deeps with 1220 to go in the half youve seen the defense get better for Duke the last few Applause weeks HRI from the corner to key it in and here is Monsanto you got to know where he is and knock it down 41 from three last year 10th game back this year from a knee injury and he has got shot well and their last four games over three of 19 young triying to follow it up and he Coes a foul it goes against Monsanto well Monsanto is a guy who can shoot it so well and wake is a team who in this building where mind you theyre 140 this season they shoot it much different than they do away from here and its interesting cuz most teams play better shoot better at home the the the thing with rake is its much better like it is a stark difference we asked Steve Forbes about it yesterday at practice in in a typical Steve Forbes way I cant explain Im not smart enough to be able to explain he is nothing if not African hes one of the best he is one of the best people in the coaching fraternity he is the American dream he is proof that you can work your way up you can pay your dues hes been an assistant coach a junior college coach came here from East Tennessee he and he does it all with a smile hes as likable a personality as there is hes just a good guy hes the pride of smalltown Lone Tree Iowa two years ago the ACC coach of the year its an 80 Duke run booy Miller out the shot B dishes to M Mar really good breakdown of the defense and good to get Matthew Marsh a dunk he played his best game in a while in that game against pit the other day they need to he needs to give them something starter last year out of the lineup and the rotation for a lot of this year McCain probing offensive rebound young and he moved it but the shot clock might not a reset that appears to be the issue here so we will take a timeout and get that tended to when we come back got to love the penetration here from boopy middle little boop boop round the rim Matthew March get him a dunk the big fella feed him Jim got honored today at the Dome and Syracuse made good on that with standing Notre Dame coming back the pack celebrating the title team from 74 and a big game that follows this one right here on ESPN Carolina at Virginia two of the top three teams in the ACC Virginia is another one of those teams and again if I can slay the analytics game the net for a moment here like this is another one of those teams that has gotten significantly better now than they were early and there is so much emphasis now theres this outsized importance on what you do in November and December and those are nonconference games and Virginia you know obviously struggled early in the year they are a much better team they are a tournament team if you just watch that team play Wake for is just saw last Saturday and lost by two strong take from Tyrese proactor at his second bucket the sophomore from Australias coming off their bench John sh has said all year they have six starters and its kind of switched around for Proctor to not play in that Florida State game coming off the concussion coming off the bench again today there are ansers right back to the de thats the challenge for Duke is guarding the ball with bopy Miller and cam HED those guys want the paint they are not shooting a high volume of Threes you have got to be able to guard your yard keep both those guys in front couple downhill drivers for Wake corus duks hit three triples wake corus doesnt have any and Philip psky goes to the cup with the left hand thats the versatility get in the pressure that he puts on F Reed you know Fon Reed trying to play this game physically but without fouling this is a lot to ask when filipowski puts it on his hand puts it on the floor with that left hand especially and read the sevenfooter for three proving us Applause wrong 34 from Deep his first triple and the first for Wake Forest Duke by Applause three filipowski flash to the block goes up for two more and thats where Id love to see filipowski more is inside cuz hes going to draw a double I think John Shys looking you know they ran a set there looking to get him a little bit more catching it on the Block sometimes he can get himself into trouble doing too much on the perimeter re kicks it out for Dallas knocks it down you got to stay attached to him thats too much space for a guy who has played that well this season hes got n of the 19 Kowski stepping out this time no DS bre with it down two Millers been ping for wants a deep one so he can drive you and also knock down a couple threes well he he hasnt shot at well in their last eight hes only four of 19 again 19s not a lot of attempts in eight games he has come out aggressive today Caleb Foster with a response for Duke talked his pregame about the steadiness that Foster brings you mentioned Proctor again coming off the bench second game back from the concussion and Foster has been steady with a heat check for away heres McCain driving on Frederickson bottled up B Mitchell for the Stop Mark Mitchell arrives on the scene with his first point call that a bail out cut cuz that was well defended the initial thrust from McCain was well defended Parker Frederick you just give him a little bit of an angle as Fon Reed leaves the picture and a great cut along the Baseline by Mark Mitchell now Mitchells a guy did not get off to a great start this year but he got to Duke by being a certain player you know the player hes playing like Now activity versatility aggressive it was almost like somebody got to him before the season and convinced him he had to play a certain way to be a pro shoot a perimeter shot and I think it paralyzed him but hes back to being who he is its been so good 15 and eight for him over the last dozen theyre 11 and one in that time he kicked it out for a spinning McCain shot clock winding down on the Freshman moves it for foster got to get it up and he does it its a sha clock violation how good is this scene and the game to match threepoint spread lets give you a taste of boopy going to break here little boopy Miller Kevin boopy Miller is wet from Deep course he started to heat up shooting with the D I thought bopy had hit a bit of a wall but got back to himself in that pick game you have to remember its really only his second year of college I mean he only played four games last year the year before that hes hes at Central Michigan so he has transferred up and an adjustment but what a start here for him last year bone in his foot Ean Reed draws a foul on Kyle filipowski its his first as duke has roach and Young on the bench with two a piece its going to be a battle down low it was the first matchup and you know I think Duke coming in wanted to make it a little bit difficult harder for those post guys be it Reed or Carr to catch it on the post they wanted a front read the deeper he got and again Reed fouled out in just 15 minutes in the first meeting early last week between these teams he got it down low got deal on Mitchell playing in the post is about where you catch it in the angle you have you cannot get much deeper than that it was a really nice big to Big pass from Carr even though the spacing wasnt great leading him into that shot he comes out on the crockford ball screen and nowed to trip down the rim and posterized Andrew Carr he get saddled with the Applause foul really nice pass here and a good job carving his angle and look at that position two feet in the paint right in front of the rim and then this is Mark Mitchell I mean this is the mark Mitchell we did not see early in the year there was he was he was on his heels he is much more leaning forward much more back to be the aggressive attacker that got him to Duke you said it earlier first meeting he and Philip Aly were hug John sh said they were men Mitchell had 23 to match a careerhigh in that one and again the last dozen games for him hes been outstanding and Dukes record reflects that I think a big part of them playing their best basketball is him and how hes playing hes an ex factor and then the ascendants of Jared McCain those two guys playing the way theyre playing Has Lifted Duke McCain getting a breather right now and Jeremy roach is back out there with his two first half fouls hes got the assignment on Salis Miller Reed has Mitchell on him again and roach tipped it away Salis recovers shot clock inside of 10 Salis met by filipowski Miller a Baseline Drive and kick for Carr cant stick Music it rocker goes spinning heres Mitchell attacking again and no offensive foul on Mark Mitchell his first personal what a job by Andrew car anticipating this again a big part of this game for both teams is getting back setting your defense forcing the other to play in a half court nice job sliding over outside that restri Ed area and he is absolutely there in time really nice defensive play you mentioned defensive transition how would you assess it on both sides so far its been good yeah both teams have forced the other play in a half court you know neithers a good shot blocking team rep protection for for for both has not been great so theres been a lot at The Rim so far Salis created a little in the space and got it to go hes got a game high 11 and he is begging these fans to rise to their feet locked to 26 phip palowsky excellent passer moved it for Jaylen Blakes shot clock at eight filipowski on re kicks for Blakes to thr you wakes got to protect their basket its got to be gain protection you know and a nice job Walling up by Reed you get help collapsing and your force a pass out to the guy you want shooting it youll live with Jaylen Blakes taking that shot at your Steve Applause fors Kowski switched on to Miller robot but it rolled out and E Reed is as good as anyone at that tip out its amazing how many offensive boards he creates by that bat out car catch the feed from Applause salisi calling for it now sets the screen for Proctor so good in the pick and roll kapasi moves it extra pass now roach attacks proor offensive rebound roach Philip palowski and that one goes down for filipowski and hes got eight Duke has been much better offensive rebounding team in conference play than they were early in the year and a big part of that is their guards getting in there Jared McCain has been maniacal on the glass good job by Jeremy roach sneaking in there Miller fouled by Mitchell and thats two on Mark Mitchell as Applause well nice job you know bopy Miller and cam hriff are so good at shot B when they get into that paint they both play off at two feet and it was one of the things that John sh was talking to his guards about the play with those two guys starts when they pick up the ball in the lane you have got to keep your feet in that case nice job shot faking the CLK Mitchell as he came over tomorrow Elizabeth kentley and number eight Virginia Tech host North Carolina at two Eastern over on acc Network and the college game day crew tips off our coverage from blackburg at 1100 am on ESPN program record fifth sellout of the season for head coach Kenny Brooks talking about how good a guy Steve Forbes is earlier in the game theres nobody better than Kenny Brooks either now oh that guy I love these some Kenny Brooks cut from the same clock as Steve fors 28 all just outside of fortigo in this first half it has lived up to it Chris P Mike monar entire cre with you Foster from the corner knocks down a three again thats the danger Mike if if youre going to send two the ball and they had a nice trap on the ball handler but thats when Duke I mean they space so well and theyve got multiple Shooters 38 from three this year knocked down 13 last time out Wednesday in the demolition of Miami and Coral Gables re got a seal with a mismatch mov it back out for Miller shot fake on Shan Stewart car struggled with a shot from Deep Applause recently here slicks it back for filipowski boster wants another and a rebound on the weak side from Pam hildr HRI is playing through a rest in look like that might be on Miller instead theyre going to tag Tys proor with it after some contact on both sides first off pror threepoint Duke lead on the road Caleb Foster does doesnt hunt his shot a lot but hes been open because of this ball screen coverage from Wake this is second of the game its a good question man you know I think in this league its its life on the road for Duke and North Carolina man and its you do you these guys are comfortable playing in these environments they expect it and and the thing for you know when youre in the tournament already like win or lose this game today you are better for being in this game for for both teams but certainly you know theres more in The Line Tournament wise for for Wade just kind of how it is man this environment this is old school Wake Forest I mean this is vintage Wake Forest basketball this areena an attendance record at Lawrence Joel Veterans Memorial Coliseum its a mouthful by the way nearly 15000 here again first sell out here since 7 years ago and a team in Wake that is perfect at home trying to rubber stamp like d said an NCAA tournament resume against a Duke team tied for first with Carolina in the ACC and on an ACC best right now fivegame winning streak filipowski is double about passing out of the post to Proctor thats why I love him on the Block because passing is the best thing that filipowski does and he draws a double and when you have that shooting around him youre going to open looks nice job out of a timeout same thing coach Greenberg said as well he likes it inside out the method for filipowski zealous oh man hes having a Music half he thought he got fouled and it looked like it what a shot hes got 14 on six of six shooting the wait for a star announcing himself on the big stage still KI on the Block and he gets fouled by Ean Reed his first threes back and forth theres that double in that mid post really nice skip pass over the top and heres Hunter Salis and I am always in a camp of protecting the shooter when the defender whether he hit his hand or not he lands in saless space to me I think thats a foul what a year Hunter Sal has had you know a game like this I said it earlier like you you need your best players to be your best players you need them to show up and he has shown up in this first half what a talent McDonalds all Amer a couple of years ago coming out of Omaha went to Gonzaga and didnt break through there for Mark fugh and his team comes here to wake and hes been outstanding like a lot of transfers have been the last four years for Steve Force Steve Forbes was saying yesterday the first thing I said to him when I went and visited him in Spokane was I want you to start having fun playing basketball again hes doing that confidence is back the former PR star heres Reed banging with young picks up a foul that is three on Ryan young thats big cuz Mitchells got the two and a nice job by Fon Reed I mean he he looked at the matchup saw that young was on him with the two fouls and went right at him so young to the bench at the 204 mark one in one for Eon Reed 90 this year at the free throw line what a difference he has made for Wake fores twotime transfer when LSU then Gonzaga so he was out the first seven games of the year until he got the waiver situation squared away in early December and he has really helped out their defense Music hes actually shot it well from the foul line on the year that was a big Miss inside of two to go in this first half its Duke by four on the road Fosters being hounded by Boy Miller practor seven to shoot matched up with HRI off the BS behind the back off the ball away doesnt go Salis car need hildred and Miller Steve Corb starting lineup hildred off the shot face hes got that wrist injury hes been dealing with that let go car s back first points for Andrew Carr who averages 13 and town Shire takes the timeout good drive got the skip pass by Kim Hil you got to close out short on him cuz he wants the paint theres that shot and then Andrew Carson give me that snatch four years under Steve cors can hear the parents paying tuition for Wake Forest saying you slept where now on a sidewalk and that a school that helped birth Arnold Palmer might be more John Daly today heres practor got a good look hiding behind the screen rebound underneath and nearly a follow from Jared McCain on the offensive Applause glass Jared McCain what hes done on the glass for Duke is unbelievable you know his effort is unquestioned he is constantly in the moment like I Define it a a competitor we you know we use throw that word around a lot a competitor is somebody whos always on to the next moment what can I do on the next play to impact winning thats who Jared mcain is its a guy was talking to John shy about him he said you can coach him hard without hurting his feelings or his confidence which is becoming more rare these days yeah and look at the routine when it comes to breath as well this is part of it for Jared McCain visualization breathing and yoga John sh was telling his prev he got all his teammates to get involved with some yoga last night and he wakes up at the same time every single morning I cant say the same through by four 45 seconds to go in this first half at the Joel and Winston sailor Miller off the E Reed screen had a good first half along with Hunter Salis theyve combined for 25 Salis with his first Miss and about a half second separating game and shot clocks for the Blue Devils up by four jockeying with Reed whos got just the one foul in this half phasi a three wide left and an air ball and Ws going to have 5 Seconds to work with you not sure thats the shot John shy won well wake has forced Duke to play late into a lot of these shot clocks on these possessions wakes half court defense despite Duke shooting 48 has been pretty Solid 5 seconds for boy Miller the Speedy guard for Hill and he gets B by jayen Blakes so thats 10 on Two And so its two free throws for K hildr inside the final second of the Applause half know its tough as a play its a foul clearly its tough as a player that ball is just sitting out there so delicious you think you can you can get a call on it and just late and you commit a bad foul going into halftime I mean you understand it for Blakes its why hes in the game for defensive purposes but costly and it plants cam Hilder at that the line set and hes got his first point and again the significance for Wake porz Joe lonardi says first team out of the field and he said earlier today that should they win it puts him in the field and he said perhaps to stay would be the best win of the season for the te of defense and they cut it to two foster got it off and we head to halftime in Winston Salem with Duke on top of away Forest by two and for John shy this is the significance second half Chris POA Mike mono with you and this has not disappointed the entirety of the first half a two possession game and lived up to yeah you know those two guys we just showed I mean hunter Salis was the best player on the floor in that first half hes got a Target on his back Scouting Report wise its his efficiency six of seven two threes he was good Philip howski when he puts his head out and sides Im going to go inside and muscle this thing he was really effective I think he bails the defense out when he settles for those threes and I thought he had some settles in that first half but he was still obviously very good Duke c a lead is larges six biggest one we saw in that first half and then they went a little bit cold offensively those last three minutes of the first half and the foul set up a couple of free throws they made it a twopoint game at the break and here we go second half in Winston Salem second of six straight mens Hoops games here on ESPN with four top 10 teams in action in those including Duke theres Andrew Carr one of six shooting for him in that first half matched up with Mark Mitchell he had a couple of first half fouls car goes pivoting for but you love Steve forbs out of the locker room going right at Mark Mitchell hes got the two fouls like you said Mike were going to post car up and force Mitchell to have to defend first meeting between these teams last Monday was a big second half for Duke wes defense stev for said wasnt good enough looking for better today car roach foul trouble himself with two only had two points that first half hes got such a good hesitation on that open side ball screen and of course youre playing it with twoman game with Philip hsky who can pick and pop just a tough thing to defend what a senior season it has been for Jeremy roach career year and he has shoted at 46 from three Ste forbs attacks Mitchell again double came on car and Sal St third three and hes got 17 Applause its inexcusable if youre doing you cannot leave him outside of the fact that he was on fire in the first half hes one of the Leagues best players you cannot leave Hunter SS Kowski is on the Block banging with epon Reed and the foul its called on the floor and its an early one second on Applause Reed you have got to stay attached in the half court you cant be ball watching I mean Jeremy Roach theres got to be an awareness on Hunter Salis you cannot leave him to help you cannot leave him to offensive rebound you cannot Daydream you have got to stay with Hunter silus and they wanted to see more aggressiveness from him Steve Corb said to us this morning the next step in his process is becoming an alpha hes done it so far in 22 minutes this afternoon go around the corner tough follower and kowsky the follow CR wanted basket interference they dont get it you love how aggressive roach is to start this half he needs to be a player in this second Music Applause half spinning again on Mark Mitchell Carman out space and scoring with the right Applause hand and Leed and filipowski get tangled nothing more to see there well Steve Forbes and Andrew Carl its a partnership to start the half you love Partnerships like me and you man like me and you brother theyre going to force Mark Mitchell to have to do something and then this has been a physical game so far especially on the interior BR around the corner finds Philip psky again back to work on Fon Reed Philipi foll it in go Mitchell cleans it up and draws the foul every time filipowski catches it on the Block something good happens now there he takes the shot but hes again an outstanding passer and everybody he draws so much attention thats why you want him to catch it there and thats how Mitchells able to sneak in there people watching Philip howski dribble Mitchell just three points in the first half well we mentioned another full day of college hoops right here out ESPN and the we highlight these three games two top teams in the ACC right after us at four Eastern with Carolina against Virginia Texas takes on number nine Kansas and at 8 Eastern in the SEC number five Tennessee against Texas ANM its another massive massive bubble game for Texas AM toxi tury for them recently wa for me while if youre just joining us Joe Lenards first team out hes got Duke is a three SE theyre tied at top the ACC with North Carolina at 12 and three Salis is feeling it Alpha indeed 20 for Hunter Music Salis Duke caught rotation and again nobody on Hunter Salis roach comes up to get it off to B on Miller now Caleb Foster pig in the first half at eight points hardly came off the floor shot clock winding down roach fires knocks it down we said it Jeremy roach at 46 from three would be the best for a Duke player in the last 25 years its having a heck of a year and hes never rattled there is no environment this dude has not seen in four years as a starter at dke car has been busy these first four minutes out of halftime Reed gets the roll two phenomenal offenses two of the best in the ACC top two shooting teams in the league looking like it here this afternoon Mitchell off the boun right by Reed now roach bullying in on Miller Foster shut off on the Baseline he turned it over Salis pushes and hild moves it for Carr Reed cin for matched up with Philip pasy Gonzaga transfer kicks it out for Salis again Hunter Salis is smoking hot and Duke is complicit I mean look there is no sense of urgency to defend Hunter Salis to start this second half look how wide open a first team all ACC player is unacceptable on a huge stage Hunter Salis has been a dude 23 points in 25 minutes five of six from deep and you said Duke is complicit in me its game plan I mean look hes a great player so I hes going to put up numbers but like if we were in a pickup game Mike and you had five threes well that would never happen lets reverse that and I had five threes you would say hey man you got to stay with the guy do not leave him and and Duke has been caught in rotation theres nobody clearly designated to stay with Salis and so these shots have been open shots Ryan young out of the timeout had it roll off but a laate whistle and a foul goes against the de we go back to break Im going try to find a way to mute your microphone after that wake for is that snatched momentum here up by five against number eight Duke but now its three fouls on epin Reed and he is the most foul prone player in all the ACC and fouled down the first meeting against D and hes critical hes been really good in this game this was a late call and given how physical this game has been it it is a touch foul relatively I dont you know he does probably get him on the right arm there and the officials seeing that and officials are human that ball doesnt go into basket thats why that call ends up being late but it is a big time call in this game Steve Corb said to us this morning its the stupid ones his word not mine but hes trying to eliminate with Ean Reed is big man he said hes just got to be smarter and it was after the first meeting against Duke last week he got on Ethan Reed hard for the first time he said old well he saved the layup four triples in this game still 13 to go roach back out proor couldnt hit this time and filipowski couldnt run it down you cant turn the ball over wake did a good job in the first half of not doing that youre not going to be able to go behind your back in traffic and this is where Duke excels turnover they get into that driveing kick nice job by jery roach allowing tyres Proctor to set his feet in a good pitch back the guy in Proctor who John sh has told us he is as good as any shooter weve got theyve been waiting for these kinds of performances from him stroking it Carr faces up on filipowski and now backs him down Carr gets F two on Philipi Duke was going to double and has doubled Fon Reed today they were not going to double Andrew Carr theyre allowing him to go oneonone especially against Philip palski and its just an extended dribble and its like a sumo wrestling match between the two of them inside there wedged really in a basketball game right Kowski was fiery after that whistle as well its been a big Focus for the Duke staff with him Poise and competitors balance hey Wednesday over on acc Network Duke fans will want to watch this the Blue Devils square off against Louisville at 7 Eastern and its followed by the premere of Coach K and Roy Williams Rivals reunited one hour special with the coaching Legend sitting down together with our guy West th wake by one Duke with the basketball John shs team on a fivegame winning streak hottest team in the ACC proor for young now roach accelerates H in the midrange I thought cam hildr came too far over you dont have to help on Brian Young Andrew Carr had him and when you overh help thats what Jeremy roach ends up driving the Clos having a senior season reminiscent of Quinn Cooks in 2015 Salis matched up with mcain who didnt bite and forced alas into a tough one you said a best perimeter Defender for Duke now he pulls up HS The Freshman is special youre good and believing your good thinking youre good is fraudulent believing youre good is backed up by the work youve put in and I I was talking to will Stevens whos been the strength and conditioning coach at Duke for over 20 years hes seen so many great players come through Duke in that time he said hes the hardest worker weve had in my time at dke wow I mean he just is maniacal Jared McCain as a worker Sal draws the foul you said hes on balance physically with his shot we talked about in the first half hes on balance mentally as well in everything he does fourth foul on Ryan Young by the way and he will exit so Mark Mitchell comes back into the game its a silly foul it was a foul Applause youre 40t from the basket and and you know you like the being aggressive with Salis in that ball screen having two guys with with him trapping it trying get to get it out of his hands but youve got to be able to do that without fouling and F read into the game with three he left about 4 minutes ago and wake had its largest lead of this game at five now down by four and hes back in for Steve pors hild goes driving on McCain and out the glass we told you hes playing with a wrist injury we asked him the other day hows the wrist he said to us still broke but hes playing through it even though he should be having surgery and hes been quiet in this game but thats his game driving to the basket nice little touch off the glass Proctor is matched up with Fredrickson Proctor cant hit Salis clears it awake team fourth in the ACC you see the N and6 League record down by two good pass three to tied at 58 now Salis the playmaker out of that high score screen good roll to the ring by Reed and then an extra pass by him big to Big M creating some space and with the left hand on Salis he is their emotional leader you know s for a freshman thats thats impressive he is their emotional leader says Ive gotten really good at being present he calls that his greatest accomplishment Carr underneath the stop back and forth we go 11th different tie weve had this afternoon Roop the screen from Mitchell on the roll Mitchell Applause follows half dozen for Mark Mitchell one of the best offensive rebounders in the ACC car only had two points in that first Music half battling again with filipowski and back out the South five to shoot working on proor sis how good has he been and he loved that match up theres no way Toms P has no shot nice using a body to create the space 25 for Salis number four scorer in the lead cord picked in a roll filipowski for Mitchell short need a shooter in that corner cuz Duke has got really good at at hitting filipowski in the pocket and then hes a really good passer that corner is wide open and it would be open even if it wasnt Mitchell there he does have nine threes in this game this crowd is charged ready to erupt car going to work backing down Mitchell McCain digging back out hildr off the shot pick hildr gets back a little Twan game with HRI and Andrew Carr again extended dribble on the Block and Jared McCain is stunting you know the thing with a stuns watch what K hes coming out hes faking it allows you to be in two places at one time the problem is on a close out he leaves his feet Nice Shot fake and thats what he wants you got to keep your feet hildr does not want three he wants the paint you said it in the first half it should be a short close out on cam Hilger third foul by the way on Philip Housey he and bopy Miller are so good when they get into that paint Mike at shot faking you know Miller with that his slight size hes had to do it his whole life and hildr being an international player hes so fundamentally sound guy who has improved his shot so much as to see Ethan Reed sit for Wake with the risk bothering the threepoint shot for cam hilre splits at the free throw line so its wake by one outside of eight to go in this second half some key misses at the foul line for Wade which is a top three free throw shooting team in the country this season the leowski F by Applause Marsh back and forth we go and no star has shined brighter than Hunter sales for this you said it Mike 10 of 12 from the field up against the sophomore too light nudge nudge over the top hes wet Hunter sales what a day Music now its still a loaded day of college basketball here on ESPN in the app and how about the next three four Eastern number 10 North Carolina against Virginia then its Texas and number nine Kansas and at 8 Eastern in the SEC number five Tennessee against AM in a pivotal game for the yies wake Forest has only been to the NCAA tournament one time the last 13 years that was back in 2017 year four for Steve Forbes Joe lardy right now says first team out two number eight in the country tied for first in the ACC with Kyle filipowski at the line second half in which wake is 11 of 13 from the floor and for the game shooting 63 on its field goals well big part of that is 23 of wakes 38 shots have come from Hunter Salas and Andrew Carr Salas has been left a little bit in this second half but hes efficient to begin with has been all year and Carr has been allowed to go oneonone on the Block and has been hyper efficient Kyle filipowski makes both free throws so its Duke back in front by one and he and tyres practor leading the Blue Devils with 14 a piece Salis off a screen knce to the midrange scores again its 11 of 13 for Hunter Salis again Duke switches not a lot but I I think youve got to have Jared McCain on Hunter Salis I mean hunter Sals eyes are lighting up when he gets poor on him he six off matching a career high proor back to to Philipi left it short loose ball HRI awake running hildr with a one trck mine got it back in between three Blue Devils its out of bounds and stays at this end of the floor this was an unbelievable play by Jeremy roach this is a winning play he gets back and making that play without fouling is really tough and saved the basket they have flip things around and say the basketball belongs to Duke kind of senior play you expect from Jeremy no question not giving up on a play understanding that everyone in a game like this matters a Duke team that has been ascending the last few weeks theyve won eight out of nine and 16 of 18 heres roach again in a spot he loves gets it to go 11 for Jeremy roach hes never rattled a game that from a sheer entertainment perspective as well has filled it up back and forth boy Miller hes the foul and Jeremy roach is so good in the half court moving without the basketball he uses that screen they said a double stagger nice job coming off of it with Pace one dribble right into his shot I mean you can forget you shouldnt but you can that hes got some of the biggest shots in Duke history especially recent you go to that run to the final four Mike I mean hit a massive shot against Michigan State in the second round hit a big time shot against Texas Tech its got some of the biggest shots in recent Duke history like you said its been hyper efficient this year hes been the senior leader that John Shire has needed a fouryear starter at duk since Kyle Singler I mean hes just hes had a prolific career at Duke and if youre just joining us in the first half he and Mark Mitchell dealt with foul trouble Duke with stood it led by two at intermission and its wake by one with 6 and A2 to go in a game with which the entirety has been played within two possessions Roots down the lane and the foul these two offenses have shown out today I mean two of the best in the league two of the best nationally League have shown out hes been able to turn the corner again theyre running him off of that that far corner and hes been able to come off catch turn a corner and then he just a little hang a little hang in the air Mike Monaco something you probably dont know much about very little however he is a good hang gets it done down the lane and also in the process through the third foul on Andrew car stamps a threepoint play and roach joins Proctor and filipowski with 14 each we have our 13th lead change Duke by two so read in car with 3 f000 piece for Steve cors Salis got a switch from roach so now Proctor on Miller y just found out of the ball game with 605 to go Ryan young outside of the Ark fouls out well hes out there to go hard hes not out there to manage his fouls and its been the last two well he puts two hands in a ball handler you can prevent that but Miller had the angle in the corner but his last two fouls for Ryan Young have come off a ball screen cover so the backup big a veteran in his sixth year of college basketball is done with 605 to Applause go thats what you said wful Duty offensively especially with boopy Miller and cam hiler theyre looking to drive you they Applause are we talked about Jeremy roach as well and how he has stepped up after dealing with foul trouble in that first half 12 of his 14 since the Applause break hildr Miller Carr Salis and Reed The W starters are on the floor hand off one there for Salis whos being dog by roach Miller kicks car ho hits weak leads 16 for Andrew car raches down the lane got caught in the air turns it over only the sixth turnover from Applause duke biggest game in this building and a long Applause Music Applause Music time Salis comes up to get it cut off by Philip palowski who commits a foul and that is four on Dukes Superstar with still 519 to go heres this last bucket you know theyre denying Salis and so Miller comes off the secondary action is able to turn the corner but theres the denial the sense of urgency you have to have and then wake spacing is so good they space those deep corners and thats the versatility of Andrew car hes got 14 of a 16 since halftime shot clock below 10 for poopy Miller on the Baseline and its stripped on the way up got it back and missed it and Mark Mitchell the rebound lowski might have taken a shot to the face there he is bleeding and reaching up near his lip and Applause nose so 455 to go in this second half separated by one point wake in front lets have a look at where filipowski got hit here maybe the left arm perhaps of boy Miller looks to be all right mop up the floor a bit and filipowski stays in roach McCain Proctor Mitchell filipowski for John shy te filipowski on the perimeter roach back door a turnover couple costly Duke giveaways the last few possessions it was a set play they were set up that back door and sometimes you premeditate the play youre going to make it was not open and good defensive play by Cam hildr and how about this look defensively for Duke showing his Zone car flashes to the logo HRI kect Applause hire went Zone its only done that on 22 possessions all year 1 of the time and cam hildr made Duke pay McCain flashes h how big is this guy unfazed by the moment flare screen out of the timeout drawn up by John sh drawing up a play a massive possession for his freshman and McCain delivers an ACC freshman of the Year candidate connecting on 40 from three its a skip for hildr off the ball fit hildr attacks and draws a foul if youre just joining us we have three and a half to go its a onepoint game and neither team is led by more than six if that holds it would be the first ACC Le game this year in which neither team ever led by more than six points at any point I think one of the reasons shy went to Zone on that one possession is the penetration from Miller and hildr has started to hurt Duke a little bit so you show Zone and of course HRI who was one of 11 from three in their last eight games coming in hits only his second three in that time yeah huge affected Again by a wrist he told us is broken so he has found other ways and maybe a product too of Duke sending so much attention now at Hunter Salis these last few trips he said he considered surgery still dealing with a ton of pain but didnt want to fail on this season makes it a threepoint weight foris Lees the third foul by the way on Jeremy Roach Crown to its feet at the Joel and Winston sailor roach Dogg by HRI a denal out Proctor 12 to shoot and do it outside the arc still McCain comes to get it from filipowski McCain back for filipowski for three no rebound Miller outstanding defensive position from White Forest a game that has been played in the half court two teams so good in transition it has been focused on these 47 ft on both ends Carr trying to get free from Mitchell its had a monster second half fre a hand off for HRI down the lane lost it on the way up but it will stay with Wake Forest and Duke disagrees 240 to go in the second half close that live that looked like it was off hildr to me hard to tell from that angle I thought so too in real time Miller in the car get the roll 18 for car McCain spins away gets to the midrange got him out of three now roach off the bounce down the lane and gets foul two coming for Jeremy roach and a good bounce back possession with duped down by five its amazing these close games these high leverage games free throws are big and under out of bounds what execution on that play right there to be able to finish off of the catch in the air by Carr and then that was a big possession for Duke they needed to come away with points there you you love the drive youre in the bonus put your head down get it to the paint and get yourself to the foul line at the very least Jeremy roach is good on 86 and a good possession because he got the fourth foul out way cor his big man epon Reed who again for just joining us the first meeting between these teams last week a Duke win at Cameron he fouled out in only 15 minutes into a sea of tie dye roach makes B great Forest connecting on 62 from the floor you got to go back to the mid90s to find a field goal percentage for them as high as that against a top 25 opponent theyre up by three outside of two to go on their home floor as the first team out of Joe lardys projected field MTH comes up to get it tend to shoot defended by roach off the crossover HTH attacks and a blocking foul is called on tyres Proctor late shot clock again and foul against D you said at the top guarding the basketball sitting down in a stance and guarding boopy Miller and cam hildr was a big part of this game yeah thats a block good call and a really good drive from cam hildr how big has he been over the last 5 minutes Mike stepped up after hed been so quiet John Sher was having a conversation with AJ Desai who now convenes with Rod Grover 154 to go in this second half and wait for us to head by Applause three exclanation from AJ decide to John sh that well if were reading body language Maj in that he doesnt appear to love well look hes hes probably asking about that that call I mean the fact of the matter is these are being called blocks now with the way the new rule is written its hard to tell whether Proctor was on that restricted Arc but either way I dont think hes there before that plant foot is down so I I I Im fine with that call Ron grer just came over to share the play on the floor hes calling a basketball block he said it has nothing to do with the restricted start there well there you go res settled glad he came over to explain it we found harmony with 154 to go at the Joel and H a very good free throw shooter at 80 is good on the first stretches the Wake lead to four tense moments on the Duke side winners of five in a row held makes p fivepoint cushion roach navigating the pick and roll got a switch from Carr kicks it out and now Proctor shut off by Miller heres McCain driving on Salis got fouled and left it a little bit short again you love driving it put your head down drive that ball its a good call certainly a block and these become big and again you theres plenty of time if youre Duke I I like picking up a little bit that 221 they showed Le wake a little less time in a half court as McCain sinks the first 84 and Steve Forbes team protecting a fourpoint lead F 37 to go in Applause regulation McCain hits both back to a one possession game Duke extends after the Applause M uses the read screen and now in the hands of the point guard poopy Miller Reed comes to set the high ball screen Miller down the lane and we get a foul called on the Applause floor give it to Mark Mitchell its his third nice job using 20 seconds of the shot clock and again Miller and hildr downhill just a high ball screen Miller able to turn the corner with that burst of his is and back to the foul line this game these high leverage games one possession two possession they come down to the foul line you mentioned Baseline out of bounds side out of bounds and weight traditionally in those specialty areas one of the best free throw shooting teams in the country hild picked it from roach Miller Off to the Races LS it in fivepoint wake lead minute to go roach got stried and its w basketball a strip on a couple of possessions took out by main that does stay with the demon de cam HTH is a bulldog good job just sticking his face in there on that crossover uncharacteristic from Jeremy roges two mistakes from him turning the ball over to wake that one leading to points 59 seconds to go wake into the front Port Reed couldnt haul it in from Salis and thats costly still plenty of time for Duke down by five you dont need it CER for Philip palsky for three man twoo time and score time and score you got Duke on the ropes its going to come down to you making free throws you do not need to throw a lob here two onone or not just a bad game management decision John shy uses his final timeout and Steve for left shaking his head just a bad decision you you know this youre trying to play up to the drama of the moment just pull it back out keep the pressure on on Duke and then how about filipowski his first of the night one of six from three lets get you in the studio for a quick update with Kevin Music conter ESPN the scene here if youre just joining us wait for us by two Joe lardys got him as the first team out of this field for a program that hasnt been to the NCAA tournament in seven years against the number 18 team in the country dealt with foul in the first half theyve steady that in the second half but still Trail against the deeps and the benefit of how quickly Duke was able to get that three from filipowski you do not have to foul you could play this out set your defense and play for a stop to keep this a one possession game hes Chris Bola Im Mike Monaco our entire crew behind the scenes Steve corbs in his fourth year here in Winston sa biggest game and biggest atmosphere in those four seasons and they get to the Finish Line Kyle filipowski by the way with that three in two seasons of college basketball just reached a th000 points hes got 17 to go along with eight rebounds and five assists so 42 seconds to go 19 fouls for Duke wake the third best free throw shooting team in the Music country and to Salis star for away fors and 27 points on 11 of 13 shooting he said it Duke doesnt need the foul with 12 seconds separating game and shot clock heres cam hilber off to Salis in the Carr matched up with Mark Mitchell Carr with the shot clock winding down spinning on the Baseline Pim car against Mitchell short and Mitchell The Rebound with 10 seconds to go toke got of timeouts down by two Proctor turnover it belongs to win just St not having Poise in that moment you know not having Poise three costly turnovers in the last minute of this game for Duke Salis gets fouled with 18 to go I mean its a twopoint game Mike if youre tyres Proctor that things got to go to the basket again youre in the bonus youre down two why are youre trying to give Kyle filipowski the ball there I dont quite understand especially after what a great stand on the other end by Mark Mitchell on Andrew Carr was like protecting the Alamo down there oneonone you got the stop you needed and then you just cough it up three costly turnovers down the stretch here for Duke Salis good on the first how about this stage in moment for Steve forbs in his fourth season he was the only Power five coaching change three years ago during Co step by step he has been trying to build this and Salis makes it a four game we step aside for 30 seconds then right back to the Joel and Winston Applause sailor not a lot of recent NCAA tournament history for Wake for havent been to the tournament since 2017 havent won a game since 2010 to win a couple get to the Sweet 16 well not since Chris Paul and our buddy Randolph childis along with Tim Duncan the the last to get to the elite eight and all the way back to the early 60s to reach the final four and Steve for with the team right now on the bubble according to Joe lardy try to get to the finish line here this has been vintage weight for us today this crowd showed out this team was worthy of that their team has played so well today and for Duke win or lose youre better for being in this game in this environment a scene that has students sleeping on sidewalks we were told sellout crowd for the first time in seven years and an attendance record at week 18 to go duke down by four on the inbounds its picked and the party is down and Winston Music sailor Kyle filipowski is being helped off by members of the Duke staff and you saw the immediate bear hug surrounding him as this court storming is in full effect with filipowski hob wow
