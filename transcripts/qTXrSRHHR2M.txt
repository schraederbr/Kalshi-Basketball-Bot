Duke is 4 and0 the only time they met here Charles Barkleys freshman season 1981 82 a Duke Victory this place is alive right now this should be a great Applause game come on malawat and Janai broom on the tip and Auburn will get first crack at it how impressive were the Tigers out in Maui defeating Iowa State North Carolina and Memphis theyve also going to win over Houston at the Toyota Center in Houston arguably the best resume the best wins of anybody in the country Cardwell the rebound and Chad Baker mazara knocks down the three thats exactly what the way Auburn plays offensive rebound kicking it out for an open three big play to start the game for Auburn J One change in the starting lineup for Duke seon James is at the point instead of Caleb Foster well cion James is a a big guard he can handle it like a point guard he is a very good passer but against this Auburn Tiger team thats really physical he provides a different level of physicality for Duke than Caleb Foster and that was James missing the three the twolane transfer whos been really good Off the Bench the first seven games of the year for the Blue Devils heres the starting lineup for the Tigers again with the the best player in the country to this point of the Season Janai broom and keep an eye on number 13 miles Kelly there he is a transfer from Georgia Tech he had two very good games against Duke last year including 16 points here at Cameron Auburn with a ball reversal and an open side taking advantage of the overplay with a quick back door Cooper flag on the drive up and in and a chance for three Cooper flag has a really quick first step and he can do it driving right or left going against Janai broom just gave a little shot fake got broom off balance and then Dylan Cardwell had to come over and protect the rim wound up fouling him and still Cooper flag able to complete the play Jay they wont always be on each other and by they I mean Cooper flag and Janai broom but theyll be on each other a fair bit how is each coach looking at this matchup well theres going to be a lot of switching in this game so youre right they wont be in on each other all the time but when youre guarding Janai broom what you really have to do is make him go through your chest but I dont think John Shire wants to put Cooper flag in the position of having to guard him all game long so hes on Cardwell right now and wont have to switch off much broom covered by malawat and broom got back to his left hand to lay it in and always wants to get back to that left hand and hes so good at doing it his feet are Elite the MVP in Maui and just had monster games in all three for the Tigers James picks up his dribble broom is on them loose ball back to James with 10 on the shot Applause clock driving on Cardwell needs some help Tyrese Proctor misses the three and Cardwell just does save it Dylan Cardwell was outstanding especially in his last game and Mau he was eight of eight from the field against Memphis scored 18 points and was all over the glass and one of the many players on this team who plays with great energy this is a team that plays as together I think as any team weve seen this year yes Denver or Miles Kelly rather knocks down to three again hes been here before and he does not seem to be bothered At All by the environment it is 102 Auburn Less Than 3 minutes in Miles Kelly is the best perimeter shooter on this Auburn team thats his 17th three of the year and hes also an excellent guard rebounder had 11 rebounds in a game when he was a Georgia Tech against Duke K kiple off to flag got it back got it knocked away and it will stay with Duke one of the things you have to do against Auburn is Gang rebound and after the first Miss by broom nobodys able to block out Dylan Cardwell he immediately shoots it out to the threepoint line to Chad Baker mazara and then broom down low he gets into your body just spins off and seon James couldnt get there to block it because his feet are so quick but Dylan Cardwell is I believe an elite passer after an offensive rebound he always finds a perimeter shooter if he doesnt have a dunk stick back he will kick it out for an open three John sh with a couple of Subs Caleb Foster is in Malik Brown the former Syracuse Orange has checked in as well a guy who could be very important another option to try to defend Janai Brun and Dan one of the things that Auburn does so well of the many is they really guard out of bounds on the side and out of bounds underneath really effectively its hard to get the ball in and score its just its difficult enough just to get it in Bruce Pearl is known as maybe the best in America Bill self gets a lot of a claim here too on out of bounds play both offensive and defensive right yeah yeah I think special situations are going to be a big part of this game who can who can score on their out of bounds plays and who can defend and I dont think theres anybody better at defending out of bounds underneath than auburn is they put a big guy on the ball and Five Guys play their rear ends off for 5 seconds to keep it from coming in boy Kelly is feeling it and he hits another one and an early timeout for John shy with auburn up 11 already Applause Auburn throwing Haymakers in Cameron Indoor Stadium able to run clean offense to start this game Duke expected to put pressure but its Auburn thats applied the pressure early they are five for six from the field three for three from threepoint range and have an 11point lead less than four minutes into this game Auburn has run clean offense and Duke has not been able to thus far in the game because of Auburns defense and their pressure Foster at the point now James has gone to the bench Foster the drive takes a bump and is going to the line Foster able to get the switch Chandy Johnson had to switch off on him and one thing that Auburn does Dan they they they try to build a wall defensively so you have to see more bodies than you can see wood and openings but Auburn will show help but they dont often give help so youve got its amazing their assist percentage defensively theyre only allowing 29 assists on field goals for their opponents defensively thats remarkable and the premise being giving too much help opens up threepoint shooting yes if if you if on a drive Caleb Foster there was able to put Auburn into help then he could spray it to an open SHO shoter you got to close out they can shot fake drive then you got to help again puts in rotation offensive rebound for Cooper flag Bruce Pearl when we asked him about flag today talked about his motor his activity said he is always a threat to go to the offensive glass and come up with a rebound and hes a player that can affect the game without scoring he does so many other things heres the matchup flag and broom flag the pullup out of bounds Auburn ball didnt look like flag got that off before the the buzzer but hes going to have to have the ball in his hands quite a bit in this game because good things happen his his assist percentage is very good John sh told us they track potential assists saying every time a guy makes a good pass that should allow a teammate to score but the teammate misses the shot not the guys fault who made the pass and and shy told us that in terms of potential assist rate that flag is off the charts they just need some of his teammates to make a few more shots must be tough when youre charting it and then its off the charts seems uh kind of contradictory doesnt it yeah so Duke was down 163 to Kansas early came back eventually tied but lost by three in Vegas last week and they dug themselves an early hole in this one as well con kiple lays it in 13 to5 nice job by kiple of playing off two feet if hed gone off of one it would have allowed a block shot attempt instead he goes off two and completes the play we talked about Auburn schedule duks two losses neutral Court losses to Kentucky and Kansas one by five one by three they had a big win down in Tucson at Arizona so theyve been tested as well flag on the drive the turnaround tough shot and it goes to make it a sixpoint game this run by Duke predicated on getting Applause stops all of a sudden theres more pressure on Auburn theyre not able to make easy passes Baker mazara trying to get around K canle tough shot flag the Applause rebound and flag fouled at the other end by Cheney Johnson Cooper flag with the ball in his hands hes got Cheney Johnson on him able to stop Spin and that is not an easy shot but Cooper flag made it look easy and against top 25 teams this year hes averaging over 20 points a game he is a big game player that is the second on Shany Johnson that is a loss for the Tigers he goes to the bench broom is in there as the the five right now and theyve got a smaller lineup on the floor Chris Moore a fifth year player a 66 grad student is into the game and he is on Malik Brown giving up some size in that matchup Moore is their best overall Defender I think Dylan Cardwell is their best Heth Defender Foster the spin and another Auburn foul this one on Toad pedford the fivestar freshman from Jersey City forced a tough two which is what Auburn wants to do they want to force tough twos and not give threes but just a reach at the very end instead of making Foster finish that tough two peder the guy who has been very impressive in the early going this year had 21 points in the win over Houston 14 against Iowa State as Foster steps to the line now for Duke the sophomore from Harrisburg North Carolina again Jeremy roach has moved on hes gone to Baylor so Foster was the starter at the point every game this season until this one seon James started but its not like Foster is not going to see a lot of time on the court and Caleb Foster hasnt gotten untracked so far this year I mean hes a good player but has not played his best and I think Duke needs him to play at or near his best to be the team that they want to be this year a 60 run for Duke to cut an 11point deficit down to Applause five Denver Jones into broom knocked away from behind still belongs to the Tigers and Malik Brown the transfer from cuse guarding Janai broom right now and brown is an excellent Defender he leads this team in steals and offensive rebounding and thats his 49th deflection on the season for Duke that leads the team by more than double and last year with Syracuse led the ACC in Steels and it was a member of the ACC all defensive team and he might be the most ideal matchup that Duke has for Janai Brun they give up a little on the offensive end but hes an outstanding Defender Chad Baker mazaro with his second three of the night shooting over 45 from three and he is one confident player right now he is one of several uh for the visitors Baker Mazar a member of the old tournament team out in U a nice scoop and finish by Foster when you drive against Auburn you have to drive to score you cannot drive to pass because they are not going to help out theres another deflection whats that 50 that would be 50 would be 50 but heres Baker mazara just coming off that little stagger Iverson cut and heres the drive you got to drive to score if youre trying to spray it they are not helping and that last bucket of two for Baker mazara so 151 Auburn aubt 0 and four all time against Duke the last time they met Maui 2018 other than that you got to go back 40 plus years for the other three and again Duke has won all four games Isaiah Evans into the ball game for Duke the Freshman who is a bucket getter still learning the game as John Shire told us today but boy can he be a game changer if he is having a good night and now a Duke foul I think its Mason Gillis the Purdue transfer reaching in and it is its on Gillis A guy a proven guy but a guy the Blue Devils would love to get a little bit more out of he is not shooting the ball very well so far this year well last year at Purdue I mean hes a career 40 threepoint shooter but he had Zack Edy to play off of and Edy had a lot of double teams that came to him sometimes triple teams so you had a little more open space and you knew where your shots were coming from hes just going to have to adjust Cooper flag is the one Duke player who has not the one Duke starter who has not come out of the game yet Brown knocks it away again he is really an elite defensive player well hes got great hands you know a lot of guys they try to reach from behind a big guy theyre going to foul so hes got long arms great hands and brooms going to have to move the ball around in order to try to draw a foul Baker Mazzara into broom lots of time on the shot clock remember broom is LeftHanded there it is off the glass too strong and its down to the Blue Devils Duke did such a great job rebounding against a good rebounding team in Arizona at male theyre going to have to do a better job against Auburn on the glass its got to be all Five Guys on the defensive class against this team Brown comes up top to help him run some offense its deflected and its turned over really good job by tahad peder and Chris Moore they switched that exchange and peder able to get his hand in the passing Lane to knock it away fivepoint lead Auburn 823 into this one Music when you play against a Bruce Pearl coach Auburn team youre going to have to negotiate a lot of different screening actions Miles Kelly Down Under the basket Duke switching these exchanges he sets a back screen and then gets a down screen all of a sudden Cooper flag is on him he switches out off Cardwell but you have to switch out to take something away and flag doesnt switch out with a hand up to take that threepointer away and Miles Kelly who had an outstanding career at Georgia Tech hes played in this building before is off to a great start hes got seven points hes not yet missed a field goal hit a couple of Threes And he is an excellent guard rebounder as well so you have to block him out whenever hes on the floor on the bench right now as toad peder had checked into the game pedford on gone back to the bench and JP Pages a transfer from Ferman thats him of the point right now really Bruce Pearl kind of alternating three different guys at times at the point guard spot Denver Jones will see some time there as well broom got by Brown and got fouled there was just no help everybody was watching their man on the weak side instead of watching the ball so broom was able to get all the way to the 10 from really 25 30 ft from the basket so Janai broom again arguably maybe in arguably playing better than anybody else in the country right now hes a fifth year player two years at Morehead State now in his third year with auburn monster numbers as you can see each and every game out in Maui how did he develop into this kind of a player under Bruce Pearl the last three years well he was under recruited out of high school and when he wound up hes from Florida and Florida Florida State they didnt recruit him and so he went to Morhead State he was Ohio Valley player of the year he was all defensive team Defensive Player of the Year and when he transferred to Auburn Bruce Pearl and his assistant Steven Pearl his son had said hey well see if he can put up these kind of numbers in the SCC and he has and hes done it consistently and he continues to get better because now he can knock down to three boy Gillis just wrestled that ball away from Moore to get du possession and I think Duke now can attack JP Pages hes not the quickest guard and right now hes guarding Isaiah Evans but if I were them Id drive him Evans gets the three off and hits the Freshman from fville North Carolina a McDonalds allam makes it a threepoint game Isaiah and Evans has scored 23 points over his last two games those games were against wford and Seattle but John Shire wanted to put him in and give him a chance cuz he gives them a different dimension he did not play a minute against Kentucky Arizona or Kansas so this is his first action in a real big time game here this season and boy he made an early statement with that three what a rebound by Janai broom who leads the nation in rebounding misses the three again hes got the green light to take that and here comes Duke at onepoint down 13 to two flag that would have tied it but he missed way long malawat now defending broom Moore takes a rare shot not a guy who looks for his offense much and we got a call going against Janai broom thatll be his first now sure Bruce PE wanted that shot from Chris Moore but lets take a look at Isaiah Evans here hes being guarded by JP Pages hes right here hes going to come out and wind up on the other side of the floor and get a contested three but he comes off that screen by malow watch and he squares up and just lets it fire he is a really talented offensive player and a very confident player as well getting some good minutes again getting some run in a very high caliber game for the first time this year flag de malawat now Foster the drive and he hits to make it a onepoint game and there was the drive against pagis hes a player defensively that I think Duke can attack Baker Mazzara a couple of early bucks forces it up and in and is heading to the line as well Chad Baker Mazzara is a lefty he started his career at Duane went to San Diego State where he was the Mountain West Sixth Man of the Year he is long athletic he can drive it and a good threepoint shooter but one thing he does he is unafraid even gives a little look to the Duke crowd right after he knocks in that difficult shot getting fouled now he goes to the line for the threepoint play yeah he is unafraid of engaging fans of other programs as well as we have seen a terrific player again a member uh of the all tournament team out in Maui last week hes had five consecutive double doubles and hes well on his way already tonight thats his eighth point or five consecutive double figure scoring games forgive me it well on his way with eight points 10 12 minutes into this one hes guarding K canle right now trying to top lock him so canle cant come out on that same side Foster the turnaround too strong and it bounces down to the Tigers Miles Kelly ahead to Baker Applause mazara so Baker mazzaras got eight Kellys got eight the two of them have 16 of the 19 broom at the other three Kelly a great look and he hits again Kelly was the first cutter and that was all set up so that Dylan Cardwell could set a little pin down for him to pop right back out to the threepoint line that was just beautifully executed by Auburn broom on the bench for the moment for Auburn flag on the bench for the moment for Duke you talk about an open look Isaiah Evans with his second three of the game Auburn by four Kelly thought about it and can you blame him the way that this one is going for Applause him four on the shot clock piges the drive evence the save and here comes kiple Applause kicks it out Evans again hits Applause again Isaiah Evans introducing himself to college basketball fans around the country he has made three threes in this game and the Freshman has the Blue Devils back within one against the Tigers here at Cameron well John shy told us to shoot around a day if he were an opposing coach and he saw Isaiah Evans checking into the game hed have a little bit of concern because if its clicking as young as he is as much as hes learning Jay if he is on hes got a chance to turn a game on its side well especially if he gets started like this hes hit three threes in this ball game nine points the first one he hit was under duress but then hes had two open ones and thats going to spread the floor a little bit and you have got to pay attention now to Isaiah Evans and I agree with you Dan he has announced his arrival as a player here you know mentioned he played extraordinarily well against both wford and Seattle thats not quite Auburn but hes come into this game against Auburn and he has shown no fear especially on the offensive end again not a single minute against Kentucky Arizona or Kansas but certainly seems to be handling his minutes against Auburn very well the Tigers once led by 11 its down to one and now up to three what a drive by broom just got him to the right wing so he could get to that left hand against malow seon James back into at the point now for Duke so far Auburns done a pretty good job on K canle he hasnt had any open opportunities what a rebound by James and then a foul both pedford and broomer there its going to go on pedford and thats where pedford has to just be a little bit smarter in that situation you know hes got Janai broom behind him and broom is one of the best shot blockers in the country hes averaging three blocks a game let broom wipe that away just try to be as big as you can but you dont want to foul there and take away brooms opportunity to block a shot the second annual SEC ACCC challenge continues Thursday with womens matchups number 18 Old Miss against NC State at 7 Eastern on ESPN 2 then our ESPN double header number four Texas number 10 Notre Dame and then another great match up number eight Duke and number three South Carolina James at the line and makes them both and again its a onepoint Applause game peder trying to get him lined up the way he wants to the offensive end gets it back Proctor way out on Kelly respecting his ability to shoot shot clock down to seven tipped Away by Brown pedford the force almost banked it in its Duke Applause Music ball and another three for Evans and Duke leades down 11 early and Isaiah Evans has brought him back and into their first lead of the night and Malik Brown oneonone in the post against Janai broom knocks it away again a its remarkable broom was holding that ball out and Brown still able to reach around from behind and knock it away Brown not a guy who needs the ball not a guy need to run plays for just a guy who goes out there and plays great defense and he is really making Janai broom work so far look like they got a foul on Dylan Cardwell rebound number two on him so Johnson has two pedford has two Cardwell has two for Auburn Applause yeah Cardwell just coming in from the left side just gives a shove to Cooper Applause flag so flag The Freshman to the line for the Blue Devils hes got four points seven rebounds already and two assists in this game this is one and one well Duke was able to take the lead in this game in part because of the great shooting from Isaiah Evans when he was put in the ball game but also Dukes pressure defensively has been much better after the slow start they got off to theyve made it very difficult for Auburn to run clean offense in the half court flag makes them both and the lead is grown to four Bo how about a 15point swing already in this Applause game pedford used the screen too strong off the glass Duke ball Evans not this time but its tipped out by who else brown Browns able to affect the game without scoring a point and hes got a mismatch with Kelly and tips it up and in Bruce Pearl is screaming for basket interference but they play on Applause Brown is really frustrating Janai broom hes got to be careful not to pick up an offensive foul here Cardwell and almost stolen by Brown yet another deflection pedford hits the three big big shot for Music Auburn hes another guy that plays his best in big games you mentioned the 21 points he put on Houston and Bruce Pearl said he won US the Houston game Proctor follows it and is fouled and its number two on Janai broom that was all because of a miscommunication on a switch by Auburn pedford lost him but heres Malik Brown was this in the cylinder yeah it looked like it was yeah sure looked like it boy how badly did they need this shot thats one of those thats a really difficult shot but Auburn has not been able to get anything easy over the last 12 minutes or so so again the foul on Broom his second Cheney Johnson is coming in but its not for broom Cardwell who also has two is going to sit and listen to the Ovation for Evans as the Freshman checks out for Applause Duke what a huge lift Isaiah Evans gave to this Duke team with his shooting an eightman rotation that John shy has been running Jay appears to now be a ninan rotation Evans will give his coach no choice the way that he is playing hes four for six from threepoint range off running some five out another deep three for tahad peder boy we got some players in this game yeah two big answers from Dad Applause peder well Auburn needs to clean up some of these switches Cooper flag was wide open tyres Proctors wide open cant hit the three and a good box out there by the Tigers pedford coast to coast and the follow is good and a foul Cheney Johnson well pedford knew if he could get to the rim there was a great opportunity for an offensive board were he to miss and Cheney Johnson right there for it what a game weve got in Cameron Indoor Stadium plays being made on both ends of the floor Applause but because of Dukes Improvement defensively over the last 10 12 minutes or so you Auburn really hasnt been able to get into some of the Staples that it runs that Baseline Flex action they really havent been able to get the ball inside Malik Brown one of the reasons why hes been one of the stars of the game or one of the most important guys on the court so far dont you think and the numbers dont jump off the chart but again hes not in there to score points hes in there to play great defense and he has certainly made Janai broom work very hard for his touches flag takes a bump off the glass no TI by Brown and down with it Kelly for the Tigers boy flag took a huge bump from Miles Kelly no call pedford has given the Tigers some very good Applause minutes some foul trouble for Auburn three guys with two fouls here in the first half a turnover the first of the game by the Tigers and the flush for Proctor peder called for a ball screen got caught up in it just fell down and that turned into an easy bucket for Proctor on the other end and the lead changes hands again now Proctor on Broom he can back him down and the foul on Proctor that is the fifth team foul on Duke here in the first half but its number two on Proctor as you get another look at the turnover in the dunk so Proctors going to sit and Evans is back into the game and Proctor not happy that he hes got to sit the rest of the half he hasnt gotten going yet hes got four points the dunk was his first field goal of the Applause night a touch for broom again Brown defending and broom left it short brown the rebound great job of Walling up and making broom make the tough two over the top of him Evans again unbelievable performance here in the first half by The Freshman Isaiah Applause Evans and I mean Jay hes catching it and he is letting it Fly you talk about confidence Baker mazara speaking of confident with the answer at the other end yeah Isaiah Evans has been conscience free coming into this game he is playing with a free mind on the offensive end and what a an impressive performance Chad Baker mazara is guarding him now Baker mazara with 11 himself now Kelly is on Evans after a switch Evans the drive had it knocked away and it belongs to Auburn with numbers and Baker mazara threw it away now Duke in transition Foster for three duke leads by four Caleb Fosters some really good minutes for Duke tonight Auburn makes a mistake and Duke turns it into a three in transition defense Kelly through traffic Brown might have gotten a piece of it flag what a pass Foster look at the offensive rebound by kiple Evans again no way 63 for Isaiah Applause Evans Isaiah Evans has been like a video game out here its unbelievable and John Shys decision to give him some run in a game like this for the first time this year boy has that paid off Duke was down 11 three minutes into the game they now lead by seven and Duke has the possession arrow so they can get a score here they can get the ball first in the second half Moore down with a rebound off the Miss by flag time for Auburn broom will try a three Applause and that will bring the first half to a close and what a first half it was and for that guy more than anybody else each team went seven for 15 from threepoint range Evans will start the second half on the bench as will Malik Brown and if Evans is the headliner for Duke Malik Brown has to be right there with him for what he did on the defensive end and how tough he made life for Janai broom in the first half broom just two for nine in this game Five Applause Points another thing Auburn needs to do is handle pressure better in this second half Dukes pressure really limited what Auburn Auburn could do on the offensive end flag misses a three he is also just two for n tonight but hes got 10 rebounds three assists a block and a steal so he is helping Duke in a number of ways well Duke has gang rebounded on the defensive end all five guys have gotten to the glass Jones with a long two Proctor may have gotten the piece of it but it bounces to broom who lays it in every time theres an airball its Advantage to the offensive end the defense is expecting it theyre trying to block out expecting it to hit the rim flag gets a piece of the paint and knocks it down he is just unfappable Duke by seven again Auburn led by 11 early in this game 13 to two and then Duke Ro back led by Evans Jones little stop and go lost it two onone kiple James and the Finish looked like they got a foul on Dylan Cardwell they did and hopefully James is okay he hit the court hard but if youre talking about guys who are built to withstand the punishment seon James right at the top of the list well you cannot guard a run out this is not part of transition defense but a good job the ball really never touched the floor and Dylan Cardwell trying to stop what would have been an easy dunk it was a hard dunk because of the foul but seon James that is a big strong athlete youre going to have to do more of them and the officials have gone to the monitor so evidently they are looking to see if this should be upgraded to a flagrant I cant imagine they would do that it looked like Cardwell was going after the ball but anytime a player hits hard they feel like they have to Applause look if a player takes a wild swing thats not thats just a normal foul theres nothing there but the fact that the arm hit him across the face is that going to have an impact on their decision no it shouldnt because he went after the ball who knows what the officials are going to do but he went after the ball here and when you go off one foot its a lot more difficult to maintain your balance when theres contact but theres no question in my mind he was going after the ball if it stays as a common foul then James will shoot one more free throw if they upgrade it then its two and they get the ball Ron groover Bill Covington Jr Clarence Armstrong the officials well theyre talking about it this long that means somethings going to happen Ron gr will let us know after review the play has been upgraded to a flager one gr will have two free throws and that the ball underneath the basket with 20 on the shot so upgraded to a flagrant one one way or another its also number three on Cardwell so James the bucket two free throws and then Duke is going to get the ball well James has to shoot the free throw he still has a free throw to Applause shoot boy thats a big call and I think youre right it must have been the fact that there was contact made with the head but there wasnt a wild swing thats an interesting interesting interpretation so James all by himself at the line This has a chance to be a very productive trip for the Blue Devils Applause Music Applause and what a pickup in the transfer portal seon James has been a fouryear player at two lane scored a better than a th000 points and everybody talks about him as the the dream teammate the dream guy to coach on student athlete advisory committees and so forth I mean brings a ton of intangibles and also is a terrific basketball player made one of the two and now the blue deves get it Applause can nipple to Applause inbound malow watch the screen Proctor up top and malow watch the finish and it winds up being a fiveo trip for Music Duke well we talked about Auburn running clean offense the first four minutes of this game there has been nothing Clean Run since then and as we told you off the top of the show coming into the game Auburn number one in the nation per Ken pomet offensive efficiency Duke number one of the nation in defensive efficiency but Duke has really been so so good at the offensive end since the first few minutes of the game yeah Duke doing a great job on that last possession of lifting everybody up good play and Moore has it blocked by malawat but theyre going to count the basket that will be a goal tending call they are going to look at it at the next time out but for the moment the basket will count and it did look like it hit the glass first dont you think I do yeah so that will probably stand but by making the call then they have the opportunity to go look at it at the next media time out by the way that last foul was on Proctor it is his third hes still in the Music game flag a size advantage and he just bullies Jones in underneath the bucket and lays it in Duke is taking on the switches by Auburn when they have an advantage trying to get the ball in Cooper flags hands whenever they can because he makes such good decisions with the ball hes into double figures now Johnson from the elbow short rebound m watch and theres nothing but white shirts going after the ball in the defensive glass they have limited Auburns offensive rebounding flag again James the tip Moore comes down with it for the Tigers but they lose it and James is headed back to the line boy Auburn is just so loose with the ball Chris Mo picks it up just gives a very poor pass to Denver Jones and seon James right there to go back to the line and this is just Cooper flag using his size just going right into the chest of Denver Jones and going over him in the middle of the lane and because Auburn is not helping there it was just oneonone essentially oneonone in the post James will miss the first foster coming in Doctor Whos got three is going to sit at some point you have to expect that Auburn is going to try some full court pressure to try to change the tempo of this game as duke has limited Auburn essentially to being a halfcourt team and they havent been able to run much half court offense boy James missing some opportunities here hes missed three of his four free throws last couple of trips Jones into broom the spin got it back and lays it in well even though malow hatch had to switch off well he came back and really impacted that play around the rim gr now with nine points and five rebounds but again hes had to work so hard for that and as we say that Malik Brown has gone to check in at the scores table flag defended by Johnson hell pull up miss the three James another offensive rebound and Duke just all over the offensive glass right now Jay thats 11 offensive rebounds now for the blue doubles Duke has been quick to the ball on longer rebounds a great start in the second half for the Blue Devils they have extended the lead they are up 12 410 into the second half ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is presented by McDonalds Applause Music Applause Music Applause that Auburn has and he kept his promise hes now in his second year as a manager at home watching this one tonight guys Chris thank you a wonderful story Bruce Pearl one of the many many coaches who does such an outstanding job raising money for cancer research and and while were on the topic and I know hes watching our buddy Dicky V is going to get more results hes been through so many tests and so many rounds of treatment dick I know youre watching we love you were thinking of you and we hope youre back in an arena doing what you love calling a basketball game before too long were all thinking about you Dicky V boy what a great play by Chad Baker Mazar on that last possession and knock the ball he couldnt get it so knock it back out to pfer for that three and Auburn really needed that back down into single digits Duke though still leading by nine can nipple back to Foster 10 to shoot Foster some really good minutes in the first half everything but the finish on that Drive Blue by his Defender just couldnt lay in the reverse peder around the screen from broom shovel pass and a layan beautiful twoman basketball he was calling for that middle ball screen and then Janai broom just rolled right to the basket nobody picked him up on the switch broom now with 11 peder some really good minutes for Auburn tonight now heres the switch peder on flag flag gives it up now relocates and its out to Brown Foster with a broom on him tries to drive him picks up his dribble three to shoot flag hits Applause it he is just a big time player Cooper flag impacts the game in just about every facet rebounds passes block shots oh pord what a stop and go and then lays it in with the reverse another big bucket for the Freshman hes a lefty went to that left hand to avoid the block shot and heres what Auburn needs to do is pick up the pace with full court pressure four on five five now Brown gets into the play for the Blue Devil still lots of Applause time Foster they switch out on him now flag shot clock inside four and the turnaround he draws a foul and well head to the free throw line just couldnt keep his hand out of the cookie jar did a good job of Walling up but heres peder the the roll and brown just couldnt pick him up and just a great pass then Cooper flag catches the ball that first step is so quick Chad Baker Mazzara is a good Defender he just blew right past him into the middle of the lane Music Applause little late night basketball for you Saturday night 1000 Eastern on ESPN 2 and a great matchup it will be Kentucky and Gonzaga now the Wildcats remember they lost last night at Little John Clemson got them theyll be looking to play well up in Seattle when they take on the zags this doesnt count as late night basketball its a little past Jays comfort zone for bedtime here this is a late start but boy has it been fun Isaiah Evans has checked in for the first time this half and brown makes another good defensive play and Cooper flag right there as well again Duke an outstanding defensive team so far this year Evans misses the Applause runner Baker mazara hell go to the free throw line boy he you got to respect the shot but you also got to respect the drive with him yeah you have to square him up and K kiple on him in the left corner and Mazzara Lefty got away with a little push there at the end this is one area where Auburn hasnt spent much time they havent been at the free throw line very much at all in this game while Duke has shot a ton of free throws they just havent made Applause him he is one of four tigers at this moment each with 11 points give them 12 now but balance scoring between Baker mazara broom Kelly who got all of his early and pedford Off the Bench theyve got four in double figures as now kiple is going to sit and Gillis is back in for the Blue Devils and even though Auburn has faced a ton of pressure on the offensive end and it has not been an easy game I mean were looking at a two possession game with 12 12 to go in regulation there is a long way to go in this one both of these coaches will tell you and have told us they have learned so much about their teams because of the strength of the schedule they played in the early going and heres Auburn doing what you said they should do trying to make the game a little bit more chaotic yeah Cheney Johnson just stepping out of bounds as he was throwing that back into play Im not sure he was out of BS it looked more like more look more like Cooper flag was the one that stepped out Duke ball Evans to Applause inbound first true Road game of the year for Auburn a lot of very tough neutral sight games and obviously this is a tough place to win both because of the quality of the Duke program and the building and the building has been alive all night long it has been a great night so far and Malik Brown slams it home on the weak side to make it a sevenpoint lead on that drive Janai broom came over from the weak side to try to block that shot if you dont get it Malik Brown all by himself for the offensive rebound thats where sometimes a strength shot blocking can turn into a weakness if you overp pursue Baker Mazzara into broom another slip and another f it boy Janai broom just so strong and playing in the middle of the floor its so difficult to give help but both Mason Gillis and Malik Brown right there that middle ball screen he slips right out of it and that is strength on strength its not Dr James naith I just think I invented the game but take a look at how Duke is handling Auburn switching come on Mowat going to set a middle ball screen here youre going to see a switch from Auburn he just slips out of it and in kind of Spain action and then another middle ball screen run higher Auburns going to switch a favorable matchup for Cooper flag with Denver Jones He is bigger just takes him into the middle of the floor theres no help he just scores right over the top lets take a look at tonights wooden watch presented by principal a couple of preseason allamericans in Janai broom hes starting to get his numbers been more effective in the second half hes got 13 and seven a Cooper flags got his third double double of the season and broom has been more effective in the second half because Bruce Pearl has put him in some middle ball screen action and hes been able to roll strong down the middle of the lane without help being present broom third in the nation in Block shots first in rebound bounding and averaging better than 20 a game coming into this one and thats his 14th Point here tonight and hes a terrific passer as well I mean youre in in broom and flag youre talking about two guys who can impact the game in so many different ways no question and Auburn going with some full court pressure it just disrupts the rhythm of the game and bro has to be careful here not to reach and get a foul there it is there it is and three you could see it coming its not Applause Music necessary you admire the tenacity but when your best player picks up his third foul that far away from the bucket and with this much time remaining in regulation Foster the drive a good job by Denver Jones to get back around in front Auburn decided not to switch that Foster Baseline Scoops it up tipped in by brown but theyre going to wave it off thatll be basket interference and that time Janai broom had to come over from the weak side and just give it a look but he wasnt going to put himself in a position to foul just kind of ran by him theres no question that was on the rim yeah once again they will look at it the next time out but you could see easily there that that was the correct call so Here Come the Tigers they got it down to four and they got the ball and again broom slips and he slams and its a twopoint game great adjustment by Bruce Pearl against Dukes switching defense just clearing the middle letting Janai broom go to work so what does John Shire do to try to counter it now that Auburns in a groove of the offensive end well if youre going to switch you have to get right back in front Miles Kelly the foul you have to stay between Janai broom and the basket like theres just too much you had two on the ball and that really wasnt a switch it was just putting two on the ball and broom so youre asking another Defender to rotate over thats is not going to Applause happen Browns going to sit malawat back in for Duke a highlevel basketball game here as part of the SEC ACC challenge dominated by the SEC but tonight two of the best teams in their respective conferences two of the best teams in the country going toe totoe here in Durham boy KH kiple has not that was his first open look of the game they have done a great job limiting his touches and his ability to get a shot Applause off Kelly to Johnson T to shoot great job by Tyrese Proctor to take away the back door by Mazzara broom knocked away out of bounds and its ruled that its off of broom out of bounds its back to Applause Duke I think thats flag reaching in he created the loose ball and its going to be Duke ball yeah it hit brooms leg looked like it also hit Cooper flags hand but those are bang bang plays and tough to call more pressure from the Tigers and now James will bring it over as we have reached the Midway point of the second half in a twopoint game and another Auburn foul this time itll be Cheney Johnson and thatll be his third so all three big guys Cardwell broom and Johnson each now with three fouls Auburn getting hung up on these screens trying to switch them just a really good screen by seon Applause James that was asking a lot for Cheney Johnson they negotiate that screen get back around in front another thing that flag does very well is draw fouls and one of the reasons he does that is because of how active he is hes never just standing still now a turnover on the the inbounds thats what armor does so well they put a big guy on the ball and Five Guys bust it for 5 seconds to keep you from getting a scoring play broom spinning and he turned it over again and last two times Down Jay instead of broom receiving the ball as hes slipping to the goal hes been trying to initiate the offense with the dribble and hes 0 for Applause two still a very low turnover game considering the pace but now its starting to creep up a little bit on Auburn well most Auburns turnovers a number of them has have come with Duke taking it the other Applause way flag Proctor good fake the three Music Applause Music yes Ty ree Proctor knocks down a three duke by Music five what are you looking forward to well the Timberwolves are the best defens team in the NBA last year they have not been that this year had a great defensive performance against the Lakers the other night but itll just be great to work with a real pro bill rafter you great to work with a real Pro Ryan ruko hes all yours Duke with a little one two two three4 cord pressure and Ron Gro the lead official tonight on I dont know exactly what he is saying to Bruce Pearl but it may be that you and yours have to stay on the bench Music and be a little less up and maybe on the edge of the Court just a warning there from Ron Grover longtime Music Applause official Bruce Pearl about as active on the sideline as any coach in America sevenpoint game Duke on top Auburn ball theres that Flex action that Auburn likes to run theyre going to pick up a foul on Cooper flag but duks done a great job of guarding that Baseline Flex which is a a staple of Bruce Pearl coach teams lets check in with Chris who is nearby the last Auburn huddle yeah ji broom visibly frustrated sitting on the bench and Chad Baker mazara the entire time in his ear reminding him youre the best player in the country you were made for moments like this theres 9 minutes left prove to everyone While Youre great and broom just sat there staring while Baker Mazar just kept reiterating positive things in a here well speaking of positive things tood peder with another three his fourth of the game and its a fourpoint game Duke on top he is a walking bucket Isaiah Evans led the way in the first half for Duke made six threes scored 18 points has not scored has not played a whole lot in the second half boy flag absorbing the contact and finishing Cooper flag has taken advantage of Auburn switches when he gets a little guy switched out on him he just went right to the bucket and peder just reached up with those arms and caught a piece of flags arms but still hes able to complete the play Just stops on a dime decelerates that was a huge basket and its the fourth foul on tood peder the Walking bucket as you just called him and at least for now Bruce Pearl is going to leave the freshman in the Applause game nobody stops the ball and peder lays it in oh come on malow watch turned his head after the initial thrust there was a hesitation move and he turned and peder took advantage of it 16 now for pedford boy he continues to play his best in Auburns biggest Applause games under eight to go flag again and malawat is going to get called for the push off we got ourselves a game here at Cameron and J we got all kinds of players playing some terrific basketball right now it was weird when Syracuse would play Notre Dame in an ACC game now you got now you got Stanford oh boy weve had to do a lot of recalibrating the last few years all over the country we got a good one here Dan shman Jay billis Chris Buon Duke 66 Auburn 61 when Auburn plays Five out I think they can get some drives in this one deep one for Kelly and he hits wow he was the big story in the first four or five minutes of the game quiet since but knocks down a three to make it a twopoint game thats his fourth made three of the night flag slips got back to his feet leans in and hits thats unbelievable hes hes limping on his way back down the floor and just reached for his left hamstring might be a little cramping hes had that issue earlier in the year something to keep an eye on peder boy are guys making plays right now that was a difficult long two by tahad peder but there arent many shots out there he cant make pedford with 16 and again remember he is playing with four fouls Proctor open for just a moment missed the three and its down to the tigers with a chance to tie or take the lead peder Applause again Welly you talk about the confidence that one freshman and Evans showed in the first half and now were seeing the same kind of Confidence from pedford here in the second half and that was right online just front rimmed it Applause bodies are flying and we got a foul call against Auburn its going to be on Applause Kelly well Tad peder can make individual plays just a step back move long two over seon James and drains it then Cooper flag goes down keeps the dribble gets back up and then executes a little step through and scores with the left hand what a big time play and again limped a little bit you can see him he just kind of hes working on that left leg hes got something going on with his left leg he just pointed to his left knee yeah he did and Im not sure thats for from when he went down and kept his dribble on that last play or whether theres some sort of cramping issue going on its hard to tell whatever it is he has obviously convinced the bench that he can stay and Janai broom gets a timeout called with 608 to go to keep possession a twopoint game here at Cameron were back in Music Music 30 the Maui Invitational in program history entering this year this is hard to believe only only four nonconference wins over ranked teams in program history entering this year Jay its December the 4th and theyve already got three this season could pick up a fourth here tonight well both these teams have played incredibly difficult schedules to start this year pedford has it swatted Music away and for coaches a great way to learn about your team and for fans how much funner are matchups like this and and a tip of the cap to both of these coaches for playing the schedules they have well these are the games that everybody wants to see and every player wants to play it and Auburn by the way still has Ohio State and Purdue to come in the next couple of weeks I dont know what that pass was a behind the back pass on out of bounds underneath that is just not good execution and not a good idea by Auburn James floats it up and here Duke by four well that turnover on out of bounds underneath was a big play Baker mazara no broom with the rebound pord wide open Johnson the rebound and yet another opportunity for the Tigers pedford splits a p a and floats it up and in the Lefty knocks it down with his right hand another huge bucket for the Freshman how much game does he have splitting those Defenders he missed that three that was as wide open as hes been in this game under 5 minutes to go in regulation Proctor backs it out and once again with a shot clock running down itll be flag blocked Proctor got it off and Applause hits he knew he had to take it the shot clock was at one and he buried it now now Johnson how did that not go down four minutes to go duke by five Proctor Proctor should have driven peder there they got the foul on Miles Kelly but what a shot by Tyrese Proctor loose ball shot clock winding down it looked like Auburn may be able to take this thing the other way but Tyrese Proctor the presence of mind to knock that down as the shot clock going down to zero Big Time broom has had to work hard for his 16 and 10 flag at 17 and 11 this is one and one for flag who is three for six from the line tonight and Duke as a team is just 10 for 19 from the free Pro Line two of eight in the second Applause half we saw it in the Kentucky game we saw it in the Arizona Game and were seeing it tonight uh Cooper flag has been a great second half player Jay in all of these big games that Duke has been in well and hes a big game player and he brings his best out in the biggest games and this has certainly been one of Applause them Janie Johnson will take a three and a foul underneath on tyres Applause Proctor Janai broom carves out so much space as a wedge rebounder he just wedged inside of Malik Brown there and Tyrese Proctor had to help out his hands are like vice grips Denver Jones going to check in pedford will sit again pedford has got four so this could be a little bit of offense defense here yeah Jones the better Defender hes an underrated perimeter Defender and BR room a 62 free throw shooter misses the front Applause end boy a real scrap for the basketball and then Bill Covington one of the officials is going to walk Chad Baker mazara out of the scrum I dont think he thinks that Baker mazara had any bad intent there but he just wanted to get him out of there before anything escalated Applause and I I think cumington did exactly the right thing Im not sure where Baker mazaro was going at that point his teammate was up uh the play was over everybody was fine but Baker Mazzara is an emotional guy and that can serve them well uh on a lot of occasions um we are told the officials are going to the monitor right now theyll see if anything happened in there that they didnt like Applause I dont know do you think Baker Mazar its hard to judge intent obviously but he got himself right in the middle of it maybe he thought something untoward happened to Cheney Johnson his teammate but but it looked like by that point everything had been settled well but what would they call here I mean its not like there was an elbow thrown or punch or a push I dont I dont know what you call here to me its just lets move on the officials did a nice job its over and it looks like that is the ruling no call Applause so the officials trying to get both teams back on the court the tigers are on the Blue Devils are still in a huddle right now and now here come their five Auburn ball down seven Music Applause well thats an offensive foul Chad Baker mazara just threw now that they should review if they didnt see it which seems hard to imagine Chad Baker mazara just threw seon James to the floor thats got to be a foul Applause Music and that could even because the ball wouldnt in play that could even they call that a dead ball contact technical if they want to yeah which is two in the ball yeah now they got to go look at this again wow do our ratings go up with officials review theyre watching more TV than anybody at home the ball was not in play Ron Gro had not handed the ball to Auburn and I think he was Chad Baker Mazar was reacting he thought that he got grabbed and you can see Cs telling Bruce Pearl I was trying to get my position but you know theres no way he dropped that Music Applause shoulder and now the explanation being given to John shy it does not look like there is going to be a call on the play thats interesting and you can see Shys reaction that is really interesting so Baker Mazzara may have gotten away you know with one or maybe two things in the last couple of minutes no call on each of them first the first one was nothing yeah the second one was a foul here he is swinging it to broom whos fouled by James a good action run by Auburn and when Baker mazara got into the lane drew the defense I dont understand what is going on like everybody needs to just get to their own huddle every every team huddles up like its a football game after a foul it it all started after that scrap for the loose ball just 15 or 20 seconds of game time ago and now weve had three kind of little situations in a row but cooler heads prevail and room is at the line two shots can nipple into the game for Duke Evans will sit its been a very quiet night for Khan kiple just two points one for two from the field hes been guarded very well theyve not given him any open opportunities and two big free throws for Janai broom and Auburn going to keep the full court pressure on theyre face guarding up front Duke may be able to throw over the top against this at some point James gets it over defended by Jones does flag come get a touch proor behind the back turn around got it what a season Tyrese Proctor is having normally a catch and shoot guy a point guard in his first two years but now playing off the ball that was a big time play and Baker mazara is going to go to the free throw line and that Dan thats what I think Auburn needs to start doing more of is just driving some of these matchups spread him out and drive them but Proctor little hesitation move behind his back and then pivoting that is not an easy shot and heres the foul on Baker Mazzara going in kiple gave him a little Applause bump and Baker Mazar a good free throw shooter just under Music Applause Music 90 still a lot of time 248 to go sixpoint game Denver Jones just walked over to each of his four teammates including Baker mazara whos on the line and obviously had something he felt was very important to tell him before this next free throw fivepoint game and now Bruce Pearl wants a Applause timeout 7772 here at camon were back in 30 action yeah he can take on those switches and I think thats Dukes best opportunity to get the ball in his hands and let him make a play itll be seon James to inbound it for the Blue Devils gets it into flag and now again James and flag will combine to calmly bring it over the timeline 240 to go can nipple well defended by Johnson now flag back door cut James what a block janii broom got it James essentially took it to the shot Blocker on the other side of the basket what a block by Janai broom averaging better than three per game third in the nation and the three for broom is in and out Bruce Pearl does not mind that shot inside two minutes to Applause Music Applause Music go Proctor shed his Defender for a moment Kelly recovers its loose and it belongs to the Tigers this is a big possession here Auburn needs a bucket Jones on the drive tried to go one on two and paid the price as its knocked out of bounds oh Cooper flag was there but a great recovery got past Theon James flag there to try to block it but James recovered as well to knock it away so Auburn ball with 16 on the shot clock Baker mazara a very tough pullup and its down to James and Duke can take its time Music here and the ball in the hands of the 17yearold freshman Cooper flag now kiple just musling Baker Mazar under the bucket and he lays it Music in Jones Short on the three but off the fingertips of flag and back to Auburn that was an airball flag just couldnt Corral it but they they reset the shot clock to 20 but I dont think that ever hit the rim so whatever was on the clock there it should Music Applause stay one of the officials looking at it right now to reset the clock but it never hit the never hit the rim so there shouldnt have been a reset to 20 Applause Music itll be around 20 anyway Applause yeah Ron Gro gives a thumbs up ready to Applause go Auburn likes to lob it up to Chad Baker mazara here and then what I think you may see is a quick screen for Janai broom broom a touch cant hit it what a rebound Jones finds Baker mazara its a fivepoint game what a rebound by Denver Jones that was a big time play and still gets it to Baker mazara that was huge and now a lot of pressure the trap on Proctor and James and flag get it over again they have no choice now but the foul and put them on the line if they cant come up with a quick steal but if youre going to foul youd want to foul seon James there but watch this rebound by Denver Jones thats a huge rebound and a great pass to Chad Baker mazara for the lefthanded layup what a play flag at the line two shots coming five for8 tonight and 71 on the season entering this game Applause an intense game tonight here in Durham well played on both sides Applause two big free throws for Cooper flag peder to step back three not there broom dribbles it out broom the catch and the lay to make it a fivepoint game down to 154 seconds to go as Bruce Pearl uses his last timeout and right now its just about inbounding the ball cleanly being strong with it and expecting contact we alluded to it a little bit earlier Jay take us through it Cooper flag here in the second half well Cooper flag is just so good with the ball impacts the game on both ends gets a switch off that screen by canle in the middle and takes on the smaller toad pedford gets the bucket and the foul going against Dylan Cardwell and going right over the top it doesnt matter big small hes got so much game then going down most players would have turned that over he turns it into a lefthanded bucket Cooper flag is just a spectacular basketball player and really covers every facet of this game and he is tonights player of the game brought to you by Continental Tire in addition to the 21 Points 11 rebounds four assists three Steals and two blocks and the these are the kinds of numbers he has been putting up in so many different areas for the Blue Devils this season but really outside of all that stuff points rebounds blocks steals assist what else did he do not much really thats a great Point by you he is again against high level competition too yes he had the two turnovers at the end of the Kentucky game but he had he is off to a great start here this season for the Blue Devils and Duke has needed every bit of it here Music tonight Duke has not had a lot of experience against SEC teams in this building over the years the last time an SEC team won here was Vanderbilt in 1981 and again not a lot of teams have come here Dukes had you know the ACC Big 10 for so many years and so on but not a lot of SEC history in this building but this has been a good Applause one flag is fouled it was interesting talking to John Shire before the game about Duke versus the SEC Duke played at Arkansas last year in this event that was the first time hed ever gone to fville and he was just thinking off the top of his head he doesnt think hes been to any other SEC building yeah he said hes never been to rup he never been to Tennessee no never been to Auburn things like that I dont know its just the way the the schedule tends to fall Janai broom has fouled out of the game for the Music Applause Tigers you know Duke in in most every respect has a completely new basketball team from last year I mean Tyrese Proctor and Caleb Foster are back but just about everybody else is new and and the young players they have play Way Beyond their years especially Cooper flag its really remarkable and Malik Brown transferred in from Syracuse he was a huge factor in this game with his defense and how disruptive he could be his deflections and for really the the second time you know they went against an outstanding rebounding team and out rebounded that team they did it against Arizona and mcale and did it in this game against armor two possession game but the seconds are ticking away they need a three they need it fast instead its going to be a pass inside and a block by flag and whats the call everybody kind of looking around what was the whistle for I think they called was it a go did they call it and theyre going to look at it right now inside maybe they thought it hit the backboard but it looked like it was a Goen Applause call yeah I think it did hit the backboard Music first yeah so that should be a basket for for the Tigers but itll still I mean thats something but they really needed a three only 37 seconds to go and Duke on the verge of a a big win here tonight over the number two team of the country the Auburn Tigers who had been playing as well as anybody in the country in the early going this season right now with Duke inbounding the ball on the Baseline they can run the Baseline you know this may be an opportunity to look long against this Auburn fresher to seal this game and some more time put back on as well so from 37 its gone to Music Music 52 again Kansas number one they lost at kraton and number two Auburn on the ropes to say the least with just 5 Seconds to go into canle theres the foul 35 to go and two free throws Applause Music coming and thatll seal it boy Dukes defense in this game against an outstanding Auburn team I mean Auburn has played as well if not better than any team in the country to start this season and Duke really put pressure on Auburn made it really difficult for the Tigers to run clean offense after the first five or six minutes of the game broom wound up with 20 and 12 in this game before fouling out and it would not be a surprise to see both of these teams in San Antonio thats how good they are Music thats going to do it what a game two of the best teams in the country and Duke defeats Auburn 8478 to knock the Tigers
