Music immediately did adjustment by Syracuse they start bringing the wings up that is really because Notre Dame wants to run ball screens with their guards up top shot clock counted two Ryan fires and connect Notre Dame is a team that lives and dies by the three that was the first of many attempts tonight for the Irish Edwards rolls around doesnt drop thank you Applause transition three Works Off the Mark Chris Bell the rebound thats what Jim behind wants the Freshman to do more of hands off for Gerard goes right to the rim nice defense by Cormac Ryan Brad good job to hold down and both teams transition defense is going to be key both teams like to get out in transition and Gary break in particular particular uh Notre Dame and Syracuse like to get trailers for threes from the corner now too much on it oh both teams not shy from three they just cant find the bottom attack their zone is going to be key now they have games Goodwin at the foul line got a good look there Music Jay we have the Syracuse Virginia game Virginia put a guard like Notre Dame did Dane Goodwin but at the foul line area but this was a concern for Mike gray and Notre Dame Jesse Edwards uh his size and that right there on the offensive glass he said that was key number one we must do a good job teaching Jesse Edwards off the offensive glass offensive rebound Goodwin keeps it alive for Notre Dame to the high post shoot heres Starling extra pass to works and he ties it at five thats right by Notre Dame cant do it any better Music we welcome those who just watched that Thriller between Clemson and Duke the Tigers continue to be the story of the ACC 70 for the first time in program history and Conference play Malcolm Huckabee Jay alter with you at Syracuse you didnt miss much 55 Syracuse or Notre Dame two teams that one in the midweek and now trying to string something together for you they played six weeks ago in South Bend Syracuse won that game 6261 we expect another very close game here tonight up ahead Goodwin their runner for an easy scoop to the hoop and great transition offense thats something uh head coach Mike Bray said look we got to be opportunistic when we get defensive rebounds get out in transition before that zone can get set up thats a great opportunity right there good uh fast Court beautiful look inside Jesse Edwards all alone for the easy slam now that continues to be the problem area uh Jesse Edwards Mike gray and staff know uh theyre going to have to keep him out of the paint if he catches it with two feet in the paint hes going to either score or get fouled excellent offense by Syracuse Starly deep free Way Off the Mark playing in the dome for the first time grew up 12 miles away in Baldwinsville got a lot of friends and family here put way too much on that shot Goodwin steals it away Danny Williams lost the handle Music foreign Music offense by Notre Dame just unable to finish that time works but Gerard three Falls to Edwards Second Chance Gerard pulls the trigger again this time connects Applause but Jesse Edwards set a beautiful screen that time off the second chance opportunity and you dont often talk about it but Jesse Edwards does that often in particular for Joseph Gerard thats a beautiful screen by the big fella right now Gerard leading the ACC and scoring when you look at conference games 22 points a game Dane Goodwin answers with a three of his own to tie it at 10 and thats what Mike Bray and staff want to do get the ball below the foul line of that time all on the wing theyre executing early against the Zone Notre Dame gets some high quality looks Bell lines up with three and knocks it down backtoback triples for the orange Applause after a slow start offensively both teams starting to heat up poor Mac Ryan continues the hot streak and were tied at 13 and they continue to tack it at the high post now the adjustment for Syracuse theyre bringing Jesse Edwards up to cover whoever it is at the foul line but Notre Dame counters with a quick pass to the win uh you cant run your zone offense any better thats twice now Notre Dame with some pretty look from Beyond The Arc these teams have combined for four straight makes defense pull up pop fading away too much on it we have played seven straight minutes without a whistle Dane Goodwin cant leave him open hell make you pay and Jim Boeheim finally takes a timeout Notre Dame theyve made three straight and the threes are reigning in Syracuse Joseph Gerard with the rub screen right now youre right it is reigning threes in the dome Music Jim Boeheim and Mike Bray have been battling each other on the sidelines for a long time Bray at Notre Dame for the last 23 years Jim Boeheim obviously here at Syracuse for 47 this is their 31st meeting bayheim leads the alltime series 20 to 10 but so impressive with those two men have done at their respective schools too the longest tenured coaches in the ACC and when you took take a look at winning as to active ACC coaches theyre both in the top four well you dont stick around that long if youre not winning so thats a pretty obvious thing right there too the best really enjoyed uh speaking with both these coaches battling inside Edwards through contact finally Malik Brown puts it home with emphasis what a spark Brown has been off the bench for Syracuse last two games averaging a double double his first touch of the ball is a slam dunk X Factor and his production in particular right there uh on the offensive glass thats huge Marcus Hamm and clients the Dome with a three Notre Dame we told you they are going to live and die by the three theyve now made three in a row five of their last six from deep and its how theyre getting them this quality looks awful excellent ball movement Joe Gerard foul hell head to the line for two and well step aside again triple header on the ACC Network were just getting started in Syracuse but they are currently ranked seventh in the country they play in the dome tomorrow 2 pm on acc Network watch out though the Syracuse women they have won three straight match up right here on acc Network tomorrow at two malcol Huckabee Jay alter with you a wild day in the ACC concludes here in Syracuse New York Clemson moving on to 70 in conference play who could have predicted that preseason Hawk Brad Brown now I tell you what he believed in that group right there and they are just calling uh excellent job by him and his staff and thats a huge win at home uh versus a very good Duke team two made free throws for Joe Gerard makes it a one possession game just under 12 minutes left to this first half Notre Dame has made their last four shots they started ice cold especially for three they were all in their first six now theyve made five of six going inside the freshman then Alan Lube in great positioning for the easy Lane its all about the passing you cannot pass it any better that time Jesse Edwards theyre stepping him up to cover the foul line but again the Quick Pass uh you cannot draw it up any better excellent zone offense by Notre Dame move in a big piece Off the Bench hes missed the last two games with an ankle injury so good to see him back five seconds to shoot Bell rattles it in Chris Bell hes a sharpshooter weve seen it a couple times tonight and hes got great elevation that time on the pullup jumper broken down play he just went down Baseline and elevated up over to Defender good way ashes in Notre Dames now made six straight oh theyre brinkly down in several ways that time foul line uh theyve done it down low to the big and then theyve kicked it out to the wing theyre attacking it different ways something that coach bayheim and staff talked about Notre Dame they are very good passing teams the concern coming into this one inside to Edwards passes through the double team and Malik Brown and easy layin hes getting Great Looks through the opening 10 minutes of this game and theyre cashing in on them Syracuse has made three straight Notre Dame six straight right sure both coaches Bray and bayheim are thinking could somebody get a stop saying some eye a level offensive attacks on both teams thats a pretty good look for Notre Dame Brown rips it away from Lubin Here Comes Joe Gerard right into Goodwin off the window and in to tie it at 23 3 Applause substitution is in the game for the Fighting Irish number one JJ JJ Starling his name is Jackie back in for the Irish next Saturday college basketball doubleheader right here on acc Network it starts three oclock with Florida State in Pittsburgh and then its to the dean Dome Caleb love in North Carolina hosting turquoia Smith at NC State great afternoon of college oops its got a lot to live up to this Saturday was loaded in the ACC so many great games and hopefully the best one here in Syracuse tied at 23 Great pass lube and fouled on his way to the rim Bell The Freshman not happy with it thats another beautiful offensive this time works nice little dump off bass theyve got uh Syracuse spread out within the zone and then theyre finding all the holes foreign you know you might look at the Notre Dame ACC record one and five and say Mike Brays team living up to standard hed be the first Italian s but they got their first win in the midweek and just getting the weight off their shoulders finally you get that first ACC win how do you continue the build as Juda mens counting plus the foul uh number one JJ starling phone number two well when I asked assistant coach Jerry McNamara if Vince reminds him of anybody he immediately said hes got a little Johnny Flynn in him and that right there difficult Im not sure he was looking at The Rim uh great upper body strength down time through contact to finish off the glass its a big time play by The Freshman through the Mets completes the threepoint play fires Syracuse back in front by two Applause in trouble with five seconds on the shot clock starling gives it up to Lubin slams it home with under one second left on the timer uh these two freshman guards uh we talked about an ended tip of JJ Starling Judah mentz going at at that time Starling with a beautiful nolook pass with the shot clock winding down Gerard off the screen Ryan got a tip now startling through traffic draws the foul Syracuse final at number one Malik Brown talked about the scoring of both these freshman guards I think the bigger thing for both of them theyre playmaker I think thats so important and its going to be key as they continue to get deeper into ACC conference play uh both these guys their ability to score thats not question I think the key is their progression as point guards and play makers for their teammates I think thats going to be key for both teams Music Notre Dame ten made baskets off nine assists the passing has been on point for the Irish five seconds to shoot Starling fading away cant connect and itll say Notre Dame ball when we come back tied at 26 it is ACC battle well the Pressman uh JJ Starling beautiful dump off past the Lubin rocking the rim uh we got a tight one early on keep it going and a lot of times in games it comes down to that right there uh your fire are you going to play with energy it has nothing to do with xs and os Mike gray talked to us about that he said look I didnt have to say anything in that huddle he lit into guys they got that message and I think his speech was huge and carrying them into that overtime win for Matt Ryan part of a core of grad students that came back for their Fifth and final year to make a run in the ACC to qualify for the NCAA tournament theyre well below that standard right now but that quarterback Ryans speech of Notre Dame does go on a run Mike Grayson we will look at that moment down seven with 3 30 left to win that game maybe that can be the moment that the clings to me and he immediately came hey how are we going to break down this Zone did you see uh his speech into huddle and a lot of times coaches look your leaders and they have a lot of them on this team somebodys got to step up and uh check guys and thats exactly what quarterback Ryan did in that situation they received his message well and certainly was key for them winning that game behind the back pass leads to a Taylor three Off the Mark thank you stuck at 26 a piece and you know Syracuse has made a nice adjustment now you see you see Jesse Edwards is up playing the foul line uh before and pass hes laid back now theyre coming up and taking away that fouli pass or at least having him up there on the couch Starling contested Samir Torrance all over the freshman whos only 04 left on the shot clock this is a great individual defensive effort right here again keeping uh their star freshman guard out of the lane what can you do here if youre Notre Dame which is four tenths of a second left on the timer its going to have to be a really quick cancer treatment Im not even sure they have time or a lob Edwards so Flex it thats a shot clock violation Torrance wishes he could have taken that all the way to the rim the orange at a scoring ground of two minutes and 31 seconds the Hall of Famer into the game trying to figure out why that play was blown then when it was Edwards it deflected it number 11 Joe Gerard heres Taylor right to the rim lost the handle there to clean up the spill Jesse Edwards I think Syracuse needs to go uh whether its him on the offensive glass or try to get him isolated and let him use his size advantage thats his great work though by Jesse Edwards on the offensive glass thank you now its Notre Dame at a scoring ground of nearly three minutes Hammond trying to end it and he does from Deep Marcus Hammond fires the Irish back in front and this is why Notre Dames Danger ous lineup right here you have all five guys that can knock down threes battle for the rebound Syracuse keeps it Notre Dame in zone I still think you can post Jesse Edwards out of this situation rolling down off a high screen and then try to get an isolated down low on the Block thats it now called on Starling Mike gray switching to the Zone do you want to play zone against Jim Boeheim I mean they see this thing all day every day and they do but I think a lot of it has to do with Jesse Edwards has some help so hes not isolated down low against Jesse Edwards all right whats up Music Edwards acrobatic changed the point of release in the air and thats I think what Syracuse needs more of let Jesse Edwards set his screen and then dive him to the post you can throw it up for a lob that time though nice bounce pass and let him go up and finish with his length oh yeah steps into that it is found right now the Irish shooting 55 and down by one the ball movement uh weve seen high level uh offense by both teams on that last possession that kind of uh sums up how Notre Dame has attacked his own excellent ball movement they had the ball inside the paint kicked it out swung it around or they are not holding on to the ball foreign well everybody in the ACC knows theyve got amazing fans and ACC Network wants to see your experience each sport from your perspective snap a pick take a video tag it with hashtag all the devotion posted on social media you might just see it right here on acc Network going through some threequarter quarter pressure wanted to do give them multiple looks now theyll drop back into their zones whats up Mike gray throwing a lot of wrinkles trying to slow down this Syracuse offense shoot Edwards off to mince has to go up with it and does great defense from Notre Dame Applause this game was 6261 Syracuse won at South Bend six weeks ago weve got a lot more scoring today right on cue Trey wurtz buries a three and we are on Pace to shoot way past a 6261 finish and thats a Notre Dame 73 wow oh my goodness some of them have been almost by the S and the orange can answer Chris Bell Jim behheim told us yesterday pure shot one of the best weve ever seen in 47 years at Syracuse hes shown it off tonight I praise both bayheim has seen a lot of great fears come through here and uh hes got a pure stroke Edward skies for the rebound three minutes left to this first half offensive explosion between these two teams Gerard splits the double team in traffic kick down mince a three and connect thats a heads up play that time by luceski dude he couldnt grab it but tipped it to his teammate works and good look though bye all set up by Joseph Gerard all alone Notre Dame is made threes in this first half we saw them and shoot around uh doing exactly that they said we have to get it below of the free throw line whether its in the corner or short Corner they are picking this Zone apart Applause hes been all about the threes tonight Chris Bell The Freshman knocks one down here but Notre Dame theyve got eight triples and a fourpoint lead Music putting 57 in this first half huh the passing has been on point right here below the free throw line uh the wings are extended for Syracuse uh theyre kicking it out of course high percentage shots uh you said it eight of 15 uh from the threepoint line over 50 up for them uh in this first half thus far and I think its the quality of looks that theyve had thats been impressive coach Bray must be happy without his team is executing Notre Dame fans know this team lives and dies by the three and tonight the Irish living good at Syracuse eight made threes 53 from Deep Im starting to think its the basket though because while we were away some dude just banked in a half court shot to win 10 grand on the basket the Notre Dame shooting casually walked out of here with a uh Happy Gilmore size check for 10 grand casually as you said a knock down a half court three Applause following number 14 made I think though going back to that last position there for Syracuse okay they need to do more of that that was a set play to try to get Jesse Edwards uh posted if Notre Dames gonna play man Id almost just isolate him get him into post let him get a paint touch ES Bell fires contested look and he drills it Chris Bell his third three of this first half so much for my strategy just Tee It Up shoot a deep contested three forget about the post game in this one right here threes are reigning all over for both these teams all right back and forth we go our ACC nightcap and its an offensive explosion Applause misses that one but Notre Dame still eight of three in this first half the orange looking for the lead with a little more than a minute left to this first half Gerard pull up pop cant stick it block out that time by luceski keeping Jesse Edwards off the offensive glass nothing but the bottom of the net nine made threes in this first half for Notre Dame on are deep and the shot clock but where hes shooting that one right there almost on the S and that thing did not touch the rim at all Gerard trying to answer cant 49 seconds left for Notre Dame and Mike gray takes his use it or lose it time out here well take you with them stepping aside for 30 seconds one final play at the end of this first half well this is the type of night it has been for Notre Dame you can shoot from just about anywhere and its gonna find the bottom of the net and the key to that was the ball fake by Nate lishevski that got the defense moving and then he kicked it right back to Works five seconds ago and the Irish add one more bucket foul called good strategy for Jim Davis plenty of fouls to give at the end of this first half that was only their fourth point one seconds left the key to this one you do not want to file a threepoint shooter in the act Accords contested by Williams falls off the rim no good but Notre Dame a team that only scored 61 in South Bend against the orange six weeks ago 40 in that first half an offensive explosions first half a pinpoint passing and then they got high quality looks from Beyond The Arc Notre Dame shot 54 percent in that first half you take a look at Syracuse backcourt Joseph Gerard and Jude immense they have led the way all season long the two leading scorers on the year they struggled in that first half only combined for 10 points in three of 13 shooting and that was a focus for Notre Dame they chased them off screens they shaded a lot of help to them I think the adjustment for Syracuse offensively uh get Jesse Edwards more involved down low on the Block and then defensively against Notre Dame their wings are going to have to adjust in that first half Notre Dame had uh way too many open looks start of this second half Notre Dame starts with a fourpoint lead and the basketball shoes allowed nine first half threes Goodwood stuck in the corner and a timeout taken burned one just 18 seconds in to the second half well step aside as well just getting going at the second half its never a wasted timeout with Mike Bray he was on the court demonstrating how to pass out of the 23 zone right on that ACC logo rarely see a head coach during the timeout open up some practice well Im sure he did not want that look right there though can a deep contested three and thats what Syracuse wants out of the zone Applause tough to inside Benny Williams cuts the lead in half all right Bob Syracuse Im letting Jesse Edwards touch the ball every offensive possession zoner man against Notre Dame uh run your offense through him if they come and double hell let him pass out of him like he did Nate lasheski buries it from the corner handmade threes for the Irish now coach behind not happy again to Wings its all set up if they come up high what Notre Dame is doing is theyre getting the ball to the wing not holding and then immediately getting it to the corner Williams Off the Mark youre Starling bursted speed jams it down JJ Starling hammers it home and now a whistle after take another look well Im not sure what theyre calling but JJ Starlin showing off the Hops my goodness elbow in the rim and that is a big time move uh by The Freshman for Notre Dame Applause Im an immediate timeout giving an earful to Benny Williams on the bench as Malik Brown checks in for the sophomore Notre Dame Now with an eightpoint lead its their largest of the game okay inside Edwards triple teams passes out of it finds mids two seconds to shoot back to Edwards and he hammers it home with less than a second left on the shot clock theyll take a look I think he got it off yeah I think he did Justin the Nick a Time heads up Plato by Jude events well lets take a look again two feet in the paint a good offense by Syracuse his triple team passed back out and then Mitch could have easily force that up yeah I think he might have just gotten that off tough to tell if the buzzer went off ignore the bottom left yeah I think he did got it off with less than two tenths of a second count the dunk were getting some great Sports Center top 10 nominees in this game Starling and then Edwards answers where the grown mans Jam of his own and I think thats great Patience by Syracuse again a run your offense through Jesse Edwards I sound like a broken record but thats to match up that favors you right now Applause Music Zurich is really pressing those forwards up trying to deny Notre Dame clear shooting from the threepoint Arc theyve made ten Edwards got a piece of the Starling floater Chris bell went down humbles back and now readjusting his shoe Edwards misses Music pretty good look though for Edwards good win great pump fake scoop to the hoop Dane Goodwin hes so crafty Silent Assassin thats what I call him he doesnt say much hes a quiet leader oh thats a crafty move by the veteran and a great body control by Dane Goodman and they continue to attack it from the foul line Notre Dame the Syracuse Zone Brown count it plus the foul foreign Applause is key for Syracuse thats a beautiful dime uh by the freshman judaments the last two games Malik Brown averaging a double double Jim behind praising him this week he just says he does his job on both ends gets rebounds does not leave that block makes his layups does very well at the bottom of this 23 Zone and hes earned more and more playing time it up and drills it Nate lasheski his third three of the night now uh you have to make a decision you gotta guard all five out on the perimeter that rims out but well stay with Syracuse the orange trailing by eight how do they answer because right now Mike Bray and Notre Dame starting to separate themselves well I think again youve got to continue to be patient uh offensively uh Jesse Edwards has been I think a good solution for you but defensively the wings are going to have to adjust and get out on all the threepoint shooters judamids just three points one of five shootings they need the Freshman to get going as Syracuse trailing by eight foreign right here this is great A zone offense all set up by the Cutters Cormac Ryan draws the defense in and because they have five guys out on the perimeter that can knock down threes a very very difficult matchup against this zone of Syracuse that was Nate lasheskys third triple of the night Notre Dame as a team have connected on 11 threes this he struggled and it continues just one of six from the floor quickly the other way everything but the Finish great recovery by the orange I pray he thought there was a foul on that play theres a foul on that play the lob to Edwards shoved from behind Jesse Edwards by the way as reported his eighth double double of the season thats a nice pass by Joseph Gerard off the roll and again I like how theyre getting a Jesse Edwards uh to the basket dont just post them uh roll them off a screen but try to get him in the paint its 10 points 11 rebounds for Syracuse tonight but trailing by eight great side to the Freshman Lubin great ball movement Goodwin open in the corner and he makes Syracuse pay again nothing but the bottom of the net for Dane Goodwin well if you want to show how to move the ball on the perimeter show that last possession inside outside balls one left to right extra pass for a wide open Corner three Edwards contested look but Malik Brown in perfect position to get a touch thank you Applause of Syracuse desperate for a stop ball every Thursday night womens basketball takes over the ACC Network this coming Thursday Miami NC State at six and the doubleheader is a rivalry game Duke North Carolina top 25 matchup right here on the ACC Network now the Notre Dame lead is nine the Irish have connected on 12 threes in this game and by Brown Gerard has it for Syracuse through traffic trying to do too much and he lost it Applause just rotating guys in and out of that foul line area Applause thats probably one of their worst offensive possession not much ball movement that time and a quick three Edwards lost the handle and thats a turnover Applause Syracuse wanted to go inside because Notre Dame lacks that big man defensively you said on the offensive end its an asset not to have that big man camped out on the Block they can spread you have five Shooters wide yeah luccheski again when they slide and play this lineup right here all Five Guys a high percentage threepoint shooters Applause look great job on the other end Jay that last possession as Jesse Edwards is going to get a break I think yeah that was a fatigue again thats a great position he has two feet in the paint but I think because hes chasing so much out of the Zone covering the foul line trying to get out on suitors uh he is uh used a lot of energy format catch and shoot too much on it Justin Taylor nabs the rebound for the orange hes a sharpshooter for Syracuse we havent seen much of tonight Gerard loses it thats now three turnovers and quick succession for Syracuse and Gerard stays down this is five on four for Notre Dame Gerard really slow to his feet as wurtz makes the orange pay Gerard now heading over to the Syracuse bench I think he may have banged his chin or on top with his head afterwards I think the fall uh yeah right there Cormac Ryan came right down on top of him and thats a pretty good Music apparently theyre gonna need him close out this game to try to get back in mens right to the rim all right a chance to complete the threepoint play from the line okay hes just got a different gear right here explosion and then weve seen him do this uh time and time again we have had the Virginia game his ability uh to get past guys and then play through contact big reason why hes one of the top scoring president uh in college basketball Applause that so did this Syracuse team the fans coming to life a Saturday night in the dome in Syracuse from double digit down in the second half called on Hima inside Music his first team call number two Applause four seconds to shoot Hammond hes a three and hits it Marcus Hammond dials it in from deep and Notre Dame back up by 12 my goodness they are shooting the three uh they are lacing it thats 14 made threes in this game 52 for the game for Notre Dame foreign with a lot more confidence after that win in the midweek finally got that first ACC win and theyve taken it on the road a 12 point Notre Dame lead with Under 12 minutes left in regulations Music Malcolm theyre living good 19 assists in this game 14 made threes its been a thing of beauty to watch them swing the ball left to right extra pass and theyve gotten high quality looks uh time and time in this game off of excellent ball movement Mike Bray told us earlier today he feels his team plays best when their backs are against the wall they were against the wall against Michigan State earlier this season they win that game by 18 they certainly were against the wall against Georgia Tech youre all in five at ACC play you win that game now this team has some confidence an opportunity to close out this game winning by 12 and maybe string together some wins at ACC play Notre Dame is a dangerous team because of this right here they have Five Guys on the court when they go with that lineup of the chesky at the five okay theyre very difficult to match up against him what adjustments can Jim behind make defensively and maybe this is it full court pressure after the TaylorMade I like this change up it feels like Notre Dame they were in their comfort zone uh they got to take them out of the comfort zone and I think the biggest adjustment now how the Wings play uh in particular trying to guard the wing and Baseline thats going to be key for the Syracuse Zone try five seconds to shoot heres starling Runner off the front rim no good Applause Taylor feet inside Brown count it plus the foul its all set up beautiful pass by Justin Taylor right here faked like he was going to shoot that coming off the screen and then body control eyes on the rim the entire time take that hard hit that dead finish beautiful offense by Syracuse with Joe Gerard on the bench Jim daheim has Four Freshmen on the court right now they are spurring the orange to life theyve cut the lead to seven Syracuse has made their last four shots Notre Dame breaks the full court press words wide open three missed it Applause Taylor has a step everything but the Finish foreign for Justin Taylor all the way up ahead Hammond and that rolls in such a beautiful finish tough break though for Syracuse Taylor had everything except the bucket and then Hammond with the Beautiful Finish and thats a critical fourpoint swing Applause Edwards heads to check in the orange FEMA foreign pressure even though Notre Dames been breaking it with these backtoback buckets for Marcus Hammond theyre making this press break look easy and Hammond doing a nice job using his body uh that time uh fending off uh Brown again great press break against the Syracuse team is huge way too much on it from Judah Mintz offensive rebound kick out Bell he buries it foreign Bell drills his fourth three of the night 16second chance points for Syracuse and the Dome has come alive of the change to go to the full court pressure has changed the momentum of this game Applause thats a career high for the Freshman Chris Bell foreign to get it in finally they do with starling eight seconds to shoot darling to quiet the crowd he missed it foreign Justin Taylor cuts the lead in half its a threepoint game timeout Mike pray you cannot execute any better right here Juda mens with the little dribble handoff The Freshman to freshman Taylor raising up and the Dome is on fire right now the JayZ change up to go to full court pressure uh by Jim behind changed the complexion of this game uh theyre back into it defensively is what started it and then offensively theyve had a three or four great possessions to bring this thing right back down to a threepoint ball game Notre Dame led by 12 now the Irish lead is down to three and Syracuse has trimmed that lead all with Joseph Gerard on the bench Jim behind running with Four Freshmen one of them Justin Taylor who made that big three he he could pass for Jim behinds third son looks just like buddy and Jimmy well they found another good one and uh this freshman class and the Hall of Famer rides this line up Four Freshmen on the floor Goodwin wide open for three and those looks were falling all night long but now the crowds into it Syracuse with the momentum and its funny of players who have made those looks all night then start to missile offense offense Jim behind live Music he feels like it was a flop on to Jesse Edwards screen Applause Notre Dames had good looks the last two possessions and as you said they were falling earlier but Dane Goodwin that last possession thats a wide open three yeah Goodwin another good look Edwards got a piece of it great closeout from Jesse Edwards stay Notre Dame ball five seconds left on the shot clock when we come back what a fun finish weve got coming at Syracuse one possession game Applause led by their freshmen are on a 134 run and its been a plays like this right here Second Chance opportunity Syracuse 16second chance points Pressman to freshman right here Justin Taylor with the beautiful pullup off the dribble handoff and just like that we got a threepoint game its a loaded freshman class and Jim behan told us yesterday in our meeting with him theyve gotten better and better you can see the Improvement each practice each game and now in a big moment freshmen are starting to step up and you can depend on them down the stretch and uh we spoke to them uh before the Virginia game this was kind of a theme you saw of the minutes going up with some of these young players Cormac Ryan well short thats an air ball foreign has all started because Syracuse is starting to get some stops on defense Notre Dame has made 14 threes tonight but theyve missed their last four inside to Edwards lucchesky commits the foul thats his third number 14 made Im impressed as you see Jerry mcmaher talking to Drew dements of the boys of the Freshman its not that theyre scoring but its how they did it thats a patient possession right there again it would have been easy for them uh to jack up a three they recognized Notre Dame went to mantoman run your offense and go back to the matchup that was working for you and that is Jesse Edwards Edwards makes the front end of the one and one Applause again Applause that was once 12 is down to two 7 30 to play in this ACC battle Applause and watch Notre Dame they use the ball fake to try to get the Syracuse Zone moving try and drives Baseline off the front rim no good lacheski second effort through contact Nate lasheski what a huge bucket for the Irish it ends a near threeminute scoring drought this is a big time offensive rebound and put back by lucesky that time tipped it to himself and then goes right through the shot blocker Jesse Edwards that is a much needed bucket of for Notre Dame thank you Applause completes the threepoint play now a fivepoint lead for the Irish now Notre Dame throws some threequarter court pressure thats just to slow them down and now theyre dropping back into their Zone at what point do you put your art back in this game by the way theyre riding out right now I think youd go with them uh probably for the next two or three minutes yeah shove at the back on cormack Ryan he cant believe the call follow number five and thats Cormac Ryans fourth foul one more and he will have fouled out of his game Applause expect though if Joseph Gerard is fine to go back into the game the game Ill be there much longer but coach bayheim elected to ride with uh his freshman well Pete Moore Syracuse the sports information director came over and said that Gerard is cleared to come back into the game Applause now he goes over to the scores table so instead bone Joseph Gerard back in with the orange trailing by four Applause this run has been spurred on by Four Freshmen on the court without Gerard Applause foreign all the way to the rim off the window for two the Baldwinsville native with it with huge made fast there Applause these two freshman guards meant for Syracuse and JJ Starlin for Notre Dame we talked about him after fifth two of the higher scoring guards in the ACC they are putting on a show in this second half Goodwin pulls it out 10 on the timer Applause words passes out of trouble luccheski at the end of the shot clock deep it up and misses Applause timeout Jim behind each time he only has one remaining steam trailing by six good time to remind you next Saturday college basketball double header right here on acc Network Florida State and Pittsburgh tips things off at three Eastern Time and then its over to the ding dong Caleb love in North Carolina hosting NC State should be a great afternoon of basketball feels like every Saturday is absolutely wild in the ACC we have had quite a game tonight here in the dome the orange Trail by 12 of them terrific comeback effort cut it to three and now Mike Brays team is punched back which is a at times something that his team has lacked this season in ACC to play but theyre showing a big fight on the road yeah and thats something that a lot of people though coming into this season thought they would do because theyre so experienced Malik Brown rocks the rim oh full court pressure on Dome crowd behind this Syracuse team five minutes to play fourpoint game Applause career high for Malik Brown he joins fellow freshman Chris Bell with career highs tonight Applause back pedaling over to Goodwin hes off the mark Gerard back into the game for Syracuse 4 30 remaining Bell thought about the three slows things down Applause stay in their zone Great pass Brown again to back slams for the Freshman Malik Brown and its a twopoint game and both the slams were set up by Judah Mintz impacting the game with his passing ability another beautiful setup to Brown Applause and Brown getting a tip on that ball he is everywhere right now for Syracuse active hands what a boost off the bench he has been talked about his numbers over the last two games he has been huge huge for Syracuse Applause a doubledouble in the last two games bringing energy down the stretch Notre Dame clinging to a twopoint lead Applause doesnt drop better Applause for the lead its good the Orange is first lead since five minutes left in the first half Hammond how about that for an answer Marcus Hammond hes got 18 his 43 of the night quietly he has silenced this Syracuse Zone another deep three Applause means for the tie got it 2 30 to play tied at 71 for Notre Dame gets somebody to that foul line area and now you see the adjustment by Syracuse Jesse Edwards coming up to the foul line playing whoevers in there Starling in attack mode tripped up foul called Edwards stays down see him get up all tied at 71 these two teams going punch for punch down the stretch Marcus Hammond hes got a seasonhigh 18 in the orange theyve made their last four Music 71 down the stretch they come Syracuse and Notre Dame Puck not much to separate these two teams in the first 38 minutes whats going to separate them in the final two well I think for Notre Dame it comes down to what youve been doing in this game having a live look inside Mike Grays huddle tied at 71 down the stretch they come Syracuse would Notre Dame Puck not much to separate these two teams in the first 38 minutes whats going to separate them in the final two well I think for Notre Dame it comes down to what youve been doing in this game 21 assists theyve made 15 threes uh theyre going to have some type of hitter to get the ball into the paint kick it out for the threepoint Shooters Syracuse uh what got them back into this game defense theyre gonna have to contest and defend the threepoint line cant keep it in play thats a turnover Syracuse ball tied at 71 change in this game they have contested everything Joseph Gerard right here not making it easy for them to inbound thats a missed opportunity for Notre Dame out of the timeout not to get a shot off foreign Applause with a chance to give Syracuse back the lead thats a veteran move right there by the Freshman Jude immense a good straight words got him up in the air now hes on the freethrow line Applause Syracuse 72 thats been the magic number for the orange when they can hold an opponent under 72 undefeated 110 watch Notre Dame they rotate people in and out of the foul line getting in and then get somebody out and vacate it five seconds to shoot words has to hurry step back three air ball foreign Syracuse with the basketball and a onepoint lead the orange trailed by as many as 12 in this second half they have battled all the way back now how do they finish well I think uh individual police like that it starts with their defense Judah Mintz thats a great individual oneonone defensive plays shot clock winding down you fossil force of air ball from three Syracuse now has options they shot the ball well from the three uh late in the second half there I still say in this situation if Notre Dames going to go man uh try to get Jesse Edwards off a little pin down setting up a screen for either mints or Joseph Gerard and then roll him to the basket Syracuse shooting 61 in this second half election has been so high foul against lucchesky sends Edwards to the line and Jay they do exactly uh what I thought they would do Ive been impressed with their Poise again a run of Jesse Edwards off of a pin down and then dive into the post get them posted up in particular if Notre Dame is going man and they recognize it run a play and get Jesse Edwards down low on the Block and they have no choice but to follow thats great recognition by Syracuse and execution Applause Mike Frey playing offense defense with JJ Starling and Cormac Ryan Ryan with four fouls Edwards buries them both its a threepoint lead for the orange one minutes ago the domes rocking Goodwin almost lost it words for covers Notre Dames made 15 threes tonight can they tie it with a 16 no 12 seconds separating that shot clocking game clock and Mike gray saying dont Foul Play it out you cant ask for a better look Dane Goodwin got a pretty good look from the corner mince draws the foul remember six weeks ago in South Bend and Jude immense hit the gamewinner to beat the Irish now with a chance to make it a two possession game Jay I said it at the top Jude immense one of the top scoring freshman guards but Ive been more impressed with his court awareness in this game eight assists and only one turnover to me that has been the key in this run that Syracuse has had his playmaking ability and setting his teammates up for some high quality looks has been huge in this game in particular in the second half hence makes them both fivepoint game two or three here if youre Notre Dame off a good look you can pull a three up but you dont necessarily need it right now but you got to go quick Syracuse had a foul to give team hole number six Notre Dame in a scoring drown of two minutes and 43 seconds down the stretch they need a bucket in quickly Starling puts it up no good picks out Hammond rattles in and out doesnt fall Chase puts it in but with only 18 left Mike Bray calls his final time out it took too long to get that basket and Syracuse is right on the doorstep of closing out this win the wave that Notre Dame was shooting the ball in this game a really up until I think when uh Joseph Gerard got hurt and then they switched up their defense it looked like Notre Dame I was going to continue to shoot lights out but their defense I think that stretch uh when uh coach Jim Boeheim went to the full court pressure that changed the complex of the game and I talked about it of the Freshman Judah Manson This play making in the second half I think was key uh for Syracuse to come back and what looked like it was going to be a runaway train of Notre Dame shooting threes Syracuse they weathered that storm threepointers from Notre Dame at one point it really looked like the Irish couldnt miss back with a run of their own with Four Freshmen on the floor for most of it for Notre Dame youre praying that Syracuse turns this ball over time not on your side under two seconds left in regulation Syracuse can run the Baseline and they do have one time out at their disposal and if Notre Dame face guards uh they got to be careful right now if nobodys playing safety uh that Syracuse just throws it over the top it looks like it might be open for mens if theres nobody playing safety to throw it long Intimates foul immediately committed Notre Dame just praying legitimate this is both his fourth personal but with even one make judamis will ice this game for the orange and the Freshman delivers Mikey has all season again we know about his scoring uh make no mistake about it he is one of the better scoring guards but his decisionmaking an ability to playmate for his teammates uh was impressive tonight Syracuse rallies from 12 down to win this game against Notre Dame 73 Syracuse improves to 52 in ACC play with the win with their defense but their defense spurred their offense oh they have uh obviously a big time scorer and Joseph Gerard but Jesse Edwards the anchor to their defense was huge and then the Freshman Jude events uh his playmaking ability credit of coach bayheim and the work that Jerry Mack Alan Griffin and red archery dude uh with the guards uh his progression really uh its been a huge jump and his decision making Ill go back to it again eight assists only one turnover end this game was huge an orange team thats trying to
