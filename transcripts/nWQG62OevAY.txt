the season six1 in conference play The only loss was earlier this month at home against a ranked Miami team one of the stronger teams in the ACC near the top of the standings those Miami Hurricanes Tonight its Florida State the traveling black the home white and orange for the Clemson Tigers DJ Hall controls that opening tip for Clemson 187 on the season We take a look at the starting lineups brought to you by your local Toyota dealers Chase Hunter had that winning bucket two weeks ago in Tallahassee Made the free throw for the old school threepoint play and the difference in the win for the Tigers Music Paul backing his way in using the muscle He dropped that shoulder and scores the first basket Heres the starting lineups brought to you by your local Toyota dealers for the Florida State Seminals Told you about Miller getting his first start of the season with freshman Coach Hamilton wanting to get him involved more and more as the season progresses Three out of the corner for Florida State Cam Corin and off a play from Baba Miller driving to his right Little bit too much help Big time shot Corin expanding his game out at 610 Only the seventh three that hes made all season for number three in black garnet and gold Hunter on the drive against two defenders around Miller around the rim and in Thats a big time move Chase Hunter attacking the rim Hes going to need to be good Florida State the way they get up and pressure They take you out of what you do offensively You have to create some individual plays Thats where Chase Hunter can thrive Chase Hunter averages just over 14 points per game Had 15 points in the loss against North Carolina on Saturday Struggled though from threepoint distance for Hunter Just one of eight Hall wide open spaces and thats Darren Green Jr over on the weak side Great job by PJ Hall to push up and create an angle for the easy layup But that help side has to come over from the weak and Green Jeter has to be aware of where the ball is when youre two passes away PJ Hall was the leading scorer against Carolina with 18 points and seven of 13 shooting Tyson pulls that one in as one of the top rebounders in the ACC and leading the Tigers in that category Galloway in the paint Paul stepping back knocking it down You have to run it a little roll of place Scream get down there and then PJ comes up to the top of the key Keep in mind too Florida State starting two freshman at the four and the five Communication for those two is going to be crucial with all the ball screen action that Clemsons going to run But so far both teams getting what they want offensively And seven early points of the nine for Clemson for PJ Hall Shefflin over the top with a rebound after the Florida State miss Hunter wants to run trying to attack the rim and a foul is called And thats where Chase Hunters at his best But keys for this game pretty selfexplanatory Brought to you by your local Ford dealer Tight closeouts for Florida State Clemsons one of the best threepoint shooting teams in the Atlantic Coast Conference And if youre Clemson you have to handle this pressure Defensively Florida State loves to get up and take you out of what you want to do And you cant allow the Simols to get offensive rebounds as well Sometimes they struggle first shot on offense but they have so many good athletes that they can attack and still find ways to score Chase Hunter at the free throw line Red shirt junior from Atlanta Georgia 86 of the season fourth in the conference Has struggled shooting though recently for the Tigers And over the last three games 10 of 42 from the field in those three games losses Tom he is so important because he gives them a dynamic playmaking guard on this roster Hunter Tysons a really good player not going to create for himself Ian Shefflin does a nice job but hes not going to create for himself Chase Hunters that guy that can create some offense Warley All helped with defending for the Tigers Warley trying to work off of that screen set by Corin and a foul is called But why do you get that call Its when youre playing aggressive on the ball defense Guy gets a little too aggressive Offensive foul Applause Music So the officials have got to try to sort out a clock issue Lee Cassell Doug Shows and Brian OConnell are officials for this evening here in Clemson South Carolina Now theyre checking on the clock And now theyre going to take a little extra time so well step aside for just a moment The Tigers have an early 113 lead against visiting Florida State Music So the first half Florida State and Clemson second meeting this season This is what the officials went to the scorers table for after Hunters free throw You can see Terrence the clock does not move We went back They set it at 1640 but itll be Clemson basketball Shot clock will reset regardless But Clemson started off really well attacking quickly in the half court The ball is moving and popping Coach Brownells team four of four from the floor so far Like to keep that percentage going They are fifth best in the conference at 46 per game from the floor as a team Entry to Shefflin Tough catch Shefflin Chance at a threepoint play Come on Ian Shefflin A grown man move I love this set A sweeping horn set A single single ball screen coming off to your left And Brevin Galloway does a terrific job setting his feet knowing Florida State wants to front Thats Ian Shefflin right there A little under size but strong as an ax Big time finish The sophomore goes 67 230 lbs from Loganville Georgia He was tied for the team lead in rebounds with seven in the loss Saturday at North Carolina 9171 By the way expect some threepointers in this game Terrence Last time they played the teams combined for 62 threepoint attempts Thats my kind of game right there T Miller Shefflin cut off the alleyway Shot clock is deep and late Knocked away Hunter goes to the court trying to save it and a shot clock violation against the Noles Another excellent defensive possession and thats scout team work right there for Clemson But Leonard Hamilton I talked to him a little bit at shootound today Obviously injuries have derailed their season but he also acknowledged something to me that I thought was really interesting Im going to go about how I get players differently next year right Theyve been a little slower to adapt to the transfer fur There are a couple Thats one you have to have right there Tom There are a couple but this Florida State team used to a lot of length That doesnt usually happen So Galloway tried a threepointer from Fort Mill South Carolina Missed it and then ends up with two at the end of the possession Its unbelievable Clemsons energy level right now has been absolutely terrific attacking the offensive glass Darren Green Jr You got to rain that ball in then you guys can get out and run But Cludson knocking down shots and when they dont attacking the offensive glass Music So the Tigers have lost three in a row but started the ACC schedule 70 10 wins just one off the school record for wins in conference play Brad Brownell alltime winning as coach for the Tigers Worth mentioning Tom the game in Tallahassee also started out 162 in favor of Clemson Ended up as a onepoint game one of those three onepoint wins for the Tigers this season All in ACC play By the way Florida State has the conference record for onepoint wins in a season with five in the ACC Not for the faint of heart And that was last season And one of those wins was a onepoint win against Clemson So there you go See how it all comes together there Terrence Thats well done by you sir Thank you Thank you Well done Well crafted That guy that was in your picture PJ Hall Hes opened up really really well Stepping out hitting a hitting a three and then hes just so wide Hes really worked in the weight room doing a nice job posting up Florida States freshman front courts Florida State just one of four from the floor Keep in mind the Tigers have the best field goal percentage defense in all of the ACC as well Shot clock to seven Trying to work that baseline Warley had to kick it out Miller needs to shoot That did not hit the rim Thats another shot clock violation The defensive intensity for the Tigers has been impressive And youll notice theyre doing to Florida State what Florida State usually does to other team Theyre pushing catches out towards half court and its disrupting the timing of their offense And Clemson just getting out and moving playing quick Cant leave them open Missed it Paul fights for it Tried to bounce it to Shefflin and scooped up by Dylan Hunter younger brother of Chase Galloway Hunter Florida State had it well boxed out as Green boxed out Tyson Here come the Nles Clemson just finding easier shots in the half court right now Everything for Florida States contestant Corin Corin with a three Applause Thats two for the young man Hes a nice player Kim Corin does a lot of unique things for this team and thats what Leonard Hamilton told me he does Watch out PJ Hall with a rim bender for the Tigers Theyre just playing with so much pace Tom moving the basketball attacking early Rotations a half step slow so far for Florida State Tigers 12 nothing points in the paint right now after the jam by DJ all from nearby Spartanberg South Carolina So all of the points belong to Corin with a couple of threes Warley had it knocked away recovered by Mills late in the shot clock again couldnt spin it off the glass Florida States coaches drawing a foul on that one but the activity level is saving them in and of itself Florida State this is where theyre dangerous though Tom Got to get out in front Cant have live ball turnovers How about Mills Oneon two Thats what hes capable of Mills a big time scorer They had him playing the point guard position earlier this season Not sure that was really what hes best at Hes a wired to score type of guy Hes been that his entire career both at Houston and Florida State Applause Nolles are coming off a loss at home against Pit 8375 on Saturday Thats a runner from Galloway A little too strong Tried to get it back out of bounds And that will be seminal basketball 1239 to go in the first half Heres a look at the top half of those standings And coach Cable and the Panthers 12 and three in conference play They had that win on Saturday against the seminals How good have they been Coach Gables got to be ACC coach of the year at this point A tough rugged bunch up there at pit But that graphic it shows you why this game is so incredibly important for the Tigers You get that first double buy in the ACC tournament I mean it helps tremendously Pit won at home against Boston College yesterday as did Syracuse and Duke beat Notre Dame All the home teams won last night And on Monday North Carolina lost to number 15 Miami So youre up to date Shot clock down to seven Whistle goes against Florida State Mloud with the moving screen Tigers sitting on top of everything defensively right now Every time Florida State tries to run an action there is no space to be had Shefflin is out Alex Hemmonway threepoint specialist in for the Tigers 43 for his career from beyond the arc for Heid Midway Fifth in school history Applause Tyson baseline around the defender Come on A little euro Hunter Tyson Nice move Saw the seven for Mloud coming his way A shifty little side step First points for Hunter Tyson the graduate student from Monroe North Carolina Just three points and only two shot attempts in the loss to North Carolina on Saturday while going back to Clemson Well I love the ball movement It pops quick Excellent job Alex Himaway but Hunter Tyson a little scoop to do Tigers up 12 Music ACC basketball is brought to you by your local Ford dealer by the Fresh Market voted number one best supermarket in America and by ZMAX Microl Lubricant Extend engine life increase fuel mileage Available at Advanced Auto Parts Hunter Tyson being recognized for one team of all ACC and for good reason A walking double double nearly If he gets 11 today hed be awfully close And he needs a good game after only one May basket True against North Carolina They need him to be good He does so many things for this Tiger team And when youre getting pressured by Florida State its always good to have a guy like him whos got to be 35 years old at this point Hes been in college forever but good for him 1000 points Welldeserved The Monroe North Carolina native The Monroe menace if you will Has had an excellent college career I will 12 double doubles on the season And by the way hes playing in his 132nd career game Needs two to tie the school record in that regard Middlebrooks knocked it away Heres Tyson unloading Middle Brooks again determined to get to the basketball And I will say this about Ben Middlebrooks If he doesnt get the rebound hes taken about three people down with him Hunter hangs and scores Kind of player he is You see the extension the elevation on that jump shot Tom Hes that kind of athlete Explosive Jay Hunt Coach Dabo Sweeney might be watching Ben Middlebrooks at 610 242 lbs at a sophomore Remember no Coach Sweeney might be in the building somewhere Well keep our eyes open It looks like wrestling underneath Ben Middlebrooks I mean hes not the skilled guy that PJ Hall is but its always great to have somebody thats going to come in and play that aggressive on the opposing five Hes got five fouls Then Middlebrooks not scared to use it Florida State three of seven from the floor so far Thats a twisting difficult shot from Jackson Tried to keep it alive There was contact underneath Looks like Middlebrooks on that one Jaylen Jacksons a nice play Freshman from Memphis I mean hes got a big strong body The same kind of physique that Trent Forest had whenever he was here 64 200 205 lbs As he adjusts to the college game hes going to be an excellent player for Lyn Hamilton Chandler Jackson the freshman from Memphis Tennessee Thats a tough shot High degree of difficulty Knocked around Lemon way tried to feed it up ahead to Hunter Tyson They could not connect Florida State has to find a way to get an easy look And Clemson has sat on top of every offense theyve been running And then once they get in the paint theyre meeting three and four players at one time Got to find a way to get one of your guards downhill Jaylen Worley last game had 23 points and was efficient in doing so You got to find a way to get him open and get him heading towards the basket Yeah that was a careerhigh and game high in the loss at home to pit for Worley who was nine of 11 from the floor Green turns around and hits the target Green the Central Florida transfer Somebody that can create his shot but much better suited as a catch and shoot guy Aggressive move from Hunter Tyson He went for it midair contact and hes going to the free throw line Thats where hes at his best Hunter Tyson cutting away from the basketball knowing where to attack Mloud if youre going to get that dunk youre going to get your money from Tom House picked up the foul for Florida State 84 for the season seventh in the ACC Hunter Tyson from the strike Applause Exactly 10 minutes to go in our first half Tommy Terrence Oglesby the former Clemson Tiger and our outstanding ACC basketball production crew with you from Little John Coliseum home of Tiger basketball since the late 1960s Refurbished over the last few years this place is an absolute palace What a setting for ACC basketball Oh its a beautiful facility Thats for sure When I played here what 15 years ago That hurts my feelings to say that long ago 15 years now Oh it hurts It hurts It just keeps getting longer and longer and it doesnt make me feel very good They cash your check and look at look at the results right But what theyve done here you know theres obviously more potential for growth and theres going to be more growth when it comes to Clemson basketball but what a facility this is Middlebrooks just picked up his second personal foul Hes worth five of them and hes going to get every single one of them Hell come out PJ Hall comes back in Nine points for Hall And that leads everybody in scoring right now Worley angular rebound starts the break for the Tigers Tyson trying to do it himself for a moment Good patience Dont have that shot right away You move that basketball Florida States not up in the passing lanes like they typically are Tom Youre going to have chances to penetrate move the basketball swing and shoot No good for him anyway So the Tigers just under 60 shooting as a team in this first half Florida State at 36 Its been a turbulent start to this game Midway through the first half for Florida State with another miss Another contested jump shot Its been a defensive clinic so far Chase Hunter Looks like Chandler Jackson got a piece of Hunter on the way by First on Jackson We showed you at the top of the broadcast Chase Hunter and his heroics in the first meeting between these two teams a couple of weeks ago A threepoint play Basket and foul for Hunter Our first look at number 21 Chanty Wiggins 69 pretty slight of frame but somebody Tom that has a lot of potential could step out can shoot it hes listed at 205 I think thats a bit generous but as he grows into his body more he certainly has the skill to be a factor in the Atlantic Coast Conference points and three rebounds for him at North Carolina PJ Hall just hit double digits with the jumper from the corner Applause plays with such a fight and spirit for the Tigers has fought injuries to that right leg especially in the latter stages of last season The lower right leg was really a problem but he has warded that off and becoming a factor every single game for the Clemson Tigers I like that aggressiveness by Warley getting downhill playing with good pace Hes got good size Hes a really cerebral basketball player Got to find ways for him to get into the paint and make decisions Applause Miller who got the start tonight the first of his career for the freshman demanding the basketball They didnt see him the first time around Late in the shot clock Baba Miller Show me a little something Baba Miller What a move Post up Drive left Finish left First basket for Miller at one end and the first basket at the other end Chanty Wiggins said What you can do sir I can do better Chanty Wiggins nice move and pull up But you saw the potential of Baba Miller on that possession Gets the ball in the post takes his time waits for that double to go away I mean he has that kind of potential as a scorer His best game this season was that home game against the Tigers where he had 11 points for number 11 in black garnet and gold Galloway Music I dont love that shot Tom Youre moving the ball at such a good level Why would you force the issue and step back away from the defense That ball moves Clemsons been good but that guys been good too Boba Miller Hes loaded with potential and this is why Fake the guy out go left finish left Thats an NBA move right there Could have been an A1 It would 2912 our score with the Tigers leading the seminals in the latter stages of our first half of play from Little John Coliseum on a Wednesday night of the ACC Terrence lets go around the league some scores from last night as well Well a game that Duke needed to win Obviously they did Dane Goodwin went on a run of epic proportions though so that was good The big upset though is Syracuse over NC State And were like well is Syracuse really a contender to get to the big dance Tom youre happy about that Im happy about great basketball Thats what Im happy about Yeah So great basketball Syracuse get some good ones And all five starters for the Orange were in double figures in that game And Jesse Edwards had a double double Hey thats a team quite frankly Tom Just saying Yeah just saying Four freshman in the rotation Malik Browns a terrific player We had them together watching them play Virginia Tech So much potential in that lineup Now have they reached their potential No not even close I think next season this Syracuse team is going to be somebody or a team to be reckoned with up and down the Atlantic Coast Conference I think hes terrific Then we have Wake Forest at Miami on Saturday on your regional sports network 200 pm Check your local listings for the game and time in your area That should be an awesome matchup at the Watsko Center between Miami and Wake and well have it for you A massive game for Wake Forest because they dont have any quad one wins And as Ive been saying for weeks now I dont know what the net is I dont know what the metric is Im not going to try to figure it out Thats for people smarter than me But it doesnt seem to make any sense Tom It doesnt seem to make any sense Im going to put the research staff on that one for you Its unbelievable And they dont know either I can assure you Thats their only meeting this this season between Wake and Miami Again well have that for you 2 Eastern on Saturday Looking forward to that Looking forward to the rest of this one as well with Warley at the free throw line Florida State just needs to get some offensive traction here in the first half terms Yeah absolutely right And I think it comes down to if Orley is able to facilitate that offense for this team I mean a really good player a breakout candidate coming into the season but you know they have just fallen into a rut Florida State hasnt been able to play their customary 20 to 24 minutes for some of their stars because injuries have depleted their ability to play that well They turn them over Cameron Fletcher is out He he left in early December with a right knee injury to end his season Thats a big loss for this four Up and under What a move there Caleb Mills My goodness A little crafty Caleb Mills Thats a lot crafty Thats a lot crafty 25 tickets for Caleb Mills today from Asheville up the road Has a lot of family members behind the Florida State bench Hes got four points He played at the Final Four back in 2021 as a member of the Houston Cougars Second year in the Florida State program for Mills At the other end a similar move and two How about Beetle Josh Beetle Hes always been a great athlete for three That rattles out for Mills Paul came away with it Its Its been a matter of slowing down Josh Beetle And this is where you see his maturity level He is 100 mph all the time but doing a better job of handling the ball in pressure And Chase Hunter you can forget it The assist from BJ Hall I love that pass He saw the help slide over Chase Hunter camped out in the corner Forget about it Hunter hasnt missed Three for three Just made that threepointer Nine points Paul leads the way with 12 That hit the front rim The miss from Green Music How about the Tigers shooting a ridiculous 62 Beetle and that average is going up Mr Beetle playing with pace Always had that elite athleticism Needs to slow down his body just a little bit and use it selectively Excellent example of that right there Showing his growth as a player Tigers are 14 of 22 from the floor 64 Beetle had that last bucket The red shirt freshman from Columbia South Carolina Mills accelerating and missing Heres Galloway Applause Music Beetle baseline Tigers dominating in the paint 206 the first half against the NLES Punters going to pick this one up Curious to see when they were going to be a little bit more foulrone on the perimeter Clemson has been really physical on the outside If PJ Hall comes out before the last media break I like this substitution Give him an extra minute then he can close out the half By the way Hall hasnt missed a shot either Hes five for five and 12 points and four rebounds She just came out Tyson is in Shefflins in RJ Godfrey is also in the lineup for the Tigers Applause Jackson against Shefflin Trying to stay with him That will fall Soft touch So Jackson will learn a trip to the free throw line You have to love the aggressiveness Jacksons built like a defensive man and the fact that hes able to get downhill on Shefflin I thought Shefflin did a decent job moving his feet A little bit too much hip on the way up Jackson will get one more 65 215 lbs for the freshman Memphis Tennessee 67 from the free throw line on the season for Chandler Jackson That was his first field goal make of the game is one for four for Jackson and the null trying to make up the deficit the first half Hunter just beyond the free throw line I love that Thats Josh Beetle in action attacking the other guys man And what that does is I like that foul call right there Chandler Jackson getting a little too aggressive with the off arm and pushing in or pushing off rather excuse me But look at this aggressive drive Thats too much right there Pace Hunters trying to establish legal guarding position Jackson initiates the contact Offensive foul to be Clemson basketball So Jackson comes to the Florida State bench His second personal foul of the first half We now have 411 to go on our first half of play Clemsons been so good at home this season 12 and one and six and one in conference play on their home floor for the Tigers Theyll be at Louisville on Saturday A lot of dribbling from Beetle Shefflin with some daylight Triple teamed than Hunter Forget it Forget it How about Shefflin sees him coming in and Chase Hunter He steps into it like that Thats target practice for the young man A guy whos needed to play better Really in a rhythm right now And he hasnt missed tonight Hes five for five And that includes a couple of made threes for Hunter with 14 points Foul stops play with the Tigers in front of visiting Florida State And Tom this is Clemsons 2018 Sweet 16 team being honored from left to right Maris Reed Shelton Mitchell Dante Grantham and Air Sims Everybody in Clemson knows who that man is and he has gone with a different hairstyle Look at this Four guys that really impacted this program Maris Reed was an absolute bucket that season on 2018 March Madness you beat New Mexico State drilled them Auburn beat them by 40 points in the second round Ran into a Kansas team in Omaha in the Sweet 16 but that was a remarkable team And those are two guys right there that could score it You know I understand it was one of the greatest grad assistant staffs that Clemson has ever had in school history I was very appreciative to be a part of that So that thats a big point I was very appreciative I had to come back after playing eight years overseas and finish my undergrad Brad Brownell let me be a part of the staff and and be on scout team and all that I was a manager on steroids in my own mind My opinion was much more important to me than it was to anybody else But that was a really good team Elijah Thomas and a couple of other guys that could really really play Yeah The Sweet 16 for just the fourth time in school history Lets get a message from Coyote Tractor My experience if you work the land got to be a jack of all trades You got to have a little bit of optimism and a whole lot of getgo By the way that 18 team also won 11 ACC games to set the school record Should Clemson win this game tonight that would be 11 ACC wins Now we have moved on to the 20ame ACC schedule over the last couple seasons but an accomplishment any way you slice it Hunter Godfrey couldnt finish it off A lot of contact Godfrey going up not getting the call Miller maintains possession Applause Warley crossing the threeminute threshold of the first half Applause Shot clock is inside a 10 for stumbling Mills Chase Hunter Hunter Tyson lays it in Live ball turnovers will kill you And its usually the other way around Its Florida State usually forcing those things But Clemson out and running Excellent look ahead Chase Hunter to the streaking Hunter Tyson Six points for Hunter Tyson Alioop attempt And that was Mills going up top to Worley as they collaborate My goodness Mr Warley an excellent athlete at the point guard position Applause The 70 ACC start the best in school history for this Clemson program And that one lost out of bounds It is Its going to be ruled a kick against Florida State Deontay Green has come in for Florida State number five Heres the alley of connection How often you see a two guard to point guard up and away Mills throws it up Warley throws it down Teammates on the same page What a look from right behind the backboard Godfrey going for the rim Bender got knocked away at the last second Music Applause Oh my goodness Mills slams on the brakes Green launching a three ball and he rattles it home for Florida State Thats what he can do A quality shooter Darren Green Jr UCF transfer can really fill it up from deep Close to 40 for his career 39 for his career and 39 in a Florida State uniform Remarkably consistent gets it off quick Really nice player How about 79 made threes this season for Green Thats going to be a two Chase Hunter My goodness When it rains it pours Six for six on the day and 17 first half points for Chase Hunter He and Hall of the double digit scorers Hall has 12 Not in the game at the moment for the Clemson Tigers Green 79 threes third most in the conference How about Deontay Green Nice player freshman Asheville North Carolina Thought he was going to wrench it Was forced into action because of all the injuries Hes a young man with a lot of potential Inside out threat at the power forward position One basket Hes already above his season average for points in a game of 14 Trying to defend Godfrey And theres a whistle Darren Green Jr if youre going to shoot close to 40 you got to get your feet set in a hurry Look at that Runs off catches feet set pip slow finish high forget about it Darren Green Jr hes that kind of shooter Right there towards the top in ACC in the ACC with three pointers made Monsanto and Smith just ahead of him Thats three guys There is no hesitation Music The light is green Darren Green Speaking of green theres Darren Green senior also wearing number 22 He wore that as a player at George Washington Really nice man I ran into him in the hotel lobby when I had a game earlier this season in Tallahassee Somebody that obviously the best person to learn from is your father who could also play Appeared to be a lane violation there against Florida State Music RJ Godfrey has tools You look at him physically Somebody that really stands out 67 225 Id bet you to guess hes closer to 230 Just physically built Dad played in the NFL for the Cowboys for a long time From Sani Georgia I mean really put together elite tools for this level Its not often that a guy can physically come in to college basketball and compete right away Hes that kind of athlete Final seconds of our first half of play Tigers have led for the vast majority of the first 20 minutes Late foul Wow So theres 16 and 12 seconds on the game clock Thats awfully ticky tack right there after its been an exceedingly physical first half Both teams have been playing with some hands That was the first on Hunter Tyson if youre looking for a trend for Florida State in a positive direction Theyve made their last four field goal attempts And Wley is at the free throw line Got to convert now Clemson gets the last shot Look for a quick ball screen Shifflin to come up and set it Get Hunter downhill Chase Hunter falling away Comes up short And thats going to do it in the first half First miss of the day but they got the mismatch they wanted Clemson has been lights out Up 21 with Chase Hunter and PJ Hall having a terrific first half 16 points Chase Hunter 12 for Hall and as a team the Clemson Tigers shot a scorching 60 4726 as we go to two teams they are playing for the 83rd time these two programs colliding Music Applause and you see those assist numbers this year and last year Tom last season he was playing off the ball a lot Nick Honor who transferred Missou and Alamir Dolls who transferred to Satan Hall left Clemson without a returning point guard Chase Hunter had to stay in there or had to switch positions play the point and it opened up his game He blossomed with the ball in his hands and thats why youre seeing that improvement Eighth turnover of the game for Florida State as that one bounced out of bounds Hunter with the 16 points double digits for the 20th time this season PJ Hall is also a double digit scorer in this game for the Tigers Thats 19 times this season for him to get to double figures Consistent performers for the Clemson Tigers with eyes on the postseason this year Deep into the shot clock Wow what a pass Tom Unbelievable Chase Hunter putting it on a dive to Brevin Galloway who when he gets his feet set forget about it How about Galloway with 218 career threepointers Now granted this is his year of college basketball Four years at the College of Charleston and last year in the Boston College program with Earl Grant who was the former College of Charleston head coach How about Baba Miller You saw his potential posting up at the first half he just has a smoothness about his game If hes hitting that threepoint shot at 7 ft tall skys the limit for that young man playing in his 10th game in a Florida State uniform and getting his first start tonight Six points for Miller Foul is called Miller played for Real Madrids junior team A high level player European prospect count comes over Got suspended for the first 16 games of the year with the most nonsensical suspension of all time Its one of these guys Hes next in line for Leonard Hamilton as far as long athletes with skill that could shine at the next level Both of the coaches in our game are the alltime winningest coach at their respective schools Leonard Hamilton Florida State Brad Brown Lell for the Clemson Tigers On the weak side Mills tried to take it away from PJ Hall Contact Applause Mills may have stepped on the end line after getting possession of it and he did So the Tigers keep it Hunter triggers the inbounds Music Tyson Paul tried to volleyball it Somehow it came back to Hall and he laid it in How about that The second effort PJ Hall Little bit of an unorthodox inbounds play off the baseline but regardless Clemson getting all those 5050 balls so far this game Watch out Thats Corin at the business end Hall might have bumped him and he did So Hall who has 14 points in the game just picked up his second personal foul colliding with Corin who has a couple of threes in the first half for Florida State Kim Corins a talented player played at Sunrise Christian with Grady Dick Green let Hall fly on by and then hit the jumper inside the arc Grady Dick who plays at Kansas but Corin has a load of potential Big size good skill Leonard Hamilton told me his best attribute is his ability to shoot the basketball at his size What an aggressive drive by Ellen and a foul on the play Remember that the Tigers shot 60 as a team in the first half Now theyre a good shooting team right Terrence 46 on the season fifth in the ACC but 60 is otherworldly Mills on the Florida State foul his first And theyve continued to shoot the ball well Even with Alex Himmonway whos arguably their best threepoint shooter theyve still kept their percentages up at a decent clip During conference play well excuse me During conference play theyve really struggled especially over the last three games But 33 during conference play This was a Clemson team though Tom that early in the season early in the conference slate was really shooting the basketball well They won their first seven ACC games And what coach Barnell told us before the game was it just hasnt been an end to end consistent performance There have been bright spots in the threegame losing streak Thats a bright spot from the corner Nine points now for Miller Thats a three He continues to shoot the ball well from that left side of the floor But that was Caleb Mills driving the lane line and making something happen for his teammate This is Hall trying to return the favor PJ Hall My goodness PJ Hall You want to talk about improving your percentages Seven of seven on the day Three of three from three Hes got 17 points Traveling violation of the ball back to the Tigers I know Caleb Mills Look at this lane line drive Gets downhill Sees the help side coming over This is a terrific pass Shifflin a little too far in And Ba Miller starting to get comfortable on the floor It might not be dangerous this game but as the season goes on youre starting to see what kind of player Miller can truly become Just the third made three of the season for Miller And then a driving bucket for the Tigers at the other end Its now 18 points for Hunter Little too physical trying to get over that ball screen You have to You have to like the effort by Chase Hunter Too much B Second on Chase Hunter He will exit the ball game Dylan Hunter comes in for Chase Younger brother Dylan Hunter played for the U16 national team United States national team was originally a Baylor commit Wow what a defensive play Hunter Tyson hitty if you will intelligent if you want another way to say it Steals the inbounds pass and throws it off Look at this awareness Sees it coming Deflection and throws it off Warley Thats a high IQ play Thats a player whos played 132 collegiate games Thats exactly right Just two off the school record for games played And how about his game in late December at home against NC State 31 points 27 26 in the second half 15 rebounds for Hunter Tyson Both of those were careerhighs What a pass Shiplin Miller recovered defensively Green hesitation Galloway stayed with him Applause Threepoint miss from Mills Hall up ahead Tyson full speed trying to get to the rim A foul was called Green and Mills were back defensively and theyre going to assess that one to Darren Green his secondar Dont forget the Ford fast break is coming your way here in the second half Thats presented by your local Ford dealer and you want to stick around for that with Hunter Tyson at the free throw line Thats a rarity 84 of the season for Hunter Tyson seventh in the ACC You know hes been this teams goto player their emotional leader this year But its a big three of sorts when Chase Hunters playing well PJ Hunter PJ Hall excuse me is playing well And then Hunter Tyson I mean all three of those guys are capable of 20point nights depending on who theyre playing He had 27 points in a road win against Florida State a couple of weeks ago A game high for Hunter Tyson This is Miller Shefflin on his back The fake by Miller so convincing that Sheffler elevated and could not help but foul Baba Miller Its been all Tigers Its still all Tigers in the second half South Oh mercy And on the Valley Sports app Music Tigers in front of the seminals In fact the 47 points of the first half a season high for the Clemson Tigers Dont forget the double header on Saturday We start at noon Eastern Florida State the Seminals will host Austin College Thats the only meeting of the season between the two programs And then a two Wake Forest against number 15 Miami which won on the road in Carolina on Monday Wake without a midweek game Team should be rip roar and ready to go two Eastern Check your local listings for the broadcast time in your region How about Tyrie Applebee from Wake Forest I mean a guy who just signed an NIL deal with Applebees Im very happy about that That only makes so much sense You got to deal with Applebees I love it Tom Ive been Ive been calling for that all season I feel like a lot of people have Every time he hits a jumper I say hes feeling good in the neighborhood Thats right But how about that Applebee Isaiah Long Thats going to be a good one Im happy to voice over the commercial if they need any help in that regard Miller by the way the foul against Miller he was not in the act of shooting before we went to break when Shefflin was up in the air on the fake Didnt even bother to throw it up to the rim Thats where the problem is You at least have to be in the act of shooting I think he was protecting himself more than he was putting up putting it up near the rim Music Not a single scoreer in double figures for Florida State And Clemson is arriving on every catch and extremely active Now Florida State has lost five of its last six and two in a row And they have a steep uphill climb at the moment here inside Little John Coliseum Good defense initially Shefflin a little too handsy out on the perimeter Second foul on Shefflin and now his third foul So he has to leave the ball game for Coach Brownell Florida State six and nine in ACC play backtoback ACC road wins at Pit and at Notre Dame But right now this road victory seems quite distant tapped around taken back by Warley Hell make a three Hey if Jaylen Worley can develop that part of his game I mean he turns into a legitimate NBA prospect Now his games still coming together as is the rest of this Florida State roster But Im telling you Tom its not going to happen this year But if theyre able to keep their pieces intact and add a couple theyre going to be dangerous Threepointer is all net Wiggins ripping the ropes for the Tigers And hes got five And Im talking about potential That guy has potential too I mean played for Team Curry Under Armour Circuit in AAOU but hes from Georgia Went to Grayson High School same high school as Ian Shefflin But somebody with a lot of length and a lot of ability hes going to score a lot of points in a Tiger uniform Florida States last win was February 4th at Louisville 8178 Music Clemsons trying to snap a threegame losing streak all against ACC opponents North Carolina Miami and also at Boston College Hall misses close range Let me say this right now Tom This Clemson team looks like a tournament team I I mean that play not so much but guards that can handle it multiple guys that can score Theyve run into a bit of a rut But when theyre defending like they have today when theyre having this many different guys attack the rim and shoot the ball well this Tiger teams a tournament team Theres no doubt in my mind The problem is the metrics get in the way Five teams from the ACC went to the tournament a season ago Brad Barnells team was not one of them Heres the resume 187 and it appears that they are on their way to 197 and 114 in conference play And that quad one portion is important sure but two quad one wins Thats a good thing But the problem is is they have two quad four losses The early season loss to South Carolina which coach Brownell has told me we played them too early PJ Hall was on a minutes restriction that game The loss against Leyola Chicago theres no excuse for that one but that was a game where everything went ice cold the metrics to me Tom its its driving me a little bit crazy simply because you have to win by certain amounts of points in order to improve Just win baby Last time Clips played Florida State in Tallahassee win by one point dropped three spots You tell me how that makes any sense And I think the Tigers would like to point to January 14th when they won against then number 24 Duke on this floor 7264 Brad Barnells 400th career win as a head coach Tyson maybe a knockout punch Chase Hunters vision though is whats so impressive Hes up at the lane line extended tries to look in the in the post but just has such good vision out of the corner of his eye Sees Hunter Tyson over there camped out ready to shoot it He gets his feet set Forget it That ones deep Look at Green shooting from Memorial Stadium Music Hunter wants to slow it down a little bit Hunter Tyson by the way to double digits for the 23rd time this season He now has 10 Sizable lead for the Tigers trying to improve upon it and it rims out Havent heard a lot from Mloud tonight for Florida State Cant miss him at 74 inside and Hunter Tyson trying to guard him Thats Miller and a three from the corner My goodness Maybe he just needed to start How about Miller acting different Hes been the bright spot for this Florida State team 12 points on four of six shooting three of four 7 ft tall Theres a lot to like 12 points is a season high Had 11 in the first meeting against Clemson in Tallahassee Mills Applause You see Leonard Hamilton arms outstretch looking for a call That does not happen The numbers for the Tigers are robust 57 as a team from eight of 18 on threepoint tries Paul wants another three And hes got it Put it in the bank for PJ Hall Man how good is that Drive baseline Force rotations Corner pocket One more up to PJ Hall who has been lights out today 20 or more points for the eighth time this season Tyson pulls out a board Tyson is fourth in the conference Almost 10 rebounds per game He now has six Hall Tough catch on the entry over Mloud Mloud runs the floor And that right there might be the Florida State Knight in a nutshell My goodness Raheem Mloud youre 74 That needs to be a dunk Forget a lefthanded layup Make that easy Mloud has not scored tonight Has just one board Tell you what PJ Hall looks exhausted And a turnover scooped up by Worley Offensive foul Position for Hunter Its been this kind of night for Clemson PJ Hall exhausted but not before a little ball movement Baseline drive baseline drift and let me get a one more pass to PJ Hall whos shooting the lights out Clemson moving the ball well and running away with this one You can feel impressive getting his first start of the season He is part of tonights turning point brought to you by Coyote Tractor Well it hasnt turned this game but weve made a little bit of a detour by seeing what he can do Baba Miller his ability to space the floor attack a little bit off the bounce and at 7 feet tall the native of Spain has shown his ability on the offensive end of the floor Hes a guy thats just going to continue to get better and better and better So much potential for this young man And remember he got the start tonight because Matthew Cleveland unable to go Cleveland has that started 26 games every game this season for Florida State coming into the evening Back spasms keeping him on the bench He leads them in scoring and rebounding In fact he averages almost eight rebounds per game Terrence at sixth in the ACC and 14 points per game to lead the Nles Well hes a guy that he doesnt shoot the ball great but he does everything else great I mean long arms big hands rebounds really well is an excellent defender and hes popping up on draft boards with his potential if he can shoot the basketball from three A lot to like long wingspan just needs to translate to winning and I think next season this Florida State team is going to get back on the right track Applause As for this Clemson team trying to return to the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2021 when they lost in the first round to Ruckers 6056 My goodness How about the shooting stroke from Wiggins He just camps out in a corner and its so smooth Always ready to shoot the ball in shooting position Theyve done an excellent job of finding him today Eight points on two of three from deep Thats an excellent chip by Wiggins too Wiggins had made 11 threes total coming into this game And tonight for Wiggins two of three from beyond 22 ft 1 and 34 in away Coach Brownell has to be pleased with the effort tonight 13th year for Coach Brownell And a jam inside Middle Brooks First points of the night One thing you know about Middbrooks hell play physical He stays trying to seal around the rim That time rewarded for coach Brownell so good at home Hes 158 and 52 as the head coach of the Tigers in this facility and appears to be on his way to another victory Would be the 440th of his career What a job hes done as the steward of this program here in Tiger Town What a move inside Its Beetle How about Beetle showing his explosiveness It his game has been about slowing down a little bit and then using that athleticism to get to the cup taking the 74 Mloud to the cup Just so quick off the ball Six points for the red shirt freshman Mills will cross it over off the back iron for House everything contested and theyre always driving into two and three bodies Clemson from a team defensive perspective today has been awesome Hunter tried to take it down Broadway Knocked away at the last second by Jackson Music Tigers still shooting 60 for the game Thats after shooting 45 of the road at North Carolina on Saturday in a 20point loss Third in a row for Clemson Looks like that stretch may be over for the Tigers Quickly back out Middle Brooks for Beetle Good offensive possession though You get it in the middle Extra defender comes Ben Middlebrooks recognizes it Does the right thing with the ball Oh wow All kinds of contact in the paint and a foul against the Tigers as Deontay Green tries to shake off the after effects of that collision Clemson way in front of the visiting goals Applause Music Time now for the fast break presented by your local Ford dealer Hard to believe but NC State the only school in the Big Four to be ranked of the AP top 25 You have to go back to December of 1982 to find the last time that happened Of course the Pack would go on to win the national championship later that season And the reason theyre much better this season is that man right there DJ Burns a walking refrigerator with ballerina feet We know their guards can score Its just a matter of now they have this inside presence But you look at North Carolina You look at Wake Forest Look at that quad one section there at the bottom A combined 0 and4 Thats a huge factor in the decisionmaking process if they make the NCAA tournament Going to have to show well towards the end of this season Yeah Wade can take a big step on Saturday in Coral Gables against number 15 Miami which won at North Carolina on Monday That games at 2 Eastern on your regional sports network And Carolina and NC State get

its a backto back ACC brawl Oh my goodness First Boston College battles it out with Florida State Then Wake Forest takes on Miami and the slam The action tips off Saturday on Valley Sports South presented by your local Ford dealer The sounds inside Little John Coliseum and its all smiles if youre a Tiger fan Theres been a lot to cheer about Raced out to the lead early in the first half and have not looked back defensively just everywhere too Every time Florida State thinks they see a lane I mean it swallowed up by two and three players Health positioning has been terrific for Clemson all game long Florida State struggling to find answers on a team full of guys that are either coming back from injury or sitting out todays game Matthew Cleveland the biggest one whos out with back spasms first game that he has missed this season for Leonard Hamilton in the Florida State Seminals Tigers made it to the second round of the ACC tournament a season ago in Brooklyn after a first round victory against NC State Lost to eventual champ Virginia Tech in overtime 7675 Music Middle Brooks knocked it back out to Emway How about that Alex Emmon way set out a few games with an injury Back in and aggressive How about that Call that a Memphis bounce Green for Florida State Hes his first points of the game for Clemson Not surprisingly from Hemingway it was a threepointer 113 career threes Alex Hemanway the junior from Newberg Indiana Music Shot clock is at six Wow what a find Beetle the lefty Applause What a pass Chase Hunter had nowhere else to go That was a pass and a prey and a shot and a finish Unbelievable Nine points Beetle 12 of 24 on threepointers in the game for the Clemson Tigers A couple of players get tangled up Order is restored almost immediately How about this pass Nowhere to go with it Im just going to find somebody last minute Josh Beetle is going to find a way And thats a bucket That Beatles four of six And that was his first three of the game So the officials are going to take a look at that last sequence Terrence a little extracurricular activity here Ben Middlebrooks you have to know hes going to come in and play physical and Chanty Wiggins isnt in the picture there but this was coolers prevailing John Chanty Wiggins grabs a hold of Ben Middlebrooks and hangs on to him so he cant go back after him Smart play Youre up 38 points and Green just a little bit frustrated And quite frankly Tom if Im Leonard Hamilton Im not all that upset Showing a little fight Youre down Youre trying to get get some kind of rhythm to end this game Youll take a look down in the paint Green post up a little hard and then took exception to Middlebrooks This was a frustration foul more than anything And I will say this Ben Middlebrooks aint small We could have had some afters there but Middle Brooks 610 242 lbs separated from Deontay Green Well we have a moment moment The remaining schedule for the Clemson Tigers presented by Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina So they got the orange NC State thats on your regional sports network Virginia highest ranked ACC team and then Notre Dame which has had its struggles under Mike Bray who will step down as the head coach end of the season And there may not be a more important game for Clemson on their schedule than that NC State game in Raleigh even though NC State took a hit today but will qualify as a quad one win Clemson gets that one that really boosts their tournament resume in a season where they need more of those opportunities So Lee Cassell we have a dead ball contact foul contact two shot So we shoot one shoot two shots and get the ball Okay Okay So Lee Cassell just came over to Terrence for the update So after the foul we have a con or excuse me after the play was over foul right here on Deontay Green that will result in a technical foul Therell be two free throws and the ball for Clemson coming up Music And Im going to be honest like Im okay with it If Im Leonard Hamilton Im okay with it Yeah Excuse me It might have been an F1 Yeah So so initial foul on Ben Middlebrooks Hes going to shoot the one and one and then youre going to have the F1 on green post play Itll be two free throws and the ball to Clemson Okay so the key terminology flagrant one involves excessive contact as opposed to extreme contact with the F2 And so thats whats going on now but also after the play right So Wiggins at the line for the Tigers By the way Wiggins prior to the start of this game one for one from the free throw line Hes got a lot of talent Tom Got a lot of talent 69 Shoots it well Ben Middlebrooks though you know what hes bringing to the table Hes going to get under some guys skin I mean every time he moves Im sure it hurts It hurts to play for the defender or the opposition Thats right Music Crossing the sixminute mark of the second half Tom W Terrence Oglesby former Tiger standout Nice roll for Dylan Hunter and our talented ACC basketball production crew which works so hard They get here early they leave late and they bring you the picture and sound and document ACC basketball all season long We salute them Mills in traffic Caleb Mills wanting a foul call but Ben Middlebrooks coming over keeping his verticality Just a better finish by Caleb Mills Green trying to shake Beetle Skate move Never hit the intended target Wow it is snowballled for Florida State right now Clemson shooting the ball at an astronomical rate and Florida State just cant find ways to get easy looks at it You know the Tigers have maintained 60 in and around that neighborhood for the vast majority of this game Middlebrooks offensive glass preserving the possession I think everybody in the building wanted Beetle to hoist that one He chose wisely Music Theyll work that shot clock down You lost it on the way up but a foul was called Left arm Deontay Green but thats a killer You have to guard for 30 seconds and then an offensive rebound occurs You have to guard for another 20 seconds So you have to finish out possessions especially at the end of the game Its just a heartbreaker whenever youre playing defense or at least in my case attempting to play defense Tom selective defense Selective defense Josh Beetle the red shirt freshman from Columbia South Carolina is at the line Theres the standout freshman for Florida State coming back in Baba Miller as Green comes out How about Millers been the bright spot I mean if there if youre going to be able to find one down 40 I mean he hes been hes been a bright spot for this Florida State team only player in double digits in the box score Isaac Spain has come in replacing Mills who goes to the bench Spain hour wears 40 Applause Beetle is now up to 10 points Thats four Tigers in double digits in this game Paul Hunter Hunter Tyson and Beetle Spain coming in getting his deflection Florida States off and running Music Well Tom I think its fair to say that this has snowballed on the Sims Applause 21point halftime lead for the Clemson Tigers who have not lost a halftime lead all season Bele did well not to lose that one but deflected to Jackson 110 at the halftime lead Theyre

Music threepointer for house His 10th made three of the season Freshman from Dayton Ohio Played at Centerville High School in Ohio beside a young man named Gabe Cuffs whos going to go play at Indiana

basketball Thats exactly right Thats high school any level any place anywhere Tonight its all Tigers inside Little John Coliseum By the way they win 74 of the games played on this floor Offensive foul Ben Middlebrooks relentless on the defensive end Clemson on its way to victory Baba Miller double digit scoring for Florida State Music The 20 little Tigers on their way to victory here with 244 to go in the second half Protecting the paint is brought to you by CPI Security And one of the keys to the game was Florida State getting paint touches Clemson has limited those I mean both with swarming defense and taking charges in the lane I mean just swarming defense active hands forcing turnovers and taking charges Chase Hunter taking one to the chin there And then Ben Middlebrooks you want to talk about somebody whos as physical as they come cant do that And Clemson defensively today has been absolutely terrific Points in the paint favoring the Tigers 346 Could be on their way to one of their largest ACC wins in school history Remember theyre a charter member of the ACC Banks open at 847 Applause pm Music ACC formed back in 1953 and the Tigers were there How about Sholabi Okay this

Terrence Yeah I mean this is a huge win Clemson playing really well I was on that 2008 team against Boston College in the ACC tournament They had a really good team We just had everything falling that particular night So Devin Foster Matt Kelly Daniel Nasif all into the lineup Theyve seen limited action this season This is Foster for three Little too much adrenaline on that one and the shot clock will run out Thats what happens when you have to sit 39 12 minutes But Devin Foster in your screen I mean this was a guy he was Mr basketball in the state of Massachusetts in 2019 Came to Clemson decided to be a manager for a season and after the season being a manager was promoted to a walkon Its a guy despite that airball that you just saw I mean hes a nice college player Could have played at the division low division one or division 2 level Elected that he wanted to be part of an ACC program Yeah Promoted managers include Matt Kelly Devin Foster Jack Nusif his brother Daniel Nus who is in there right now I dont know if these guys expected to see some action in an ACC game against Florida State Remember the first time they played in Tallahassee was a onepoint lead and a win a onepoint lead Matt Kelly welcome to the ball game and pull Hes two for two on the season and Spain hour hits one at the other end We have a little mini battle going on here in the last minute of the game This one was decided early with a 21point halftime lead for the Clemson Tigers who have not given up a halftime lead all season Now 120 Foster weaving his way Looks like hes going to go to the free throw line for the first time this season is a senior from Canton Massachusetts The alltime leading scoreer at Canton Massachusetts Matt Kelly little jab step and a pull Hes going to be talking

threegame losing streak
