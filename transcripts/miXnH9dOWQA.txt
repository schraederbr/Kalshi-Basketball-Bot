momentum into Super Tuesday here at home Syracuse in the road orange NC State in the home white are officials tonight Roger SS Keith Kimble and Courtney green as we are underway in the ACC on super Tuesday and its Syracuse it starts with the ball mohamd di gets his second start in a row bring some size and some rebounding to the inside they have an advantage with some size on that front row take a look at the wolf pack starting five you mentioned diara and then DJ horn who was the hero on Saturday a big road win at Clemson how do they follow it up with another win tonight well I think they got to move the ball they got to get inside and use their size Advantage try to get DJ Burns established early theyre going to play him straight up the first possession shot clock down to three oconnell has to heave it and thats a shot clock violation Syracuse dialed in defensively to start the night NC States got to move the ball the ball stayed on the same side of the floor you got to reverse it against Syracuses defense the orange starting five a week ago had their best performance of the Season beat North Carolina they stormed the court at the Dome that wind got them back on the bubble but a loss in Atlanta the Georgia Tech on Saturday that does not help the orange resume a chance to get back on track tonight well their guard play has been outstanding as you mentioned Starling and Mintz and then of course Chris Bell is their best threepoint shooter hes made the most threes this season bell has it here hands off for Mintz shot clock at seven and heres JJ Starling pull up pop cant connect from Applause Deep this is a match up Im looking forward to right here is Justin Taylor trying to guard diara morcel scooped to the hoop to open the scoring Casey morcel morcel has got to have a big offensive game he hasnt had one in a while hes been up and down shooting the basketball hes much better when he attacks the rim first than he is settling for jump shots now both of these teams have been searching for consistency throughout ACC play Bell lines up a three and knocks it down mince handles the double team gets it to the short roll the great skip over the top a wide open three you cant leave Bell and give him that much time hes too good DJ Burns through traffic comes up Applause empty B triggers another triple and connects again backto back threes for Chris Bell thats Syracuses game playing in transition and look how quick Bell gets that release off Morel down the lane everything but the Finish back to Bell hes got the hot hand finds Malik Brown who misses the layup Sy really pushing their transition both of these teams playing with pace you know conell turned the ball over three times when they met the first time and he typically doesnt turn the ball over hes got the best assist turnover R in the ACC and slobs it for brown kicks out to Bell he has three made threes in the first three minutes and change time out Kevin Keats Chris Bell red hot in Raleigh to start this all ACC match up on super Tuesday were just getting Applause started this looks like an actual Farm look cute on the this Bell show to get us started here in Raleigh three threes in a little more than 3 minutes well the first three was off their execution the next two threes are their transition game he Sprints to the Deep corner and then he gets off the bounce great footwork over there in the corner where you got to have excellent footwork to be able to knock down that deep Corner through Bell has all nine for the orange to start and NC State in a sevenpoint hole early at home NC State loves to run this set right here for horn and he delivers nothing but the bottom of the net for DJ horn they go Iverson cut then they go into a ball screen and he is so good if you switch that he reads it so well and he doesnt need a lot of time and space heres Judah minz lines up a three missed it but thats the way you guard mince until he starts hitting them you go underneath all that ball screening action he is more dangerous off the bounce in the paint than he is from Three Horn hits it again DJ horn starting to heat up backto back threes for horn hes just stayed hot Applause this is a game loaded with talented guard play Malik Brown through the lane gets it to go is that three steps two and a half but it counts for two for the orange NC States played very well responding out of the Kevin Keats early timeout theyve been playing through horn who has it here Syracuse switching now just Taylor gets back burds backing down Brown into the double team missed it Jud has got to Applause move catch and shoot got it again Chris Bell a perfect four for four from three is he going to shoot till his arm falls off I would if I were him I was waiting for it well its kind of early in the game but Im thinking hes earned it I dont know if Ive had this early in the game somebody make those kind of shots that quickly four consecutive buckets for Chris bell all from three heres burds poked away Music Im good with it raining threes in Raleigh Chris Bell for Syracuse and DJ horns gotten loose for a couple outside the ark but Chris bell four for four outside the art to start this game Syracuse and Kevin Keats NC State head coach told us Debbie it was the worst Road performance of the season a team thats really good on the road the wolf pack four and three away from home just started slow tried to get back into it in the second half but not enough to recover they can never get in Rhythm they turn the ball over 14 times and Syracuse shot 32 free throws the wolf peek went N9 for 11 in that game Mintz and Starling combined for 46 and that 14 for 18 from the free throw throw line thats the most Judah mins shot all season and he leads the ACC in that category shot clock down down to five out of the timeout diara comes up short on the three he had made his last five threes hed taken he was five for 22 before the last two games then he went five for five outside the ark that tells me hes been in the gym working Bell looking for a fifth three in a row and he got it Chris Bell hes one of the most improved players in the ACC from just under seven points a game there is red hot and then there is Chris Bal five for five from three hes got 15 of the orang is 17 up ahead Brown running the floor Starling pull up pop hits it well Syracuse is getting whatever they want NC States got to do a much better job of tightening up on defense a 10 nothing orange run this is very similar to that game we were just talking about in the dome where Syracuse started red hot NC State dug a hole they couldnt get out of now hes got the switch he wants as he needs to keep that switch delivers DJ horn if he dribbles into something else Syracuse is going to switch back thats a smart play by DJ horn keep the matchup that you want hes got three triples so Chris Bell 15 for Syracuse and DJ horn with nine of NC States 11 everything for Chris Bells been catch and shoot and that time NC Stakes trying to close the space and make him put it on the floor well Kevin Keats you just mentioned it with the guards mid Starling combining for 46 last time probably said to his team let somebody else beat you and right now Chris Bell has delivered for the orange well they got to make somebody else score right keep judeans off the free throw line you got to stick to the process its to too early in the Applause game foul underneath on middle Brooks there is Kevin Keats I thought he was as detailed about angles and space on the floor today in shoot around as Ive seen him and thats what happens when you get to February the mental toughness and the ability to tweak and change is really especially the second time you go against somebody in this league and he made a great point to us he felt his team played with a desperation on Saturday at Clemson a critical Road win to keep the wolf pack on the bubble he said I need to see that same desperation tonight at home he called it art accountability Relentless and toughness thats what he wants his team to bring you thought they did that at Clemson when they were down 12 and they came back to hit the gamewinner and win Morel open three cant connect and it bounces in off Brown I think uh middle Brooks is going to get credit for that bucket even though I do believe Brown knocked it in counts as two points all the same heres guer Music Copeland no look past midd Brooks did well to break it up horn dangerous in transition right down the lane count it plus the foul DJ horn he has been so good for NC State this is a smart play by Middlebrooks two dribbles is all he gets dropping off for horn NC State doesnt want middle Brooks handling in transition give it to the guy thats got the Jets the last five games horn one of the hottest Shooters not just at the ACC but the entire country and he already has 12 tonight as that free throw rolls in and he doesnt turn the ball over hes had three turnovers in the last five games hes had 11 times this year where he has done not turned the ball over at all thats the other part of his decision making that makes him a complete player on the offensive end Copeland hammering it home ser he in a great Rhythm offensively when DJ horn jumps to keep the ball on the same side of the floor he opened up a straight line drive thats a smart play by Syracuse horn calls his own number again and Copeland gets the loose ball he has made such an impact this season for Syracuse Adrien arre has only been playing about seven players but hes had to go a little deeper into the bench get team ripped away by Taylor he and hes fouled another threepoint opportunity for NC State watch this play right here straight line drop it off finish at The Rim by Copeland Saturday to help decide who will win the ACC regular season you take a look at the best backcourts in the conference judin JJ Starling right up there amongst the best well and Salis and Miller for Wake got their hands full tonight with the back court of pit pit has won seven of their last eight and five in a row theyve got the best threepoint defense against a really good threepoint shooting team in wait interestingly tonight Vinson Starling only combining for two points soar it has been the Chris Bell show a perfect five for five from three red As team playing well on the road to start this one jumping out and showing on all that ball screen action middle Brooks going against hea righthanded hook left short Starling takes it himself in transition and Cashes in I mean you got to stop the ball thats Sterlings game right there to the midrange in transition what a beautiful pullup jump shot mince ties up Applause horn foul call thats his second this year Syracuse team lacks depth as mince heads to the bench you see Kyle cuff The Freshman come in I think you take him to the bench you got the lead see if you can keep some burn some possessions with him off the floor DJ horn continues to lead the way he has 14 of the wolf packs Music Applause 21 double team on Starling they trying to keep the ball loaded up to the strong side Copeland in attack mode he gets to the rim and finishes thats exactly what Copeland is supposed to do when the ball reverses you look to attack right away before the close out its the best time to attack and heres Music Burns good passer out of the post I mean so any anyone else shoot but horn right now he doesnt think so and he hits it again DJ horn cuts the lead in half degree of difficulty wow he can shoot till his arm falls off we might need some double ice buckets in the back theyve ruled it a two on the screen I thought that was a clear three as cuse answers the other way obviously thatll be reviewed at the next timeout horn lost the handle this time up ahead Copeland and he lays it up and in well ever since Copeland hit that game winner at Miami I think hes been a much more confident guy his body language his production all of it Syracuse has made their last nine shots heres Copeland again the steal and the slam quader Copeland liftoff in Applause Raleigh just miscommunication by NC State horn trying to answer draws the Applause foul you watch this right here horn no one else should be shooting was he behind the line I think theyre going to review it looks behind to me look at the reaction by the Music bench Roger AR is going to take a look at it right now theyre looking at a possible upgrade not the shot they got to take a look at the shot too well tell you what the officials decide when we come back Syracuse at NC State here on super Tuesday ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is presented by Progressive Insurance bundle home in Auto and save and visit Progressive doc the back here on super Tuesday presented by Progressive the ACC Debbie anelli Jay alter with you a whole lot that the officials had to look at DJ hord was fouled underneath the hoop by MOA and then in the aftermath you see horn Step Up quader Copeland some clapping horn goes into him so the officials took a look at it Keith Kimble just came over to give you the call what did he have to say they have a an elbow by DJ horn and thats what they upgraded that that on so they have added a I didnt see an elbow unless our cameras missed it what we just showed you I didnt see an elbow from DJ horn thats what he said on DJ horn well DJ Horns headed to the line cuz again he was fouled by MOA before whatever happened after the foul right so then then we shoot the free throws here for the for the foul on hea there theres the elbow so it was before horn even got the ball is what theyre calling the flagrant for so now Syracuse will shoot and then Syracuse will get the Applause ball and they send Chris Bell to the line who has been red hot tonight the Syracuse is going to get the ball at the point of interruption which is going to be I believe down in the Baseline underneath NC States Applause basket I just asked Roger SS too because lost in the flagrant was they still had to review if that DJ horn shot was a three or two he just told me theyll review it at the under four they were a little busy at the under eight Im surprised they didnt just take care of it while they were over there and adjudicate that at the same time wide openen three Chris Bell he has made six threes in this first half he is not cooled off he 18 points for Bell Syracuse has built a 12point lead horn trying to do it himself comes up empty there foul on the floor itll stay Wolfpack basketball in the corner the Deep corner and DJ Burns is not going to be able to get Music there and thats Copeland second foul its good space Music great find by Burns pull up pop too much on Applause it Second Chance points rolls off the rim couple of good looks for Applause cuff Music pass in attack mode draws the foul and gets it to go well Brion pass has earned his minutes in practice hes gotten a few extra minutes in games its a really good take right here off the bounce his job is to play some D and distribute the ball but if you get an option down the lane line you got to take it completes the threepoint play cuts the lead to Applause nine Starling a really good look from three and he drills it hes got a funky looking hitch in his shot but if you give him that much time and his threepoint shooting has really improved Pro Jerry mcnare the great shooter in Syracuse history spent a lot of time with him on his mechanics so that is paid off diara trying to answer with a three cant finish birs draws the foul and the thing about Syracuse right now Jay they got the right people taking shots right this is a great pass right here to a wideopen starling he knocks it down you see that little hitch on the top of his shot we were told today that came from Notre Dame with a little bit of a shoulder issue that created some of that hitch and theres Jerry MCM what a great shooter I was going to say if you want somebody looking at your shot is there anybody better than Jerry Mack not many we had a great conversation with Jerry Mack today had his son with him and he was working him out today was fun watching super Tuesday presented by Progressive continues tonight over on ESPN in the Big 12 Baylor and BYU tips off at 9 you do not not want to miss it Mark Pope has done a fantastic job at BYU that rolls in for copelan Syracuse cant stop scoring they are shooting 79 from the floor and have made their last 12 shots Burns answers NC State scoring themselves they just cant get a stop on the defensive end thats been all offense and you know Im okay with that this is his best Syracuse has looked off season maybe barring the game a week ago against Music Carolina Down Low brown swatted by birds up ahead morcel JY morcel draws the foul and hell get two at the line the transition game started by the DJ Burns block Burns getting cleaned up by the trainer well that block by Burns marks the first Syracuse Miss in their last 13 attempts made 12 in a row before DJ Burns got in front of that one comes back into the game Applause here if you saw DJ Burns walking around campus you would think hes the left tackle on the football team yeah you you might but then You see his footwork in his hands and you might think hes the tight Applause end and at times he passes out of the post like a quarterback I think hes an excellent passer I think his IQ is out Applause standing he did a really good job right there coring the penetration without fouling Starling left it short offensive rebound bounces to Copeland to miscommunication with B tried to throw a no look pass to the Applause corner Music Burns backing down brown right through the double team for two eventually over time if you continue to play him in single coverage he is going to make you Applause pay hland showing off the handle and hes fouled DJ Burns is so good at using the bounce to get himself in the right spot look at the contest by brown but hes just too strong too big too determined but tomorrow night a terrific double header on ESPN Kyle filipowski and Duke taking on Miami at seven and then in the SEC its Kentucky and LSU that is tomorrow on ESPN surprise Kentucky is at 17 after that Auburn win I thought they might move up a little bit more its pretty big W well you couldnt ask for a bigger statement on the road with college game day in town than that one B step back three lefted short Burns in perfect position cant finish it morcel battling for it and its Syracuse ball just good hustle on the glass by both teams Syracuse under sized on that front line yet has some length and some athleticism to counter I think Malik Brown has done a really good job playing inside I thought he was going to be more of a 34 now hes playing more of a 45 how about this stat Debbie Syracuse has 45 points shooting better than 70 from the floor but Judah midz has scored none of them Chris Bal for his sth b three of the night drills it goodness come on amazing 21 points all Beyond The Arc one shy of his career high you have to close his space every time the ball goes to the middle on the short roll Syracuse has skipped to the other side and the recipient has been Bell seven triples yeah what a week for my partner Debbie anelli everybody at he SPN is so proud the nouth Basketball Hall of Fame awarding you the Kurt gouty award for 2024 they honored you here in your home of Raleigh NC State grad and that was a magical special moment very nice thank you and thank you to Zubin and D for your kind words thank you to everyone was very nice and NC State I was surprised that was a a very nice surprise I feel bad should we get some water for the flowers are they going to make it till post game yeah and as D said not a lot of Defense are this one Syracuse shooting better than 70 from the floor Chris Bell is locked in he is 7even for seven for three Oakland through traffic finds Bell again why not Chris Bell I mean is not human eight made threes in this first half pass and Brion pass you cant help off him now you got to stay locked on him come on Chris Bell incredible pass trying to answer cant connect Syracuse with 51 points at this first half and their leading scorer on the season Judah minz has none of them yeah impressive pass on Bell again bell with a huge size Advantage NC State bumps off and switches now more cells got him Starling in attack mode missed it and thats the way you guard Bell if casy Morel had leaned a little bit to try to help on that penetration in the Gap it would have been a kick to Bell for probably his ninth triple which would be a career high hes tied it right now with eight made threes in a game horn leaves it short he gave it right back to him to pull up his first Miss of the night after he made eight threes NC State pushing the pace and get through in Applause transition you know everything has been catch and shoed I think one triple he put the ball on the floor that time he had to put the ball on the floor thats what you have to do if youre NC State yeah let him catch and shoot copelan attacks leaves it for brown who will get two at the line shot clock was down to one I mean was there any doubt in transition the skip to the corner Judah loving it he spent most of the first half on the bench with two fouls has not affected this Syracuse offense you cannot help off Chris Applause Bell i just keep running sets for him you know I would just let him keep shooting I mean what is he nine for 10 eight of nine eight of n eight of nine incredible still with a half to play heres horn hes been the bright spot for NC State 21 points when they need a bucket they run that set that Iverson cut over the top and he is so good on that misdirection drive hes good at everything and hes accounted for more than half of the wolf packs points in this first half two for one opportunity here Syracuse is going to get the ball back shot clock down to two Starling has to hurry gets rid of it in time and Cates in time out red ay the most points scored in a half this season for Syracuse theyve been on fire here on the road in Raleigh on super Tuesday Syracuse up 15 Music Fairlife Ultra filtered milk makes every moment better with 50 more protein and 50 less sugar plus a creamy taste that makes that smoothie even smoo fair Music life help your family warm up to mornings with the protein to help fuel your day wake up to the goodness of Jimmy Dean maybe its something about super Tuesday for the orange and ACC play a week ago they were storming the court in Syracuse after upsetting North Carolina now a week later on the road at NC State theyve opened up a 15point lead well if youre Kevin Keats you got to remind your guys that you got to play the percentages right Chris Bell has been fantastic hes a 39 threepoint shooter you got to play the numbers you got to tell your guys you got to stick to the process and you got to Chip Away remember they were down 12 at the end of Clemson and came back Kevin ke probably cant wait to get his team to the locker room and Coach arrey probably doesnt want to go back there now you seted the wolf back down but certainly not out a lot of time left in this game Zone by Syracuse good change off the timeout you got to get the ball below the free throw line Bon pass has to hurry shot clock down to three deep Three Horn missed it time for Syracuse to add to this 15point lead before halftime Starling pull up three cant Applause connect and Syracuse finishes shooting 67 from the floor of the headlines and Brien pass getting the start for NC State so Kevin Keats obviously liked his energy and his effort off the ball fou call on Malik Brown on the floor theres a quiet first half for DJ Burns usually hes been a catalyst offensively you 10 points but quiet but heres the thing Jay he doesnt have any personal fouls so he can be aggressive in the next 20 he can be aggressive off the bounce he can be aggressive defensively Mo diara on a rim rocker to start this second half plus the foul you know thats the kind of emotional lift sometimes a dunk can be worth more than two points and NC State needs something this is a great pass by DJ Burns and a really good finish at The Rim well if he makes the free throw itll be worth three well thats right exactly he does so it is worth more two no I agree NC State they they didnt have as many energy plays to get this building into it Syracuse had the majority of them in that first half back to to Mintz and hell try and pick up his first points of the night from the foul line and think about that for Syracuse you put up 55 points in the first half and your leading scorer doesnt score yeah its impressive its good ball movement its going to the hot hand right its a mature level that you want your team playing at in February when somebodys hot feed them its an unselfish characteristic about this Syracuse first half as well Mintz went to the line 18 times at the first meeting against the Wolfpack this is his first trip there tonight and Syracuse is 9 and2 on the season when Mintz attempts 10 or more free throws in a game there was really good execution by Syracuse they clear out the side so that mince could go back door on the smaller Defender Brien pass see now thats where pass has got to reverse the ball to diara and then let J uh DJ burn shape up to the ball Syracuse wants you to keep the ball on the same side of the floor they load up their defense that way trying to get it inside to burn good defense by Taylor heres pass 5 Seconds to shoot Bon pass on the Move poked Away by Taylor up ahead Bell rejected at The Rim but Taylor there to clean up the Applause spill Burns trying to spin his way free attacks missed it and another offensive put back so each team Trad offensive rebounds that cast in for two NC State picking up full court here in the second half theyre going to have to use some energy right here trying to get a stop trying to get some rhythm going on the offensive end sometimes Jay you can stimulate your offense by really grinding it out defensively the Rhythm they lacked stops in the first half Syracuse shot better than 65 from the floor Taylor called for a travel and when youre down by 14 you got to string together some stops get the crowd back in it we had a great conversation with Coach Audrey today about how he has managed the team and become a better play caller as the season has going on and just how much more comfortable he seems to be managing his team take some time when youre a firste head coach well youre right we really enjoyed our our chat with Coach Entre and he said look you get that big momentum win against North Carolina everybody wants to follow it up with a win in Atlanta against Georgia Tech but you cant let that be too big of a let down an opportunity to get things back on track tonight and his team is certainly performed on Thursday you dont want to miss it womens college basketball out west Utah and UCLA a top 20 matchup Thursday 930 Easter time for Paulie Pavilion I had the first match up between those two teams at Utah and it went to overtime so dont be surprised if thats a possession for possession fight both teams very good offensively Pack 12 really really good this season on the womens side Min goes right into Burns no call thats the kind of aggression Im talking about DJ Burns at The Rim goes vertical creates a turn Applause over oh he might have got away with one I think its di that was Applause vertical stays Syracuse ball after they originally awarded it to the wolf pack Applause heres Starling 5 Seconds to shoot JJ Starling stripped off his knee and that time NC State does force to turn over well thats good combination uh Taylor digging just a little bit and Horn knocking it free to get another deflection you know NC State had 35 deflections in the in the Clemson game diara miscommunication with Burns gives it right back thats the seventh turnover tonight for NC Applause State good tag by horn Min passes off to br giv go right back to him flying to the rim and he scores his first basket of the night yeah Taylor expecting some help from Burns but Burns just laterally could not get there and with that made bucket a th000 career points in juds Syracuse career seventh fastest Syracuse player to get to a th000 did it in just 59 games Burns trying to save it gives it right to mince up ahead Brown rejected at The Rim by Marcel NC state has numbers diara the Applause Finish Jaden Taylors got the Judah minz assignment right now hes picking them up full court theres a clear out men draws the contact it rattles home and one so good you reach in and he swipes it through and going to get another and one opportunity big block by Casey morcel in the transition game of NC State off their defense pack trying to get some rhythm going theres great message from Kevin Keats and you look at the ACC nine black head coaches proudly leading their respective programs and three including Adrian ay in their first season its a great leadership move by the ACC to have so many quality men on the top of all these great programs leading these other young men into the future and I know Kevin Keats personally is is hes a great dude he cares about his guys he cares out his program and hes a winner hes been a winner his team trying to claw back they have trailed throughout DJ horn leads the way with 24 points hes been the biggest bright spot tonight Brown miscommunication with Taylor and now the turnovers are starting to pile up for Syracuse who played nearly perfect basketball in that first half I mean I would just keep the ball in DJ Horns hands and and allow him to work theres that set they like so much where hes so good at playing out of this brown stretches that hedge all the way to the half court line and they still can get back and recover heres horn shakes free Off the Mark that time middle Brooks in perfect position to clean up the spill I think NC State picking up full court is giving them some some energy Brown another turnover heres Jaden Applause Taylor great ball movement looking for the Finish the midd Brooks will head to the line to shoot two off the turnover NC State runs the floor hard thats what you need to do if youre Kevin kes team youve got to speed up the game and theyve done that theyve done it with their defense everyone got a touch on this play and middle Brooks will go to the free throw Music line Kevin keeps his team iss now cut it to Applause nine Chris Bell quiet in this second half after making eight threes in the first half Bell has not even attempted a shot in nearly 6 minutes here in the second got it to single digits and for the first time tonight if feels like the crowd is behind the wolf pack here in Raleigh on a 7 nothing run Bell trying to quiet them missfires horn in attack mode throws it Applause away and Adrian Andre takes a time out Kevin Keats upset because NC State with all the momentum a seven nothing run to get back into it but a turnover halting so momentum and as the award goes its its a team award theres so many people that I get to share it with its not about one person its about the team especially our team at ESPN so grateful for teammates like you Jay thank you thank you to everyone for uh all the the kind words you shared a great quote with me the day you got the award that your former head coach K Yao told you that it you know its not about the recognition its the journey she uh would always say its not about the awards its about the rewards and thats what Ive spent my time thinking about and Ive been thinking a lot about her lately as well so very nice thank you for bringing that up and we just put together during that break that this is a very even broadcast because one wolf pack Alum and one orange alum so its always fair and balanced through from my seat and I know your seat is the same way and NC state has done a nice job battling back in this game Syracuse would balloon the lead to 15 well I think that Syracuse needs to run something for Chris Bell and see if they can get him going again they tried to get him coming off a pin down on the top of the floor and NC State did a really good job of closing the space on him when you make eight threes in the first half half you got to at least give it a try in the second I was about to say you get probably hes missed one in the second half you probably get three or four to see if youve cooled off right when you hit absolutely one shy of a School record in one half well hes got to hunt some shots too and NC state has changed and put multiple Defenders on him now theyre going with diara mince in attack mode I mean he had a running start at oconnell he is so good off the bounce he can get to his spots he controls the ground he doesnt turn it over very much talking about mince now where bell has quieted mince has taken over and minz was scoreless in the first half when Bell had 26 and mince all his points have come in this second half well you we talked about the percentages right I mean one of the things we said was you got to expect that Bell might cool off a little bit and mince is going to pick it up hes up to nine now all in the second half Adrien arrey doesnt care who scores and when as long as Syracuse could get what would be a critical Road win an orange team that played their way back on to the NCAA tournament bubble with that win against North Carolina last Tuesday this would be a quad one road win as it stands tonight oconnell recovers passes out of the double team Taylor contested three no good offensive rebound middle Brooks and he draws the foul hes been very aggressive on the offensive glass I think thats why hes getting extended minutes he has worked on the boards this is a tremendous move inside its a great rebound but its a really good piece of footwork inside to be able to get to his offand and draw a foul and where NC state has the clear advantage in this game is the front Court they have more depth more height felt like they have not used it enough in this game so far tonight as we remind you ACC Network womens basketball a triple header on Sunday tips off noon eastern time Notre Dame at Boston College and Carolina at Virginia Tech the hokeys in the top 10 and NC State number six in the country at Duke thats all on Sunday well Virginia Tech on the womens side is 1 nine in a row but before we even get to Sunday on Thursday Ive got North Carolina hosting NC State over in ch that be a great game that should be good its always good its a steal from Jay billis that game usually delivers too A lot of them have in the ACC close competitive throughout and somehow the league gets penalized because its been competitive Taylor great pass midle Brooks denied the finish what a pass NC State trying to get back in this one theyve cut it to single digits on super Tuesday Syracuse up by nine looking for a smarter way to mop try the Swiffer power M win for Virginia Tech there how about Miami they were picked in the top after the Le and if they get healthy thats not a team you want to see in the ACC tournament Georgia Tech has beaten more Carolina D Clemson and the Syracuse team the crowd roaring the wolf pack on theyve cut this Syracuse lead in half what was once a 15point lead for the oranges down to seven critical both for the NCAA tournament resume and the conference standings are we just showed you Ms turn around no good copelan one hands it in qu dear Copeland has been excellent Music tonight diara misfires from Applause three he got the ultimate bail out in a late shot clock and Jude a men because he is so good at creating his own stolen away diara couldnt control it though got a hand to it itll stay Syracuse ball you know ENC stays up the line and over playing youve got to shorten that angle to make that entry or ball fake it and go back door this is where where he is dangerous right here goes right into Burns Blows By him lost the handle though and travels I mean he bounces off DJ Applause Burns heres horen has 26 points to lead the wolf pack into burs spins into a double team passes out of it Taylor lines up to three and buries it just like that its a twopossession game he puts it on the money on a rope to the shooting pocket on the opposite side of the floor thats where his IQ comes in DJ Burns Starling trying to quiet the crowd and he does its so tough to keep the Syracuse guards out of the paint mince and Starling both so good off the bounce horn right to the rim rejected by Copeland hes made a couple of big plays tonight 16 points hes dialed in defensively too hes been so good Off the Bench for them Music Applause tonight and mince has gotten the better of oconnell into the second half off to Copeland has a step on diara somehow gets it to go how about that from quader Copeland hes up to 18 g go B commits the foul another great pass by DJ Burns horn turns the corner and copelan is waiting and then look at how he stretches and reaches talk about delivering on both ends quader Copeland Off the Bench for Syracuse you mentioned it ever since he hit that game winner to beat Miami hes been a different player confident Energy Great motor Off the Bench to know what his role Applause is J the Min out of this game Syracuse played their best basketball actually when he was on the bench in the first Applause Music half Copeland for three too much on it Applause 10 on the timer for horn goes to work and now Burns finds the back door Jaden Taylor flying for two another magnificent drop off pass by Burns Applause Starling blits the double team showing off the handles thought he was fouled didnt get the call lets see how much longer Adrien auu can go without Jud to Min on the floor as NC States making a little Applause run you can sense a momentum shift right here VC State can Applause score horn step back three got it DJ horn cuts the lead in half time out Syracuse ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is presented by Progressive Insurance bundle home in Auto and sa visit progressivecom Music scoring seven minutes still to play NC State back within three the wolf pack outscoring the orange in the second half 3119 thought it was a good timeout to get Judah mench back in the game hes going to have the ball in the late clock hes the ultimate bailout for them down the lane swiped Away by DJ Burns 2 seconds on the shot clock NC state has done a really good job of contesting and keeping him off the free throw line shot loock down to one Min trying to beat the buzzer and it drops for him the officials will review that he got it off in Applause time take another look yep thats good gets it off clearly plenty of time to spare and a friendly rooll for the visiting Judah minz who was scoreless in the first half but is certainly made up for it in the second he has 11 meanwhile Chris Bell who had 26 points on eight made threes has been the Invisible Man in the second half but mince is kind a picked up where bell left off will it be enough to finish this game with a critical Road win is the question I thought at the beginning of the game and I still feel this way that mince is the key if NY they can keep him in front force him to take tough shots hes going to have the ball in his hands as the game wears on now in the last 642 you have to keep him off the free throw line and contest and keep in mind the NC State guards and their defense has had a tough time containing mins but everybody in the league does but if he gets to the second level right now DJ burns doesnt have any fouls so he can stay aggressive try to go for a few blocks see if you can you know get some stops that way once he gets past that first level also playing through Burns right here he has been terrific at dropping dimes horn in attack mode count it plus the foul DJ horn tremendous turn in the corner 31 points tonight for horn you mean he goes right at Chris Bell at that hedge and Bell tries to recover you got to guard the ball not the action with the contact and one for DJ Music horn and he completes it the with 32 points and just like that NC State who was once down by 15 has it back within two Syracuse LED this whole game Applause J NC state scored the first basket to make it two nothing since then its been all Applause Syracuse stolen away porn the hot hand rejected by Mintz loose ball Falls to Starling up ahead Bell passes off the three DJ Burns getting out there to contest the three now run something for Bell oh they waited too late they got the switch back look Adrien ay is exasperated on that you got to read that they still go to Bell who cant keep it in play turnover you have DJ burns with Bell now you wait now they switch it back look at his exasperation Im with you coach first year head coach trying to settle his team down what was once a 15point lead is down to two Syracuse clinging what would be a critical conference roow to win but NC State the team with momentum Burns Tangled Up finishes to tie it at 76 up ahead Copelands fouled and it rolls in quader Copeland theyre going to call it Applause intentional burns with the spin collects and finishes and then on the other end official doesnt think he made a play on the ball not even going to review it Roger SS is coming over to tell us Roger SS comes over says were not even going to review it flagrant Music one and that will halt all the momentum Kevin keatss team had built to tide at 76 Kevin Keats is asking for a review but I think theyre going to provide him a professional courtesy and say were not going to go look at this this is like iceing Copeland at the free throw line right now as well now theyre going to change their mind and theyre going to go Music look Copeland too shy of a career high hes at 20 points tonight Kevin Keats is trying to claim that he made a play on the ball what do you think I think it was clearly intentional that he was trying to stop the progression and to not give up a layup now the letter of the the law is or the rule is is excessive too much unnecessary and avoidable thats what an F1 language Applause is to me hes not making a play on the ball no hes not hes trying to well hes trying to stop the layup he just doesnt make a play on the ball he reaches for his arm and you could consider him an I dont know if you want to consider him an Airborne shooter or not because if thats the case its always an Applause F1 see you could say hes Airborne there and if thats the case its an F1 and I think thats what thats what way Roger a saw it and thats the way the crew saw it thats why they came over to us and said they were not going to review it the Syracuse shooting a perfect 13 of 13 from the foul line Applause tonight now they get the ball at the point of interruption underneath their own hoop leading by three only one timeout left for the Syracuse Applause Music Applause team Kevin Keats has three timeouts sometimes NC State likes to pre switch on these out of bounds plays mids turn turn around copelan there puts it up and in its a career high for quader copelan 23 five minutes to go the orange leading by five a critical conference Road win for a bubble team burds takes it himself and Cashes in where he cat es it and brown has battled him all night but when the help comes he spins away and he gets over that right shoulder with that left half hook its Applause Music beautiful copelan the hot hand going right at Birds missed Applause it Applause Burns attacking Brown and hes fouled is he getting two free throws was he in the act of shooting official says yes last time down sees the help spins away High release over that right shoulder Music Music Applause coming up right after us flip over to ESPN Baylor BYU super Tuesday continues presented by Progressive we hope that one as as good as this one in Raleigh I expect it to be Mark Pope has done an outstanding job with his team 30 NCAA tournament appearances for BYU the most without a final four but hes got a a really good team this year DJ Burns checks out after he knocks down both foul shots and we have a onepoint game four minutes to play Super Tuesday in the ACC and its all setting up for a fun Applause finish Chris Bal who had 26 points in the first half scoreless through the second half gives it up Starling down the lane hangs left it short bounces out fresh 20 for Syracuse is standing right next to you give him the ball has it Applause here finds Copeland back out to Mint for a three cant connect and a foul called Copeland flying in aggressively tangled up with Ben Middlebrooks and you do not want to miss this finish onepoint game in the ACC matchups between them thats when you guys are done a buckle up weve got a fun finish here in Raleigh Syracuse 81 NC State 80 then midd Brooks ties it at 81 and now a chance to give NC State their first lead since it was two nothing Syracuse LED Debbie by 15 at halftime how have the wolfb comeback full court pressure a change in body language a lock down of Chris Bell and DJ horn has stayed hot hes got 32 points and NC state has shot 57 in the second half and 60 from three the wolf pack have claw back down 15 now leading by one three minutes to play Syracuse was RedHot from three in the first half they hit nine of 13 theyre 0 for two in the second mince takes it himself and fires the orange back in front this is his time he did not score in the first half mince has 13 second half points he is going to have the ball in his hands so is this man right here 32 points for horn tonight has it here switch working on copelan passes out of it falls to Taylor has to he it cant connect battle for the rebound Taylor Wins it back and finally middle Brooks flies in and is fouled that would be the sixth offensive rebound for Ben Middlebrooks he has been aggressive he has been in Pursuit on this end especially in the second Applause Music half and that is Malik Browns fourth foul when NC State lost up in Syracuse Syracuse shot 32 free throws that is the 26th free throw attempt for NY State who went nine for 11 up in the Applause dome rimmed in and out so it stays tied at 83 little more than 2 minutes left to play for two NCAA tournament bubble teams this is one you have to have this is a quad one opportunity for Syracuse on the Applause road Starling shot clock at three spins his way fre cant hit it and a foul called it stays Syracuse way Applause what Copeland has been relentless on this end of the floor as well watch him crash shoved by Taylor yeah he beats Taylor to the boards that is just the fifth team foul for NC State thats why theyre in boming mince is going to get it right back Applause here get it Attack Mode too much off the window Adrien autrey wanted a foul he is hot over on the Syracuse sideline horn weaving through traffic and a timeout taken by Kevins I love that timeout emotions running High get your group under control make sure you get the shot that you want not the shot that Syracuse wants you to take and arrey is still upset Music well a week ago on super Tuesday Syracuse went down to the wire and then really dominated the last few minutes to beat Carolina this was their best performance of the Season put them back in the NCAA tournament conversation then you really hurt your resume by following it up with a loss in Atlanta the Georgia Tech on Saturday if they can win tonight theyre still right on that bubble still in the conversation both of these teams Debbie have just struggled the string together results inconsistent has been the word for both of these teams because for NC State you go on the road and beat Clemson on Saturday you cant lose at home to Syracuse so the final 127 is going to likely determine who stays on the bubble out of these two teams its so tough it is hard to win its hard to win on the road you have to protect your home court in this league its too hard mince on horn DJ Burns in for offensive possessions he gets it here Malik Brown with four fouls guarding him passes Off Taylor tried to squeeze it to diara and copelan got a hand to Applause it Syracuse with one timeout one minute remaining in regulation tied at 83 Starling down the lane didnt get a good look it rims out for Copeland porn with 32 points floats it up it doesnt fall Hopeland rips it away for Syracuse 10 seconds separating the shot clock from the game clock youre going to run the clock down and then youre going to let mince go to work off the bounce Copeland a career high 23 and hes fouled will go to the line to shoot two how about Adrien ay trusting copelan in this situation Malik Brown has set really good screens all game for all the guards to be able to get Applause downhill copelan shooting 67 from the foul line this season hes three of four tonight rims in gives Syracuse the lead with 16 seconds in regulation and he improves his career high to 24 points tonight what a night it has been for quider Copeland and the weight of this game firmly planted on his shoulders got it I think you got to attack the rim I think Kevin ke is going to call timeout right here y had two to work with decides to take one now usually in this situation theyll try to get a direct pass to DJ Burns and try to play through him but you have to put pressure on the defense and look to attack try to get to the free throw line try to go off the bouns try to play downhill each team with one timeout remaining Syracuse has the possession arrow and keep in mind at the end of the half Adrien ay is the last possession switched to Zone its the only possession of Zone that we have seen in the game would you do it here I might consider it I think thats probably the conversation that hes having NC State trailed at Halftime by 15 they have roared back to be in this game now can they come up with the offensive execution to either tie it or take the lead a switch to Zone would definitely be a little bit disruptive CU it would force NC State to hesitate and it might force a jump shot and not a downhill drive but thats why coach arrey gets paid the big bucks and Im sitting over here on the other side for Kevin Keats though right Im playing through Burns and DJ horn if I can get a direct feed to the block Im throwing it to the block he hit the game he hit a game uh tying shot game winner at Notre Dame in late game situations usually its DJ Burns who gets the touch because again hes such a gifted passer out of the post think I dont think hes in the game right now and then it might just be all DJ horn he has 32 points tonight I mean he can go off the bounce without a screen I would say DJ horn on the top of the floor dont bring two to the ball oh Burns is in the game yes he doesnt sit during timeouts Syracuse has won six straight against NC State they are clinging to a twopoint lead to make it seven in a row Kevin Keats worked on this play today the screening angle so important right here to get the ball in bounds to DJ horn under 10 seconds remaining horn has it copelan all over and forces a shot up no good and a foul called on Casey morcel with 32 seconds remaining Syracuse will be shooting one and one horn leaning into Copeland no foul called Kevin Kat is let official hear it Music too well thats a tough no call Judah mids shooting one and one NC State does have a timeout makes the front end Min a perfect six for six from the line and this free throw would make it a two possession Applause game got got it NC state has a timeout Kevin Keats deciding not to use it into Burns who heaves it from half court missed it and Syracuse comes away with a huge Road win in Ry 8783 the final
