at Georgia Hes ready to get things going See Jake Wallen one of the newcomers on the court in the starting lineup And the one guy who cheering saw meaningful game action a year ago Dylan Hunter brings it across midcourt underway here in Little John Coliseum Tigers coming off that program record season 27 wins Inside effort comes off no good Bal El Shakiri who began his career over at Waford One of the newcomers from New Hampshire got cheering that rebound joined to the starting lineup by Richmond transfer Jack Graham and some others whove joined Posair A lot of new faces for head coach Nathan Davis in New Hampshire They want to play fast They really want to push tempo Thumpson one of the best defensive teams in the ACC going to try to slow him down Just eight wins a year ago for the Wildats Early attempt from outside Not going to go down applause John Robinson came to them from Hostra Tiger team as everyone knew except for Hunter who fires for the first time in 2526 from outside and drains it That was the biggest thing Dylan Hunter improved on this past season Made 24 threes shooting just over 30 Another big key for the Clemson offense this season Robinson again and that comes off no good Wallen who arrived from Utah with the rebound for Clemson Really big lineup for head coach Bradell I think Jake Wallen is kind of an Xfactor for the Tigers He can shoot the basketball and he can rebound it Godfrey leaves it short Robinson battles with Hunter Wallen and Godfrey Heres Porter Justin Porter arrive from Middle Tennessee And you saw RJ Godfrey take that early three He made a couple two years ago for the Tigers Did not make a three last year at the University of Georgia RJ Goffrey wants to continue to improve as a shooter from the perimeter New Hampshire two years ago won 16 games Again last year an 8 win season They were beset by injuries to key players throughout the year Could never get any rhythm Shot clock coming up on five El Shakiri far from the hoop Thats not where he likes to shoot but hell give it a try And its shot clock violation JD give us your keys to the game as they just went all the way through the shot clock Yeah absolutely For the Clemson Tigers this year its going to be to continue to stretch the four m 85 threes per game this past season Theyve got to do that again this year to create some space And then for New Hampshire co head coach Nathan Davis has always played with tremendous tempo and pace They want to be one of the 30 fastest teams in college basketball this season Godfrey off the feed from Porter RJ Godfrey happy to be back Average about six and a half last season for the Georgia Bulldogs Robinson arrived from Hofra so he could score like that The newcomers for the New Hampshire team will have bigger roles than they had in their previous program Thats what their head coach Nathan Davis told us earlier today Got a whistle away from the ball But particularly for a guy like Kon Robinson came from Hofster where he put up really good numbers 28 points against St Johns last year But RJ Godfrey the senior from Swany Georgia wasting no time Thats his second shot They went crosscreen action for him to start the game Able to get the ball down low and use that big athletic frame to score John Squire picking up the first foul for New Hampshire Off the inbound Godfrey inside Had it knocked away by Squire but he couldnt save it So itll go back to the Wildats Theyre based in Durham New Hampshire Yeah you see RJ Godfrey right here working down in the low post Theyve tried to go inside to him a couple of times already against the thinner John Squire Doing a good job right there holding his ground Squire a Pepperdine transfer also played at a community college out in San Francisco Al Shankerie had injury issues during his time at Wford was limited last season particularly Working the point out high John Robinson out of Apka Florida Shot clock under 10 lost the dribble Tried to give it away to somebody Al Shakiri again far from the basket with the shot clock winding down Got that away in time Didnt hit the rim And another shot clock violation for the Wildats Dylan Hunter fortunate right there Got a little overaggressive uh with El Shakiri Got out of position Allowed him to drive the basketball to the rim Just unable to finish Dylan Hunter running the point Tigers have a really good freshman Zack Foster who you see while we strong move to the bucket and one Thats a great example of Jake Wallens ability to not just shoot the basketball Weve seen him rebound it but coming off of that dribble handoff straight downhill Really impressive right there Pete Ive had a chance to see him a few times in practice this year Obviously played well against Presbyterian in the exhibition game 610 A lot of length for the Tigers this year Tigers bring in three players of 610 stature Davidson and Wen in the starting lineup and a guy checking in right there with the headband Carter Welling was at UC Irvine then Utah Valley for a season and now he is expected to fill an important role and they think he can help him inside but also can step out Wallen knocking down the free throw 67 a year ago for the Utah youths in the Big 12 Hell get a rest Brad Brownell saying this morning hed probably play 11 guys tonight with the game still on the line Tigers have bounced out to a sixpoint lead here First ever meeting against New Hampshire Third time Clemsons played an America East squad They had meetings against UNMBC and then just a couple of seasons ago here in Little John against the Bryant Bulldogs from Rhode Island Posair out high Robinson and Zack Foster going for the reach highly regarded fourstar freshman Weve seen two shot clock violations so far for a New Hampshire team that wants to play at an uptempo pace And so much of that too is that Clemson has been able to score the basketball in the paint So New Hampshire unable to get out in transition Clemson keeping their body in front using their length making New Hampshire score over the top Jose gets it out on the wing RJ Kennedy just into the game So is K Amobore gets it to Kennedy cant get the bounce and its Tiger freshman Chase Thompson 68 applause out of the state of Minnesota with the rebound but on the other end going to get a foul and a second quick one on the freshman but Ill give you an interesting stat on the Wildcats nine new guys but not a single senior on the roster six juniors four of them were transfers really interesting but thats college basketball now in 2025 and this is one of those games thatll get them ready for conference play as a legacy in Tiger program is on the ball defending Ace Buckner the son of the great Greg Buckner 10 on the shot clock for New Hampshire Still far from the hoop Amobore Hes down low Now it goes outside just into the ball game and driving to the hole unsuccessfully Giannis Xanthopoulos And back over to the Tigers once again No flow for New Hampshire offensively And you mentioned Ace Buckner Really impressed with him early in practice this year His ability to create his own shot Hes been one of those guys in practice uh thats been a pleasant surprise last year during his red shirt year but also early this year Butter Johnson bottom of your screen just in Hunter on the drive and hes fouled and so much of it early in the year Pete is going to be about getting to know these 112 new guys And Im going to give you another one thats been really good is Chase Thompson Mr basketball in the state of Minnesota last year Was a quarterback at his high school won a state championship but has a tremendous basketball IQ Knows how to play Has shot the ball well from three Got a body that you typically dont see from a freshman Really strong guy Been impressed with him so far this year in practice Hunter 62 from the line a season ago and he puts the Tigers up by eight Each team kind of trying to find it offensively A little fullcourt pressure to disrupt employed here but New Hampshire has had shot clock violations and had guys far from the basket out of position for the most part so far But they havent had live ball turnovers Pete Its been shot clock violations Theres three of them but it havent been the turnovers that lead to layups on the other end Kennedy cant get it to go and going way up there pulling it down Carter Welling gets it back from Hunter Buckner Ah Buckner scores in Little John again Its great to see I love seeing that 21 out there in a Clemson jersey the retro jerseys right now I text with his dad Greg Buckner just the other day when told him how well his son was doing I know hes proud of him Amore backing inside goes up over the freshman Thompson and that snaps a Clemson run Tigers were on a seven and0 run before that bucket Buckner now Welling Strong move STEP AROUND AND A THROW DOWN He left Zanthopoulos in his dust Really strong move right there by Carter Welling Used his pivot foot well able to finish at the rim Talking to the freshman out high defending the Hofster transfer Robinson mentioned American East Conference a physical league Nathan Davis the head coach says a moore from way outside and Thompson comes away with it And this is the kind of game that could help them get ready for some of the physical play in a league that includes Vermont which is picked to win it These guys picked at the bottom but really with roster change you just dont know Another strong move to the bucket by Carter Welling and itll bounce up and head of the line Brad Brownell actually said and not doing a direct comparison but maybe he can give us kind of what PJ Hall gave us both inside and out the Tigers head coach winningest of all time and just eight wins shy of getting to 300 at the helm of Clemson Yeah the longest tenur head coach in the ACC right now owners of 10 school records at Clemson I was at practice about a month ago and I told him afterwards I thought he seemed really excited about this group Theres so many new pieces that you know what happens sometimes in college basketball and and Chase Hunter was so talented Ian Shefflin won so many games Those guys had heard coachs message for years and years This group was together for the first time Uh and I think he and the staff had really have really enjoyed just putting the pieces together and figuring out how to make it work Welling 65 for Utah Valley in the whack a season ago He was a defensive player of the year in that conference So well see his skills And boy Budda Johnson almost took one away from Kennedy Al Shakiri back on the floor for New Hampshire Spins on Welling Didnt get it to go Really nice spin move right there by El Shakri Got to his left hand just unable to finish Hunter gets a screen from Davidson Havent seen Davidson show his offensive might so far And a whistle and a foul Go against the Wildats Lets look at RJ Kennedy And you also see Dallas Thomas the red shirt freshman from Little Rock Arkansas checking in the game Got stronger last year while he was sitting out with Ace Buckner Really long athletic talented guy can shoot the basketball Five team fouls already on the Wildcats Under 13 to go here in the opening half Hunter kicks it on the wing Johnson pull up and eventually Al Shakiri comes away with it Theres a freshman from the state of New Hampshire Tyler Bike Had a fabulous career first at Trinity High out of Marramac New Hampshire Then a Philip Exit one of those good New England prep schools and hes going to give it an early try from outside Godfrey takes it off the floor Tigers in the front court Godfrey looking back door for Hunter Bike defending lob inside and theyre going to get Bike on the reachin foul Tyler Bike was quite the scorer in his New Hampshire Prep career Averaged 257 points per game He was a New Hampshire player of the year as a high schooler So a state that doesnt produce that much D1 talent they hope he can make an impact with his home state school And recruiting the prep schools up in the Northeast area has been such a huge emphasis for Nathan Davis and the staff They talked about it a little bit just the other day Uh prep school basketball in the Northeast um boarding schools kids that have gone up there got that extra year to prepare uh have really been able to come out ready to play college basketball Uh theyve been coached hard practices and Tyler Bike is another great example of that A Moore with a personal foul Seven on the New Hampshire team Dallas Thomas red shirted a year ago Highly regarded upon his arrival as a freshman You cant knock down the first free throw And when you see Dallas youre going to remember Chanty Wiggins Same body type really long uh maybe not quite the shooter from three that Chanty was but a really good defender as well And its just one of those things where I think everyone that watches Dallas Thomas you just keep waiting for that um that next big step and its coming because hes got so much potential Tigers grow the lead to 11 Four out of seven as a team from screaming the line Kennedy in the back court dogged by Buckner Now Shachery the Walker transfer crossing over Davidson defends fade away and Thomas comes down with the rebound Really impressed with El Shakiri in the post right now Been able to pivot get to a spot just unable to finish right now Godfrey strong move Al Shakiri bumped him Lets make sure RJ Godfrey is okay Took a hard hit but looks like he will bounce up Tigers have some newcomers who can score at the basket Carter Willington Welcome to Clemson big fella straight from Utah finish especially his athleticism uh particularly to be able to guard uh you look at some of the times whenever Clemson might have struggled just a little bit defensively I think that RJ Godfrey could have helped them right there with his athleticism but um its the new day and age of college athletics you can always go home Tigers an 11point lead it would be more if they were better than four of eight now from the free throw line Bradell has to like a program motto that he fits Grit once had a 12 rebound game against North Florida to Godfrey a year ago about four rebounds a game and scored just over six points for the Bulldogs But now hes back says he wonders why he ever left Makes one out of two a 164 advantage New Hampshire in a rut 0 for their last four Two for 12 in of the game and theyre 0 for six beyond the arc Al Shakiri looking to drive on Buckner contact and theyll get Ace Buckner the red shirt freshman with a personal But if youre on the New Hampshire staff right now and youre looking for the positive only three turnovers for the Wildcats and it was the three shot clock violations And so its a new roster Its the first game of the season There havent been live ball turnovers that in games like this can cause the game to really break open quickly The Wildcats have taken good care of the basketball Theyre just having a hard time with Clemsons length Three team fouls for the Tigers Eight for New Hampshire but they do have a deep roster do the Wildcats Kennedy out high Posair Thats not going to go Offensive rebound John ONeal One of their few returnees out of the state of Wisconsin 69 sophomore First bucket in a while Really good job by John ONeal Got up high for that offensive rebound Able to get it up off the glass to score Davidson the soft touch in the turnaround Thats his first bucket as a Tiger New Hampshire will keep They hope ONeal can make a jump after averaging about two a game last year Yeah really impressive right here John ONeal skies for that rebound able to score it You see Nick Davidson a little bit late right there on the uh rotation but able to score it on the other end Again Nick Davidson 15 points per game at Nevada last year Clemsons going to need something similar to that as they fill the void left by Victor Lockman cheering ONeal of New Hampshire season ago with all their injuries Scoring was an issue not going to go from the outside for a Richmond transfer Jack Graham Boy the lid remains on for the Wildcats 0 for seven beyond the arc now Buckner running the show Tigers trying to build on this 12point advantage Shot clock coming up on 10 Porter through the lane and he was fouled on his way up Nathan Davis in disbelief the New Hampshire head coach not far from the official who made the call And Pete there are a couple of new rules in college basketball this year You and I talked about it earlier today and you could see Nathan Daviss reaction Theres an emphasis that officials are going to reward the offense If that offensive player has taken that dribble and is moving towards the basket theyre going to give them an opportunity to finish at the rim The phrase they kept using in the offseason was they wanted to reward the offense They want to help score Porter 82 a year ago but he can only manage one for two A 196 advantage So Clemson seemingly slowly pulling away Coming up on the 10minute mark Back door grabbing it on the nice feed from El Shakiri is Graham His first bucket in a New Hampshire uniform And credit Graham Ace Buckners really pressuring the basketball right now Hes done a good job of being able to get New Hampshire into offense And knocked away El Shakiri doesnt have numbers Davidson hits the deck El Shakiri couldnt finish Ahead it goes from Wallin then Buckner and then Godfrey Great pitch ahead in transition by Jake Wallen Ace Buckner saw RJ Godfrey running the whole way Now high ONeal poser for New Hampshire looking for a seam Down low ONeal back out El Shakiri He is going to launch Not going to go Wildcats have yet to hit a threepointer in nearly 10 attempts Tigers work transition They can play with pace Still dont want to go with some good offensive sets Davidson working on El Shakiri El Shakiri wanted a wraparound foul but the bump will be called on the big man for New Hampshire Great defensive rebound allowed Clemson to get out in transition As youre watching this new team come together youre looking for trends And Im watching Ace Buckner right now His ability to pressure the basketball help Clemson get into transition Its helping their offense right now when in a half court I wouldnt say stagnant but not great either And so they need those transition baskets Davidson not only talented but credited for being a very smart player He will be certainly a glue guy down the stretch but fellow who shot 70 a year ago misses that one Ace Buckner not as tall as his dad who was about 67 And when Greg Buckner played here in the 90s had the great career The court was turned 90° under the old Little John Coliseum configuration before the big renovation a decade ago But all I can think about Pete when I see this uniform that his dad wore exact design in that 21 is the dunk against North Carolina in the Charlotte Coliseum Greensboro Greensboro I apologize To beat North Carolina one of the greatest in Clemson basketball history What a Friday night that was What a comeback victory for Rick Horns team as they started to grow the program in the mid to late 90s out high Robinson looking to cross over on Thompson And you see it right there Chase Thompson I know that thats a great move by Kon Robinson to get the finish but thats a really good job as well by Chase Thompson of being able to move his feet use his length And Im really impressed with New Hampshires ability when they get the ball down in the paint They do a great job of being able to use that pivot Got Chase Thompson off his feet Key John Robinson able to score it with his left hand Thats the second time hes done that Guy did a lot of winning in high school and hes made native Florida a couple of high school state titles gets a threepoint play and Robinson with five points 22 to1 feed inside Wallen from Foster who had been on the court had exit with a two quick personal fouls but now Wallen with some free throws upcoming think they might have gotten El Shankery foul and that will be a second on him And theyre going to take a look See if there was more than just a common foul Theyre checking it Yeah I think so Um and one of the emphasis this year is just the game flow Obviously the coachs challenge Well talk more about that later and each coach having one Previous play is under review for a potential flagrant foul But all we heard in the offseason from the officiating group was just we wanted to keep the flow of the game moving Cut down the the number of reviews But this is a great elbow cut Uh Clemson loves to play out of the elbow Its great curl right there by Jake Wallen Theyre looking at that right there from behind Did he grab him from behind and it would have been there or theyre maybe saying El Shak Okay For initial the top view it actually looked like might have been considered there So theres El Shakiri He got called from the personal He didnt make any act as if he was trying to take him down to the floor And there is a a a different emphasis this year in the groin contact And thats one of the other points of emphasis Obviously nothing like that right there Its just grabbing him by the hips Didnt really make a play on the basketball I think that thats one that we can just call as a common foul but well see what happens Tommy Moresy Isaac Barnett Chase Furlow our officiating crew Moresy with his back to us leading this group And the discussion continues again There was a grab Theyre probably determining what was the intention And its you know its its early in the season Im Im going to go with my level of disappointment One of the things they talked about was officials would go to music the monitor as a group of three to try to cut down the amount of huddling and discussion because were 27 music seconds from another media timeout Were going to see a a stoppage here shortly music as the discussion continues and well take a timeout here in Little John a 22 to11 Clemson lead in the opening half snorts flagrant one on El Shakiri for the grab So couple of free throws for WallE and then the ball for Clemson And you see what constitutes a flagrant one foul Yeah theyre going with the no legitimate play on the basketball Uh and so I issue my apologies They were having that conference It became a media timeout because it was under 30 seconds within But that is a point of emphasis this year They want to keep the game moving Men 23 starts for the Utah youths last season He was a 67 free throw shooter and the rugged Big 12 And he gets the roll Tigers have had their opportunities from the line Theyre now nine out of 15 Was clearly upgraded to a flagrant foul and Tommy Morris here a lead official They were kind to come over and tell us I guess they didnt tell the folks here in the arena You may have heard that in the background The Tigers keep the ball Welling Foster Couple of fouls early so he has seen limited minutes but huge upside for that freshman How about the veteran of the group Dylan Hunter cant get it to go and we get a foul on the rebound attempt And its a big big few minutes for Zack Foster right here They want to be able to help him get into a flow Hes so long talented top 70 recruit in the country Came from Woodward Academy in Atlanta where he played for coach Anthony Thomas the former Ferman Paladin but a really highlevel guy one of the highest rated recruits since PJ Hall Wen just picked up his first personal defending the ball out high John Robinson All the scoring for New Hampshire so far has come in the paint Uh its been rough from long range 0 for nine Robinson 0 for 10 as a team Good hustle by Graham but he couldnt save it for New Hampshire You are that guy So we told you 10 new players That includes transfers and freshman Then you have Buckner and Thomas who sat out last year So you see the breakdown Dylan Hunters the only one who really saw any minutes of worth And of course he got late hurt late last season and that was damaging to the Tigers cause you had a finisher point Pete as youre talking about Dylan Hunter just really excelled last year got the start against Duke at home big win went on to win eight in a row and then he gets hurt breaks his hand in the first half of that first ACC tournament game against SMU and offensively they werent quite right after that but we talked about Jake Wallen earlier just his ability ability to drive the basketball rebound it and now we see him make another three right there Thats going to be a big key for him Only made 27 threes last year at Utah Tigers need to shoot the ball well this year Almost 35 Hunter kicks in the corner Freshman not going to go and taking it off as it comes down to him is pos And thats one the Clemson coaches are going to talk to Zack Foster Shoot the first one He was open took the side step made it a little bit harder than he had to Zanthopoulos cant hit from long range Theyre 0 for 11 and now away from the ball the whistle And I think theyre going to get Giannis Xanthopoulos on the personal And Zanthopoulos is a guy that Nathan Davis and the staff are really excited about Played on the under 18 team just this past year uh when he was growing up in Greece Long talented has gotten much stronger this year really good looking basketball player Second personal foul 610 the biggest player on their roster Welling will try again And Utah Welling 610 240 lbs 65 for Utah Valley from the line last season and thats going to go So Tigers free throws have not been their specialty per se They are 10 out of 17 from the line Yeah and thats something that youve seen Brad Brownell teams do really well in winning those close games Coach Brownell and the staff wont be happy about the free throw shooting so far tonight Its been interesting and even watching some of the exhibition games because theres so many more of them televised now Youve seen teams really struggle from the free throw line early in the season Welling defending the ball out high Shot clock under five Just into the game Dylan Saunders and says take that He hit 37 playing for UNH last year after coming over from Iona Foster cant get the runner Wildcats trying to put together a run down by 14 Zack Foster using his speed right there You see that rebound pushed the ball in transition able to get to the rim Kennedy steps back wont go and flying in Butter Johnson who like the guy who just missed the shot has UAB in his past Now Foster got off his legs Welling took a shot to the face Looked like it was inadvertent contact from Saunders Clemson freshman class highly regarded Zack Foster exciting player Chase Thompson is a guy I think can really contribute Brad Brownell well talk big about him And theres also some size in this class as well Yeah all four of these guys really talented young guys Obviously Zack Foster the headliner of the group Ive been really impressed by Chase Thompson but Trent Steinhower is going to be a really good player down the road for Clemson Uh hes got a long frame Uh can score the basketball Shoots it well Just got to get a little bit stronger Welling makes it a 2914 game And he leaves a second short El Shanker back on the floor Picked up that flagrant one earlier 15point game Tigers jump down to an 82 advantage Pose Robinson trying to shake Porter cant finish Porter looking to push the pace Hunter crosses over Little runner Great job by Porter just being able to push the ball in transition Youve seen the Clemson guards do that really well Dylan Hunter able to get to the rim and finish Robinson has the ball in his hands a lot New Hampshire trying to figure out something Kennedy Porter defense goes low to Squire then back door El Shakiri got too far under and Welling able to save it Johnson first name is actually Efim but he goes by Heres Dylan Hunter and he misses the mark and out of bounds Back over to the Wildats Pete New Hampshires done a good job of cutting off of the basketball They had a post feed right there to El Shaker Had a back cut to the rim just unable to finish Really impressed with coach Nathan Davis and his team Again they they havent turned the ball over They havent had the live ball turnover Scoring against Clemsons length is hard but theyve played with some poise offensively Bike the freshman for New Hampshire brings it across Ace Buckner red shirt freshman for the Tigers defending And thats one thing youre going to see from Clemson early in the season Those guards are just going to keep rotating out there Pressure the basketball 94 ft Try to force tempo El Shakiri He misses Well what a disaster from beyond the arc One out of 14 Year ago they were just 33 on threes Whole different cast this season though for the Wildcats Godfrey feeding Buckner Strong move and he gets it a go Thats the second time Ace Buckner has been able to get to the rim and use his body to finish You credit his develop physically and how much stronger he is after that red shirt year Thats really impressive right there That really does remind me of his dad That move is a signature move for Greg Buckner Really elevates when he gets down there Jose move to the bucket No Squire on the offensive glass El Shakiri will try again Another miss from beyond the ark for the Wildats Big reason they trail here 3314 Tigers trying to make it a 20 plus lead Porter No Davidson couldnt get the follow And Porter coming out of it is fouled Is it on 23 and it looks like theyll get through a line Could turn out to be the best shooter the Tigers have And as I say that he leaves it short He was 82 last season but a guy who likes to take it to the rim So hell get to the line quite a bit Yeah Reminds me a lot of Chase Hunter whenever you studied his statistics He was in the top five in Conference USA in three different categories Minutes per game field goal percentage threepoint field goals made Guy that really impacted the game Porter with the free throw and the Tigers lead is 20 here in the opening half Graham hung up out high Now Robinson trying to shake Buckner The Wildcats head coach expected to play nine tonight I think weve seen that many Emil gives it off Shot clock low and theyre going to turn it over again Take your pick Shot clock violation or Poseer losing it out of bounds And once again a possession lack of flow And that sums it up right there What that guys thinking Nathan Davis not happy They were really working on being precise during their shootound earlier today They did their shoot around up in the practice facility not out here Ive always wondered if that impacts it Im sure theyve gotten some practice time here in the arena since they arrived on Sunday but they they actually did not practice here in the arena There is Davidson showing you he can step out as well He was 37 beyond the arc a season ago Yeah Nick Davidson made 46 threes at Nevada last year Second team all Mountain West Conference We talked about it in music the opening His ability to shoot the ball is going to be key Graham lost the handle but a foul will be called against Clemson Tigers committing a 16 foul RJ Godfrey Check out Davidson setting up Yeah the ball got reversed from one side to the other Porter on that quick swing Nick Davidson no hesitation right there to shoot the basketball And one of the emphasis for the coaching staff so far uh during practice in this preseason has been they need Nick cheering Davidson to be aggressive offensively Hes such a high IQ guy He can move the basketball really well but they need him to look for a shot Graham in his first season after arriving from Richmond Didnt play a whole lot for the Spiders Went to a prep school growing up in Rhode Island He was actually the New England Prep School player of the year a few seasons ago That one comes out and Godfrey skies for the rebound Tigers a 23point lead coming up on two to go here in the opening half Davidson for Buckner who loads up and staying on the floor but pulling it in ONeal Nice block out of Davidson Wildats Rough start for them Just six of 28 from the field Robinson low in the lane out high Graham leaves that one short Another miss from beyond the arc Theyre one out of 16 on three attempts And the other part with that too Pete Clemson held Presbyterian to one of nine from three in the exhibition just just over a week ago So obviously the one of 16 is is disappointing but but Clemson defense has something to do with that as well John ONeal picks up the foul for New Hampshire Thats his first Davidson gets that one a go Hes picked up his scoring after a slow start Coming up at halftime we will pay tribute to one of the greats ever in ACC basketball men or women The former great Clemson Tiger Barbara Kennedy Dixon Recently announced for the womens basketball hall of fame Shell be enshrined postumously in June Such a great player an even better person her many years of service to Clemson as a coach administrator Don Mson visited with Jim Davis who got to know Barbara Kennedy Dixon quite well She was part of his staff And Barbara was a part of the athletic department when I was a player here Always someone that when you went into the McFaden Athletic Center always had a smile on her face greeted every athlete that came through the building Just always a delight to be around Youre allowed to Tigers can reach the 40point mark in this opening half 25point advantage quickly to Johnson That comes off no good Godfrey on the offensive glass and the finish Great patience right there by RJ Godfrey Able to sky and get the rebound Took his time got his balance underneath him and scored the basketball Clemson just three of 10 beyond the arc or this thing would be even more lopsided Robinson a hesitation cheering and Johnson stepping right in front Pretty move near midcourt trying to step around Jose and the foul is called Really impressive right there by Johnson got the turnover able to get out in transition Nick Davidson running with him trying to get the dump down just unable to The Tigers will head back to the free throw line As a young fellow Butter Johnson got the nickname were told from one of his older relatives I believe it was an uncle When you think about it as a basketball player we were talking about this in our office he could maybe say hes smooth as butter as he knocks down the first free throw 87 a year ago had him second on the UAB team And again he was there with RJ Kennedy of New Hampshire I had a chance to meet some of Buts family about two weeks ago Coach Brownell and the staff they bring all the family in for a Saturday practice Great to meet them Theyre really proud of their son and they should be nearly a turnover coming up on half a minute to go before the break Tigers will see Nathan And when you talk about the last just couple of seasons for Clemson basketball and the success that theyve had 74 and 30 Uh just unbelievable Fourth winning his program in the ACC cheering Ton of success for the Tigers over the last couple of years Step back Robinson Rebound inside ONeal and on the wing Itll go out of bounds Buckner last to touch it So New Hampshire will keep You see the differential 5 seconds Game clock to shot clock Pete Ive been really impressed with Ace Buckners activity on the defensive end of the floor Really pressures the basketball gets a lot of deflections It bode well for the Tigers Shot clock at five Graham music Shot clock at two Hell fire from the baseline And did they get it off in time They did Zanthopoulos the putback Johnson near midcourt And thats how we arrive at the break Tigers were 241 a year ago when leading at the half And theyre up big here 40 from Kentucky and won an exhibition game by 14 over the Wildcats Thats going to be a good one Wildats to start out in the second half El Shakiri one of their transfers limited at Waford a year ago due to injury Theres a Hustra transfer K John Robinson Now Posair looking to feed low Squire Shot clock again low for the Wildats Posair thats not going to fall Long rebound taken by Godfrey Hunter quickly to Wallin Clemson switching a lot of actions right there defensively in that first possession So now its what are you working on in the second half They want to communicate They want to be effective defensively RJ Godfrey a little bit too far off of that shooter in that last three cheering Graham giving up a little bit of size and Godfrey going over him Strong move as he rattles home the first basket of the second half Squire second season with them or I should say his first season with them came from Pepperdine and Graham the Richmond transfer inside Squire reacted as if he was surprised to get the ball and he turns it over Yeah RJ Godfrey has done such a good job developing as a low post scorer Catches the basketball takes his time able to get to his spot right there backs it down gets to his left shoulder Really nice job by RJ Godfrey right there Good work Justin Porter Godfrey Hunter on the wing Quick pass Porter and it comes down to Squire Porter almost looked like he was a little surprised I think he thought Wallen was going to shoot that basketball right there Little slow to be ready to shoot Tigers still plus 10 in the rebounding category El Shankery And the foul will be called inside Theyll get Godfrey Thatll be a second on the Tiger then the Georgia Bulldog and now again a Clemson Tiger Yeah these last couple of possessions OB New Hampshire hasnt scored it but theres been a couple of things defensively from Clemson that they would like to do a little bit better That possession before they were slow to rotate on the baseline Ball got down to the block just unable to finish Then right there just a late rotation and a and a lazy foul for lack of a better way of putting it Just reaching in 29point lead New Hampshire trying to get a little bit closer Robinson out to Graham Hell fire from long range Thats not going to go One out of 20 on threes for the Wildcats Hunter open Pose went for the rebound and were going to get a foul and its going to go against the native of Italy one of the few returnees who saw significant minutes for them a year ago New Hampshire continues to compete right there on the glass Tigers got it kicked out right there to Dylan Hunter just unable to knock it down We talked about it at halftime Pete You wanted to see Clemson execute defensively and then be able to make shots on the perimeter Tigers have hit just three threepointers Godfrey low block working on Squire Good job defending for the Wildcat Big man cheering El Shakiri Davidson defends Robinson cheering 10 on the shot clock for Robinson left elbow and another rebound RJ Godfrey got seven on the night that leads the Clemson team and a much better defensive possession right there by the Tigers Porter the catch and shoot Justin Porter he will supply that His first made three as a Tiger and the lead grows to 4816 And we talked about it earlier Pete He made 84 threes last year you at Middle Tennessee State Thats something hes really going to have to bring to the Clemson lineup this year Wallin defending out high on Robinson cheering Gets a screen now Flicks on the wing and thats not going to fall for Pose Another miss Jose for four beyond the arc He shot 40 last season Out of bounds Itll stay in the offensive end And you can see head coach Nathan Davis stays calm on the sideline We were talking about it a little bit earlier today He knew that this was going to be a growth experience He wants his teams to play fast and so he places an emphasis on being patient offensively with his team Theyve gotten some good looks from three just havent gone in Theyre going to make those in the American East Conference later this year Another foul on El Shakiri Now well get to see Justin Porter back at the line Frustration for the native of Egypt for New Hampshire Yeah El Shaks just had some some bad fouls earlier in the first half and obviously that one right there just closing out of control Leads to the foul and the Tigers will go to the line for three applause Porter hit one from beyond the arc moments ago Now a chance to add two more to get the Tigers past the 50 point mark Clemson a year ago 761 points per game they outscored opponents by better than 10 a contest and they were really good at the line 77 as a team cheering and that followed up the 2324 campaign when they shot 78 as El Shachi will take a seat So we pointed out earlier Brad Brownells teams have really become good free throw shooters consistently yeartoear Some fullcourt pressure applied in a 5116 game And those stats that you mentioned Pete those are the margin stats that really impact winning particularly those close games in conference play Tigers have excelled in that in the last couple of years A welcome three for Amobore Just a second made by New Hampshire K welltraveled came from Iona before that UCF but a North Carolina native had a really talented prep career Welling missing wildats from one of the few times tonight a chance to score in backtoback possession cheering Squire sets the screen He looked to get it back from music Robinson but good defense by Godfrey Another one this time from the left wing and it rattles home for the Iona transfer Come Amobore He has now tripled the output on threes in his LAST TWO TRIPS BUT ANOTHER throw down for the big man Welling That high low pass has been such a staple of the Clemson offense for the last really five or six years PJ Hall Ian Shefflin then Victor Lock and now RJ Godfrey able to throw it the high low and it leads TO A DUNK applause A Moore working inside on Godfrey from the lane No Godfrey closing in on a 10 rebound night Thats his eighth FOSTER THE FRESHMAN OH he wanted some thrill Welling with scrappy play and the put back Good hustle Carter Welling native of Draper Utah So far in the game he has contributed eight Ball out of bounds Back over to Clemson Rough possessions continue for New Hampshire Tigers scoring both a far and near Justine Porter knocks down the three And then on the other end Carter Welling music for that sophomore season especially from freshman to sophomore year Could be a vital player This guy should be a vital player as the year goes on Zack Foster another freshman Thompson on the court with him Welling and feeds Buckner just like pop and itll go to the line And Pete lets talk a little bit about whos on the floor right now for Clemson Obviously five guys that did not play a single minute for Clemson last year Youve seen Ace Buckner continue to attack the rim right here again But youve got Ace Buckner on the floor whos whos been able to score it at the basket Chase Thompson Carter Willing the really talented Fost Zack Foster and then the red shirt freshman Dallas Thomas And so these minutes are really important right now Youre going to be able to get some stuff on film some things the staff can work on and talk about Look for these guys the some of these other guys off the bench to to finish this over the next 13 minutes Welling has eight points in his Clemson debut and the really only offensive threat so far tonight with the ball down low a moore and 3second violation of straddling the lane Nathan Davis has seen a lot of things go against this team tonight but the Tigers should be credited for that I think its important also to note that granted Davidson listed as a fifth year senior but a guy like Welling and Wallen two of the big transfers each juniors so if you can keep them here you got guys who not only arrive but theyre not one and done guys for you We can build something as this season progresses but also for next year Buckner had it knocked away on the contact from Kennedy Tigers have been efficient tonight Fewer than half a dozen turnovers so far That was their fifth Kennedy in the lane Tear drop runner Rebound Santhopoulos Good defense by the reigning Western Athletic Conference defensive player of the year Welling Yeah Yeah I think RJ Kennedy is a guy for New Hampshire thats going to really add an offensive punch to their team this season He red shirted last year at UAB Talking to head coach Nathan Davis earlier today high level scorer uh but hasnt played in a game in over a year A lot like a couple of the red shirt guys from Clemson able to get his feet back on the ground again tonight Tyler Bike runner has it rejected by his fellow freshman Foster Out of bounds it goes And New Hampshire will keep just 36 six on the shot clock One of the things with Zack Foster when you watch him is just his length Uh able to to guard on the perimeter Hes a good rebounder Great job right there moving his feet And then Ace Butner follows it up with a block of his own and taken away by Foster Steps around by little finger roll Zack Foster showing you the explosion Great job by those two freshman guards getting out in transition Started with a deflection on defense Tigers able to get out and run A Moore out front Kennedy cant get it to fall and out of bounds Back over to the Tigers it goes Check out the D that set up the O Yeah cheering great defense always leads to great offense Big deflection right there by the Tigers Gets it out in transition This has been an area that Clemsons really excelled these last couple of years They need those defensive deflections the rebounds the steals to ignite the offense Foster at 64 with that speed Hes got the ball on the wing Quick pass for Welling Contact will get the foul on Bike trying to help defensively And Welling is a big man at 610 240 Bike ran into him at 510 170 Carter Wellings body is just really impressive as you look at him Reminds you a little bit of Victor Lockan More of that type than Ian Shefflin Uh but skilled and obviously you talked about a really talented shot blocker just this past year at Utah Valley State Actually got El Shakiri on the previous foul There were three Wildats around and its interesting Pete we talked about it a minute ago just as these younger Tigers or newer Tigers stepped on the floor just a minute ago Same thing happened a little bit in the exhibition against Presbyterian when those guys checked in the game The energy level changed defensively Uh they were able to get out and run fly around defensively Buckner fouled by the man behind him Bike Each a freshman Buckner a red shirt and Bike a true freshman And each a legacy in his respective program Of course Buckners dad is Greg Hson Tiger and Bikes mom played womens basketball at the University of New Hampshire Craig Sour another one of the Tiger bigs another one of the newcomers on the floor getting to see some action They battled some ankle issues recently but saying hes a full go for tonight Another guy they think can help give him some quality minutes Yeah Ive been impressed with Trent Steinhower in practice His ability to shoot the basketball stretch the floor Going to be a talented player Out front Kennedy Thats got to feel good for him Yeah youre absolutely right Pete To see RJ Kennedy make that shot averaged 25 points per game in high school Uh needed to see that three go in Shes now one out of four beyond the arc Cuts the lead to 6225 Tigers reached out to an 82 advantage and havent looked back Heres Thomas driving Contact made and the defense by New Hampshires Anthropoulos Amobore across the lane forcing it Fouls going to be called Good setup inside out for New Hampshire that last time down Yeah we talked a lot about RJ Kennedy and his ability to score the basketball Big shot right there New Hampshire shot the ball better in the second half from three right now Been able to knock down some of those open looks cheering Kobo one of two former Iona Gales on their roster has arrived this year joining Philan Saunders who came from the new Rochelle New York school last season and Pete the American East Conference is not one that we hear a ton about down here in South Carolina but just study them this week Obviously the Vermont Catamounts have have really been successful in that league the last couple of years Bryant Bulldogs took the automatic qualifier a year ago but Im going to give you one the Maine Black Bears coached by Chris Markwood assistant from Nor Eastern University Hes done a great job with that program Well Shachery after the block by Graham trying to finish and hes fouled and its an offensive foul applause Full head will play home and away Youll play everyone else minus one for Clemson This year its Virginia and new head coach Ryan ODM Budda Johnson UAB transfer Hunter gets a nice screen from Godfrey Teammates again but it comes off wide to the rim Tigers led at the break 436 Graham screaming now a Moore Thats Wallen defending cheering Another deep shot clock for a team that does want to try to play with better tempo this season New Hampshires playing out of a five out What a lot of coaches call a chin action Trying to spread the floor trying to cut off of that You saw Clemson Jake Wallen got a dunk off of that action earlier in the game but Im impressed with Jake Graham I know he didnt play a whole lot at Richmond last Back to action Just 13 on the shot clock for New Hampshire Posair couldnt find the handle Another shot clock violation for the Wildats Really nice action there by Nathan Davis coming out of the timeout You had a curl into a screen the screener action Just didnt execute the pass well enough Nathan Davis trying to get back to what they were able to do in New Hampshires first year Lob inside Davidson Nice find by Godfrey RJ Godfrey very nice return Thats his third assist on the night And Nick Davidson in double figures in his first Clemson game has 10 points a year ago 27 doubledigit games at Nevada Really nice job there by RJ Goffrey You talked about the passing ability Third assist on the ninth Aobore hung up able to shake Davidson and knock it down Kobore having a good second half for the New Hampshire team Yeah Ks been a bright spot for head coach Nathan Davis Hes shown his ability to score the basketball He can drive it Made a couple of threes undersized defensively in a game like this but really competes hard on the defensive cheering end Like it was going down for Welling Aobore the first Wildcat and the leading scorer in this game First Wildcat in double figures 11 points Squire driving Davidson recovering Good block off the glass Really nice lefthanded drive there by Squire Davidson just able to recover with his length but thats a nice drive Hunter with Johnson out high Godfrey again a lob for Davidson Kicks in the corner WELLING screaming cheering Wallen rather able to hit it Kate Wallin newcomer for this Tiger ball club 36 a year ago when he played for the Utah Great ball movement right there by Nick Davidson They had the high low pass Kicked it out while able to knock down that three Thats his first three as a Tiger Clemson five out of 16 of the game beyond the ark Graham pulls up off the crossover Davidson nice box out on the rebound 10 points for Davidson Now he has five rebounds Tigers have been really good on the boards Plus 14 from the corner Johnson And thats a lot of what we talked about Pete You wanted to see the Tigers shoot the ball well in the second half Knocking down that three on backtoback possessions Great skip pass there by Nick Davidson Able to set up Butter Johnson for three Johnson called for the personal cheering Jake Wall What a good find to get him wide open in the corner earlier And then how about butter Yeah really nice job right there Great ball movement by the Tigers Balls moving side to side Uh theyre now up to six made threes Thats a great sign from head coach Brad Brown on the Tigers A 4316 lead at the break has grown to 42 points here in the second half coming up on eight and a half to go El Shankery returning to the upsay Former Wford Terrier spinning on Davidson cheering and Davidson defending well Yeah its another really good job though El Shaker got down to the post able to use that pivot foot just unable to score against the Clemson length Godfrey Swings it out to Hunter Hunter had time to think about it and El Shakiri pulls it down cheering Seven rebounds for Balo El Shakiri Thats him with the ball Wen defends Great activity right there by Dylan Hunter such a big part of his game last year in that support role Now hes got to go be the main guy for the Tigers Robinson feeding Squire Good find cheering for El Shakri Shot clock under five Robinson pump fake shakes Wallen leaves it short Jose Robinson out high working on Wallin And Jake Wallen will be called for the bump Timeout on the court 734 to go Tigers up the size and the length that theyre going to see against some other teams later this month and into the league play Thats a good job moving the basketball Wallen leads the Tigers with 11 The Moore has 11 for New Hampshire Thats Robinson trying to work on the freshman Foster and hes successful Think of how much better this team will be once they just get to know each other and 10 15 games from now theyll theyll recognize tendencies and when guys are playing off the ball how much better theyll be Justin Porter should be a huge factor Look at the hop step Cant get the jumper to go and Squire pulls it down And even just head coach Brad Brownell just comes with different waves of guys you know and so now theyve come come back to Zack Foster and Budda Johnson and now Carter Welling Its going to be a fun group to watch as they continue to develop over the month of November on other teams that have added a lot of new personnel Miami and NC State for example with Robinson working inside and hitting the deck looking uncomfortable was Johnson might have slightly twisted something Hes okay though But think about some other teams in the league that lost a lot of players and have a wholesale change to their roster Theyll be figuring it out And Im going to give you one more West Virginia hired a new coach completely new roster The Tigers will see them in about two weeks in Charleston And so its part of college basketball now Welling Justin Porter feeding Foster Follow Welling cheering Boy he really does elevate Biggest man on the team but adds a little with the jumping ability Yeah hes really been explosive Had a really nice dunk off of a pivot earlier in the game Great tip back right there as well Back out to a 40point lead and then New Hampshire turning it over Carter Welling get out of his way Great job getting to the offensive glass right here by Carter Welling I think its something that this team is going to have to do really well early in the year Theyve got an offensive rebound Id love to see Dallas Chase Thompson really add that to their game Thats an area those guys off the bench can help this team Even with all the work of Ian Shefflin a year ago Tigers were just plus 27 in rebounding Feed for Buckner Strong move El Shakiri cheering picks up the personal Thatll do it for him ACE Butner just continues to show his willingness to attack the basket and take on defenders Hes done a great job of just playing at the rim using his size and his strength Hell head to the free throw line right here Return to the upstate for the former Waford Terrier But his night is done as he fouls out with just under six to play Ace Buckner looking like he can be a factor for this Clemson team as he knocks down the free throw And on a night where the Tigers have gotten better as the games gone on Theyre now 23 out of 32 from the line And Buckner five for five Yeah I think some of that Pete is just its the first night Theres some excitement to it This teams going to shoot the ball well from the free throw line As you said theyve done a much better job here in the second half Buckner the reachin foul on Robinson And I think one of the Clemson folks was noting to me this morning during the shoot around that against Presbyterian the exhibition game So its the first game action for all these guys playing together for the first time It was almost like the first five six minutes everyones kind of wondering if the next guy was going to make a big play before they really kind of settled in and looked like they were comfortable playing together under a game situation Yeah absolutely But one thing that will always translate is is that ball pressure defensively And you see Ace Buckner right there Picks up the foul long way from the basket but continues to pressure the basketball Nice move by Graham Couldnt finish A Moore wins the battle with a couple of Tigers on either side And now weve got a whistle Tommy Morsy the lead official awarding the ball out of bounds to New Hampshire Im not sure if he thinks there was a shot clock reset issue or does he think perhaps the ball at the bottom of the basket A little bit confused as to what that was about Yeah I am too And I was watching coach Brownell He seemed uh content with the explanation Unhappy with the foul though Thats backtoback fouls right there by Clemson defensively Wants to see him play clean over this last 5 and 12 minutes Foster picks up a third personal Keep in mind he picked up a couple of quick ones when he entered in the first half Robinson forcing it Welling just too imposing on the defense But thats a really good job by Carter Welling right there Keon Robinsons a really athletic guard able to move his feet stay in front and then contest a shot without fouling Buckner pull up Pretty nice game for Ace Buckner It was interesting just talking to the staff last year They kept coming back to Ace Buckner and how well he played in practice especially the second half of the year Credit to that young man having a chance to come out here and show that hard work has paid off tonight 13 to lead the Tigers and to lead all scorers in the game Amobar cant get it to fall Welling another rebound Tigers with so many guys who played and again everyone whos been in the game with the exception of two able to score And how about Buckner Wow Doesnt have the size of his dad but has so many moves on the run around the basket Yeah you just saw that Yeah Yeah Ace Buckner does a great job creating his own shot Gets downhill right there Able to get to that pull up and then he gets to this next one right here able to get downhill plays well off the uh off the glass Again just watching him in practice he can create his own shot Really impressive Great debut for the younger Buckner tonight And itll come off no good A Moore with the rebound cheering Buckner arriving last year sat out out of Dallas Texas His dad spent many seasons with the Mavericks among his NBA stops Mhm Now with the Milwaukee Bucks coming up on four to go Shot clock again under 10 for New Hampshire Zanthopoulos Amobore set a couple of threes in this half Not that time And Foster and the Tigers bring it the other way Graham defending up top Dallas Thomas leaves it short Theyll get Posair on the foul Tigers have a second half of November for the Tigers You mentioned the trip to Washington DC and then the trip to Charleston for the Charleston Classic An event that has been very good to the Tigers Have won it the last couple of times Now a twogame event Used to be a threegame event but well see Xavier there Well see West Virginia Georgia So some really good teams in that event down in the Low Country Dallas Thomas extends the lead to 7932 cheering applause Tyler Bike out of Marramac New Hampshire One of two natives of the Granite State cheering on their roster Whistle away from the ball Foul inside Theyre going to get Steinhower freshman just outside of Charlotte trying to body up on Zanthopoulos 17 fouls in the half on the Tigers So we will see Giannis Xanthopoulos cheering trying to be the Giannis of America East Too strong cheering and rebound deflected over the Sauer Thomas looks like a good ball handler for a big man He Yeah talented long You want to see these younger guys for Clemson over this last three and a half minutes play well take care of the basketball and then play without fouling on the defensive end All freshman on the floor Steinhower cant get the runner True or red shirt as the young guys look like theyll close this thing out Drive inside a Moore No Steinhower battles and held ball Harold will send it back the other way And I know that they didnt finish the roll right there with Steinhower but Chase Thompson just showing that basketball IQ his skill Thats a great uh pocket pass hitting Trent Steinhower on the roll Buckner with the ball 15 points to lead all scorers Wine and Davidson also in double figures with 11 and 10 respectively Tigers just trying to work some clock and get these freshman used to game action because the two red shirts on the floor Didnt see game action a season ago and taken away Zanthopoulos and then Thomas Balls fluttering all over the place Zanthopoulos changing hands Finishes with the left hand Really nice finish right there by Zanthopoulos Able to get out running in transition finishing at the rim Really promising prospect for the Wildcats Well their head coach says they play in a physical league and you would think Zanthopoulos with that height will help their cause out of bounds and New Hampshire gets it back Great job running in transition right here by the Wildcats We mentioned the youthfulness for them and they want to play fast Obviously not able to do that as much tonight against the Clemson Lymph Want to pick up the tempo get out and run But thats a great job by the young 610 freshman being able to finish at the rim Anthony Sherukq native of Poland another international player on their roster Just checked in Thats him with the ball Theyve also brought in Miles Blackley freshman out of Summit New Jersey Thousand point score in high school Kennedy trapped down low Try to get in the lane of Sharoo Foster and the Tigers take it away Oh look at that little cradle crossover Then a reverse went right past Pike Thats one of the best parts about Zack Foster when you watch him in transition He doesnt run he floats You know you just see the way that hes able to guide slide right there in transition Uh just makes this move right here effortlessly Really nice finish right there by Zack Foster Id like to see him on the other end though Stay in front of the basketball play without fouling right now Uh cheering keep the ball in front Mike cant get it to go Look at Buckner Sky pulls it down And again going way deep on the bench tonight Brad Brownell but this is going to be common place for this team He expects to play a lot of guys Every player on that roster will see cheering minutes while the game is on the line Get a foul against the Wildcats So we showed you Clemsons upcoming schedule The mighty battle against Curry College is Thursday on the Durham campus Then down to Boston Not a terribly long drive Another road trip at George Mason in the DC area And I was talking to Coach Davis earlier today They won six league games in the American East Conference last year but only two nonconference They had to uh they were pulling guys off of campus to try to have enough to practice So I say that to say the nonconference schedule is really important for this team as as coach continues to build that program Want to have some more success than what theyve had Theyve been good in America East Want to have some success in the nonconference this year cuz they open with a really hard one when Vermont comes to call in that opening game for them this year in league play Vermont again picked to win another league title Got a foul inside Things getting a little bit rough down there with Zanthops and Steinhower New Hampshire a year ago the eight wins three of them by three points or less So they had to win some close games And again they had a depleted roster So guys like Zanthopoulos and others will add talent And again in their league I can see where theyll fit in whats a physical conference America East And its a skilled conference You know we talked about Vermont we talked about Bryant um Maine you know some really good basketball programs up there a lot of kids that cheering went to prep school up in the northeastern area So some really good teams Jamon Christian uh making his return to college basketball this year at Bryant Uh was a head coach at several places Uh coached in Italy for a couple of years Makes his return with the Bryant Bulldogs this year Excited for Jam Young Buckner hung up by Kennedy Under a minute to go ACE BUCKNER GOT IT AND HES FOULED applause and cheering 17 points in the

this game later tonight Whether hes at home or traveling hes gonna be proud of his young son He was the star of the slab five was Greg Buckner and he and Rick Barnes arrived together Feed underneath lost and Foster comes away with it Reaching foul by Kennedy But Greg Buckner with Ear Turby with the addon to the slab five Bill Harter and Merl Coat Andy Kennedy and Rayfield Raglin and Bruce Martin And those seven with Patrick Sap coming over from football and giving him some minutes and a few others built the foundation made the NIT that year and lost to a Virginia Tech team I think thats the year Virginia Tech made a run to uh to the NIT championship They had to go face former Clemson coach Bill Foster in the opening round But after that three straight NCAA tourney appearances for Rick Barnes to round things out in his time with Clemson Under 30 to go Kennedy penetrating on Buckner Quite a night for Buckner 18 points Finishing down lows Anthropopoulos Good stretch run here He finished with eight points Tigers will dribble it out first ever meeting against the New Hampshire Wildcats will be a 50point win cheering 8838 will be the final score as Punson starts the season with
