P the basket down to three on the shot clock Carr has it STP by long and Music airball 30 seconds in the stance for Virginia Tech and they get an opening stop each team starts in the manto man in Virginia Tech they really like to cut off those driving Lanes Virginia Tech with a stop on their opening possession they went to this starting lineup today with MJ Collins in it with that in mind their best defenders trying to slow down one of the best offensive teams that theyve seen to this Applause point Tech they like to spread the court they move you around they do set a lot of screens and Lin kid in particular does a great job rolling off of the ball scen pullet into the post and this has gone down the other way on the travel and thats what Wake Forest wants to do Virginia Tech is trying to force you to switch theyre trying to force you to come and help so that then they can exploit that by moving the ball and getting an open shot and so far Wake Forest these first two possessions theyve played it perfectly after the shot clock violation down this way on forz first possession into re HT with the hook car with the offensive rebound no Reed on the P Applause round great Forest is not a great offensive rebounding team but when you get that many chot and you get a chance that close and you miss it its hard get the defensive re youre laughing cuz you knew it thats a foul on HRI as first it wont be the first aggressive play that hild wont be the last aggressive play that hildr makes today hildr is a guy who plays so hard hes so competitive he really gets after it it looked like he was talking to himself like come on man thats what I always do going be a foul re going oneonone with kid after the takeaway and backing him in and the slow break but thats the Reed thats really a good play by Reed didnt force anything took his Applause time he had a double double in his debut against rur and was close to another one against Presbyterian n days Applause ago Virginia Tech looking for the first basket and kid knocks it down for the midrange and kid is very good in the midrange Music welcome to Wake Forest for ACC restart Conor onion with Dan Bonner opening minutes Wake Forest and Virginia Tech with wake playing their first game in the ACC and itll be ly kid going to the free throw line right off jump with our new audience in this was a very good game last year came down to the final possession twopoint weight Forest win and both teams come in playing well Dan Virginia Tech theyve won four straight Wake Forest is w six Music St Sean padulla was out injured last game he turns it over at point guard for Virginia Tech again W for doing a nice job staying in front of their Applause man thats off the T out of bounds hope keeps the demon what we just saw as we joined as we joined was the fact that the Virginia Tech threw the ball into ly kid and Reed fou him and Fon Reed he has a history of being foul prone so were going to have to watch that because Virginia Tech is going to throw the ball inside to L kid reputations around the floor having threepoint Shooters around but youve got your eye on the post players today well theyre guys you can shoot three but the attack really is a team that to go inside first car backing his way in that is off of him and going back to the hook thats part of that you know maai long with a little bit of quickness right there Carr trying to back him down use that size and long reaches in there and slaps the ball off his leg Mike young going with a little bit of a different look in the starting lineup today started MJ Collins a little bit more defensive minded re Steiner in at point guard coming off a terrific game Collins fler short the rebound for H the Hokes really anxious to get back defensively and H ping his way in you have to stop hildr out by the free throw line because particularly in transition if you let him get down into the lane he is going to do that every time and heres a known contr portion IST H three on the way long heavy and Reed got a hand on it but off the Dem deacons and out of bounds Captain Reed with the takeaway they call this the slow break backed his way in in transition he has four early points for the Demon Deacons now I was asking Mike young this morning does it make the Friendship complicated he said not not as much as you would think cff heads to the free throw line for the demon deons Wake Forest theyre Relentless about trying to get the ball inside we talked about their quickness but they everybody they have on the court basically can post up and hild is a very difficult post up matchup for most teams well hrth continues this climb last year was the big jump they an even bigger jump from last year almost 16 points a night for him again he is very aggressive hes very competitive hell drive the ball to the basket he can shoot the perimeter shot and I mean he works so hard on defense as well and hes a great great free throw shooter top 10 in the ACC and H 84 shooter sinks both of them and now hell get arrest with Parker Frederickson into the game theres a high level shooter coming off the bench Parker Frederickson we seeing a home state friend sha padulla from Oklahoma the point guard for Virginia Tech Frederickson has known him for a while as pulla has to miss rebound Miller heres one of the fastest guys on the floor Miller gave it Applause up now Salis on the attack and strong Drive earns in free throw its a strong drive but again its the quickness by Wake Forest we said they like to spread the court theres not a lot of screening activity going on and Salis just takes the ball and hes a little quicker than nickel and just beats him Sal its a very similar graphic to what we just showed with hildr just at a different School zaga for a couple years well Salis was an interesting guy he played in 69 games against zaga didnt start any averaged about 4 and A2 points a game and here he comes in here and hes averaging 18 a Music game and the interesting thing about Salis is he did not shoot the three very well at fin sagga but he has shot it very well here at White for from there padulla that is his fourth turnover just dribbled the ball out of bounds and I think quickness has really been a problem for Puda early we saw Mike young take him out of the game and put Rex Steiner in there after the first three turnovers well that was just to get his attention now padulla hes a little bit of a swashbuckler type he likes to take risks car oneonone on Baron and he Applause finishes so far the hokes have not helped when that ball is gone inside and the deakes have been able to take advantage Mike Youngs teams at Virginia Tech known for taking care of the ball and making threes they giving it away and not hitting early and theyre in a 10 uh 10point Music Applause hole we can see the help leaves and baron is on his own there and Carr is an excellent back to the basket player and if he gets that close and youre not going to help out against him hes going to score a lot of points look at this Miller icing in got that shot up but off the rim to poti now padulla looking around for help coming with him and canor a deadly threepoint shooter going high upstairs it goes down Salis is doing a great job running Couture off the threepoint line but H Couture is more than just a threepoint shooter he is the the best as far as career threepointers at Virginia Tech like you said hes turned into much more than that they rely on down on this end too quick step Miller leaning in no followed his Zone and the fight for it ends up in Padulas hands Virginia Techs problem is theyve struggled to get easy baskets curo is R off the line again and Pati in tight nearly lost that ball but thats an excellent recovery and a really good catch in traffic by Pati and the shot chart would tell you the last two shots have been easy ones but they werent contested out by the rim Miller slices it again he went right by padulla Padulas complaining that he felt Miller used his arm to push off Elite quickness from Miller knocks that out Bas line out for the Applause H Miller I mean he just p is not fast enough padulla expected him to go into the lane and Miller went the other way and padulla just couldnt move his feet quickly in all looked like the guys in the Wake bench are telling them exactly that keep taking him to the rim what do you do if Virginia Tech defensively put another guy on him well I dont think so I think you know Sean padulla is a guy who can handle him Padulas got to give him a little bit more room force him to shoot the jump Music shotor theres a tight shot rebound for PA cout doesnt need a lot of time and room but maybe a little more than that thats great defense and thats a block Roger a is right on top of the call and Robbie Baron called for the foul and this is this is hildr again I mean he just he is a wrecking crew out there and baron got called for that block because once you establish your guarding position you can maintain it or you can move backwards or side to side but he moved right in so that was a very clear block Barons first he takes a seat after that Salis on padulla and that Salis is also very quick but he also has a couple of inches on padulla and Salis is really good getting into the lane with that little Applause floater coming off 11day rest for the fo injury and poti down to the floor and Keller with good energy down there to tie it up the crowd loves that from Keller in Winston Salem Wake Forest and their ACC opener up 10 right now get a down at the bottom there no threepoint baskets made in this game in fact wake hadnt attempted one yet your thought with how theyre taking it to the basket by would you heres kid for his first dunp and again kid is going to be a problem on the inside he moves so well he catches it so well and once he catches it he knows exactly what to do with it Mike young said that if he plays like he did in their last game when he had 31 points he is going to make a lot of money here be rich rich big fell Frederick CN the first Applause three and he is the best threepoint shooter on this Wake Forest team you cant get him that kind of power late coming out and a foul on the attack for Tyler Nicholl the interesting its an interesting problem for Virginia Tech theyve been beaten off the dribble by W Force so you got to give him some room but Frederickson is not a guy who is going to beat you off the dribble so you got to get out on him theres one guy youre running off the line its that guy frericks this is Virginia Tech from the foul line theyre one of the best teams in the ACC and in the country not only getting to the free throw line but making them when they get their top 10 at 79 well they really do a nice job making free throws and I mean free throws are about a quarter of their offense 24 of the Virginia Tech offense comes from the free throw line so you would prefer to keep them off the line if you could nickel with the Miss hes been a big part of that high percentage for theam at 76 him on that W foris last time down hit their first three of the game Tech trying to slow down its been a heavy driving start for the Demon Deacons deep position for Reed and thats you just cant let him get that kind of deep position lead with six already in his first career ACC game Collins off balance kid there and through the contact L on El takes the away here he comes zigzagging all the way in the F put down for Applause marot watch the roof in Winston Salem Marcus Marion flying in timeout H when game time runs into dinner time a hero must run and just getting it up on the board is what enabled Maran to secure it just a really good fast break by w a lot of action coming at the rim for the Demon Deacons and off of turnovers eight nothing in points off turnover through the back to long is underneath thats the Dilemma that you have when you play against kid you know do you go and double team because hes a pretty good passer and that time he didnt kick it out for a three but long doing a nice job moving without the ball gets that seems to be the start of the conversation with every opposing coach that play for attack and Reed steps out and hits one thats his first one in a Wake Forest Music Applause uniform hes 0 for five from Deep coming in Miller with the quick hands and nichel recovers for Virginia Tech and hes fouled Applause again weve seen Reed operate very effectively down on the inside and if youre Lyn kid youre going to give him this one until he makes a couple because thats his first one as a demon Deacon and he did not shoot a high percentage either at Gonzaga or LSU a point presumably up to his mom whos here watching him today said when he got eligible and the NCAA radio is eligible a few weeks ago his mom was at first and there were tears he cried on the other end of the phone as Rex Steiner into the lane for the Applause h hookies need to have more of that and by that I mean attacking the basket obviously need to make some baskets but they got to get the ball going toward the goal re Steiner Mike young says just flat out fun to play with how he shares the ball the energy that he gives Virginia Tech coming off an 11 assist game getting late in the clock got to get busy here hild and two on the clock and hildr got to the rim and it sits down W theres nothing wrong with that defense that time HRI just made one very very tough play Go fullback into the lane B full backs not Applause dead single coverage and kid wins it on MAR it appears that if youre going to do single coverage on either one of these guys that youre asking for trouble wake for six early points lead has nine including a three tough shot HRI follow M and long away this is where Virginia Tech when they get a rebound they need to push it up and see if they can get an easy one good job by wake to get back and the LA into to kid draws the foul on Reed and that is huge that is two on Fon Reed who has nine fouls heres the fullback type action little nudge from hildr in a kind Music Rim picked up his second foul this is what theyre missing now D well he has been the main factor in this game hes four out of five with he shooting for the most part hes been inside but for heaven sa he stepped out and he hit a three hes got a couple of rebounds and again he had this is the three hit but he picked up his second personal foul so its a little under 7 and 1 half to go in the half hell likely sit with that stat line until halftime itll be on the other bigs including Zack Keller to try to slow down Lyn kid and Robbie Baron and Keller has the defense behind kid forces the turnover little too hot to handle kid turnover for Virginia ATT seven turnovers is a lot for Mike young team Miller used his body swirls out faen play Above the Rim tell who else used his body and that was Rex Stein he did a really nice job being physical with Miller but not drawing the foul I know you were impressed by what we saw from Rex Steiner in that last game seven assists most in two years for a Virginia Tech playoff late clock Collins working on Frederickson kid and cant throw off the tou that time and a kid had a hard time catching the ball inside he caught it he was off balance he was two feet from the basket and wasnt able to get a shot of you think this would be kids time to try to take over with two in two possessions they flown a to him twice and once the ball dropped off J coutur was right with hildr all the way good defense hildr I think was looking for a foul that time H is not somebody to back down you know hes going to get the ball in there and hes going to try to force it to the goal he went right over to one of the officials after that probably saying come on he hit me a good hands for Salis two on two oh the Quick Step Salis follow par on the third Drive well and thats got to be something thats going to upset Mike young because they had three shots at it and wake Force just beat Virginia Tech down the Applause Music court Virginia Tech has won four straight since backto back losses against qua Atlantic and against Auburn and Dan those were games that they got beat up in the pain of a little bit what problem today is theyre turning the ball over and this is a situation where Salis hes going to go for the tip and he misses but now the next guy down the court is Carr from Wake four and a foul and coutur is holding his ankle hildr came in and fouled him and Couture stays down grabbing his right lower Applause leg its one of those situations where he landed on hilberth and turned his ankle over and you see Couture hes trying to place that shoe up tight cuz he wants to go and shoot those free throws hildr has really been done a great job defensively against Couture but Couture hes got the wide open shot and he just steps on his foot nothing intentional by hildr there but hes just hes trying to bother the shot Couture comes right down on it laced up a little tighter Couture staying in after hildr just committed his second foul Couture is a 90 free throw shooter so you certain one hes the guy you wanted the Applause line shots so far unbothered by that ankle but H dri goes to the bench the second foul joining Fon Reed who has two fouls so two starters for the Demon Deacons and he scored early in this game sitting now Andor makes all three after H second they picked up those fouls but I think its been their aggressiveness thats been W for aggressiveness thats been a key to this first half sometimes your aggressive you foul foul off the ball Baron and car fighting down there that be a foul Baron said that cant be a foul what do you say Dan boner well Im not the guy with the whistle and those are the guys that decide and they decided it was now thats only the sixth foul it was number two on Baron so he checks out long into the game with that four spot for the hokes Salis whirling in and oh balance that bounce plus the foul thatll make a gasp then that was some play and I was watching Couture because hes got that you know hes turned that ankle and you wonder how that was going to affect his ability to move laterally no problem here this is just a great play by Salis I mean off balance fallen down helped down by Couture but that is a great play by Salis the most impressive part might have been the backward Summers all of that youll get any points for that though you dont give two tag in the first foul in Hunter cus a real struggle on the offensive end trying to get kid going with the left no Keller there to pend him off K looks a little frustrated to me Keller just did a nice job maintaining his position for kid to shoot over Virginia Tech still does not have a three in this game Salis not here the rebound snatched by K great job getting back and setting their Music defense the defense is shutting out the Hokies the last three and A2 minutes and ker did it Applause again Tech PCH thinks that was a foul right on the reack Miller no suddenly everybodys gone cold almost four minutes without a basket for Virginia Tech and padulla changes that that was a very tough shot that was pretty good defense by Miller and Virginia Tech theyll take it whether its an easy shot or a tough shot they need the ball to go in the basket Virginia Techs not shooting a a bad percent of 25 but its been the turnover turnover and a hand check on pulla on the Miller Drive W Forest by 12 trying to win their seventh straight game for the first time since 2009 right wake for will be an NCAA tournament team with the best starting five in the ACC according to those guys you agree well I dont think Seth is wrong because with this starting five with Reed in the game we saw we see what he can provide offensively and he is a great presence defensively as well this is a one and one and Miller earns the bonus what a womens college basketball triple header we have for you next Sunday one Eastern on ESPN number one South Carolina in Mississippi State number seven LSU in Old Miss then ESPN 2 caps today number 2 for North Carolina number 13 Notre Dame in South Music Applause B Miller hits him both he has six first half points and this pressure almost forced another turnover verginia Tech has eight turnovers in this first half they average 11 on the year game wide and I think its the speed of Wake Forest that has really affected Virginia Tech on both ends of the Court and that is a five call R Forest almost forced it that first time and thats the ninth turnover for Mike young you know that is burning him inside hands its hard to its hard to play on the road when you turn the ball over nine times in Salis with resistance from nickel back out for Miller on the take on padulla and thats a charge pulla takes it on the chest on B Miller thats just a great job moving his feet that time he talked about what can he do well he plays off a little bit just moves his feet and he once you establish leg legal guarding position youre allowed to move to maintain it so thats his second foul you have three wake for his players right now on the Flor SC with two fouls but again the pressure and the aggressiveness that caused those fouls has really disrupted vir t on both ends of the quarter let see if they go after one of those guys Miller on the ball here has two and coutur is only attempted Two Shots here in the first half theyve done an outstanding job against him that was a real tough one thats Salis influence her Applause pulla hildr and Reed all with two fouls on the floor right now for the Demon Deacons travel travel on car Virginia Tech couple games ago they played valo game that they ended up winning handedly at home they had 10 first half turnovers Mike young started his postgame press conference by saying that was uh let me think about a word disgusting 10 first half turnovers in that game they have nine today typically take really good care of it another one double digits in the first half giving it away for the h Virginia Tech is really struggling offense and you get the idea get the sense theyre starting to try to force something quick pass back out Salis and it blocks long had the recovery oh that was a great job by long to get back there without fouling Reed had his back turned and thats his third foul Steve Forbes takes the risk put Reed back out there and three on the big man thats really a nice job by nickel to get the ball to the basket and to use his body kept his body between Reed and the basketball Reed I mean you got to understand how important youve been to your team thats one maybe you just let it go kind of a a splitsecond thing too right Dan because he had his back turned trying to get him position and then all of a sudden he has a guidance F and when youre in that kind of a situation again when youve got two fouls Sometimes the best thing is its not the worst the best decision to make is to just let the guy go its not the worst thing in the world if they score two points particularly when youre ahead by Double Nickel hits him Music both Reed also blocked by shots in this last game very good rim protector oh no hes a shot blocker and thats what shot blockers do they go after the ball L for Music car I didnt really see that develop the way he did but again cars got a few inches on long and used every inch to his Applause Advantage six points six rebounds for car threading for a double double in the ACC opener for Wake Forest good pass on the midrange bangs his way in to heavy with it and eras the rebound and long stepped out of bounds one of the interesting things Ive seen con is that W heres heres the pass we were talking about before he just flips that up and again the size Advantage is decisive there but what I find interesting here in this first half when the ball goes inside the kid his team are simply standing around watching him they need to go to get to open spots so he can pass them the ball Miller nice Tribble to get that Applause shot W Forest one of the most balanced teams in the country playing like it in their ACC opener was it love First Sight maybe Second Music Sight the final minute of his first half Virginia Tech has won four straight games one and0 in the ACC Wake Forest in their ACC opener great balance from their starting lineup as usual and they have just been absolutely sweltering defensively a 12th turnover for Virginia Tech that was a play that Virginia Tech usually runs very successful but really telegraphed that BCE pass and Miller with his quickness was able to get a hand on it and I think Millers quickness has been a big factor for w forest in this first half Miller short Salis keeps it alive second chance and the midrange down again hes really good in the mid range hes just playing with an awful lot of confidence you know I expected a lot of things today Conor I did not expect this two second Difference game in shot clock Miller right with kadulla little stop and start and it wont go one more chance to get one up and a foul oh on thats a oneone Applause Music Applause opportunity Welcome to the Music Applause so one and one with 6 seconds left for Carr and and this is been somewhat of a demolition in this first half it really has been the Wake Force defense has been dominant Steve Forbes talked to us about that this morning he said that theres no question that this team can score how well will we defend how well will we rebound plus five in rebounding in this first half a run for w Forest final gasp here before halftime for the hokes Padula and that is a summary of this first half from Winston Salem Wake Forest has not trailed their best first half of the Year scoring with 44 points and best first half of the Year defending allowing just 24 points looking for their seventh straight win and 1 and0 in ACC veka look for their biggest comeback of the season and car right to the rim and just like the first half it starts with wake out in front and again they take the ball inside the Carr Carr at 6 11 hes got 4 in and about 30 lbs in there what a great job he does maintaining his pivot footp and being able to go through that contact and score inside so three up on the board for Carr right away what do you think that Virginia Tech locker room was like I dont think it was a pleasant place to be I think we were better off being out here you started to wander back there a little bit no Ive been in some of those walk rooms Im not interested Music being the turnovers for the real alarming part Rex Steiners the first one out at point guard Virginia tacked after padulla spent a lot of time on the floor in the first half back from the foot injury and theres his teammate standing around as you watch the that particular play the ball goes inside to kid and his Hoke teammates just stand there and watch him they need to cut to force the defense to move to get some open opportunities worked out for kid to begin this half he saved out to Salis and it goes down boy Salis is showing you every single aspect of his game they can put out a little three LEL mixtape in this game H need to get Couture involved hes only taken two shots in this Collins lost it long the follow and there was a whistle its not no its not now course when youre playing against Virginia Tech one of the things you try to do is take H out of the game and basically its been Canon hildr for the most part whos done it that was you I didnt contest that was you hild just picked up his third foul but wake Force theyve got some pretty good defensive options you know if hildr gets in foul trouble then they can always have Salis match up against Couture thats two pretty good size and quickness match ups for the be that way off from maai long on his first well that was the thing that Steve Forbes even with the big lead for Wake for in the first half he with hildr he hung with Reed even when they got into foul trouble H stays out there with lead both with three fouls Tech a good free throw shooting team but long is not a good free throw shooter under 55 and after his misses long brings it front Court over their average and turnovers in the first half Virginia Tech had 12 giveaways again the way defensive movement has really bad no opening heres kid and a wild shot into the hands of Carr looking for a foul the ball went out of his hands but again the ball goes inside and his hooky teammates are just standing Reed fell down no call there five different guys that can hit you with a big night for w Forest Miller kicks it out seven on the clock Salis slips three again this is what were talking about where you can score a lot of baskets with very few assists because you got guys who are quick enough and strong enough to get to the goal Sal is called for that foul with the T drive thats a nice job by Virginia Tech to push it up the one of the reasons theyve been having a tough time is theyve been playing against the set defense Salis never did established position you know if a guy has a lane to the basket you cant just jump into that lane red B I think so and theyre not going to come over here and ask us anyway he said he do like being down here cuz you get to talk to the r quick fire nope and even that shot was Applause pressure we fou with the Miller on the Applause drive interesting for Virginia Tech sha padulla has been there starting point guard when healthy most of the year when do you think Mike young goes to him or is this is going to be re Steiner all the way well I dont know thats very interesting to see that may be one of the things this might be a point Mike young is trying to make kid picked up that foul boy Virginia Tech you dont want ly kid picking up fouls at the top of the key against the other teams point guard gave Sal some of that space we were talking about sagging off of him on the drive look at this discard Miller he walked and he took steps okay I thought that was pretty quick and so thats one of the reasons why Miller spins into the lane and then he just drags that pivot foot hes so quick he cant even control his PIV fastest guy in the pter Music baby H thought theyre pounding the ball again this has been Relentless they have been so aggressive defensively its been the true freshman point guard Rex Steiner out of the halftime break for Virginia Tech kid on Reed with the Applause hook double digits for Lyn kid is that the way back into this game just keep pounding it in there I think if you you know kid is if theyre not going to come and help against kid and I think he can operate oneonone particularly greed as the nice block Robbie Baron with the pin on Reed but I dont know that you can come all the way back in this game two at a time and theres Reed with his four I think at some point if Virginia Techs going to come back in the game theyve got to knock down some threes left and Reed less than four minutes into the half with the fourth foul so here comes Zach Keller again how long you sitting re well theres no reason to put it back in the game youre hit by 24 points you know if Virginia Tech makes a big run at you then you consider it but you dont really need read at this Applause point for does not play a lot of guys this contor with a tough Music one quickly back the other way Miller and a fou call I think they got bar and thats a situation where Miller speed you really cant prepare for that in practice until you you dont really understand it until you see it but Virginia Tech had four guys back and L just drove the ball up their backs with that Music quickness wake for is N9 to 10 at the line 10 of 11 at the line next Sunday on acc Network 14th ranked Virginia Tech in womens basketball a quadruple header they host number three NC State at new Eastern Georgia Tech pit number 22 Florida State in Clemson today capped off 6 Easter Boston College and Syracuse thats all in ACC Network next Sunday a long pass intercepted Salis cant hit him Applause quick Virginia check down by 20 at halftime the lead is grown and foul from behind with Baron in the post W forest in control and their ACC Music opener Hunter Salis trying to make it three times with what hes done making that big scoring leap and he was a kaga for two years well Virginia Tech eventually is going to have to make it at least one three but they need several of them they have not hit a three in this game yet dude they have not and this is a team they dont rely heavily on the three they get about 30 of their offense from out there which is average theyre right in the middle of the pack in terms of the NCA but if you dont make any threes that really affects your ability to put points on the board there have been five games this year Virginia Tech has made 10 threes and thatll count got that on the way down for a go t that ball started on the way down he he dunking yep Virginia Tech sticking with Rex Steiner at point guard out of the under 16 timeout yeah five different games this year Virginia Tech has made 10 plus threes and they have won all of those games this is a deep two for nickel and baron crashes in but it Applause away freericks the guy that can really get those feet set quickly Rex Steiner back on him on the sweep and the jump shot for Miller what a confident move by Miller he sees the Coller nickel guarding him and hes not intimidated at all he says okay I can use my quickness and get a jump Applause shot boy Miller up to 12 points and baron with the first three of the day for the hokes baron is a guy he made 34 threes last year at Northwestern shot 35 from out there has not shot that well for Virginia Tech Miller back in headed to the free throw line and this is another thing thats going to make a comeback very difficult Wake Forest was just willing to take the ball to the basket and its hard to keep Salis and Miller out of the lane Miller seems tireless too doesnt he well he certainly hadnt give any indication to slowing him down no hes scoring Ry Miller its translated at this level as padulla comes in for the first time for re Steiner in this half but Miller was was at Central Michigan 18 points a game there and really small sample played broken foot the first four games of last year for the chipa and thatll be an offensive foul that thats on padulla they just put padulla in the game and the first thing that happens is Miller uses that quickness again and gets right in his way and forces a Applause turnover off the fake hand off Baron and another block second really impressive play at the rim for Robbie Baron even with the block shot R forc able to get back on defense nice move hes starting to feel good on offense too now you make a three and that means the guy cheats out a little bit on you you can drive past him speaking of driving past good help open three and the follow for Salis well thats another area where Virginia Tech has struggle eight offensive rebound through away Music coresta and it rolls down thats a situation where padulla did the right thing by staying in position because his man went to help and he was wide open for kid to find so couple threes in short time after the 0 for seven start for Virginia in and out Frederickson big drown from the crowd but now your wake for you dont want to get in the habit of just settling for that threee you had great success driving the ball to the basket and you got to keep that up hasnt happen a lot today where Virginia tack is going score stop and then another score and it wont happen here offensive foul going to get pushing off excuse me Couture tour is not happy about it on the left side of your screen I dont what that Music was its like Couture and kid tag team him knocked sales down its setting up for a a tabletop or something like that 15 Virginia Tech turnovers in this game par and back to the free throw line for car thats a thats a really good one two punch on the inside for Wake Forest Reed is out of the game but now you can get Carr whos 6 11 can get down in there and score with his back to the basket hes pretty vers he shoot the three so Reed is a guy who can get you back to the basket goal and so is car Carr had to do a little bit more of that back with Fon Reed not eligible in the beginning of the season this is what hes done since Reed has been in the starting lineup the last two games double doubles and he knocks down two here hes got 13 points Applause today C checked out got marches Maran back in got the play jumping with the foot back done from the first out good tough catch Alis came over to help got back to the oneonone that was a really tough catch by Kid because that was not a great pass and so now if youre Virginia Tech you got to get some stops you mentioned before you just havent had a situation where theyve scored and gotten a stop then they got their stop they need more of them long ontake got hit and headed to the free throw line away clock stops get back to back scores if long can connect Maran has got good quick feet but that time he went for the threepoint fake by long and long hadnt made a three all year so you dont go for that out Steve corbes pointed out Marcus Mary in a shoot around today and said see him right there hes a class of Tony Bennett type guy hes a guy that Virginia would recruit we feel like we found a kind of a diamond in the rough type guy came from Denmark well and you read like interesting things but uh he was the top r player in Denmark how often can somebody say that yeah hes also lgic grass hes a soccer player had to give that up cuz hes allergic to grassp well that will put a damper on your playing soccer Salis quick attack and a BB 177 electrifying points for Hunter Salis Wake Forest is rolling back to Dan boner Conor onion who you got in the semis in the semis yeah I have no idea Michigan and Washington how about that okay any reason or youre just reading two teams that on the screen I there were two teams on the screen I had two chances didnt pick two teams play in the same game yeah there you go okay wait for is that big and what would be a seventh consecutive win first time since 2009 they can do that stay with Couture and Virginia Tech down this way again Salis moves his feet so well thats a play you see Couture Mak an awful lot but sal sal just a little too quick Ks been the top score for Virginia Tech P the midrange and got that pure is a guy who can make some tough shots and I think that hes got to be a little bit more aggressive of course its hard to be aggressive when youre getting the kind of defensive pressure hes received all night nine really really hardearned points for Hunter toour this hild with the strong drive again he he just Bulls his way the back really does niichel doing his best HRI hes fou H just I mean he gets in there almost you can say that he pushed his way to the basket he really did clear out the space in there but thats the way he plays he plays so hard and so aggressively all the time Applause he was called the leader of this team by Boy Miller guy that knows exactly what the coaching staff wants talking about cam HRI know theres a a moment in a game against Virginia his freshman years the coaches were preaching do not dribble into the corner H dribbled into the corner but he sat for the next six games and thats helped form his leadership now that hes one of the older guys giving him an experience to say hey the coaches really mean what they Music say bringing in transfers like Salis and Reed getting them into this lineup right away then kid with the left 14 points l k BR give him some room down inside he is really tough and in this situation you know a lot of times you would try to double team him to prevent him from doing that but youre I think Virginia Tech needs threepoint baskets theyre not going to come back two at a time so youre content with just trying to defend kid oneonone good W course a lot of Second Chances and that is too many chances that is now 18 Second Chance points in this game for w for it seems like Salis has scored just about every chance that hes gotten on the second CH 20 points for him and they get the stop on kid theyre also shutting out Virginia Tech in Second Chance Point could have been one and done all day a lot of Virginia Tech shots have been just exactly what weve seen theres four guys standing out on the perimeter the kid misses the shot theres no way you can get an offensive movement theres been very little penetration with the dribble by Virginia thats another way you create openings for offensive mov Pon short there been very transition opportunities for Virginia back the Wake all day kid off of Bounce rolls out hell dri wrestles it away forest with this balance in their starting lineup Four Guys averaging 152 points a game or more the only team in the country that can say that so so many different ways to come at you HRI throws another we said Hill can shoot the three you know mainly hes bulling his way to the basket but he is a pretty good threepoint shooter as well theres four guys into double digits with scoring for w corus in this game big four in their starting lineup turn big five as pure with the scoop scores for the Applause Applause h sales has been the top guy in this game get to the rim a bunch with 20 points this is eldrid working in on niichel popping in rebound nichel hes got a good shot looks like theres a little caught in between there trying to get the ball to kid and kid took that to it everything coming up Demon Deacons today Hunter Salis with 20 points by the way Andrew Carr is coming back into the game when we come back two points away from 1000 in his career it aint my dads and hes just been productive each and every year hes gotten better even with the jump and level eight points a game 10 points a game last year at 11 and this year at 15 next field goal for him well get him there Andrew Carr po discard on Reed and the recovery for car how about that you know theyve been playing oneonone inside but Reed falls down and what a great recovery by Carr to block down we see if they were reward Carr with the thous after his big block Reed working in on Music potit show of a little help Couture came over Reed airball no reset Miller in and out but again another offensive rebound and they didnt convert it that time nichel cash it in thats an open three transition havent had very many of those today you know Wake Forest has as many offensive rebounds as they do turnover Miller loses it thats T off yeah thats a a staggering number guys the tour stays down re Steiner stays down looks like he caught one in the in the mouth Applause Miller just going up for the shot and catches him on the chin give us that number talking about again they have six offensive rebounds and six drills a three the guy with some deep range there theres a long road back and its probably too long a road but youre not come back without forcing some turnovers now you got to force some turnovers and make some threes Carr 4 1000 not here you really have to push away test out into the Open Floor Salis surang and Virginia Tech does recover Carr wants it he wants a th000 hes going to have to go to the free throw line to get it you cant give him a th000 out of gold 10 can you well you could but they did not decide it was a goal P car gets Contour to the basket and its not a Goen just because he hit the back board oh that was that was agonizing you was I it was how could that come out 999 for Andrew Applause Park is this the big 1000 Andrew Carr 1000 points in his Applause career exactly as many points there one of the great ones here Jeff te finished his career with 1000 points there a demon Applause Deacon the fres to quadruple digits car that was kicked before they can get the ball down and the shot clock will stay at 23 1000 points you think about some of the greats that are played in this program Randol children Tim Duncan theyre in the 2000 Point play well theyre some of the greats of all time yep Music Miller a lot of people if youre doing trivia on on Wake for probably say oh five in that company two years finish just sort of it now he may not have a th000 points but hes one of the great for players thats for sure sure is three is then off to the NBA finished with 948 in two years CP3 Dallas gave it up rebound for Applause kill and thats out of bound I want you to think on this Dan boner youve seen a lot of ball the most memorable 1000th Point bucket that youve seen in your career oh good Heavens hurry up were going to miss first chair this one next fad man not the actual person holding it to scored his 1000 points I need to get him a new Fathead because hes got the beard yeah thats a good point so got to get a fat head with facial hair maybe maybe an AI fat head Andrew Carr 1000 points congratulations to him you got to answer the question I posed to you going to break the most I I dont remember the basket itself but I remember that I was in the building when my former teammate in Virginia alltime great Barry Parker SC His Thousand you dont remember the basket I do not but I remember Barry he was a great teammate great friend remember the ball did they give him anything like that or well they gave Barry about anything that Barry needed to have he was uh theres always in a program that grows so a program that comes from nowhere and does something you always have a start and at the University of Virginia Barry Park Hill was the start and he may not be the best player in the VG in the history of Virginia basketball but he may have been one of the most important Wonder as far as the Legacy for car hes been here a couple years after Delaware this is a Wake Forest team that has its eyes on its first NCAA tournament since 2017 to maybe not part of the start but maybe part of the restart for Wake for we heard St in the studio say that he thinks this is definitely a wait for his team thats going to the tournament what do you think well I think were were still in December and theres a lot of basketball left to be played but certainly this is a wake Force team that put themselves in position with a you know they didnt lose any games that they shouldnt have lost in a noncon for schedule have some good wi this is a good win nice basket by Nel but this is a good win Virginia Tech will play much better win a lot of games but this white course looks like an NCA tournament team to me but again tournament is a couple months away that was Nifty that was very Nifty but this has been the the kind of a day its been for Virginia Tech they have had to make some tough shots and N tougher than that one right there it goes back to what we talked about before for Wake Forest how they defend will determine the answer to the conversation we just had theyre going to score 80 points a game in nonconference they have five starters that can go get your d double figure sometimes all five in one night like tonight heres s uh Reed going inside with the left Applause Bo not much resistance there from Virginia Tech and Wake Forest is not going to score 8 points every night so their defense is going to have to get through some tough stretches but they have so many different guys can score but its its hard to believe that theyre going to have an offensive night where they only get like 40 or 50 I know this is going to be chocked up as a loss for Virginia Tech but that is a really good sign Robbie Baron hit two threes in this game mentioned how it do was struggle out of the gate for him two more today he is four of eight in his last couple games coming in I think its an important part of the Virginia Tech offense the way Mike Youngs team like to play offense if they can have a four guy who can shoot the three that makes them much more versatile and Baron and long just havent been that yet gotten good defense good rebounding from those guys flat footed h a three just everything everything is going for a Wake Forest this afternoon so they might not score 80 every game handle it today they have in this game Applause hey coming up next well take you to Kansas City Hunter Dickinson number two Kansas hting witas State close out 2023 thats coming up right here on ESPN 2 right after Applause this and right after this iss coming closer and closer Andrew Carr on the day that he celebrates scoring 1000 points a hug with Cam hilber likely off the floor for the last time love the awareness of the fans here too there was a sign that went up right away they knew he needed exactly 15 points to get there will Underwood one of the guys that comes in zanka also Applause in and you said it everything is going to the Demon Applause Deacons Applause Music Applause so for a Wake Forest team that does not go very deep onto their bench getting some of the guys deeper down the bench look Maran kick out another one not Applause here re Steiner off and the shot clock D and absolutely no doubt about it for Wake Forest in their AC opener for the first time since 2009 the demon Deans have won seven consecutive games and theres no doubt about this wake for
