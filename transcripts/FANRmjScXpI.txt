uh a lot of new faces but an exciting time for the sparts Ben Middlebrooks jumping it up with Mr Dean and we are underway in the 2024 25 season here at the newly renamed Lenovo Center in Raleigh this is Jaden Taylor new number fight for the rebound an offensive rebound and a stick back by dant Tre as Styles the transfer from Georgetown strong move by Don t one thing about this NC State team is they love to crash the glass on shots you get a look at the starters for the Spartans expect to play about 10 new players tonight there are 13 newcomers on this roster a deflection but theyre able to stick with it Chico Johnson kamman Gregory three to shoot and a push underneath and Middlebrooks who gets the start tonight at the five the senior from Fort launderdale Florida going to be whistled for the foul Ben brings a great level of leadership to this team him and Michael cono and J Jaden Taylor three contributors to the final four run theyre essential pieces to this NC State team fresh 20 on the shot clock another deflection for the wolf back and this time a turnover picked off by Marcus Hill and the transfer turns it right back over pass intercepted by the freshman and the alln Nam team Mr Dean big SWAT by Applause Middlebrooks and the first basket for the Spartans goes to Daniel helter Hoff hes playing the five tonight an injury to brillan Garcia hell be unavailable to go for the Spartans the match up between Daniel and middle Brooks is going to be a very physical match up down low Taylor probing creates for Middlebrooks misses the bunny theyll reset to your butler transfer Jaden Taylor whos coming off the bench for the majority of that historic run last year styles with a flush Casey were seeing early Inc state looks to be really strong in the front Court this year yes Ben Middlebrooks adds a great level of toughness down low Jaden Taylor does need to be aggressive though hes a score that theyre going to play through a lot this season so we see the Spartans double the post Middlebrooks Mak them pay for it both of these teams its a short preseason yeah Casey when youre trying to play with so many new new players it goes by fast in the summertime this is Mr Dean to turnaround and he banks it in over top of styles outstretched hand those are shots that NC State wants you to shoot theyre very physical and one thing that NC State needs to do better is guard the drives thats something they struggled in a lot in the exhibition Marcus Hill gets to his spot and scores thats what he did in junior college in two years thats what he did at Bowling Green last year when he led the Mac in scoring Applause itll be another Spartan turnover Ben Middlebrooks once again add a certain level of toughness down low hes a high level shot blocker and he puts pressure on the opposing offensive team NC State with an early lead play in front of a great crowd tonight it was a hot ticket everybody in town wanted to be here for the unveiling of the banners Styles can hit that three doesnt this time another recycle on the boards its Middlebrooks little pick and roll and oconnell is fouled Mike ococ does a great job reading ball screens thats something that he does when he comes off hes always looking to pass its something hes looking to always set guys up and that that Defender drop back he did a great job of pulling up drawing the foul so itll be a couple of free throws for the fifth year player three years at Stanford where he graduated and just three his second year at NC State decided to come back both teams going to make some subs here itll be three new players for the Spartans theyre going to get Isaiah skanner in along with Nick book The 68 Ford Middlebrooks comes out and Brandon Huntley Hatfields transfer from Louisville will come in and play the five andc state is going to pick up full court a lot in this game one thing I would say is that NC State fits what Kevin Keat is looking for this NC State team the likes of having Brandon Huntley Hatfield a very quick fan who could play full court and goal multiple positions Gregory tried to turn the corner on Hill a back door cut and a flush by Mr Dean I did have to ask I said hey is that the name on his birth certificate they said yes what an awesome name Mr Dean flies high for the flush first touch for Brandon Huntley Hatfield crosscourt Skip its Hill NC State is going to have to hit shots as we can see theyre starting to double brand in hutley half field and thats going to lead to a lot of open shots for NC State drive into the paint by Brit Harris hell get it back top of the key with 17 to shoot oconnell got a deflection tough shot over Huntley Hatfield and the stick back is there Isaiah skanner the red shirt junr from Mount San jento College USC Upstate has a lot of transfers who were key contributors at their previous school and this game is a key opportunity for them to Showcase their skills against High Lev competition got a whistle away from the ball underneath I think its going to go against book pushing on Huntley Hatfield thatll take us to our first media timeout its the Spartans with a onepoint lead always just wait till he says clear that way we know something dreed my whole I EXP last Music welcome you back to the Lenovo Center home of the NC State weol back look at a season ago 9 and 11 in the ACC finished 10th Andrew Sanders here with champ Casey morcel Casey look its no secret last yearas the regular season didnt go the way you had envisioned it y lost four straight going into uh the ACC tournament back in DC your hometown what clicked for you guys what changed well one thing it it takes time to figure out the recipe that works right and later on or I guess at the right time we found a recipe a plan more in a half court one thing we never succeeded in was the four court pressure and when we decided to go back and guard as what we call the NBA three line it worked for us and we were able to be a highle Defenders which made teams struggle on the offensive end five wins in five days and then a trip to the Final Four on top of it oh a tough take and a finish by Chico Johnson red shirt freshman from Toledo spent last year with Coach RoR at Drake but red shirt it did not play so thats his first Collegiate bucket maybe a kick ball no just a turnover this USC Upstate team is looking to drive and Coach RoR told us look if were playing well again they have so many new pieces they almost dont know what to expect he said so one thing I can tell you were our guys are going to compete and we want to play Fast theyre going to see if they can play Fast very similar to NC State very similar they love to run a transition and they love the drive big box out by freshman Bryce herd who grabs the rebound making his Collegiate debut the fourstar recruit was going to be a class of 2025 guy he reclassified signed with NC State in Late July now here he is playing college basketball in no November interesting move by Kevin Keats running four guard lineup against his UFC Upstate team and a foul from behind Isaiah Skinner fouling Bryce hers already The Freshman who by the way is one of the youngest players talk about reclassification one of the youngest players in the country in fact hes believed to be the fourth youngest player in the nation and already cleaning up the glass and hell go to the line looking for his first Collegiate points the third team foul on the Spartans herd is 65 freshman from Chicago Casey earlier you said you feel like this team and every team is different you feel like this team really fits what coach Keats is trying to do yep y I mean in terms of speed athleticism exactly Kevin Keys loves to get up and down running transition and last years team didnt fit necessarily the makeup to be the fastest in the country thats something that Kevin Kei says a lot in practice shooot around he wants to be the fastest team in the country and with at the within the addition of Brandon Huntley Hatfield he could fit that mold and build on what he wants to do couple of made free throws good by herd his first Collegiate points Trey Parker into the game The Freshman NC State showing some pressure Spartans little out of sours but they get an open Corner three and another good box out by herd Music whistle away from the ball Huntley Hatfield tied up and hes going to be called for the offensive foul as he got tied up with helter Hoff Holly Hatfield has to be cautious with his foul he has to be cautious hes very physical but NC State needs big so something that theyre locking in is the front Court get a look off the ball look hes trying to get position out of bounds last Touch by NC State look like coach Kei is going to get Styles back in the game hell replace herd who gave him a couple good minutes oh you were a fiveyear player its its been a little while like youre still a young guy right but its been a little while since you made your Collegiate debut Im old in college Years College Years but theres certainly got to be a few nerves when youre so many players on both teams making their debut tonight for their team and some of of them in college basketball in general yes this open and night game and especially with whats at stake right the the banner raising its always going to be nervous in this open tonight pass the alley up to Applause Styles and Parker with a kickball in the backourt Casey will get another look at this dunk dant trees Styles hes adding a great spark to this team hes a guy who could play multiple positions and the fact that he could play the four and stretch it on the offensive end today hes been putting a lot of pressure on the rim he could also shoot it from three which adds a great spark to this NC State team styles with a game high six points already and we get just a little Glimpse at what youre talking about how fast NC State wants to play as I said earlier their goal is to be one of the fastest in the country knocked out of bounds by the wolf pack and also is always a goal for Coach Keats he wants what 40 deflections per game yes there is a guy on the sideline that is currently keeping track of that I Im curious to see where they are right now but that is the goal for your deflections and usually when they get over 40 usually they tend to win they have a much better record when they reach the 40 Music mark Gregory able to get to the middle of the floor able to get to the cup and scoop it home once again USC Upstate is looking to drive they havent shot it great but looking to drive and thats something that NC State needs to guard if they want to win this game Gregory who comes from Junior College Florida Southwestern where seven years ago thats where coach RoR was the head coach got a foul here set in the screen is that on Taylor it is his first teams fourth very accidental right there theres a lot of movement with this Kevin kes offense and Jaden Taylor just ran the wrong Music direction Carmelo Atkins in the game number four for the Spartans now Gregory using his quickness I think Huntley Hatfield bother that shot but the Spartans are playing hard and theyre getting to the offensive glass theres a defensive rebound by Jaden Taylor hell be one of the leaders on the team this year playing in his final year at college basketball Hill driving dish Corner three Styles what a start by donrees Styles hes a huge spark to this NC State team hes looking like the goto guy for this NC State Styles playing the four at 66 couple of years down the road at North Carolina before a year at Georgetown here he guards Dean and Fs so that foul will take us to our break NC State with a 162 League Styles already has nine Music Music you e e e Music be Music Applause dant Tre styles with nine early points but he just picked up his second foul as well so hell head to the bench an impressive debut for him well see if we see him in the next 1139 the rest of this first half but having a stretch four can do a lot for you offensively weve already seen that from Styles hes been a huge spark for this NC State team scoring nine of six of the 16 points someone else is going to have to step up if they want to be in a good position heading into halftime first free throw good by Mr Dean and just a freshman from Miami hes been really assertive here early when at Styles drew that second foul he gets both free throws as well and Dean leading the way scoring wise for the Spartans with six points Dennis Parker Jr into the game for NC State out of the timeout good to see him as he missed the exhibition against Lee McCrae with an injury but back healthy ready to go against little Zone here Taylor trying to shoot him out of it itll stay on this end now Den Parker Jr missed the the the key stretch of that postseason with an illness but he was the Lone freshman last year and still had a big impact he was he was he added a great spark to us at times in a regular season hes a stretch forward who could shoot it hes adds a certain level of Versatility similar to dant styles with the way he plays its good to see him out here tonight Middlebrooks lost the handle turns it over run out Spartans Gregory cant hit the layup and now okell on the push Hill splits two and scores great play by Mike OC pushing it with his eyes up hes always looking to find the next man he ends up finding Marcus Hill in transition second basket for Hill hes got four and a steal by Parker Jr again the wolf pack with numbers okell in Applause Rhythm timeout Applause Spartans its defense to offense in the pack making the Spartans play hey they fit four their last five Music he Music Music USC Upstate calling timeout is NC States been able to turn defense to offense a couple of times here KC NC State is is pressuring USC Upstate theyre forcing him to play fast and make quick decisions they want you to shoot it early to propel NC State to go on a run on in transition as you can see here NC State is bringing the pressure and its starting to turn it up as theyre starting to score on offensive end nearly a steal by oconnell in the back court 15 to shoot for book The Freshman from New Zealand another deflection think looking to draw a foul there is Chico Johnson didnt get the whistle oconnell left open again State starting to get hot once again forcing turnovers leads the easy baskets for NC State in the transition Mike oconnell ended up shooting almost 38 from three a year ago but he turned that up really during that run his shooting improved uh his playmaking improved yeah Mike okono when he was hitting shots on that run last year it provided a different spark cuz now teams like playing with DJ Burns and muhamed diara they drew so much attention and the fact that he was starting to shoot at a high clip it provided a different Spark and Propel at NC State to go on a major run Jaden Taylor called for the foul hell go out and the NC State debut Collegiate debut for Paul mcneel Jr The Freshman from Rockingham North Carolina their highest rated freshman out of high school they say he is an absolute bucket getter as you said NC stays very excited about him happy to see him out here tonight I dont want to draw any unfair comparisons but the last freshman they said that about his name was Travon Smith SP Smith had 20 open tonight you know that I did not but Im not surprised let me tell you Hill tipped in by Huntley Applause Hatfield its a 10 nothing Wolfpack run Kanye Jones left the three short you see NC State wants to play at lightning Pace OK Connell nearly turns it over McNeil well you can hear the building get a little excited for his first touch Gregory a deep three that wont go can I only imagine how fun it is playing in your home state you get the opportunity to have all your family come and watch your Music games great shot by Paul McNeil right there as see the bio on mcneel thats not a typo by the way 71 points in a single game that was a 74y old record in North Carolina High School basketball that he broke thats big time you dont see that every day stepped on the sideline turned it over to Drew McConnell 71 points some people I mean thats a seasons worth of scoring right get that in a high school game exactly thats what 8 Minute quarters yeah yeah without a shot clock Trey Parker handling the backup point guard duties Spartans throwing a little different look here in the zone Parker to mcneel oh Brion pass skies for the rebound the rare fourthe player at the same school hes a senior for NC State Parker buries the triple hes one of the most followed not just freshman but players in the country has combined over a million followers on Tik Tok and Instagram mostly because of his dunking ability but they say hes a lot more than just a dunker we might see one from Huntley HFI NC stay is is getting hot and its all starting on the defensive end theyre pressuring them and forcing us USC Upstate to play Fast thatll put an end to the runner theyre going to get Kanye Jones the an one will take a timeout the wolf pack off and running here in the season opener w wel Applause Music Music Music make a three we said hey look hes a lot more than just an exciting dunker but this was at Prime Time With The Pack jumped over a couple teammates and Mr Wolf yeah you just dont see that every day I mean his type of athleticism is on a different level you should see some of the dunks that he practices theyre insane Parker was going to come to NC State a year ago decided to spend an extra year with overtime Elite and they are happy to have him right now you know could he play a backup point guard role at times right now hes out there on the floor with oconnell by the way they did give Kanye Jones uh the basket free throw good as well for the N1 its a 14point lead for NC State that snapped a 15 nothing run as helter Hoff is going to be called for a foul hes got his hands full to tonight with Huntley Hatfield that guy is built I mean he he just adds a certain level of physicality to this in State team and that was something that he was really did at Louisville I mean he was just so tough and that was what made them so tough to score on in the paint honorable mention all ACC last year at Louisville he also finished top five in the acccs most improved player voting catch and shoot for Parker tough shot falling away and he missed short oh B book picked up his dribble maybe where he shouldnt have got away with it Jones got stuffed on the rim but they say he was fouled on his way once again as you see there on the shot fake USC is looking to drive theyre looking to get in the paint they havent shot it great so they figure thats how theyre going to score at a high level is by getting in the paint Jones who spent one year in the ACC at Boston College he spent his last couple of years at Buffalo he averaged eight points a game last season just nine Applause appearances this Upstate team theyre going to play hard met with Marty RoR earlier and some of the key principles that he said is that theyre going to compete play hard and play unselfish were seeing that here tonight pass a tough take and he scores Applause it strong move by Brion pass finishing with the left hand its a high Lev move in this era of college basketball teams all across the country are going to have you know chemistry new chemistry a lot of new faces but I dont know if if anybody can compete with you know the 13 newcomers and returning just 9 minutes so uh this is truly a debut not just you know for a few players but basically the entire team and of course the new era under coach RoR they played well at times when theyve taken care of the basketball in this first half yeah especially on the offensive end theyre mixing it up on defense adding a little Zone a little offense switching out the ball screen coverage NC State is handling it very well Huntley Hatfield called for a push away from the ball so theres a look at the roster breakdown but you know what coach RoR remember his first head coaching job uh a few years ago in junior college thats what hes used to you know you have players for a year or two so the turnover that has you know become the norm in college basketball he feels comfortable with that and he feels like like he can build a winner his recruiting pitch he told us was be the first they have never made the NCAA tournament the pitch to the guys who says hey you can be a part of the first team to do it thats a great opportunity to go and make your mark on this in on at USC Upstate as you can see with NC State having the opportunity to make history and raise a banner youre going to be me remembered forever and at USC Upstate their nonconference is at a high level they got a lot of great matchups and Marty RoR he he put guys in a great position hes coached at every level except ni and you hes experienced hes com comfortable coaching in these type of atmospheres OK Connell turns it over an unforced error there and thats the sixth turnover for NC State in this first half its been a little sloppy that was kind of one of the calling cards for not just your team last year Casey but your three years at NC State you guys took care of the ball at a high level thats a major key is taking care of the ball I mean when you take care of the ball thats more opportunities that you have to score and less opportunities for teams to get easy Basket in transition its going to be called an offensive foul on Brit Harris nine team fouls on NC State so double bonus the rest of the away for the Spartans thats just the fifth team foul on USC Upstate NC State with a good bit of of foul trouble with Huntley Hatfield Styles and Taylor all with two Hill turns it over again that one was stripped by Chico Johnson Harris off the window for two SC state has to do a better job with ball security USC Upstate wants the pressure theyre going to play hard if you dont get a shot at least the easy opportunities for USC update a basketball a game of runs its a 1 run for NC State its a 60 run right now for the Spartans The Freshman herd drives the Baseline and he was fouled on his way to the rim itll be on the floor coach keeps playing with quite a few lineups and again uh you know middle Brooks gets the start he could certainly start at the five youd expect Huntley Hatfield to probably start quite a bit at the five also this year however they want to do that but right now you have essentially three starters on the bench with two fouls so an opportunity for some of the the other guys out here to show that I know its it might be too early in the season Casey to talk about rotations but as a player you got to be hungry for those minutes and this is an audition to get more bets thats one thing about Kevin Keats on open tonight he will give everyone an opportunity to at least show what they can do um one thing about practice is not like the game playing here in PNC with these fans it is theres nothing like it so here here is a great opportunity for guys to have a great for guys to have opportunity to play later on in the season defense by middle Brooks and herd is smothering Dean as it tipped out of bounds his pass into the NC State bench where those three guys are there with the two fouls also Mike James who is a transfer from Louisville and expected to be a starter on this team he is not playing tonight out with a an injury at his knee scope they say hes out two to four weeks hes going to be a great addition when he returns right his versatility he could shoot it guard multiple positions and thats something and a shot clock violation as Middlebrooks protects the rim NC State fans love a good shot clock violation you can hear it in atmosphere tonight you know we went to practice and there is some Buzz about Middlebrooks maybe being the most improved player uh theyre very excited about him in his senior season what does he bring to this this program he just adds a certain level of physicality down low one thing he does need to improve on is finishing but he is starting to finish at a high level that we saw in practice and its good to see that theyre playing through him a lot more he can do that too thats a great addition to add to your game Middlebrook steps out and knocks down the three thats something he did just once last year and theres the physicality youre talking about Applause casy just one three a year ago but he can step out and shoot it as can Huntley Hatfield these two fives can stretch the floor pass finds him and its five quick points for Middlebrooks here on backtoback possessions Ben adds a great spark oh we saw it on the final four run Applause but he gets going theyre very hard to beat the lead back up to 14 and herd fouls Gregory Way outside the ark thatll take us to our under four timeout fastpaced action here in the season opener between the pack and the Spartans Music rebound Morel to oconnell oconnell with one second left wing Music three fans turn your attention now to the ref ERS as we unveil the ACC Championship Banner join in the countdown 3 2 Music 1 following the ACC tournament Championship the wolfback captured the heart of the nation as coach Keats and his Squad battle through the first and second rounds to advance to the Sweet 16 in Dallas where they knocked off Marquette and Duke to advance to the programs first final four since 1983 now join us in unveiling a banner to commemorate that trip to the final four in Phoenix count it down three 2 1 e they have gone back and ruled the Middlebrooks 382 so thats why your score is one less than when you left for commercial break back with Casey morcel Im Andrew Sanders all right Casey five games in five days how you did it and kept the legs you know fresh enough to win the title you know well never know but uh this run with with those five you know theres six teams in the ACC that have won the national title you beat obviously NC state in 74 and 83 you beat the other five during that run yeah I mean the its essential to treat each game as its own Championship right like you dont when you go into it youre not thinking about going into the championship game you got to get past the very first round first and that was the approach right I mean heading into it I remember we were going on our bus to DC and before we went on a trip Kevin Keats came in our meeting and he wrote Z and zero on the board and from that point on that put us in a mindset that okay were just like every team in the country every team is z zero and we were able to treat each game like its own Super Bowl and we were able to have a run that we will never forget and the the energy the emotion the The Vibes whatever momentum whatever you want to call it his pass knocks down the three it just keeps building at what point do you guys realize like hey we might we got something special going on here you you realize it um well okay Michael connells shot was a big time shot for us um but when we you know we had just seen so much right throughout the Run we we had faced a total of 11 elimination games locking foul oconnell was out of the restricted area our officials Tonight Eric Lewis Adam FL and Grant toon two free throws coming here for Jones all right but obviously yeah that that shots a pretty memorable one that is a pretty memorable youre right by the way I was watching the highlight of that getting ready for this game just refreshing myself it was you that pulled in the rebounds off of the Miss free throw and threw it ahead to oconnell I was surprised because there was a 90 free throw shooter at the line and he had missed it OC I had to kick ahead but that was a special moment because we were down six with 45 seconds in that game um and the fact that we pulled that out um that showed nothing but it was destiny free throw lips out middle Brooks grabs it with two hands just over two and A2 minutes to play a 14o lead here in the first half for NC State by the way coming up at halftime if you missed the open of the show and the banner unveiling here at the Lenovo Center were going to play that for you again at halftime so certainly make sure you stick around Parker Jr tough move and finish strong move by Dennis Parker did a great job putting a combo together to get to the paint and finish over to some other Defenders Applause Middlebrooks whistled and two more shots coming a lot of downhill stuff for the Spartans here but if you look you are already a very popular guy around Raleigh but after the five wins in five days after the run to the final four your life changed I mean to say youre a celebrity right now and everybody coming up to you at the game that would be an understatement it definitely feels good being home watching the banners hang down its a great feeling to come back and do this in a great City of Raleigh theres nothing like Applause it or free throws for the Spartans where theyve been really good tonight 12 of 13 from the strike good deflection Mr Dean got his hands on it Jones lost it stolen away by o Applause Connell Mike O Connell to the rim Miche o Connell has been very aggressive tonight hes doing it all shooting it well getting in the paint adding a great spark to this NC State team as we expected what does it bring to a team when you got a a veteran like that a fif point guard its easy for him to rally the troops together right hes one of the most experienced and as we see with this lineup theres four returners from that final four team and theyre all the chemistry is unmatched theyre all on the same page even with the rotation especially on the offensive end eight points now for Carman Gregory yeah hes been dangerous off the dribble tonight 70 seconds left that pick and roll action Middlebrooks with the layup OK connells gotten nine points but he just added his fourth assist as well Ben Middlebrooks is doing it all his experience playing at Clemson too also gave him a great Advantage coming here to State Parker junr with with the block and he saves it to pass theyll shoot three again missed the exhibition with with a a light injury he looks healthy and hes still got the Hops and this could be a big year for Brion pass Casey we were talking during practice you senior year now you were telling me we dont we havent seen him in his NC State Career has never started but hes a knockdown shooter from distance this year is the year he could potentially start at some point NC State is going to need a lot from Brion pass and his scoring his his playmaking and his leadership you know one thing that Brion pass is starting to do a lot more this year is is his is being vocal leading the guys telling guys where to go and the fact that hes out here being aggressive getting to his spots um its something that NC State definitely needs theyre reviewing here is this a two or a three from that angle I think pretty clear its a three Brion had four points against Purdue in the final four thats a very short list of people that have scored in a final four yeah for sure and gives him some confidence coming into this his senior season so it should be we determined should be three free throws Music Casey has this been kind of what youve expected so far from this game both teams pushing Tempo yes sir yeah definitely as expected um you know I think one of the surprising things is how many guys Kei is playing I know one thing he is still trying to figure it out but uh its good to see guys like Brion pass you know Dennis Parker different guys who you know didnt have much of an opportunity last year coming out stepping up and helping this team uh putting this team in a great position heading in halftime Applause Applause Spartans got to go quick here and they do break the timeline with two to go Parker Jr another Applause block and okell wants to use a timeout with 20 seconds remaining talking about you know coach GS playing a lot of different guys eight newcomers potentially seven making their debut heve seen six so far and Dennis Parker Jr not a newcomer but again missed him during the postseason didnt see him in the exhibition but just giving you a taste to what he can bring to his sophomore year and even though depth of this team right now Casey standing out and even though he didnt play much in the postseason he was still a guy who started a good amount of games for us so theres nothing new to him being out here playing in this Arena and like you said with so many new guys coming in NC State looks like theyre starting to figure it out on what works well for them and theyre going to have to building it heading in heading into the second half all three freshmen have appeared so far again we wont see Mike James tonight wont see him for at least a couple of weeks could be two to four we have not seen isil gof yet the transfer from Canada the Junior from Quebec but 50 points in the first half Inc State using a timeout here talk about this last possession I do think theyre looking to go to dant Tre Styles um dant Tre Styles is onear of their leading scores and when he was out there he had a a heat check moment where he was getting hot early due to foul trouble he was dismissed from the game so back out there for offense with the two fouls its pass both Parker Trey and Dennis oconnell and styles they spread it out for pass Gregory good if it goes and he got it at the horn they say count the basket Im sure itll be reviewed but as it stands a three at the buzzer to cut it to 15 as we head into halftime it was an exciting first half it was an exciting pregame as Im sure the reviews cant tell from that got Casey you think he got it off in time fortunately that looks good that looks good and look like he got it off in plenty of time so theyre going to review well go to the halftime break again stick with us well show you the banner unveiling the ACC Championship and the final four Banner thats coming up next here on the ACC Network extra Music SK SE e e e heres the first free throw on the way and Rams

Connell dant Tre Styles um Brion pass these are all guys who are scoring at a high clip off of these turnovers each of those guys are combining for nine points and six assists total and its been a

minutes in well be back with second half action after this e exactly the way that they want to see if any adjustments are made here to start the second half underneath they get a layup from Mr Dean hes just full of energy hes always active always where wherever the ball is Mr Dean has made his presence known tonight 13 minutes in the first half he now has eight points Hunley Hatfield comes and sets a ball screen for Hill he gets downhill and scores and theyre going to pause the action here to get the perspiration off the floor as Huntley hatfeld hit the deck right before uh he set that pick on the ball but its an encouraging sign from Marcus Hill Jr the senior from Rockford Illinois again led the mack in scoring last year hes a big transfer pickup NC State you know you think back a couple years ago you played with tur quavon Smith uh he could get a bucket late in the shot clock DJ horn last year was able to do that this team theyre still going to have to find you know who can be that goto score in late clock situations yep and thatll take time thatll take time one good thing about Marcus Hill is that hes letting the game kind of come to him yes he average 20 last year at his previous school but hes not out here trying to force and get that 20 piece you know hes letting it come natural and thats something thats very valuable to this NC State team in the first half 12 on the shot clock the Spartans have to inbound it all about 90 ft away from the bucket Gregory seems to be that guy for the Spartans thats going to have the ball in his hands blows the layup hes going to have the ball in his hands looking to create late in a late game late clock situations Hill spin move Music Applause scores Marcus Hill once again doing a great job putting a lot of pressure on the rim thats something he loves to do is get in the paint and finish over defenders Dean hangs in the air and finishes over Huntley Hatfield tough take by The Freshman go RoR told us he is just the nicest guy but he plays with some aggressiveness on the court taking it at the NC State Defenders Conley Hatfield tips it up Kanye Jones Rises up for it two minutes topse second Music half Jaden Taylor got a hand on it as we saw in that play Upstate looking to run a lot more ball screens in the second half thats something we saw from coach Marty RoR during his time at Drake they ran a lot of ball screens and thats something that propelled them to go on major runs during his six years there Dean was reaching up for the basketball they call a hold on herd Bryce herd The Freshman well you saw Taylor got his hand on it number eight herd number seven last year was when the rule change went into effect that that you could wear any number now herd the first number seven in NC State basketball history this is the 115th year wolfback basketball Taylor the first number eight Casey you had that option last year but nobody on the team last year we got another whistle here nobody on the team last year went with one of the the new numbers did did you consider it at all I never did never did um I wore number 14 I wore it in high school and you know it had worked well for me at NC State and I was just like you know why not stick stick with it fans getting a little Restless here as NC States been called for a couple of fouls in the early Applause going once again we see a Mr Dean all over the court hes staying active keeping the ball alive is scoring 12 points in this game and his freshman debut weve got to start a campaign for him you know I was seeing online as Hill has another strong take hes starting to get hot I seeing online you know the allame team of division one and D2 and D3 some great names across the country can we start a campaign I didnt see Mr Dean on that list Mr uh he has got to be on that list as one of the best names Jaden Taylor running the floor Taylor Applause its good to see jayen Taylor get involved scoring his F first buckets tonight hes going to be such an important piece for NC State his senior year what he brings offensively but also he was vocal last year about he wanted to take on that defensive role he wanted to be he said the Dey the ACC defensive player of the year theres not that many guys that take that kind of pride in playing defense Casey I know you did Jaden Taylor was a guy who took a lot L of pride in getting stops on the defensive end he had a symbol where he would put up a lock symbol whenever he got valuable stops and you know thats something that every team needs every team needs that highle Defender and I think hes starting to improve on that more this year than he was last Applause year Hill the hesitation and the L but hes showing us something here in the first couple of minutes of the second half half Marcus is super aggressive super aggressive eight points in three and a half minutes think about Elite scores right I mean it doesnt take him long he came out of halftime in a different mode that first half he looked like he was just trying to figure figure it out feel the game out second half hes a new player oconnell to the bench Trey Parker in along with Taylor and Hill and herd and Huntley Hatfield and a foul underneath as Huntley Hatfield pushed by helter Hoff only half Fields tough to keep off the rim has an excellent feel for tracking which direction the ball comes off Music Hunley Hatfields thats his first missed shot fighting to get it back and a whistle and another foul helter Hoff Music again again we said earlier look hes got his hands full tonight and thats his third foul NC State is just playing physical right I mean as you see from Brandon Huntley half field keeping the ball alive I mean its looking like theyre just starting to attack them down low no look pass from Parker Spartan spotted that another deflection thats Skinner on the perimeter before Johnson reaches in and now the fouls starting to accumulate on the Spartans thats their fourth of the half for Johnson that is his second driveing kick a tailor three is left short this is Harris Britt Harris into the paint book The Lefty hook not there Huntley Hatfields got eight and theyre really establishing him and getting the ball into the painted area strong move by Huntley hfield has a smaller Defender moral scoring easy baskets at The Rim thats something that NC State is doing a lot this game theyre scoring a lot of easy baskets which propelled them to get a significant lead Hatfields got 8 toight he scored 13 a game at Louisville a year ago after the turnover Parker no look lob and herd how did he put that in young fella is starting to get going for this NC State team time out USC Spartans Casey I think theyre having fun theyre having a blast as we can see from Bryce herd Music n e Music e e Applause NC state has opened up a 6441 lead here early going second half Marcus Hill with eight points already in the half back with ACC champ Casey morcel Im Andrew Sanders NC State coming out with full court pressure out of the break Harris able to push it ahead into the front Court this is book and the Kiwi Ford back to Harris with 15 to shoot floor spacing not great for the Spartans doesnt matter they get it to Carmelo Atkins for the three and even though USC Upstate made that shot NC States pressure has made this USC Upstate team very uncomfortable its the first career basket for Atkins The Freshman deep three Parker its his second of the game Trey Parker showing a lot of confidence even though its his first game has look like hes been here before hes going to knock down the three to go along with you know his explosiveness that gets all the all the Impressions online on Tik Tok and Instagram as Harris cues up a three ball not this time but then to add in coach Kei says he thinks he could be a lock down Defender Trey Parker hitting shots clears up opportunities for him to drive and be explosive at The Rim but as you mentioned he can be a a really highle Defender he has a good feel for guarding and keeping up with guys and its essential for him to be as complete as possible didnt hit the laye that time but to your point right that time he gets closed down on shot fake and a blow by Harris shoots over Parker and he was stripped itll be two shots for Harris when we come back from this media timeout some Applause talking to you Im telling what to do I dont want to talk to Music you for e e Music Music eighth year for NC State head coach Kevin gats who didnt like some of the foul calls he was having some fun with the refs as we were going to break and Casey you probably know him better than anybody no player under coach Gates has started more games for him at NC State then you what can you tell us about the leader of the wolf pack well you know it was a great opportunity um starting all staring starting the amount of games that I did here at NC State um you know it was just cool to kind of see the build up and US figure things out um as time went on last year um you know it was cool to figure out a recipe that work we had tried so many different lineups throughout my time here um and the fact that we figured something out to where we could hang us two banners um theres nothing like it yeah figuring it out is an understatement uh that was just an incredible run that didnt just take Raleigh by storm but you know the entire country captivated by it you ever think about that you saw the numbers that that you guys played in front of on TV against Duke it was like 12 million you know its crazy because like when youre in it you try to block it out right I mean literally when youre in it youre so focused on the next game um that you kind of its its delayed when trying to realize the impact that you have on on the community so it was cool to come back once we had got back from the final four to come back and just see all of the support that we had each time I mean NC State fans were very supportive throughout the run and dropped my entire time at NT State Spartans trying to go quickly against the pressure and book able to bank it home second basket for book his first four points in his career now earlier when we were showing off the hardware the Rings the ACC Championship Ring has some ice cream scoops on it and that was you know the the five Scoops right five wins in five days three ball for Kanye Jones too strong Parker Showtime to pass yes its good to see Brion pass get going but you said you found a recipe that works I do have to ask what was your ice cream order after CC Road wets I was very simple um I only I got the same thing every time um but usually it was vanilla and I had to add sprinkles cuz that was essential Thats The Scouting Report vanilla with Music sprinkles pass pass in and Applause out a steal by Applause book jones was still hanging on the cylinder there and thatll take this to the Under 12 it we will pack ball when we come back Inc States gotten out running Freon pass Trey Parker putting on a show all right Music one 6 Music we Applause Music 1 well the depth of this new look NC State team has been on display with some balanced scoring five players with eight or more points Hill with eight points just in this half alone he had it all in the first three and a half minutes of the half to push him up to be the leading score along with Mr Dean who has 12 for the Spartans this is what you want to see if youre NC State exactly youre going youre going to want want to have balance scoring if youre this NC State team um still trying to figure out who could be the primary or goto score so the fact that theyre balance is a step in the right direction OK Connell knocked down a couple of Threes in the first half that was a calling card of that that final four team a year ago is some nights it was going to be you it be DJ Burns or DJ horn maybe a Jaden Taylor um what did that do for your team that it wasnt one guy having to really carry that 20 point a game scoring load yeah it makes you tough to guard um you know playing with a guy like DJ burn DJ Horn uh they they draw a lot of attention um and the fact that uh you know other guys could step up on other on different nights um it it just makes it tough because you know you just dont know what to expect if youre the opposing team McNeil The Freshman inside theyve been doubling the post all night good ball movement finds Taylor for a three and its Marcus Hill on the recycle Baseline Drive marus H Marcus Hill has been super aggressive in this second half Gregory continues to get to the rim with a quick answer hes got 13 so for USC Upstate hey we got a push underneath and thats going to be the fourth on the big man helter Hoff and again there without probably who would have been their starting five brillan Garcia so really thin at that position and it looks like helter Hoffs just going to stay in with that fourth foul and Brin Garcias absence um is definitely significant for USC Upstate um as we talked with Marty RoR earlier I mean his activity on the defensive end provide is expected to provide a different spark uh for this USC Upstate Gregory bowls over oconnell itll be a blocking foul and that should be a one and one no pardon me they put that foul up quick so that is the sixth foul Spartans will be in the bonus the remaining 10 and 1 half minutes of this game and again thats where theyve had a lot of success at the line tonight 16 of 17 from the free throw line deep three Gregory but hes hit just about everything else tonight Casey Marcus Hill he really is able to change his speed well yeah as we see on that play there probing um that change of speed makes you tougher to guard um because you just dont know what to expect as a Defender and Marcus Hill he puts a lot of pressure on the rim taking full advantage of uh USC upstates lack of Def defensive Presence at the r Hill into double figures he did that 31 times last year but maybe more impressively he scored 20 or more at Bowling Green 19 times 19 of his 34 starts its tough to do at 20 and he had 30 three times does not hit the free throws there de was disrupted by Music Applause Taylor in a season opener the officials right fans fans dont like a softer foul call as a player you know the officials are going to try to set the tone in the in the early part of the season right exactly right and see I mean these officials want the game to be as clean as possible and some officials do prefer the game to you know let the guys play a little more um and in this game I mean these officials have done a phenomenal job keeping the game clean um and all the players are protected from physical play speaking of Mr Deans going to be called for a foul here holding the Jersey NC State in the bonus Mr Dean has a bright future with this USC Upstate program um hes going to have to build on this game tonight making his presence known on the offensive and defensive end 13 points in in his Collegiate debut and doing it against a power four opponent hes going to get plenty more opportunities they play obviously tonight here at NC State at Virginia Tech in blackburg they go to Winston Salem and Play Wake four so three ACC teams at Iowa thatll be a homecoming for Coach RoR hes from the state of Iowa and again was just at Drake for six years theyll play at South Carolina too so they will really be tested before they go in a big South play as book its an uncontested layup as a player did you prefer for them to let you play a little bit especially as a guy that could really lock down defensively or did you prefer a tighter whistle I prefer to play um I was I was definitely a fig I I was definitely a physical Defender and um theres nothing worse than than getting pulled out of the game uh for cheap fouls that just something early on just like youre feeling out the other team yeah yeah you definitely something you feel in the game hey theyre calling it this way exactly exactly and you usually feel it out uh after that first one after that after those first few fouls in the game then you usually have a good idea okay these are the types of refs that we have tonight Hills going to come out pass in there along with mcneel and Taylor oconnell and of course Huntley Hatfield who made the first and gets the second as well allow NC State set up just a little fullcourt pressure from Brion pass Gregory out there with Skinner and Dean and book and Applause Atkins big man running the floor you got to feed him thats something that we talked about earlier Brandon Huntley Hadfield is super light on his feet he could run in transition guard multiple positions what can he not do scanner pours in the three Isaiah scanner whos shot at about 30 5 from the bonus spere a year ago at Mount St jento College one thing we learned about USC upstairs theyre going to play hard to the very end Huntley Hatfield called for an offensive foul that was something an issue he had against uh lee McCrae in the exhibition that was too close for comfort for NC State but yeah he makes the free throws he runs the floor he can step out a little bit too a great question what cant he do and so get a little teaching moment here for Coach Keats the only thing that can stop him maybe is foul trouble foul trouble exactly um thats something that hes always struggled with even at Louisville its foul trouble um because he is so physical sometimes he could be overly physical um and that can Propel him to get in that kind of situation so the offensive foul away from the ball thats his fourth oconnell picks the pocket of Gregory euros step and Taylor with the lay Applause in N State shot at over 65 in the first half and they really havent cooled off much and its hard to cool off when youre getting those kind of looks thats something that NC State is looking to do theyre looking to run and transition and get easy baskets as a as a there from Jaden Taylor Carmelo Atkins made a three earlier hes two for two from the floor crosscourt pass to Brion pass for Applause three Brion pass is so confident thats something that hes improved oning a lot this off season Brion pass makes his second triple hes got 14 points now huge night his previous career high seven its a career night his senior year just getting started pass in the wolf pack e e Music e e Music not much more than a month ago both North and South Carolina so impacted by Hurricane Helen and the Spartans were huge in the relief efforts in the Spartanburg area of South Carolina as they went to schools helped feed the community their home court JB the GB Hodge Center was open for the community to shelter in is estimated that you know as they had power there off a generator they were able to save up to 80 lives uh for those in the community who needed power for ventilators other medical devices and so uh the impact of the Spartans on their Community its good to see um teams get out and make a difference um and be more than athletes I mean theres so much going on um in terms of preparing for these games and the fact that they made time to go out and and have a difference or make a difference in the community uh shows how value how much they value people around them coach RoR again just his first year this is his first game as the head coach the new era for UNC Upstate and he said most of the staff without power for about 3 days after Hurricane Helen the players living in the dorms they were without power for about 5 days Taylor Taylor will go to the line here and so really great to see all of the outpouring uh of of support to our neighbors you know in Western North Carolina in the upstate area it takes a village it takes a village to all come together and recover for something like that and the fact that members all over North Carolina and all over from from surrounding states came in um and and chipping in um little pieces just to overcome this storm Jaden Taylor makes the free throw hes now matched his jersey number eight points here on opening night well for an NC State team that had a 19point lead at half time in their public exhibition against Le McCrae saw that lead disappear as the second half went on its been a much better second half for them is theyve been able to extend the lead here over the visitors from Spartenburg I think they one thing they learn is to continue keeping up high energy NC State got comfortable in that last game and as you see in this game theyre starting to theyre continuing the pressure and which leads to easy opportunities on the offensive end pass playing with confidence theres mle Brooks cleaning it Applause up a nine nothing wolfback run in the last couple of minutes the lead is ballooned to nearly 30 and I think is this on Adkins it is away from the ball to foul another look Applause eight points now for Middlebrooks along with six rebounds its a lot of movement for NT state which clears up easy opportunities once again we see Ben Middlebrooks finish strong at The Rim earlier in that possession what theyve done a lot tonight they doubled the post that time middle Brooks got soloed up look you played with a guy last year that Drew a lot of double teams what does that do for you on the perimeter clears up a lot of opportunities a lot of opportunities and thats something that you FC Upstate is trying to get NC State to do is shoot jump shots which is why theyre doubling um but NC State is still finding a way to take advantage of USC upstat lacking Rim presence so Middlebrooks into double figures now four for the wolfb pass and Hill the leading scores at 14 book with a strong drive and theres Styles met him at The Rim Applause Music and an offensive foul on book as pass was tripped up trying to get around his screen last year during your historic run modara was a huge piece of that with his rebounding his shot blocking he can score two uh theres a lot that goes into playing the four for Coach Keats well in my opinion playing the four for Coach Keats is the best position honestly I mean because you get so many opportunities um to you know just for spacing purposes you get opportunities to drive opportunties to shoot um in transition and something that we did last year with modaro was drag screens which which propelled him to get a lot of pick and pop opportunities which puts a lot of pressure on Defenders on the opposing team Bon pass got a nice hand again a career night for him shattered his career high previous was seven hes got 14 McNeil going to work Middlebrooks again trying to clean up tap not there either but he saves it to Applause mcneel interesting so you feel like in your opinion thats the the best position that puts you in a good spot so Styles and weve also seen Dennis Parker Jr there in that spot tonight and they flourished well if in the pick roll opportunities right if you switch usually the fourman could have a a smaller guard on them which is what NC State took full advantage of last year Styles over the back hell pick up his fourth foul I dont know Brit Harris knows this yet but these are going to be some pressure free throws or pardon me theyre still in the one and one there is a uh free chicken promotion get a free chicken sandwich you missed two free throws this place get gets loud for the free chicken Applause Styles comes out Parker Jr replacing Applause him so Harris makes them both Harris behind his back got to get rid of it its Atkins carmelo for Applause three and mcneels going to be going to the line looking for his first career points when we come back the under four Music timeouts e e this game tonight its the performance of Brion pass as we can see here doubling his career high with 14 points and hes just taking his aggressiveness to another level hes played significant minutes tonight A little over 20 minutes and hes taking full advantage of the opportunity heo shooting putting a lot of pressure on the rim hes a huge asset for this NC State team he has looked comfortable to say the least the senior from Reedville North Carolina you know he scored over 2200 points in his high school career at rville high school speaking of a an elite High School score theres Paul mcneels first point as a college player Drew McConnell dumps it down low for book Atkins with a Nifty move almost had it taken away by Middlebrooks nine to shoot Harris took it in amongst the trees and was lucky to get it back Mr Dean to the line NC state has done a a better job in the second half with closing out realizing that USC Upstate hasnt been shooting well with less than 20 theyre clo theyre short closing um forcing USC Upstate to shoot tough shots Mr Dean calmly knocks in the first free throw and the fans of chicken not Applause happy 90 points for NC State just under three minutes left Mr Dean once again hes going to come out if thats the last we see of him he gets a high five from coach RoR and if thats the last we see of him Dean comes out 22 minutes 13 points in his first collegate game as we see Kevin Kei starting to clear his bench go further down his bench this is more of an opportunity for guys to showcase what they can do to get to gain more minutes as the season Applause advances Atkins deep three rims off Parker with a long Outlet oh Middlebrooks got landed on and in that I think we got a foul here on Middlebrooks then plays hard I was a little confused there at least from our vantage point I thought he was just on the ground and got landed on but uh the fans here are fine with it they want another shot at a sandwich we see K KJ ke has checked in the game you love to see it if youre NC State he missed them both this place is rocking one of the loudest Roars of the Applause night let see if they cant get KJ Keats a shot or two before this games over Skinner second effort for him one thing one thing I know for sure is KJ Keith is definitely looking to score okay he didnt have the opportunity to score last year and the fact that hes out here with the significant amount of time to get a good looks up I know hes been waiting for this Applause opportunity Skinner at the line for one Parker going to come out Jordan snow will come in those are some nice Pink Shoes he has only two of the returners for reny Applause State itll stay here you know Casey weve talked a lot about last year understandably so right theres two shiny new banners up there but um bringing back quite a few guys having to replace a lot yourself included you were one of the leaders on the team last year who do you see as maybe taking over a uh in a leader ship role yeah from the returners for sure Michael conell and Ben middle Brooks I think those will be the the two main uh leaders because they played the biggest roles on our run and also Jaden Taylor um they add so much experience and they know exactly what Kevin Keats is looking for here McConnell turns it over Parker throws the alley and herd throws it down reverse Jam Applause 65 seconds Applause remain a step back McNeil his first career three its good to see the young fell score Applause so were starting to see right we talk about look theres seven guys playing in their final year of Collegiate basketball but its Parker and herd and mcneel theyre really excited about these three freshmen theyre a young group theyre a young group and one thing thats good to see is that theyre playing with a lot of confidence you know after each maze shot theyre theyre screaming boom and you know its just theres just a lot of passion um that theyre playing with and you know its some its significant that they keep that same confidence throughout the year its a long year there going to be a lot of ups and downs but keeping that confidence is going to take them a long way how was your confidence as a freshman when did it when did things start clicking for you where you realize hey man I could play in this leag yeah I mean it starts on the defensive end when you figure out you can you can guard guys um then things get easier because at the end of the day all of these coaches in the in the country theyre all looking for guys who can guard at a high level um and that you know there theres always an opportunity whenever you can play defense good pass by CJ Rich who the only returner from a year ago to have played he gets the assist there fans want KJ Keats to score Music it Atkins breaks the timeline with seven maybe one more shot Trey Parker will dribble it out and NC State starts the season 1 and0 with a 97 66 win over the Spartans this
