want to go into the ACC with some confidence under your belt Speaking of tough itll be tough for the Bears without Justin Pippen again tonight missing his second consecutive game And also Reedus Petritus not available for Mark Matson as the Golden Bears were without those two when they beat Northwestern State here last Saturday And it was a struggle for a while against Northwestern State before Cal finally got it going in the second half Well they did but their veterans took over their day aims A couple of their seniors got going for them but TT Carr is a guy you want to watch Hes really helped them Heres Chris Bell Goes inside to Lee Dort Five to shoot There is TT Carr Too strong with the three and the rebound A good box out inside by Morgan State And its grabbed by Christian Meeks Watch for this team to be flying through the post Getting a lot of backup And Alfred Warel Jr missing a three And theres John Camden clearing it for Cal as the Morgan State Bears are 2 and8 this season Theyve played a tougher schedule this year A lot of years theyll play some lower level even division 2 teams Kevin Broad as their head coach did not do that this year Hes challenged this team They got a really a tough road trip right here in the Bay Area and then down south Theyll play USF over on the hilltop on Sunday then wrap up their West Coast swing down in LA against Lyola Marry Mount is Day Ames missing the pull up and the rebound grabbed by Christian Meeks for Morgan State Now this groups not afraid as you say to play good competition Theyll play hard Roxy Morgan State team definitely plays at a high level and tough Lee Dort the steal Hes home free and Lee Dort maybe got away with a travel Well he looked behind him said Wait a minute Theres nobody chasing me And I think he might have taken an extra step Official set play on Dor with a steal and bucket for the games first points Oregon State team that was picked to come in fourth this season in the Mak They made the Mak championship game last year where they lost to Northolk State and Aaron pass but were getting a foul on Cal You can see Lee Dor now just kind of stepping up his opponent didnt meet the pass He went down and said Thank you very much But Cals playing tougher defense this year Roxy Theyre pressuring out on the floor Theyre picking up full court Theyd like this to be a fast pace One thing thats been an issue for Cal really ever since been the UCLA win was the sluggish slow starts theyve been getting off to And it its frustrated Mark Matson It has but he certainly has a second half team thats been outstanding the second half You just dont want to rely on that every game Theyve gotten away with it to this point on the drive all the way to the bucket and the layup missed by Alfred Warel Jr and Cal with the rebound Here comes the freshman TT Carr D who had a really good allaround game against Northwestern State last Saturday Theyre high in rebounds to Dor Hes got all four cheering pass set up by John Camden the veteran the senior from Delaware Really made that play look easy for his teammate Now top four the Morgan State Bears Eugene Alvin coming off a careerhigh 17 They beat Niagara this past Wednesday 8173 snapping the seven game losing streak That threepointer from Eugene Allen and last touch by Cal will stay at this end Its a Morgan State ball Theres that last play You got John Camden on the drive Youve got big fella Dort over the top as his man helps out They run that play along WITH THE INBOUND MISSING EVERYTHING TO THE BASELINE cheering without Royal Jr Rough start for Morgan State offensively Day Ames spinning Ames has his shot blocked but a foul will send Day A to the line for Cal You see the pace that Cal wants to play against him Kevin Brs got his work cut out for him He knows hes got some young guys playing without one of his top players which is a tough loss Elijah Davis double figures guy you know So theyre really theyre going to have to play a little shorthanded tonight Day Ames nails the first 79 foul shooter averaging 18 points per game And Ames who had 20 in the win against Northwestern State double figures in 10 of the 11 games hes got five 20 point games already this year Two things go to hustle play again by CT Car keeping it alive and a whistle and its a foul on John Camden diving in after the loose ball Yeah you dont mind those fouls Roxy If a coach is going youre going to pick up a foul you want to pick up an aggressive foul Thats that that foul is okay Officiating crew Clarence Armstrong tonight working with Jamal Spearman Claire Aubrey for a sign by the ACC as Morgan State has misfired on their first four shots They may have trouble scoring against the stingy Cal defense pretty big at each position Christian Thats why theyre doing this West Coast guys passing losing Christian got his back and the first points for Morgan State Thats a big play by the junior He just stayed with it from Haz Illinois Tough tough play You know hes got 28 offensive rebounds on the year Thats not a surprise Thats not a fluke Last year was a division 2 junior college allame University of Missouri St Louis Chris Bells in short the baseline the rebound Lawson brings it up for Oregon State now transition on the move and Chris Bell clears it for the Bears Cowboys I need to be specific Hes referring to John turns the corner and the step back in the short and the rebound Christian Oliver for the State get some stops Theyre going to run that off Very deliberate They get a lot of bad cuts Princeton type offense really got turn against David left the ball behind the freshman off the bench Kevin Rodri from Lee Dort down lows got a mismatch inside back to poked away from John C Steal from Rosier smallest man on the floor trying to front him They just missed him Christian Oliver goes inside after the shot blocked by Chris Bell pushing his D after behind the back drives left the short rebound Chris Bell and Bell on the first three shoot applause 52 Cal the early stages at Hos Pavilion on this Friday night as the Golden Bears search of win number 11 Like our our attire right here I dont know if we got a chance to the fans got that but were going bowling arent we The lays of course for the Hawaii Bowl which will be coming up on Christmas Eve as Chris Bell shooting two after foul And one more for Bell who is a 90 foul shooter Its now 72 California Can he can do that Roxy I mean he can get on the board and score not only the three but he can shoot free throws It count as a team shooting it well The Bears are 77 California Golden Bears shoot this but then whats interesting is the Oregon State Bears are also 77 as Chris Bell nearly lost Heres Dell Sets up fires a three They must need a triple But hes Bell whos been struggling the last four Yeah Yes he has But you know how you get yourself going Roxy We just talked about it defensively Thats a steal from Bell What does he do He comes down hits a big shot Defense can get your offense going Last four games Chris Bell a combined one for 10 from three That is a welcome sight from Mark Matson to see Chris Bell knock one down The floater spins out on the baseline from Eugene Alvin whos been playing well for Kevin Rogers in Oregon State talking to Kevin about it earlier today and I asked him about he said you know hes even played better than I thought he got some ability no question a lot of guys step back screaming California lead you want to watch a guy he can do that oneonone defender Hes wearing number 15 tonight There was an issue with his regular number 21 jersey and thats why hes wearing the cheering number 50 games and he throws it away looking for Dorsy on the wing Maybe he was confused by his maybe he didnt know his his teammate jersey But you can see Chris Bell and you know its just funny how this goes Roxy but its not has been struggling offensively but also defensively Now he comes out and plays some aggressive defense and he comes back and just knocks it down He can flat shoot it gets a breather First appearance for Milos Elich for 610 senior from Serbia The transfer transfer brother had a terrific game the other night for Sam Houston helped Sam Houston pick up the win against Oregon State by Robson One of those rare breeds Four years of the same sport Now clock down to 10 Here is Chris Bell as grabbed by Marlon Harris the senior from Englewood off the bench His first foul for Morgan State Yeah its just hard to get up and Scott Lawson when he goes over the top of you senior from Capitol Heights Maryland He can score it but hes an assist guy too About a little under five a game 92 from the line You dont want to foul him Ls playing some guys you know has a new lineup on the floor Roxy hasnt played a lot Heres that zone You know theyll switch defenses on you So Morgan States going to the two3 matchup Chris Bell fires three You can play his own against a lot of teams but if you got Chris Bell on your side youre not going to be in a zone for long Hes a zone buster Better find him if youre going to play zone Rob Lawson off balance draws the foul and its on Nolan Dorsy of California First called on Dorsy Yeah you like the Cal Bears You want to see the Cal Bears from long distance Tee it up Chris Bell He can knock it down fell from deep Cal leads the net Yeah And you know Im a little different Roxy I dont look so much at the net I I like the fact that we could be you know Im saying to our team we could be 12 one going into ACC uh conference opener And if you can do that and play Louisville which theyre not going to look ahead right yet but youre 12 one you go into the opener you get that game youre in good good shape um you still got to win some games And Id rather my team be playing and winning games than worrying about who youre playing the rankings I I think theres too much attention to that You definitely want to get some games just by playing in the ACC Your rank is going to go up because they touch up here in the ACC Boston goes one for two at the line and 93 foul shooter Heres the zone from Oregon State with count of 10 Theyre going to pay a little more attention probably this time to Chris Bell Theyve got to three And you know Isaiah Wilkins the the assistant coach whos scouting this game said theyre a little worried because the this team will change defenses Theyre scrappy that will change mid possession and yeah in the middle of possession theyll go from man to zone and also theyre theyre a scrappy team that likes to go get second chance points so and thats been one of Cals weaknesses and he acknowledged that we got to be better at at second you know first shot defense were good second shot we got to keep him off the glass keep things off shot at Kevin Bryce the head coach of Morgan State as TT Carr leans in and rebound by Christian meets from Morgan State but the seventh year at Morgan State now two years the head coach of Kansas he took Davidson to the NCA tournament and also had two states as an assistant at Georgia around the block for way James the senior in Southern California senior with his first points of Tonight Chris Bell and one And tonight looks like the get right game for Chris Bell Yeah And you know what Sometimes Roxy your coaches cant get you going You got to get yourself going And Chris Bell has done that Hes played both ends of the floor He has been aggressive He gets into the paint He goes over the top of you because hes 67 and he can get his own I mean hes a tough offensive player 90 foul shooter now Three for three at the line Bell has 11 He is outscoring Morgan State 117 Theyll do that Heres that defense now extending court I like it for very aggressive a little bit slow starting to get a double team inside to a slashing Christian Lawson nearly came down at 12 so high He just waited Everybody else came down Hes still in the air Thought about it The pass deflected knocked away Goes off of Dallas James and his save It belongs to Norfol State And immediately John Cam saying challenge this That was off James Whats interesting Roxy the players will say challenge it but its up to those guys on the bench Anthony Reinis over there Uh hes got hes got the the the you know board and and if he says coach challenge it hes got another look at it Its funny though theres a little delay on it so you dont they dont see what we see out here so you got to be quick on that but you trust your player but you trust the guy on your bench thats got the video board and this by looking at the replays we saw following play is under review out of bounds So the call is under review and heres what they are looking at right there It goes off the leg If James did not touch Camden this should be reversed Yeah And again John Camden heads up whos just saying Look coach challenge it Im on it I I didnt touch it And players know I mean theyre right there and so definitive And again if youre new to the rules which have changed in college basketball this year this falls under the description of a challenge play where theyve adopted kind of the NBA rule You have to have a legal timeout to be able to challenge You get one challenge a game If youre correct you get a second And that was the limit Even if youre correct again doesnt matter Youre done you have a maximum of two challenges in a game which you and I have talked about this before I music think that needs to be changed Yeah I I agree And and it might be I I think the good thing about the NCAA rules committee is they review things every year and theyll do whats right for the game And if youre unsuccessful youre done You dont have another challenge and it cost you the timeout I I personally would call these because I love the timeouts I dont want to burn a timeout but Ill use these if if you get it After review call has been overturned California basketball Yeah Yeah So you might say well is that a big deal with the score 189 Its its a big deal because you want the ball back You want to establish yourself If youre Cal you want to be playing better in the first half than youve been playing And my issue with the rule the way it is adjudicated now if youre correct why should you be penalized And lets say Cal challenges the next play and they are successful and I then youre done for the night And I think theyll end up changing that rule for that very point Theres that two3 big fires and the rebound tip to Captain Dav You dont rebound out of the zone You dont have a man responsibility You have an area You got to go find a guy in your area and keep them off the glass Cal makes the second chance put back Largest lead for Cal Golden Bears are three for five shot by Alfred Warel Jr last touch by California and belongs to Morgan State But if you like Day Ames for his ability to go oneonone like the perimeter wide hes shooting about 50 from three I dont know many people in the country are shooting 49 Thats thats ungodly HERES a three Found on the three is Alfred Warel Jr and he will go to the line and Dana Ames just picked up foul number two Yeah that was a little over aggressive on that play D say Hey I think it was a kick out there and says now we got it He lunged out his momentum and Day Ames is right There was a kick out with the right leg for Morel Yeah You know and its interesting Lexi if theres a kick out but your momentum takes you into that player which takes precedence The kick out or or the player that would have crashed into you Thats an interesting dilemma for the officials Two more for Warell Nails with first 87 cheering foul shooter transfer Southern Miss was at a couple of junior colleges last year at Southern Miss and now at Oregon State might have missed one shot and he goes three for three from the line He had 24 in the win last s last Wednesday against Niagara Was a big win for last Saturday I should say Big win without obviously one of their better players in last season and they led that game They held out That was a big time win They shot 61 from the field against Niagara in that game Nine of 20 from three and they won that game despite committing 23 turnovers Yeah And thats unusual but they played you know they got the lead And if you get the lead good things happen Id rather play with Lee Jday Ames shovels it inside to Dort Lee Dort Foul going up Its on Eugene Outman of Morgan State But you can see the size discrepancy You got Lee Dort inside and just really not a lot that you can do if youre Morgan State Thats just a mismatch every time Thats why theyre playing the zone 70 foul shooter and rolls in for Lee Dort Yeah he stepped up He stepped up in his game and this is an area that he struggled in a year ago and hes now putting the ball in the basket Hes confident A much improved player from a year ago And physically I think that has a lot to do with him how hard he worked on his body in the offseason Yeah they the staff challenge him Moxy but theyll tell you theyll give him credit He did all the work I mean he put the time in and he really came away with a better body Hes now conditioned and playing the best basketball of his career Sebastian Hernandez Cal strength and conditioning coach will be the first one to tell you Lee Do Yeah good question Now Cals in his own Alvin Shot clock winding down Alvin too strong on a three and the rebound John Camden for draw to that success Candon down the lane Candon lays it in First points for John Camden tonight What a clever player He knows hes going to be guarded hard at the threepoint line and hes been driving Three missed at the other end by Walter Peg Jr after missing last couple of games for Morgan State And it belongs to Cal on the base Well you can see Cals making a concerted effort to play that zone They want to take advantage of a team thats only shot 29 from three and theyre 0 for seven from three So thats a smart move on Mark Mass and the staffs part You go for the lob inside for Dors Broken up Loose ball picked up by TT CARR AND CAR is hammered from behind by Dallas James Second foul on James Kevin Ro is not happy Giving up that offensive rebound screaming John Camden getting into the act for Cal And the Golden Bears largest lead of the night ended up coaching one of our players uh Maris Caitley as well So um you know basketballs a small world One more for TT Carr And speaking of Maris Kaitley he is the only player to have played for both Cal and Oregon State David Felman with the he part of a tremendous recruiting class which you have Well he was he was really a good player a local player and he was one of one of the top shooting classes he had Cal going back to the manto man now They decided they were going to get out of his own guard to man pressure on that really pressure that class that was a part of also had Leon and a jumper from Oregon State That group of guys Roxy had some success and you know uh so much of basketball are your players You can first get some good players to Dominic Magguire as TT both teams being aggressive Now look at look at if Im mistaken David Harris was also Yeah We had some players and they were local players That was what was so uh interesting You know its always nice when you win with local players TC Carr local player Nice step through and dump by Christian Oliver I like that California native from Pasadena Look back I think Kevin brought his legs playing out here in California These guys can come home play from their families Its always great to bring your players back from their hometown family cheering What a pass GT car is really he really stepped up in just 50 lead in his first start 14 points seven assists against Northwest Car with three assists and feed JOHN CAM FOLLOWS cheering UP HIS OWN that came on a fast break again that was a kick ahead by Carr who found a streaking John Cam to the basket I mean does a great job Prototypical point guard that kicks it ahead You got to love those guys Largest lead for California Down here is Christian Oliver And Oliver fouled on the hook and two shots lead first Oh its just that was taking it to the basket And how about this look Go over here and look back Look at that over the top Just great job Lee Dort doesnt bring it down but TT Carr with a picture perfect pass over the car 71 foul shooter The 610 a senior from Pasadena Junior College down last year because of a couple of years ago See if Kevin Rose can get his guys back Hes got some guys here cheering and he lost their top five scorers from a year ago championship over the top to drops down into a jump Dorsy got ripped right back by Wson and Wson on the drive and he gets the roll I love Ron Lawson Roxy hes an aggressive player Hes athletic Hes relentless And Isaiah you know talked about that this teams a scrappy team You cant take that for granted Dont battle GT Car burst down the lane The drop off in the lane had great footwork avoided the traveler Waited for the traffic to clear and just laid it up Gs doing a nice job finding the big Dorton double digits with tes A great first half towards way out is Rob Lawson Christian Oliver and off balance throws up a wild shot Chris Bell pulls it down for didnt have his feet set in that shot Five rebounds already for Bell who is returned to form tonight Dort step lead Yeah I like the way he leaned in He was trying to draw a foul Lee Doris really had a great first down Thats a good sign for the Tough runner and throwing up a shot thats not even close Was losing back the other way Here was Bell He is fouled and Chris Bell is flying on the baseline Well go to the line Well you want to talk about a guy thats come to play tonight How about Lee Nord Hes there He presents himself He scores Hes all around the basket Double figures for the big fella And were only five minutes four minutes to go in the game Lee Dort coming up big music play like this Hes going to be a formidable foe for his opponents as we get ready for ACC play Well Cals got a lot of weapons and when Justin Pippens back certainly the guards of him Day Ames the shooting of John Camden and Chris Bell that to me when when Cal gets cheering into ACC play Lee Dort could be the most important player they have Well and early in this year for most of this preseason Cals had four five guys in double figures That fifth guy was Lee Dort Lee Dort kind of that things were not going his way and and then and obviously now hes almost going to be back in double figures but theyre playing without Justin Pipp Its a big loss and he will get Ben ready Theyre trying to get him ready for ACC play They may even get him ready for the upcoming games against this club He was a game time decision tonight He did go through a shoot around So just right now managing it dayto day suddenly be a tough game against Columbia then they have a few days before ACC starts available right now Look at that game knowing want to play that game ACC without another game under his belt and long stay So my guess is hell play But my rationale why is theres four on the shot clock by the way But my rationale Ben why Lee Dor is so important to this team in conference play is the production hes giving you at both ends of the floor The presence he is defensively and lets face it theyre a little shorthanded inside as guitar way with the shot the sophomore from Sagal Well and Lee Dorf can give you that Hes really rebounded well last two games scoring has been down but he was scoring earlier in the end of the season Hes scoring again now I mean hes hes really improved his passion tournament especially look without Petra we dont know when hell be back as the runner John Cameron the guy thats been carrying car when theyve been struggling hes got some good things look at Dorsy and TTor cheering he is labeled by his coaching staff their best defender and you can see why he is all over the court right now Everyone defensive players a pretty good time now making really tough is a really good offensive player down the lane foul and one for man But you see we talked about Nolan Dorsy you know whos been injured this year but watch him just jump the passing lanes Hes playing denial defense and he just snaps his head and makes it tough and feeds his teammate TT Carr for the easy two The wall six for 10 for the line this year The cheering transfer from Crossber State the rebound There is Dors securing Dors with two fouls with 210 left in the hand Chris Bell He missed the open right here in transition First to the basket and a rebound for the top of that players in a three But theres a guy thats been on fire for Cal Hes really been picking teams apart with his threepoint shooting And Kevin Broad is much wisely calls a timeout See if they can slow this Bears attack Camden 43 from downtown Hes been on fire I mean when he gets his feet set Roxy that ball goes down up and over I mean hes got a great release He shows you what he can do music Heres a production breakdown Starters against role players and bench players for Cal And the starters are averaging almost 70 points per game That is the fifth most in the country in terms of production from their starting five Yeah thats quite a quite a discrepancy there But you know theres a reason too They theyre playing without giving him a liftoff and Dorsy coming back I think catch him up Junior Here comes Ken A nice feed ahead Mishandled but recovered by Nolan Dorsy And then El missed the layup but hes fouled And theyre going to call it Goend instead Yeah goend Give the basket to Milos Elish Good Good call Great pass by John Camden Watch this pass that Oh my goodness Fullourt And now you got the dish right here Another pass You have two great passes by John Camden on the on the same sequence to leading for to a basket 25point lead for Cal with 62 seconds left in the half And TT Carr might have a little blood We should probably talk about Cal making the extra pass and their assist total They were only at about 9 10 assists a year ago Theyre at about 16 now Theyve really increased their ability to to make get easier baskets off of passes and nine in the first half tonight assist Barry Parsons the Cal athletic trainer checking on following play is under review for a potential flood foul So its under review for a potential flagrant that caused this with TT cheering Carr Theres where he cheering got hit At the review we have nothing on the play Quick review Thats a good breakdown Thank you Clarence Armstrong We have nothing on Yep Well we like that when officials say play on Well heres Cal now Theyre going to try to still maintain their pressure This has been a good defensive half by the Cal Bears I know their offense has been good but their defense has had a lot to do with their success offensively And TT Carr with the cotton balls Oh hes tough Shoved up his nose And they need him on the floor in the absence of Justin Pippen He doesnt want to come out Rex theres a defense and now a steal And a foul will get part of the line applause Its on Robson TT Carr at the line Second on Lawson Seven for Carr as Alfred Warel Jr comes back for Morgan State Actually Im worried about Mark Madsons halftime cheering speech Hes going to have to adjust it You guys are playing well Lets keep it going I used to say that once coaching says No do what you did the first half Sometimes you dont have to say a word Your team knows like what Im seeing Keep doing whatever youre doing Just keep doing this 27point lead Seven straight for Cal trying to close the half strong Its been a real strong Lawson chs up a three The line rebound dropped by Car This is also a halftime walk starting to make sure theyre right earlier today Chris and shoot three and a rebound grabbed by Morg State That will take us to halftime A 50point first half for California shoot 61 from the floor as they suffocate Morgan State The Morgan State Bears just 32 5023 at the half California Yeah you like got to like the Bears Roxy Theyre playing I mean theyre out Theyre pressuring I like the 50 points but I like the 23 too Thats a great number if youre trying to win a game Defend 2002 2003 You had 12 straight wins Comes in at home No place like home Roxy Hos Pavilion been good to us Good to Mark Madson Back door A nice slip to the bucket and the layin You see Alvin that was a welldesigned play coming in at halftime by Morgan And thats what they do Roxy Thats what coach Wilson had talked about They can do that John Camden drives Camden is fouled and its on Christian Oliver Yeah thats been a big change for Cal from a year ago Theyre only theyve got some good shooters but theyre really putting on the deck now Good shooter If you can learn to drive draw fouls and pitch Thats going to help your offense Cal two shots for Camden 87 for the line But you talk about efficiency Cal not only shooting over 60 for the game theyve got nine assists in the first half and theyre shooting now make it 13 for 14 from the line 90 plus three all the way and Christian Oliver whos made just one all season clears the rebound Carr drops it off to Lee Dory fumbles and had it stripped last touch by Alfred Warel Jr And it stays with California broken up on the ends and doors runs it down Good car Last touch by Car with a turnover Only their fourth at the net Well give credit to Morgan State They were relentless on that last possession I think I think uh Coach Broad has had a little something to do with the halftime speech there Hes got his guys coming out playing hard Still looking for their first made three Morgan State is 0 for 10 Nice pass by Lawson to cutting Christian Oliver has twice in a row now theyve attacked the inside So they found some things at halftime to attack Kalan doing a great job of executing it Hands of Lawson poking it out of bounds Yeah hes talking about Lawson being a good athlete but hes also their top assist guy I mean nice dish Hes got seven assists on the night And looks like we have double technicals versus some joint as Jamal Spearman comes in Signals for the double technical Yeah I think they involved the technical on and its also personal and the third personal each for Rob Lawson of Morgan State and Day Yeah Well thats a loss You got to really get your composure You dont want to give up fouls especially technical time against and the legal screen offensive to second on John Heres what Lawson did to get his into kind of got his way A little push I didnt see much there I dont know They could have that one music Not a lot going on there Oh there was a little shoulder bump I didnt see what Daniel Haynes did Maybe his retaliation Oxy family or son plays hockey That was pretty soft inside again and the flip No from Christian Me and Cal John C clears Ti car pushes up the floor DJ was looking for a CALL back or change it up Tristan Oliver tough shot in the key He banks it in banks open applause Friday night I dont know I go to the bank to pass the way this shot went down the window open on Friday I dont know the out I like the way that so does Kevin brought us some squads playing card too strong the rebound Yeah Theres a three Thats way off junior out of bounds to Kevin Now 0 for 11 from deep the Morgan State Bears Yeah Kevin brought us two stints at Georgetown and John Thompson one of his mentors and he still every day when he walks in the gym has John Thompson not a bad guy tell you that great by Chris and there was some contact Manson said wheres the foul man didnt just fall down he got knocked down tough Finish by Chris Bell Hes played well tonight 15 for Bell tonight A really good effort and a much needed performance Not just for Bell but he needs fouled by Bell as the shot clock was about to applause expire And the first on Bell If you like Chris Bell youll like what hes been doing Not only the start of the first half but the start of the second half Hes on fire Hes looking to get his team to the basket the foul the contact the finish No foul Give me that one Really be a heck of a year Theres so many good teams and so many good players uh that you can focus on Its going to be a great year Rob Lawson one for two from the line tonight five cheering points and seven assists That cheering rattles in And early on here are your best leagues with the Big 12 would been considered cheering recently the best league in college basketball Until last year of course the SEC had a bad year but the Big 12 back on top And there is the ACC right there with the Big 10 But what I like about the ACC this year is that from top to bottom there lot teams are now dont have a great pitch in the ACC So its going to be a really balanced state Heres J left open and the rebound up over everybody Eugene Alvin for Morgan State defensively State playing a lot better this first second half a Christian with confidence too I mean they didnt put the ball on the basket in the first half but this team is shooting with this kind of offense First three for Morgan State today with the season 10 basket at the rim on Eugene Well what Cals doing Roxy is theyre getting isolation and with no help and theyre just blowing by Theyre man oneonone basketball defensively as hard as they did in the basketball And I think Cals doing a good job of isolating They just below music his defender Help is late And then the foul takes place Now six from the line for Bell to lead all scores over 12 John Candon 11 for Cal Cal is 15 of 16 from the line tonight Well it seems like Chris Bell has had either of two things happen One is hes really dug deep and done some soulsearching about coming back out and playing and his coaching staff who we talked to today has talked about working with him and a little bit getting him some confidence but this has to come from yourself you got to step your game up and hes done that and he found himself sitting on the bench unfortunately quite a bit recently and he had a hearttohe heart about that and look basically told him make us keep you on the court and Chris the way hes playing a breather right now is making him keep it on the floor you know what Roxy thats not a music bad motivator the bench Bobby Knight said it there may be no greater motivator You dont have to yell at your guys You dont have to challenge them when somebody else is getting some playing time and youre not playing like you like to Uh they get you thinking a little bit and I think Chris Bell has stepped up to his credit And now Bell coming back Day Ames just picked up his fork Well theyre not happy They Martin Madson felt there was an elbow being thrown and they may take a look to see if there should be a call There was none on the floor Following play is under review per possible flagrant foul And that is Clarence Armstrong our lead referee tonight to see if it warrants a foul on Eugene Alvin for that swing right there Yeah Hes trying to clear out I dont know There was no contact So well see what happens He kind of waved at the air I dont think he was waving Lets see Well you know was blocked actually That was a pretty good defensive block by Day Dames D As got his hands up or he might have had some contact right there It looks like there may have been contact Yeah Well with his arm arm I mean hand waving into the arm So well see what the how they deem that Meanwhile Mark Madson is taking this opportunity Theres theres the play and I you know I dont know that it was directed at his head Had to review Theres no flagrant on the play All right So we play on Morgan State basketball Mark Manson took the opportunity to talk to his team regardless of any flagrant foul Uh hes challenging his team right now Wants him to continue to play the kind of defense they played in the first half But thats four fouls Now the the the bad news for the Bears is hes got four They look Eugene Alban definitely swung the arm I dont think its conclusive that there was contact and thats why there was no call made They look at one replay it looked like there may have been but you cant say it defensively and thats what you need to overturn the call and call a flavor cheering as Walter P Jr was able to get predicted foul there post now clean match up zone going to make the Morgan State barefoot knock down another three side five to shoot Alvin knocked away to steal Nolan Dorsy and we have a shot clock violation and its a turnover committed by Morgan State you got to love Nolan Dorsy how hard he plays hes really put in a great defensive effort hes everywhere look at that gets his hands in the passing lane and causes shot clock violation Calvers playing some good defense after the Mark Madson challenge and timeout Call it a timeout Speaking of challenge its very clear that Kevin brought us challenged his team at half Well and its paid off Theyve played Theyve had a great second half Carr fade away by car Rebound by Junior He got a decent shot Warel three short and the rebound car sees it for John Camden launches three You want to leave somebody over It better not be John Cam Hes been lethal every game the last three games down the stretch of these games Hes made every good shot 25 point lead for Cal Theyve led by as many as 27 Christian on a good night for Morton now Hes done a good job of taking what the defense and Jordans given him has given him that shot Hes knocked it down Didnt play last year because of the three Christian Theres confidence He just gets his feet set Hes got that picture perfect release hand straight up and down That ball just goes up the cylinder and knocks it down His shooting percentages Chris Bell youve got rare r where where uh time to find guys shooting an upper and quick 40 and three Thats pretty remarkable Alter Junior cheering short from deep wide open for goss another three short of the first one That one was long and Chris cheering Bell is home I love the pass ahead by Nolan Force He kept his head up found his teammate Chris Bell streaking to the basket Great job of kicking the ball ahead in the fast break transition basketball Largest lead for California and Bell leads the Bears with 19 Well you want to see some more John Camden No problem You get his feet set he is automatic Mr automatic from three He will just knock down shots And if you say that was music not lucky cuz Im going to do it again John Camman from deep He puts the bear up big and the music pass for the layup Chris Bell in still fans in a festive mood and holiday spirit Although Nolan Dorsy might have been cheering too overjoyed because he just got a tentacle in addition to personal foul cheering And uh applause according to one of our officials it was for some profane language Well he you know hes playing emotionally and thatll happen Roxy I think its you know you learn from this Uh you dont want that to happen but cheering hes playing so hard and hes playing aggressively Uh you cant measure success here But speaking of measuring Roxy stats dont always tell you the story of a game but how about the Cal Bear shooting 60 from the field 50 from three and 90 from the line and now they have to play without their best defender Dorsy will take a seat Hes got three fouls D City with four and actually back on the floor with the four Thats going to stay in that zone Theyve been successful match up out of it Now they go back try to get a man in their area Play on the short clock Play manto man David Buff Heres Kristen Oliver Has been a bright spot for Morgan State Hes made that shot work I mean that short corner step off and shot I mean hes shot it with confidence and hes buried it 14 for the Pasadena native play on the Hilltop Sunday against the Dons down LA TT Care exactly where he wanted to go navigated and got there TT Carr showing you what he can do hes been a bright spot for the Bears again in the absence of figures so far and a steel D to the racers and finishes on the second half But that was J That was sneaky Roxy He just laid the bait and went in there for the steel just kind of sat back and he had the largest lead for Town and the reverse falls out for Christian Depp by Milos E and looks for Chris Bell in transition go and what you want transition basketball How about this You got Carr coming in here off the switch He drives the bittings Thats exactly what youre supposed to do And you get the steel A laid back with the D and Chris Bell in transition rising high for two Second Christian perfect to the line Eight for eight 22 points for Bell tonight His fourth 20point game of the season Seven straight for Cal And the Golden Bears have the lead Cal is up by 32 Doing a good job pressing out again Pushing way out Pushing State outside the score area Corner three and a good look That wont go for David Buff and the rebound pin around Lu shot block foul and Lu will head to the foul line for Morgan State That was aggressive Lets go up Lets go first on TT Car Knock L 0 for one of the line tonight for the junior from Jacksonville out through the wall This just the second alltime meeting between Cali for you didnt coach the first play was way before you were it was Luke Campanelli November of 1991 that was the question year for Leamon Murray but Al Griggsby year before Jason offensive rebound and the reload heres Chris stop shooting Oh my You talk about heat check Oh deep in the corner Rocky Nothing but net 25 for Bell Hes out Lawson pull up jumper A nice move by Lawson 25 for Bell Two off a season high and 27 against Nice drop off by John will say he leaves in line Yeah you know Chris Bell has played with so much confidence Look at the shot page with a step back He wants the three Dont shoot a long two Turn it into a three and hes just feeling it Roxy I mean everythings going his way Hes playing with an extreme confidence Two shots for Elich who is just three for 11 from the line this year You know this reminds me of when Chris kind of broke it out and he did state there He had a tremendous second just almost you know a little more time I thought they might have got to state but this fell had a phenomenal game and hes had a number of games since then but recently been in a slump and as you mentioned now hes just hes come all the way out that slump off the serving the second team last year at North Carolina State and K 20 back up on the shot clock for Morgan State as Cal equal their largest lead of the night on a 122 run Theyre up 35 Good to see Nolan Dorsy back in the lineup Took a seat Now hes back out there I think hell play a little bit less vocally but hell play aggressively spinning underneath the Chris Bells the side of Christian meets great defensively cheering They really applause dialed in on that TT Carr weaves his way to the basket Hes grabbed and to me that should be a flavor because that is not a play on the ball No he grabbed a two hands around the waist and they may review this Lets take a look Yeah I just wrapped his arms around him That That should be a flagrant one Thats not Its not a basketball play No its not Here we are arguing about that in a 35point game First round pick a couple of years ago and Mark Madsons first year played here at Cal as TT Carr will go to the line to shoot a pair here Was a bad time I think was pretty good you know teammate Uh so its good to see him having some success Third great game for Carr in double fig straight start the Justin Hippone 21 for 22 Well number one theyre getting there Number two theyre measuring one of the leaders actually the leader in the ACC a year ago in both now 37 lead We saw the stinger there for the Bull coming up on Christmas Eve TT Carr with a steal and Carr looks to attack WHAT A MOVE BY CL T We talked to practice today and he told me how much he enjoyed being here being close to home his family coming out just getting this opportunity wanting to make the most of it He sure is Hes tied a young career high of 14 Hes made it look easy Rox I mean he looks like he belongs Theres no you know nothing abnormal but just look at the steel Watch his move Shake and bake by your defender Maybe even real foul You mentioned hockey earlier He put Rob Lawson on skates No he put him on a rollerblade skates You take your pick But Cals really stepped up their defense They just been one of their better defensive John pretty hard 162 run for Cal Coach Bras talked about Cal He said theyre the best team we played And he had a lot of respect for Cal Mark Manson He knows Mark Manson Hes coached against Coach Manson when they were he was back in Utah So their history goes back Chris Bell fires Season 2 for Chris Bell 30 against Louisville while he played for Syracuse plays like this is when the ACC opens up Somebodys going to be in trouble Theyre playing that also This is a beat down Theyre playing well Playing well Sundays rout It doesnt matter who youre playing or how youre playing Theyre playing hard on the baseline Plus one for Al J We were talking just it wasnt long ago where was one for 18 in the first half of three Uh its quite a departure from that afternoon because theyre putting the ball in the basket But thats a nice move right there as well to step through and the basket off the rim off the glass You know Kevin Bris is a veteran Roxy Hell bring his team back I think hell point out that Cal is a good team They played extremely well Theyll try to correct some things but but hes hes a teacher and hes a disciplinarian His teams have always won Hes always developed his team and hell get his team going once hes able to get all his players back Here we go TT cheering was supposed to get back on defense but he said You know what Im going to give it a crack at the offensive glass I mean the shot goes up Your job is to get back Car says You know what Im going to sneak in there for one Its my day And Im glad he made that cuz we had a rule If you went and crashed and they got burned you got in some trouble But he must have known something Careerhigh 17 for Car Well hes so aggressive Roxy And hes you know local product We talk about No Valley down the road Hes just an exciting player to watch Unselfish but he hustles everything And hes the first one out at practice last to lead He has seven assists with the 17 points jumper and Lawson will get to the one Yeah you get the feeling when you foul its the second You get the feeling Lawson will do more of that I think as season goes on youll see him take control Hes capable But Cals done a good job on him most of today Most of tonight cheering whos now four for seven from the line First appearance tonight for Montas coaches Hes in forage Well you alluded to it earlier I think well see some health guys come off the bench Butler BJ Mart you better start stretching Yeah but but you know and thats good to do Roxson Your first unit and first top guys are playing well You those guys deserve a shot And Cals really earned it tonight They played well John Camden lets fly three done I mean theyve just made every big shot They rotate the ball They played unselfishly Sometimes when you play with the lead you dont always play unselfish basketball Cam 20 points four for six from three Three is short for Eugene Alvin Here comes TT cheering Carr push attacks finds it again on the receiving guys in the opening area could have driven it Thats part of selfish basketball Youre the point guard Get your guys going He knows John Cam just hit a three and he got him another one Hed love to play with Carr 47 point lead Nice pass inside and the lane from A curling off the screen cheering Nice move by Alfred Borel Jr Capable scorer Hes a player who can make those moves Hes one of the guys have to play aggressively for long really talked about wanting to play with car Thats why we just get to the basket well find you nice to the bucket cheering and Chris Bell comes over to deny the tar 335 to go and Cal cruising to their best start in 65 years in every aspect of the game Yeah music you can see how dominant Cal has been I mean theyre just getting out in the passing lanes Theyre playing both ends of the floor defensively Theyre challenging Morgan State and theyre passing the ball ahead Very unselfish of getting assists Roxy thats really a good sign when your team music can score off of assist And so the Bears have really done that Look at their shooting percentage 62 from the floor 53 from three and oh a cool 95 from the line nine steals 18 assists It counts a plus 12 in rebounds Now Kevin has talked about his respect for how well Park Mad team has been playing Here comes day by himself underneath was reverses by the way coming underestimated his defender should have been an easy two and losing it was junior diving with Nolan Dorsy Id like to count how many times he gets on the floor from loose balls He and Petritus have to lead the team Dorsey for everybody tonight Yeah why not First points for Nolan Dorsy and his fourth made three 9749 off the wall and hell get to the line Its on camp free throws for the wall You know one thing I noticed Roxy when youre playing you can just look around This Cal team is really getting a lot of joy and excitement getting other guys going A lot of times you have a team thats you know youre kind of getting yourself going but you can see how how really uh much really attached these Cal players are to one another and how theyre rooting for each other cheering Thats a good sign if youre trying to build a program especially a winning program Youre going to need them First appearance for Dway sophomore from the South and also the first appearance for DJ Fisher the walk on for Camden and Bell Go after combining for a cool 48 Thats all combined 10 for 10 from the line and eight score 16 from I mean yeah eight for 12 from threepoint line Wow off his miscommunication program And heres the other thing Look you were able to benefit when you were coaching supervisor as many walks as you want but now the the roster limitations prevent you from having a deep roster So you got to keep guys that are in your rotation here in the ball game despite it being such a onesided game Well cuz you need reps And thats thats a good point You know day they really havent needed him Hes been probably their goto guy all year long you know Yeah Heres D doing a little bit of yoga right here Hes wa hes like I didnt know I could do that Well tough guy Hell bounce back He walked off Hes fine But you know again 8 am is kind of a quiet night but you dont notice it cuz everybody else has stepped up Hell be there Barbar the second in the game Great kid He worked hard too Heres cheering BJs cheering all over the place is a little something must have spilled and thats why we have a stop on play here with 133 to go Somebody wanted to get a sub I Ive seen that move before butlers now checking We wont accuse anybody of that If that did happen its a good team getting up cleaning it up or attempting to clean it up That must have been a big spillage over there I dont know But Roxy you know you cant say enough about this unit for Cal They performed tonight I dont care you know and it was just it happened to be Northern State They were on the wrong end of this But I dont care who they played tonight The way Cal played uh their opponent was a struggle And Kevin Bis is a veteran He knows that He knows how good Cal is And he talked to us about that He said This is a team music thats played extremely well They have they have a lot of respect for They arent playing without Elijah Davis who music is their top playmaker He and Lawson are a nice combination in the back court and Davis missing a second straight game You know averages 13 points music five assists a game was played at a little bit of a higher level but now playing at Morgan State So you are down him yet and Cals playing without Justin Pippen too So Cals really going into the season one of their strengths has been their def Thats been the key Theyve had multiple guys step up when guys were injured Everything is cleaned up over in the town bench area Guessing Fisher five to shoot Fisher and charge second or third We have never played distance So whoever took the ball out never got a shot Whoever got it in was probably going to get the shot Good Butler was open He should have shot it I know his dad would Okay I know Too many too many passes Dad was a heck of a player Dave absolutely Absolutely Dave and Stefans dad wasnt too bad either Washington down the contin Georgia Harris and the rebound Here comes coaches to bring it up Cal can just run out the clock now if they want Yeah saying dont shoot Yeah and thats classy I think the last time these two team played November of 1991 the final score was California 97 cheering Georgia State Well were going to have the same exact score applause Only hope you know that I was there Yeah probably remember Pretty good Okay All right So for the first time since Pete Newles last season when Cal went to the national championship game and lost to Ohio State the 1959 1960 team Cal is 11 and one The Golden Bears have won eight in a row Thats a great start And and again I dont care if people say What was your music schedule who you playing youre winning and youre building a winning culture and and youre playing basketball at this level when the shots are going in youre music getting assists and thats important I mean winning breeds winning And you want to get in the habit of
