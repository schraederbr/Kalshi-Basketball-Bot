is a guy that can definitely help him out a lot for him to be just a shooter he could focus on that and just becoming a score and I think thats when hes at his best and that is Day Day Ames the Kansas State transfer in the starting lineup today for Ron Sanchez taking on American which comes in with a record of six and five the Eagles have won five of their last six and they are a formidable foe out of the Patriot League pick number two behind Colgate in the preseason poll theres McNeely coming off off the screen well defended by Rogers America having really good activity on the ball got to get that b forced a tough shot up against the shot clock and its an empty trip to start the ball game for Virginia great start by Applause American so the Eagles are playing without Elijah Stevens their point guard still sidelined with a concussion took a shot to the face against George Washington he is making progress is here and was on the court before the game in uniform but not available for American in their Road blue uniforms with a white lettering red trim against his packline defense under five to shoot and this is typical Virginia basketball you have to be patient on this end of the floor for American to try to get the best shot every single time down the floor Jeff Sprout misses now for UVA McNeely got a look left it short Here Comes Colin Smalls they 62 grad Guard from Upper Marlboro Maryland finds Mayo trailing the play 43 met Mayo as the first bucket of the afternoon and that definitely can be something big for Americans their bids can shoot the ball at a high level and thats something that you can take advantage of a Virginia packline Defense and Mayo was on the Patriot League all rookie team a year ago when he averaged over eight per game and shot 42 from three you know he can do it hes under 30 coming in but hes playing a different role this year as a sophomore 100 and one thing coach has talked to us about they want him to be more aggressive they want him to go out there hes been willing to have him to take bad shots I wish I had that well a turnover for Virginia that has been a problem for The Who through the first 11 games of the year coming off a loss on Wednesday to Memphis 6462 led by nine at the half but there were good signs in that game for Virginia 1000 I think theres something they can take from that Memphis game that just show they can compete with anyone and this is a test for for them to just take care of business and be aggressive and finish this game but it is a zero some game you lose a ninepoint lead at halftime at home to anybody its a tough day for sure Matt Rogers the top Eagle misfires on his first attempt hes the preseason Patriot League Player of the Year averaging nearly 15 points and five rebounds a game Americas doing a really good job of putting pressure on Virginias guards and put a little as they can see probably watching that Memphis game that that bothers them a little bit so they saw the film and doing a good job as we speak Jacob Kofi top 16 recruit nationally with his first two points the who are on the board if he makes that next step Virginia can be on the way to a very good season uh in the ACC play 610 first year from Applause Seattle May little strong that time Kofi pulls down the rebound Applause Virginia is not going to change they are going to be patient at every moment but the difference is that they dont have that point guard that when the shot clock is late like weve seen so many times there was never any Panic not that they Panic now but you dont have the playmaker like you did over the last 10 years or so yes and thats what they looking for Day Day Ames to do and hes hes learning as he goes and I think as soon the more games he plays on this belt theyll be fine Greg Jones sophomore from Alexandria Virginia for three I mean like I said one of these one of the key things for them if they hit threes make this put the pressure on Virginia it could be very very scary Jones coming off a 19point performance in there great pass lost to St Joes last time McNeely off the pass fake buries the corner three thats what they need for him to do career 43 shooter I mean when he shoots the ball I feel like its going in every single time so they need to get as many touches they can for him American 6 Virginia 5 just over four minutes gone Sprout pass out in front of Applause Rogers well take a break for our first media time of the afternoon with the Eagles Up by One Youre the Only Kids on Campus its just a whole different feel especially knowing youre heading home shortly for sure and I think one of the good things well not good thing but they both saw coming off a loss so you want to go into the holiday break with the win so both of them have that opportunity here yeah both lost on Wednesday Virginia to Memphis here at jpj Rogers off the bounce still scoreless the San Diego State transfer Elijah Saunders skies for the rebound and theyre looking for him to make a big jump uh hes shown a lot of Promise the past couple games of being one of those guys that they can feature so he needs to get going for Virginia to play well throughout this rest of this season yeah his biggest scoring game so far near turnover deflected out of bounds off of mayo so Virginia will keep sers went for 19 at Florida earlier this month in the SEC ACC challenge but they feel like theres so much more to get from number two in white 100 he has the body type to get to the basket at any time so he needs to use it and be more aggressive L Fanon tane Murray has come off the UVA bench shot clock down to one and Murray gets the roll still hot aint he coming off his career high 14 points against Memphis Ron Sanchez said I want to keep in that role for now and see if we can just ride him coming off the bench looks like coach knows what hes talking about came in and hit his first Music Applause shot Lincoln ball number four for American has come in also Wyatt mes Rogers mishandles the pass it kicks out of bounds back to the Cavaliers this a great short roll from from Virginia and tame Murray just locked and loaded ready to play and I like his role right now hes very comfortable in that role and hes making shots so its only going to help Virginia Murray now four 13 on the year from threepoint land whos with the basketball on top by two Applause Americans switch it up to a soft two three Zone a into the paint great B puts it up and in that is what he is best at the lane and able to finish yes and thats what hes great at I mean thats one thing that he has to knack for but for them to take that next step if he can improve on his playmaking also it could take Virginia to that next level he will look forward to the break as well he had an ankle injury at SMU back in early December missed the bth cookman game Applause game nus puts up an airball that goes out of bounds untouched back to Virginia as you get set to ring in the New Year well have a mens basketball double header right here on accn that starts at 230 Eastern Notre Dame takes on Georgia Tech and then Cooper flag and number five du Coast Virginia Tech at Cameron indor we wish everyone a Happy New Year I was fortunate enough to be in Cameron Indoor Stadium for the first two games of the season for Duke and uh seeing Cooper flag in person is just as impressive as what weve all seen on television he really is something oh man hes the real deal I think I love his feel for the game I think thats what people need to try to understand with him hes not going to have the 25 35 points a game but he he plays the game the right way he plays winning basketball and thats what separates him from the from the rest and thats coming from atar heill saying nice things about a Blue Devil listen hurt me the whole time isan sha defense into the game turning it over again the whos hoping that DayDay ases becomes that 30 minute a game steadying presence making the right plays at the point hes on the bench right now roie is back in starting off the ball today but he will have the ball in his hands quite a lot American trying to establish Matt Rogers the 69 grad student into the Lane and Buchanan whistled for the foul with only five to shoot we had an interesting chat with Dwayne Simkins before the ball game about Matt Rogers and with the numbers he put up last year in the Patriot League he had opportunities had coaches from other schools at higher levels interested in trying to pay him a little money but that conversation I found very very interesting about why he stayed 100 um coach simpkin did a great job talking to him and let him know theres a lot that goes into this basketball game and having the one school that you can be a part of for a long period of time and Americas a really good school you know academically and uh he just has to play well against better competition if he wants to make that that next step and he agreed and he came back and hes improved this game and just wanted to work and be a part of a group for a long period of time and I think its is benefiting him greatly so he can just continue to do what he needs to do and improve and focus on the season and not worry about the outside noise he he hes going to do his job and I think hes doing a good job for that start this season oh what a marvelous career is his free throw snap an 80 Virginia run he is just the 15th in American program history with a th000 career points and 500 career rebounds now pushing 1500 points and well over 600 boards and you know if you want to play professionally overseas after this its good to put up those type of numbers as opposed to transferring up playing a much lesser role and having your numbers drop dramatically so that was kind of part of the thought process 100 I mean its not not bad being a preseason Player of the Year either no not at all well American along with Colgate Boston University they were the teams expected to compete for the Patriot league title this year Jeff sprous instant offense he is a threepoint specialist and a junior out of penro Pines Florida has his first three American back in front and thats a big time play I like what coach simpkin said theyre not going to slow down the pace former TJ power with his first too thats a great take by DJ hes not going to get much out of me though Im just play great take by DJ well they need for him not to just settle being a threepoint shooter right yeah I mean it just opens the floor for him if he could show that he could take the ball to the basket and finish also theyre going to play him for the drive and he can do a simple jab step and get his three off if he wants to two years ago Paul bardi had him number 32 in the ESPN 100 Smalls up against the shot block its another air ball violation B back to Virginia when we come back to John Paul Jones Arena American University is hanging in there against the ACC opponent shooting the three ball and right there with the whoos e Music Music they they fought back and they put made it a game and they had a chance to win the game at the end but just came up a little bit short yeah PJ Hagerty 21 of those 27 points came in the second half as the whoos fell by two to drop to six and5 overall 0 and one in ACC play they lost to SMU earlier this month in their loan conference game so far and after the Christmas break Virginia heads right into the teeth of the ACC schedule as you can see American watched a little bit of that second half of the Memphis game they went to a press to a late great defense by American now the shot clock violation this time at the other end of the floor American has come to play yeah and they theyre just picking up the pressure theyre making everything uncomfortable for Virginia making sure they know this going to be a game theyre going to have to fight for this win and I like it so far Julian eter number 32 for American University had a short run hes now being replaced by Matt Rogers ETB his father played at Clemson back in the 1990s against by the way Dwayne Simkins when uh Simpkins and the terrains were in the ACC my guy turb and thats a good rest you had the preseason Player of the Year sitting on the bench and you still only down one point so thats thats a good minutes from turbas and the smalls Miss goes out of bounds back to Virginia Sharma goes out McNeely returns so its McNeely roie Murray power and Jacob Kofi out there for Virginia facing a little fullcourt pressure from American and its good cuz regins seen this before at a high level against Memphis so now they know how to handle it they know teams are going to try to throw this at them to try to mess their offensive up because they are a good shooting team so theyre doing everything they can to disrupt them power goes to the left hand Rogers grabs the Applause rebound American is pushing early attack offense getting the ball side to side great pass heres Rogers double team go up there you go able to get his first bucket of the afternoon listen you did the guard did the work already go down there finish big fellow he is every bit of 69 out of St Maria geretti on Fast Break points the Eagles have six the whoos have none Ro a little short power active on the offensive glass you got to finish that possession youre playing at a high level you making them take a tough shot you got to box out and finish finish to play Murray to mcney drives on May power in the corner back out to tane Murray you work the ball like that and Theo somebodys going to be open t Murray is playing at a high level right now is very little but the relocation on that drive was very big for them uh for him to get that open shot and if you want to score you going to move it up the ball on the takeaway Here Comes power with numbers Murray with Kofi running a little interference the layup though missed Rogers and American coming back the other way this is Smalls tries to drive on Ro and Murray helps take the basketball away Murrays everywhere right now just pull Applause Laughter it great pass May another Power excuse me on the miss you know what weve seen out of tane Murray this year really is something something about being here for four years and playing a much lesser role until now but the growth he has shown has been something 100 as you establish yourself with a program you get more comfortable and you know where youre supposed to be you know how the the flow of the offense is and that is just that gives me PTSD trapping that post right there oh my goodness five on the shot clock sprous Way Off the Mark with a good close out by Murray Applause Virginia that P that but this play right here this relocation from Murray is so big time just creating space he sees his man help on the three on the drive and he just gets a wide open look and knocks it down hes playing at a high level right now they need it so hes come off the bench with six early points on a pair of Threes bench points eight for Virginia zero for American great close out Applause the best way to get attack a Zone get the ball in the middle of the zone so whoever can get that ball in the middle it opens up the whole floor or you can just do that shoot over the top mcne though missed it Blake you Canon with a nice offensive rebound get him a fresh 20 on the shot clock with under eight remaining in the first half the Canon sets the screen good hedge by etur Murray in a tough spot five on the timer McNeely driving into the lane Elijah Saunders Rises up great pull up great pull up great patience from Virginia not to panic just get to their spot and make a shot great play by Saunders and I was just about to say he needs to get involved in the game a little bit more too good to to just not be scoring but hopefully it gets going now turbet gives to may now into the immediate double team with Saunders skipped to the other side nois sow you can and Up Above the Rim for the rebound the whos by four with the basketball Applause Virginias going to have to get off that ball early on that Paul screen if theyre going to hedge that hard and then just create match up create Closeouts actually that would be tough for the uh American oh good shers takes the contact and hell have a chance for three well hes every bit of 68 240 he can take the contact inside as he just did great play timeout here is apj the Cavaliers have opened a sixpoint lead over the Eagles Music just to see what he can do they want him to be aggressive so they can take that next step and for him personally maybe he just needed to play a little bit more well often times when your role goes up your numbers go up as well as they should but he has certainly filled a role so far that Ron Sanchez and his staff look for him to UV has got its largest lead of the afternoon now thanks to an eight nothing run their second 80 run of the Applause game Collins Smalls draws the contact and a chance for three great take I think Colin Smalls can be very important for American because hes one of those guys that can touch the pain and make plays and he done a good job here against Day Day Ames and get to the back and using the left hand I see you young fella well hes another DMV guy when he was at James Madison Middle School he studied DMV greates like Marquel fultz melow Trimble Anthony Cowen trying to grow up to be like those guys hes now got over 800 career points in whats been a very good career at American University yeah he does a good job of making plays and when he scores he can put him he scores in bunches yeah he is their second leading scorer on the year averaging 12 1 12 points per game playing a bigger role today for the Eagles who are still without their point guard Elijah Stevens sideline still with a concussion but head coach Dwayne Simkins told us before the game hes making progress and it sounds like hell be back before too long for Applause American tane Murray has really put a imprint on this game in the corner yep get the ball to the middle Buchanan again with a shot clock great pass they count the basket as the shot clock was going off it looks like itll be a chance for three at the line for the Cavaliers and all that started from getting the ball to the middle of the of the zone and I think thats one thing that coach Williams he taught us from the get going theres a Zone get thrown at you get someone in the middle and that just opens the floor up for everyone else all right so I know coming back in here to John Paul Jones Arena as a tarheel is is bringing back some tough memories for you never won here Ive won in every other gym in the ACC this is the one gem I never got a got a dub so it definitely was tough walking in here it gave me a little PTSD when I walked in so whats it like for American right now facing the packline defense its tough you got to take what the defense gives you you got to be patient and thats the hardest part especially if you have a up paced team you want to play fast they dont want to play fast so its one of those things where you got to take what the defense gives you and just play really good basketball because theres not going to be many possessions for you so you got to take advantage and that always seems very much easier said done see thats another tough shot and thats what theyre going to make you do take a lot of tough shots and if you hit them youre going to have a good chance of good chance of beating Virginia but if you dont its going to get real tough and its even harder in here right a contested twopoint jump shot long two is exactly what youre looking to get for Virginia defensively 100 they looking for this go to be aggressive may hit a three early and has been quiet since just over 5 minutes remaining in the first half American down by seven Rogers working on VI cannon goes over the right shoulder with the step back cant get the roll Murray went flying but hes okay back up on his feet how do he get over there not sure I just saw him sliding along the Baseline I was like what happened he was all the way over to the bench very skip got to shoot it Jones cuts off the Baseline Applause young man out of quane Idaho Blake Buchanan misses on the jump hook I broke the backboard Jones gets a step on Saunders great finds Rogers in the paint for two great pass by Jones getting into the paint and dumping it off to boy Rogers on for a nice little floater great touch from the big man Jones is a sophomore from Alexandria Virginia McNeely with a tough spinning shot Rogers got a hand on the ball as the ball carrier dribbler was going by Jones thats a foul again I was about to say what Applause happened free throws when we come back with the Cavaliers up by five helped the turfs to a couple of sweet 16s in his playing days and now has worked his way up to his first head coaching job at American hes really excited about the recruiting class they have coming in next year in talking with him before the game today hes already thinking about retention you are constantly having to rerecruit your players even before theyre on campus the first time 100 and that has to be the hardest thing right there for uh a program like American no offense but its just it Its just tough because you know if they play well other schools are going to try to come take them from and you just have to rerecruit and understand its a process to this thing and continue to build with the school that believed in them first I think that that means something for Virginia Elijah Saunders has scored their last eight points roie puts up an airball plucked out of the air and put back in by Jacob Kofi Big Time rebound from Jacob they have they have to oppose their will on the inside and if they continue to do that theyd be okay but Kofi continues to show signs they need that freshman to continually grow yes I mean hes huge for this team because at the end of the day they they need size and he can dominate on the inside and he shows promise and the more of his growth hes only a fresh so he has a lot of room to grow yeah he was the 2024 Washington Gatorade player of the year for eastside Catholic School in samamish Washington the suburbs of Seattle theres some of that size and physicality unable to finish though Saunders when I see Saunders I kind of see like a grant Williams you see that a little bit Yeah former Tennessee Applause AllAmerican same body type there you go May there you go kid so hes got a couple of Threes off the setup from Jones you you could really tell he has the feel of the game he just has to be aggressive and and Trust his work and I think the more games that he plays the more hes understand hes a top of the sky report and theres a reason for it cuz he can play the more he does that and hes guarding the best play on the other team mcne from the Baseline for two my fa may I dont mean to do that I Jinx Applause you well may is from a terrific Sports family his mom Alex played at St Josephs helping the Hawks to four NCA tournaments his sister Katie also played for the Hawks his father Mark Mayo was a quarterback at Boston College and you may have heard of his Uncle Mike who also played at BC played in the NFL has had a long and distinguished broadcasting career Matt Rogers now with eight points hes been steady to help keep the Eagles close back to within two yeah hes asking for a sub right now but hes playing really well on both ends of the floor he his footwork is really well down really good down low so he needs to keep doing that so that he can keep them in his game in that bay well his season high was 26 points at Sienna back in November theres a foul call theyre going to get Jones for a reach Applause inou 23 tough right there great Music activity ACC PM with Mark Packer and Taylor tabom weekdays at 4 Eastern right here on accn and the ESPN app were here at John Paul Jones Arena those girls are dreaming perhaps of Santa Claus coming in a few days enjoying little Hoops its one thing about college basketball in the holidays it can bring families together fathers and daughters whether youre rooting for American University or four for the Virginia Cavaliers were so glad youre with us here along with Theo Pinson Im duck Sherman DayDay am knocks down the three and his evolving role is going to be a conversation piece as Virginia gets ready to move in fulltime to ACC play 100 and the thing about Virginia theyre theyre not in Champion National Championship mode right now theyre a young group so theyre able to build with this crew that they have right now and the more he gets better and my boy inter Bay with the Music Applause Tracy hes came in and played well gave him really good minutes as Matt has gone out the game so Americas playing really good basketball right now great pass McNeely spotting up sprous was right there with him good activity by Buchanan to get out of the basketball and the foul is going to be called against Lincoln ball hey hey you can see not many fouls in whats been a fast moving first half just the fourth foul against American only three team fouls called against Virginia now Rogers will come back in with 33 seconds remaining in the half tane Murray comes off the Virginia bench and will replace ases I would be very interested to see Rogers in a turbet in the game at the same time to put Rogers at the four with a bigger lineup with Virginia they have in there cuz I think you would like Rogers to be matched up with Saunders Saunders able to get where he wants in the paint you see what Im Applause saying he Applause timeout American calls the timeout after the Saunders bucket gives him 10 points in the ball game and willll take a break as well back to jpj in 30 seconds Hill doggo is is a dog she is on both ends of the floor both ends of the floor She is the goods she is a joy to watch see what America comes out here with little stack action foul given by ro Sprouts trying to tell the officials he was in the act of shooting but that was obviously preplan by Dwayne Simkins since theyve got fouls to give and they will likely continue to do that its a great call stop see what they were trying to run mess up their out of timeout play now lets see what American bounces back with Rogers under 10 and the half pass to sprout trying to create space into the corner Smalls no two seconds 1 second the heave by roie is no good and that is the end of the first half a competitive but at the end of the day I think one thing that Virginia needs to do also is get Isaac manely more in this game a little bit give him some more looks and continue to forth feed him a little bit to get his rhythm going and weve kept our eye on DayDay ases the Kansas State transfer point guard for Virginia back in the starting lineup again now trying to defend the post against Rogers Saunders Saunders has the double team DayDay in that first half no no assists in the first half but no turnovers what do you make of his first 20 minutes I think theyre pretty solid I think he didnt force anything he didnt go out there and make any ilevi shots he went in and let the game present itself but he still has to get in that assist column to be the starting point guard Andrew roie gets the ball back former St Thomas Tommy tough shot rolls off the rim Jones The Rebound Here Comes American trying to push the tempo when possible May along the Baseline for the slam great drive better to attack his feet on the close out get to the rim put on his head I mentioned all the family connections athletically in the first half of M I forgot about his older brother who spent four years as a righthanded pitcher at the University of Connecticut but you see some of the athletic ability he has here along the Baseline and thats what they want from him they want him to continue to be aggressive and for him to continue to have confidence playing Loy and scoring against this tough Virginia team is only going to help him in the long run and going into conference play well again last year averaged 86 per game shot it very well as a patriot League all rookie team member hasnt shot it as well this year as a sophomore bad pass McNeely turns it over to ball great pass one more extra pass Jones from the corner no and you can live with that thats good basketball and you can live with that every single Applause day roie back outside mcne fouled by Jones yeah Virginia needs a good possession here Americas came out out with a lot of intensity and you could just tell theyre in a different they want this game really bad and Virginia has to match that intensity well after this game American will bust back to Washington DC and then the guys will head their separate ways to go home for a few days for the holidays Saunders on the Alley top floor Elijah Saunders give him the ball great underneath out of bounds play from Virginia get saers rolling into the rim for a l nice feed by roie back to a fourpoint lead Saunders leads everybody been very efficient as you see five out of six from the floor Lincoln ball inside to Rogers had good position on Buchanan and then he commits a I guess frustration foul just wrapped him up yeah that was for sure a frustration foul he was like Im already here I might as well finish it off with just make sure they know Im fouling him but great underneath out of bounds play my goodness was his head at The Rim pretty close so where do you see him in his role going forward this year what does Virginia need from Elijah Saunders now averaging 10 and a half points five rebounds should those numbers go up they definitely should I think he has the capabilities to do it because he can score at all three levels he can go on the post he can make midrange shots he can shoot the three like I said he reminds me of Grant Williams if he can do a little bit of what Grant did while he was at Tennessee he can hopefully be in the lead one day roie forcing his way into the lane left it short great take great kick ahead Colin Smalls working the point for American which is playing with Elijah Stevens again with the concussion suffered against George Washington and without him the Eagles are back within a point very rare transition defense for Virginia so Im glad its good to see American capitalize that in transition Americas energy Americas energy out of out of the halftime break has really well the Eagles putting up a fight here at John Paul Jones Arena the welcome back to ACC Network basketball presented by Food Lion an American has come out to play here in the second half back to within a point of Virginia at 3433 we got the timeout from Coach Ron Sanchez after another example of ineffective transition defense yes American has 10 transition points but only two points off a turnover that means Virginias scoring and theyre still getting fast rate points so thats a problem on Virginias end so they need to pick that up in intensity as you can see the bench is been involved on the American side they they want this game really bad and Virginia just has to match their intensity and theyre playing hard on both ends of the floor so Virginias in trouble good hands by bald to knock it away from Saunders heres May with it American with a chance to retake the lead they led by as many as four early and have hung around Virginia the whos had a couple of 80 runs in the first half but American has never gone away the personal goes against Blake view Canon the first of the second half against Virginia the key for American you you keep this thing around a sixpoint game going into the seven minute Mark you put game pressure on Virginia to make plays and I think thats what their goal should be and theyre doing a good job right now wide open Smalls American retakes the lead thats a great underneath out of bounds play a little pick to Picker Virginia needs a bucket here and thats the GU to go to and he obliges Isaac mcne now with eight points it comes down to the point that Isaac has to be a little bit more selfish he has to force the issue a little bit more because he is the guy for them and for them to be successful as we talked about the start of the game they need him to play well so he has to be a little bit more aggressive May on the back cut oh swing it Smalls okay never mind dont listen or shoot the three dont listen to me hes feeling it now with 12 points go ahead then my guy coming a good game right now I told you be aggressive MC cant answer Smalls rips the rebound and the grad student from Upper Marlboro Maryland starts the offense he has reached his season average with the 12 points a guy like Colin Smalls you dont want him to get a rhythm cuz he can score in bunches like I said before over 800 career points Applause here goes Smalls tough shot aim stayed with him with a good close out thats great defense hand to hand is not a foul tane Murray had a couple of threepoint shots early hes been quiet since Off the Bench now for UVA 10 on the time Americas defense is really good Kofi now Virginia had a lot of opportunities on that play with a lot of open Cutters but they couldnt see him cuz Americas doing a lot of great pressure on the Applause basketball little Flex action Smalls Rises up off the front rim if he hit that one Virginia would have been in trouble see what the Virginia comes up with on this Applause possession well American certainly has gotten Virginias Applause attention ases down the lane missed the layup well during practices especially we were talking before the game with associate head coach Jason willerford what are some of the things theyre trying to do with DayDay aims to mold his game to what they need theyre trying to give him extra points in practice for passing the ball not to say he cant pass the ball but they just trying to emphasize to him that when he makes plays for his teammates its only going to open it up for him on the offens end a lot more and I think theyre just trying to preach that to them and uh see if it works for him big to shot mayah up against the buzzer hes into double figures the lead is back to four Americas energy right now is on a different level and Virginia is just not matching it right now and the crowds getting into it trying to push Virginia on a little bit great relocation Murray does a great job great job relocating on that shot so youll live with that shot these guys are tired they are gassing for air right now but Americans they got to ride this wave right now and make team to make this run Wyatt nedes feeds ball on the low block they go back into ball with Saunders defending back outside Smalls blocked a got a piece of that shot theyre exhausted out here we missed the whole Music timeout going to see whos going to capitalize with both teams being tired whos more in Applause shape mcney calls for the screen rejects it now tries to penetrate picked up his dribble good back cut Saunders able to save the pass to Kofi three to shoot Saunders no American can stretch the lead Virginias not making many advantages on their offensive end right now theyre not creating any advantage on the offensive end and for them to do that they need to move set solid screens so people can get open Virginia has not scored in over four minutes missing their last five shots from the floor oh he said lets have this dance oh Lord double dribble cant do that indeed well that will take us to a much needed break everybody can catch their breath but for americ theyre just creating great shots and Smalls just hitting a lot of tough ones early uh thats a great underneath out of bounds play a little pick to Picker there but listen like I said before you have to hit threes in an atmosphere like this on especially on a packline defense like Virginia you knock down threes you have a chance to win the game and theyre doing that right now so they just got to keep it up Smalls has nine of his 12 points in the second half he and may has scored all of the American points since the intermission and as we talked about earlier about Virginia they have had a number of games like this one this year where one half does not mirror the other they have come out flat here in the second half 100 I think thats something they definitely have to address um they they cant have this LW in the second half because this is winning time now and they have to figure that out because right now Americas not playing theyre coming out to win the game to go into the break with a W you can see the scoreless drought for Virginia pushing in 5 minutes uhoh hes open McNeely probing along the Baseline Sharma swings it out to Saunders three to shoot Ros got to let it fly got it a huge shot for Virginia huge shot for Virginia and roie he was offer into that bucket right there so hopefully that can get him going and get Virginia going also back to a onepoint game Adrien Samuels is coming to the game for America former Vanderbilt Commodore hes number 10 in blue working the Baseline he clears out so they can send it inside to Matt Rogers the Patriot League Player of the Year in the preseason Samuels no Here Comes Ro Virginia with a chance to retake the lead America has that lineup in at turb and Rogers like I talked about in the first half now roie again is able to get to where he wants but hasnt been able to finish over over the smaller Defender 100 sometimes when you get to the basket that easy you kind of relax a little bit he has to continue to be strong once he gets down there and just finish the shot he can get to whatever point he wants theres a smaller guard on him again he averaged 17 points per game as a freshman at St Thomas but that scoring has not translated for the most part since transferring to the ACC but he hits a big three his first points of the afternoon moments ago to pull the Cavaliers back within one of the Eagles and hes a former Virginia player but he has brought pieces of other stops back to Charlottesville and has played a big role in a program that six years ago won the National Title 1 unbelievable person I think that tells how Jay will is hes a great dude and been a friend of mine since I played him when I was in Carolina now I do a lot of games with Cory Alexander the former Virginia player and teammate of Jay Willie I know him as Jay Willie cuz I never hear anything but Jay Willie yeah from CA but he has been a fixture around these parts and now the associate head coach under Ron Sanchez Mayo misses and now Virginia after a fiveminute drought with a chance to retake the Applause lead Ro and Kofi along with Sharma Saunders and this is McNeely Kofi into the lane the double team and had it blocked but fouled by etur and so uh Virginia will have freee throws UPC coming which they have not very had very many of today the only guy whos gone to the line so far today for UVA has been Elijah Saunders great play from Virginia coming out the timeout they know Americas putting to him the ball pretty aggressively as you get set to ring in the New Year well have a mens basketball double header right here on accn that starts at 230 Eastern Notre Dame takes on Georgia Tech and then Cooper flag and number five Duke host Virginia Tech at Cameron indor we wish everyone a Happy New Year one more great slip shoot Applause it against the double team nice ball movement Saunders goes inside for two thats good Ball moving from Virginia thats a big time possession for them so do you go back to what you said when they were swinging on the perimeter should ERS has still shot or is that layup better the layup was better cuz he made it but he definitely had to take that shot he did the defense gave you the answer so you got to do your work and just knock that shot down but he scored that was our ninth lead change weve yet to have a tie since 0 May tough shot and the Eagles are back in front I think this is exactly exactly why coach Simpkins to wants him to be aggressive cuz he is that good and hes capable of making big time shots like that so he has to continue to be aggressive for them to win this game and to do well in conference play McNeely no long rebound comes to May whos every bit of six s with guard skills just a sophomore out of Berwin Pennsylvania I dont mind that shot from McNeely has to continue to be aggressive eter hands it off lets give my man ET turb a touch or he shoot it from out front Jeff Sprouse his second made three of the ball game and this is Americans largest lead of the day how many threes is that now nine Americas putting a lot of game pressure on Virginia right now Kofi back out to roie under eight minutes remaining in regulation Virginia in some trouble great take Ro with the left hand May clears and dribbles up for American oh Lord hey may is playing hes playing loose right now oh left his feet y didnt have anybody to find and so its a traveling violation cant do that well youve been counting the threes right from the start Theo they are piling up and thats the way for a patriot League team thats the recipe to take down an ACC team and the Eagles so far have had the right recipe American has hit the note they have hit 10 threes and they put game pressure on Virginia and Americans threes they have hit a season High 13 threes against George Washington and this is the third time this year with 10 or more threes in a game so theyre on the right track to make a big time upset here and Paul John Paul Jones jpj sorry I was wondering what that play was they just ran coming out of the timeout Virginia trying to get a good shot McNeely got a good look and buried the three from the wing he has to continue to be aggressive and thats the guy you need to go to Great out of timeout play from Virginia to get mely a great shot hes got the 11 Saunders with 14 to lead the Music Applause whoos great play Rogers little strong Sharma has the rebound Virginia down by two with a chance to tie or retake the lead Kofi doesnt even look at The Rim slip get out that he does now picks and Pops feeds inside to Saunders Smalls got his hand on it he wants for a review y this is not the NBA no not the last two minutes so itll stay with Virginia along the Baseline its so funny how kids in college do that now yes like we we dont have that rule yet not to the last two tane Murray back into the game for Virginia and a half to go in regulation good move kof with the denial on the perimeter by Jones he realized I got to make a play and he sure enough did that he might need to get some more touches the way that looked hes aage been a 610 232 our first tie of the ball game crowds getting into it a little bit great pick and pop from an American Rogers no theres the Freshman from the Seattle area with a big rebound America probably needs about three more threes to go down for them to really have a chance to put more pressure on them Murray goes strong on the back door Virginia back in front crowds into it quick timeout Co the loudest jpj has been this afternoon with the who back on top a Music for the Cavaliers its a 70 run to erase a fivepoint deficit yeah big time plays from Virginia great way to respond off American punch him in the mouth Big Time play from here from Kofi getting to the Lane finishing with the left showing a lot of athleticism there then with the great CL and a great finish talking a little bit okay yeah Murray has got some game that we have not seen his first three years here in Charlottesville yeah getting a taste of it lately for sure as you know hes comfortable he talking a little bit behind it and they go to Rogers their best player first team all Patriot League tough Runner gets the whistle and he will head to the line well American got out of that possession out of the timeout what coach Simpkins was looking for established number 15 inside and the foul called against Kofi thats a great its a great security blanket having the preseason play of the year of the for American on your team just give him the ball let him go to work one of the great players in the history of this program well starting December 29th well have four consecutive weeks with Sunday womens basketball quadruple headers right here on acc Network our first lineup has the great Hannah Hidalgo and third ranked Notre Dame hosting Virginia at new Eastern then its Louisville BC followed by Carolina Miami and capped off by NC State hosting Clemson shout out to my lady heels we got a tie game pressure broken Murray will wait for Music McNeely give it to him clear it out Saunders faces up puts it on the deck loses the handle and here comes Rogers with a full head of steam throwing it no not throwing it down lay it up over the rim what do we call that I dont know but he looks over at the American bench with little sheepish grin yeah that was that was Applause nasty now well call it two points and American back in front took the lead its all that matters Ro great pass VI Cannon oh got to finish that Jones ball and sprous around the perimeter for American along with Smalls and Applause Music Rogers catch and shoot sprous no Buchanan picks the rebound got to get a good shot here need to find mcney Ro into the lane tells Buchanan not to follow me in here space the floor now theyll try to reset 4 minutes left in the second half oh wow going to the deck McNeely was fouled and hell be shooting free throws when we come back all right Theo what are we going to call this thing on the Breakaway non dunk ah I dont got it Im tired well just call it two points yeah lets get it lets count it not much I can say to that well McNeely at the line after being filed in the act of shooting his first trip to the stripe the who have only shot now five free throws and theyve missed three of them another part of that recipe if youre American looking to pull this sort of upset youve got to make your threes you need a little bit of help from Virginia and so far the uh the Cavaliers have been helping in various ways Another Empty trip for UVA American gets the basketball yeah I think the best free throw shooter for Virginia missing two free throws defin a help now mcne on the year 76 you cant go 0 for two there roie now going to be called for the foul trying to deny the inbound to Jeff Sprout just the third team foul against Virginia the second against roie very interest to see what this out of timeout play is cuz this is huge started the third 3 minute timeout now its winning time lets see what they do Smalls and Sprout bring it up against the Virginia pressure heres Applause Music May oh my goodness what a play wide open Music now great play youre okay with that if youre American under four minutes left in Applause regulation roie off the crossover a nice Rhythm twopoint jump shot huge bucket that that possession was a little stagnant but he bailed him out tied once again now 51 a piece under the thre minute Mark oh look though Rogers crosscourt Pass wide open Smalls now takes it to the deck missed the reverse layup Virginia basketball the way Smalls has been shooting it I thought he was going to take that three thats exactly what I was about to tell you definitely have to take that shot I mean Rogers did all the work now you got to help him out and make knock down that three Kofi from the head of the key trying to find Saunders nice gather boy he takes up a lot of space inside carves up nicely good soft hands its a great sealing underneath Big Time play for Virginia now they got to do come down here and get a stop the whoos after their drought have now made five of their last six to retake the lead Smalls with the basketball just over two minutes to go sprous and they go to Rogers lost it on the way up it trickles off the rim to Virginia theres a lot going on down there yeah Kofi and Rogers got tangled Rogers to get back and it leads to a wide open three by T Murray huge shot he had 14 last time outs against Memphis Murray Off the Bench with 11 so far this afternoon the biggest one makes it a fivepoint Virginia lead yeah tough possession uh you had Rogers fall down on the other end of the court so they had numbers on the other end get to the middle kick it out for three Murray does the rest Kofi kept playing great recognition that the wide open shooter was in the corner its a 7 nothing Virginia run Saunders playing a really nice game on both ends of the floor this afternoon just didnt take the shot but uh its a big possession here to put a little bit more game pressure on Virginia and as the game has gone back and forth Virginia has heated up the last couple of minutes for coach sanche as American is cooled off missing six of its last seven Ro trying to keep the ball out of the hands of Jeff Sprouse hes got it now in the front Court oh God him same they got the shot they wanted theres a foul underneath on the rebound great play they ran the same play out of the last timeout got the same result those are not whos coming from the stands those are booze because the foul goes against the Freshman Jacob Kofi look at the bottom of your screen can you imagine if he made that that be a huge swing crowd just saw what you saw on the Jumbo Tron theyre not Music convinced plenty of time on the shot clock Jones foued by S great take great take you had Kofi outside on the threepoint line so thats the time thats the time to attack the basket and try to get to the Music paint great job Jones yeah excuse me first foul on Saunders the fifth against Virginia here in the second half and now Jones the sophomore from Alexandria Virginia 87 on the year coming in you see two for two this afternoon perfect rotation make it three for three Big Time shot Big Time shot got to make this one make this possession a little bit more tough for Virginia there you go I like it lets see how each team executes mcne gets it into roie back to McNeely the Junior from Poco West Virginia along with roie bring it up Smalls pokes it away roie to his knees trying to save it and this is way where for Virginia over the last several years you could give the ball to a point guard and not worry about it but to try and get into their offense now less than a minute six on the shot clock its been a struggle for the whoos Kofi no Americans got the basketball not a good possession from Virginia Ros holding this back I would attack him right here Rogers swings another the Doubles coming another the Doubles coming American has missed its last five threepoint shots and they turn it over sprous lost it in the paint and now Virginia in the drivers seat up by three with possession definitely probably should have took the shot took the floater in that situation always want to go with a bounce pass once you get that deep into the paint but great play from Virginia so now for the Eagles go for the steel but if you dont get it youve got to commit the foul and its on the reach in against Lincoln ball his third and now the seventh and so now Virginias just got to start making its free throws yeah it comes down to that they make their free throws they can get out of here with a win I definitely would have tried to trap their first to see if I can create a turnover before Applause Music elij so now Elijah Saunders 81 on the year coming Applause in big free throw to make it a two possession game huge free throw here I would think American doesnt take a timeout here they want to go fast and try to get a good look early and then from there you foul or go from there the youngster from Phoenix Arizona just two off his career high four for four from the line a couple of clutch free throws there Americans got a hurry down by five sprous is fouled by roie and just the 16 foul so the foul to give brings us a timeout called by Ron Sanchez acpm with Mark Packer and Taylor tanom weekdays May the trigger on the sideline and to Smalls quick release for three theyve missed their last six threepointers and youve been tracking it Theo all game long they were hitting them until a point and now theyve cooled off and down by five yeah I think thats one of the thing that kept them in the game and I said to keep them in the game they needed 10 threes and then once it got to that 4minute Mark they needed three more and theyve had three good looks at threes that they wish they could have went down but I think the three that Smalls passed up in that corner when Rogers had in the post and skipped it to him that kind of hindered him because if he takes that shot with confidence he might have hit those last two shout out to Virginia on there defense yeah Virginias got the right guy at the free throw line in Elijah Saunders hes had a big game big game 19 points a career high for Saunders Mayo from the corner its good American Still Applause Alive a clock issue perhaps thats a free timeout for Applause American smart by Virginia to get the ball into Saunders who will head back to the free throw line fourth foul on Jones and so the long walk back to the other end of the floor for the 6A Junior out of Sunny Slope High School in Phoenix Arizona he had 19 earlier this month in Gainesville against the Gators and can surpass that here right now with a couple of big free throws maybe they should have went to Applause May two huge free throws for Saunders sprous misses Maya quickly back out for a twopoint shot thats good by Jones with 1 second on the clock ball inbounds to Music Applause Murray and so Roger erors says the game is not over they will put some time back on the Music clock well it was 1 second on the inbound so any timing issue five 6 somewhere in there perhaps cuz the foul was pretty much immediate yeah I would say six and so Roger SS is over determining when that foul was given five point4 all that to be said Murray hits one free throw its over after a VI of the game clock will be reset to point 6 UVA has two shots so there you go chance to catch and shoot if youre American but like you said if Murray makes even one that would become academic Applause tell you what the senior from Auckland New Zealand has become a piece for this Virginia team yeah hes played a really good game really good two games actually 14 last time out against Memphis 13 here this afternoon and despite a game effort from American University Virginia heads into the Christmas break with a 6358 win big time win for Virginia uh finishing this game is
