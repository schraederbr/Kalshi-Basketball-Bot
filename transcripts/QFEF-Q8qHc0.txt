two Blue Devils If theyre not physical their schemes are not going to matter Ready for the tip of this sonic blockbuster and underway with the Blue Devils getting the first possession of the night Duke 27 and three Theyve won seven in a row and they have just overwhelmed those seven teams Pass tipped away Seion James gets it back to Cooper Flag and still 11 on the shot clock Duke was trying to post RJ Davis with Seion James right away and Davis just knocked the ball away Really fought James Canipple with three on the shot clock Gets a tough shot off and hits He is one cool customer Khan Canipple He does not back down The starting five includes the three players honored on senior night RJ Davis Jaylen Withers and Ty Claude First and only year to Carolina His fourth school was with Georgia Tech last year Hell get the start and be in there for a couple of minutes What a block by Elliot Cado denying Tyrese Proctor RJ Davis gets trapped Gave the ball up but Elliot Cado with a chase down What a spectacular block by the dimminionive point guard for North Carolina Gdau all of 61 with a an incredibly impressive defensive play and Cooper flag bounces down a shot Its a long two the officials are saying and well have to wait until they check on that Two of the officials were kind of motioning at one another I believe it has been recorded as a long two Kadau with a malawatch on him Drives left hand up and good and Carolinas on the board Boy what a gutsy drive by Elliot Kado Had Malawatch on him at 72 because of the switch and took him on scoring with that left hand Malawatch back to Proctor Missed a game last week with a knee injury Returned Monday against Wake Flag open again This one wont go and its down to Withers But Jaylen Withers has been outstanding his last six games and he really needs to rebound in this game Carolina winners of six in a row averaging over or about 91 points per game in those six Withers a good cut but he couldnt handle the bounce pass Elliot Kdau cannot turn the ball over in this game Thats his 102nd turnover on the year And he had five of them in the first meeting against the Blue Devils And now John Gaffne one of the officials is going over to the scorers table Heres where flag was when he took the shot and that is clearly a three So I would imagine I saw John Gaffne talking to the scores table Maybe theyll look at that at the under 16 timeout but it looks like Duke will have a point added to its total And I think you can expect that Duke is going to try to go after RJ Davis and Elliot Kadau whenever they can try to post them and use their size Duke with such positional size one through five Their guards James and Proctor much much bigger than the than Kado and Davis for the Tarheels Yeah bigger and longer Boy good screen by Van Allen Luben And Kado kind of turned it into more of a floater than a jump shot and left it a little bit short And so many of Dukes rebounders can take the ball and just go They dont even need to outlet it Like flag off the glass No down to Cadau Carolina needs to get out in transition in this game They Duke wants to make them a halfcourt team Another turnover Just trying to make the home run pass Duke in transition James up and good with the left hand and the lead is up to five There is no way after a turnover you can set your defense You are just allowing a run out and there is no way to guard that And in the first game Carolina turned it over 14 times That in and of itself isnt a terrible number but 10 of them were live ball turnovers and the Blue Devils turned those into 19 points Well the game was over at halftime so whatever happened in the second half really didnt matter Gdau draws a crowd The kick to Drake Powell and the freshman knocks down a three Drake Powell has been a different player the last couple games Hes now 10 of his last 13 field goals Hubert Davis has tinkered with his starting lineup at times this year and Ben Allen Luben in there now Didnt start because its senior night but him and Withers a bigger combo up front So Powell playing a little bit more on the wing than he was earlier this year Ball is still loose still live and out of bounds to Carolina Carolina much more physical to start this game than they were in Durham when Duke blew them out John Shier third year as the head coach at his alma mater Won an ACC tournament championship two years ago Took them to the Elite 8 last year Obviously aspirations to win it all This year outright regular season title ACC tournament title a national championship And Duke is certainly good enough to compete for all of those Thats over the top of the backboard And over to Duke Hubert Davis in the fourth year as head coach at his alma mater Of course took them to the national championship game in his first year Its really been an up and down ride Jay for four years You know preseason number one dont make the tournament Eight seed get all the way to the national championship game Every year has been a completely different story for this Tarheel program Yeah last season ACC champions Good steal by Drake Powell and the fans loving the effort on defense by Powell in the Char Heels Well Pal did a great job of getting down in a stance and timing out that dribble then going for it with both hands to knock it away Just really good defense by Powell whos now playing his natural position He was having to play some small ball four but now that Jaylen Withers has emerged that allows him to move back to the three where he can use his size and hes much more effective and more comfortable A couple of subs for the Tarheels Seth Trimble and Ian Jackson have both checked into the game Jackson has been shooting the ball at an incredible rate recently 17 for 28 from three during this North Carolina sixgame winning streak Heres the switch again Malawatch on Davis How old the pull up and hes fouled by Flag 411 into this one in an enormously important game for the North Carolina Tarheelss And if you dont believe me look at Coach Davis fired up During the timeout scored a threepoint field goal so an extra point for the Blue Devils now leading eight to five Greg Powell is at the line You know yesterday Hubert Davis talked a little bit about RJ Davis Hubert was an assistant coach and the lead recruiter bringing Davis in here and he told us at practice yesterday Ive actually known him like seven years And Hubert whos a very sentimental guy he got he got a little bit choked up talking about the relationship that hes had with Davis over the years Hes trying to get an extra year of eligibility He doesnt want to let him go and I dont blame him Yeah he was looking for loopholes left right and center yesterday Lets go to Jess for more Yeah Dan RJ told me I can remember vividly the summer going into my senior year and I was playing at a team camp at Archbishop Malloy Coach Davis was sitting on the wooden bleachers on the right side of the court had glasses on because he likes to be camouflaged But he knew from that very first conversation that this was going to be the right place It was just so genuine and it just speaks to the type of person Hubert Davis is and the coach that he is Jess thank you The loud booing is that Drake Powell was just called for a foul The crowd saw the turnover and maybe thought if anything maybe flag fouled him after the fact Another Duke turnover though and Carolina has been aggressive at the defensive end Well this is a different Carolina team that weve seen over the last six games into this one Much more aggressive assertive and an attack mode Its a hit first mentality Trimble misses the three and the rebound to Seion James A fouryear starter at T Lane came off the bench the first month or so has turned into a starter and a very important part of this team And he drives and hits and has a chance for three I watched James play at two lane I thought he was really good but I didnt know he was this good Hes just had an outstanding year taking over at the point Although Duke has a number of different players that initiate offense starting with Cooper Flag but his strength his athleticism his length and hes such a good defender and really takes great care of the ball John Sher speaks glowingly about the transfers the veterans that he brought in Seion James from Tain Mason Gillis from Purdue and Malik Brown from Syracuse who is back after missing the last four games with a shoulder injury Brown is back and on the floor as we speak Brown a defensive savant has great hands leads this team in deflections and thats with missing several games with that shoulder Hes on Davis who buries a three Thats the one thing you cannot do with RJ Davis is give him space That little step back he can get that shot off Youve got to make him put it on the deck and get him inside the line and score tough twos rather than open threes Carolina doing all the little things better Hubert Davis says as Duke turns it over again Fourth turnover for John Shs team already Duke Duke trying to play with a little pace turning it over and John Shy after that turnover just holds his palms down saying calm down Long way to go Again this is a Duke program because its been a down year for the ACC They have not been tested very much at all in conference play They are 181 The only loss coming last month at Clemson and the other two losses neutral court losses way back in the nonconference to Kentucky and Kansas Canipple gets rid of it quickly and knocks down a three Well you make any mistake on a switch and Khan Canipple is going to make you pay When hes able to shoot it from the catch spot without forcing him to dribble he is money What a year hes had John Shy admits more of a facilitator than he intended or expected A good score as well A projected lottery pick So much talk about Cooper Flag but K and rightly so But Kibbles had a great season He has had a great season but just a a defensive mistake on this cut They called a switch Seth Trimble called it and RJ Davis just couldnt get there in time And off the switch Malik Brown on RJ Davis had his hands down and Davis is too good of a shooter And hes nine of 15 from three in his last three games coming into this one You give him an open look hes going to drill it Yeah hasnt shot the ball as well over all this year as last year or the year before But as Jay said really heating up what it matters the most as Trimble now at the line for the Tarheelss For your point on RJ Davis this year hes faced so many bigger defenders Hes only 6 feet tall and last year Carolina was throwing the ball inside to Armando Bacott They could play more inside out which theyre getting back to Theyre doing a better job of that right now But its a lot more difficult this season for RJ Davis to find those open shots The free throws for Trimble and its a twopoint game Well look at the pressure on the ball Carolina has really ratcheted up the pressure early on in this game Canipple again and gets the bounce Itll be a three for Canipple and the Blue Devils are back up by five Boy one step late by Ian Jackson and just gives up that open three again Shooting it from the catch spot Youd have to force him to dribble it Caniple already with eight Boy Davis wanted the step back three Reathers Powell takes a bump Trimble cant get it off from the corner and its six on the shot clock Turn around and nobody on the glass for the heels But good help by Malik Brown there to stop that initial drive A foul on Cooper flag and thatll be number two on him Thats because of the ball pressure North Carolina is getting into the ball They are impacting the ball and Drake Powell right on Cooper flag He wanted him off him so he just used that off arm for the discard right in front of the official Easy call So with 1253 to go in the first half Cooper Flag goes to the bench with his second foul And you can see a pretty easy call there for John Applause Gaffne Carolina running action in the middle of the floor to try to eliminate some of the weak side help Jackson on the drive and the freshman lays it in What a beautiful play Just driving past Malawatch and getting past Isaiah Evans and using the basket to shield the shot block And the way hes shooting it now too What a dangerous scoreer he is in so many different ways as Proctor quiets the crowd by knocking down a three Duke has so many weapons so many different guys that can knock down a three and about as efficient an offense as youre going to see Davis with a foot on the line and misses the long jumper The rebound to Evans Caniple just keeps going and lays it in and hes got 10 Just a beautiful hesitation move And thats another example of whomever gets the rebound You know that was a quick outlet but there are so many different guys that can bring the ball up and initiate That makes it really difficult to stop Duke in transition Canipple had a great first game against Carolina back at Cameron 22 points and five assists Jackson will put it up and hit Its a three for Jackson Over his last six Ian Jackson is shooting 61 from three 17 of 28 before he knocked that down Thats big Music time Proctor No tip Yes for Malawatch Malawatch that high ball screen was rejected That allowed Malawatch to just get to the offensive glass easily And Trimble pushing it down the court draws the foul and will be at the free throw line when we come back Up and down they go here Jay with Duke now leading by seven Well Coniples knocked down a couple of threes and then Tyrese Proctor just his second game back from that injury rejects the ball screen knocks it down He is a solid player in quad one Thats not the only thing that the committee looks at but it sure jumps off the screen when you look at it And a win here tonight would be very very big for Hubert Davis and his program Yeah it would go a long way But right now Duke is shooting 69 of the field They have from the field They have nine turnovers but theyve got eight points in the paint five second chance points to North Carolina zero And theyve scored six points off Carolinas turnovers Carolina has not capitalized off of Dukes turnovers Theyve made four of their five threepointers so far tonight James he is so strong How you going to keep him out of the lane Well Duke is trying to operate in the middle of the floor They havent run much side pick and roll action because North Carolina likes to ice it They want to keep it to a side So you probably wont see a lot of side pick and roll from Duke throughout the game GDO back into the game at the point coming off a 12 assist effort at Virginia Tech during the week Withers whos also been shooting it very well lately for the Heels misses the three Boy that knee looks fine for Proctor When he went out of the game um just last week against Florida State it looked like it might be serious but he came back quickly and looks totally like himself His first game back against Wake Forest he had 12 and looked pretty good just had to knock the rust off Pulls up for the jumper and hits It has been scored a two on the floor right now Must have had a toe on the line but its the biggest lead of the night right now for the Blue Devils Well Carolinas going to have to keep up the pressure on Duke They really didnt get into the ball on that last possession Jaylen Washington takes a bump and finishes Jaylen Washington is more of a short roll big Just a step up screen and then caught that and went right over Malawatch to get that righthanded finish That was very nice by Jaylen Washington James using the screen kicks it to Proctor Good recovery by Ian Jackson but he cant give up middle and Proctor lays it in But when you close out you have got to keep the ball handler out of the middle Take away the shot They have to be mindful of giving up middle drives Proctor the junior from Sydney Australia averaging almost 12 a game This high ball screen gets Malawatch away from the basket Trimble with a drive Hangs He wanted the foul call No whistle And back come the Blue Applause Devils Little split action off getting it to Malawatch up top Proctor What a move Cant finish it He wanted a foul call and it looks like he will get it Its going on Ian Jackson And thatll be number two on Jackson Just a late contest on a very difficult shot when you just caught him on the elbow but you just want to put pressure on that shot Thats a really tough two And heres the what looked like a three from Tyrese Proctor And again they can look at that at the under eight timeout We imagine that they will So two on Jackson Hes going to come out as RJ Davis will come back in for Carolina And those are the kind of fouls Dan you just cant pick up I mean Jackson and the Carolina defense did a good job of forcing a really tough two a fadeaway jumper You cant bail out that jump shooter Make him make the tough two and Proctor drains them both This Duke basketball team is such an efficient offensive team Yeah per CBB analytics they are second in the nation in offensive efficiency and second in the nation in defensive efficiency The only program to be in the top five in each category Applause Withers into the paint Tough shot and the rebound for Isaiah Evans And there have been few offensive rebounds for North Carolina to start this game Dukes got all five guys getting the defensive glass When Evans comes in he is in there to knock down threes That is his specialty And yet another foul on a jump shooter Well Isaiah Evans his last five games hes 19 of 39 from threepoint range Thats just under 50 And then Elliot Cado tries to fly by but just clips him on the hip to pick up that foul Number two on Kado So Flags got two for Duke Jackson and Kadau each with two for Carolina But what a weapon Isaiah Evans is as a freshman to be able to bring into the game I mean you remember those six threes he hit in the first half against Auburn but hes had a number of games especially of late where hes hit multiple threes shooting 46 from three over his last six Had five against Miami recently five against Virginia and averaging better than 15 points per game in his last Applause five And his range you dont want to say unlimited but its pretty close Applause And Duke continues to extend the lead 70 run and a 14point lead North Carolinas got to look to get the ball inside Not necessarily for a post up but they got to get back to getting into the paint and putting some more pressure on this Duke defense but theyre switching and it is tough to drive some of these switches Withers got a pretty good look cant get it to go And again its down to Duke Wii Withers can hit that Hes a good shooter but I think North Carolina settling for some shots when they can put more pressure on the defense by driving it more often And this ones going the other way Its on Malik Brown His first A timeout on the Done a fabulous job And he has integrated transfers into the culture Theyve been spectacular but what hes done in his three years uh has been nothing short of remarkable And thus far in the game Dan Dukes game plan is going exactly as they would have hoped Theyve taken North Carolina out of transition and theyve made the Tarheelss into a halfcourt team and theyre dominating the glass Duke has 10 rebounds in this game Theyve got two offensive rebounds They havent missed many shots I mean heck theyre 12 of 16 so its tough to get shots And theyve added 10 now make it eight points to their lead since Cooper Flag went to the bench with two fouls with 1253 to go That was Withers with the layin for the Heels And thats what North Carolina needs to do more of Theyve got to attack the paint Patrick Gunga into the game with Malik Brown sitting with his second And North Carolinas only got two rebounds in this game The nipple No Tipped into the hands of Davis The pullup three goes And when you tip the ball back out you may think youre tipping it to a teammate but you can also start Carolinas transition Thats really the first transition basket North Carolinas had in this game And its gone from 15 to 10 since the last time out Good ball pressure by Trimble The nipple into traffic The kick to Gillis Got it That is a great pass and a terrific job by Mason Gillis of positioning himself in the corner where Canipple could see him got in the passers vision Boy can helps you win in a lot of different ways at both ends of the floor John Shy when we asked him about him before the game the first thing he talked about was getting all the 5050 balls He wins every battle I cant recall a pair of freshman like Cooper Flag and Kenipo being this savvy of knowing how to play at that age And North Carolina youd have to go back to Tyler Hansfro maybe Antoine Jameson but theyve just got an elevated awareness of how to play the game drawing three defenders kicking it out to the opposite corner Mason Gillis the transfer from Purdue who shot well over 40 from three last year playing off Zack Edy knocks down the open corner three and really we saw it from day one Canipple was their leading scoreer in the first two games of the season A flag was very good early had some turnover issues a little bit in the Kentucky and the Kansas games but has turned into maybe the player of the year I mean from day one both of these freshman have shown that they were everything they were hyped up to be and maybe even a little bit more than that Yeah And Conanipple I think has shown to be far more than his reputation suggested He was a top 30 player coming out of high school but hes far better than he was projected We will see if John Sh will leave Flag on the bench for the rest of the half Went out with foul number two with 1253 to go But Dukes still got a double digit lead but good pass ahead Good hands by Davis Still Duke Bull Davis has got speed but the recovery to get around in front and then knock the ball away with the right hand That was excellent defense by RJ Applause Davis Junga looking for somebody to give the ball to Itll be Canipple for the ball movement Duke going side to side The ball movements excellent Good hands by Powell Proctor still got it Couldnt hit it And its Carolina ball Davis in to end And the rebound down to Proctor Now Duke looking to run Canipple and it is still Duke ball as Cooper Flag is now reentering the game Missed about 7 and 12 minutes and Duke went from up five to up 11 while he was on the bench You know some coaches like to keep a starter on the bench with two fouls until the second half but I think John Shy believes why play the best possible defense on your best player by having him on the bench Take the risk Still belongs to the Blue Devils Like Drake Pal is a good defender Hes got size length athleticism and playing the three puts him with better matchups He was at a matchup disadvantage when he had to play small ball four Withers and Van Allen Luben the two big guys front court players who start and are in the game right now for Carolina Flag the pull up No And Withers comes down for the rebound A nice job by Drake Powell of switching out to challenge that shot Withers goes by Malawatch scoops it up and in and its down to single digits The ball is moving better for North Carolina in the last several possessions and theyre getting drives and getting to the Applause rim James out of bounds Still Duke Bull Terrific back cut by Seion James But heres Withers when he catches it just with that left hand drive getting back to the right hand just going right by Kaman Malawatch and then Cooper Flag didnt want to pick up that third Applause foul Flag trying to drive on Withers The pull up will go How much game does he have And hes not he doesnt turn the ball over his last six games 30 assists three turnovers Im not good at math but thats 10 to1 assist to turnover ratio Thats amazing What a player of the year race A wooden award race it has been By the way Janai Broom scored 34 today for Auburn Although it was Alabama winning at Auburn in overtime on a runner by Mark Sears as time expired But broom flag who you got Its like it changes every day Oh I thought Van Allen Luben was right there to tip that ball in Thought he got fouled Tipped out Here comes Trimble going at Flag and the follow by Luben Smart play by Trimble to go right at flag Force him to foul you or back Music off Boy Van Allen Lubens been playing well for the Tarheelss Last five better than 13 points per game Almost seven rebounds per game And its Carolina ball again Now Carolinas getting out in transition Thats where theyre dangerous Powell for three and flagged down with the rebound for the Blue Devils A pretty good look for Drake Powell whos shooting 40 on the season from threepoint range Boy this is an important last three and 12 minutes for North Carolina Can they cut into this lead or can Duke extend it Flag the drive and an offensive foul It is number three on Cooper Flag Withers was standing there for a long time Surprised that Cooper Flag didnt pull up That is a huge play by Jaylen Withers Cooper Flag Jaylen Wi Withers was right there and set Really surprised that Cooper Flag took that chance with two fouls It would be just their second quad one win of the season A win they desperately need to boost their resume They appear to be squarely on the bubble Maybe on the wrong side of it heading into this game tonight Into Luben Got his man in the air Hits and is fouled North Carolina going with that middle ball screen And once they got the switch Ben Allen Luben did a great job of stopping to post Tyrese Proctor on the high side And that watch how he post right here That gave him a little extra room And then Seion James couldnt get to him if he went all the way to the rim that would have been closed off Really smart play on that role by Van Allen Luben Hes kind of been an underrated or under publicized part of this recent winning streak for the Tarheels We told you the numbers his last five games Hes just a bluecollar lunch pale kind of guy He works hard Hes often undersized compared to the guys hes covering but hes been really productive lately for Carolina Well hes going to the glass and hes done a good job on the offensive glass He had a double double against Virginia Tech 19 against Miami Hes been a threat out there The nipple Another great look He finds Gillis who cant hit it and its down to Luben and Carolina can get even closer after not grabbing any rebounds early Carolinas now getting on the glass and now they can put Duke on their heels a little bit defensively Jackson back into the game into the corner to Withers and a good decision to reset Carolina stopped turning the ball over Davis Another three for RJ Applause Davis What a player That was as difficult a shot as youre going to see in this game 11 now for Davis At one point Duke led by 15 Its down to three And a steal by Withers The Heels are running again Davis Applause again Its a 100 run for Carolina Its a onepoint game here at the Dean Dome Music Applause Music Music Well theres a reason why RJ Davis is the third leading scorer in ACC history As tough a shot as youre going to get And a terrific job by Ben Alen Luben of disrupting that lob with Kaman Malawatch And then RJ Davis a little hesitation And thats how you take the ball to the basket He went right into the chest of Khan Canipple Knocked him back and completed the play Right now North Carolina fired up because they have closed the gap and they have done it Dan defensively Theyve gotten into the ball Theyve impacted the ball and all five Tarheelss are getting on the defensive glass Thats allowing them to run If they win theyll be the four seed going into the ACC tournament If they lose theyll be the five Either way they would have a couple of chances there to pick up good wins But again as weve mentioned on a few occasions this game is enormously important to the Tarheelss postseason chances And the question is where does Duke go for offense right now with Cooper Flag on the bench with three fouls and Treble a foul out near half court his first foul you live with because Hubert Davis wants his defenders to get into the ball pressure on the ball and physicality throughout the course of a possession Lag sitting with three fouls Hes played nine minutes in this game Five points and a couple of rebounds James driving draws the foul and is heading to the line Looked like it was on RJ Davis but there were a number of Tarheelss swarming to the ball Just a strong drive by Seion James and RJ Davis just goes right across his arms as hes in his upward motion Championship Sunday tomorrow when the womens game day crew will be at the well in Greenville South Carolina at noon Eastern to get you set for all the title games coming up highlighted by three of them on ESPN The ACC championship begins at 1 Eastern Itll be NC State and Duke then the SEC and then the Philips 66 Big 12 title as well What an afternoon of championship womens hoops action Carolinas had some success with this high ball screen Getting the switch with Malawatch Now theyre going to double Withers is open Luben tried to keep it alive but Amalawatch brings it down for Duke Oh Malawatch is 72 He went up with two hands to secure that rebound The ball screen by Malawatch to free up Proctor The long rebound to Trimble Well that was a wideopen shot with Carolina in drop coverage and a reset now with Davis Got Gillis on Applause him Lots of time on the shot clock Davis the drive the pull up hits again I think he liked that matchup going against Mason Gillis just backed him up got to the middle of the lane pulled up a little bit of a fadeaway and RJ Davis is on fire in this first Applause half 5 seconds between the game clock and the shot clock Boy great job by Drake Powell to deny Khan Canipple James no Balaw watch No Carolina can get a last look Davis It will not go as an up and down first half comes to a close Put him in some screening action Get a switch and then go after him Nearly a turnover on the first possession Proctor boy used that left arm to shield off Powell and knock down the shot And Pal still with a good rear view challenge but Proctor really kept his eyes on the basket and concentrated through the defense Limited minutes in the first half for Elliot Kadau because of a couple of fouls Elliot Cadau had a couple turnovers early Carolina only had three turnovers in the first half All of them in the first three minutes Davis Wow Again what a night he is having in the last game he will play in this building And Proctor was right on him That little step back and knocked down a huge three It is all tied up at 45 Now Carolina with the switch Ben Allen Luben now on Proctor and RJ Davis on flag Its stolen away Withers wide open and Carolina has its first lead of the night Boy Withers ran the baseline Malawatch lost him Proctor couldnt get to him Flag will get the roll to bring Duke back within one Cooper Flag is so skilled and athletic Move to that left hand Hes just a big time player And as Duke fans well know hes been an extraordinary second half player in games this year A tough turnaround for Drake Powell A great individual move just planting that pivot foot and then pivoting for the fadeaway jumper Carolina top locking with Seion James in the corner forcing him to the other side Tipped away by Cadau Applause Davis Another one A twopointer for Davis And its a fivepoint lead Oh this is vintage RJ Davis Vintage Applause Five great years for RJ Davis as a Tarheel and looking to go out on top in this one Jay And he is seeing a big basket knocking down tough shot after tough shot 15 points in the first half He has been a oneman wrecking crew for North Carolina 20 points in the ball game for North Carolina has done a great job in this game of forcing turnovers 11 Duke turnovers in this game only three North Carolina turnovers and the Heels had not missed a shot in the second half Flag going to work on Withers right hand drive then getting back to that left hand just the skill and the strength and Jaylen Withers is a good defender and sizewise can match up with Flag but as Schubert Davis said yesterday he goes hey Flags a generational player and a lot of coaches around America have learned that this year Luben in and out and Amalawatch rips it down and thats the first shot by either team missed in this second half Canipple to Malawatch got it back kicks it out and Flag is fouled by Withers Cooper Flag has done a much better job in the second half of the season of straight line driving Hes much more assertive and decisive where earlier in the season you might have seen him take multiple dribbles then spin maybe get in a little bit of trouble That was just a straight line drive and then his ability to move that ball to the left hand and finish off the glass Thats just next level into a flag in the corner Tough one Wont go And its down to Withers Excellent defense by Jaylen Wii Withers to stay in front Force the fade away Dukes won seven in a row Carolina six in a row How about the English from Kado past Malawatch What a finish by Elliot Kado with the left hand Flag with Powell on him right now Sets the screen to try to free up Proctor That puts Kado on flag Caniple rises up for a three Rebound Powell The heels running and Powell is fouled on the play by Seion James And the momentum continues for Carolina here early in this second half Anytime Elliot Cado drives you want to make him finish rather than spray it out to open threepoint shooters but turns down the ball screen Malawatch forces him to finish And Elliot Kado accepts the challenge with the left majoring in English Lost to Alabama lost to Florida They scheduled hard They just didnt win any of the big games Their best win their only quad one win is a neutral court win in December against UCLA Obviously a win here tonight would be extremely meaningful Well if this team had been playing all those games they would have won a number of them North Carolinas a different team right now than they were a month ago And turnovers have been the difference in this game 11 turnovers Theres a short roll Luben the challenge by Flag but Luben scores anyway Well hes operated so effectively in the last month out of that short roll going right into the chest of Cooper Flag on the vertical contest Proctor at the other end Proctor is such a good cutter Hes more than just a catch and shoot guy That was his reputation coming into the year but hes had a fantastic season Brown switches on to Davis That puts some real size on RJ Davis Ian Jackson looking to get going Too strong on the three Flagged down with a rebound Proctor swings it Deflected away by Trimble And Hubert Davis looking around from one official to the other saying Wheres the whistle Yeah the official said it was incidental contact that both of them were going after the ball Not sure I would agree with that I think that Trimble had the open path to it and Canipple got in his Applause way Yuber Davis pleading his case with one of the officials The no call gives it back to Duke But thats the sort of defensive intensity that North Carolina has had and needs to maintain Canipple nice look James the finish Boy off that screening action RJ Davis just got picked off a little bit and lost his balance And Canipple able to turn the corner again The switch Brown onto Davis They need to look inside to Ven Allen Luben He needs to post hard against Tyrese Proctor Jackson fouled on the drive Han Canipple coming off some screening action on the left side of the floor and RJ Davis just gets knocked a little bit by Malik Brown That allowed him to turn the corner got the help up and Seion James with a nice baseline cut to get the easy dunk Number three on Malik Brown He will stay No sign of any subs coming in for Duke as Ian Jackson the tremendously talented freshman from the Bronx averaging 13 and a half per game Couple of subs for the Heels as Luben and Davis go out or the way he and Jackson has scored over the last six games Its been impressive Almost 60 from the field overall over 60 from three Seven games prior he shot around 20 Carolina as a team in this sixgame winning streak has been one of the best offensive teams in the nation Proctor got it taken away by Kado Carolina so much more physical in this game than they were earlier in the season Really impacting the ball Smaller lineup right now Washington at the five and in effect Powell at the four Applause Trimble Whoa Flag got all of that And James runs it down for Duke But Trimble really wanted to take on that matchup but Flag his timing and length impressive Brown does not look to shoot very often Swings it to Canipple Offensive foul Elliot Kadau has been a pest just stayed on the high side of Canipple on that drive forcing him baseline and Canipple put a little bit too much into it with that right arm but just staying right on him and then Canipple with a little push and Kadau goes flying Offensive foul Jay thats the 13th turnover charge to do Carolinas only got three and as you know they had those three in the first four or five minutes of the game Almost turned it over right there Nowhere to go for Kado Back out to Jackson The crossover on Proctor The step back and the rebound to Canipple Carolina trying to make individual offensive plays the last couple of times down They need to move the ball in order to move the defense and then attack it Flag not there And Washington down with a onehanded rebound Flag settled there against Kado Jackson will drive and finish Applause Well you settle for a jump shot and Carolina takes it the other way for a terrific euro step layup by Ian Jackson Powell guarding flag on this trip Off to James Muscles it up and in Boy terrific pass off that little screen roll with Seion James rolling to the basket hard Hes up to 14 right now for the Blue Devils The nipple switches on to Kado behind the back The force and its off the side of the backboard That is not what Carolina wants It gets Duke out in transition and Flag flushes it Flag into double figures running a little double drag and then the part of thats a ghost but Carolinas got to start moving the ball Dukes defense has been set with these switches No RJ Davis been on the bench about the last 2 and 12 minutes Powell a step back three Just too many tough shots Flag behind the back and a block is the call on Seth Trimble And itll be Cooper flag at the line when we return Hes been playing this entire second half with three fouls Jay but hes heating up Yeah the great pass And when you try to block that shot that opened up the offensive glass for Cooper Flag with the two hand slam After tonight this will be his last game with Duke He is flying to Miami Hell have his opening press conference Monday He and John Shy talked as John told us before the game and Shy said to Lucas Hey its not fair to keep you here Id love to keep you here but youre taking that job and you got to go In this era of NIL and transferring you theres an immediacy about being with your new team And Miami season ended today Theyre not even going to the ACC tournament So this will be the last time that Jay Lucas is on the Duke bench Yeah People think its about the March 24th opening of the transfer portal but its really about when seasons end And Miami season has ended Duke seasons going to continue to go on And its important for Jay Lucas to learn what he has and what he can keep at Miami right now What a pass But off the fingertips of Luben out of bounds And thats the first turnover in forever committed by Carolina Early in the first half they had three Thats the first one since And Duke now back looking for the lead And Caleb Foster Jay into the game for the first time tonight for Duke Good back cut Brown A beautiful feed to Caniple And Duke leads Boy not enough pressure on the ball to take away vision from Malik Brown Just a terrific back cut by Khan Canppel RJ Davis back into the game for Carolina Brown on him out on the perimeter Davis has been scorching hot recently and turns it over again So backto back possessions where the Heels turn it over Foster got it Boy smart play to attack the basket there Its so difficult when Malik Brown has switched out on RJ Davis Youve got the size the length the defensive ability and Malik Brown can stay in front and make it really difficult to angle out RJ Davis got the switch again When it was Malawatch Davis was able to take that on and score Withers defended by Canipple Withers goes right at him Tipped away by Foster And its Duke ball now Duke with an advantage Withers behind the play James Brown the trailer and its a 120 run for Duke And now its Hubert Davis who needs a timeout Give credit to the defense of Malik Brown on RJ Davis when he switched off floor with just a step and go back cut and a terrific pass right past the ear of Seth Trimble And then when Malik Brown has switched out on RJ Davis just able to angle him away from the basket down the lane line that got Duke out in transition and Caleb Foster just inserted into the game Goes right at the basket and then Malik Brown right down the lane after the Seion James pass Duke with a big run to retake the lead A game of runs and its the Blue Devils on a 120 run right now Brown back after missing the last four games with a shoulder injury As you mentioned Foster just into the game Its been a tough year for Caleb Foster He was the starter at the beginning of the season Did not play at all Monday night against Wake but John Sh inserting him for the first time just a couple of minutes ago and hes already made a couple of very good plays North Carolinas got to move the ball from side to side get a little more action because they have not made the Duke defense move much Theyve just really tried to attack a set defense Little screen for the screener action after the slice cut Had too much dribbling not enough passing Jackson to Luben and the tough finish to snap that 120 run Duke wasnt able to get pressure on Ian Jackson Then the steal now from RJ Davis Boy Carolina needed to get a couple stops Davis oneonone with Canipple Step back Not this time Luben though has the rebound Cant finish it And Fosterss got it for Duke Brown a good passer Hes got three assists in this game Hes going to take a three and hit it Wow After the back cut by Canipple that drew two defenders left Malik Brown wide open And he is not known as a scorer Doesnt hit many threes Just his third made threepointer this season Now in 10 attempts he gambled That left Davis open And Duke catches a break that Davis misses a clean look A terrific back cut here by Khan Canipo comes up and then watch he gets a little screen and then goes back door draws two defenders and Vin Allen Luben just late getting to Malik Brown He didnt think he was going to shoot it but he did Good minutes for Brown in his return Boy especially defensively What a difference maker He goes to the bench Malawatch back in Davis guarded by Foster Hes had success taking on Malawatch at times Good pass fake Withers has it blocked by Flag Boy Flag went a long way into the corner to get that one as we now have exactly 8 minutes left in regulation Duke has gone back out in front A sevenpoint lead here in Chapel Hill This got Carolina back into this game He was as hot He was the hottest guy in the building Has cooled off a little bit recently What do they need to get it going offensively again They need to start moving the ball more Carolinas been making a lot of individual plays North Carolinas got 22 field goals in this game Only five assists and that assist total has to go up with a little better ball movement and player movement Shot clocks at three Davis gets it off Tipped by Malawatch and gathered in by Malawatch And Duke has the ball on a 152 run That was a short clock but yet another difficult shot for North Carolina and for RJ Davis Again Duke statistically one of the best defensive teams in the nation this year Flag No flag again Carolina ball Seion James with his size and strength guarding RJ Davis Now hes got Malawatch on him He can take this one on Hes sending Withers to the corner Kicks it to Kado and Kado hits a three But Khan Kipple was shading toward RJ Davis Wasnt as worried about Elliot Kadau And Kado was very confident off that catch and shoot That was a huge bucket for North Carolina 30 threepoint shooter on the season Does not often look for that shot Flag swings it to Canipple Kadau went flying and is slow to get up as Canipple knocks down the shot There was a little fade screen from Kaman Malawatch on that skip pass to Canipple from Cooper Flag Gdau swings it Withers is open Back to Kado Withers baseline The scoop no good and its Duke Bull Well youre better off just passing that It was a good shot fake and drive to get Cooper flag off balance but just a reckless finish at the basket Carolina trying to stay within range Down by seven Duke really trying to spread out this Carolina defense and drive it What a drive by Canipple to make it a ninepoint game Hes got 17 But Duke has had an answer for everything in this second half The Nipple now with 39 points in the two games against the Tarheelss Feels like a huge possession here for Carolina The crossover by Davis Kadau What a pass What a block Flag got it Luben couldnt finish it Cooper Flag with his third block of the night A bucket saving block from Cooper Flag At times can be as big a factor in a game defensively as he is offensively Oh he is definitely a twoway player Foster it bounces out to a wideopen flag and the rebound down to Cado Davis in heavy traffic Gdau soft off the glass but it wont go James what a finish The change of direction in the open court by Seion James getting past RJ Davis and going to the other side of the basket to avoid the Powell block And Duke is back out to a doubledigit lead after Carolina had roared back late in the first and into the second to lead by as many as seven This is a versatile defensive team that Duke has They can switch guard multiple positions but Van Allen Luben looked like an easy bucket but saved with the left hand block by Cooper Flag and he let everybody know about it And then Seion James in transition does such a good job at changing direction twice then gets around RJ Davis and takes it to the other side of the basket to avoid Drake Powells block shot I dont I dont really know whats going on Applause Gdau blocked by Foster and then Brown tried to save it but threw it out of bounds But again a good contribution by Caleb Foster Did not play at all Monday against Wake Didnt enter this game until about four or five minutes ago but has made some very good plays Yeah that was a terrific play by Foster But give credit again to Malik Brown His presence defensively has been stifling for North Carolinas offense in this second half Applause Davis trying to get free Looked like he was going to get a back screen Instead came off a little down screen from Ben Allen Luben And the foul committed by Tyrese Proctor his second Dukes defense their help side has been really well positioned You know they communicate very well but their position is basically their help They dont have to help and recover Theyre in helpside position already So its just a oneway recovery when a pass is made 10 on the shot clock Flag on Kadau Now Davis The switch the drive the kick and the three for Seth Trimble Carolina had to have that one What a shot by Seth Trimble on the catch and shoot from the corner over Canipple So Kado and Trimble each have hit big threes in recent possessions for the Tarheelss but they are still down by eight Flag bumped Now Foster with seven to shoot Brown will try another one and hit again Two threes here in the second half for Malik Brown Well you think Duke missed Malik Brown while he was out with that shoulder injury His presence has been felt on both ends of the floor He has doubled his threepoint total in this game Had two on the season coming in Duke was talking to Malik Brown earlier in the season When youre open shoot it And he has started to listen And its working out pretty well for Malik Brown the transfer from Syracuse known as a defensive specialist Now hes a threepoint threat knocking down his second three of the ball game without Music hesitation one seed Louisville would be the two Clemson the three and Wake Forest would be the four seed meaning they would also get the double buy A Duke win over Carolina here tonight Carolina would be the five seed RJ Davis has not scored in this game since the first couple minutes of the second half Dukes switching and their size have been really difficult And the size a factor there and then a run out and a chance for three for Tyrese Proctor Boy after the block shot Cooper Flag taking it right down the middle of the floor in transition Proctor running the right side Just an easy basket Seth Trimble with Cooper flag behind him just taking it right out of his hands That started Dukes fast break And Duke shooting 65 in this second half North Carolina just 37 And a very balanced effort at the offensive end for the Blue Devils Proctor at the line Misses the free throw Hes got 16 as does Cion James Coniple 17 Cooper Flag 13 Brown switching off on Davis yet again cuz his size is such a difficult challenge for RJ Davis at just 6 feet tall Luben fouled on the floor by Seion James Itll be the 15 foul committed by the Blue Devils this half Number three on James Boy just 238 remaining in regulation and nowhere near the one and one You know the the number one thing John Sh wanted tonight was a win obviously but do you think its good that Duke really got pushed They have been blowing everybody out in the ACC the last few weeks Is it good for them to get a push like this heading into the postseason Yeah thats really the only question mark about Duke is when they get into a close game how will they react because they havent been in many close games in ACC play Theyve been with the exception of their game against Clemson theyve been blowing everybody away Theyre on a sevengame winning streak and those seven wins came by an average of 32 points per game And one of those was out of conference They played Illinois in New York and beat him by 43 Boy Duke has really shut down the lane in this second half for North Carolina Davis follows his miss but cant lay it in and its Duke ball with a minute 45 to go And for the most part it has been one shot and out this entire game for North Carolina Six offensive rebounds and four of them have been team rebounds which meant the ball just went out of bounds and they kept it and Flag just drove it about 40 ft and slammed it home with two hands Nobody with vision from the weak side Ben Allen Luben so concentrated on his man and that was an exclamation point on this Duke win in the Smith Center And after a great charge at the end of the first and early in the second it is not going to be the win that the Tarheelss so desperately needed So let me ask you what do you think they need to accomplish in Charlotte to make the NCAA tournament I think they need to get to the final of the ACC tournament Well and again the way the seeds line up they would run into Duke if they both make it that far in the semis The problem is there arent any or many quad wins available Yep In the ACC tournament into Luben and hell slam it and a timeout taken by Hubert Davis But its all academic now A 13point lead for the Blue Devils with just 40 seconds to go Cooper flag on the left side of the floor and he just gets past Drake Powell with the left hand drive and nobody had vision Ben Allen Luben was just so concentrated on Malik Brown that he wasnt able to get there Thats just too far to be able to go off the bounce without anybody coming over from the weak side and mom and dad who have been at so many games in which Flag has played this year are part of a small but happy group of Blue Devils fans gathered behind the Duke bench for the Tarheelss Itll be their 12th loss They will drop to 1 and 11 in quad one games and senior night will not end the way that RJ Davis had hoped it would Well its been a valiant effort It was vintage RJ Davis in that first half but after scoring five points early in the second half hes not been able to find any openings You have to give Dukes defense credit especially when Malik Brown switched out on him You know Seion James had him for a time but Duke really shut off the lane and didnt allow any interior scoring in the second half In the first half Carolina was getting into the paint especially the last four minutes of the first half And a foul And now some subs coming And well see if RJ Davis is one of those to come out It looks like he will be as he walks off the court here at the Dean Smith Center for the final time What a career What a player has represented this program and this institution very well for 5 Applause years The Blue Devils will go to 191 It will be an outright ACC regular season title a game ahead of Louisville and Clemson And they will all gather in Charlotte with really only three locks out of this conference to make the tournament right now Well see what happens over the next week The rebound down to Trimble Just 10 seconds to go turned over to James and that is going to do it Duke took a punch late in the first and early in the second but rallied to win by 13 and they are the outright ACC regular season champions This is a complete basketball team
