this because theyve got to pick up some quad one wins between now and selection Sunday Miami needs this one and Clemson always wants to hold serve at home but Clemsons road record is what set their resume apart winning at North Carolina at Syracuse and at Alabama Early in the season Kean George with the ball didnt play in the last game against Carolina he rolled his ankle early in the Virginia game last week so he basically missed two games doubt that hes 100 but he is back in the starting lineup as we start you with the Clemson starting lineup an incredible amount of experience this quintet of players has combined Jay to play in 561 games in their Collegiate careers and it starts with Joseph Gerard III who was honored before the game for reaching the 2000 point mark in his career did that up at syacuse a few days ago well Clemson just running Joseph Gerard off a baseline stagger and he curled it right in the middle of the lane that is a difficult shot but his stroke so Compact and thats a difficult cover Gerard was on George and George showing no ill effects from the ankle as he turned the corner and laid it in Kean George had 12 points and five assists against Clemson in the first game he is an Uber talented freshman thats getting better and better PJ Hall guaranteed to be a first team all ACC player this year having a great year up among the leaders in scoring and blocks in the AC and an Aon pass goes out of bounds back over to Miami take a look at Joseph Gerard on the Baseline and hes going to come off a little Baseline stagger and right on his inside hip was Nigel pack so he curled right off of it the ability to make that midrange shot you know he can knock down three hes one of the best threepoint Shooters the accs ever seen Matthew Cleveland with Ian shefflin on him really Miamis got four guards or four perimeter players around nor ch omir including Cleveland who knocks down the corner three thats what Miami wants to do Dan get catch and shoot opportunities their efficiency on catch and shoot is so much better than when they dribble into a shot and Clemsons going to want to make them put it on the deck rather than shoot from the catch spot we asked Jim Len AER this morning when you rewatched the tape of the first game with Clemson what did you see and he said two things as popper knocks down to three great start for Miami he said first of all 19 assists nine turnovers got to play like that to win and to your point about catch and shoot versus dribble 177 points per possession on catch and shoot 66 when its off the dribble so more than two and 1 half times is effective when the balls moving I was told there would be no math youre good at it though I mean if Jim Len has given us that that shoot around this afternoon thats making the air well its its in their notes which is a little bit surprising that they put that in their notes but it just shows how much they want to emphasize moving the ball so you can get catch and shoot opportunities rather than dribbling too much and trying to create it on your own Gerard to the trailer hall now back to Gerards got deep deep range and hes got all five early for Clemson Matthew Cleveland when the pass was made by Gerard up top just came off him a bit and Joe Gerard is one of those guys you cannot ever close out to him you have to be on him all the time and not help off and looked over to the student section behind us and said come on lets make some noise rebound for sheelan third in the ACC 9 and 12 boards per game and the top offensive rebounder in the league just great positioning and really smart with watching where the ball comes off sets a screen for Chase Hunter flying in his hole but the rebound down to Wugga popper Wugga Poppers been limping a lot lately but doesnt look like hes limping when he runs he really gets up and down the floor quickly nice long stretch without a whistle in the early going PJ Hall knocks down the three and its all tied up at eight PJ Hall in his last four games was five of 24 from three but he took that with a great degree of confidence in transition great match up between Hall and NAD oir two of the best big guys in the conference popper no Hall the rebound NORAD omir of Miami is having a spectacular season hes only 65 but he plays like hes 611 he is a load got a chance to be first team all ACC as well Chase hunter from the corner three straight frees for the Tigers a 90 run to give them the lead after they were down 8 Music Applause to2 good job by Chase Hunter to go underneath that screening action and meet Nigel pack on the other side of the screen omir thinking about the three launches doesnt hit and nobody getting near the offensive glass for Miami here in the early going well theyre playing Five out and when omir is out top theres nobody in there to rebound unless they get a run up kanes made their first three have missed their last five and now Jay Clemson has gotten hot PJ Hall shooting just 30 from three but he is not afraid to pull the trigger on it Chase Hunter he has always hunted shots in his career little different with Joseph Gerard but hes Clemson has knocked down three consecutive threes theyre on a 90 run right now and again they have set themselves up very nicely you talked about some of the road WIS they put together uh a nice nonconference schedule they did pretty well you know beating Alabama beating South Carolina back about 6 eight weeks ago those were nice wins then they look like great wins now with the kind of Seasons that those two teams U have had and as you know Clemson wound up on the wrong side of the bubble last year it does not look look like that is going to happen again they appear to be safe leing but theres still a lot of basketball to be played but theyre putting together with nice resume yeah I they should have been in the tournament last year I thought that was a mistake by the committee not to have Clemson in the field but this year its a nobrainer but like you say theres still ways to go RJ Godfrey has checked in for Ian shefflin nor Shad omir running the floor and thatll snap the 90 run and get the canes back within one when kesan George grabs a rebound you he when I first saw him he reminded me of Anthony black at Arkansas last year as a top five pick to the Orlando Magic he is a really talented player but he can just rip and run to start the break by himself now we talked about the Clemson resume so far on the season the nice wins at a conference the nice Road wins look at the net 29 four wins in Quad one just beat North Carolina at Carolina and were this close to winning a Duke as well lost by one a couple of questionable or controversial calls down the the stretch went against them otherwise they might have pulled off a win at Cameron as well but they have had a very nice season so far yeah Clemsons Road wins are separating wins there arent many teams that have that on their resume good ball Movement by Miami shot clock at five poppler the kick benley Joseph from the corner knocks down the three and thats what Jim Lena wants to see the ball moving from side to side and wiga popper gave a fantastic shot fake to open up that catch and shoot opportunity for benley Joseph and Joseph was terrific in the first game between these two at 12 points six rebounds and four steal RJ Godfrey getting on the glass and tipping it in to tie the game wson has more bodies to throw at Music Applause Miami Matthew Cleveland misses the three and Hull another rebound for Clemson I think if Clemson can get into some of their High low action hed like to see PJ Hall go down and try to put omir into the post and make him guard there yeah youd like to see each big guy try to get the other big guy in foul trouble that both coaches desperate to keep their guys on the floor as long as possible and now Hall thought he was fouled by omir and now Godfrey kind of grabbed the hip of popper I believe it was and he gets called for the Music foul now look at some of the games coming your on Saturday got an ACC game to get it started Duke is down in Tallahassee at 2 eastern Kansas in Oklahoma at 4 Eastern and then you and I in the game day gang we will be at Auburn Kentucky at Auburn 6 Eastern a great afternoon and evening of Hoops on ESPN well be on the planes at Auburn to see the Tigers take on Kentucky that means on Saturday well have a great game well have game day in the morning on Friday night Lucys one of your favorite spots on the circuit its fantastic popper from the Baseline well you cannot allow him to just come off a screen and catch and shoot on the short side of the floor he has not quite looked like himself since suffering a sprained ankle December the 29th missed a couple of games including the first game between these two teams and theyd love to get it back as close to 100 as soon as possible as RJ godre has his second bucket of the night just a strong post up got that deep position and oneonone the post against noo you have to swarm the ball when it gets into the post and get it out of there popler from 17 not this time rebound Hunter ball is loose and back to Music popler and a travel called on Bley Applause Joseph Joseph has started more often than not this year he started at the beginning of the year then K George became a starter but then Miami got hit by a bunch of different injuries five different players have missed either one or two games mostly with ankle injuries so its rare they had really been at 100 physically well and even when players are available those particular players arent at full strength I mean Matthew Cleveland Jim Laro saying looked great in practice yesterday but hes been struggling with that hit pointer that he suffered against Notre D chony Wiggins the 610 sophomore from Grayson Georgia into the game and knocks down a three Wiggins has Got Talent he played great against Memphis early in the season if that was the only game you saw him play youd think is he a first round draft piic popper lost it Godfrey to Gerard and Here Come the Tigers good hands by Beetle Gerard looking for the foul call didnt get Applause it well its nice for Miami that Michael noo come in and give them solid minutes tough shot by Cleveland around and out aoko and sheflin battling for it and Gerards got it and settles things down for Clemson I think those are the shots some of the shots that Jim Len was talking about a shot off the dribble that was contested and its just lower percentage you get a catch and shoot Matthew Cleveland can knock those down all day boy how is Gerard so wide open a break there for Miami that he missed that one yeah thats a Joe Gerard layup isnt Music it got I believe now 367 career threes four years at Syracuse and now spending his last year at Clemson and if he makes 803s tonight he can catch JJ re were tracking that feverishly noo needs some help and finds George shot clocks at four does George know it he does misses a 35footer naoko I think that ball hit the rim that hit the rim they called a shot clock violation but that ball looked like it hit the rim it did and I think the referees are going to discuss it a Timeout on the floor theyll CH it over we thought live we thought it hit the rim as we said and you can see it did you can see the ball changes so there may have been do they put a second or two back on the clock what were wondering about too and were going to find out right now for Matt Potter how this sorts out they never it 19 so theyre going to reset did he say reset the shot clock to 19 and Miamis ball I guess because the ball came down in new had it at the time called team control they call that team control so its the same thing if theres a uh a goal 10 call and theres team control on essentially the rebound after the goal 10 and they find out that its not a goalen when they review it Brad Brownell looking on his 14th season as the head coach here at Clemson three NCAA bids 2011 2018 20 and 21 and very likely it seems to add another one to that total here this year he has done a spectacular job here at Clemson Brad Brown Al is one of the most respected coaches not only in the ACC but beyond and this is a game with just two great coaches I think Jim Lara is a nasmith Hall of Famer and hes on the ballot hes a nominee this year a lot of nominees so its no certainty hell get in but he is on the ballot I believe this is the second time that Jim is on the ballot I wonder how many coaches have taken a team like George Mason to the final four like Jim did in 2006 and then Miami last year hurricanes with an outstanding season a year ago went 15 and five of the ACC coleague chance omir denied by Hall but its tipped out to Joseph well omir just went right into Halls chest and knocked him backwards that is one strong player Nigel pack from the corner and the rebound down to shefin Nigel pack is battling some soreness in his knees he tweaked one of them the left one in the Saturday game against Carolina the guys played a ton of minutes and Jim larena was telling us hes gone through you know the NBA Combine process they took a summer trip to France hes just played a ton of basketball and every now and again listen theyre theyre young men but they play a ton of basketball and his knees just arent 100 right now but hes battling through it yep shot clock at two knows it and an air ball turns it back over to Miami good defensive possession for Miami and Miamis defense always seems to ratchet up when Bley Josephs in the game hes their best perimeter Defender and Miami will switch basically one through four they dont want to switch and put nshadow oir on a guard where he can pick up a Applause foul Miami hasnt scored in almost four minutes and oo they had a good opportunity there Nook couldnt finish the lob a little bit bigger lineup for Miami with noo and omir on the floor together trying to counter the size of Hall and shefin Gerard again got it hes not going to miss two wide open shots in a row that wasnt really wide open there was late pressure but his stroke is so Compact and near perfect his second three of the game hes got eight Clemson by six Joseph hoists a three and rattles it home talk about a three and D guy hes in there to defend distribute the ball which he does very well and make the occasional three but he can really change the tenor of the game with his defense snaps a drought of 4 minutes and 15 seconds for Miami on the Baseline be needle too strong those are tough shots in that little short Music Applause corner and hes done a good job of moving the ball early Applause shot clock at 10 popper guarded by Gerard into the paint step back short didnt seem like he had any lift there well defended by Gerard offensive rebounds uh basically a non entity so far in this game Gerard leans in and is fouled by wga Applause popper one of the things that Joe Gerard does so well in addition to shoot it is hes always prepared his hands are ready and look how when he catches it he sets his feet so quickly and lines him up directly in line with the basket his shot preparation is really impeccable and basically automatic at the line we tempt fate here Jay 71 for 76 93 on the season to lead the conference and as we told you reached the 2000 point mark in his career with a really nice game up at the spot he used to play up at Syracuse on Saturday had 18 points and was onon it before the game tonight for reaching 2000 points and he has fit in extremely well here in Clemson well he was well received when he went back to Syracuse and passed that 2000 point mark and did it in a win which is even sweeter he was named ACC player of the week had two good games one at Carolina one at Syracuse the win for Clemson of Carolina last week makes them 2 and 60 all time in Chapel Hill but but they started 0 and 59 they won two with the last three Applause there George throws it behind cin Miami turns it over Clemson leading by five 739 to go in the first half wake makes a push can they get five is there anybody else what what do you where do you see things winding up for the AC this year well I think wake is an NCAA tournament team they just need to beef up that resume a little bit its its a little bit odd they dont seem to have the wins to match how good they are great cut along the Baseline by Hunter but a team to watch out for to get into the tournament is Pittsburgh I mean Pittsburghs had a couple of Great Road WIS you know winning you know they hung over 70 on Virginia Which sounds doesnt sound like much for most teams but you hang 70 on Virginia youve done something well Miami just scored 38 against Virginia and then pit went in there and scored 74 beat him by 11 and pit also won in Cameron Indoor Stadium yes so theyre theyre starting to come on and theyve got talent Blake hinsons one of the best players in the the ACC if not the country one of the best Shooters and talk about being able to make difficult challenge shots especially from three pit net is 53 right now Joe lardy has them under consideration but they appear to still have work to do as does Miami a final four team a year ago and obviously theyve lost some great players Isaiah Wong Jordan Miller there always changes in college basketball but its been a bit of a struggle for Miami theyre small theyve had some injuries they been in a lot of games but uh they again they have to pick it up here towards the end of the season if theyre going to get into the dance they still host Duke they still go to North Carolina so you dont look at those as tough at this point of the year you got to look at those as opportunities and thats what tonight is as well for Miami this is an opportunity to pick up a quad one win yeah I think Dan we all do it we get caught up into whats the best conference is the Big 12 is it the Big East you know the SEC the ACC when you get in the committee room it doesnt matter you know everybodys an individual and they the committee doesnt care what your conference record is versus other conference teams theyre looking at your resume because all these schedules are unbalanced theyre not and not everybodys playing the same games and and same road games its not like in the old days where youre playing a home and home against everybody so its its not sort of the Apples to Apples thing your body of work as a whole your last 10 doesnt matter your last 10 used to kind of be a thing that doesnt matter anymore just body of work overall right body of work overall and its your individual body of work your conference affiliation doesnt mean Applause Music anything well good ball pressure there by omir tough catch for Hall and what theyre doing is extending the catches George ahead to Cleveland who slams it and Miami gets back within four Matthew Cleveland is as fast end to end as any forward or small forward in the country and hes having a really good year despite the injuries that hes suffered you hes averaging close to 15 points 6 and 1 12 rebounds and hes a good offensive rebounder as well one of the most versatile players in the league missed two games in part of the third with a hip injury happy birthday to Jack Clark Jr as he knocks down a three hes only played in 13 games because of injury his last three games he was three of 17 from the field thats a big shot for Jack Clark whos really helped in rebounding for Clemson came off off season hernia surgery and it just took a while for him to get right one of the things Jim Lena loves or excuse me that Brad Brown now loves is that Jack Clarks doing a lot of rebounding from the small forward position if you will 25 rebounds in the last three games and he was a good rebounder at NC State nine points a game to go along with seven rebounds just a a late close out by Matthew Cleveland they know the scouting report that he was three of his last 17 so he can close out late but he was prepared to shoot that on the catch how about Clemson as a team 6 for 10 from threepoint range in this game five different guys who knocked one down already Nigel pack looking to get going hes yet to score in this game and almost turned it Applause over omir wants to go to work on on Hall the kick George for Music three Miamis getting some good looks but those are good shots and good inside outside interaction to get that shot for kesan George and Hunter got bumped into by Joseph who is called for the foul even with kind of a rash of fouls in the last couple of minutes look how low they are three on Clemson four on Miami with five and a half to go how come nobody ever says the announcer Jinx when you say something like that Laughter its always on free throw always on free throws many years later Id like to apologize to JJ reck I cost him a streak during one game I remember did he really oh yeah the rebound George off the Gerard Miss why was reic pitching a no hitter or something I think he had he had made a million in a row and I said well hes made a million in a row and that was the end itll happen a good challenge Inside by Jack Clark when NORAD omir went to the right side of the basket Clark did a really good job of Walling up and making that a difficult shot probably fouled him fouled him Laughter twice Gerard has been on George most of the game I dont know if that you had to guess matchups at the beginning of the night you would have thought this is where Gerard would be but this is where hes been and George beats him here knocking down a three well how about that move little jab step crossover to get into that shot that is one Uber talented freshman thats just scratching the surface of how good hes going to be there have been 18 made field goals in this game 11 of them have been three six by Clemson five by Miami havent been a lot of offensive rebounds either part of it thereve been longer rebounds so theyre more available to guards than big guys wga popper kept alive and Halls got it for Clemson first thing you have to do this is not a transition opportunity but you always have to find Joseph Gerard first Josh Beetles going to try a three not sure Brad branell is going to be half with that one off essentially off the first pass topper into traffic and Hall just stood him up no foul call there on PJ Hall and again yet another long stretch without a whistle in this game well that was a vertical contest by PJ Hall and that that was looked upon as offense initiated contact and Chase Hunter responds to the other end with a corner Three Time Out Jim Lena the tigers are hot from the perimeter in this one Carolina the defense has hasnt been quite the same the last couple of games Syracuse look really good in the win for Carolina uh on the weekend Carolinas still obviously a terrific team but not playing quite as well Jay as they were a couple of weeks ago well when you lead with defense as Carolinas done if you dont show up one game youre going to get taken advantage of and Syracuse shot 63 in that game thats hard to win on the road when you let the opponent shoot 63 Matthew Cleveland takes a tough one over Jack Clark and the rebound down to Joe Gerard Miami now down to 30 9 for 30 so far in this game 5 for 15 from three just four for 15 from two now Clemsons making it difficult on Miami after the quick start everythings been contested Ian sheflin did a great job with a block out on North Shadow who was right there for an offensive board he just wedged him out when he jumped Dylan Hunter line drive three Gerard the tip a collision and it still belongs to Clemson with 20 back on the clock a Clemson is shooting well and they can shoot it but you dont want to fall in love with the three I still think Clemson thats just thats what they call incidental contact both players going after the ball but I still think Clemson wants to go inside its a little bit different without PJ Hall in there you can play high low with Ian sheflin Chase Hunter back to Gerard Dylan hunter in the game as well Gerard inside had it blocked Here Comes Joseph and he fumbled it and then Chase Hunter blocked it Joseph for three and this broken scrambly transition play results in a three for Miami well fitting that benley Joseph would get that catch and shoot on the left side of the floor hes a lefty but what a great block yeah he got just a little bit off balance with that shot fake from Gerard but still recovered to block the shot just a great defensive play by an outstanding Applause Defender watch benley Joseph here gets right back in front and then able to block it with the right hand and then what a fabulous block by Chase Hunter to save a basket from Matthew Cleveland It ultimately led to that Joseph 3 you know Jay if you had watched the whole game but you didnt know the score wouldnt you think Clemsons up by more than four points yes absolutely and part of it has been I think you heard Sean far say it that Miamis been able to take some turnovers uh a couple of defensive rebounds theyre getting out and play Defender but he just lifts the level of everyone and part of it has been Clemsons shot selection has not been good the last 5 minutes theyve taken some challenge shots some of them been tough twos and Im not sure theyve been as Resolute to get the ball inside as perhaps Brad Brownell would like and when youve got Ian sheflin and PJ Hall on the floor some of that high low action can be really affected Halls only attempted one shot as we mentioned he made a three sheflin has not attempted a shot in this game kind of stunning for both for both of them to have combined for just one field goal attempt theres the high low look Gerard crosscourt now shefflin gets into the paint puts it up left it short and Miami can hold for the final shot of the half and possibly go into halftime with a Applause Music lead Applause 10 Applause seconds boy and George forces up an extremely tough shot as they never got anything going that was just 20 seconds of dribbling and clearly you could see he was looking for the foul and Chase Hunter opts not to put up the half cord shot as he and the Tigers go to the break with a onepoint lead 31 30 and the half Clemson over Miami lets go back to the studio along with Shawn and the coach heres Kevin one point down going into the second half so I think Jim Lena has to feel pretty good that his team didnt play as well as hed like but I think Clemsons got to start going inside and playing inside out both teams shot the three better than they shot two pointers and and both shot more threes than twos the two teams combined to go seven of 27 on twos which is hard to do so maybe we give some credit to the defenses as well but as you said the shot selection left a little bit to be desired the foul totals were very low and this is a big big game again for both teams Clemson trying to solidify what looks like a an eventual trip to the NCAA tournament and Miami needs quad one wins shefflin goes to work and omir down with a rebound seventh rebound of the night for nor shadir on that possession PJ hall went with a high ball screen then got right down into the post I think thats where hes got to spend most of his time in this second half George is tricked who they get Gerard first on Joe Gerard when is the last time you think you did a game when to start the second half nobody in the game had two fouls foul toes very low well often times when a low foul total the second half theyre a lot of whistles Cleveland trying to drive by shefflin Good Help by Hall shot clock at five and an offensive foul on kesan George the first guy in the game with two fouls just use that off Applause Music arm quick duck in theres the high low thats Clemson basketball right there but Hall missed the jump hook you see them run that play and very effectively time and time again well it gives PJ Hall not only an opportunity to score but more of an opportunity to get fouled Nigel pack soft off the glass wont go haul the rebound Nigel pack averaging better than 14 scoreless tonight remember that first game Miami did all their damage after halftime they scored 60 points in the second half shot over 70 95 82 down at Coral Music Gables Miamis lost two in a row coming into this one Clemsons one two in a row omir with his second field goal of the night just oneonone nobody came over to try to get the ball double team get the ball out of his hands or at least show bodies nor shadir is just having a great year hes done everything for Miami wouldnt you say hes been one of the F best Five Guys in the league hes got a shot at First Team all AC no question I mean hes leading him with scoring rebounding offensive rebounding steals Hall no Hall will be first team all ACC RJ Davis will I think Kyle filipowski will and but nor Chad oir deserves to be in that conversation the spins off Jack Clark and Ian shefflin doesnt come over to show him another body I you got to show you got to show norat a lot of bodies inside rather than seeing just wood on his way to the rim nice look inside shein with a jam a really good use of the body by Ian shefflin just a little duck in right under the basket and cleared that space out he does such a good job using his body and positioning himself both to score and to rebound you talk about a guy whos gotten better every year hes a junior now out of Loganville Georgia and omir with the three that is his 14th made three of the Season he is shooting them much more often and making them at a very respectable clip this year than he did his first three years two at Arkansas State and then one here with Miami last year Gerard with a cut in the layup well you cant get caught ball watching and thats what happened to Nigel pack over in the right corner and Joe Gerard as soon as he saw pack turn his head just made that corner cut to the basket for the easy score what makes a guy a good cutter is it just awareness awareness and then knowing where the ball is and cutting off the movement of the ball pack up and under no and hes down in the court its five on four if the Tigers hustle Gerard the open look rebound Cleveland the transfer from Florida State popper counter boy they are so dangerous in transition they just run to that threepoint line and theyre looking to fire remember the days when you have a break everybody runs to the rim those days are over they are running to the threepoint line fast break points now 10 nothing Miami the answer for the other end for Joe Gerard Nigel pack again just overh helping you know usually the further your man is away from the ball the more you can help but that is not true when youre guarding Joe Gerard you have to stay with him Cleveland no and I would think if were Nigel pack or Joe Gerard and I was covering the other guy I would say pretend hes me because both of them have unlimited range and dont need a lot of time or space to get the shot off yeah you have to change how you guard when you play those guys I mean Joe Gerard is a no close out guy if youre closing out to him youve made a mistake defensively DJ Hull will be at the free throw line where we come back when we come back tied at 38 here at Clemson and another look at a beautiful cut and a beautiful feed just reading the defense and Nigel pack just overh helping here and that left Gerard wide open for the three thats a layup for him theyre looking to make a move in the last several weeks and get into the bubble conversation the postseason conversation well Pittsburgh has Believers and theyve got a bunch of different shot makers Carlton Carrington but Blake Henson is a guy how many tough shots to see make in a game PJ Hall at the line a 1 on the season averaging just under 20 points per game over seven rebounds per game shooting 50 from the field and he was great against North Carolina 25 points and nine rebounds against the tar Applause Hills you dont see many guys who have been at the same school for four years anymore with everybody transferring but PJ Hall is one of those guys and hes another guy thats gotten better every year you mentioned it about Ian shefer Applause I think PJ Hall averaged about three points a game his freshman year and now hes a 20 point a game scorer yeah and the last two years played with injuries had offseason stuff and missed some time played but wasnt 100 but had a healthy summer this year and you can see it in the results here this year step back by Nigel pack and the rebound down to Jack claron when Miami moves the ball from side to side they get much better shots good fake Hall into the paint Scoops it up and in and PJ Hall starting to assert himself here in the second half thats where he uses that threepoint shot to set up the drive and that shot fake allowed him to get all the way to the rim that was not an easy finish with the right hand on the left side of the basket Brad Brownell wants this place to get a little bit noisier right now on defense George driving on Applause Gerard omir traveled PJ Hall needs to get a little bit more assertive and Kean George closing out to him the shot fake got him off balance that opened up the lane and he just basically Euro stepped right around nor Chad omir to finish on the other side of the rim Chase Hunter on the bench right now Josh Beetle at the point Gerards out there in the back court with him benley Joseph back on Joseph Gerard Beetle a lefty Scoops it in with a right and extends the lead for the Tigers Matthew Cleveland just cant go for that fake that was just a simple ball fake and he opened up the middle as a result of that time out Jim Lena Clemson back in Music front Jay Godfrey is going to set a little wing ball screen here and slip out of it but a great ball fake by Josh Beetle and Matthew Cleveland bites on it leaves the floor and that just opens up the middle and Clemson getting a better quality shot early in the second half theyre five of 10 from the field in large measure because theyve been a little bit more Resolute about getting a piece of the paint not just settling for threes lets as they come out of the timeout PJ Hall on the bench and Again Brad Brownell whose voice carries through anything picked a moment when the band had stopped before the ball was inbounded and just yelled at the student section come on lets go he wants more noise here in this building tonight this is a big game for the Tigers not just for the hurricanes and with PJ Hall out of the game NORAD omir just locked down RJ Godfrey in the low post he got so low and once he caught the ball it was over boy thats a tough little bounce pass in traffic from Beetle to Clark Clark fouled now watch NORAD omir here when the ball gets to the right side he just it was shefflin so he just pushes shefflin right under the basket a little drop step you get position that deep youre not going to be able to stop NORAD omir just so strong and if hes 65 that would be a lot hes unders sized but he plays a lot bigger than his height so explosive 240 lb as strong a guys youll face probably anywhere in the country heck of a baseball player growing up in Nicaragua hed be a heck of a tight end if he wanted to be yeah we were talking about that do you think any NFL teams will will come around after and say hey NORAD youre interested in maybe trying football out coming to Camp or something like that well I think hes going to play in the NBA now at his size obvious obviously he would have to shoot the ball well from the perimeter to do that but hes got a ton of other skills he can knock down a perimeter shot y but he can be a rotation player in the NBA with the way he rebounds he can run the floor big and strong and whos going to get in his way when he gets ahead of steam going to the Applause basket he shoots almost 80 from the foul line I think hes 78 averages just under 10 rebounds per game almost 18 points per game sixth in the ACC in scoring second in rebounding behind Armando Bott and second in field goal percentage hes like Miamis bamat of Bio University of Miamis ban out bio they already have a Miami ban out Music bio Clemson by three s minutes into the second half here at Little John Applause Music Hall back into the game for the Tigers twoman game with Gerard open is Clark the step in the pull up rebound Cleveland Cleveland starting the Applause break hand off for Joseph thought about it deep one for George and he hits it to tie the game well benley Joseph set that up with the penetration the collapsed the defense a bit and the catch and shoot opportunities for Miami so much more efficient Kean George a freshman from Switzerland and a guy who multiple NBA Scouts come out to see every time Miami plays omir with a bucket beautiful feeding traffic from Joseph just excellent attack in transition attacking in the slot drawing the defense and just kicking it off to omir but that was not a good shot by PJ call and he can obviously make that shot but off of one pass they didnt make Miami guard and all of a sudden theyre sprinting back in transition Gerard it looked like it was contact there and down to George theyre trying to get the ball into shefin and take advantage of the size that hes got on Cleveland but they havent really been able to do it and George at the other end to extend the lead anytime that Miamis grabbing a rebound theyre getting out in transition quickly and really putting a lot of pressure on Clemsons transition defense thats when Miamis gotten its best offense is getting down the floor quickly and getting something early and a look at a recent bucket by Miami Joseph getting inside drawing a crowd omir lays it Music in and Dan there are two players in the country that are averaging at least 17 points at least nine rebounds and at least 61 from the field nor shadir is one do you know the other a large Canadian am I correct Zach Edy Zack Edy its pretty good company Applause yes lets see what the response is from the Tigers they have been styed recently the offensive end and the key matchup is benley Joseph on Joseph Gerard Beetle spins forces it up draws the foul it looked like wga popper just brought that right arm down enough to pick up that foul he was in pretty good position on the beetle Music Drive NBA Allstar Weekend begins Friday in Indianapolis with the celebrity game on ESPN and the ESPN app and it should be entertaining stepen A Smith and Shannon sharp are the head coaches our coverage begins at 7 Eastern four Pacific from from Lucas Oil Stadium she I hope the stepen A Smith huddles are miked we need to hear that Clemson back within Applause Music Applause two omir banging with Hall up and in thats just pure strength and some skill and Agility there from nor Chad oir no question right through the body of PJ Hall and when he takes that right hand dribble and gets into your body and Spins back how you going to stay in front and how you going to jump to to bother it thats just tremendous physicality Beetle cant get around popler Chase Hunter is wide open misses the three sheflin battling for it its out of bounds and it is Clemson ball Ian shefflin goes after every ball theres never a shot goes up that he doesnt go to the glass so quick sheflin story there is an intermural basketball team here at Clemson that kind of has made themselves the Ian sheflin fan club and he saw the post on Instagram last night and he went and coached their intral basketball ball game last night he coached the inter mural team and they win so hes one and0 one and0 I undefeated quit hurry up agent only 20 seconds left big guys here in the second half can they yes but you have to have more production out of these two scoring and Ian shefflin not a big time scorer but you know he averages you know close to 10 points a game but his rebounding is one of the best in the country but PJ Hall does not look himself in this game we saw him when he went out earlier looking like hes a little bit ill so he may be fighting through some kind of bug who knows yeah we were told he is a little bit under the weather he did practice this morning but maybe not qu feeling quite like himself sheflin doing what sheflin does the offensive rebound well sheflin wanted the ball badly down on the post has popler on him they dont get it to him now he steps out inside Hall and a foul on Miami but benley Joseph read that really well just got a piece of the arm going right underneath PJ Hall but thats the kind of pass that often times he can deflect or steal so Hall will head back to the line for the Tigers the front half of the ACC schedule more difficult for Clemson than the back half looks as you look at PJ Halls career number you talked about just three and a half points per game as a freshman hes gotten better and better and is clearly a first team all ACC player this year but including tonight five of their last eight are home games their three Road games are at Georgia Tech at Notre Dame and then at wake four again wakes a good team thatll be a heck of a game but if you look at the schedule overall for Brad Brown Ls team going the rest of the way theyre already through the harder part of their conference schedule and if they can just win games theyre supposed to win theyre in great shape you can see the upcoming schedule for them over the next couple of weeks they are down three in this one though on their home court Cleveland left alone and buries it to make it a Sixpoint lead a really good play little ball screen and the roll cleared out everyone and then Matthew Cleveland just pops into that open area for that catch and shoot shot sheflin going to work on the smaller Defender than Joseph but too strong off the glass even when Miami switches that means Clemsons going to have to attack those switches and sometimes that can get you off of what you normally Applause Music Applause Music do 10 on the shot clock Cleveland trying to drive by shefflin now kicks it to pop and its Clemson ball with 9 minutes to go Clemson down six so hard to guard Miami cuz sometimes theyre conscience free its not that those those are bad shots but they go up quickly and sometimes it surprises you shefin for three yes and boy did they need that and that was with wga popper flying right at him he didnt even Applause flinch Applause first field goal in over five minutes for the Tigers has him back within three turn around omir great box out there by Beetle to allow shefflin to get the rebound a tough little shot from the short corner by omir Beetle drives and hits and its a onepoint game well hes been aggressive driving ball the Lefty driving right going back to that left hand six on the night now for Beetle Clemson more active defensively pushing Miami a little bit further out on the floor and it has gotten noisier here at Little John Brad brownells down in a stance on the Clemson bench walk and a travel called on George Timeout on the floor Here Come the Tigers as they have come back within one Ian shefflin has been strong on the glass last then steps out for that three and Josh Beetle the SE game you know Bruce Pearl has brought so much energy to that program and theyve obviously had some very good teams in recent years and there are few things that get peoples blood boiling like Kentucky on the road and itll be fun on Saturday night well Kentucky played it one of its best defensive games against Old Miss last night they were the aggressor defensively and theyre going to have to be the aggressor against Auburn cuz Auburn along with Houston leads the nation in playing hard Hall working on omir and omir wins the battle you just cant move him much too strong that was a physical confrontation on that back down but Clemson when they have the ball they have to keep attacking the the paint Miami does not want to foul him and Clemsons so far had the advantage from the foul line George keeps his toe down and buries the three what a big play play by George Kean George has 13 points five rebounds and six assists in this game hes turned it over four times but overall hes played an excellent floor game only seven hurricanes have played and Michael noo hasnt played much only five have scored Chase Hunter with a corner three at the other end and thats one thing Clemson has to keep in mind that they should try to attack kesan George on the offensive end make him guard he just was an alert to get the hunter on the right side of the floor he had a wide open look Nigel pack still looking for his first points of the night and comes up empty he is now 0 for seven from the floor and again battling some knee soreness and hes a potentially explosive score he can go off for 25 on any given night well he had 25 against Clemson last time these teams played Hunter fouled by omir and will be going to the line thats what Clemson needs to continue to do dud attack the rim attack the paint draw Defenders draw help play out of it and then if youre strong with the ball youll be going to the free throw line like Chase Hunter that was a strong take right into North Music shadir Chase hunter in his fifth year took a medical red shirt his first year so hes actually got one more year of Eligibility because of the co year and the red shirt who knows if he comes back for a sixth year but hes been playing basketball for a long time got his younger brother Dylan on the team as well backs him up sometimes plays alongside him unusual Miss for Chase Hunter he shoots about 87 from the foul line thats fifth in the ACC but his role has changed a little bit he was a guy that was hunting shots kind of like Joe Gerard does now but hes had to adjust with Gerard in the lineup and does such a good job handling the ball and he can create his own though and hit tough ones Brad Brown now just took both Hall and sheflin out of the game Clark and Godfrey take their place Miami looking to reclaim the lead with 6 minutes to go Id going to omir good hands by Chase Hunter packed tries to save it but its Clemson Applause ball no look pass into the corner Hunters open again Gerard the assist in the Tigers lead great recognition by Clemson with Nigel P saving that ball he was well behind the play and Miami just could not get matched up to Five Guys with four 70 run Clemson Joseph whos made three threes in this game hes played very well for Miami Off the Bench shot clock running down they in trouble turned it over clark lays it in and the lead is five but what an answer by Clemson theyve done it on the defensive end and attacking the rim and Jim Lena is going to use another Music timeout in Miami the last couple possessions there have been a lot more dribbles than passes but in that Advantage situation Clemson took advantage of it just a mishandling of the ball on that Joseph pass to Matthew Cleveland and Jack Clark taking it the other way for the easy score kind of a game of mini runs in this one 0 70 maybe a couple of 90 back and forth theyve gone Clemson has led more often than Miami has and again Clemson wants this game want to keep the good times rolling solidify their position as a tournament team Miami needs this game more than Clemson does yeah I mean you dont want to be thinking all the time when you go into every game that its a a mustwin yeah but theres a sense of urgency once you get to February and February is a separating month I mean the dog days of the season are really January but but you have to start to separate when you get to February and I think Clemsons a team that can separate this is a good basketball team Brad branell has done a great job with this group I think maybe you know programs like Clemson and Wake Forest maybe dont get as much national attention as some other uh programs that are followed more closely or a bigger brand however you want to say but Clemson and wake are very good Virginia despite the loss to pit last night they are having a good season like a lot of the uh bigger conferences its kind of congested in the middle teams trying to break free of that pack the drive the kick Joseph the three and running it down to the corner is Godfrey well Chase Hunter did a really nice job trying to block out Matthew Cleveland it looked like Cleveland had the lane to that ball but Hunters contact on him wouldnt let him release Bo Gerard was open Hunter found him and Gerard has it taken away pack lost it and back on the Music Tigers and Gerards going to slow it down with just over four minutes to Applause go and he will be shooting free throws and I think he was behind the line so if he was yep hes shooting three says Teddy Valentine the way he shoots free throws like an intentional walk just give him the three lets go the other way good use of the ball screen then when Nigel pack reached in got a piece of his arm and he was smart enough to go ahead and launch up that shot about the last guy in the country you want to foul while hes in the act of shooting yeah theres some guys out there that are really good Shooters this is an elite shooter I wonder what his personal best is for consecutive makes like not in a not in games just how many days R he goes without missing how many calendar Applause months what a luxury as a coach when you got a guy like this who can be on the free throw line late in a close game oh late in a close game you know an inbound you say if you dont get it to Joe your your scholarship is gone nothing to it didnt touch any rim on all three of them omir lays it up and in big bucket for Miami to get back within six going with that same play when Matthew Cleveland just Fades out just a and they get a foul on the play as well so with the under four top the SEC Shan this is Cheney Johnson on a missed assignment yeah you get the defense to collapse a little bit as you fake go screen and then roll to the rim the backside is wide open on the cut auers did a great job of attacking the paint next up here coach The Sensational Dalton connect this dude can attack the paint he can knock down a three he can play in ball screens he can grab a defensive rebound and initiate the fast break this dude is a bucket Dalton connect the ball is coming off the loss at a in fville up next Dan and J Kevin guys thank you very much Jay Clemson has gone from down as many as six to back up by six in recent minutes what have they done better theyve done a better job of attacking the paint where Clemson has really been able to separate a little bit as from the free throw line I mean Clemsons 14 of 17 from the foul line and Clemson or excuse me Miami just four of five thats a big difference in free throw attempts so Miamis playing a little bit differently but both teams have made more threes than twos in this game its just Clemsons got to the foul line more nor Chad oir makes the free throw now 18 points 12 rebounds its a fivepoint Game Hunter first to speed and lays it in boy great job off the penetration by Joe Gerard a little banana cut out front it wont go for omir he does not miss many of those Chase Hunter had a terrific game on a night when PJ Hall has not been himself and Chase Hunter has stepped into the void and again Hall may be under the weather two for seven eight points six rebounds trying to fight through it tonight Hunter and Gerard both with big Knights Gerards got a team High 18 shefin bigger than Cleveland draws a double team and feeds his buddy hall and now theyre all smiling for the Tigers Im not sure why nshadow went to double there there was no way to get a rotation down he just left PJ Hall that was about as easy as going to get to get a post toost bucket Joseph no Clark the rebound Im not sure thats the shot that Miami wanted in that situation and Clemson needs to use some clock here y theres no reason to be in a hurry and again we talked about how experien this starting five is and theyre all out there right now sheflin A junor is the least experienced to the group theyve combined to play 561 games coming into this one tonight jar lost it off his foot but it stays must have been off somebody elses leg too it stays with the Tigers Jim Lena about to send kesan George back into the game for Miami off Miami is going to make a push here down nine they got to get a stop here Music Clark the turnaround got it he looked at the shot clock at the other end of the Court realized there were only two seconds on it put it up and hit it that was a huge bucket by Jack Clark with all the action going out to the side that left the middle open and both Hall and Clark could operate to go toward the ball tough turnaround usually a righthander likes to go over his right shoulder but Im not sure exactly why nor shadir decided there to double Ian sheelin because that left PJ Hall as open as hes been since warmups and its an 183 run for Clemson they were down 57 53 theyre now leading 71 60 with less than 2 minutes to go Applause Music trying to avenge a defeat that they suffered at the hands of the Hurricanes down in Coral Gables January the 3D and right now for Clemson Im sure Brad branell is talking to his team about staying with threepoint Shooters the way that Miami can get back into this and threaten this 11point Clemson lead is by knocking down threes and thats what Miami does theyve got 12 threes in this game already but theyre going to be looking to fire Clemsons only committed three fouls this half Miamis already at seven so the Tigers are in the bonus we will see Miami again next week you and I will be down in Coral Gables Duke will be there one a week from tonight well have that game for you on ESPN every seat will be filled for that one yes Jim ARA has had a great record in the ACC against both Duke and North Carolina reminds you when Gary Williams was at Maryland to really challenge the entrenched power of the league no active Division one mens coach has coached more games than Jim Lena tonight is number 1229 its amazing what a rich basketball life hes had played at Archbishop Malloy in New York for the great Jack Curran and then played for Joe melany and yeah you got to get out on that played for Joe meany and Dave Gavin at Providence he played with Ernie D Gregorio Ernie D Providence Clemson gets it over shefflin a wise decision to kick it back Applause out and precious seconds ticking away here for the Hurricanes now its go time for Hunter the kick the extra pass the shot F Bo that would have been an absolutely perfect possession from start to finish had Gerard knocked down the shot and wiga popper trying to get that rebound with Ian shefin just couldnt Corral it went out of bounds so now Clemsons going to have another 20 seconds to run off this Music clock going with a little Flex look out of bounds and no reason to shoot it yet Hunter with the Applause ball Gerard floats it over to Hall who will take a three and hit it acknowledges the student section on his way back down the court Clemsons going to win this Music game what an answer by Clemson late in this game when Miami took that lead would have been easy to kind of fold up a little bit but Clemson exploded and they were tied late at at both Carolina and Syracuse in the last week and had runs in those games as well not quite to this extent but this is three games in a row they have finished strong and will come up with a victory the only decision that the committee has to make with regard to Clemson is going to be what seed y this is an NCAA tournament Team without question why not Chase Applause Hunter a 243 run thats the way you close out a game is it ever Josephs not even going to put a shot up it doesnt look like the shot clock is turned off Miami will just let the seconds tick away Miami was in it for about 35 minutes LED it for several but in the end they suffer their third consecutive defeat and the Clemson Tigers win their third in a row and do it in impressive Fashion on a night when PJ Hall didnt have his best game Chase Hunter forward Joe Gerard was outstanding and Clemson with a resounding win down the Music stretch having a terrific season and its getting a little bit better game by game right now well have more for you from Little John in the aftermath of this 17o
