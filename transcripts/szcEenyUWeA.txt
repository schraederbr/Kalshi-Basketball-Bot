pressure bent at the top of the rankings and assist a turnover and leased fouls under the Mike Bray era for a long long time and a lot of things stay the same for Notre Dame and a different story for Syracuse of course at three and four theyve dropped three consecutive games new territory for the Syracuse Orange right thats not happened before but this is where they come into this building where this is a chance for them to take advantage of size with Jesse Edwards up front like we see in the first possession and if they can score with Notre Dame then they can set their Zone six players on his Irish team are earning masters degrees so half the team is already using their retirement benefits on a Baseline Drive startling The Freshman now hes the one youngster among the starters five and double figures as you mentioned they share the ball so well Music starting lineup here for Syracuse Mintz Gerard whos really struggling with a shot Bell Williams and Edwards and well see if Joe Gerard can get things rolling hes gone down from 21 points a game to 13 coming in hes in a nasty skid Mitchs trying to use the window but it wont drop for him so yeah I look at the way Notre Dame defends as Cormac Ryan tries to keep that hot streak going from the other night the way Notre Dame defense they go under ball screen action they like to keep defenders in front they dont really play up the line or theyre not over aggressive so if you move the ball if your Syracuse and play inside out you are going to get some uncontested shots Bell with an elbow jumper you think the midrange shots making a comeback I definitely think so I mean I I like getting to the nail and playing off the elbows I think those are spots on the floor that are really unguardable so Notre Dame six and one great win against top 20 Michigan State running away the other night when hes averaging 14 and five rebounds another grad Dane did not practice yesterday bothered by a little bit of an ankle but told us before the game he felt great he sees back in the lineup I think you made a great point about coming into this gym as we were walking in a couple of hours ago Bell gives that one away its a great Shooters gym and if you are scuffling a guy like Gerard it can really get you going talk about getting going good I love the combination of the floor the lights the backdrop with the fans it is definitely a Shooters gym to me its up top for Gerard gets off his first shot and that one rolling but it sucked in high up out of the sky by Edwards I think you think Jesse Edwards is fired up that the Netherlands have uh taken down the USA yes in soccer I think because thats where hes from of course hes the Flying Dutchman his nickname probably half and half he had to be rooting for the US to some degree right styling nice job I dont think so getting back up on his feet probably right Ryan swings good ones open again he can do that all day open shot all game against the Syracuse defense well hes hitting 48 from three and hes only adding to that in the early going here on the floor for the Irish could do contested jumper yep and steiny comes away with it hes the Freshman who grew up just 14 miles from Syracuse so he got away as he chose Notre Dame over Su Gerard hitting the deck Syracuse comes away with a defense trying to slice inside over the top and finished up by Edwards I always think Jesse Edwards is an incredible factor in everything that Syracuse does because he defends that back row he can block shots and he is a hard Rim roller he throw it up to the rim hes got length he can finish hes not going to make a lot of shots outside of 10 feet but inside hes tough right lets fly absolutely drains that triple six threepoint shots and head coach Mike Price said thats the best theyve played all year you know their defense was working and man its not working right now at the front of the rim Zone not against number 14 oh Syracuse is getting great penetration theyre getting deep catches theyre able to score inside thats how you get back in Rhythm offensively you build it inside out Music outside not involved too much so far but he can hit the threepointer as well words taking a look the drive starting will lay that one up and it wont drop for him most experienced starting five in the country does have an impact freshman styling is a McDonalds AllAmerican Gerard on the Baseline his Bell to Launch one and done for Su yeah this is where the majority Factor comes in right youre having great success in the paint trying to get the ball inside consistently keep working inside until somebody proves they can take Jesse Edwards out plus you want to put pressure on Notre Dames defense inside theyre not a team that likes to foul Music considerable amount of strength in the off season its paying off Works straight on for a triple and Gerard picks the rebound Music obviously the emphasis for Notre Dame is to get the ball inside try to get to the nail try to work inside and the top against that zone Syracuse trying to keep the ball from going there mints sizes one up cant drop it in Music talk about all the veteran presence for the Notre Dame Fighting

saw JJ starling the 64 freshman come off the floor kind of clutching at the chest area near the shoulder I have no idea what that was all about he took a seat during the timeout and then he went into the locker room so that will give us a chance see works running the point and Lubin will check in on a date another freshman for Notre Dame then Alan Lubin out of Orlando Florida hes been getting good minutes about 19 a game for Mike Bray usually plays about six they wind up playing a couple more extras today especially if styling cant return shot clock down to two and doubt by Gerard thatll be a shot clock violation and the orange will happen so you cant play on top of that zone you got to play inside through the corners you got to have movement and thats what happened in that possession that got stuck on the top of the floor with a ball third year at Notre Dame the 500 games Edwards again in Tights not this time thats the first shot hes missed but I like coming off the timeout Coach Boeheim getting him the ball in the paint Music plays defense without fouling just about 11 fouls a game incredibly low they dont turn it over they dont make a lot of mistakes five players in double Figures its a well put together Notre Dame basketball makes it on the follow all of his own Miss Applause dont confuse a team that plays a little bit under defensively for being soft thats not what Im saying that is not the way they play these are a bunch of tough guys theyre experienced guys they know what it takes to win nice sign there for orange fans Joe Gerard has been under a lot of pressure he had been one for his previous 13 from threepoint land and for a great shooter like that its been a brave concern especially when youre sixth all time and made threepoint Baskets at Syracuse you know Im Im one that believes for a shooter look hes got muscle memory and the ability to selfcorrect like cormack Ryan knows how to get into Rhythm right and if youre struggling as a shooter are you putting up the shots are you putting in the Reps you know Joe Durant is doing that now is it the quality of the catch where is he working to get the ball but really good signs early Syracuse trailing by three Gerard by the way in single digits scoring the last three games so Jim Boeheim trying to find a way to get number 11 rocking and rolling again well he didnt score in the last game is only the second time in his career that he has not scored Brian A Little Fall Away cant stick that battle for the rebound chesky going down and whistle here 11 56 to go and the first half and Notre Dame Point

Music Notre Dame coming in at six and one of all five starters are averaging in double figures a lot of points the most the Mike Ray has had combined on one team so all that experience is starting to pay off six grad students Music coming off that big win against Michigan State a smart classic veteran team very typical of a lot of teams that Mike has had here and you know Mikes talking about every two weeks he goes to dinner with the chefs being Goodwin and Ryan and he listens to him I mean these guys know what it takes to win they have success in the NCAA tournament getting a couple of wins last year and he said I havent had a lot of teams where Im I mean obviously you listen to your guys whove got great relationships with them but this group of guys every couple of weeks he takes him to dinner and he he wants to know what they think about everything theyre doing thats a son thats a veteran right were all on the same page trying to win thats the attitude how do we do that how do we figure it out how do we do it versus opponents how do we stay healthy how do we keep rested and we stay fresh with only playing six or seven guys Starling back on the bench heres Gerard on the attack and hell lay it in Marcus Hammond now into the lineup for the Fighting Irish first time this year he sprained his MCL in the preseason has yet to play until now see good one working in that mid middle of the Zone trying to get a touch kick they have to go and a half back to Joe Gerard 61 senior with the thefts I mean its just a great picked by Gerard and now hes got a couple of baskets Dave you know this is the kind of game as I said that could really get him going draws a lot of attention Goodwin will swing it Music Airborne back to Ryan and a triple coming did not look good coming off his hand and see anytime you make a shooter drop their hands when they have their feet set that is thats tough for them to gather and get off their get their shot up quickly Edwards with a tough catch underneath wow made the shot despite the fact he was way underneath the iron you know what Dave they have not proven they can guard him or stop him and this could be an issue for Notre Dame not just tonight or today but moving forward the same guy they can score on the Block yeah hes got 12 six out of seven hes right on top of the rim most of the time ball with eight on the shot clock there reso to 20 see this is where I think Jesse Edwards has made significant Improvement you know hes Gonna Roll hard to the rim off of any ball screen action in the middle of the floor hes not gonna pop its not gonna short roll hes going to the front of the rim Gerard does a good job of getting the ball and hes catching in traffic and finishing better than he has words lets fly and knocks that down and triple run Trey works thats a great spot to get the ball against the Zone those Corner threes are available slam it on the brakes theres Taylor into the game Justin Taylor with 25 against Bryant hes starting to get more minutes I think he could be a significant addition to them as they move forward in conference play hes got to be able to seek some shots clock at five five one down Jude immense comes in averaging 15 Syracuse has made their last five shots its high to 21 stairs up and in for the two Beluga nice job getting behind the back of the defense coming from that dunker spot to the front of the rim nice pass about a clean game yeah this is clean no fouls no turnovers Taylor will fall away nice shots The Freshman can shoot it hes a muscular 215 yeah hes got great size hes got a nice shooting touch he gets organized quickly when he catches Music three Hammond another day moves the ball so well theres a good one got a great look and finally a whistle in the paint thats the first foul of the game with 904 to go before halftime good muscle on the offensive Glass by Logan Music to the line the 68 freshman Orlando Florida his home pretty much has been a Notre Dame bench

Edwards again nothing but white shirts around him and he take it away transition words Music cave is coming off the timeout by Notre Dame just a little bit faster moving the ball a little bit quicker side to side Starling back in after he came off clutching the chest and the shoulder just a few minutes ago so thats very encouraging shot clock to five the swing here ham is going to take one and got it a threepointer Irishman said Marcus Hammond there yeah his first points of the season its a guy with experience another player that can add to the backboard you cant have enough guards in college basketball transfer from Niagara foreign s trying to get it downstairs somehow it got to Edwards and hell take a hit and go to the line Music his hands high up over everybody else and man are they

four different guys have made a triple Goodwin in the corner you go Swing Swing knocks down another three look at the way the Irish move the basketball they go inside out and if you dont come with a long closeout on their Shooters outside the threepoint line this is what youre gonna get six triples already for Notre Dame they average eight on the season look theyre at Dane Dan Goodwin his father here dead Damon was diagnosed back in November of 15 with leukemia unfortunately has come back that battle continues so Goodwin family fighting off the floor as well very talented basketball player on the court in about 37 minutes a game spent 37 minutes a game and Dane has all of six turnovers yeah they dont turn it over right Edwards at the line here theyre third in the nation at less than nine turnovers a game and with 70 percent the like its filed a lot his parents recently came to watch him play from Amsterdam was delighted by that twopoint game expect this one to come right down the last couple of minutes dont you possession situations absolutely no Notre Dame made an adjustment on their ball screen defense the last possession they switched they had been going uh hard heads and getting over see what happens this time Irish taking their time shot clock to four Starling with a long one too strong and thats going to go out and back see if you just play on top thats not a problem for Syracuses defense okay you gotta dive inside you got to make a pass a penetrating pass you got to get in the gap youve got to make them collapse then you kick Applause you had made the point earlier too Syracuse started with the Zone on a back line a little bit deeper today you know to try and cut these guys in the corners yeah Notre Dame shoots the corner three very well the paint brought a lot of attention that one poked away picked Off by Taylor from the corner knocked down by Justin Taylor Whos in bayheim some really valuable minutes and that was a good decision by Torrance because yeah he could have taken that three but he knows Taylors a better threepoint shooter by percentage so Su by one and a quick moving first half has not been hurt from this man has off Target Ryan English so far very quiet he came in 17 points a game patient you got to be patient against the Zone but the three is working hello Jack with the bounce and rolled in again by Edwards theyve had absolutely no answer for Jesse Edwards theres no question I felt this way about him last year that he was the Difference Maker because he defends protects the rim he can score the paint theyre getting him a high quality catch its hard to miss it when youre that close to the rim Syracuse no understating the value of a victory like this as lacheski comes up empty after what happened against Illinois they got blown out of the gym against Illinois to come back to the Midwest and beat a team like Notre Dame on their floor where they hardly ever lose when they were coming off such a great win over Michigan State you know with everything thats being written and said right now by Jim boeheims program would be a hugely valuable win thats why I felt like this was the right recipe right you get numbers and you attack Torrance with a left hand but no Applause mayheim also going heavy to his bench trying to find answers Goodwin chesky theyre trying to get him into it but hes missed a couple of shots here back and forth they go Taylor again and barely glanced the iron its right here Torrance has to look from three theyre playing him with a cushion Taylor gets outside the threepoint line and gets his feet organized and then Jesse Edwards fantastic on the inside difference right now for Syracuse look at that difference in the paint 16 to 4 SU thats almost exclusively number 14 Notre Dame has gone over three minutes without scoring on the back theres Goodwin cant finish is wide open gone underneath could not make it mess with a pullup pop no see thats where the majority comes in right thats not a good option right now mints got to be patient Let The Game come to him dont try to force it when you dont have numbers sure you got a threepoint lead the other guys are struggling you have to recognize that all part of the Grove theres no denying how talented he is Ryan good look hes not going to miss that shot or Mac Ryan coming up 23 playing all 40 minutes against Tom izzos team win

Jesse Edwards getting hit uh hes been phenomenal coming into this game Notre Dame doesnt have a lot of size at the Five Spot hes been terrific 16 out of 30 points go Irish Seth there you go if you dont say go wires to take their New Jersey fines but sir shes got to keep the ball off the high post or Dodge Dames Gonna Keep On knocking down threes OB number hangs Majestic up there here at the Joyce Center that number 20 its a thing of you I was here when they put the uh a beautiful number up there in the Raptors for fun and he gave such a wonderful speech of course he had them crying here inside the arena but uh the ultimate Class Act youre gonna make me want to run to the bookstore and get number 20 right now yeah theres a run on them right now Starling is mentioned back in the game nicked up that shoulder but playing through it Syracuse by two Irish with the basketball last three minutes of the first half shot clocked down to four on the drive by Starling in a tough angle thats the first two with the rim for Notre Dame its a great take off the timeout good day Mike pray McDonalds AllAmerican Notre Dames first in nine years oh hes got bounce hes got skill and hes got a bunch of Big Brothers on this team is what Mike gray calls him looking for Edwards again Gerard off the Taylor Bola Jack inside cant finish that and itll go the other way with 210 to go drive by JJ Starling the more you reverse the ball the more you have a chance to attack a closeout look at that tank I dont lurking so knotted up 3232 Applause Notre Dame is six and one Syracuse a disappointing three and four Bryant and Colgate in there as well and cant finish lachesky off his fingertips theyve missed a couple of laps inside they get behind that defense its a good feed thats a great find the chefsky to work in that dunker spot the short Corner area Ryans been playing with more confidence today hunting his shot a little bit more as hes doing here blocked by Ryan though no whistle clean play probably not a good decision right there Works around and out back to him Goodwins the open shooter yes what a triple the one thing that Gerard has had to adjust to is getting the other teams best defender thats what Mike gray considers about Cormac Ryan lengthen that matchup Gerard a little short that time Williams has knocked out of his hands and a blocking foul big Collision here before mid corn as Hammond Music Hamilton Gerards chests trying to go one on one against a longer Defender theyre having success in the paint and it leads to a transition opportunity you know Notre Dame loves those transition threes they all have the green light for that that would have been a very difficult catch it rolls free into the corner in mid town trying to take advantage of their own size you know youre trying to get the ball in the high post there you heard coach Greenberg talking about that and I think the Syracuse Zone has done a good job of keeping the ball out of that area mince around the back starting getting ready to check back in for Coach Bray heres Gerard again yes sir with a threepointer you know hes got to have some cop some confidence thats not an easy shot right there Applause coming off a big zero against Illinois and in this game seems to have relocated that shot I think this goes back to what you were talking about this is a much more confident in it Im not worried about his technique muscle memory the ability to selfcorrect I mean you shot the ball a billion times its the quality of the catch its shots hes been taking thats not an easy shot thats a contested triple and in this gym when you know that youre not going to see someone whos going to be in your face chasing you the whole game gives you a chance to get organized and get get free from outside the yard lead change its in the game four out of eight Jim Boeheim and Syracuse fans its a big sigh of relief there I think yeah I mean the last year buddy bayheim got the top Defender right and and Joe was more distribute find his shots locate relocate on the perimeter now hes getting the top Defender Stephanie if youve heard this before but Jim Boeheim can be very candid about his players one of the things he talked about Gerard was okay hes not getting shots hes not hitting shots when hes open hes not taking them whatever but he needs to do other things too like a McNamara would do for example in that position in order to help the team and Music playing off the ball is really important for a shooter so accelerating off the cuts changing your pace on different screening action you know how are you working to get yourself open and some of those other things or make somebody else better and just by your acceleration even not just the basket cut for a shooter Dave its the exit cut its how quickly you get from rim to the threepoint line it changes the space and makes makes it easier for your teammates to play the game entertaining half and its going to end at 3535 Notre Dame and Syracuse would not be shocked if it comes right down to the last shot as we go to Kevin Connor Seth Greenberg and the bonds with the ESPN2 halftime report Ill be a total of four fouls and that briskly played first half here welcome into the half Syracuse and Notre Dame tied at third and snap a threegame skid theyve looked a lot better here this afternoon at South Bend Indiana so set for the second half Syracuse to check it in Ryan stays on Gerard defensively for Notre Dame well now theyre going to run a double at Edwards mints going in strong and good one with a foul first adjustment of the second half for Mike Brays team theyre going to look to Double Jesse Edwards on the Block Syracuse ready for it great cut on the back side by Mintz mints on a Powerhouse Oak Hill Academy originally he committed to Pittsburgh but he reopened his recruitment about a year ago and chose Syracuse and Jim Boeheim ranked the number 48 player in the country two in the state of Virginia by ESPN Music well theres no question he has a high level skill hes got a high motor as well his decision making early its tough for a freshman with a schedule theyve played Joe Gerard adjusting his role this year as well does not lack Charisma or confidence Music no one should lack confidence if you put the time in and you put the Reps in Garland squishes that one in for Anthony remember he was nicked up had to leave the floor in the first half for several minutes but On Target right there they continue to drain the triples nine for 19 and Notre Dame by two heres Williams will step back that was sweet Danny Williams with a bucket the 69 sophomore thats his first basket a good one against Colgate 178 rebounds Music they swing for Ryan down on the low block now inside for Goodwin way they move it so sweetly Starling just cant finish it and a whistle and inside the lane but 1850 to go here in the second half and knotted up at 38 you know for Notre Dame its all about the ball movement Starling gets just south of the slot get a lot of Threes out of the slot you got to go a little South because of the way Notre Dame plays on the top of that zone defensively you heard coach Greenberg talking about defending the corner three lets see if theres an adjustment by Syracuse here in the second half Gerard wants to fire it up there youre strong Goodwin cradling the rebound Notre Dame pushing it for Ryan Wise Choice with Jesse Edwards lurking around the rim mayheim is going to get Justin Taylor in here in just a moment hes at the scores table yeah he played well in the first half I thought he moved well without the ball took good shots Music same spot on the floor in the zone Boyd is so tough beyond that Arc arent they 4138 I mean its five players they can shoot the three really well flipping back awkwardly there Williams that got scary see if Benny Williams is okay and as he went backward hes now up on his feet and seems like hes okay back to Trey wurtz a moment ago Music works doing a nice job getting in that area right between the bottom part of the zone and the top of the zone Music to go strong up no short down he goes as he draws the foul already weve had almost as many fouls in the first couple of minutes the second half as we had the entire first half nonshooting foul so Syracuse to check it in foul will go on words Gerard off the inbounds got it you can practice it you do it in the game Im telling you its his organization before the ball gets there his acceleration in his screening action Music Gerard back to life offensively five for ten a dozen Music decides not to shoot it Gerard plucks it away set a couple of those in the contest and hell lay it in Applause his defense has been very helpful yes it has and you you know when the ball goes in there you know that theyre going to be digging in from behind so you got to make a quick decision when you catch the ball inside around that nail free throw area in the ACC and scoring it just south of 17 points a game and he shoots 55 from the floor for a 610 guy shout out first half well Edwards again and that time he will make it its shocking when hes down that low and he doesnt make the shot the way hes been going hes getting uh quality catch and I like the emphasis out of the locker room by Syracuse I mean theyre playing with great energy got outstanding basketball body language right now doesnt look like a team thats lost three in a row yeah they dont Starling back out to where its got to get a shot in the air with a shot clock winding down Edwards with another rebound Dave heres the problem with that possession and the Ball State on one side of the floor the whole time you cant do that against the zone its right around and out flipped his head back in frustration there because thats one he can roll out of bed and hit like 10 times whistle stops it with 1601 to go in the second half Syracuse up by one point Notre Dame with another foul although theres been a rarity here thatll go against warts the bench and talking with Jim Boeheim the Syracuse fans wanted to see him play more minutes last year but when you talk to the coaches they told you look you got to earn that time in practice thats right and were not in practice every day Hammer short range no Goodwin missing on to tip heavy traffic Edwards harassed him I mean look at the activity of Jesse Edwards and run into the other end wants to go to that paints still fight now he ducks in the police had a great game that sequence right there shows why hes so important to what Syracuse does moving forward in the league as 20 to lead all scorers he has been the man for Jim Boeheim today Syracuse by three Music getting some minutes for the first time this year were number 10 for Notre Dame to transfer launching Starling and stuff down I Music I like lubins activity Off the Bench as well change is what they do from a rhythm standpoint because hes not a guy thats necessarily going to step out and shoot threes hes one for seven outside the arc on the season good rebounder at 13 Bonaventure Adventure a little Jack over the top once again triggering number 14 for two more they just have not had an answer for him all day its just a lack of size on the inside and this is a small lineup on the floor right now for Notre Dame when you take lesevski out at 6 10 they become small very quickly hes had a terrific season Music mens and hes about ready to come back in but hes been a nonentity today Gerard weaving his way draws three Defenders tipped away Syracuse will keep it I think Goodwins dad Damon Goodwin

win trying to keep it going after Michigan State Syracuse really scrapping desperate for a victory and to come into a tough place like Notre Dame if they can pull out a win huge for the program the way things are right now you definitely can see a sense of urgency out of Syracuse here especially the second half Ryan on the reverse snow moving cant finish and now whistle and it goes and hell be at the line impactful Off the Bench today he knows his role he gets inside hes been a tremendous rebounder for them gets on the offensive glass theres the foul and one opportunity freshman from Orlando two for three at the line in the early going this season threepoint play that was a big moment for him and for the Irish to tie it at 48 the other thing too is Jesse Edwards has played every minute of this game and he does not have any fouls so as the game goes on he gets more aggressive at those plays at The Rim defensively flares out Notre Dame has been unable to keep that entry pass from getting to him flipped up the shot wont go would not have mattered anyway but a shove as mints got hit so the Freshman takes the contact Gerard will check it in second half here in Notre Dame another tie weve had a bunch of them is bouncing for Edwards gave it up and they turn it over so thats the second time they brought the double the first time no South Syracuse scored the second time they turn it over so the Irish trying to retake the lead theyre looking for a hot hand where its using the screen around the back spoiled by mints you got the hand on it so a game that was incredibly clean in the first half has been a little less so here in the second because you have a tremendous shot Blocker in the back row of that zone you can start to leak out and youre over help you dont collapse as much you stay wide thats how you get deflections thats right gets it off fast and that was the key there twopointer very quick release by the senior from Glens Falls New York whats up hes been a different guy here than Jim behind this afternoon in South Bend the Kickball 1548 so Gerard has sprung to life offensively and the orange rough by two Music okay so with the awardwinning Geico

and scoring inside out thats a fun matchup to keep an eye on its been a fun match up here this afternoon from Purcell Pavilion at the Joyce Center here in Notre Dame its usually a really good game between these two and this ones following soon shot clock is at two Hammond gave it up Goodmans got to launch it and it would not have counted anyway didnt touch the iron in any event but a shot clock violation of Edwards and Gerard 38 points the rest of the team only 12 but its been enough to this point for Jim boeheimer I mean its punch counter punch its detail right here right youve got to you make good decisions youve got to execute at a high level its really commanding the ball every time in that lane can they get it to him theyve done a great job of that today Gerard looking up at that clock and lets it fly he mounted Away by Lubin whos crashing that glass well he didnt want anybody to bring a screen because he liked the matchup that he had and I think those are the kind of shots that Coach Boeheim wants him to seek and he is doing a lot more of that today turn around and a roll in by Goodwin nice touch Music Applause time this game has been timed every once in a while against the zone you have to score in there you can play through there but if you dont score in there you dont make them respect that part one goal battle for the board moving again he is racking up the rebounds for the Fighting Irish Music Applause Music Hammond a three Syracuse with the board in a tie game under 10 to go slip there by mids gets his footing back Edwards on a high post Music Applause what is that getting inside and a nice move for two theyre not going to get a lot of offense from him so its gravy thats right and you see they dont bring the doubles to that match up and thats a lot of size on that back row 6 10 and 6 11 right now for Syracuse karmic Ryan the star of the Michigan State win getting ready to check back in on the back door theres a little bit High over everybody top of the zone no ball pressure hands down Clear Vision to the back of the defense 52 long Hammond getting the chance to chase Gerard you got to chase him off of everything you got to stay on his hip events tried to bounce feed shot clock at seven Gerard directing traffic wants to make a move on the spin he sticks it oh boy what do you have nine points in the last three good score in the last game against Illinois shooter shoot man Shooters have to shoot hes feeling very confident right now really isnt looking to shoot too its not turning down those open looks in these created shots for himself his Hammond got a great look on tipped out and whos got the Basketball stand this end for the fighting Irishman 8 18 to go Applause substitutions coming on for both sides started six out of nine from three now theyre for their last 17 pulled off Roger Ayers has a flop call on the floor a technical one shot thats the new rule no warning there so thatll go against Syracuse so itll be a good one to shoot it and hits that Applause so the warning is gone this year and you shoot one shot I said no contact flop and thats right its a I like the rule I like it I think it has removed flopping from the game seems to be working early on I think its working one point lead for Syracuse Notre Dame trying to get back on top here Music a very fast moving game here at Notre Dame when you put somebody at the freethrow line it pulls Jesse Edwards up heres some backside opportunities weve seen Notre Dame get behind that zone several times looking for some separation been tough for both sides to get that Music Edwards up top here to swing it for Taylor Gerard catches fires Edward snatching a rebound second effort back out to mens Music he goes around the back and a shot yes wow that had a little Pearl Washington ah sure good reference to the great Pearl Washington going in the Ring of Honor along with Jim Boeheim saw Pearl do that so many afternoons Golden Days inside the dome in the great days of the Big East I flipped and off the fingertips alumin Syracuse by three under seven minutes to go look at the acceleration change of pace by Gerard Williams good luck no can they get this guy going Ryan is coming off 23 points couldnt miss in the first half off his fate thats a twopointer got it very nice by Dan Goodwin play off two feet shot fake pass fake good job attacking the closeout from the top feels like theres no way this game doesnt come down to the last shot right right Edwards to the paint and lost it the second half adjustment to double him has worked for Notre Dame the Irish can get back on top on his possession Music Applause Goodwin tried to make a very difficult pass and it did not play Applause Justin Mintz says I got a little something for you right here boom off the

off the front of the iron and its Edwards having a tremendous game he can just go vertically where no one from Notre Dame can get Music Syracuse trying to break a threegame losing skid Gerards been in the thick of it on his dribble going up against Ryan they have five to shoot it the kick the youngster will try a threepointer but mints cant hit him really good defensive possession by Notre Dame now

for player of the year last years player of the year for Virginia Tech 66 very skilled so here 3 40 to play anybodys game Notre Dame had a 2723 lead with about eight minutes to go in the first half last time the game has not been with him three so this point and the jump shot wont drop by starling Cormac Ryan on the top of the floor seems to be an issue with a clock again yes yeah the second time in the last almost 60 seconds or so Applause threeminute scoring drought which with all of these shooters doesnt happen very often for Mike gray you know what Dave I still think the ships lechevskys going to have an impact on the end of this game he has been quiet one for five he came in leading five Irish players in double figures with 17 clock did not reset so three and a half minutes to go and the coaches will call their guys over for a little chat 5855 Syracuse Music take a look at the clock coming back after that last shot Music its resetting to six and not to 30 itd make it a very fastpaced game format but were not going to some teams put 12 on the shot clock in practice that way I dont think either one of these teams ever consider that never Applause has been a fun game and its been exactly what we anticipated in many respects you came on here talking about Jesse Edwards and the potential for a big game and Gerard in a really good Shooters gym you know getting back on track again thats exactly whats happened for Syracuse Notre Dame has gotten some outstanding play on a good winning company but lately been a lid on the basket hey coming up at four oclock Eastern over on ABC rolls on number 22 UCF number 18 Tulane squaring off for the AAC title and finally ninth ranked Clemson taking on number 23 North Carolina that is the ACC Championship game if you have not gotten the look at Carolinas quarterback Drake may it ought to be a Heisman finalist he just won the ACC player there offensive player of the year hes just a freshman but only in that regard in every other way he looks like hes NFL ready he is fantastic give a little shout out to Dave Doran in NC State for the great defensive job they did against the Tar Heels Music Daves a great coach yes he is so is Mac Brown Dabo Sweeney going headtohead against Max Tar Heels should be a heck of a football game sorted out theyre gonna put 28 on the shot clock 5855 ASU with the ball Music and withdrawn the double mens trying to jump inside and works for the personal hit him on the way see thats a really good decision thats a good time theres a little dig as soon as his Defender turns to the Post he cuts to the basket play GG smiling the Freshman back in words will step out where its one of the four grads in the starting lineup for Notre Dame and Starling is the Freshman Edwards a power move right over the top of the iron so you got I think Jesse Edwards is better when he just makes a move around the rim not put it on the floor and try to create Applause hes been so effective all game catching in front of the hoop Music practice Dave Mike Bray said it 15 times patience against the Zone theyre really going to need it here but now theyre inside the shot they are down to one on the fall away barely off the rim by lasheski Music too long there big chunk of time coming off the clock about two and a half to go and a timeout Jim behind 34 showing so the story for bayheim today has certainly been Edwards and Gerard the two seniors who have delivered in a big way theres no question I mean Edward set the tone early Dave he was scoring inside fairly easily against the Irish back row defensively and then Gerard just playing with a lot of confidence he looks kind of like his old self today fair enough yeah I mean you cant lose confidence in college basketball theres not enough time I mean theres not enough games and opportunities to play theres no question Joe Gerard puts the time in in the work ability to selfcorrect and technically he shoots the ball absolutely perfectly now was he getting the right quality of shots the timing the Rhythm all of that today much better performance not just by him but by his teammates to help him get in Rhythm last two tied for the ACC threepoint shooting lead Applause on a cut hes going to lay it in Syracuse runs a terrific play for two what a great setup thats the kind of change of pace in the acceleration that he has played with all game and another time out Syracuse with their biggest lead of the game up 55 Gerard with 20 220 to go we watched Cormac Ryan he is up the line right here its a great oldfashioned vcut man take your Defender up and then back cut him off the weak side theres no help at The Rim very well executed off the timeout I know how much you love good fundamental basketball your eyes lit up when you saw him cutting the basket I just think its a great time right we havent seen him make that cut we havent seen Coach Boeheim call that set you dont do it for 47 years without having something in the back pocket you never play all your cards in the first half and when you know which both these coaches know and have incredible mutual respect for each other that it is going to come down to execution at the end Jim behind 35 NCAA tournament appearances 3420 win seasons teams been in a rut maybe playing their way out of it today but still two minutes to go to decide that works with it Gerard fight through the screen shot clock again down inside five its down to two where its with a launch Edwards another big board and now you got to get a stop you absolutely have to get a stop if youre Notre Dame Syracuse going to take a little time off the clock Music this is where mince has to make the right decision right well I think Gerards going to have the ball in his hands late he should shot clock here he is shot clock to seven off the fake that glances away back to Notre Dame with a minute 22 showing Ryan with a triple coming Applause Up Notre Dame and a timeout and a twopoint game car back Ryan incredible against Michigan State the first half emails six threes save look the shot clocks been a factor right the last few possessions for Notre Dame but because they Advance the ball quickly up the floor they directly get to the paint off the bounce that sets up the ability to hit the trail three because the zone is not organized its a great Push by the Irish in transition Music so theres a look at our possession now Notre Dame has that 116 to go Syracuse with a couple of time odds remaining and Notre Dame has burned through their time Music so this is just about exactly what we expected yes would come down to the last couple of possessions I mean you got six graduate students over there you dont need another time out Mike Bryce Got Confidence in this club right here you have to get a stop thats why you work on situations all the time there is incredible parody in college basketball if youre not ready to execute at the end of the game youre behind now Mikes got a lot of coaches on the floor Music his 23rd season at Notre Dame last year 24 wins for the Irish a couple of big wins in the NCAA tournament too in formal wins thats part of the reason why theres so much trust over there between coach gray and the five young men hes put out on the floor right here that absolutely need to get a stop Music so one minute 16 seconds to go here at least in regulation Applause last time down Gerard whittled down the shot clock and his shot did not come close to going in as we approach one man inside the dribble up against Hammond floats it up there that didnt touch anything Goodwin comes away with it back to good one here comes rebound tips and controlled by words nearly had it picked off 43 seconds to play Syracuse by two that was a big opportunity in transition before they got organized words shot clock down to five Goodman on the drive hes sealed he gets hit and it rolls in he hit the shot on the play with 295 to go tied at 16 Music this is where the majority of the boys comes in and a little Luck of the Irish with a nice roll around the rim how about this story Marcus Hammond the Brad transfer hadnt played this season until today and he stands on the line with less than half a minute to go and he has given the Irish the lead 6160 Applause and Jim behind a timeout where to go Ryan immediately looks at Roger Harrison says hey check the clock there should be he wants the clock to be looked at right how how good is that for your veteran guy like the understanding time and score in a late game situation Music Applause so less than half a minute to go Notre Dame with a onepoint lead Marcus Hammond explained his MCL in the previous point did not start today gets into the lineup eventually and boys he made an impact yeah thats it you know for Coach mayheim uh last time they came out of the timeout they got a back door cut right Notre Dame has played only mantoman defense I dont think Mike Bragg would switch it up at this point now but it is something that you consider obviously when you call time out but these guys know each other so well from the Big East days into the ACC Im definitely trying to get a piece of the paint right here Im trying to attack the rim I want to get to the paint to put the def the deficit on Notre Dames defense if you can its been a great game for the 611 senior from Amsterdam lets see Edwards on the glass and then the scoring column he showed Gerard just to be careful right here I think hes had enough set up to Rodriguez so here we go Notre Dame has the possession arrow Syracuse puts it in through judamitz big line up on the floor watch for an offensive rebound Taylor had a whistle off the ball stops it at 189 Notre Dame with a foul to give one more good one Applause gets to go on the drive minutes he will get it to go on a tough Drive with 133 showing and Syracuse back on top 6261 so the Freshman got the basketball made a tough shot coach behind not happy about the clock issue obviously what a take off the bow aggressive to the rim Notre Dame doesnt have any time s left this serves as a timeout for Mike gray to organize his guys offensively big play for the Freshman Judah Mintz Music attention you know Syracuse with a few fouls to give too right no more timeouts and they set it in 142 Music you got to be strong you got to attack you got to get to the rim youre getting over penetrate against Jesse Edwards in this play Music gonna crash the glass Vince with the shot of the day but Notre Dame of the basketball here in a moment and here we go Hammond and fouled by Gerard stops it at 104 still have another foul to give two more Im trying to inbound this pass right here a direct feed to the block I want something in the paint because that takes away theres consideration about fouling right here plus you get it get a good Pawn to catch inside its right out and Torrance now in for Jim Boeheim this gets it in for a good one and another foul Taylor with 93 still have another one to give Music Syracuse by a point down to the bloody end in this one back for words and a reach by mince in a foul 71 so whittling away precious seconds there Music floor will be Benny Williams at six nine four size four length Music six foreign Applause to Ryan Ryan to drive it and the corner Goodwin has to launch it up there he cant hit the shot and thats it Syracuse hangs on for a big win 6261 they beat Notre Dame here in South Bend for a team that had lost three in a row they played with a ton of confidence they started early with Jesse Edwards on the interior he established the Baseline and then Joe Gerard looks like hes back what a game
