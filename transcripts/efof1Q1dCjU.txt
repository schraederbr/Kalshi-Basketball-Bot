streak wake at home undefeated this season the deakes have won 41 of their last 46 at the Joel and its Louisville who controls the opening tip were finally getting the motorcycle smell away from us now inhale the fumes Josh Huntley Hatfield setting the high screen for sky Clark and the rebound pulled in by Hunter sis starting lineups fourway Forest whoy Miller the central Michigan transfer the teams leading score cam hildr who has it now in a bit of a shooting slump and they told you about Carr the career high 28 last time out a big key is going to be the start that Louisville get the issue with Louisville has been their starts those segments they cannot get down against wake because wake can score a bunch in a hurry wakes leading the conference in leag games and scoring threepoint shooting and field goal percentage free throw percentage Carr guarded by Zan Payne thats the son of Louisville head coach Kenny Payne Salis lines up a three and its go you know we talked about that to coach Payne in the pregame just about again the start and a lot of its just some breakdowns defensively they cant afford that and then wake gets a great start right there Im coach Forbes I love that first three to be able to get us going to get our confidence going Trey white back in the starting lineup he was hurt came off the bench the last couple of games Mike James shooting 56 from three in League Play and then Huntley Hatfield the Tennessee transfer four double doubles on the season did you see there now Wake Forest doubled quickly onto the double there Andrew car came and they called a monster with a lot of times on the double team big to Big its they call it a monster and thats what they did theyre going to quickly double on hun Hatfield all game long hes been averaging almost a double double over his last eight games from the corner that one goes thats Trey white one of the most coveted transfers in the portal in the off season and going back to Huntley Hatfield I think hes accepted his role hes really try to be do his damage down by the blocking which has made Louisville a better team against sky Clark with a reach in second team foul on louville at your point br Huntley Hatfield who came over from Tennessee last eight games hes been a double double guy in a league with a lot of good big men hes become one of them yeah and thats what Louisville needs and hes I thought earli in the year he was playing too much trying to force things on outside the paint hes really bought in about being by the paint and doing his Dirty Work by the block offensive rebound off the tip here comes hildr just six of his last 24 make it 25 and the loose ball hild D gathers looking for help good ball movement Carr lines it up doesnt go in the rebound to James those 5050 balls underneath there wake force was able to come up with that they were lucky Louis V you got car got a great look in the corner three those are back Breakers if he makes it but credit to to Louis will come up with with the stop so much been transition transition defense is going to be a big deal for Louisville today how about Carr showing off the shakes finishing off where he came from NC State on T on on Wednesday night look the biggest thing for for for Wake because of their perimeter players you put so much emphasis and focus on it you can lose a guy play Carr who has the ability to score oh he knows hes got the mismatch there Zan pay doesnt play a whole lot making his first start of the Season here Here Comes HRI blocked at The Rim thats Trey white James the other way pulls from the Baseline and hits thats where wake is at his best in offensive transition Huntley Hatfield with a great shot block but then Louisville gave wake kind of their Taste of their own medicine and offensive transition with a great pullup there by James afteron Reed the Gonzaga transfer was setting the screen Carr wants it down low as you said he recognizes the matchup as does wake but are they going to try to force feed it in there to get him the ball Louisvilles done a nice job defensively shot clock down to two Carr puts it up front rim they really want to get car more by the block where thats really more of the matchup Advantage he has more so than on the threepoint line against against pay yeah never could quite get it to him down low Louis BL did a nice job squeezing the paint High arching shot no good by Clark Hunter Salis the Gonzaga transfer thats a three its his second to three and its eight four we an again its offensive transition its breakdown offense it goes from a Miss shot to the way theyre getting back Louisville has got to build the wall quicker and stop the ball higher youre seeing wake trying to do that here bopy Miller coming out to the logo to press Applause Clark James around hildr boy he has been playing extremely well of late did have a little bit of an off night against North Carolina prior three games averaging 23 per contest you know sometimes the midrange shot that elbow shot people say either a three or layup but James is a really good 15 16t pullup jump shooter youve got to let him take it hes making it this guys pretty good at that to Hunter Salis and I think hes got something to prove the end of that NC State game Tuesday picked up two questionable technicals especially the second one he was ejected from the game it really changed the final moments of that game NC State went on to win a game that they had trailed most of the way and know for Steve Forbes youve been in this spot you dont want the ending of that game to beat you twice no you can see James are again from Louisville another great pullup but youre right the I thought in the second half for Cy State on Tuesday they lost their composure the first half they were so good and in the second half they just they didnt they didnt play well they didnt play together hildr didnt have a good game at all and they lost their composure Salis did and then as you mentioned I think he wants to prove something that Ive got to I can bounce back from a tough game and what happened on Tuesday night Curtis Williams getting ready to check in for Louisville hes been playing well of Late Captain Reed guarding Huntley Hatfield and hell give him that shot and if you notice Carr was about to come on the monster or the double but he waited cuz Hatfield Huntley Hatfield was too far off the block he was waiting for enough take another dribble closer to the paint hildr for three he had been one for his previous 10 from Beyond The Arc looking to shake off his two lowest scoring games of the season and as you mentioned Salis want in making a point for this game pilder the same thing cuz he was he did not play well against NC State and wake needs FFF to play really well even more than the scoring just his toughness other things that he does that doesnt always show up in the Box Score white over the big Fon Reed for the bucket when youre playing against Fon Reed whos whos one of the best shop Lockers in the country you have to be so good in the paint on how youre playing off the box and at The Rim based on his shop blocking ability thats going to be a thing to really watch this afternoon on those drives against Reed he got into foul trouble against NC State as boy Miller SS the three and we saw the wolf pack just take the ball to the basket almost at will 50 points in the paint in that game well thats been a thing with wake they cant afford Carr and Reed to get in foul trouble theyve had foul trouble issues and I think part of the thing there with the double there you see the points in the paint again thats when the thing with hunt Huntley Hatfield I think wake thinking wakes thinking is lets double so keeping Reed out of foul trouble but youre right North Carolina State really tore him up in the pain Fon Reed will try the three that one doesnt go 3 for 13 now from Deep on the season and inside to Brandon Huntley Hatfield theres your monster double hes got to get rid of it got away with the skip good recovery by wake James in traffic Reed snags the board and Coach Forbes knows this like they need Reed on the floor to win and to protect his his foul issues thats double and right now its been effective when I talked to Steve Forbes yesterday he said the message to read was simple basically what you said stay on the court avoid the silly fouls he picked up a couple of silly ones early on Tuesday you know right now Louis had a good start theyve made some good shots theyre hanging around theyve had a good start which is obviously is a big emphasis for Coach pay you got to think teams are getting tired were past the under 16 were past the Under 12 weve yet to have a mediate timeout havent had the whistle these are young guys they can hit they can play 20 straight minutes without a break these are young guys they can handle it there youve got to be in great shape and great cardiovascular condition to be a great basketball player these guys have it we have blown through two mediate timeouts just have not had the Whistle the refs are letting them play and its been a clean game right now its been a good basketball good clean game by both teams Trey white hits the jumper so you know the whistle coming when the the refs need a breather yeah well these these guys know it but heres the thing both teams right now you can see theyre kind of huffing and puffing but so much of about basketball to be an elite player you have to be in great cardiovascular shape and right now I think both these teams look like theyre in good condition and its been clean good ball rotation Salis his third triple hes got 11 already he might get to the third time out before theres a we might get to the under eight without our first whistle but the again really good ball movement thats what second half for NC State Wake didnt have good ball movement that was great extra one more and theres the whistle theres the Breather theres oxygen yeah absolutely and you can see right there everyones getting there got a chance to to catch their breath but you can see here the extra ball movement the one more pass to the corner for salad and nothing nothing but bottom of the net when youre great your game does the talk in the ACC our speaks Vol three of the last eight NCAA championships 99 NCAA tournament wins since 2015 eight NCAA

in his second season as Louisvilles head coach and season one was a rough one they go 4 and 28 last year nonconference was bumpy you look at the league record one and five they had the road win against Miami but then when you talk to all the coaches in the league they say listen we know what their record is theyre playing better this is an improved team whats different yeah theyre actually theyre theyre playing much better theyre improved its hard when you cant score and the reason theyre improving is theyre scoring better you look in the last four games theyve shot 36 from 77 from threepoint range which is almost 47 in conference play theyre shooting almost 40 from three the bottom line is theyre just shooting the ball better which when you score more and youre scoring at an easier rate things look better and thats been the biggest Improvement of why theyre playing better at this time but you know they still need to stop those those margins where they have those three four minute stretches where they go score less Trey white makes the first free throw and that triggers the Under 12 media timeout we blew through the under 16 the Under 12 just Mak it up for L time

wake team looking to get to the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2017 theyve had reinforcements in nonconference they got F to Reed who was deemed eligible today its the first game since February 22nd of last year for deari Monsanto he had been out with a injured left Patel attendant tore it last year a season ago 13 points per game and one of the very best threepoint Shooters in the ACC hes on a pitch count about 10 minutes today youll see him if he can become a factor down the stretch boy it gives this team another offensive weapon yeah his ability to shoot the ball and stretch the defense people gravitate towards him I mean the amount of gravity that he pulls hes a big weapon for Wake fours to have now itll be interesting to see can he really get his rhythm back its been over a year since hes played Parker Frederickson has been the sniper Off the Bench with Monsanto hurt hes a freshman from Bixby Oklahoma the one thing about wake is that they are such a good threepoint shooting team and they got so many weapons youve got to really take the three out of against him and with these guys coming in theres no drop off from threepoint line foul away from the ball on hery Miller just coming off of a screen there thats just a basketball play just a just a bump but you saw the last time Louisville tried to came out of that timeout after the free throw in that 221 press to try to slow wake down well now if youre Louis defensively youve got to be aware of how W can spread the floor youve got Frederickson youve got Monsanto that creat space for someone like Salis yeah and just the spacing it stretches everything and here he goes mons Santo hits the three his first shot his first basket of the season and this demon Deacon croud loves it if Im coach Forbes Im really excited about that and if Im coach Payne youre a little bit in danger zone right now in the in the stretches that we talked about they got to be really careful on this in these next 60 seconds to 90 seconds on how they keep it within single digits Curtis Williams cant answer rebound Monsanto wake 7 for 12 from three through the first 11 minutes of this half Frederickson make it eight of 13 and Kenny Payne wants a timeout this is that danger zone moment you talked about absolutely they got to be real careful out of this timeout its going to be a big deal for Louisville to make sure they draw something up to get a basket Applause hey I think I have a fever I dont feel so good Music either this is not just 1hour delivery this is not just Music medicine this is fast relief for those who cant take a timeout wgre L Steve Forbes now in season number four here at wake bars a couple years ago they win 13 games in the conference yeah cant get to the NCAA tournament he hes done an outstanding job hes an outstanding basketball coach they should have been in a tournament a couple years ago and and so instead of the last time they were in was 2017 it should have been whatever it was 21 or whatever that was but 22 but theyre theyre theyre really really good hes hes his teams play hard heres the other thing they get those great transfers and hes hes a magician to be able to get him to play so well together thats Caleb Glen The Freshman for the hammer yeah and and great call by Kenny Payne out of the timeout they needed to score to stop the bleeding thats been an issue with Louisville the amount of shooters that wake can put on the floor when youre talking about spacing with all these shooters on the floor its almost five outs it is five out and you saw Salis took it to the basket wanted the foul didnt get the call Ty Lord Johnson The Freshman point guard in there for Louisville almost has it poked Applause away James over hildr too strong Brandon Huntley Hatfield on the putb hes got an advantage against Keller inside and this is the deal where Louisville they scored four consecutive points now this is about stopping that bleeding and theyve done that right now with backto back baskets and a good timeout call previously by coach Tay Out of the atto Keller he can knock down that shot raises the rim we saw it against North Carolina the other night

January the Leagues biggest teams the games brightest stars I got on it cheting shot like me wide open NBA Wednesday on ABC Home wake averages 8 and 1 12 threepointers made per game already at eight with s and 1 half to go on the first half whats the point of shooting twos if you can make all these threes but the ball movement has been outstanding by wake heres the thing seven assist on 10 made field goals theyre not making any twos really its all been threes and the gravity because of the amount of Shooters they have on the floor and theyre finding the open man I thought the second half for NC State they did not find the open guy the the open man sort of the goto man they did not do that in the second half for cc state right now the ball has great movement energy and Rhythm and thats why they got seven assists on 10 made field goals awake weirdly eight of 14 from three just two of seven from inside the ark good decision by coach Payne to go right back into huntting Hatfield you can see the Monster the double they came to get it quickly out of his hands good game plan by coach Forbes Caleb Glenn meeting resistance if you notice they had Keller in to be five out with five Shooters he missed the three coach Forbes is out Reed back in he got Reed and Carr back in Frederickson the only nonstarter into the game for Wake Salis the cutter Carr from the corner and how about Johnson getting the rebound over Reed and theyll get Reed with the foul and those are the fouls Steve Forbes does not want Fon Reed to pick up he his possess his positioning there on the offensive rebound he was behind him he didnt get foot Advantage kind of the the terminology slice advantage or youre wedging the guy he didnt get there and then Johnson was able to get there defensively sticking his nose in there guard rebounding good play there for Louisville to continue to try to cut into the pull up by Tyler Johnson a top 100 freshman and hes got two shots coming Frederickson picks up his first foul that defensive guard rebound sticking his nose in there by Johnson those are the plays that help you win because then you get an extra possession here offensively coming down this direction and you get foul so you get two shots those are the plays that they got to continue to have and theyve winning those 5050 balls those loose balls those are big plays in order to have a chance to to win featured ESPN womens basketball matchup for tomorrow afternoon is LSU the number 10 team of the country against Arkansas coverage begins at 5 Eastern on ESPN do you have any sequin Blazers like Kim M shes a much better dresser than I am in fact I I saw the other night or I think last night she was wearing like a tiger yeah on her sweater Im not Im not not as cool of a dresser as she is thats for certain Frederickson with the three the Sharpshooter from Oklahoma almost 95 of his shots this year or threes they got car into the Post Louisville came for a double and really good pass out and recognition by Carr and he threw a strike it wasnt a high or or a low pass it was directly into the shooters pocket and nothing but a three for Frederickson Hunley Hatfield against Reed whos got the foul and its knocked out of bounds really good fundamental defense by Reed there not to go for the shot block you can see stays down he usually going for the shot fakes look at his Walling up to stay down did not go for any shot fakes and that allowed him not to pick up his second foul the NCAA ruled him eligible before the game against ruers he had a double double in that first game and Steve Forbes said afterwards he raises the ceiling for this entire season and theres times when you watch Wake Forest with Fon Reed in the lineup they look like a sweet 16 team well hes a Difference Maker and they went nine straight with him and but if you notice right there on the drive in the kick to Huntley Hatfield Reed was out of position smart decision by him not picking up that foul because as you mentioned they need him in the game they were so much better with him on the floor Carr able to draw the foul on Glenn if you right now whether it was starting with Payne on car or Glenn on car they are really trying to attack that matchup in the block from Wake onto Louisville thats a that thats a mismatch that that wake is trying to take advantage of and car just needs to keep hanging down there because the more he drifts out you you kind of give Louisville that opportunity to to to take away that mismatch the danger is you send help for car you got have to read down low who are you helping off and you have great Shooters all over the floor just on the perimeter so its a hard situation to be in you got to kind of pick your poison on that uh you know got to find the Josh passner fun house with trick mirrors you got to do some Zone here some Zone there some junk defense there to kind of mix it up a little bit I Music guess thats just what makes wake so good is there so many offensive weapons you just cant take out one guy you know A lots made they dont get a whole lot from their bench as Johnson missfires their starting five is so good and those are the guys that Steve Forbes is going to rely on to score and if you get a guy like Monsanto or if fredericksons hitting shots well theres your bench production Reed almost lost Applause it four Shooters flanking Reed right now Miller on the drive too much dribbling and its going to be out of bounds but last touch Louisville five to shoot 5 seconds on the shot clock late clock wake for Steve Forbes really good in base out of bounds late clock actions heres Carr using the shot fake sets and Applause hits threepoint shooting is such a Difference Maker in the game of basketball and when you have a guy like Carr whos 610 I mean hes 610 and hes such a good shooter it just makes such a difference for your team wake has 10 threes in this opening half white banging against hildr and gets the bounce hildr is a really good Defender he uses his chest tough hard nose hes fortunate that he didnt get an and one there because he did get lifted on the shot fake good basket there again this is youre right in that double digit Louisvilles got to keep it in single digits going to halftime these possessions are humongous for Louisville Reed the face up jumper if Im Coach pay Im living with that shot thats that Id rather him shoot that than the way theyre shooting the free and an offensive Applause foul its going to be an illegal screen against Glenn Andrew Carr picking up where he left off Tuesday when he had

can the 2024 NHL Allstar Weekend February 2 and 3rd on ESPN ABC almost 80 of wakes points have come from Beyond The Ark you know what in coming in this game they were in conference play they were they were about 50 under 50 on made field goals assisted so this is just the way theyre playing right now I think the team has got their message from coach Forbes about ball movement Rhythm flow energy do not let that ball stick its almost being like a hot stove a hot potato you touch it you move it and and and and thats kind of how they played and theyve gotten great looks they havent been for shots theyve really moved the ball and a and they got no turnovers thats the second thing when youre moving the ball like that and youre not turning it over thats why theyre making these threes and give great looks nine assists zero turnovers for Wake these last three and a half minutes feel critical for Louisville critical is probably an understatement is could make or break the game for Louisville and this is where theyve had some issues they need to find a way to keep in single digits going into halftime if this starts getting into 15 16 17 what happens at halftime these guys are still human being you you you lose that energy and you can come in there and raw ra and fire him up but you know its its its happened so many times its like oh here we go again this 325 is going to be just critical for Louisville to try to hang and stay involved in the game their leading scor sky Clark just went to the bench with two fouls and thats the first turnover of the game for wake and if Im coach Forbes Im disgusted because weve got him right on the ropes ready to bury him and we instead of having a shot at The Rim we give it away by an unforced Music error Louisville does not have a threepoint Basket in this half attacking the paint Johnson feathers it and a rebound by Reed if you notice Johnson hesitated for a split second cuz he saw Reed just Reeds presence made him think for a quick second being able to play at the blocks in the paints against the Heat is so important for Louisville Music offensively Salis a game high 11 he launched punches and the rebound by Trey white that wasnt their best of look of a three that theyve had this half Johnson on the drive and the nice drop off to Brandon Huntley Hatfield thats what Louisville needs to do downhill drives get to the paint make Reed have to make a decision he he attacks got to the huntting Outfield gets a basket how about boy Miller hes so good off the bounce same thing like we talked about James earlier from Louisville about his midrange Game Boy Miller is able to play in that midrange game as well too its not just three in layups with him he can play at that midrange 15 16 17 ft 13 12T as well James attacking the paint over Reed who didnt want to pick up that second foul its in his mind Reed I I Ive got to be careful I think hes got coach fors message stay on the floor just your presence alone but really good vertically and violently attack by James at The Rim T to shoot 90 seconds to go opening half Miller against Johnson Drive kick hildr its batted out by Reed and we get a whistle underneath its going to be against louiser if you notice there on bofy Miller on the drive because of the shooters and he had hildr to his left well James was guarding hildr and James came over he started out in the positioning but as the drive came he then came in which allowed hilders for the open three they were fortunate he didnt get that look but thats the gravity that Miller has you because not only can he shoot the three hes really good at driving and getting to the paint Fon Reed a terrific free throw shooter now 19 out of 22 on the season thats a great re advantage to have when youre starting sevenfooter center can shoot free throws like this yeah hes been a game changer came over from Gonzaga you can that you know when you shoot free throws like that you can have him in at the end of the game in close game situations and get him the ball in a press break situation yeah wake is one of the best free throw shooting teams in the country James out of control Here Comes wake far spy Miller leading the break attacking Johnson and bopy to the free throw line where hes made a 27 in a row again offensive transition wake is as good as any team in the country when they get going an offensive transition they get a defensive stop and then theyre Off to the Races and theyre hard to stop in defensive transition when you were not back and set and building a wall they got so many weapons all over the floor NFL playoffs division round it starts today in Baltimore the Texans led by their rookie quarterback CJ strad will take on former Louisville Cardinal Lamar Jackson and the Ravens I got Lamar as my MVP hes had an incredible year and what an incredible player Story how he has you know talk about even have an agent I mean its been incredible and he and he bet on himself and its worked out I was rooting for him and I agree I I do think hes the MVP thats going to be a great game today by the way two really good quarterbacks CJ stra put together one of the best rookie seasons of all time another foul here this one is on Miller two free throws coming for Louisville so right now youre in this youre down 14 with and and wake wake can play two for one depending on what they want to do you know so look it doesnt look like Louisville is going to get it within single digits going into half but even just if they can keep it around 12 or so but theyre going to have to make free throws to do that you just dont want to start getting 15 or above going into halftime based on the whats happened to Louisville all in the past theyve been showing some fight you go to the UNCC game on Wednesday they were down 17 at halftime cut the lead to five a couple of times in the second half but then ran out of gas North Carolina pulled away this time poy Miller Blows By the def defense the lead is 15 about a 6sec differential between game clock and shot clock and boy Miller just picked up his second foul two things there wake wanted to go for a two for one you see they just pushed it hard up the floor got a quick basket coach Forbes tried to call timeout Mark Schnur the referee did not see him so they didnt get the timeout he wanted to get his defense set up because he wanted that two for one didnt get the timeout which then allowed Miller to get a second foul I think he wanted to get Miller out of of the game initially on that timeout but they didnt give it to him sixth team foul on Wake next one will put Louisville in the bonus nice move by Trey white on the inside and now wake can hold for one Steve Forbes has the lose it or use it timeout hes not going to use it hes not going to let Louisville get set up into their defense big big possession defensively for Louisville right here going into half Salis got Huntley half field in the air and knocks down to Jay As Time expires that caps a 13point first half for Hunter Salis yeah actually with good defense better offense when youre making threes like wake is and youre guarding the three like wake is thats a recipe for Success poopy Miller and thats rebounded by Brandon Huntley Hatfield eight points three rebounds for the former Tennessee B this start for Louisville here is going to really be everything these first minute or two just to make sure they dont get themselves dug too deep of a hole where they cant come back out of they get an offensive foul on Huntley Hatfield his second not the way you want to start for the cards no that actually thats their second time hes been called on a moving screen not having it set when you set a screen youve got to be shoulder width apart and youve got to give the defense a full second before you can set the screen on the contact teams have their original starting five and that means Zan Payne is in there Andrew Carr wants it down low he likes that matchup lets see if Louisville helps Carr backs down Payne hes good defense by Payne and Louisville was probably saying hey let him play in the two weve got to stay at home and take out the three we have to guard the three we cant overh help anywhere on the floor long two goes by Trey white remember against Carolina on Tuesday or Wednesday Louisville was down 17 at the half Trimm the lead to five as cam hriff gets inside they did trim the lead and they and they did a good job on that but you see right there in transition offense after a made basket how fast wake flew it up the floor and and they got a quick basket Louisville did not get their transition defense set theyve got to be better in transition defense Mike James draws the foul on Reed but you can see here the speed after a made basket wasnt even a Miss theyre so good in offensive transition and then on the other end here Reed got his foul if you notice he got lifted second foul he went for the shot fake he really goes for a lot of the shot fakes and early in the first half he was really doing a nice job of staying down but he got lifted there and and and the ref call him for a second foul if youre in Kenny pays shoes whats your message to your team going into the second half well I think number one is we got to guard the three guys we weve got to find a way even if it maybes not with our principles defensively in the half court we going to have to stretch out more we cant overh help we have to take the three out and then secondly weve got to keep finding ways to drive the ball into the paint and try to make Reed have to make some decisions great ball movement and car hits the three you said it earlier these threes are coming off great ball movement and they open shots and good looks I didnt mean to cut you off but I was just about to say it all starts with guarding the threepoint shot you cant overh help they got help in the corner there from the ball side and theyre getting too good of a looks wake force is too good of a shooting team with the looks theyre getting James thats a long two Mike James the teams leading score in conference games at 16 A2 you look at the points in the paint Louisville is is smashing its almost irrelevant though but its irrelevant when youre getting up all the threes after get Reed out to Salis look good when he shot it if you notice there on even on Reed the direct strike that he threw to Salis it wasnt High it wasnt low hes able to throw it right into his pocket the hand activity for Louisvilles got to be better to help not allow those Shooters to get picture perfect opportunities of looks at the three yeah theres a reason wake leads the ACC in scoring a lot of weapons on the floor its one of the best offensive teams frankly in the country Carr using the height of manage on James and Mike James picks up his first thats the danger part with weight is is because of their shooting on the floor and heres Carr getting into the Block Youve got to stay at home everywhere else and then youre just on a oneonone coverage and he gets to the free throw line as a coach thats got to be a catch 22 do you help out when they go inside risking the ball reversal in the open three or you know are you content to let some mismatches play out down low well whats going to be interesting is as Monsanto plays a little more and if they can get Frederickson to even continue to grow in his game and they move Carr as we have talked about to the five you literally now have five Shooters cuz right now the only one on the floor that cant shoot for Wake from the threepoint line is Reed you eventually move car to the five and you put another shooter you literally have five highlevel Shooters at every position James too strong on the pullup and then it gives guys like bopy Miller and Salis room to operate inside extra pass Miller Baseline head fake traveled the only thing is when you do go to the five out if you do decide as a you know play defense I was going to say read the one thing with having Reed not on the floor defensively hes such a presence in the paint there with his shot fock so that is a little bit of a give and take on that James for three Louisville still without a threepoint basket now 0 for Applause Applause four Reed to a cutting car big to Big outstanding offensive execution cutting is such a skill and an art that sometimes lost great speed on the cut by card fin by Reed hutley Hatfield over Reed at the other end and they thats what Lou theyve got to live in the paint if theyre going to have any chance to crawl into this game back besides taking out the three defensively theyve got to live in the paint offensively no whistle Zan pay wanted the foul its too easy for Fon Reed and Wake Forest lead is 17 its largest of the game Clark the pullup rebound hildr and you feel this might get away if Louisville doesnt make a few stops hildr twisting and pretzeling inside Two Shots coming

seen your face before my friend but I dont know if you know who I am Louisville fans might have a rooting interest in this one Lamar Jackson look at his Heisman numbers in 2017 at Louisville look what hes done this season with the Ravens he already has one MVP on his trophy shelf and a good chance to add number two after this season whats amazing I wonder where he was like ranked coming out of high school I mean heres a guy if he wins another r i mean hes probably going to Hall of Fame I mean to think about it like I wonder does anyone they see that come out of high school was he highly ranked recruited I know he went to high school but he wasnt I dont think he was recruited by all the socalled Blue Bloods of football you know well leading up to the NFL draft there were teams that asked him if he would be willing to change positions which is wild its incredible I mean there there were NFL teams who didnt think he could stick at quarterback NFL NBA hockey Major League Baseball they spend millions and try on drafting and trying to get it right and they still get it wrong thats why in college basketball you still get it wrong at times because youre hoping on a four four or five phone call and seen a kid once or twice are you going to be right Trey white and that is Louisvilles first three of the game again for the Cardinals they have not been able to cut into this deficit wake forests lead still 15 hildr throws that to the bench in order for Louisville to look theres no 15point shot so in order for Louisville to get back within Striking Distance theyre going to need to make a couple threes theyre but theyre going to really the biggest thing is theyve got to get stops on the other side of the ball and that helps right there again thats another unforced turnover by wake and that drives coach Forbes up the wall you can see them going right back inside the Huntley Hatfield right in the Applause paint Carr hes been so good off the shot fake leans in and Andrew Carrs got 15 to lead the decks hes picking up where he left off for Cy State and I mean again the speed in transition to get his feet set to show the shot fake that is an easy and then the drive down gets the guy fly by him gets his feet s gets a basket about the fly by by Clark everything but the bucket Reeds presence even though he didnt block it his presence affected his shot at The Rim thats why its the do you have him out for defense offense thats thats the issue James the steel Williams the trailer James does it himself well thats why when you look at the net rankings and you look at wake forests place right now in the NCAA tournament picture Joe lonardi has wake as the last four youre telling me this team potentially going to Dayton anybody wants to play them and the round of 64 the round of 32 the reality is is Carr knocks down another three this is a different team since Fon Reed was eligible theyre what nine and two theyre arguably the third best team in the ACC yet net rankings dont take that into account no but thats why theyre going to say well the committee of the human beings and the committee yeah it might not show up in the computer rankings but thats where the committee of humans there you go James with the travel shuffled his feet there thats where theyve got to recognize that to say okay theyre a different team with Reed now look you look at it where lonardi has them last four in I mean their margin of error and margin of right now is zero because even a win like today its it might move them up a little bit based move you down it could move you down because its a quad four game now margin of Victory could come into play but you look at next week theyre at UNC an at pit two Road opportunities they need to try to get a split next week if they want to move up in lardi rankings and try to give him a little bit of a breathing room yeah the only teams right now in the ACC that look like anything close to locks are North Carolina and Duke and what youre essentially telling the rest of the league if you go off these net rankings which again can be gained if you schedule Pat Seas at home and beat them up by 40 50 points because margin of Victory does matter and League and teams have done that youre essentially telling the rest of the ACC hey your path in is dont lose to anybody except duok or Carolina and this league is too good for that to be the point of entry well look I think and and lonardi hasnt been in there I think you know Clemsons really good you you Im here watching wake I think theyre a really good basketball team look I know Virginia has some has some ups and downs Miami is still talented like ACC still has the opportunity get a bunch of teams in its just Im hoping the people that are watching the ACC understand basketball this is a really good basketball league thats got a lot of offensive Firepower these these teams can really score up and down this conference yeah I go back to the tournament last year Miami against Houston and I dont know how many people gave Miami a chance Houston everybody talked about their defense that game wasnt close well and again you know not only are these teams they they got they indiv they got individual talent but the ability to score the speed and thats why you look in the past the success that the ACC has had in the NCAA tournament has been as good as if not the best of any league right now in the country in a historical matter over the last couple years you call games around the country in a lot of different leagues its very easy to make the case offensively there may not be a better league in the country right now than the ACC well you know look theres a lot of speed and quickness and athleticism but also a lot of ability to shoot and score in this league and the spacing in this league makes it very NBA is if that makes sense just on the nice basket there by by again by Jame and you see them getting to the paint theyve got to live in the paint but again its a very NBA is league in the sense that theres a lot of potential Pros in the league but also the way the kind of the styles of the league of the type the teams that play up and down and a lot of Monsanto 13 threes for Wake is season High first game back and deari mon Santos chipped in with two triples heres my question for you are we getting the is W going to get to 20 today are they they are they going to get to 20 May threes what do you say 13 out of 23 Im going to say no 20 is a high Mark especially with the margin of 20 one we get a foul on Glenn well step aside the deaks putting on a shooting Clinic 59 from the field 57 from three theyve hit 133 from downtown when youre great your game does the talk in the ACC our speaks B three of the last eight NCAA

one of Joe lardys last four in with a 21point lead wild shot by James who slow to get up and the Finish Onan the put back by Glenn heres deari Monsanto open three the guy doesnt play a game in 11 months comes off the bench and hes three for three from downtown his addition gives wake and Steve Forbes another chest piece and were not talking about a pawn here no hes hes the way he shoots and just again the gravity that he puts on the floor because of his ability to shoot it but heres the other thing just the energy in the building wakes energy to today on this noon game you can just see it from warmups they were locked in from the first three that they made to start the game its just spiraled upward for them all game long yeah the announcement came yesterday Monsanto cleared the play so was Jiao atuka the Maris transfer whos hardly played in two seasons with wake due to knee injuries atuka is a guy you might see today as well Steve forb says he can give you some pretty good on the ball defense Salis left it a little short point lead thought he got hit right there lucky didnt get a foul Curtis Williams the three no good if Im coach Forbes and wake like youre up 22 dont play the scoreboard weve got to continue to play the right way play hard do things we need to do sound defensively and offensively dont play the scoreboard you want to make sure you finish the game the right way and well get a foul its going to be on Glenn thats three you can see just there the nice follow back up on the dunk there that second chance no one got a hit on Millard came untouched there for the for the duck but thats the way Louisville is going to have just again they theyre theyre little past danger zone right now but just to kind of continue to keep it re it back in to keep it with respectable range Salis a near turn over its another three 15 made threes by wake you didnt think theyre going to get the 20 Im telling you they might get the 20 that was a significant over under that you set 20 Im still going to hedge but you see there the loose ball the ball got kind of Knocked around and then it finds Salis right right into his shooting pocket thats when you know things are going well for you 15 of 25 from three thats absurd you know you look at Louisville theyre shooting 48 from the field theyre not playing bad offensively I think Louisvilles playing well theyre doing a nice job theyre theyre theyre theyre theyre one of their better games right now is in terms of just theyve been sound in a lot of areas theyre scoring in the paint defensively theyve had no answer just defensively has been guarding the three has been the issue they just have not guarded the three and and theyve gotten Great Looks wake all afternoon long thats been the biggest issue in Wake to their credit has made the shots Monsanto will try it again are you kidding me four for four from downtown first game back from a torn left Patel attendant suffered last February against NC State you can see him call Mon Santo needs a sub yeah hes got to get his game cardio back up but hes calling for a sub Wars wants to leave him in say they keep keep shooting the way youre shooting but hes got hild coming in for mon Applause Santos Keller picked up the foul and two shots coming for the Freshman Curtis Williams averaging better than 10 a game in conference UFC 297 tonight from Scotia Bank Arena in Toronto the main of that the middleweight title fight its sha Strickland the champ and a rising star drias Dy main card begins at 10 Eastern on payperview I mean Josh come on the guy hasnt played in a game in 11 months comes off the bench four for four from three three sports thats why you play the game its a funny game basketball is a funny game you just dont know its so much about the feeli the flow I I I use the word energy you can see Louisville kind of in a 131 zone now just trying to change the pace or something to stop letting him get open free Monsanto camped in the corner catch release and he finally misses the entire crowd hes ready to erupt if he made that one against the 131 those slots and corners are open to give you a chance to get open threes Donal yovanovich down low for Miami hed been starting or Louisville he had been starting for a couple of games hes a Miami Applause Music transfer Miller to Keller thats too easy Louisvilles in the extension of the 131 get spread out and then you can see right here on Monsanto I mean this is just unbelievable hasnt played in basically a year the GU right there hands are right there hits it thats basketball this

job of taking care of at home they got a great crowd great atmosphere and this week and I mentioned it earlier at North Carolina quick turnaround on Monday and then at pit they need to get at least a

hey you got to watch this Im watching oh oh Im watching might Applause be now on Sports Center another wild Music night Music Applause Monsanto who hasnt literally played in a year in game action almost a year in 8 minutes has hit four threes you can see these threes hes hitting all over and it gives an added Big Time dimension for Wake Forest here just a hand in his face and just makes it this type of addition at this part of the season is a huge advant Im when I talk about huge Capital hu g seven exclamation points to be able to get a shooter like that at this point of the year theres an old saying the fox has many tricks the Hedgehog one good one monsantos got one good one and boy it can play if he can just come off the bench be a 15minute guy the rest of the way and knock down threes it gives Steve Forbes another element and another scoring option yeah it just opens everything up the spacing on the floor it just is a big difference you can see right there Wake Forest actually is going five out with five Shooters on the floor they up turning it over to allow Louisville get the break there but again you can see theyre theyre looking at the five out situation right now to have five perimeter players coach forward is probably thinking hey we got to now prepare in a sense for Monday night against Carolina let me look at a lineup or two just to see that and in case for Carolina to have to prepare for something different when Reeds not in the game poopy Miller in the paint lot of head fakes almost a 3 second violation well speaking of Monday that is the first ESPN big Monday double header of the season its UNC and awake at 7 Eastern Carolina leading the ACC Bott RJ Davis Harrison Ingram has been a really nice addition as is Cormac Ryan the glue guy coming over from Notre Dame and then Kansas at home for Cincinnati well great opportunity for Wake on Monday night its all you can ask for the opportunity a quad one opportunity but theyre going to have to be better guarding in the paint CU you know Carolina with Bott and what theyre going to do and even though this afternoon Louisvilles you know having their way within the pain is in terms of points and the paint wakes not going to be able to rely I dont think night and Night Out hitting 16 or plus threes game in game out and let me just say this on lopy Miller you saw that up and under in the constant fakes they do such a good job wake teaching that they did that with applebe as well too getting into the paint shot fake shot fake pivot fake getting in the air they do a good job of teaching and developing in those type of areas in the boxes and the paints with those Applause guards Miller at 21 on Tuesday Carr at 28 in that game a loss to NC State with some questionable officiating at the end you see their five out but theyre putting car in the block now and theyre going a car hes more comfortable car facing up on the three threeo line than he is maybe with his back to the basket so I think theyre going to try to see can they get him more comfortable a little bit with the basket with his back to the basket so they can use that five out lineup with the five Shooters on the floor off the turnover Williams off the Tyler Johnson feed and he hits the three you know since theyre look just by human nature they have the lead theyre probably playing the scoreboard a little bit and heres the other thing because of the five out they Lo Reeds not in there they maybe havent his rhythm in in sync and you can see Reed coming back in theyve had some turnovers in when theyve gone at a smaller in a sense or car at the five they havent been as effective and or as Rhythm based with car at the five at this for this game yanovich its not there and remember early in the season before Reed was a part of the equation at least on the floor you saw a lot of the five out offense but theyre way more theyve been way more affected with Reed in so thats thats the case for having read in the game K getting some minutes today cant finish and Louisville is going to find they just want to continue to find a way to score here to keep chipping into the best that they can look that was a good shot they had a good Baseline drift pass there one more got an open three the key now is going to be transition defense Miller out to Hil the extra pass that one does not go for Carr offensive rebound Keller hildr this time will fire too strong you see there got Miller in the post playing post defense and hes doing a nice job shuning hes given up a lot of size Carr came out there on the high low by Glenn Carr did not have his hands up on Glenn him a direct line pass on the strike an and one opportunity for Dono yovanovich on the other side 8260 Wake On Top of Louisville NBA

game Lis Gos not coming back wakes winning the game the key on Coach forb you want to finish the right way play the right way you want to have a good feeling going into the game Monday in vers Carolina that you that you finished the game the right way you played it for the most part really good Monsanto hit his first four from three follows his miss Sally drops it off to Reed unselfish basketball you could set that to Mozart it was really good basketball and the offensive rebound to get the second chance there for mons Monsanto to be able to do that and then they didnt just settle on the three they had Louisville closed out hard they attacked overh help by Louisville on the drive kicked to read for for an easy bucket Louisvilles got hery Miller Thats Masterpiece son and xan Payne had coach Kenny Paynes son in the game is knocks it in from down low and to Louisvilles credit theyve got they look its 19 the leads 19 and and people might say well its still a lot but they they didnt let it just spiral to get in the 30s they theyve kind of hung around within the and its not a moral Victor or anything but its enough for Kenny Payne to talk about okay weve had some stretches and were still playing hard were getting after were competing theres some things that were that were doing that I still like that weve got to clean up on our threepoint defense now Kenny Paynes team has Duke coming up on Tuesday Wake Forest with that big Monday game at UNC theyll make the short Trek to Chapel Hill and Louisvilles upcoming schedule daunting you get Virginia at Clemson Reed knocks it down and that is threepoint shot number 17 for Wake Forest that is the most threes made by an ACC team this season and when Fon Reed is knocking it down he can knock it down only his four three of the Season you know its that kind of day when he does that am mon Santo who hasnt played in basically a year is hitting these four threes youre Kenny Payne youre like time to go home it just is what it is thats just the bottom line how you can look at it thats when you smash the face shield yeah thats when you smash the face shield you kick the scores table and you say guys lets just head on home and get a good meal and be ready to go but you dont follow the referee out no no I did that last year I did not like a call by them at the end of the game if we if they had called the right call I would still be coaching I wouldnt be sent here next to you oh weve enjoyed having you theres poopy Miller the Up and Under School record for threes in a game for Wake by the way is 19 theyre at 17 with a minute to go they got to 19 back in 2002 against Clemson on the road I said they were I thought they were going to get to 20 and theyve had good looks and miss them I just think that they played the scoreboard they got maybe their arm got tired this is Salis thats Applause 18 its just been an incredible display of threepoint shooting all afternoon threepoint shooting covers a lot of sins in basketball do when you can shoot the ball like this 18 out of 34 hery Miller from long range and looks like Steve Forbes did he call a timeout get a quick he did theyre going to bring on the walk on Brigade the human Victory cigars here at the Joel yeah and look these are the Feelgood tight for everyone to get an opportunity to get in and you can look at wake schedule here coming up like this Ive said it numerous times today the the the the the this next week at North Carolina on Monday then at pit I mean this is a huge opportunity for for Wake because its a row game then youre coming back home Syracuse at Georgia Tech whos been a really tough out Dam stmy done a great job there and then you got NC State who they just hadnt lost to so you look at this stretch here a lot will will be kind of the telling of the tale for for Wake as we move forward in these next two to three weeks yeah they came into this game again as one of Joe lardys last four in and right now the projected field for Joe only includes four ACC teams and one again at the very bottom there with wake Percy Miller trying to split the D how about the block from the Applause backside Kevin dwn lets it go at the horn that would have been 19 and Wake Forest cruises to a 90 65 win best scoring offense
