and we will retry our opening tap here Ron Grover Justin Porterfield Kellen Milner your officials as we play Afternoon Hoops in the ACC out west the month of March commences here in Maples Pavilion with the Mustangs and the Cardinal SMU put 81 on Cal Wednesday night up in Berkeley the second best scoring offense in the ACC as Matt cross dials it up from deep and lifts the L off the scoring well this is a confident team you want to look at a team that plays with confidence SMU is one of them raino and Blakes two of the three seniors that were honored pregame highlight the starting five for Stanford Rano flashes the leather now backs in yu he shows you how versatile he is he can score from free so you grout him make him put it down and he gets to the to the rim just does a great job of taking what the defense gives him SMU again with out their leading score bopy Miller who continues to miss time with the foot injury the hope is to get him back for the regular season home finale against Syracuse next week but SMU despite Millers absence they still have five guys active that average double figures yeah its nice to have that kind of backup and support Chris SMU and Stanford both firste members of the ACC Stanford coming from the opack 12 SMU coming from the American conf chck Harris takes it down the lane sweeps it across and the extra pass to the floor as time dwindles on the shot clock and the possession arrow points the way of the Cardinal well thats a very good possession defensively for the Cardinal they did a nice job of staying grounded staying disciplined and as you mentioned theyre playing against a team that averages double figures each guy so they really have to be good at not trying to stop one player been playing solid team defense SMU has won straight away from Dallas 7 and one in the ACC in True Road games very impressive what theyve been able to do under their first year head coach Andy nfield as raino gets slipped up it pops out but hes headed to the free throw Applause line well watch again Maxim rold with Mar out of moves hes got you now you get a bump and he spins off to the Baseline no help Baseline side so hes forced to foul but he kind of want to help and push your Defender push your opponent to the Middle where you got a little more help but Maxine was clever and got to the Baseline side and now hes getting reward hes got two free throws near 80 on the season from the free throw line Kyle Smith his first year head coach talks so highly of Maxim Reno not only as a basketball player but calls him the most talented human being hes ever been around the computer science major math Miner and hes got the first four for the Cardinal on Senior Applause Applause Day mid post yigu draws two Edwards floats it turkey T night Inside by Raina sers off the heel and taken by Applause SMU welcome to ACC basketball on the west coast from Maples Pavilion its the SMU Mustangs and Stanford Cardinal Matt cross knocking down his second threepointer of the opening minutes with Coach Ben Brun Chris Sylvester our entire crew SMU they find themselves on the bubble this is a quad two opportunity for the Mustangs against the Stanford team thats 152 in this building well huge opportunity for SMU if they can get it done aawk Applause finish I dont think Isa sellers car as much about the smus opportunities now thats a big time move by sellers on the opposite end sellers who played under SMU head coach Andy Enfield the last two years down at UAC raino the B fake and the finish off the glance and a timeout yeah good timeout by IND the infield he wants to stop the momentum all right well step aside twopoint lead early for Stanford on the ACCC Network Music injured player not a timeout as it turns out so quick stoppage of play were Applause back Harris steps into the elbow jump shot and its taken by jayen Blakes yeah great challenge by Maxim Reno using his 7 foot frame to challenge that shot chokar off the Stanford bench loses the hand and Harris in transition lays it in well if youre Stanford youve got to get it back in in numbers SMU will really push the ball in transition 80 plus a game and a lot of those come off of defensive rebounds turnovers and transition baskets SMU without ex leading scorey Miller maxo rips the courts from Deep its senior day dont think he doesnt know that his parents in here from France and hes putting on a threepoint exhibition already hes got nine of the the first 11 Stanford points on a perfect three for three from the field Matt cross the veteran 24yearold senior with a sweeping Hook off the window and in well hes been good early hes three for three and hes been on Fire Two KN knockdown shots and a tough shot over Jaylen Blakes whos a very good Defender cross transferred in from UMass First Team all a 10 last season with the Minutemen and its a return to the ACC for cross who had been with Louisville and Miami previously aara backs him in on this end shot clock into single digits Jaylen Blakes the Duke transfer as it knocked away another steal for SMU now nice job by SMU theyve been very active with their hands theyre a much improved defensive team under Andy Eno just outside the top 40 of the net at the start of the day around college basketball other bubble teams have already had some poor showings here on the first day of March o queno thats a deep one and they come St short nice challenge by agerwal C doing a good job of challenging early you have to because SMU can shoot it Cardinal have open four of six on this end sers off the side of the Applause backboard SMU beat Stanford 8561 exactly one month ago in Moody Coliseum back home in Dallas BJ Edwards and a foul on the floor before the attempt will officially take us to our first timeout of the afternoon oh well you got to you got to like Maxim Reno he can find ways to score but if you dont guard him hell queue it up from three and he knows what to do count it Music I had to take my shroud off like all the GES here well into the game because youre excited your par familys there uh you want to you know theyve given you so much and you want to repay what theyve done for you and its an emotional day so Maxim Maro already nine points so far hes handling it pretty well Stanford takes it away from Matt cross out of the timeout agarwall keeps it alive and Ros skips it in for Chisum Oar and it rolls off jell Colbert K State transfer has checked in for SMU along with tiet gorer the Sharpshooter who played the last three seasons about 20 minutes from here at San Jose State I like the activity uh both teams really scrapping defensively but you know if you want to win these kinds of games its not just going to be who can outscore somebody you got to get some stops Chris and these teams are capable defensively both teams excellent uh on the defensive end Benny geler is also in for Stanford out of that first timeout Chuck Harris Tak him inside and flutters it in hes tough he can do that oneonone youve got to get a little help there but he he can get in the paint and go over the top of you Harris matched his season high with 21 and Berkeley on Wednesday night Reno has nine of Stanfords first 11 and his first Miss comes off the front rim to BJ Edwards to bet gorner catches and lays it in thats the second time that SMU scored in transition hey hey hey ponies have strung together six straight points to go up three here on the road early Ryan aeral knocks down the three he can do that hes a threepoint shooter when he gets in Rhythm hes got great range his 34th tray of the Season Stanfords second triple of this first half on their home floor h 9 of them here on Wednesday night in a win over Boston College Edwards out to Harris with the shot clock into single Applause digits off balance jump shot almost banked it in Tapped around comes back to Harris and last touched by SMU well you see how tough SMU is to the rim Stanford caught a little bit of break there ball going out of bounds but youve got to get a body on and you got to keep people in front of you the hardest thing to do in college basketball is contain oneonone so you got to be a pretty good health defensive team and stay grounded Stanford now with Reno really getting off to a great start well try to play through him if Music possible Stanford has already won four more games this season than they did all of last year as REO puts in the South CL flip well thats the recipe for Success you put the ball in his hands good things happen you double hes a great passer youll get threepoint opportunities you dont double hell make you pay second leading scorer in the AC behind Marcus Burke of Notre Dame J Blakes throws it down on The Fast Break Andy infield wants to talk things over a senior day stamp for the Duke transfer but how about Maxim REO you put the ball in his hands hell drop you off at the street corner and score on you but if youre Jay and Blakes dont give him an opportunity highway robbery for two coaches and T Kurt Carris he says you know coaches players love playing for him he gives his players so much Freedom he builds trust but he HS his guys accountable thats why his teams have been successful at every stop and he firmly believes that this SMU team belongs in the NCAA tournament right now Joe lardy has them as a next four out team but still some time for the Mustangs to make some noise and add to the resume late in the clock here out of the Andy nfield timeout CH Harris has to launch off one foot and the tear drop falls through well thats a tough tough make at the end of a really tough possession Stanford defending well but again good timeout by an infel settling his team down and then coming back and scoring two to narrow this game Chuck Harrison his second year at SMU after three years at Butler Reno a slingshot three and its taken by Edwards oh Harris had his pocket picked numbers for the Cardinal Aiden camon big fella sharing the floor with Maxim Reno aara attacks Corner pot for Benny gayer thats a great look look by chisar losing his balance but kept it enough to find one of their Shar Sharpshooters Benny gler spotting up in the corner for three his 32nd tray of the season the former walkon was held scoreless when these two teams met in Dallas last month Edwards elevates U had it for a moment it is a Reload here for SMU one of the best offensive rebounding teams in the country Yu bends the rim well how about the assist thats a big time look over the top youre trying to stop the penetration of the guard and then you throw it to the rim good job 72 freshman from turkey has scored in double figures 10 of his last 11 games has really come on strong here down the stretch run of the ACC season raino takes him off the bounce and missed everything was trying to draw some contact there going stay with Stanford yeah he thought he got some contact on it but watch watch watch the look of aaro who is falling out of bounds and he finds Benny giler whos a knockdown threepoint shooter and then obviously on the other end you see over the top tremendous contact eye contact and finish Harris sits for SMU Maxim REO will get his first breather for Stanford in the opening half and agar wall juggling the inbound pass turns it over yeah thats thats really good defense if youre Stanford though you got have to have some Avenues out there not many guys open everybody running to the corner and running to the ball good job defensively B SMU putting playing denial Applause defense two veterans have led the way on each side through this opening half you get toou it rolls off big man slow to get back Blake steps into a three AJ George the outlet passed across one more to BJ Edwards who fouled by Jaylen Blakes and hes given a technical foul after the reaction to the whistle bullsh well you dont have much leeway to show emotion after a foul call at this level no even if its senior day you I think he said ref its senior day I come on I I got to be a little emotional but I think Jaylen Blakes just got caught up in the motion hes a tough competitor but missed the shot then didnt really quite get back in transition and then he thought he went up clean with two hands so officials didnt like the reaction Kio Endo well traveled senior from Titusville Florida taking the technical free throws Jaylen Blakes didnt play when Stanford visited SMU last month they really missed him in that game no hes hes too instrumental for them Chris but I think you know Kyle Smith talked to the officials saying look this you let players get a little bit emotional there and know hes youre allowed a little bit of reaction he thought he went up there with really good contact with the ball which he did but there was some body contact but it was the demonstrative reaction that just was a bit too much to the officials so uh play on but tough break Kyle Smith is praised jayen Blakes for bringing a winning culture to this Stanford program spent the three years at Duke was part of an elite eight team last year final four team as a freshman well hes done a great job he was Pack 12 Coach of the Year and he has won wherever hes been Chris he has won at Columbia hes won at USF San Francisco I mean he hes won at Washington State now hes winning at Stanford I mean hes just like Andy infeld two of the top coaches you probably dont hear as much about but theyre great coaches and hes been just reallying money everywhere hes been CLA down the Baseline walled off by two Defenders find sellers he missed everything already five ties and five lead changes this first half o quendo knocks down the three yeah really nice job in transition good floor spacing you always try to spot somebody up in the corner because that makes it tougher to defend and they really rotated the basketball and got an easy look for three that brings Kio Oquendo to 1400 career points gayer clean look he CES it Benny giler thinks its senior day I think for junior day I mean hes hell get it going he can score it when hes open hes got a really nice look from three Edward cant answer back aara claims the Miss Gaylor has a chance to be an X Factor for this Stanford team as they try to make some noise ahead of the ACC tournament they were in the atlarge discussion in early February before a tough stretch where they had lost four of six now the net sits in the low 80s cam backs in yigu out to akara and he yeah nice look for eight from Aiden camon out to his teammate really a much improved shooter Chism ofar is knocking down four freze like its regular activity right a season High 15 Wednesday against BC AJ George on the drive and all at The Rim Yeah nice job by chisen mpar he was beat but he never gave up in the play still managed to get a hand on the ball and block it Reno and Harris getting set to check Music Applause back camon into traffic picked up by cross SMU on the Move Cross Court screws and a finger roll this track meet can continues from the farm no neither team is showing any signs of slowing this game down they both like to play in transition play Fast both shooting north of 50 as K scores off the window good look by Ryan eral nice drive nice delivery right to the rim inside of seven minutes to play in our opening Applause half Edwards wraps it around Yu cannot catch it here comes sers look outow a two hand finish another flush for Sellers and another timeout Applause SMU Stanford sizzling on senior day well sure are and you got Matt cross its able to get to a basket scoring almost double figures but you got on the other end oai sellers who knows what to do with the dunk yeah well they came down to say hi to us before the game theyre so thrilled because they normally watch our games back home at 300 in the morning tape nothing watch it all live but theyre so happy to be here but there were some tears in his moms eyes and as I as you ask me Chris that happens on senior day a lot both teams have shot it well early as oquendos floater wont go trayor TS it Skyward and its recovered by sellers yeah nice job of Maxim Rano just getting up a little taller and keeping it off the glass and off and out of the SMU players hands Cardinal have hit 12 of their first 21 attempts from the field the double team comes at raino agar walls the open man and he passes in very unselfish play two guys rotating the basketball never stuck ball never stuck Chris this is a 132 first put together by the Cardinal cross off the bounce and Ros somehow saved it Applause in sers skips it aara wisely throws it off AJ George yeah Stanford never really had possession that whole that whole possession but every time each player had to make a save they knew how to throw it at least to a white player in a white jersey or off a player in a blue jersey nice job as you can see hokar cant quite get the handle but he said I dont have anybody to throw it to so Im going to throw it off of a Mustang I actually think he was trying to get that to Ryan AG Im going to give him credit okay we see we can we can aggree to disagree but I think he was initially yeah me you might be right R raino across the floor it sets up Sellers and that shooting practice for the USC I know one thing raino did try to put that ball in his teammates hands and he knew knew what to do as well nice job of passing by Stanford sellers admitted there would be a little extra juice going into this one against his former head coach Andy Enfield spent the last two years with Enfield down in Southern California at USC well that happens in our game lead is double figures for Stanford Edwards has to hoist chck clock violation now Maxim REO did a nice job Chris he he just put his hands straight up he didnt try to block the shot you just try to go up and affect the shot very very Applause Music Applause impressive and thats what you do when youre you know youve got a guard that wants to get you out off your feet just go up and challenge the shot you dont need to block it and with a short clock he altered the shot and and I think he was plotted by josea sers thought that was pretty good defense arar slashing inside but dragging the pivot foot whistled for traveling official little warning to the SMU bench like I got that call I dont need any help from the fina Gallery been over there Chris many times and sometimes had to quiet my assistants down they get a little emotional but youve already called One technical so you dont want to be on the other team having the officials return the favor so nice Warning by the officials DJ Edwards finds Matt trayor on the offensive class hit on the way back up Johan trayor also from France 611 Jr third program in three years played under your old assistant Joe Pastor neck at UC Santa barbar yes he did I remember him but you know to see him you know making his Mark now as you mentioned you know players go on they transfers sometimes and they end up playing sometimes for their former head coach that happens it happen with Stanford and and uh Andre sakovich having to face each other a couple times but you know in this game players do transfer and and you know and they get better and you could you you like to see players get the opportunity and and I think coaches start out if they recruited you they want to see you successful I dont think they want to see you successful against them but I think they appreciate your ability to get better or has seen his minutes dwindle over the last month has been battling a hip injury uh hes hes a big player hes 611 235 he Shores up the interior for Andy and field theres no question Stanford North the 60 from the floor this first half Reno cant hit that one yeah its good defense by SMU Harris deep three off the heel recovered by gayen Applause Stanford playing this first half at an uptick in Tempo yeah theyre trying to take advantage obviously if theyre playing without Bey Miller theyd like to push the ball a little bit playing without their floor General l in the clock for the Cardinal cam kns inside and lays it in how about that from the 6 11 forward putting his shoulder down and getting a edge to the rim nice finish this might be the fan of the future for Kyle Smith red shirt freshman 610 from and over Massachusetts and Harris out of control whistle for Traver now good job by the Applause official Stanford redot on Senior Day from the farm 60 from the field and a 10point first half lead over the SMU Mustangs Music Music uh you know thats getting it done thats production and you know you need that in an emotional game uh thats thats got a lot writing on it senior day you just got to have guys step up and theyve got theyve done that Stanford has been very tough to beat in this building 15 and two at home only one loss on their home floor in ACC play play agarwall down the shoot for two great finish by Ryan agarwall at to the rim split two Defenders to get there largest lead for Stanford Cardinal go up by a dozen how does SMU weather the storm these final two and a half minutes well theyve got to take their time maybe get some fouls get to the free throw line as well but theyre doing a good job right there like they getting into the paint uh and and scoring just a good play youre not going to knock down a lot of threepoint shots but get in the paint and pull up hit the midrange eight first half points now for Chuck Applause Harris gayen he it third opening half three and that was from way outside that was from the Tara Vander logo cross cant answer back trayor grabs a second effort igu Harris works it Edwards on a s side step and a bull eyy a great job great Patience by BJ Edwards the junior just did a nice job waiting for the defense to clear and knocked it down big basket for the SMU Benny geler with the big burst Off the Bench three triples nine points for the former walkine Reno flashes it comes up short on the push shot and yigu is fouled by camon well hes trying to plead to the officials that there was a little contact in the last play but you know you got to really like if youre Stanford that Benny geler is now stepped up and just showing his Marksmanship his ability to stretch the floor he makes things happen for his team when he can knock that shot down hes a leader uh hes really an improved player point guard pills in for Jaylen Blakes when hes not on the floor and he also uh you know can be a point guard that that can make his team go hes under great job for the Cardinal Stanford has hit seven trays this first half they only average eight made threes a game no and thats something you know if you give them the opportunity theres a reason why too teams are taking that away because theyre pretty good shooting teams sometimes and so you dont get the looks when youre a good shooting team but if youre Andy Enfield now and youre SMU youve got to close this Gap going into halftime youd like a little bit of momentum you can cut this to single digits you want that and if you can just grab some momentum going in the locker room and the infield Kyle Smith keeping Pace with each other moving over from the old pack 12 Kyle was at Washington State last year Andy at USC Harris sticks the straightway three yeah big time shot again that your your uh SMU and you got the ability Chucky Harris to knock that down thats just with the doctor order now youre putting a little pressure on Stanford to score Harris one of the top threepoint Shooters in the country seven a baseline finish he saw his opening Chris and he got there in a hurry Big Time finish but a bounce displayed by sellers this first half o quendo quiets the home crowd with a downtown hit well somebody forgot to tell SMU that to go away theyre not going away theyre theyre theyre answering shot for shot so now if youre Stanford you going to probably play the entire of this shot clock and leave SMU with a very short shot clock coming back but you can pretty much much play wh this thing down uh and get the last shot before yeah before SMU comes back that make brings the ponies back up to 50 from the field gayer heat check oh it deadened off the back iron almost rolled in SMU can hold for the final take o quendo on the attack and W for traveling before the attempt obviously if he jump stops hes probably going to get a chance to draw a foul but lost lost yeah lost his footing but well see when we come back stord with the ball and a short clock Music raino doesnt know its his b well hey the ACC womens basketball tournament is on the way its coming up from Greensboro North Carolina the Ally ACC womens basketball tournament it begins this Wednesday first and second round games as well as two of the quarterfinal matchups right here on acc Network final seconds of the first half and sellers put too much on the three and team raino hands and makes somebody else teach you SMU closed that first half on a 92 stretch see if the Mustangs can carry over some of that late opening 20 momentum to the start of this second half a team thats launched just once all season in conference play on the road as yigu gets hit and free throws on the way for the 72 Frost from Turkey well theyve go did a good job of getting the ball inside they were very patient Stanford doing a good job on the ball Street defense blowing up the screens but then when the roll took place its hard to guard 72 so youve got to get an extra Defender raino and deer out on the ball but somebody else got to slide in and try to bottle him up yigu had missed the first couple games at the beginning of the Season waiting for NCAA clearance averaged the double double while playing with a professional Club back home in Turkey last year was a late ad in Andy enfields first off season with the Applause Music Mustangs SP as Achilles has struggled a little bit from the line but you know hes a big player you can run a lot of your things through him hes hes tough only three points so far for yigu who averages close to 11 the game theres a foul on yigu trying to cross blades with Maxim Reno in the mid poo I was talking to coach Eric re know the veteran coach from Stanford hes asked him why he thought Maxim was so good he said hes been really coachable hes worked hard in his position hes made it tougher now to guard because hes holding his ground hes using his lower body not his upper body to get open jizmak par came off the bench that first half starts the second on the floor Max Maro picks up where he left off yeah how about the no hesitation youre a step late Chris and thats what he was defensively SMU was he just knocks it down no hesitation from Max REO Benny gerler also out there for Stanford instead of Jaylen Blakes EO disrupted inside loose ball cars back to him and now geler whistled for a reach in foul well that was a much better job though just the fact that it went inside again to the sevenfooter but chiso par was there on the catch to disrupt it and dislodge the ball but Sanford ended up committing a foul nonetheless but much better defense on the post interior AAR exits Aiden camman the 610 forward back in for Stanford Edwards finds cross in the corner going Baseline raino disrupted the attempt U there for the Loose Change and the follow well he did a nice job that was a great move by cross raino rejected it but ended up backing as them Ed hands from two raino has three blocks here on senior day BJ Edwards one of the best Steelers in the country and they will count that plus the foul well Kyle Smith does not like that call hes saying there was a couple of steps right there holy smoke but look at the block by Maxim Reno he said no youre not coming in my house but then theres obviously that put back but here it is theres the step through one two come down and you know I dont know about that one but you might have a case if you are Kyle Smith but they did wave it off thank goodness justice prevails maybe at the next level yeah so no basket for Edwards but he does have a takeaway 20th in the country in steel percentage is BJ Edwards the Junior from Knoxville Music Tennessee cross backs in sellers out to oqu and a foul underneath will keep it on this end with SMU well thats unfortunate for Stanford that was a very good defensive possession for Stanford other than the foul underneath the basket you know you really dont need the foul actually was a foul going against SMU thats what I thought Andy and Andy nfield thought it was the other way around I was confused Chris so so was I yeah well now Andy enfields turned to voices opinion and I think hell get his two in here but now they are lets see now theyre going to say were going to stick with the call any INF wants an explanation oh play on the first half had six ties seven lead changes Stanford built a lead as large as 12 in the first half but SMU was able to trim it down to six at the Music breaki ERS on a skip out to Reno on the drive has it slapped away shot clock down to three saers spins off now Maxine raino thought there was some contact on that last play Fisher letting him play a little bit Applause now Edwards along the end line and he stepped out well I love that defensive uh uh you know action because what youre doing Chris you trapped the ball ball screens and you force Baseline guess what thats a triple team youve got the two Defenders and the Baseline I I think thats sound defense both teams by the way exploiting this this type of Defense but thats a really good strategy a 10th SMU turnover R I love that action high low to guard no help side cam into Reno for the sh two jump hook game high 16 for the second leading score in the ACC Harris catches takes sillers to the glass for two how about that move by Chuck haris I mean the show and go the hesitation and go you defend him on the perimeter and he just attacks you at the ri 5year senior with over 1700 career points between time at Butler thatu not happy with the the last foul call Kyle smz wondering why a technical wasnt div after Jaylen Blakes was hit with W that first half yeah but look at that high low right in there theres no help side I mean youre caught in the inside and I think thats great strategy to go to Maxim Reno uh in the high low I think what theyre talking about the sideline now is there was a reaction that last play and they said look we our man gets a technical how about their guy not a bad point Jaylen Blakes one of the three seniors on the Stanford roster finally back on the floor yeah hes had quite a uh some time off nowo tripped up its another foul on Colbert well thats tough Chris when youve been sitting on Jaylen Blakes have been sitting an awfully long time and you know when you get the technical and you adds to your foul total players need to remember that act tack on an extra foul but can Jaylen Blakes get back in the rhythm of this game and hes been sitting an awfully long time Blakes is third on the team in scoring bro Miss fires from the Baseline Here Comes Chuck Harris and Applause SMU cross underneath camon rips it Applause away aaral High L low post Applause great look by Ryan Ager while he waited he read the defense whos fronting Maxim Reno goes over the top for the delivery hes got 18 Edwards entry pass OK quendo recovers it to Paris block by par Stanford really on top of their game defensively Chris theyre everywhere Ager will trying to feed Roo again this time the entry pass intercepted Harris going coach to and deflected out by Stanford SMU will have it on the other side but the Cardinal have built this laid back to eight you like Maxim raino Dont Front him because hell hell drop you off and flush it on you for Music two I love nothing more than getting his uh player back his Junior back for Action Mustangs hope to get Miller back as quickly as Tuesdays regular season home finale against Syracuse hey the nothing but net crew will be in Greensboro for the Ally ACC womens tournament starting on the ACC Network theyll have pregame halftime and postgame analysis throughout the tournament big shakeup of late on the womens side with Notre Dame losing their last two games allowing NC State to jump to the top of the AC stand you never know whats going to happen down the stretch of the year and thats why this game is so big because this got this has NCAA implications and you want to make sure that you want to be on the inside not the outside oh dangerous pass and SMU picks it off yeah it was lazy that just was a really uh nonchalant pass no need for that wasnt that much pressure on you quendo to the block for cross dispossessed and picked up by SMU Harris stepping inside lobs it for trayor and two more free throws for the big fella well Im so impressed with smus athleticism Chris they make it tough on you and they just theyre quick to the ball they they get to a lot of the 5050 balls you heard about coaches talking 5050 balls but you know it favors the team thats going to win usually gets most of them and smus really quick for the basketball or spin his freshman season under Bruce Pearl at Auburn was a fivestar Prospect coming out of high school all big West honorable mention at UC Santa Barbara last season has provided some valuable bench minutes in this game for Andy Applause Music Enfield but heres a full court press UCS SMU had some success the last time Stanford got very careless with the basketball but theyre going to try to employ this press again see if they can turn o turn over Stanford again all seven second half points for Stanford courtesy of Maxim Reno who leads all scores with 18 in this game ja clock in single digits gayer had three triples that first half Applause aara how about that shot at the end of the shot clock as the shot clock is winding down about to go off Edwards off the hill last Touch by cross well I really like this this is great action by Stanford I mean you get down to the shot clock theres just two seconds to go and I thought as you did a great job fullcourt pressing back into their defense and only having stford play on a short clock but they managed to beat the clock nine trays for Stanford this afternoon sers he rattles the ls outside Maples Pavilion oah sers with the drive and finished to his teammate Maxim REO a 20 piece for Reno 17th time this season hes reached 20 points Harris zigzags and kicks Stanford relentless on this end down to five on the timer and gerer caught with his hand in the cookie J no thats a tough foul Chris because as you said you were just saying describing the action I mean theyre playing great defense this is one of the better defensive games Stanfords played thought they had a brilliant game last game against Beast Boston College but theyre playing really good defense and what do you do you foul with 5 Seconds to go on the clock you just got to stay St disciplined through the clock make your opponents make the mistake or take an ill advised shot or a challenge shot Ryan agerwal checks back in for Benny geler Stanford has stretched this lead back to double figures with 1320 to play Edwards around the high screen Harris has to launch dror another offensive rebound beautiful pass as Harris found CR for two thats why second shots are back Breakers Chris you do a good job in defensive rebound now its Stanford trying to expand a double digit lead now its down to single digits now the pressure is back on stord SMU has 13 Second Chance points in this game Reno has it knocked loose Mustangs on a fast break and Edwards slays it in now dont look now youve got a twopossession game just like that SMU wont quit theyll theyll not go away they defend you they scrap and they are playing without their leader bopy Miller theyre playing a heck of a basketball game four more steals for BJ Edwards too shy of 70 on the season well SMU is in his Z Chris theyre in his own defense and they create another takeaway its Edwards leading the fast break Music again trayor crashing to the glass and draws another foul its on max steam REO no they say akara who is also in the vicinity it was raino with the reaction but arars handed the personal foul well yeah yeah lets look lets look at the the break here is the steel on the one end and the fast break on the other you can see transition basketball smus best friend they really are great in transition well SMU a top 10 free throw percentage team in the country they have worked into the bonus with 12 minutes to play here in the second half that last foul was in the act of shooting so two for tror whos got all of his points at the free throw line today yeah and you can see the balance of SMU Chris they again we mentioned with Miller out where they going to get their points but they they get them they got great balance and it doesnt really slow them down defensively even though Miller is a great defender this team is putting a lot of pressure on Stanford Stanfords done a good job up until now handling until just the last couple of possessions have been a little sloppy and careless and smus taken advantage of it Yan treor 7even for eight at the free throw line back to a fourpoint game theyre playing the zone now smus back to the Zone theyre going to match up and theyre going to play The Zone Andy Andi talked to us before the game said hell play some Zone if he has to arara couldnt quite musle it in C has it on the floor lot of contact and Stanford unable to hoist one up in time its a shot clock Applause Music turnover and the Nels going to talk about it his thatll be on the heels of second ranked Duke hosting Florida State after this one tight one on the farm coach smus defense has trimmed what was a double figure Stanford lead back down to four well they they averaged eight Steals on the year theyve already got seven and DJ Edwards with four of them so thats been a big turnaround on their defense Stanford has given it away six times since the halftime break Stanford in the zone Chris theyve gone out of into the Zone late whistle for a foul after Jaylen Blake stud he had a clean takeway and I think if youre Kyle Smith you might talk about that um Applause Music Applause yeah I I mean that pretty good play might have a point I mean I like the defensive change up to the zone and looked like it created a turnover right off the Applause bat its the eighth against Stanford this half so Tibet gorer whos only taken four free throws all season will tow the line for the one and one here thats a big call that going the other way you got a foul call misses the front end but it Ricochet back to Harris o quendo drives count it two plus one for Kio o quendo Aiden camman had a chance to secure that rebound didnt get two hands on it went through his hands and right into the hands of SMU and they capitalized SMU is now plus 13 in Second Chance points well thats a thats a tough stat if youre Stanford youre giving the ball back to SMU but youre not giving it away as much as SMU is going out and taking it there been a heck of a half for SMU defensively nine straight for the ponies on the farm yeah the pressure is really uh wearing down Stanford and Stanfords got to do a better job of handling it but now theyve got Jaylen Blakes back on the bench Chris keep your eye on on that because have to play without their floor General and best ball in agar wall lets it Fly Reno Taps it out a second effort for the Cardinal zone defense still being employed by SMU agar wall has it knocked out of his hands with 13 on the timer Cardinal havent scored in more than three minutes here Ben no in the SMU is going to his Zones a good call youre going to then keep it out of of Maxim Renos hands make somebody else beat you Applause raino three to shoot Southpaw flip comes up short yeah you can see Stanfords out of rhythm offensively Chris they have not been in the same Rhythm that they were in the first half Harris leans in more free throws for the Applause Music Mustangs again cal Smith not happy Benny giler not happy with the minute contact and the foul call I think what officials want what coaches want Chris more than anything is theyre okay with that call on this end if it goes back the other way and the other and I feel that Kyle Smith is making that point like it hasnt gone both ways um and as a coach I know the feeling its youll live with any call thats made as long as its being evened Applause up right Jaylen Blakes after a short rest comes back for St yeah you cant let him sit too long because this game you know can turn around in a hurry so you got to put Jaylen back on the floor I think thats a good move you take your chances but Stanfords got to do a better job now against handling pressure and getting a good look cuz they got a lot of good looks in the first half theyre struggling to get those same looks this half 11 straight for the Mustangs to take their first second half lead yeah two three Zone playing high in the wings Blakes The Zone Buster but he comes up short numbers for SMU oh qu a finger old finish and a timeout Kyle Smith SMU 13 straight to take a threepoint lead at Stanford said with a game of runs and it is a game of runs ASU with a 130 run going out getting the lead theyre up by three Music second half action in the ACC and on the farm in the midst of an SMU 13 straight for the Mustangs to take their first lead in the second half here well you know Chris theres good turnovers and bad turnovers unfortunately and when our bad turnovers turnovers at number one are unforced and number two they lead to baskets and thats whats happened the turnovers have plagued Stanford in those both those regards SMU is outscored Standford 2112 coming out of halftime theres a defense again zone defense and the infields going to stay with the zone defense been very effective R automatic from that mid post well thats a great look I mean thats thats a great justment timeout timeout by Cal Smith he said look lets get in the high post jilan Blakes was there last the last possession but he put his big fella in there and he knew exactly what to do drained it first points in over three minutes for Applause Stanford quendo on a bounce tryo fouled again free throw attempts 9 and 10 on the way for Johan trayor who has come off the bench and does not have an official field goal attempt in this game because every time hes triggered it up hes been hit no and and thats what he does he gets the ball to basket but thats probably a good foul for Stanford yous going to get a layups you make him shoot free throws but how about the the discrepancy and I call it a discrepancy but its really I think indic indicative of a game Chris youve got SMU now thats going to the line for the 13th time and youve got Stanford that hasnt been there this half and so I think thats a thats thats important if youre Stanford You got to try to get back to the line and keep your opponents off the line well how about the free throw difference for the game 20 attempts for SMU just two for Stanford well thats what SMU does they try to get to the foul line and and and even Kyle Smith says we got to get to the line more so he knows his team you know needs to get there more and and theyre trying but uh this zone defense has bothered Stanford theyve done nice job of keeping Stanford on the perimeter and not letting Maxim Reno get the Music Applause flow deep one for agarwall Blakes Sor is in second chance for Applause Stanford Blakes Corner pop trayor swings around the elbows and secures the miss a high lot mat cross more free throws for SMU well cross did a good job of number one catching the ball and number two drawing a foul great job of patience didnt waited for the defender to come down and waiting for him to get a piece of him but you know the the free throw differential Chris has been Monumental this game because Stanford has not gotten the line and smus making a living there they continuing to attack the basket many of those attacks in transition off Applause Music turnovers hey coming up next Cooper flag number two Duke welcome in Florida State at Cameron indor well have it for you here 700 pm Eastern on the ACC Network and the ESPN app well if youre Stanford youve got to get going now on the other end because youve been really styed but youve got to get your Shooters arga wall obviously oah sers theyve got knock some shots down to open up this Zone a little bit get the zone to come out and guard give Maxine Reno some room to operate you feel like Stanford needs to be more physical here down this I think so you know sometimes when youre playing against the Zone Chris theres a theres a misnomer you say well I got to take outside shots and theres really confusion in the zone you can get to the line you can split the Defenders and you can get to the rim so I think they still got to continue to attack and try to get to the foul line against his Zone Stanford only has two free throw attempts on the night theyre the top free throw shooting team in the ACC oara throws it to the second row well thats the right look though Chris in terms of getting the ball in the middle to aquara he just forgot to square up he didnt really Square his body up he had have done that he could have taken the ball to the basket gone high low or made that same pass problem was his feet were facing the 10sec line and so he never squared up but thats what the zone does it backs you up it gets you a little tentative and you got to be just aggressive and fundamental against it Stanfords now giv it away 12 times in this game good chunk of those here in the second half quendo spins around on sers and it rolls in well I dont know how he got the ball up and over Isaiah cers he was defended pretty well but he just managed some bullyball it up over the top and through well quendo has been in double figures now seven of his last eight knocked away from camon but a late whistle a foul on SMU well theyre going to get Benny Giller back in the the game uh for some shooting but you like a quendo and his ability to get into the paint and just go up over the top of Mah cers thats strong thats action so youve got to get youre as good as your last game youve got to get this one knock this one off and then worry about those other games later but theyre playing with some urgency especially in the second half and the enfields team 2514 over Stanford since the break Benny giler back on the floor with four fouls shot clocks down to five raino lets it Music Fly last Touch by SMU SMU switched up went back manto man but they did a good job of trying to get it out of Maxim Renos hand but then they got down to a short clock and very fortunate that kept keep the ball alive didnt get a good look Stanfords only scored two points the last six minutes and oara reached in on and fouled well thats what Stanford needs to do Chris they need to get aggressive and attack the basket and and switch the table a little bit here get to the foul line and getting the bonus Chuck Harris may have been hit on the side of the neck there as cross reenters for Andy Enfield maybe the right ear of Chuck Harris oar is not a little guy looks like a a freight train running at you at full speed hes strong Rs working really hard for position underneath the turnaround right hand shot over the top of tryo and he was rewarded Stanford found their teammate boy he was working hard for position its good to see his teammates give him a look now Stanfords got to play some defense Chris mom loves it hes got 24 to lead all scores Stanford back within three Edwards spinning gets it back from Cross working on Gaylor with his four fouls turns it over last touched by tryo big stop for the Cardinal yeah how about the Cardinal playing some defense of their own theyre switching up as SMU Mustangs with the momentum defensely now Stanford with a big time stop SP court pressure still being employed by SMU maybe not so much for a steal but to try to get a shorter clock on the Applause Cardinal gayer floats it across the floor osah sers 6 minutes to play in Stanford has his Z defense back in play here aara out to gayer deep three can you say Benny giler from threee his fourth triple of the game Big Shot Benny 64 is on the board Matt cross lobs it inside it bounces off for trayor but he stays with it a great second effort and more Second Chance points for SMU yeah thats just a big time play you thought Stanford had him stopped but ter never gave up on that play you see snu now trying to go back to their Zone theyre going to sticking the two three they had some success there here comes akara out to sellers one more gor Applause its baby in the trees Stanford by one inside of 5 minutes got to love it Chris he came to play today five triples for the former walk he has reignited Maples Pavilion mag cross into his bag of tricks off the side of the rim Benny might just pull one from here well he he may have a heat check but hes hes capable Applause Chris Reno faces up attacks trayor Applause eight ties nine lead changes between the mangs and Cardinal as we stroll inside of four minutes good crowd on hand for senior day Harris across the floor cross extra pass o quendo late in the Applause clock its Harris step back book it oh hes so good from there he he just knocks down shots hes so steady Chuck Harris from the midrange shot not much you can do he gets over over the top of you and shoots it with a lot of calmness Poise SMU back in front Gaylor Music Glides its Bennys World were all just paying rent Benny in the Jets that was quick that was a big time move causing SMU to burn a timeout to talk about it Benny healer has taken over down the stetch and Stanford has a onepoint lead with 309 to play fun finish in store from the Music farm are going after it well you know what we can finally say this is March this is March Madness and Ive been in the NCAA tournaments Chris and this has that flavor trust me these teams can smell it they want to get in the tournament whether by at large or entry but theyre playing at that level right now eight ties 11 lead changes and perhaps more to come here down the stretch from Maples Pavilion Harris around the eatu screen to the Baseline and it comes up short cross had it for a moment but it Ricochet too well Stanfords done a good job of cutting down their turnovers and if they continue to do that theyll put themselves in position win this game but theyve really struggled against the SMU defense but lately theyve done a really good job not turning it over Benny gayer has galvanized Stanford down the stretch Reno still leads everybody with 24 points backing in the 72 Center across the floor sellers catches Baseline in the air its g a nice job by oiah sell spotting up and Maxim Reno finds his teammate hes done that all year great passer out of the double Stanford by Applause three duck Harris at the peak of the threepoint line Edwards knives in Falling Away it bounces off sers claims it BJ Ed had a really good look to the basket just left it a little bit short some extracurriculars between yigu and rain after the Miss shot and the officials will stop play to look at it yeah they want to look at this and you know I I really commend the officials they could let some of this go Chris but you dont want to let it go because a players can get injured and B this gives an advantage to one team so you want to nip this in the bud so theyll go immediately to the Monitor and and and do the officials coming over to talk to us right now about it as we suspect theyre looking at the contact away from the basketball between the two big men C yigu for SMU Maxim Reno for Stanford I like the football uh image you just did there Chris you put the microphone right up to the officials and you let the let our viewers look at it look it very quick yeah they ni in the butt but nothing extra curricular no but I like that officials do that I like that they come over and inform us or either go on the you know the PA and do it because I think people need to know and you have to give them Kudos when they take care of it that quickly yeah no they did it and they ni the button here you can see it here they knew they know Cooper Flags coming up next yeah well there was the play I dont think there was anything there and again its not always intentional you hit somebody in the head area Chris it doesnt matter if its intentional or not you call it but they said look theres nothing there there was no contact to the head or the face so we play on now if youre Stanford youre in a position to pull ahead here you fought so hard to come back after you were ahead early by double digits now theyre in a position to ahead themselves Stanford 15 and two on their home floor this is the regular season home finale for the Cardinal agarwall barreling in and a tough shot taken by yigo inside he was trying to draw the foul didnt get it and ended up putting up a rush shot SMU secures a key stop u l the handle oh a critical turnover late well nextx te was talking to his teammates saying great help you were there with me you didnt lead me on an island I love it now if again your stand heres a replay look at the help you got agell there just making him think about it turning them back to the to the middle thats great help defensively now your Stanford you must continue to take care of the basketball youre going to get pressed 65 seconds to play on the farm no hurry if youre Stanford Corner pop agar wall off the front rim cross has Applause it theres Chuck haris three for the tie off the heel Edwards the second effort floater bounces off a pair of Misses 8 seconds separate the shot clock in the game clock Applause would you foul here if you were SMU yeah its really tough to run it down when youre down three theyre probably going to have to play a game and get a little more time possession but now its down to 10 probably going to let it go now its kind of late to put the foul a foul had to be earlier Gaylor with three to shoot Ager wall dagger he did it Maxim you are Music magnificent a senior day slam every night should be senior night according to Maxim REO can you believe it Music Applause back on the farm 87 on the second half clock the Cardinal have come on back here in the final minutes six straight for Stanford and the parents of the senior Maxim Reno playing his final game in this building uh they can barely handle these final moments yeah theyre so emotional weve spent time Ive got to know the the Ros pretty well and and theyre just so proud but theyre theyre rooting for the team theyre rooting for their University but theyre happy for their son make no mistake about it I mean thats emotional but but how about the play that that put this crowd and maybe this game out of the you over the top uh the the dunk by raino I mean just you couldnt ask for a better script for him to come back on senior day and just put an exclamation mark on this game not much you can do now if your SMU he is tonights player of the game brought to you by Applebees well even with a quick score here and its got to be quick its going to be tough for SMU to get back in this one you dont want to foul though stop the clock if youre Stanford Edwards taking too much time its going to run out on SMU Stanford un senior day 7368 over SMU Maxim Reno Le
