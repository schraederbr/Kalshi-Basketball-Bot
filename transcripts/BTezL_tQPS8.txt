has been dealing with a lingering left ankle injury If you saw the Eastern Michigan game just a couple weeks ago he missed that one Came back for a few games but is now taking the night off as the Panthers take on Quinnipic and trying to heal up that ankle so he can get healthy for some big games coming up for the Panthers as were underway at the pee Monroe starts things off with a triple for the Bobcats And that is the reigning MAC player of the year and the preseason conference player of the year for the Bobcats Nice start for Monroe who did not play in their last game knocking down that corner three So without Cummings the Panthers insert Barry Dunning Jr into the starting five Dunning has been playing his best basketball of the year as of late and so Jeff Cable gives him the opportunity without Cummings and Barry Dunning Jr the transfer from South Alabama was first team all Sunb Belt a season ago and you see what hes done the past couple games Noah averaging 18 and a half points per game and hes been very hot from distance It tells me one thing one thing only Hes got firepower to him and he struggled early on but thats a new environment Its his fourth school in four years I would imagine the more he gets accustomed to Jeff Cable in this system youre going to keep seeing him produce Dunning nine for 17 from three in the last two games Was also six for six from the line Thursday against Central Florida Jeff Cable is in year eight as the Pit Panthers head coach Talked to him today at shootaround Of course Panthers off to a 42 start would like to have gotten either the West Virginia win or the Central Florida win but he said hes thought a lot about some advice from his father the late Felton Jeffrey Cable II When coach first got into coaching his father said Hey you cant get too high or too low Theres going to be a lot of challenging moments throughout your career You want to stay levelheaded no matter where the season takes you And hes tried to keep that in mind in the first month of the season here in year eight with Pit You see Alipa does a good job sealing there trying to get over that right shoulder and drawing contact and Randall Grant Randall Quinnipak kind of want to try to wall up there just play solid oneonone post defense Roman CPA the freshman for the Panthers battling with Randle down on the low block See Aleppa goes 0 for two from the line And heres the starters for the Bobcats As Sim Jones the point guard mentioned Monroe is the preseason player of the year in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference but Jaden Zimmerman actually the leading scorer for Quinnipic to start the year Hes averaging 152 points per game Music Applause 15 on the timer for the Panthers See Olympa has it in the corner He drives and finds a lane in the paint and gets the two Thats what hes going to do Big fell is a strong downhill driver Gets to his right hand again Able to connect on that one without the foul Jones a deep three pulls up off back iron ways there for the rebound and fouled on the putback attempt and know if they can get Roman CPA more involved offensively thats going to be a good development for them Yeah and the way you attack that close out and get yourself going I know he missed the first two free throws Who doesnt love getting free throws to start the game and probably a stinger when you miss both of them He makes up for it with that strong drive to the basket But hes an important piece you know depending on how many guys theyre going to run out there Hes going to really have to produce offense defense particularly on the rebounding side of the ball Jeff Cable did not expect to have to have Roman C Apa play such a big role early in the season here Of course he had transferred Deshawn Jackson coming in from Iowa State expected to be a big player in the front court alongside that guy right there Cameron Corin who reaching towards his eye He might have gotten poked trainer Daniel Anthony New contact for Cameron Corin Oh man theres nothing worse than a dirty finger touching a contact trying to put those things back in man Middle of the game its just not fun No And the burn you feel afterwards especially 2 minutes in Yeah Corin all good to go And here we get a look may maybe where it occurred there Corin back out there now All set and good to go His Panthers down two early feet inside Caleppa converts See thats that aggressive seal He rolls hard to the rim Gets position and its just an easy layup off the catch Jones loses it Dunning Jr in transition Feed to CPA tried to love it back But the preseason MAC player of the year comes soaring through for the denial Thought we were going to have a little showtime early on Well Noah we talk about Monroe Its not just what he does offensively but one of the best defenders youll see in the league as well Yeah the 38 Steelers per game are noteworthy Thats for sure Amari Monroe the 67 senior from Newberg New York This is his third year at Quinnipiac and off to a good start He did not play in their last game Wednesday Load management Five games in They played division 3 City College of New York and they won by 60 So I think they were good to go without him Fair spare But yes youre right Load management breaches into the college game How about that With only 30 games youd think they just want to play every game Witherspoon in transition He lost the handle but it stays on this end Good hands from Cipa That steal and that hit ahead The hit aheads are so important in transition to just advance the ball before the defense can can get set Now you can play in transition more than in the half court Baseline inbound to Corin Defender leaves him Loses a handle into Weiwayi Gets the roll Scared me for a second Almost lost his dribble there but was able to gather Score for two Dont see him post up a ton Well be looking for that a little bit against Weiway here Panthers looking towards the big bodies on the inside so far See Alpa and Corin combining for their six points to this point Zimmermans drive He didnt have the angle and Corin grabs the rebound Rolling to the rim there Miners defended by Zimmerman Going to get a ball screen from Corin Surveying lobbing Corin backs down way and cant get the roll Tries to tip it back in Now Dunning Jr hes fouled on the threepoint attempt Music So a 64 early lead Wants to get that NCAA tournament birth Yeah I mean winning the regular season title is great but like when you lose before you even get to the conference championship game its its never a good feeling and then it happens to you two years in a row and then all of a sudden the pressure starts to mount a little bit more than the previous two years of like hey can we get this thing done and Im sure that he really wants to get it done come March His 17th season as a division one head coach He was at Hofra from 2001 to 2010 Got another opportunity Went over to Forom and was there for five seasons Its the suits Its cuz they uh I got to credit any coach thats still rocking the suits They just have to Theres too much respect for them to Its because you know its easy You want to just wear the quarter zip He opts for the suit and like Rick Patino Theres a couple staffs that are still doing it that I I appreciate Usually if Rick Patino is doing something you probably should follow I would follow that trend Yeah John Caliperry still rocking the suit I like to see it Moving screen there Look at these suits Is this what youre talking about Look at that Jay Wright suit Unreal That guy on the left he went on to have a decent career I dont think I really remember Jay Wright with black hair like that either Too young But yeah youre telling me they dont look great in those suits Come on I wonder if coach Pakora got his inspir I mean Jay Wright is known as one of the best dressed in college basketball And you know what He keeps it casual too cuz he doesnt do the tie which is fine Like you dont have to have a tie Thats a good bucket there inside by Jaden Zimmerman But I think we misconrue like you got to dress to the nines No you dont But I you know I think its better than you know right I dont want to say it but like youre going to pick your kids up from soccer practice Those two have a great relationship Pakora and Wright In fact when Tom Pakora was done at Forom Jay Wright had worked with Baker Dunlevy who got the head coaching job at Quinnipiac and Jay Wright called him and said You need Tom Pakora on your staff Thats when he joined back in 2017 was the associate head coach for a while And Baker Dunley actually left to go back to Villanova and joined the staff there and thats when Tom Pakora was named the head coach And I think everybody over at Quinnipics campus in Connecticut is happy about that decision No doubt about it Hes doing a phenomenal job 96 game early just about 5 minutes in here at the feet as Sim Jones drives and a goalend there Easy call on Cam Corins defensive attack I like what a Sim Jones can do on the ball like hes just got this burstiness to him off the bounce and yeah clear goalending there but he can get by you with that first step and and the way he can bounce off the ball change his angles like hes a really solid lead guard Sim Jones a senior first season at Quinnipic for him He came in from Florida International Theyre going to get Jaden uh Jaden Zimmerman on that foul there He just got he was burying him down low See Alia Thats a great job fighting for positioning and if youre Zimmerman you got to figure out a way to get around that to either three quarter deny or or front it No What do you make of Pit Clearly looking to get involvement inside on the paint with their bigs through the first six minutes here I love it If you have a mismatch down there then you got to expose it And thats what theyre trying to do here It looked like they were trying to get Kante in in a ball screen but you keep bringing Corin up there Hes got a mismatch right now but hes out on the perimeter So Corin takes a three Shot clock expiring and he drills it And it dont matter that he was on the perimeter Knock it down big fella Cameron Corin came in today just two for eight from threepoint land on the season and he knocks down his first long range attempt on the night 128 Panthers Monroe from downtown Wont go Offensive board Second chance for Quinnipiac And its Samson Riley who connects from the corner What a shot Shot that with a lot of confidence in that corner Corner pocket Noah He made nine of those in their game Wednesday Nine threes 29 points for Samson Riley in the win over City College of New York How much am I to take away from that game when you win by 60 Pit in their four wins has held those four opponents to under 66 points So it just goes to show the mismatch and versatility UCF was able to throw at him was a pretty big problem Panthers going with a big lineup here They got Corin and Conte both 610 on the floor And a turnover on the pass inside by Corin taken away Heres Keith Mcnite Goes oneonone into Coring and a kick out to Riley And the drive there draws a foul like Maker and Gumba for Quinnipic Good defense there Thats the positioning Im talking about When you know youre going to get sealed by the big you do a good job getting in front early for that denial and you come up with a steal and then a foul on the other end You get two free throws And know it looks like Quinnipic is making their own adjustments on the inside knowing that Pit is looking to go to the paint offensively so much Yeah I mean an early counter never hurts And I still think these two teams I know were about seven minutes in Theyre really still filling each other out on where they want to attack So the Bobcats take the lead here at 1312 And a little light fullcourt pressure Applause Music Demarco Miner the Oregon State transfer setting up his offense Throws it away Monroe the other direction Lays it up and is fouled Couldnt convert Well he got one of his steals Hes averaging 38 on the year Great job anticipation anticipating the passing lanes there Picks this off I thought he was going to maybe try to rise up and dunk it and then he got kind of build out with the foul Theres a minimal contact Id say And a rare mistake from DeMarco Miner Usually a reliable guy Veteran presence for this pit team His fifth year at college hoops Yeah Oh look at you I knew I wasnt crazy He gets out of the way there or minor does I think it looked like less than minimal contact Nonetheless they do give the foul call in Monroes favor and he goes two for two from the line 70 run for Quinnipiac Sorry they just they show this soft 221 press that theyll get back into manto man Theyll try to trap Uhoh Indra Situs lobbed it up to Corin who couldnt finish Just got to crank that one Uptempo basketball from the Bobcats but Zimmerman cant hit on the short two Music See Pit likes to really slow their offense down Riley was late picking up Miner and he he kind of allowed him to pick him up so they can get into this this action here as they look for Corin down low Eight to shoot for pit Witherspoon working on Monroe Indraitis crosscourt minor hoist a three wont go Corin tips it out Witherspoon collects goes up strong and has it denied by Mcnite Music Bobcats take this 70 run into the timeout They lead by three Noah the Bobcats on a 70 run Panthers have been cold from the field Whats working for Quinnipic Theyre playing fast and theyre playing decisive They kind of know where they want to get to Theyve gotten to the free throw line a couple times Theyve made a couple good defensive plays that have resulted in transition buckets So just a good little burst for them Pittsburgh with five turnovers in the first eight minutes of this game Nearly had another one there The referee does say it will be Panther ball Lee Cassell Jamal Spearman and Anthony Eids the crew tonight by the way And just look at the athleticism there Grant Randall to get the tip And then the hustle to dive on the floor and Ty Turnage almost safely What do you like about Turn I just like hes just one of those small guards that can just light it up Like he he can give you 10 points in in a twominute burst I remember watching him play when he was a sophomore I was scouting um at Iona Prep and he stood out right away and its really cool to see him get an opportunity here as a freshman on this Quinnipic squad Ty Turnage comes from a great basketball family Has had excellent coaches throughout his career Look at that spin move Applause Panthers once again come up empty on the offensive side Scoring drought for Pit now approaching three minutes Jeff Cable looking for some answers for his offense And Turnage will set up his offense for Quinnipiac A lot of eye popping numbers from that win they had on Wednesday Turnage had 11 assists in the game but now the Panthers force a turnover Numbers in transition but only for the moment And they bring it back out Looked like it might have gone off the foot of Dunning Jr and it did And the Bobcat bench getting into it Tom Pakora loving what hes seeing from his team so far Thats just one of those plays where look how close he is Hes trying to throw the pass to Dunning And thats when you just swing it back to the top of the key and reset your offense Heres Zimmerman the leading scoreer putting his body into Minor Now Turn slicing through the D Great feed to Weiwayi for the slam Its just great read out of the pick and roll wide open I believe Turnig is averaging four assists per game So he comes off the bench and produces in a number of different ways Heres Dunning Eight on the timer looking for Corin 15footer Swirls out See offensive board Second chance is in Strong Good offensive rebound Good position Good touch See Olympa had two points Thursday down in Florida Hes already got six tonight and hes a perfect three of three from the floor But Mcnite answers for the Bobcats The oldfashioned rip one dribble pull in the midrange I like it Glad the midrange jumpers did Im trying to keep it alive for my broadcasting scene I would love for the midrange to stay alive so we can get an offensive foul Offensive foul called against the Panthers And this is just great point guard play here And you got no nobody on the low man Demarco Miner got to pull over and tag there and pick up Weiwayi rolling to the cup He leaves him wide open Stuffs it Great job by Turn to thread the needle Weiwayi finishes it off Very balanced attack from Quinnipiac So far they got 19 points from seven different players And Jaden Zimmerman off the mark on that deep attempt Had Zimmerman open on that flare screen Just wasnt able to knock it down Anditis gets to the elbow Cant connect Turnage is there waiting for it And the Bobcats will set up their half court set Screen from Weiwayi Turnage Monroe oneonone on Miner in the short corner Backing down the guard uses the mismatch and hits the turnaround Jay Wow He wanted to drive it at first and then he turned it into a post up and goes to that baseline fade away Its a pretty shot there for Monroe The lead is seven for Quinnipic the team picked to win the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference And another pit turnover this time from Demarco Miner Yeah theres that post up He sees the chuck coming from Indraitis and just spins it back to the baseline Its such a hard shot to defend too Theres a reason hes the preseason conference player of the year 181 points a game last season for Amari Monroe Hes got seven today to lead all scorers Pull up three for him connects in a timeout taken by Jeff Credit that coach Pakura deserves is you give a a kid an opportunity like this and he maximizes it which is what Monroes done Had some offers from some big time programs in the off season Monroe could have left this Quinnipic team and moved on And Tom Pakora largely just saying its an instance where a guy really values the family hes built here the opportunity he has for himself knowing hes going to be the star player Of course you go to a power conference program youre not guaranteed a certain amount of minutes And he knew if he came back to Quinnipic he had an opportunity to go down as maybe the best the program has ever seen So he returns for his third season in a Bobcat uniform and hes got an opportunity today to lead them to what would be a huge win Yeah And theres something to be said about a player that takes advantage of 30 plus minutes per game as the best player on their team no matter what the conference is versus like you mentioned if you wanted to transfer up after being MAC player of the year You could find yourself in a position where youre playing less than 15 minutes a game and all of a sudden your opportunity shrinks Its gone in a season and the decision hes made to just stay where hes at and produce is to me the right one And hes got a great sidekick and Jaden Zimmerman who we mentioned is actually the leading scorer this season for the Bobcats Panthers answer right away And weve got a ninepoint game I like the play there You get the ball up ahead to Corin One power dribble and up strong No messing around with it as he comes up with the steal and little bit of everything out there And if the jumpers clicking then hes really really dangerous Yeah No you and I were chatting before the game saying Well the one thing he doesnt do great is shoot from the distance Hes only 18 from three on the year Well hes even doing that Two for three tonight right And and if its working for him beyond the threepoint line and hes a threelevel scorer then again hes going to be really hard to keep up with particularly when MAC play starts later in December Bobcats have made their last four from the field Theyve got a doubledigit lead here midway through the first half at pit Corin all the way crosscourt Indraitis triple is good That helps Good pass out of the post from Corin there Catch and shoot from Indraitis and does his job knocking it down Panthers trying to get the Iowa State transfer going here First season at Pit Applause Turnage gets to his spot just inside the arc and hits the deep two Just such a tough contested midrange jumper off the bounce from freshman point guard Make that five in a row for Quinnipiac from the floor now in transition Monroe up to Randall who slams it down It just felt like one too many passes from Pit on the offensive end that ended up in a turnover Actually like Cam K if he just shot the threepointer He had about 3 or 4 feet of space Anditis penetrates off the screen from Corin and draws contact from Nate Gurin Gamba Quinnipiac very smart and efficient in choosing when to work in transition Thats what they did here And look at Amari Monroe Hes the man that was there anticipating the back and forth being in helpside on that and then kicks it ahead to Randall who takes off for the slam First points of the game for Randall and Pit just not taking care of the basketball Nine turnovers tonight for the Panthers and Quinnipic taking advantage Yeah and Pit Pit is susceptible to turning the ball over And it was going to be interesting to see if the Bobcats could sort of exploit that by you know a lot of ball pressure getting in those passing lanes And theyve done that early on forcing nine turnovers before the 15 before were 15 minutes into the game Panthers pressure pays off See Aleppa gets the takeaway and draws contact and the foul goes against Monroe And that is going to be his second So a story line to watch here Quinnipic with that 10point lead but Monroe picks up foul number two And if Tom Pakora is going to have to monitor his status certainly could make an impact on this game when preseason conference player of the year is in foul trouble Hes got to get through six more minutes without another foul if coach is going to keep him in there And hes not Maybe thought about it for a moment there Well maybe you cut it in half Maybe you sit him for three and then bring them in in the last three to play it a little safer You have to think the fact that theyre up 10 plays into that decision though 100 If youre down 10 it it becomes a little trickier of like okay we dont want to put it at risk of going down now or never if youre down 10 right Right See continues to struggle from the line Offensive rebound for Pit Good job tipping it out Uhoh Dunning Whoa Barry Dunning Jr We knew he could shoot I dont know if we knew he had that in him My oh my Blows by nobody and then hangs in the air and that was kind of like one of those Blake Griffin flushes He took off from way out there and was able to just graze the rim on that poster slam What a dunk Jeff Cable has talked about this guy playing with force Thats the word hes used to describe Barry Dunning Jr over the last few games cuz hes got a different confidence in him That was incredible And its plays like that that can switch the momentum in a game Dunning Jr six points four for four from the line And how about that big time slam and suddenly theres some energy in this building and on this pit team Caleppa takes it himself and hell go to the line Now Caleeppa has had seams down the lane every single time hes caught the ball The the thing that you want to be careful of is once they scout you at a timeout at halftime and they know hey Caleppa number 13 hes going to go hard righthand drive every time You saw it on that drive The play there was to stop on two Now you throw a shot fake and its a step through or a pass right You know you can beat him off the drive every single time and you got Corin ceiling and you know Weiwayi is going to come over and pull So if you jump stop play off two feet Its the first thing they teach you when you get in college basketball Were playing off two here He didnt do anything wrong It just is an additive to help him create a secondary play there Only problem for CPAP is hes now two for seven from the line However the Panthers have cut into what was once a 12point lead for Quinnipiac and theyve cut that lead to just six C Aleppo with the eight points but again leaving a few on the table at the charity strike Mentioned the energy in the building since the Barry Dunning Jr dunk Pit team with a different life to him here in the final five minutes of the first half Corin fakes the pass and connects on a three He made me nervous there for a second He hesitated and ultimately was too wide open to not shoot it and does a good job just refocusing and knocking that thing down with confidence Pits back in it The Panthers need their big man Cameron Corin Hes got 10 points and hes two for two from downtown Just an easy fill up Quick ball fake You dont want to close out on me Thats fine Im going to take my time and knock it down And faked the pass Sold it just well enough that he got Samson Riley looking over at the wing defensively for Quinnipic Took the opportunity and hit the three Now we talked about Quinnipic They had a run midway through the first half Got up by 12 Well now its the Panthers who are on a 90 run of their own Theyve hit their last four from the field and its starting started with Barry Dunning Jrs dunk The other checkpoint was Amari Monroe coming out of the game and then boom a a 90 run for this Pit Panther squad They just theyve upped their intensity particularly on the defensive end coming up with these steals and then the decisive plays on offense And theyre playing with a little more pace They generally want to play a little slower in the half court but when youre in transition its the best way to play Really quick the accumulation of the points there for the Panthers as well The 90 run coming in just a minute and 7 seconds And you hit on it could kind of point to when Amari Monroe came out of the game Thats when things started offensively working for the Panthers Out of bounds in the corner it was Keith Mcnite off the pass from Turnage And once again the Bobcats give the ball back to the Panthers Music You can see that left foot of Keith Mcnite Bobcats with three turnovers in the last two minutes They had been taking such great care of the basketball But a big reason why the Panthers have climbed back into this one Donning too strong on the three See Alpa the board Kick out Indraitis Three in the air Off back iron and coralled by Randall Applause Turnage Step back three from the wing He buries it What a shot Ty Turnage with five points two assists off the bench Big time minutes for the Bobcats That was not easy Thats his second heavily contested jump shot in this first half that hes gotten to drop He just plays without any fear But a great drive from another guy who goes confidently into the paint Roman Caleppa with a big time play Hes in double figures and sprints all the way back to try and make the play on defense His continuation steps finishes on the left side So like he understands where he wants to get to on the floor Its the rim Whats the best way to do that Drive with my right hand And hes got a 10 points He had a great rugby career in Australia Jeff Cable said he saw Roman Cupa in the facility last week He was watching something or playing a game on his phone He said What you doing playing a game And Roma said No Im watching rugby Wow I would not want to go near him in a rugby match No You can tell hes played though Yeah you can Right Cable said this is the first time really in his life where Caleppa has just focused on basketball Hes used to being a multisport guy and now hes dedicated his time solely to the hardwood and having a good start to his game tonight Good pass Dunning Jr too strong on the three put back Look at him eating It feels like he has more than four rebounds doesnt it Yeah I was just reading that here on the stats I cant believe its only four Feels like hes been everywhere See doing a lot for the Panthers tonight Theyre down four under three minutes to go first half but they do have the momentum right now Riley connects on a three Difficult shot Takes a lot of confidence to shoot that type of shot Music Every time the Panthers have chipped into that lead Quinnipic has had a response They did lead by as many as 12 now down to seven Calempa once again aggressive to the rim Kicks out this time to Miner Too strong on the three Dunning Jr the offensive board and stripped away by Mcnite Thats Pits 12th offensive rebound Their ability to create second chance opportunities could be really big down the stretch is could come back to hurt Quinnipiac Panthers have 10 second chance points but Randall fires and hits on the three Quinnipic is 6 for9 from beyond the ark Randles got seven points now Hes Hes having a strong outing as well Just playing with a lot of confidence out there Miner takes it himself and is fouled on the way out Great defensive play there by Mcnite Noah Yep And then he he does a good job not traveling and then that throwback there Shot fake gathers his footing and then drills a three Thats actually 10 Did I have that wrong 10 point He has 10 points Grant Randle No Randle has seven Sorry Im reading the wrong thing Apologies He is one of four Quinnipic players with a made three here in the first half And thats such a big shot too because Riley hits a three the possession prior and then Randall hits it to follow it up and and all of a sudden prior to that free throw from Miner was you know back to being a 10point game And youre under two here going into the half Another offensive board for Caleppa Kick out to Witherspoon Panthers get a fresh set Indra Situs Ball reversal to Miner Cant get the three Theyre getting clean looks They just havent been able to get him to drop But these are clean looks the Panthers are getting from the threepoint line Pit now just three of 11 from beyond the arc on the night Thats one of the main differences in this game Quinnipiac is six for nine from the perimeter Riley working on Witherspoon with 10 on the timer Crosses over kicks baseline drive Mcnite throws it down Wow another one some highlight dunks and he blew by Seal up on that baseline and then cocked it back And what a run for Quinnipiac without Amari Monroe on the floor The preseason conference player of the year has been on the bench as Quinnipic gets the lead back up to 11 Kick out to Miner Drills a three He can take a breath now Finally got one to go down and it was another clean look did a good job staying confident shooting that thing They were trying to find Caleppa down there He gave up trying to get the positioning and then they gave it to him and he did a great job throwing it out to Miner for three Quinnipic can hold for the last shot of the half Ty Turnage controlling Hes had an excellent first 20 minutes for the Bobcats Working on Dunning the Switch from Indraitis Turnage out of control but he somehow gets it to Randall off the window And thats how the first 20 minutes will end Group of hot hands on the Quinnipi Armari Witherspoon Scoreless so far for the Panthers Trying to get some penetration here Muscles his way in Tried to feed it off to Corin but nothing doing It goes back to the Bobcats Applause Monroe back door cut Zimmerman nearly had the reverse but couldnt get the finish Great pass Great cut Coach Cable wants them to get into their action sooner Corin with the hand off to Witherspoon Roll from Corin backing down way turns to the right hand and draws contact Third personal on Spence Weiwayi sophomore forward for Quinnipiac And thats going to be a story to watch as the second half develops No we talked about a little foul trouble for the Bobcats Weiiwayi is the tallest player theyve got on the roster He picked up his third And in addition to that youve got Zimmerman the leading scorer with two and Amari Monroe the preseason conference player of the year with two So three very important pieces there with at least two fouls for Quinnipak Yeah you got to be careful but thats the price you pay when you bring physicality on the defensive end You just got to figure out a way to stay solid and not foul away Not those guys in particular Just be a little extra smart on the defensive end of the floor Sim Jones drives and the put back for Weiwayi cuz if hes out of the game then he cant do things like that Offensive rebound put back slam You take them any day Tom Fakura keeps him on the floor with the three fouls and it pays off on the jam 11point lead for the Bobcats Miner feed to Dunning working on Monroe Kick out to Indraitis Dunning Jr squares up and hits a three Whats crazy is thats a really solid defensive possession from the Bobcats I mean they theyre up in these Pit Panthers grill on every catch Really good playing the closeouts but just a a better shot from Barry Dunning Jr And theyre back in that one 122 press Noah that caused some problems for Quinnipic in the first half Yeah you want to try to slow him down a little bit and not let them control the pace of this game Jones kick out open Zimmerman No Randall the offensive board tipped around Monroe cant get it still stays with Quinnipiac and Weiiwayi finishes Too much ball watching Not enough body onbody pushing someone out to go get that defensive rebound and it results in two Panthers have been solid on the glass so far tonight but that time Quinnak getting multiple chances and ultimately executing See Aleppa backing down Zimmerman Kick out Dunning swings to Miner way too strong on the three Missed everything and Randall comes up with it Talked about how efficient Tai Turnage was in the first half for Quinnipiac Theyre back now to the starting point guard a Sim Jones who drives and kicks Zimmerman hoist and too strong on the three Corin grabs it Go to that baseline drift Cant knock down the quarter three Zimmerman struggled a little bit here so far Nice Corin Good bucket there Just strong inside the paint Got to play bully ball with him Hell dominate every chance you give him 610 235 The senior from Allen Texas leads all Panthers with 13 Him and Caleppa have over half the Panthers points Those two have combined for 25 CPA tips it away No one in front of him Look out Hammer time Hes just a Hes ferocious Like the way he plays is every movement is just so aggressive I knew he was going to rock the rim on that There was no way he was just going to give you a soft dunk Not one of those plays you can feel the momentum start to swing back in Pits favor Panther bench is on its feet and some energy back in the Pete Sixpoint game Quinnipic has led by as many as 12 Monroe from deep misfires Caleppa tracks down the board once again Aggressive to the bucket and finishes Music Hes having a night Unbelievable Defense to offense Hes doing it all And hes showing why Pit fans were so excited to see what he could do in his freshman year 16 and seven for Caleppa Here goes Miner Dish off Dunning Too much We would have had a nice roar there if that went down cuz Caleppa again the catalyst of that defensive play with a block on Amari Monroe Hes doing it all every possession He wont let up Quinnipic hasnt scored in the last two and a half Zimmerman into Dunning and a foul called against the South Alabama team in his young career as a Pit Panther Its definitely his coming out party and its awesome to see him do it at home in front of this crowd so they can feel the energy of the type of player they got Hes hes going to give it his all every single possession Hes proven that to you tonight Hes been awesome to watch Jeff Cable talking to his team earlier today about how short the season really is and they do not have time to waste Even for a freshman like Caleppa the development has to come quick and it has come here tonight 16 points for the freshman from Australia when his team has really needed him in a game that they trailed by 12 in the first half Yeah thats the big thing Theyve really really needed what he has provided and its a really awesome place to be for him cuz now you kind of understand where your spots are on the floor and how to go get them as they go to him here Right back to the bucket Strong take See youa Have a night young man Here we go at this point again Another righthanded downhill drive This time he shoots it on the way down and absorbs all that contact He wants all all of the smoke Hes not backing away from anything And the the problem is is that Quinnipic officially has nobody that can stay in front of the big fella Caleppa Barry Dunning Jr the stick back And weve got a tie game A 100 run The Panthers have outscored Quinnipic 144 in the second half Applause Music Monroe looking for an option Kicks out Zimmerman buries a three Its a big time shot for Jaden Zimmerman His first threepointer of the night Hadnt been able to get anything going Yeah what a time for it The Bobcats allowing Pit to tie the score once again They respond See Aleppa Same play same result All the way to the glass and in He cant help himself He literally cant help himself You want to give me the righthanded drive guys Im going to keep taking it Where is the help side pulling over to stunt at these righthanded drives At some point youre going to have to help off the strong side corner and send a second body at Caleppa Mcnite wanted a slam of his own Good defense by Dunning Jr Miner kick out Indra Sites cant get the three Mcnite holds it in Miner with a poke away and all the way up onto the scores table Luckily kept his balance Balance there Yeah Noah they cant stop this guy What else do you WANT ME TO SAY ABOUT HIM HOW many times can I analyze a righthanded drive downhill He cant stop scoring And I think that was more of a rim stuff than a block but Barry Dunning Jr did a really nice job getting up there and contesting that Otherwise it probably would have been flushed Roman CPA taking a welldeserved break and an ovation from the crowd here in the Pete What a move What a drive from Jones Everything but the finish Anditis looking to get the Panthers the lead back Kick out Witherspoon wont go Donning Juniors there for the board and a foul on the rebound called against Pit Applause Third foul called against Barry Dunning Jr and he was really the only one in the vicinity on the rebound And theres a reason for that He pushed off on Keith Mcnite Hes going to get a breather but his minutes have been invaluable tonight The athleticism hes displayed on both ends of the floor really important for this Panther squad Randle drives baseline looks crosscourt just about seven and a half minutes into this second half And while the Panthers havent gotten the lead back remember they were down 10 at the break theyve got it back to a onepoint margin And a foul called that will send Amari Monroe to the line And this will give Amari Monroe a chance to feel the ball go back in the hoop again after taking the last six minutes of that first half on the bench He hasnt really seen anything involvement wise here in the first eight seven and a half eight minutes of this second half So you get Jaden Zimmerman to knock down his first three if Monroe can connect on both of these She misses the first You can start to find a little more rhythm as your lead has been cut to one Yeah Monroe he was doing everything in the first half for Quinnipiac He has not scored in the second half and he does just now His first free throw but hes 0 for three from the floor in eight minutes of this second half Bobcats up by two Panthers have certainly been the better team since the break but still trailing by two Quinnipak in a 131 It looks like theyre bringing Mcnite up high Yep seeing if they can slow down a pit offense that has found a rhythm here in the second More swings initis baseline and a foul on a Sim Jones who will pick up his set A big reason why the Panthers have outscored Quinnipiac 168 in the second half See Olympa has half of Pits points since the break But a turnover there from Omari Witherspoon the other Panther freshman That gives it right back to the Bobcats And that is the 11th turnover on the night for Pit And a steal now going the other way Mari Moore but he stepped out of bounds Jeff Cable trying to argue that he was pushed out of bounds but to no avail And it will go right back to the Bobcats And he did a good job jumping that pass but yeah could not toetap that sideline Tiptoe not toe tap Wrong TT Either one works right Either one right Okay I was thinking toe tap was like you try to bring in the catch on the sideline Thats cuz we were talking about AJ Brown before the game Ah but a twopoint game here at the Pete and a drive there from Jaden Zimmerman He draws a foul and he will head to the line As good as the Panthers have been this half they still have not gotten the lead since the 1347 mark in the first half And right when it seems like theyre in position to regain the advantage is when Quinnipic tends to find some offensive rhythm again So Zimmerman heads to the line Bobcats leading scorer on the year And even some struggles from the line for the Bobcats Theyve just gone cold all around here in the second half Applause 0 for two from the stripe for Zimmerman Applause and just everything in early of this second half seems to be going Pits way Can it continue here out of the timeout Indraitis gives off to Caleeppa whos back in after taking a rest More Indraitis five to shoot too strong Jones the rebound Indraitis one for four from beyond the arc tonight Jones the kick out Zimmerman got him biting on the fake but cant hit the midrange Now Miner pushing tempo tried the euroep out Caleppa tries a three that wont go and Zimmerman gets it for Quinnipiac Applause Roman Cppa been very efficient in the paint He has not yet had too much luck with the threepoint shot And on the other end Mari Moore gets called for the foul But hey sometimes when youre feeling it youre feeling it I was just going to say like he doesnt shoot a ton of threes but at that point that trail spot that hes running in you get the ball pitched back to you why not just let it go I dont think it was the worst shot in the world especially for your leading scoreer in the ball game That was his first threepoint attempt of the night So he left a 27 from beyond the arc coming into this game It was only his 12th threepoint attempt on the year So yeah not taking a ton of them Drive from Jones Back door on Monroe Get beat on that back door on the baseline Pretty feed from Asim Jones Both those Quinnipic point guards with some big time plays today Sim Jones in Tai Turnage Kari Moore getting some solid minutes here in the second half Remember Panthers are without Brandon Cummings tonight Dunning Jr Misfires on the three Moore swept it away from Jones and gets the two A good job staying in the play Turns your back Good swipe Good bucket Mari Moore the freshman from Michigan Havent seen too much of him this season but without Cummings tonight Panthers relying on him And he makes a big play there but Jones will get to the line on the other end Yeah Jones gets downhill and Caleppa is just too high up in helpside not seeing ball and man And then theres the Mari Mo strip Give me that Thank you And nice finish too over Monroe And big time play there by Moore Sometimes obviously you dont want to be without Brandon Cummings if youre pit but what it does do is it accelerates the development of a guy like Mari Moore was one of the top recruits out of Michigan in this 2025 class but hasnt seen the floor too much early in his pick career That was actually his first field goal attempt on the night Hes only played six minutes but Panthers going to need him in the late stages of this game playing shorthanded without Cummings No doubt about it The lead is four for Quinnipiac Applause Miner pulls up Quinnipics doing that zone look Crosscourtis ball fake and drive Muscles his way to the bucket Sat on the iron but didnt drop Heres Music Monroe Crossover on C Appa and off the glass Look at that He had a nice head of steam too when he got that pitch to just rip a quick left to right crossover And Caleppa couldnt turn his hips quick enough to keep up And a 131 zone that the Bobcats arena has caused a little bit of a problem for Pittsburgh Indraitis cant get the three And the Sim Jones has done a nice job controlling this Bobcat offense keeping them calm composed with a sixpoint lead here midway through the second half Heres Jones Goes baseline Ball fake Now in trouble in the short corner Finds a teammate and a drive there from Mcnite Draws contact And this is an NBA level crossover here Yeah You know what I actually it was so quick I missed it cuz he did put it in his left and then didnt even take a dribble with his left It was so fast to go right left back to right and he knew it Thats thats saucy Just a really neat story Of course weve talked about it throughout the first half Amari Monroe of course he plays for Quinnipic here in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference Noah but this is a guy who has high major level talent and has to be even more rewarding for him when it shows against high major teams like Pit Yeah theres no doubt about it And I think the the even more special thing that I think about with his story I mean look at the jump Three points a game to 12 to 18 Hes not where he was last year only five games into the season But the special part about his story is the empowerment from Tom Pakora to enable this type of play from him knowing you know he sees him every day He knows whats inside of him and then to fully maximize his potential here at Quinnipic has been remarkable Monroe really has a chance to do something special Quinnipic has never made the NCAA tournament He could be the guy to lead them there this season But Barry Dunning Jr capitalizes on the three for Pit on the second opportunity and the lead is down to four Barrys a player man He Hes got so much to offer on both sides of the ball I know he hasnt had it working the way hed like from the threepoint line but just does a good job staying in it not losing confidence and knocks that one down Dunning was averaging 28 points through the first four games of the year Hes been in double figures in every game since Asim Jones working on Coring Great defense by the Panther Big Its a great job by Corin not letting him manipulate the footwork Miner oneonone with Randall goes baseline hangs Corin soaring in but Jones comes up with it And a foul in the back court will go against the Panthers talked about it early in the first half but the Panthers are without Deshawn Jackson whos out indefinitely due to medical reasons A guy they thought they would have 611 big a transfer from Iowa State Its situations like this where you could really use him and have some depth on the inside but instead with 708 to go you got to leave Cameron Corin in with those four fouls He has been a difference maker tonight but the Panthers trail by six Youre going to get this 221 press from the Bobcats And Tai Turnage back in the game for Quinnipic Yeah How about first appearance of the second half for him 13 minutes it took to bring him back in Yeah he was great in the first half Yeah but he gets in here as Sim Jones takes a break Demarco Miner looking to set up his offense Nine to shoot for bit Corin on the roll He cant find him Miner kicks out Witherspoon Oneonone Step back three Got it What a shot Cool calm and collected No reaction from Witherspoon Just gets right to that left side step back Been a quiet night for him So nice to see one go down First made field goal for Witherspoon Lead is down to three Turnage step back corner Randall connects Wow Yeah you said it Ty Turnage coming in immediately making a difference in the game Yeah And it really didnt even get a ton downhill on that drive It just was youre playing too far up on in helpside And he throws it to that corner and then comes up with a steal here Witherspoons pass was taken away Now the Bobcats set things up Ty Turnage swings to Monroe Thought about the three takes the three makes the three Amari Monroe with 18 points to lead all scorers on this Quinnipic team Thats backtoback possessions You give up threepointers in the same spot of of the floor Uhoh Miners pass tipped away Stuck at the elbow Witherspoon three for Dunning Yes Great answer margin that they typically like to see and Quinnipic very efficient from the floor So Pittsburgh in some areas allowing the Bobcats to be more efficient on offense than most of the teams theyve faced this season and it starts with that guy Amari Monroe is up to 20 points Yeah And the other big thing here is just the discrepancy in threepoint percentage I mean Quinnipic is nine of 15 Theyre shooting 60 from three and pit just 32 And thats the main difference in this ball game Lob was intended for Dunning Jr couldnt quite catch it And heres Turnage who comes in very fresh with a lot of energy Talked about how he sat for the first 12 minutes of this second half Immediately has come in and made an impact Turnage has seven assists most of anyone in this game Monroe baseline Jay with no angle He still connects Thats just a really good player doing really good things that he knows he can execute And when hes feeling it like that especially when you work the midrange kind of got a little Kawhi Leonard released to him And hes lethal in the midrange today And just like that the Quinnipic lead is back to what it was at halftime A 10point margin And Tai Turnage is in no hurry Monroe back to Turnage Swung all the way over to Randall Corner three is good Applause Thats just a simple swing Swing and that left corner Music is killing the Pit Panthers here late in the second half Thats the third triple the last three or four minutes from the same spot Grant Randall averaged 19 points per game last season for Quinnipiac He has 15 tonight and the Panthers are running out of time down 13 with just over three minutes to play Quinnipic doesnt have to do anything out of the ordinary kill clock Take your time as Turnage tries to force the issue there Its going to might result in points but a big time defensive play from Zimmerman He does get called for the foul but good hustle to get back Its a minutes when Pit went on the 90 run after Monroe got subbed out It ended up not really mattering with this these multiple runs that the Bobcats have gone on since to now ultimately still be up double dig double digits Still work to do for the Bobcats 11point game three minutes Still plenty of time here The Panthers are in the fullourt press as expected out of the timeout Ty Turn the feed to Mcnite and now they settle down in the half court Turnage will set things up Both of them wanted to shoot it and they both made the right decision to just set up the offense and use more of the shot clock Now a really interesting what weve seen from Tom Pakoras management of his point guards We talked about it a little bit earlier but he uses a Sim Jones basically for the first 10 minutes of the second half and now we havent seen him since Tai Turnage entered the game Yeah And I I would expect Ty Turnage to finish the game here and a Sim Jones on the bench And its interesting because in my mind theres probably a scenario where you could play the both of them I know that would make your back court a little smaller and you probably you know question Ty Turnigs ability to guard a two guard versus just guarding you know someone of similar height like DeMarco uh Miner But it is fascinating how he has split their minutes and hes gotten I wouldnt say equal production but almost better production from his his his backup point guard Ty Turnig than his starting point guard of Sim Jones Tai Turnage with seven assists Hes only taken two shots from the floor but hes made both of them And a very efficient 16 minutes for the Bobcat freshman Indraitus had it poked away Gets it back Goes up strong and gets it off the window 10point game Panthers stay in the full court Indraitis is on turnage and this is slow down methodical use the whole clock get the best available shot under the third 10 seconds of this shot clock which would be right now and thats when turnage will begin their action kicks out to Monroe step back three Omari Monroe is on a different level and he cant help but crack a smile as he trots back down the floor with his 25 points He only missed four shots Nine of 13 Hes four of six from three Good answer there from Indraitis But Amari Monroe is just the epitome of feeling it Like when your jumper is working like that you just go back to it And that wasnt easy Thats Thats good defense Thats great defense because you drive baseline and Dunning is there on the drive Stops you there You got tight corners quarters in that corner for the step back We got a little football pass here Its a phenomenal shot from Amari Monroe And Panthers electing not to foul really Just some tight pressure defensively and pays off It pays off Youre right They get the turnover Officials say it last win off Quinnipiaak Good job by DeMarco Miner here Just enough pressure to get the tip Looked like he caught the elbow turnage there And so it did it did go off the hand of turnage but Miner maybe getting away with one Incitus drives hesitates in the lane gets it off the glass cuts the lead down to eight Good split good score on that little dribble tap there as Pit is in desperation mode to get another steal Miner pokes it away but its last off DeMarco Miner Eightpoint game 59 ticks to go Corin after the break See Uppa Indraitis Panthers need to move quickly Drive from Inditis He falls and is called for the travel Thats a tough break for the Panthers coming out of that timeout Not able to execute anything Down eight Panthers stay in that full court 48 seconds to go However they are still not fouling Just some heavy pressure on Quinnipic And now Jeff Cable orders his team to foul with 39 seconds to go And its Indraitis who commits it And you got to say Noah when you look at this night from Amari Monroe in the era of the transfer portal and NIL and a lot more sympathy from everybody towards the mid majors losing players of his caliber for him to come back to Quinnipiac for his third season and have a 25point night on the road in what could be a huge win over an ACC opponent for the Bobcats Its a really neat story and one that Im sure serves as a reward for his loyalty and his commitment to the school Yeah I mean just a special night for a special player Clearly Mack player of the year preseason MAC player of the year again this year on the best team in the conference for now what would be the third year in a row and hes proven hes showed it tonight versus an ACC opponent how good he is Step through See Alpa blocked by Mcnite and a foul committed by the Panthers And the Bobcats can start to feel it now Applause Tom Pakora making sure his team stays focused for the final 29 seconds here at the peak as Brandon Cummings the hometown kid looks on having missed tonights game due to the ankle injury a guy that has been a Pit Basketball fan his whole life Such a key part of the team not just this season but last season as well And his Panthers will look for answers in the coming weeks But no time to waste Theyre going to have Ohio State in this building on Friday 23 seconds to go Even a play like that theyre theyre up 10 And Mc Knight still playing just as hard as he was from minute number one And thats been the story of this game is how hard Quinnipiacs played both sides of the ball Andrew Situs has done a lot of the offensive production late here for Pit He is suddenly up to 14 points Panthers not given up just yet And now they will let the Quinnipak Bobcats dribble it out behind Amari Monroes 25 points What a massive win on the road And for the first time in the history of Quinnipic basketball they have defeated an ACC opponent
