We welcome those of you just joining us to Maples Pavilion for the ACC opener for both Notre Dame and Stanford with Sean Farnum and our ESPN crew Roxy Bernstein with you just getting going right before New Years in the Bay Area Notre Dame and the Stanford Cardinal And its deflected out 13 to shoot for the Irish who are nine and four Stanford 112 The Cardinal have won four straight heading into this matchup with the Fighting Irish And well be talking about the ACC all night long and and how much better this nonconference stretch was leading into conference play for the ACC But a big part of that are teams like Stanford teams like Cal and Miami who are so much more improved than where they were a year ago Underneath and the layin spins out the tip and it goes Carson Tout for Notre Dame with the games first points A concern for Stanford was how do they match the physicality of Tout I mean he is a strong physical presence that wants to wrestle with you He does a great job wedging in getting offensive rebounds and getting those put backs Here is Ibuka Okori third in the country in scoring a freshman guard for the Cardinal The over the weight as Chisak Par attacks the rack right over the top of t just an unbelievable finish there turning the corner with aggressiveness The transfer from Harvard and were tied at two just over a minute in a talented freshman losing the handle Jaylen Harelson kept alive though by Notre Dame Braden Shrewsberry on the drive Eric Sundra dumps it off inside the flip Carson Tout with all four for Notre Dame Lack of communication defensively on the interior for Stanford there I mean they just left Tout wide open standing right in front of the rim Tout in his seventh year of college basketball Benny Geler slips back door for the layin to tie it for the Cardinal and the former walkon Heres Carson Tap the leaner left it short and the rebound tipped free and Ibuka Okori has it Here come the Cardinal and stepping on the sideline Chisam Par but he already has a highlight reel play Yeah even so far But watch the aggressiveness here He he looks like hes going to go into a dribble handoff but he turns the corner able to finish up over the top and south Theres one thing that Notre Dame struggles with They dont have a shot blocker underneath You know theres no Jordan Cornet underneath the basket The alltime leading shot blocker in Notre Dame history Its a first of what I promise to be at least two mentions of Jordan tonight Jaylen Harelson traveled and Notre Dame gives it right back to Stanford as the Fighting Irish played a challenging schedule and coming off that frustrating loss though right before Christmas to Purdue Fort Wayne at home Yeah And there were we talked a little bit about the details were starting to slip a little bit When you start to have success how do you handle success And this team in particular started leaving defensively a little bit too much of Im stopping my guy but lacking the team awareness of how they had to execute Nice pass inside to AJ Roi and Stanford with their first lead Quickly back the other way and attacking the layup rattles out Carson Town cant get it to go and the rebound pulled down by Stanford A good look initially by Jaylen Harelson One of the keys tonight cheering for Notre Dame is to get back in defensive transition on three They want to get back in defensive transition They want to take away the ability for Ibuka Cororey to to score downhill And then theyve got to theyve got to play defense without fouling because Stanford does a great job of getting to the free throw line cheering Diving for the loose ball Carson T trying to get timeout but hes tied up by AJ Roi and the arrow belongs to Stanford That is true and but hes done a great job here I mean in the whole nerve ball philosophy which has a lot to do with analytics His coaching tree includes Todd Golden who won a national championship obviously last year at Florida Hes done a really good job his first two years of building a roster that can compete Chisam Parara drives across the key throws it up and well get to the line and a couple of free throws for Apara and Kyle Smith of course part of that Randy Bennett coaching tree across the bay over at St Marys I I love Akara and you mentioned transferring from Harvard Hes got such a strong frame He wants to get to that right hand and we saw him drive into the the center of the paint He usually likes to play off of two feet and you look at his upper body and you can understand how he gets to the free throw line so frequently Had 20 points last time out against Cal State Northridge and is off to a great start here this evening One more shot for Akara Stanford 112 with wins against schools like Colorado Minnesota St Louis The only losses for Stanford were a little bit surprising though The Seattle Us got a really good net ranking out of the West Coast Conference and that was one of their losses right here and the other coming to UNLV A onepoint game Jamak Par with six Stanfords 10 underneath and a slam for Kevin Jai Yeah Akara stepped up and anytime you can get the back line of your defense to have to get in rotations and step up usually youre going to clear out a spot and that dunker spot if you can get there and catch and finish it makes it real easy for you couple times now theyve been able to find that rotation along that backside and get easy looks in the paint for Notre Dame Apar weeds his way inside missed a shot at the rim and a tie up as Oscar Heel Day goes to the deck with Kevin Chai and Notre Dame gets the basketball They have the arrow going their way ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketballs brought to you by K the official partner of Couples who love the game and the new pretzel bacon smasher Live free eat Sonic in San Francisco Big win for Mark Madson in that program Syracuse knocking off Tennessee as part of that challenge And look the ACC showed much much better in in that SEC ACC challenge this year And because of it they go into conference play with the expectation that there could be up eight maybe even 10 teams that get into the NCAA tournament a far cry from where they were a year ago Last touch by Ryan Agarwal of Stanford belongs to Notre Dame on the baseline with 10 on the shot clock We have nine different teams in the ACC that have started 10 and two or better Well and Roxy no conference maybe went through more of the coaching carousel of coaching changes in recent years AC steal Benny Geler lines it up missed a three and flying in for the rebound Kev Jai for the Fighting Irish I mean how many legends of the game were on the sideline in the ACC and and hung it up And and thats why making its its not just getting a hire that you think can work but its making the right hires and and seeing that transfer over to the court cuz you can flip it pretty quick All this talk of transfer portal and guys that are available you you change your roster now overnight And put back and the first points for the freshman Jaylen Harelson the McDonalds AllAmerican and much more on his plate in the absence of Marcus Burton for Notre Dame And hes answered it He two 20 uh he has 20 point games in three out of the last four contests And if theyre going to be successful tonight he has to get over 20 foul and Benny Geler of Stanford in the first whistle against the Carton Harelson Anderson Indiana native that huge shot to force overtime in Fort Worth in that big overtime win Notre Dame had at TCU but the role hes been on recently in the absence of Burton and with the ankle injury sidelining the arguably one of the best point guards in the It just its the next man up mentality but it still hurts right I mean they theres certain guys that are really difficult to replace and and he is certainly one for the Irish in Burton that it changes the way they want to approach the game Burton was so good off the bounce Now you got to play through the post a little bit more to try to create some different kind of matchups And so youre making that adjustment on the fly Freshman Brady Kaylor with the miss Down low they go to Oscar Hilte the freshman from Belgium Thats a dangerous pass that should have been stolen Brad transfer from the division 2 ranks and a deep three Jeremy Smith and the offensive rebound Hell take you a fresh 20 for the Cardinal One thing Notre Dames done a good job of is boxing in Accorey He has not gotten free and turned the corner to get downhill at all yet trying to create stick back three That was off the mark and a foul going for the rebound as Donovan Young of Stanford pushed off A lot of talk about a Cory and is he an NBA pro type player Like a little bit undersized right Like for for the the next level but if hes going to be that guy the scoring numbers jump off the page Hes got to get more consistent from the threepoint line And that is one aspect of his game he needs to continue to grow at as is his distribution of the ball and and being a playmaker for others Averaging almost 23 points a game as thats a clock issue and why why we have a stoppage But hes averaging three assists a game And youd like to see that higher Yeah Id like to see it higher because hes going to get whether its the next level or now hes going to be putting more on ball screen situations hes going to have to read those screens and be able to facilitate the offense for somebody else You know he he is a phenomenal talent and you know broke the freshman scoring single game scoring record with 32 points against Colorado a game that you called and then goes for 30 again the next game out against Northridge and the first player to do that in a Cardinal uniform since Landry Fields Its been a minute Backto back 30point games for Ibuka Okori On the baseline the floater rims off from Sir Mohamd but kept alive by the Irish Thats the third offensive rebound by Tal Thats what hes in there to do Grab boards One of the best rebounders in the country Fact he led the country in rebounding per game last year as Auko Cory runs down the miss And they talked about every time A Cororey touches the ball they want him to see multiple blue jerseys They do not want to allow him to see a scene Hooked out of bounds by Notre Dame Nine on the timer for the Cardinal And hes seeing that every time he has the ball Sean not only is the primary defender right now its Logan IMS but theyre running a second defender to force him to get rid of the basketball and getting in gaps in the back line of that defense too Like the interior presence of Stanford isnt going to overwhelm you right So you can kind of show a little bit more and get back Loose ball in the paint Ding for Carson Touts come away with it Hes got to do a better job taking care of the ball the two losses that they have he has 11 turnovers in those two games combined And hes gotten a little sloppy with it early here 10 to shoot for Notre Dame Down low to Carson Tout and the jump hook by Tout off the heel of the rim and it goes Carson Tout already with six He he just plays so physical You know we talk about his offensive rebound The other key that he does is he sets monster screens for this offense and sets them often in the half court set to try to open up his teammates and in doing so often he finds himself open Second straight season tout has played here at Maples Pavilion Last year with Northern Arizona he played here nonconference early in the year in a big Stanford win as Maxim Reo went off in that game for the Cardinal attacking back the other way Spins out for Shrewberry But theres Carson Town hustling to keep it alive for Notre Dame And Town he took a shot May have gotten popped in the nose and hes trying to gather himself now But Carson Tout having an impact for the Irish Yeah six straight points for Notre Dame and were not up at 10 But Carson Tout has been the brute strength and toughness underneath for the Irish create a little space get the friendly roll ACC play mentality for Notre Dame And what they want him to see is every time he touch touches the ball multiple bodies between him and the basket not allowing him to have a seam They dont want to create any cheap fouls And because of that he has not been aggressive Now has not gotten to the free throw line Has not gotten downhill one single time so far in the first nine minutes of this game Tied at 10 and Notre Dame All 10 points coming in the paint as the Irish and a kick and a block shot Jeremy Den Smith racing back the other way and he has a shot blocked by Braden Shrewberry Here come the Irish Sir Mohamd attacks and hes called for carrying the basketball and Notre Dame turns it right back over to Stanford This is a great block shot against a very good defensive player for the Irish football team the debut for Mark Zachary IVth with the Notre Dame basketball team tonight Hes first minutes for him He joined the team obviously shorthanded at the guard position with Burton being out He made three starts this year in the secondary for Marcus Freeman and a three spins out for Chisumak Par All 10 of the points for Notre Dame have come in the paint Uh theyve been very patient and theyve worked off these screens and been very deliberate Stanford has missed their last eight shots from the field Sir Mohamd Seven to shoot for the Irish Mohamd off one foot rolls off Offensive rebound and a put back underneath Kevin Jai gives Notre Dame the lead Seven offensive rebounds right now for Notre Dame and theyve been outstanding with an 80 run taking this lead and theyve done it with heart strength and hustle Theyre just going after the offensive glass and and theyre punishing Stanford right now Its going to be D Smith missing from deep and the long rebound there is Kevin Jai for the Irish I mean this spurt is over six plus minutes Is it really a run though What Its eight nothing over that stretch Ryan Agarwal losing his balance and a foul got undercut by Sir Mohamd and the foul called against Notre Dame Starting ringing in the new year tomorrow afternoon Two more conference matchups right here on ESPN 2 and the ESPN app is NC State hosting Wake Forest and Raleigh Thats at noon Eastern And then Syracuse Clemson Great afternoon of hoops to get you ready to celebrate 2026 Syracuse ACC hoops Syracuse could be getting back Donnie Freeman uh whos been limited just to four games this year Hes expected to potentially back for that game against Clemson That would be a huge boost for the Orange who have had to rely on their freshman a ton Dumped inside AJ Roi spinning underneath Raosi couldnt convert and the rebound grabbed by Kevin Jai for Notre Dame Jai with great defense walling up not fouling Shrewberry off the screen offensive rebound The tip out losing the handle was Mark Zachary Picked up though by Notre Dame Harrelson spins on Ryan Count it and one Jaylen Harrelson for the Irish you see exactly the game plan for Notre Dame where they want to get the ball and you know coach talked about the details and losing the details in that game against Purdue Fort Wayne that that carryover from what is the game plan how you want to execute it and how you feel you can be successful and it is clear what Notre Dame has wanted to do throughout the course of this game and that is get the ball deep in the paint and then play out of it off of it and they have found a ton of success in that regard whether its offensive rebound downs post ups forcing the back line of the defense to have to step up and rotate Harelson missing the free throw short Benny Geler chases down the rebound for Stanford But 10 straight points for Notre Dame and the largest lead for the Fighting Irish again Two bodies chasing Ibuka Okore down low AJ Rahosi was wide open on the catch He wasnt ready to score Aiden Cam flips it in for the Cardinal talking about conference play and and the race to a regular season conference championship is on Fall away missed by Braden Shrewberry but tipped in by the Irish Stanfords got to start putting a body on somebody in a blue jersey when the shot goes up The rebound Jaylen Harelson the only person there for Notre Dame By the way first points for Garrett Sundra that last tippet It is 188 on the glass right now in favor of Notre Dame And Stanford on the season is plus six per game Theyre a good rebounding team but its the offensive rebounds thatll really frustrate Kyle Smith that theyre giving up Jaylen Harlson spins back middle and the foul on Aiden Cam And to your point Roxy in staying with what has worked for Notre Dame its its the plus 10 on the glass But the reality is they have more offensive rebounds in this game than Stanford has And when youre on your home floor youve got to box out and you have to rebound And you know there is something when you when you lose that you start to you start to sense it before it comes And thats one of the things that we talked about with Notre Dame today is the fact that that some of the issues that that emerged in that game They were leaking game by game and growing game by game And when you get popped and you lose one that you shouldnt lose and they should not have lost that game When you lose that all of a sudden youve got to hit the reset button But it gives coach the opportunity to show video And their first practice back it was hey no offense Were getting back to the details of what we have to do defensively and Ive been really impressed how theyve kept the Cory in check so far and then how theyve rebounded the ball so far in this game 16 points in the paint for Notre Dame already in this game Deflected out by the Irish and it belongs to Stanford on the baseline 10 nothing Notre Dame in second chance points so far And they have been aggressive and attacking and its clear they learned from that loss to Purdue Fort Wayne You come out to the Bay Area and if youre youre able to get two wins boy that that flight home back to Southbend is going to feel a lot different than it felt the last time he took the floor Theres no doubt Buco Cory had it stripped picked up by Carson Tout as Notre Dame takes it away That was the first time he had a scene for him to be able to drive And a good job with that little deflection away to strip him before he could get up to a shot Irish on a 132 run Jayen Harelson moves in and a ball thats on Chisum Aara got him with the body the first on a car And just watch little stepping in with the hip That that second one right there is what drew the foul Carson Tout after he was popped in the nose has the cotton ball up there to stop the bleeding I was Marcus Freeman I mean start calling about tout and see Ill give you Zachary for the basketball season Can I get tout for the football season Cory glides in the first points for the freshman tonight And those first points came against an unset defense out in transition and Stanford would like to see more of that Deflected by Ibuka Okori Thats why it was okay for Logan Ives to go into the back court to get her And thats the second on Chisumak Par with 541 left in the half You get the opportunity to score when you can create a turnover and then run and in transition you got to try to stop ball that shrinks the defense to that middle third and Aorei did a great job running that left lane and just filling it First points of the night for Ibuka Okorei double figures all 11 games already with seven 20point games He missed a couple of games with an ankle injury for Stanford Cole Serta Carson T the kick out Jaylen Harelson missing the three and there is Ibuko Cory tipping the rebound Stanford control What I like there is theres multiple white jerseys going for that defensive rebound Everybodys starting to track the ball a little bit and Im sure that Kyle Smith was talking to his team saying were getting pounded on the glass We if we turn off the second chance opportunities we can get back into this game really quickly cuz while things have gone very well for Notre Dame they havent been able to create great separation here at all in the first half despite the long drought that Stanford suffered through Although the Cardinal did buy lead by as many as six early in this game Last touch by Oscar Heilte of Stanford It belongs to Notre Dame 5 minutes to go in the half and the physicality in the inside play of Notre Dame right now has been the theme and why they have this lead and theyve been attacking and aggressive against Stanford tonight Well and then theyve theyve forced Stanford to have to play out over the top with contested shots Stanford is just two for their last 14 from the field Fouled on a three Cole Serta will head to the line and its on Benny Geler his second He does such a good job I like sort of And then hes kind of a connector offensively He cuts with purpose along the baseline If youre ball watching defensively he gets most of his threes off of drives and relocates And if he puts it down hes going to want to drive to the rim But that time a catch and shoot situation and earns himself three at the free throw line Hes now 23 for 23 at the line this season The second most made free throws in the country without a miss One more coming for Cole Serta These teams played once last year was in South Bend and Cole Certa had the gamewinning shot in a twopoint Notre Dame win over Stanford in early March cheering Now 25 for 25 at the line this year Its a lot like you You were out here between shoot rounds I mean what you make 150 in a row The problem is if you make me move Yeah Especially these days AJ Rahosi trying to go up over the pack in the lane and the Irish come away with it Sir Mohamd contact inside as Logan I trying to take it in strong Last touched by Stanford and it belongs to Notre Dame on the baseline and Kyle Smith contemplating challenging this And Kyle Smith he he you know he was looking for a staff to look at it They didnt even have it up and he said you know were going to go ahead and look at it anyways on the floor to do that Jones or Cy Stand Im glad you brought that up Its a Its an astute point by USA Anytime you bring up a Hawaiian memory youll take it Deep three short from Cole Sera but another offensive rebound The 11th offensive rebound for the Irish Shot missed inside by Sir Mohamd and a foul Its on Carson Tout going for the rebound It belongs to Stanford I I want to go back to that last play though and this is the video challenge Heres the play that went out of bounds Obviously the challenge was lost by Stanford but this is where you as a coach your staff needs to get on the same page Watch Kyle Smith as he stands up and he looks at the reaction of everybody else Hes believing he goes Should we review it Should we review it I want to talk to my staff Should we review it The person that has the iPad doesnt even have it in their hand So now theyre trying to pull it out and try to look at the play And Kyles like Never mind Were going to go ahead and challenge this thing And hopefully you you get the win If not you you lose your challenge right for the remainder of the game And thats probably more significant than the the use it and lose it timeout that he lost But thats part of this whole new technology in college basketball and staffs needing to be in tune with their head coach and being able to look at those plays quickly Oscar Heelte denied and Notre Dame comes away with it And the challenge was deemed unsuccessful by Stanford cost them a timeout and their ability to challenge for the remainder of the game as Sir Mohamed gets his own miss Had a strip Oscar he comes away with short armed the first one Jeremy Dench Smith transition three too strong out of bounds to Notre Dame But Stanford right now just stuck in struggling from the floor And theyre struggling because of what Notre Dames doing though like Notre Dame its its tough to run out when every time a shot goes up the Irish are getting the offensive rebound and second chance So you cant leak out So that keeps everybody close to the basket right Then second of all the defensive transition and the effort from Notre Dame has been really strong here in the first half and getting back and making sure that theyre closing out the driving lanes Stford is one for nine from three Deflected out stays with Notre Dame ESPN Womens College Hoops triple header Hatton the legendary Stanford coach retired just a couple of years ago as the rebound ripped down by Cameron Grant Stber 12 and two this year four straight wins including a ranked win over number 22 Washington going to that game against North Carolina Cameron Grant nails an open three and the walk on Grant giving a spark to Kyle Smith Up and under Shot inside Missed by Garrett Sundra Stanford The rebound and a foul Its on Sir Mohamd His second applause A second threepointer made by Stanford on the game Good ball movement That two run the ball creates that long close out back And if your feet are set and youre ready to get into that shooters pocket go ahead and let it rip And thats what they did One of the things I want to point out too about why Notre Dame has this lead still and its down to three points right Whats one of the ways that Stanford scores a ton of points Getting to the free throw line Roxy theyve attempted two free throws here in the first half So not only you not allowing the driving lanes youre not committing any silly fouls Cameron Grant missing that shot from deep but a foul will stay at this end And its called on Jaylen Harelson of Notre Dame Little heat check He made one as Grant his dad Chris former GM of the Cleveland Cavaliers Team fell number six on Notre Dame Next one will put Stanford into the bonus Grant launches and the rebound falls to Braden Shrewbury for Notre Dame That was probably one that Kyle Smith would have rather him just catch and and set up the offense and make sure you have a good possession Jaylen Harelson up and under Nice move and finish with a left hand from Jaylen Harelson who has seven to lead all scorers in the game When he has a smaller guard on him or someone he feels he can overpower thats exactly where hes going to go pass from Jeremy Denmith deflected by Notre Dame Seven on the shot clock for Stanford Roxy you go back to that Purdue Fort Wayne game for Notre Dame They trailed for 35 minutes and 25 seconds in that game and a lot of that had to do with just losing their integrity at the defensive end of the floor They they have been very much so dialed in here in the first half of this contest 18 plus minutes Been very impressed with their how detail oriented theyve been and how committed theyve been to that process Thats why theyve been able going on the road in conference play You get wins on the road in conference play It its it feels like you win two games D3 Jeremy Dent Smith the miss and the rebound secured by Kebai for the Irish Fivepoint lead for Notre Dame Stanford now two for 13 from deep Loose ball diving for it Jeremy Den Smith poked it out of bounds Seven on the shot clock for Notre Dame Well and a big part of the reason why Notre Dames got the win the lead so far is the fact that theyve shut the water off for Ibuka Cororey his numbers for the season of the best scores in all of college basketball and he has just two points here in the first first half of this game and for Stanford for them to win games in the ACC Ibuki has to be sensational Open three missed by Garrett Sandra Stanford the rebound Here comes Ibuka Okori Deep three again from Grant and the rebound grabbed by Kev Jai and Notre Dame can play for the last shot of the half and a timeout The use it or lose it timeout for Micah Shrewberry Fivepoint lead for the Irish Theyre setting up the last shot of the first 20 This and you can slip through the defense like a slip slippery salamander But then theres other times where you just got to overpower them And Notre Dames done a great job of being strong playing off of two getting on the offensive glass getting second chance points manufacturing extra possessions and being aggressive and scoring the ball in the paint And 16 of their 22 have come inside the paint in this game in the first half Stanford has only seven points in the last 16 minutes yet theyre only down five You are such a glass half full guy as were closing out 2025 and I appreciate that about you Roxy Trying to look at a positive for Kyle Smith Heres a three and a good look too strong from Braden Shrewberry and the rebound grab by Donovan Young Thatll take us to halftime It wasnt the most aesthetically pleasing first 20 minutes Sean but a tightly contested game between the Irish and Stanford to start conference play If youre Stanford right now youre going to locker room Youve got to hit a reset button You got to be able to rebound a lot better in the second half but I think you feel okay that youre only down by five Halftime score Notre Dame 22 Stanford 17 in the ACC opener for both Coming up the K Jewelers halftime report Zuben Malcolm and Seth in studio four shooting in the first half and only two points He needs to get freed up And one of the best ways to free him up in the second half Roxy is have somebody else make some shots and and force that defense to have to stay at home a little bit and not be able to overhelp and try to get the ball out of his hands as fast as possible Stanford just two for 15 from three That ball kicked away by Chisum Apara And Stanford begins the second half with a turnover And it goes over to Notre Dame who led by as many as six in the first half of this game Oh thats the third turnover for Akara Hes got half of their turnovers The question for Stanford is did you get tougher at halftime because that change to the lineup Oscar Heel started the second half for Kyle Smith Carson Tams it home just like the start of the first half First buck of the game was Tal come out of the break Good screen and he dives so well and carves out space in the paint Largest lead of the night for Notre Dame fly by Now Benny Geler has space Three Well that three happened because the shot fake lifted the defense and Shrewsbury had to stay with Aquari rather Aorei a little bit longer and that opened up the wide open threepoint cuz it was a long close out to get back Now three for 16 from deep Stanford a team that shoots 36 on their threes overall this season The lowest scoring half for the Cardinal here in the first half against Notre Dame is the miss by Braden Shrewberry and its out of bounds to Stanford Well weve talked about him right from the start of the game Tout does such a good job He sets that screen and dives right to the rim Nobody tags the the rim run and theyre late getting back and that that means its an easy dunk at the cup Jes weaves his way inside Throws up a wild shot Well defended Carson Town pulls it down Here come the Irish The pace of this game is perfect for Notre Dame Just very deliberate foul Count it and one Jaylen Harelson He He gets you on the hip and he locks you basically in jail here Watch as he turns the corner Hes going to get him on the hip And as soon as hes getting him right there he knows he can initiate the contact Hes going to get the foul And by initiating that contact hes able to stay composed up top and get his shoulders and that touch off the glass to make it an N1 opportunity Freshman at the line one for three tonight now two for four as Notre Dame has matched their largest lead of the game Benny Keeler on the drive heading inside the scoop McCory cant get the tip in off his own miss and Notre Dame comes away with it One of the rare times they didnt bring anybody else to the ball when a Cory got his hands on it and he immediately went to attack which is what he should have done Just unable to finish had a frustrating night for the freshman from Stanford Notre Dame has made life difficult for Ibuka Okori tonight Seven to shoot for the Irish Jaylen Harlson drives and reverse by Harelson Well hes got a match up right now like he feels that he can he can win that oneonone matchup and and the the helpside rotations on the backside of the defense for Stanford have not been clean And because of that they theyve been late and Notre Dame has opened this thing up to a 9point lead here doing exactly what they did in the first half continuing to get downhill and attack the pain of the Cardinal Not the case for the two guys that have been the most aggressive for the Irish tonight Jaylen Harrelson leads everybody with 12 Chisamak Par and he was well defended The shot blocked and Notre Dame runs it back the other way Goes off of Carson Tout out of bounds No theyre saying it stays with Notre Dame at this end Stanford does not have a challenge They blew it in the first half when theyre unsuccessful That was one they would have won Yeah that appeared to go off touts late No I take it back The officials got it right They always get it right Maris Pedigrew was right there and had the correct call It was off of Donovan Young Did you think they were always right when you were playing No really Carson Town pulls out another offensive rebound Irish just feasting on the glass Tough spin in the cav and a travel going for the rebound as Oscar heel t fell down cheering Frustrated Kyle Smith at the other end of the floor Hell take slots it out of bounds and stays in Notre Dame for Stanford Cardinal team that has been fluid offensively averaging 82 points per game They have just 20 points almost 24 minutes into this game Notre Dame has been outstanding defensively and have been the tougher more physical team They have brought the fight to this contest Haroldson spinning he the rebound One of the things where Stford has hung their hat on has been the ability to get to the free throw line Roxy still just two free throws in this game and they ranked 12th in the nation in free throws attempted per contest and they only have two so far tonight Not only is Notre Dame defending but theyre defending without fouling Theyre not allowing Stanford to manufacture points or build confidence by getting to the free throw line Five to shoot Logan I tries the scoop and it spins in the first points for I Logan I after that game against Purdue Fort Wayne said we can get over this by going and winning two in the Bay Area we have to win two games in the Bay Area and his team is executing that type of clip a 70 run right now for Notre Dame up double digits and a foul in the post second on Carson Town but Notre Dame in control does Stanford have an Sir happy holidays from the farm Hes an average from the field Its just been great connectivity and there has been no island It has been a we mentality defensively and their rotations have been extremely crisp And augo Cory just two points one for six from the floor Shot clock at five for Stanford Cameron Grant throws up a desperation heave and the rebound grabbed inside by Kevin Jai for the Irish Its one shot and out and usually one missed shot and out Shot clock down to five Braden Shrewsbury deep three and a rebound diving forward out of bounds Notre Dame ball Last touch by Stanford in the corner Every 5050 ball right I mean just just every 5050 ball A couple good efforts here to try to go drag it down but seems like every time theres a loose ball it ends up going back to Notre Dame Fresh 20 on the shot clock Tough spot to inbound for Jaylen Harelson In addition to physicality that Notre Dame has brought they controlled Temple controlled the block and a foul Its on Donovan Young of Stanford And that will send Jaylen Harelson to of on those drives in spinning initiating contact getting in the body of the defensive player and manufacturing opportunities for himself to score But seven fouls drawn already by number 10 in blue Two for four at the line for Harelson A game high 12 points screaming Freshman have you covered in the cheese at Citrus Bowl And back on ESPN the SRS distribution Las Vegas Bull Nebraska number 15 Utah 330 Eastern You see Vannys quarterback Diego Pavia That game is taking place in Tampa Showed up at a WWE event over the weekend Shocking that you would notice that as AJ Roi has his shot blocked Well he helped Rey Mysterio win the match It was a big time move by the quarterback Thats a big time shot They havent had to use a lot of the threepoint shot today because theyve dominated so much in the paint But Stanford just cant score I mean its really that simple They cannot score Its a 100 run again for Notre Dame Cameron Grant off of the three hustling Donovan Young Grabs the rebound and a Notre Dame foul Well it starts as it does so frequently at the defensive end of the floor Just great position defense Thats a great block shot Jordan Cornett has got to be thrilled watching that But good ball movement Break down the defense by driving it It collapses the defense You stop ball watching All of a sudden now you relocate on the outside You get a high percentage look from beyond the threepoint look Art Another drought for Stanford of over 6 minutes They have three points since halftime Its rained a lot here in Northern California There is no more drought up here Just just here tonight on the court Jeremy D Smith was tripped on his way to the basket Stanford thirsting for some points Ros and look this is a team you mentioned it almost 82 points per contest shooting 36 from beyond the arc on the season averaging almost nine made threes Theyre outstanding at getting to the free throw line tonight Nothing has allowed them to find any kind of rhythm or flow to get some consistency and and right now if youre Stanford you could we can talk about the offensive struggles and obviously the offensive struggles have have assisted the Irish in their ability to have success but they theyve got to close down the paint and theyve got to try to get stops on a consistent Can you get three stops on a row You want to get back in this game youre down by 12 get three stops in a row start with that and see if that will help maybe ignite something offensively cuz they have not gotten any turnovers They havent been able to run and get out in transition and play in front of the defense except for a couple of possessions over the course of this game Jeremy Dan Smith two free throws and a Stanford drought of over six minutes Nice take to the basket Brady Kaylor another one of these terrific freshman for Micah Shrewsbury A great class that hes brought in Its a 14point lead again for Notre Dame He came off the bench knocked down that three and then shows you the versatility able to drive and and finish with ease Benny Keeler from deep Too strong on the three and the rebound grabbed by Sir Mohamd for the Irish Mohamd tries to turn the corner Match up feels like he can go after right there Corner three Thats been too strong with the put back underneath Brady Taylor I I bet you theres going to be some rebounding done at practice tomorrow for Stanford It just theyre not putting a body on anybody I mean youre just ri running The shot goes up Some of the best offense that Notre Dames had Just throw it up against the glass and see what happens Second foul and Cole Serta of Notre Dame And Brady Kaylor has done that I just step out on the floor and be active Move without the basketball Get your feet set Have your shot ready on the catch Seven points and two rebounds Three or four shooting tonight And all seven of those points have been the last seven points scored by Notre Dame And they have just frustrated Stanford In the second half Cardinal just one for 10 from the field IO Cory just cant get a look Tries to create spins it up and in Four points now tonight for Ibuko Cororey averaging just under 23 a game See if that can maybe ignite him and get him going a little bit I think you we talked about others trying to score to kind of open up his game He might have to force the issue a little bit to get going offensively like he did on that possession Taylor in and out on the baseline The rebound run down by Ibuka Okorei ready to pick him up immediately was Mark Zachary the fourth Chisamak par on the move missed the three and the rebound ripped down by Sir Mohamd for Notre Dame the first by Zachary and its not like Zachary was an unknown to Michael Shrewberry well go back to that because this is the first time Accors been able to come off of a screen have a little bit of space Zachary didnt get back in front of him He played him on his hip and that allowed that seam to drive and now the helpside rotation just a little bit late and that allowed a Cory to score Zachary making his Notre Dame debut tonight as a basketball player played football for the Irish this year as a drop off inside Carson Tout in the lane and its fumbled out of bounds by Garrett Sundra and it goes over to Stanford and the plan wasnt for Zachary initially to play basketball at Notre Dame He came in hes a football highly recruited defensive back but he did play a ball with Braden Shrewberry and Logan Ims So Micah Shrewsberry had seen him play for years Tremendous high school basketball player in the state of Indiana And with the injury to Marcus Burton it precipitated the move to get Zachary out on the basketball court Well and I asked our good friends at Notre Dame I said Whens the last time you had a football and basketball player They came back with Joe Howard who was a wide receiver on the football team music back in the early 80s Was the last time they had a football and basketball player in the same season Stanfords had a bunch of them over the years Heres IO Cory on the drive hangs and challenged by Carson Town Play volleyball inside AJ Roi pulls it down Foul on Carson Town whos in disbelief Third on Tal This is what Stanford needs Well he needs energy Hey energy first of all is the first aspect of any kind of effort and youve got to be able to bring a little bit of that fight and some good scrap on that possession The foul going for the rebound Its on AJ Roi after the Jeremy Dent Smith missed from deep One of the things I would do if I was Stanford Id start pressing You got to speed up this game You got to create more First of all you got to sometimes manufacture your own energy start your own engine And it looks like theyre actually going to do it But I would do this because you got to create more possessions Youve got to try to speed up a Notre Dame team whos done a really good job of valuing the basketball tonight Only six turnovers I would look to double trap Youve been getting pounded in the paint anyway So like might as well try to create something else to see if you can get a do something different because what youre doing is not working Jaylen Harlson Hes going to get fouled here and the block shot Good defense from Donovan Young Loose ball picked up in the key The miss Garrett Sundra and its Donovan Young pulling it down and Stanford looking to push it Go downhill and go Ibuki and hes fouled Well get to the line And the first trip to the free throw line tonight for Ibuka Okorei First on Kebachai Okorei an 81 foul shooter a a 14point deficit with 9 minutes and 16 seconds is not something you cant overcome It just kind of feels like it might be too much to overcome based off the fact that offensively they havent had any success whatsoever But you look at a Cory and what hes been able to accomplish Number of fouls in which hes drawn the trips to the free throw line such an uncharacteristic night so far tonight being limited in his opportunities to get to the foul line Finally making his first free throw of the game 10 to shoot for Notre Dame Jaylen Harlson lost it picked up Here comes Abuko Cory The crossover the scoop the laying Abuko core is starting to get it going for Stanford Turnover and opportunity again to play against an unset defense And one of the things that Notre Dames done a great job of is valuing the basketball And if you want to open up a door of opportunity for Stanford to get back in turn the ball over and allow them to score in transition And Aores kind of turned it up a little bit here in the last couple of minutes And they got to shut his water back off Hes up to seven points on the night Stanford has cut it to 11 It was 16 for Notre Dame Logan IMS into the key Jayen Harelson and a reach in foul number three on Donovan Young Foul number eight drawn by Harelson tonight He He spins so frequently I mean as a defensive player you have to understand when he gets to the paint he is going to want to spin And if you reach your hand out then as hes spinning hes getting to the foul line Problem is hes just two for seven from the line cheering and applause Harelson 68 on the season coming in Not a great shooter Hes a good finisher around the basket Hes 0 for eight from three on the season Goes one for two and a 12point lead for Notre Dame 815 to play Oort and a foul Its on Garrett Sundra and Stanford will go to the line Theyre in the bonus Irish by 12 ACC opener on the farm Yes were struggling with Louisville across the bay tonight in that conference opener at Hos Pavilion One thing you both Cal and Stanford have such great aquatics programs The water polo programs at both of those two schools So elite cheering applause I felt like when I was walking by the pool today here and then you see the caps in the water Im thinking theres probably eight Olympians Im going to see in 2028 Los Angeles in the water right now swimming Although I know youre biased to the womens soccer program at Cal I am partial to that program 10point lead for Notre Dame Stanford has tried to speed up the Irish and make him uncomfortable The Notre Dame is sticking to the game plan Five to shoot for the Irish Carson Town hands it off Braden Shrewsbury Tough fadeaway three in and out and the rebound Oscar Heilte for the Cardinal A chance to get into single digits Kind of force the issue if youre number one in white right now I look to go aggressively off this screen Get into the body Try to get to the free throw line Every time youre fouled youre going to the free throw line for the remainder of this game Chisumak Par off on the three Offensive rebound Jeremy Den Smith for Stanford Deep three way off Rabuko Cory There is Chisumak par for the Cardinal Double clutches and well challenged Good defense from Carson Tal And now you got a number situation Logan short on that three and Ibuko Cory runs down the rebound Donovan Young in transition YOUNG TO THE BASKET FIRST POINTS of the season for Donovan Young cheering Young who missed the first 12 games with a lower leg injury made his season debut at Stanfords last game this past Saturday against CESA Youre starting to see Stanford though be able to get freed up and score in transition Missed Great Shrewberry Here comes Chisum Park Hell attack Fouled will get to the line And the foul is on Logan Ives and Notre Dame So the one thing about this game is is as as many positives as Notre Dame has had points in the paint their defense overall theyve never been able to really create that that massive separation that you you would expect when a team starts the second half one of 10 shooting They did get it to 16 but Notre Dame cheering then they went into a funk offensively and thats opened the door for Stanford and now its a 10 to1 run So this is the first run Stanford has had the whole game Now its 11 to1 run for Stanford and Aara leads the Cardinal with 10 and from 16 Stanford has cut it to six and a turnover by Notre Dame cheering and applause Jeremy Den Smith to the basket D Smith powers it up and in And its Notre Dame by four Eight straight for the Cardinal 131 is the run to climb back into the game Well part of that has been theyve done a really good job defending their own glass right A much better job of limiting second chance points opportunities for Notre Dame during this stretch Its one and done and being able to push off of that and be able to score in transition And this just a strong move from a guy that was a twotime allAmerican at the division 2 level The grad transfer from Cal State Dominguez Hills Jeremy Dent Smith 15 foul found the card to the first on Dan Smith Here is Jaylen Harelson out of the double team cheering Great Shrewberry up top Garrett Sundra rattles in a three Huge for the Irish Big threepoint shot there and good job relocating creating just enough space to get that clean look off Desperately needed by Notre Dame Oscar Hilte down low Chisumak par la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la launching answer right back cheering That was a great job playing off the post entry 4 and 12 minutes remain Jaylen Harlson out top Seven to shoot Garrett Sundra Backto back threes for Sundra off balance of Cory missed everything and Notre Dame controls Couple of clutch threes have withstood this Stanford push and Carson Town lost the handle Out of bounds Irish give it back to Stanford 347 to go Sevenpoint lead for Notre Dame Garrett Sundra doing such a good job of relocating this That little slide there changes the direction of the close out Gives him a free clean look Comes right back down the next possession Feet set long range Bang Hits it from the outside And it has been a poor showing offensively for Stanford but Notre Dames defense a big reason why And for example Brad Shrewar he hasnt scored tonight His defense has been spectacular Hes guarded with Buco Cory for a lot of the game Benny Geler Even though he hasnt scored hes had an impact for Notre Dame So little of the game is actual scoring Step through Oscar Heay had it poked out of bounds 11 on the shot clock for Stanford Roxy even the best players like Ibuk Cory has has you know scored over 60 points in the last two games The percentage of the time the ball is actually in his hands while hes out on the court is such a small number How can you impact winning in other ways And to your point about Shrewsbury is his defense is hes been in a stance Hes been communicating talking made some really good passes offensively that have led to assists Oscar Hilte rattles out and the rebound Jaylen Harelson for Notre Dame Sanford from 16 down made a push They cut it to four The lead is seven Harelson traveled That is his seventh turnover Hes done a lot of things really well tonight but one of them is not valuing the basketball in particular here in the second half Turnover minutes to go Turnovers by the way could be key in that 49er game against the Hawks Joselyn is working with him back in Bristol Just want to let her know Sam Darnolds going to turn that thing over a couple times If Brock P is going to score the Niners going to get that one seed It would be remarkable the ners considering having been through Ibuko Cororey launching a three Oscar Heilte on the offensive glass fouled on a putback and hell go to the line Fourth on Carson Tout and team foul number 10 That means Stanford is in the double bonus for the rest of the night Hell the freshman 62 from the strike Part of the reason why Sanfords been able to get back into this game is theyve gotten to the free throw line much more frequently here in the second half than they did in the first half Only two free throws in the first 20 minutes This will be their 10th free throw attempted here in the second half We mentioned it clears throat They 12th in the country in free throws attempted per game And the freshman from Belgium hits both Fivepoint lead for the Irish 242 to go Harelson way out top moves in and he stepped on the end line Its another giveaway He he might be the best offensive weapon as far as being able to score with his back to the basket in these drives but hes been dribbling to nowhere lately and and now you you step out of bounds on the end line very close but definitely goes over the top of that line just enough and youre having empty possessions Empty possessions continue to open the door even with two minutes left for Stanford And theres a lot more on the plate of Jaylen Harelson in the absence of Marcus Burton For sure And Marcus Burton would be the guy that has his hands on the ball every single possession right now Lo Cory throws up a wild shot Terrific defense from Logan Ives And Shrewbury did a nice job cracking back in from the guard position on the weak side to grab that rebound Now you can be patient here a little bit offensively Inside 10 to shoot Hines drives Corner three Too strong from Jaylen Harelson Out of bounds Stanford ball 85 seconds to go in a twopossession game And you know because he got the ball so late in that shot clock Didnt necessarily have time to shot fake and drive to the rim As I mentioned Harelson is now 0 for9 from the season from beyond the arc Kyle Smith wants a timeout 145 123 left to go Its a twopossession game right But that that would be including a threepoint shot If youre Stanford half is what theyre looking at The the clock should not have started until right then And so theyre going to look to see if theyre going to adjust at all I dont think that theyre going to I think they stopwatched it I think were fine But you look where this league is at Eight teams are among the top 40 in the net Nine are 10 and two or better And that means quality of wins increases from where it was a season ago in in a massive direction moving it in in the right way Heres Ibuka Okori Got to go Chismak para in and out on the three and the rebound knocked free by Carson Tout grab Logan Ims and Notre Dame controls Well if youre Stanford you have some fouls to give here And they take one at midc court The first on Ibuka McCory If youre going to foul Harelsons the guy you want to put on the line the way he has shot free throws tonight And hes on the floor And so for me let him catch the ball and then foul him Hes probably going to touch it on this possession As soon as he touches it you just foul him Cole Serta is not a guy I want to foul if Im Stanford Next one will put Notre Dame at the line Id run two to the ball and try to get them to get it to Harelson Forced way out Three to shoot for the Irish I a fadeaway shot nearly banked it in Donovan Young the rebound Go downhill You got to go Benny Geler way out there and the rebound all over the glass Jaylen Harlson Thats the guy who wanted a foul but Stanford let it get out of his hands And now youre putting a guy at the line who hasnt missed a free throw all season Great learning experience for Ibuka Cory And you see Kyle Smith say Hey we flatten that thing out for you to go And he didnt and he gave it up And I think this young freshman as talented as he is hes going to have to be the guy in those moments understanding time and possession how to be aggressive and assert himself into this game Foul was on Donovan Young Cole Sera three for three from the line tonight He is 25 for 25 on the season with 189 to go and Notre Dame up five Hes got a chance to make this a threepos possession game I mean how simple is his routine I mean that great free throw shooters just have this confident routine that is repeatable And you watch Serta he gets the ball in his hands he puts it down gets it right in that shooting pocket and lets it lets it rip One more for Serta and he rattles it in He actually hit the rim but theres no hesitation I mean just what a weapon to have by the way in late game situations Hell check out for the defense and the rebounding but would go back into the game on an offensive substitution if they need it Now a sevenpoint lead for Notre Dame Looking for that bounce back from the loss before Christmas to Purdue Fort Wayne And now the clock started and Stanford hadnt touched it yet and theyll have to redo it But its clear for Micah Shrewberry and Notre Dame his team got the message coming out of that loss I think defensively very pleased and I think if you told Kyle Smith by the way that Notre Dame would have 47 points he would think his teams going to win this contest He would sign up for it before the game even started Missed the three Chismak parr the rebound Notre Dame and the Irish looking to run out the clock and a foul will get Braden Shrewsbury to the line and its on Cameron Grant You talk about defense 24 shooting on the game for Stanford on their home floor One and one for Shrewberry 75 The son of the head coach looking for his first point of the night Came in averaging over 12 a game And it rips out Stanford the rebound Heres Ibuka Okorei Pulls up for three In and out And the rebound tipped out to Cororey Shot it too late And the ball game in Stanford is held at just 40 with a dominant suffocating defensive performance from the Fighting Irish tonight The details
