officials samat yigu Victor lockin get us started tigers with the ball and the small lineup if you will for brown L chony Wiggins comes off the bench Dylan Hunter who was terrific for Clemson last Saturday in Tallahassee on the floor heres older brother Chase into traffic tried to slip it through and it got knocked away taken on the turnover by BJ Edwards heres Chuck Harris teeing up an early Three cross inside the rebound SMU will get a second chance you see the line up for Andy infield in his first season here in Dallas as the head coach of the Mustangs double on yigao in the corner with eight to shoot Harris quickly for cross fre ball away back rim Miss and locken is the winner of the rebound and the tiger lineup we told you both Hunters on the floor with Zachary lockin and Ian shefflin heres sheflin out front yigo follows him from the manto man well both teams in manto man and SMU theyre noted for their offense but their defense can be pretty good and that is a great sign for the Tigers because Jaden Zachary he does a lot of things really well for clemon but shooting the three is not one of them great start for the Tigers 283 of the year for Zachary Tigers average nine threes a game thats third best in the ACC Edwards on the bounce for yigu locking there and Zachary digs down and knocks it away turnover on the Mustangs clearly thats part of the game plan to double team him every time he catches the ball and thrown away by shein trying to cross for Dylan Hunter Harris for cross on the drive Matt cross who turned 24 years of age yesterday gets the Mustangs on the board as I said their defense is better than it gets credit for theyre really good at stealing the ball you cannot throw a lazy crosscourt pass like that Hunter on the drive against a Kendo back for lock in three good Victor locken who dialed it up from behind the line against Carolina last week Dan has his 20th three and he shoots almost 50 in conference play from out there West if hes going to hit those thats going to bring yigu away from the basket and open things up in the middle for the Tigers cross with shefin defending a step back three bounces off yigu the offensive rebound and the stick back and this is an outstanding offensive rebounding team over here Clemson by two a pair of Threes one to Zachary and one to Music Lockett Dylan Hunter against aenda right back for lockin on the Block hell spin basket side up an under couldnt finish cross the rebound locken thought he got fouled SMU on the attack its really good help by cross cross calling foring against Chase Hunter and Harris throws it away West can we decide right now that those cross cook passes are a bad idea yep with these two they are Hunter attacks on the dribble yigao the contact Chase Hunter couldnt get the roll they got tapped around boy pretty good Tempo here earli a quendo on the drive and the Mustangs in front Wes its great Tempo and one thing weve seen Chase Hunter now has gotten into the lane twice and he has not been able to finish because of the presence of yigu heres Hunter on the drive again skip out front Zachary another three good Jaden Zachary just hitting a third of his threes on the year knocks down two here early Clemson back in front and West in conference play hes under 30 so those were two big baskets for the Tigers 96 Clemson three threes for the Tigers ss got three twopoint goals and now another turnover heres Hunter leading the break on Harris spins Glides cant finish shefin banged it around Zachary the recovery hell skip for Chase Hunter standing three thats good 65th three of the year for Chase Hunter his first Basket in a ball game and a half from the floor tigers not noted West for their ability to play in transition but theyve started in transition pretty well so far this afternoon doubled the number Brad ronell told us earlier we have to have a strong start Dan I think hes gotten it and so far four minutes and change gone first half seven to shoot a quendo Loops it here for cross four on the shot clock cross from Plano back rim Miss and last Touch by the Tigers and then he took the job of course last April 1st he was named their head coach he said we know weve got an environment here and so far that environment has held up five and three at home in the ACC and the losses are Wake Forest Duke and Louisville the Clemson number 18 in the country as Harris rattles in a three out of the timeout and thats the first SMU three Clemson has only four field goals but theyre all threes threepoint lead for the Tigers Dylan Hunter kick back for Lockett Victor on a high dribble out of the corner here is the Freshman Jones knocking down the three out of Landover Maryland Dell Jones had 13 minutes of action last Saturday at Tallahassee well and hes one of the six guys on this Clemson team in conference play who shoot better than who shoot at least 38 from out there Baseline run the bouncer of falls off the iron for BJ Edwards Clemson by six and Jones replaced Chase Hunter a moment ago in the lineup probably hits a three to keep the momentum going from behind the line for the Tigers heres shefin with cross defending skip out for Dylan Hunter hell cut cut loose at three front rim Miss barely got to the iron SMU trailing six in the ball but another wide open threepoint opportunity for the Tigers a quindo baseline Edwards on a hard drive quick Ball moving aindo was no time rattled out the three yigu and lockin was there yigu was there and its going to be on Victor lockin the senior transfer from anpa in Southwestern Russia is first and the first on the Tigers and Brad Brownell looks on in campaign number 15 Brad Brownell Dan has got 85 ACC wins since the 20171 18 season thats fourth best among the conference hes a little frustrated with his guys right now because theyre not doing a very good job on the defensive board so far SMU has dominated and that has created some problems for the Titans Harris trying to lean in skipped for cross eight to shoot for the Mustangs Harris traveled with it picked up on the ball before he delivered the pass and Wes this Clemson team theyre much better offensively particularly over the last few games but this remains an outstanding defensive team so far each team having a hard time penetrating the defense of the other one to your point theres second in the conference play in scoring defense theyre sixth in field goal percentage defense and second in three point field goal percentage defense heres Wiggins on the floor chy the Junior from Grayson Georgia at 611 eight to shoot for Jones on the drive lost the handle on it scooped up shefflin with four skips for Zachary another three yes wow Jaden Zacharys got nine that one beat the shot clock and Clemson back in front now by nine their largest lead of the first half that was a typical Ian chefin Play Just going to dig out the ball Clemson is six of seven from three all of their field goals are from behind the line three of them for Jaden Zachary and Wiggins is trying to guard yigu inside three by Harris is the answer for SMU Harris is their best threepoint shooter but yigu against Wiggins on the offensive end for SMU is a mismatch the Mustangs ought to be able to exploit 44 threepoint Shooters Harris sheelin trying to keep the Rob going and he does Ian sheelin another three my goodness Clemson is living behind the line here in the first almost 8 minutes of play well one reason is they cant get it inside but why do you need to Edwards on the drive got blocked partially kums out Mustangs now with cross and thats an offensive foul on Cross Matt cross the 2 fouryearold senior from Beverly Massachusetts his first and the first on the Mustangs and Clemson West you talk about the threes that theyre making but theyre getting wide open threes shefflin is a 40 threepoint shooter in conference play you cannot give him that much time and room sheflin will come out miles Foster checks in hes the grad transfer from Illinois State averaging a point and a half and a rebound in conference Club W but Ill tell you something yigu is not used to J and threepoint Shooters out beyond the line samat has taken a seat Jerel Colbert has checked in wearing number 20 for the Mustang theres Foster scoring his first points Dan since he had three last week at s at Florida State he had four against Carolina well hes he is a guy who knows how to play West he can score inside hes a good rebounder 11point lead for Clemson at 2312 was the Tigers first twopoint goal theres a drive and score for BJ Edwards Edwards doing a nice job getting to the basket as weve said weve seen very little of that so far in this game but Edwards using his quickness to get by Wiggins Chase Hunter working against AJ George Junior transfer from Long Beach State Wiggins out of the corner thats too strong an air ball Edwards the recovery on the back side Wiggins is a very good threepoint shooter particularly in that catch and shoot sit situation ball knocked out of bounds last Touch by Dylan Hunter thatll get us to a timeout 9 minutes into to this important game for the Mustangs and tigers continues in a moment Music pleas welcome your Music Applause Music Applause Music n e Music Music minutes for the Tigers Dan absolutely on the offensive end West they have made Seven threepoint baskets of their eight field goals five different players have converted a three West they shooting as I said seven for eight from three theyre shooting one for five from two but they have done a great job moving the ball getting inside drawing the defense and the interesting thing Wes they have eight total field goals they have eight assists heres the numbers were talking about look at that eight assists on eight made goals you know its interesting we were talking about the success Brad Brown Ls had Dan really in the last what six to seven years with Clemson today it was almost like if you if you thought youd kind of had that good year you might take your foot a little half step off gas there was no doing that in the Clemson locker room before the game well its funny they were talking about how they were upset that they had to week off when they were playing so well but they have come out here and theyve shot the three very well early run down by Harris five to shoot both Chase Hunter back in the game with three guards Zachary and Dylan Hunter look at this long three from cross my Heavens not much you can do about that Brad Brown out just shakes his head over there his team played ously on the defensive end lets see if that gets the Mustangs going a little bit here trailing six after Matt crosses three from practically Brad brownells lap heres Zachary back for Dylan Hunter a three to answer to strong and George the rebound for SMU and thats funny Dylan Hunter has now missed two from out there West and he has shot the ball very well from threepoint range over the last couple of games brout here at Moody Coliseum looking to really dive in on a Mustang run if they can get a bucket here halfway home and half one Harris measures Chase hunter gets Baseline had it blocked from behind and now recovered by Foster Hunter is a very very good Defender yep Foster thought about it he did think about it didnt he yeah and then he remembered he was four for six this year behind the line Zachary another one Jaden Zachary has got a dozen on four threes Clemson now has thrown in eight threes and 10 tries they average nine a game and Zachary again coming into the game shoots less than 30 from threepoint range in ACC play cross bailing it hes got eight Zachary has just tied his career high for threes in a game by the way with the fourth a moment AG go heres Wiggins now to Dylan Hunter returns it to Wiggins around culber lost it had it punched away turned over by the Tigers heres Harris leading the SMU break lob for Colbert inside and one on the Wiggins foul jel cobbert Off the Bench for Andy infield wiggin will commit the foul his first and the second on the Tigers this is an SMU team Wes that when you allow them to get out and go they are really good and this is a situation where Wiggins not only loses the ball but he nonchalant and shalant going back up the court and cobbert just runs right in front of him that is not going to make Brad Brown L very happy so Jerel cobbert whos averaging about 8 minutes a game off Andy enfields bench in conference play to the line where hes a 69 free throw shooter first free throws of the day for the Mustangs and cobbert missed the chance at the threepoint trip you know in the last three games Wiggins has played very well coming off the bench for the Tigers but a very slow start for him today heres Hunter using a lock and Screen tried to bounce it back to Victor and they end up turning it over and a foul going to be called and that is the second un loocking and thats one that Clemson can ill afford and that was a that was not a very good pass by Chase Hunter hes trying to squeeze it in someplace where theres very little room throwing it down at the ankles of loing and we just talked about how what a slow start chony Wiggins has had coming off the bench hes probably going to have to go the rest of the half as Wiggins because lockin in foul trouble yep and the Tigers come to the game today without the services of 7ot Christian Reeves sophore from Charlotte who transferred from duke is missing todays game with an ankle and theres a foul on Wiggins thats going to be his second as youa toou went to work Wes we were just talking about that a little bit before yigu went out of the game earlier that he is matched up against Wiggins and Wiggins just cant handle him in there yep so now that brings miles Foster back in and theres Wiggins sitting on the bench so is lockin and now so is Wiggins remember you get tos over 7 ft tall and Foster 6 7 yeah theres a kick out three a quendo haded spin out but he stepped out of bounds Pat Driscoll right there on the far sideline so it will go back to the Tigers who lead by four and suddenly for the Clemson inside game Ian shefflin becomes much more Applause important heres Jake Hy breeder with the quendo waiting on him and then the ball got thrown away turned over and theres a foul on Foster with George coming back up the floor so foster his first five now very quick fouls on the Tigers and a break in the ation SMU trying to capture the momentum Matt cross throwing in deep threes here for the Music Mustangs three in this first half back to Dallas in a moment Music parp Music round Music and so this would in the NCA tournament so this would be a big win for them as well yep out of the timeout 7 and a half to play its a fourpoint Clemson lead yigu kick out for George whos been terrific in the last three games and a runner with the right hand is good for junior AJ George thats a nice job by igu to kick that one out the defense is trying trying to collapse on him and he found the open man 70 run by the lanks high breeder picked up on his dribble heres Zachary with 15 to shoot Zachary all the way down and now back for hyri to quickly to Foster now is shein with yigu there Ian into traffic lost it on the balance and a Hil ball is going to go to SMU again West Clemson gets the ball close to the basket and that time they brought some help for yigu but the Tiger have just not been able to score close to the Applause goal crowd here at Moody now seeing if the Mustangs can chip away again Harris three ball got it its a 10 nothing Run for the Mustangs Chuck Harris has got nine on three triples won its not a coincidence that its Victor lockin being on the bench in foul trouble that has helped create this situation for the Mustang and that ball was almost stolen its another 100 run by the way in ACC play thats now 10 games in the 16 theyve played in ACC play that SMU has had a 10 nothing run Dan theyre 81 in the previous nine when they have a 10 nothing run in conference play its their defense that has really keyed this they didnt get discouraged with cson making all those threes early heres Hunter with 10 to shoot Zachary already a career high tying four threes in this first half heres shefin out front three over cross good rattles in for the chef boy thats a big shot this Clemson offense West is heavily reliant on the midrange game but they cant get into the midrange because the SMU defense has been so good at keeping them Music outside accredited Harris with three threes he actually only has two threes so its eight first half points for Harris inside Edwards bounc it in traffic George recovers now yigu and a foul on Foster will be his second thatll be six now on Music Clemson and this is one where the shot clock is running down chlin really has no choice cross needs to get out there and attack him with that little time left on the shot clock and Chanty Wiggins is going to get in the ball game and I think hes coming for foster no hes not so no substitution so here comes Keon Ambrose Hilton into the SMU lineup Brad Brownell hes got foul trouble all over the place Wiggins has two locking two foster now too and with his big guys hes got foul trouble yep Edwards for Harris into traffic Runner with the right hand you getu tapped it a second time Ambrose Hilton slapped at it s cant finish a fourth time heres George he had it knocked away Dylan Hunters got it tried to save it on the floor hell ball belongs to Clemson and all of a sudden we got some extra extra pulling and tugging and Pat Driscoll had to go to all fours Roger s is down there as well now obviously this is a very important game for both teams and again Clemson has had a problem with on its defensive boards SMU getting a lot of Second Chances third chances four chances thats what you have to do if youre Dylan Hunter just get down there on the floor and grab the ball yeah Dylan Hunter and CET yigu seem to be the two guys that both wanted the orange well and Dylan Hunter its much better if youre going after youa when your boat down on the ground you wouldnt want to be trying to handle him when youre standing Music up has done an outstanding defensive job against Chase Hunter yep heres AJ George trying to pick him up Hunter thought about it now shefin with 13 to shoot skips it into the corner quickly left wing Dylan Hunter fakes the three hell drive in traffic and miss the floater got his own rebound he and Ambrose Hilton did another hell ball will go to the Mustangs here now that was not a very good pass to Dylan Hunter if hes able to catch that ball cleanly West he has enough time to get the shot off but because it was a bad pass and he had to go down to his ankles to get it that gave yigu a chance to run at him so AJ George terrific appearance in sequence here in the first half Kio aqu quindo has come back now to join Edwards Chuck Harris Keon Ambrose Hilton and C yigi Harris Shoots for the tie and back through the rebound heres sheelin picked up on the transition chance look at this skip into the corner for foster hell back down on Edwards yigu helping Foster got to get rid of it in trouble slips it for Dylan Hunter Chase Hunter a three from the front is Off the Mark and run down by BJ Applause Edwards threepoint lead again for the Music Tigers a Music quendo Hilton right hand score on Ambrose Hiltons first pass theres nothing Foster can do W hes got to be very careful in there and Clemson going to take a timeout SMU who Trail by as many as nine in the first half Trails by one the Tigers havent scored in the last 2 minutes minut when we come back to Dallas tough loss at North Carolina State earlier so the deacons have lost does that make it bigger for SMU now KN when they lost the game with the deacons I I dont know that it makes it any bigger for SMU this is a great opportunity for the Mustangs and they have played very well so far yep and turned it up from behind the line Chase Hunter and Clemson have already been there four to shoot heres Dylan Hunter got a new with two one drive blocked by Ambrose Hill foul on aindo before that Caro aqu quendo start his college career in Georgia played 65 games for the Bulldogs and then spent last year in Oregon and hes come halfway back across the country to play his senior campaign second foul on SMU first on a quindo and two free throws for Dylan Hunter whos not particularly strong at the line and rattles out hes a 59 free throw shootter dont forget coming up game three of our triple header tonight well send you to Miami Jay alter and Michael Carter Williams have the tough assignment of being in Coral Gables today sure the weathers lovely and the hokes and the canes follow us here tonight from the hilltop onepoint lead for Clemson and West so far in this game game Clemsons obviously shooting the the three very well but they have exactly two points in the paint they cant get it inside yatu for the lead and Dylan Hunter the rebound Hawaii 315 to go in the first half here goes Zachary pull up two back R Miss knocked out by shefin Hunter thr about it hell drive back and Zachary to work again hes got a match up he might be able to win against Ambrose Hill Foster with the screen you getu helps Zachary all the way through five to shoot Chase hunter from the S front rim Applause Miss SMU looks for the lead again smus ability to keep hunson out of the lane has really discombobulated the Tigers often yep Edwards on the drive got the roll Mustangs in front on the second field goal for BJ Edwards from Knoxville Tennessee well you get the idea that the tigers are just trying to survive until halftime to get locken and Wiggins back in the game onepoint lead Hunter will pull up two got it that is a tough tough shot yep and that is the first basket for Clemson in this game that has not been assisted just a oneonone play yep back in front go Clemson five first half points for Chase Hunter got to go back to yigi there he is against Foster whos got two foul Zachary trying to help Edwards launching back rim miss shein the rebound Dan you said it earlier in the half Ian sheins presence going to be critical here the rest of absolutely particularly Rebound in the basketball heres Hunter fighting into traffic hell feed Foster who scores miles Fosters got four in the first half and Andy infield wants a timeout hes not happy at all with the way the Mustangs handled the dribble penetration well return to Dallas in a Music b chance in the offensive end and that has been a problem and the other thing that Clemson didnt do particularly in regulation time shoot the ball very well from Two and they have not shot the ball well from two so far in this first half heres Edwards Tigers back by three after the Foster basket that got us to the timeout they need to throw the ball to yigu theres yigu lost it on the dribble and Pat Driscoll I think a foul here on Chase Hunter its his first its the seventh on Clemson with 114 to go so thats a one and one for samat Yu Chase Hunter playing in his 160th career game today for the Tigers now Foster is doing the best he can but hes hes got totally wrapped up there and Chase Hunter just pushes his body into yig if he stops and doesnt make contact then thats not a foul soat is a 59 free throw Applause shoo and its no good f the on hand rebound from in front of AJ George AJ George had him by the other hand and so he was forced to get that onehanded rebound Chase Hunter out front for Dylan left corner zachar he got another one he does a careerhigh five threes for Jaden Zachary in the first half back to a sixpoint Advantage for Clemson cross quickly to the foul line Edwards trying to to size up shefin on the drive right hand score boy what a tough shot in bucket for BJ Edwards and I thought shefflin did everything he could do but theres that was just a great offensive Applause play hter a younger brother Dylan skipped to the corner Foster a left3 missed everything fourpoint game 15 seconds left Mustangs going to hold for the last shot out front near the timeline heres Music Harris Foster switches Harris thought about it George will push up a three no Clemson is going to take a fourpoint lead to the locker room at 3632 TI four to go in ACC play and Victor lockin back in the game lets see if he can stay out of foul trouble he picked up two fouls very early Hunter for locking on the Baseline right back for Chase Hunter thought about the three drives pull up two is good and Chase Hunter he passed up a couple of those in the first half Wes and I really think thats the best part of his game oh thats over and back wow unforced error on Chuck Harris in the Applause Mustangs but theyre running at him because theyre worried about the threes and lockin doesnt get there in time but that I think thats the best part of Chase Hunters game and Wes that was just a very simple mistake right there I dont know why Harris went into the back for to get that ball sixpoint lead for Clemson in the ball and foul off the ball Pat Driscoll the whistle who he get C yigao thatll be his first the first of the half on SMU and anytime theres a whistle blown anywhere close to locking you know Brad brownells got to be holding his breath over there sure is remember Christian Reeves not playing today ankle injury out for the Tigers theres Dylan Hunter shefin now Chase 10 to shoot or lockin picked up on the dribble quick now five to shoot back to Dylan Hunter yigu chases him heres Jaden Zachary Runner with the shot clock winding down locking the rebound right back out Chase Hunter standing three at the left that is great passing by Clemson and Andy infield wants an immediate timeout the offensive rebound was a trouble spot the three is a killer and its a ninepoint Clemson lead tigers have hit five in a row to start the frame on the Mustangs Music he second Music off e well as we went to break on the hunter three the crowd during the timeout started booing a replay on the video board Dan and heres why well because as you look up in the upper right hand corner of your screen that ball is still in Jaden Zacharys hand when the shot clock goes off thats unbelievable ably close but it appears from that slow motion replay which of course the officials dont have access to while the game is going on right it appears that that was a shot clock violation and the Tigers have scored five straight to start the second half all off the hand of Dylan Hunter and push the fourpoint lead to nine here early in the frame on the Music Mustang a quindo baseline back for cross five to shoot for Matt cross and deflected by Zachary now heres cross a fallway three is short and Zachary will clean up the long rebound remember smus playing without booy Miller for a third straight game today the foot injury keeps him on the bench for Andy infield there goes Zachary on the drave blocked by quindo recovered and scored by lockin and already we see the impact that lockin can have on this Clemson offense an offensive rebound that leads to a three and now an offensive rebound and a basset seven nothing run that ball got deflected last Touch by the Tigers Roger SS wants to yep he checked with Tony chza Jas Hunter got his hand on the ball and awards it to the Mustangs 19 to shoot for SMU you know Clemson started the game real quickly Wes and theyve started the second half real quickly and Roger checking there with President Bush to see if uh he made the right call I was getting ready to see if the 43rd President of the United States something to Roger before he put it back in play I dont think he said anything to Roger Roger initiated that whole sequence yeah this Lara of course is an snu grad therefore the former president is here for the uh second straight weekend by the way watching the Mustangs play Dylan Hunter quick look for Sheffer working against yatu and a whistle and foul is that on samat yig for the lean it is thatll be his second and the second on the mus nice Mar quindo driving the ball into the lane and that is a great job by Zachary to strip it out of there but then aindo he gets it again and loses it and he gets his ankle caught in there I hope hes okay walking in igu last Touch by S it will stay with the tigers with 15 to shoot youve been talking you were talking before the game Locks ability to draw yigao away from the basket could be a factor now that hes able to stay on the floor if he can stay on the floor Wes youre absolutely right 11 to shoot for zacher bounce pass inside heres Lockett six to shoot with yigu defending Victor winding down now back with the right hand had it blocked got it back threw it up draws the foul thats going to be the third on yigu S yigu draws his third partisans here in University part dont like it well this is just oneonone power basketball here nobody comes to help yigu and he gets the block shot now lockin able to recover that because it is a shot so he didnt thats not a traveling violation hes able to recover his shot hes able to rebound his own shot Victor lockin first free throw of the day 70 on the year and the first one bounces in hes now got six in the game quick reminder to you gymnastics on acc Network and the ESPN app returns tomorrow afternoon number 16 Stanford is at Clemson Little John colesy in the site for the Stanford Clemson duel coverage begins at 400 Eastern Wes and SMU has yet to score in this half thats right lock and hit them both that is seven now for Victor Lockett and almost anothering back Harris scoped it up right before it got to the timeline three minutes gone here second half tigers have run off nine in a row their defense has been outstanding largest lead of the day for Brad brownells team and theres a foul its going to be on Dylan Hunter thatll be Dylan Hunters first thatll be the first on Clemson of the second half Clemsons defense in this half in particular has been right up on the ball and it makes it very difficult for SMU to move the ball from side to side with the pass theyre forcing the Mustangs to be dribblers yep Harris 11 to shoot for Chuck Harris against lockin now heres Edwards out front with Dylan Hunter and a foul on saary because Chuck Harris or no Jerel cobbert is that cber under the basket and how Jaden Zachary got cover under the basket well get a look here watch this battle wow this has been a mismatch thats going on for a couple of times now and Zachary he just lost his patience in there grabbing him one way then the other and finally CRA went down first on Zachary second on Clemson in the half 15 to shoot for Edward three over Chase Hunter is good terrific shot by BJ Edwards Hes got nine first points of the half for SMU and theres a bump and a foul on cobbert Jerell Colberts first its the fourth on the Mustangs and again locking in the center of things he is you know hes pretty pretty mobile and so if you run out on him like that he can drive it by you Dylan Hunter going to go out of the game no lockin going to check out I think yep Fosters coming back in loans going out here comes Dell Jones too you know why Brad Brownell knows he gets a dead ball under 16 here too Dan right well and hes locking has been very active and so hes getting him out again to give him a little bit of rest to try to prevent that third him getting that third personal foul and here comes Johan trayor who did not play in the first half he played 12 second half minutes the other night at Notre named Dan after missing most of the last four games with a hip injury I thought he was terrific against the iris there goes shein to work he scores he and chevelin now getting it cranked up hes got eight first points of the half and Matt cross needs a timeout Zachary had loomed in the back court and was defending Edwards and cross has to burn a timeout well take one as well Clemson by 12 when we Music continue 100 hell have all that from South Beach and more to Coral Gables on Tuesday night on ESPN and of course available on the ESPN app Sports Center during the day by the there you go yeah they want to get out they want to get out of Bristol foul is on Dell Jones off the ball weathers a little better a little further south yeah thats why weve got uh mrs alter and Carter Williams standing by to bring us the canes and the hokes tonight at 6 o00 follows our coverage here in Dallas Clemson by 12 the foul off the ball on Dell Jones The Freshman from Landover Maryland his first Hons defense has been outstanding at the start of this second heres cross on the drive thats going to be a foul on shefflin First on Ian shefflin four on Clemson so the team fouls are even now with just under 16 to play but again thats what SMU has been able to do is drive and draw fouls theyre still having a tough time passing the ball from side to side in the corner heres Chuck Harris Zachary such a pest defensive Baseline goes George and a foul I believe on Foster and Miles Foster draws his third thats the fifth on Clemson hes the first tiger with three and were going to get a couple free throws here for AJ George the transfer from Long Beach State out of Fresno California when George hes a guy you know he hadnt played very much West but hes last three games its picked up yes but absolutely all year long hes had the reputation you know he can slash he can get into the lane hes a defensive pest out there we just talked about Zachary y but with more minutes George has really shown what he can do and Andy Enfield told us all year its just that he was stuck behind a couple of guys that he really likes the ability of George if theres a silver lining in the Miller injury at this particular juncture of the season its allowed AJ George to get some really big minutes heres the 221 press employed by the mus things locking against cross now back to chase Hunter against BJ Edwards well this is a change your pace trying to see how Clemson reacts in the corner Zachary a three thats his first Miss from out there today backside rebound Here Comes SMU trailing 10 now cross lost it on the dribble Zachary the turnover Jadens got two guys to beat into traffic flip up and in first regular field goal for Jaden Zacharys got 17 Wes I dont know that you can call that a regular field goal well twopoint field goal yes but that was rather an extraordinary field goal heres Harris for cross three ball and locken tried to keep it alive itll stay with SMU another look at the regular field goal and this is a really nice job by Edwards making that a very very tough shot by the way Matt cross going to the bench turned 24 years of age yesterday thats an older player in college basketball right its ironic because yesterday PJ Hall the Clemson great turned 23 just thats where we are folks games gotten old quick hadnt it Dan well we dont people like me dont talk about old I know you dont Harris lost it on the dribble heres Wiggins for Dell Jones through traffic he got swatted out of bounds and off of Jones what a play by Ambrose Hilton who never gave up on it after the ball was turned over and that was a play where maybe Jones needs to dump that one off hes trying to make another really tough basket here Wiggins is right behind him and not only does he get the shot block but he falls on the ground the ball bounces on him while hes out of bounds so SMU the ball back Chase Hunter goes out Dylan Hunters return so has C eatu playing with three fouls all here in the second half for Music SMU Edwards Yu the catch and dun second field goal for the big fell from Miss St well lock in went too far out trying to defend that screen and couldnt get back 5 and A2 gone second half 10point lead for the Tigers Dylan Hunter a slash back for lock three left of the circle and slapped around finally recovered Edwards SMU really wants to see if they can get the transition game going you get toos pass deflected Hunter the takeaway now Wiggins a three in transition and a foul will be called on Clemson I think Jones or Zachary well yig to is a little upset right now Wes and hes got to stop yelling at the officials just go out there play you know Clemson has done a nice job swarming him when hes got the ball on the inside for the most part you just have to be strong with the basketball you cannot be looking for a whistle yep and the Tigers going to offer a little bit of backboard pressure here Ambrose Hilton will fire it up the floor and heres AJ George trying to beat Zachary on the dribble oh and it got knocked off of George by Dylan Hunter the Clemson Defenders have had such active hands here in the second half theyre really generating turnovers you know Clemsons threepoint shooting has cooled off and you would expect that it would but again that double team right there thats Dylan Hunter knocking the ball away ss got five second half Music turnovers tiger lead is still 10 its been a while since anybody score Chase Hunter a three rebound for Edwards hell lead the Mustang chance a quendo on the drive rolled off the iron and it got batted away and a foul going to be called here Tony chazza off the Baseline and its on yigu thats his fourth he clearly pushed Wes and again you know when youre going to push like that you cant be yelling at the officials before such a play occurs 1338 to go fifth foul on SMU lockin gets in good position and he just pushes him out of the way and shefin will get back into the Clemson line up for lockin yigu goes to the bench so Jerel Colbert and Keon Ambrose Hilton who are 610 and 69 respectively will be the front line for Andy infield here with 133 half to play for the time being remember crosses over on the bench too and theres a whistle and a foul on the MUSC STS and its on Chuck Harris itll be the second on Harris and its six already on SMU six as well for Clemson here in the second half these guys are really banging against one another here in the second half theres an awful lot of contact going on this games quickly moved to March hasnt it well were close to March Music yep tend to shoot heres Chase Hunter thought about it bounces for shefin now Dylan Hunter hes going to have to launch fires on a quindo back rim Miss shefin to rebound ripped it away in traffic and a hell ball will go to snu whens the last time anybody score uh the scoring drought is 219 for Clemson and smus had four turnovers in the last 249 hows that okay all right so another of offense is what youre saying a lot of third and short Music conversions out of the corner quendo cber had a shot at it shefflin saved it Zachary the deflection and here goes Jaden Zachary with one guy to beat on the layup and a foul will be called and its free throws for Zachary Wes that was some kind of rebound by Ian sheff sure was and the foul on BJ Edwards will be his first so one and one for Clemson with 12 12 41 to go in the game he grabs the ball hes fou flying out of bounds and yet hes able to get an outlet pass that starts the fast break and the accs active leader in Steels came into the ball game with 218 Dan in his Atlantic Coast Conference career Zachary free throw good here comes cross for Colbert and the Mustang SMU getting a little bit smaller now cross cross is an outstanding rebounder so they dont really lose very much in terms of size Zacharys now got 19 and hell check out of the line up well not only did he make those threes I think hes been the key guy in this Clemson second half defense Jak KY Breer back into the line of he played only two minutes in the first half first time weve seen him here in half two wheres jersey number three for the Tigers heres Chuck Harris with 15 to shoot a step away three bouns off cross the rebound right back for Ambrose Hilton and the easy dunk thats what cross does he goes and he finds the rebound he just doesnt get rebounds that come to him he goes and he gets them that cross turned into a fine college player H he Dan oh absolutely hot breeder picking up heres she left wide open now Wiggins went for the dunk he got the rub in and the foul how about johy Wiggins he got the fortuitous roll and it looked like Ambrose Hilton was going to post a block shot here but this is some pass by She and youre absolutely right thats really fortunate that that ball goes in the basket but cross he goes and gets the rebound and then nobodys down covering up and Ambrose Hilton able to get an easy one couple of nice passes by big guys right there chy Wiggins who sat a good bit of the first half after coming off the bench with foul trouble first basket of the game and he adds the free throw Wiggins coming off the bench can be an extremely Valuable Player for Clemson as they go down the stretch not only in this game but of the Season Edwards on the drive leans in with a left hand couldnt get the roll and Dylan Hunter runs down the rebound hell bounce it for Chase thought about the three into traffic spot up jumper rolls in for Chase Hunter seven and the half dozen in the ball game for the senior from Westlake High School in Atlanta cross back the other way in a hurry for SMU forced it up and score double figures for Matt cross 10th straight game well somebody took the lid off the basket West because now we suddenly have some offense going on still a 13point tiger lead Hunter held up on the bounce pass for shein against Harris boy Chuck Harris terrific Defender and gets the steal there too much dribbling lead for Ambrose Hilton he couldnt handle it goes over the end line out of bounds and back to the Tigers itll go but first a timeout N9 minutes gone practically second half Clemson in front field goals in the first half and theyve already made Seven here in the second half Yep this is a Clemson team I mean their guards are experienced theyre really good defensively Ian shefflin gives you a such a great deal on the inside shefin on the perimeter heres lockin High breeder is out there now instead of Dylan Hunter thats the only change in the lineup in terms of the starter being on the bench tend to shoot for Chase Hunter bounce pass lock in the catch and the dunk what a pass by Hunter what a pass by Hunter but what a catch by loan on the move how valuable has locking been to this offense in the second half tiger lead is 15 with 10 and a half to Music play Harris now cross boy theyre going to need Matt cross to wire it up theres a lob inside they got deflected by sheflin on the way to Ambrose Hilton here you go Dan well shefflin hes just cuts to the basket and Ambrose Hilton thought he was going to set a screen and he didnt do it he just went right to the goal and thats a tough angle to make a pass but Chase Hunter one of the great assist guys all time in Clemson history heres AJ George hes playing with Chuck Harris BJ Edwards Ambrose Hilton and Matt cross and that got knocked Away by Zachary they roll to the deck again Harris or Edwards came up with it Harris rather did and the shot clock went off shot clock violations again the quick hands of the Clemson guards and who is down there on the floor making the shot clock run out but Ian cheffer 14th turnover for SMU Dan we know Duke is the Premier defensive unit in the ACC I think weve all seen that I agree okay Clemsons not far behind it feels like you know Clemson you you mentioned before Clemsons numbers in the ACC now this is overall but Im talking about in conference play theyre number two in opponents points per game and thats really the the only stat that means anything these other numbers are nice but the only thing that means anything is the points Chase Hunter buries a deep three hes now got 15 in the ball game 10 here in the second half including two threes hes got three in the contest cross on the drive n and 1 half to play and two turned it over thats number 15 now on the musts well they just lost him and if youre going to lose a guy out on the courner for Clemson it shouldnt be Chase Hunter y but every time the SMU big guys get the ball and try to back to the basket the Clemson guards are dropping down and snapping at it and its just really hard to get any offensive flow 920 to play heres a quick look inside locking the catch had it knocked away itll stay with the Tigers it was uh Edwards and cross that collapsed on Victor locket I dont think lockin realized how open he was West you catch that ball you shoot a little hook shot U so CET yigu went to the bench with 1338 to play and 4 minutes and 20 seconds later here he is with four fouls W theres no reason to save him youre behind by 18 points doesnt really help you if he doesnt fall out of the game but you lose by 20 Zachary the runner wouldnt go Clemson got their own rebound Oh I thought he was going to shoot that Zachary will and miss it lock it knocked it out third try for the Tigers well Zachary used up all his threepoint shooting in the first half maybe for the remainder of the month well the month doesnt have long to go thats a good thing for him high breeder theres a step three to the left itll Miss and they Scramble for it last touch tryo itll stay with the Tigers Clemsons going to get a is this a fifth chance yes and its a chance thats created by the hustle of Ian sheflin he just never gives up on a ball yep Music High breeder now for Zachary shot clock reset to 20 now locking ready over yigu rimmed out of three cross the rebound on one those missed threes SMU really has to push the ball cross on the drive and a foul on Chase Hunter I think for the reach itll be his second that is the seventh now on Clemson late 27th play so settle in here on the common fouls for free throws and Matt cross whos 71 is going to be the first customer when Chase Hunter had himself in good position with the body but he couldnt resist reaching in Cross now with 11 on the free throw you see Chase Hunter will come out Dylan Hunter back in theres Evansville Indiana native Brad Brownell with the oldfashioned box outside its old fashioned but its still a good sign y still know what it means right yep 16point lead for the Tigers cross hit them both well his team surrendered 10 offensive rebounds in the first half only two so far in this half Zachary little pocket pass lock and turned on yigu back now the fallway will bounce in for Victor Lockett 8 and 12 11 in the game transfer from Cincinnati clearly igu has to be very very careful in there yep Harris thought about the spot up three BJ Edwards cant find the Baseline yigu the catch and hell get the easy bucket six for yigu and Wes that term you just use Easy bucket is something SMU hasnt seen very many of in this half yep Clemsons got 20 assists and theres a foul on Harris and that is a season high for the Tigers free throws when we come back to Dallas tigers by six wake thats a tremendous rivalry theyre playing at NC State and the decks just couldnt get it done today Dylan Hunter over for two at the line hit the front end of the one and one first point for Hunter who had 17 at Florida State last Saturday as averaged 10 over his last three and those last three all starts yep he is 2 years and 8 Days younger than chase by the way Wes I think his speed Dylan Hunter speed that is really enhances this Clemson defense and there he gets his hand on the ball again well thats where hes aditt the long arm reaches right in flicks out heres yigu now playing with the four fouls hell score on the jump hook 6 and the half in the game for samat gigo and thats a very positive sign for SMU but now they got to get stops down on the other Applause end coming up on seven minutes to play its a 16point Clemson Music lead you told hes got to be very careful out here you dont want to pick up a silly foul theres Zachary in the left corner firing for another one spun out on him Edwards a rebound Jason Zachary hit five first half threes Yu fouled on the play by lockin no its shein shein reached in Wes thats what weve been talking about the entire game the SMU guys playing with their back to the basket they start to turn and somebody from Clemson drops down and starts swiping at the basketball so two free throws for samat yigu who came over to the United States is listed interesting one of the preseason notes called him a developmental play player my goodness Ill tell you this if hes developmental wow hes developing very well absolutely hes averaging 11 points six rebounds in ACC play I think hes probably got a spot locked up on the all rookie team Dan I I think thats pretty good guess Wes get two Blue Devils on there youre going to get probably I and Jackson of North Carolina so Yu is probably going to be there all of a sudden youre running out of name youre getting in trouble you only got one boat left you get 18 teams youre going to run out of names pretty quickly sure are dont forget uh heres Zachary on the drive kick out front shein a three back rim Miss and Ambrose Hilton pulled it away so now its a 14point game with 6 minutes left little sign of life here yep and turned over 16 of them now for the Mustangs Chase Hunter thought about the pull up you know he was right in front of Brad Brown out Brad may have blocked it if he tried to shoot that one good point heres Zachary working through traffic he lost it on the dribble out of bounds it will go to Clemson no foul called I think Jaden thought he got one but did not well you know its very interesting Zachary is on the drive here and he loses his balance and not because anybody hit him because he stepped on the foot of Chuck Music Harris Edwards wob inside youu left it on the rim Andy infield turns and looks into the sky here at Ludy Coliseum get your seven footer a twoot shot you generally think thats going in yep heres Zachary back for lock and hell off to three and hit Victor locking second three of the day hes now got 14 in the contest remember West he only had three in the first half because he was in foul trouble Edwards had it blocked gets it back with just ahead of five minutes to go tiger lead is 17 Harris fouled and Dylan Hunter will catch his second foul and the ninth on Clemson this is what Clemson did so well in the first half U gets way too far away from lockin and lockin just has all day to shoot that thing and Chuck Harris going to go to the line to shoot a pair here he is an 84 free throw shooter does not have enough attempts and conversions to qualify for the ACC statistical run but the free throw is good nine for Harris dont forget tonight following Virginia Tech Miami about 800 Eastern to so the nothing but net crew breaks down the full day and in the ACC highlights an analysis with Taylor tanon bomb Luke hanock Joel Barry the third Carlos Boozer Wes weve been talking about the great defensive work being done out here today by the Clemson guards and I think you have to add to that the fact that B Miller isnt playing sure you know one of the top guards in the ACC plays for SMU hes not in the game today hes got that bruised foot and thats not trying to make an excuse for SMU that is a fact y that hes not able ble to play and that really hurts Hunter went for the reverse and Wiggins kept it alive and then they tried to make the save and over the end line out of bounds and theres a look at Kevin Miller of Chicago Illinois better known as bopy to everybody leads SMU in scoring an assist in fact hes fourth in the ACC an assist he is seventh in steals when youd really like to have a guy like that against this be Clemson defensive back look out of the corner Ambrose cant hit it rebounded Edwards back up and rejected by Wiggins four and a half to go Edwards from the left wing of three BJ Edwards now with 12 in a game and thats something we saw from SMU in the first half the ability to get offensive rebounds and conversion 12point game now with 420 to go Applause sheflin now Zachary Works Baseline all the way through Wiggins off the Baseline knocks down the jumper second field goal Chanty Wiggins with five all in the second half over 14point tiger Lee cross with Chase Hunter defending Ambrose Hilton voids Chase Hunter and Scoops it in nicely done by the senior from Toronto transferred from Alabama back to a 12point game and three and a half to play next foul by either School Dan is 10 so two shots on every common foul Dylan Hunter against AJ George got to shein screen in the corner Wiggins a three got it chony Wiggins and a timeout taken by Clemson Wiggins has eight and I mean I think in the second half Clemsons defense really ramped it Music up heres Edwards out front cross and back rim missed Zachary the rebound you too took a spill he is slow to his feet hes got to get up and get going there we go see and Clemson will gladly take that yes just to fine get cement taken care of its a left shoulder that hes kind of rewinding there theres a bunch of guys got tangled up in there I was Im kind of sitting here going through some math during the break and thats dangerous as you know very dangerous um as long as I dont have to do it SMU has a road trip to Kin Stanford Syracuse at home and at Florida State to finish Dan if this holds theyre still going to be tied with W forest and lose the head tohead by the way on that 45 the last spot in the double bu still in the balance with you know couple weeks to go heres Chase Hunter five to shoot and a foul Music called and free throws coming for Clemson on Ambrose Hiltons foul theres a look at Cal there are the Nets with them so youre not going to gain a lot of ground thats 10 by the way on the Mustang no youre not going to gain a lot of ground in terms of an at large bid for the NCA tournament but you do have an opportunity to gain ground in the race for the the fourth double BX that is correct remember Wake Forest has a game remaining at Duke yep Hunter at the line first one good well hes had some second half yep five in the first half these are his first free throws of the day so hes got 11 here in the second and he knocks the second one now Chase Hunter was 17 Zacharys got 19 lockin got 14 and the Tigers have 75 as a team and there goes Edwards and that got raped out by Dylan Hunter who looks at Pat Drisco H to say man come on thats three and the half 10 on Clemson Dylan Hunter all three fouls here in the second half W an Ian shefflin you know we havent talked about him much but he has eight points hes got five rebounds hes got three assists hes got a couple of steals and Ambrose Hilton makes the free throw hes 15 of 25 at the line this year hes got five in the half and seven in the ball now this is a tough place to Comm in and play and this Clemson team has even with foul trouble in the first half was you know theyve done everything they needed to do they relied on the three in the first half with locking in the game in the second half its been more defense and twopoint shooting but this is a complete looking Clemson Team D theyre going to get to 14 League wins and if this holds this is going to be six straight road WIS in the ACC that is strong Music now their only Road loss so far is Lille six to shoot two minutes to play here goes shefin kept it on the dribble strong to the basket and scores 10 for Ian shefin now just nothing seems to bother him heres Ambrose Hilton a three its good and a timeout for Andy infield with 148 to play so 14 point is the tiger lead 7763 we continue in a moment day yep tell you the thing that catches your eye too is a lot of the foundation of that team that went to the Elite 8 last year in 24 wins feels like is helping comprise this particular team that is going to reach 22 wins they can hold on the next 148 inbounds to shefflin and heres Chase Hunter the catch and hell flip it ahead locking one dribble and a dunp Music get over bab 7963 90 seconds left and Chuck Harris firing away and knocked out of bounds by the combination of Dylan Hunter and Jaden Zachary Hunter does a nice job getting it in bounds and heres Ian shefflin he gets out of a triple team gets it to Zachary and when you have a triple team in one place somebodys going to be opening another heres Harris time winding away on SMU Music and lockin going to draw the foul itll be his third couple of free throws for Harris with 12 122 to play Wes and that is a key statement you just made its loans third foul and he had two fouls in the first four minutes of the game yeah he went to the bench with his second at the 822 Mark of the first half how about that and thats his first foul of the second half question youre also talking about Clemson winning on the road the last last couple years theyve been five and five on the road this is the first time theyve had a winning record on the road in ACC play since 1986 87 oh boy 8687 now thats going back aways thats one of those Timber has to text you to tell you who how good that team was well that thats that thats that horse Grant team yeah yeah front Court heres locking hell skip it across CR for Zachary 73 seconds to play and the Tigers will just hold it out here in the midcourt Music area and Clemsons going to go to 22 and5 and 142 in the ACC and stay with Louisville and thats one full game back of Duke Wes they have been outstanding on the defensive end today but theyve also given you a picture of the kind of complete offensive team that they can be out of the corner theres Harris knocking down a three my goodness third three of the day for Harris its his first field goal to the second half hes got six in the half and 14 in the ball game and I think were going to look and see if that actually was a three so Tony chazza defers and Pat Driscoll goes to the monitor across the way here at Moody Coliseum lets see what do we got here its close but thats a three I think Music so not enough States evidence to overturn that I dont Music think and its a three yep inbounds cross stole it got it to Ambrose Hilton and heres Harris gunning for another three itll be off the rim cross the rebound Edwards looking for a three long miss ball rolled out here they go the Scramble with 25 seconds left finally Edwards heres Harris hes just going to drive the lane and lay it in Music and that makes it a 10point game and heres the inbounds to Zachary and hell bring it into front court and I think Dan thats going to do it Clemsons going to win by a final of 7969 and the Tigers were Applause impressive impressive on both ends of the Court Wes yep 10
