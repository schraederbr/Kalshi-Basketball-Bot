line at 45 pack will give it up popper dumping it down low first touch for omir and theyll swing it around heres Cleveland with a pull up pop and knocks it down nice quick start for him a great start for Matthew Cleveland to make his first field goal back after missing really two and a half games he missed the second half of the game against Notre Dame where he injured that hit hes trying to pick up their 14th win and their sixth win in ACC Play heres Couture getting it down L Baron with a nice little hook in close Robbie Baron at 69 and Robbie Barons been playing much better as of late for the hokes not only is threepoint shooting but becoming more of a force in the Applause paint kanes at 147 5 five in the ACC given where they ended last season which of course was in the final four they have had one of the more bizarre seasons of any team in division one this year they absolutely have and a lot of its had to do with their turn turnovers they get a turnover on that possession and thats really been the one thing thats hampered this Miami team at the bottom of the ACC in turnovers per game MJ Collins coming up 17 against Duke absolutely exploded hes only six points a game for the first half he couldnt miss in that game pack off the front of the iron cant connect and Obie this game is going to come down to who can get stops youre talking about two teams who have been traditionally very good defensive teams in ACC play however its been a struggle for both this year Virginia Tech starting to get things going on the defensive end of the floor Miami still struggling heres Couture way downtown cant sink that one had a whistle and an injury Wugga popler a little bit lame the 65 Junior the Philadelphia native badly hled right now and barely able to get over to his own bench and wga popper has battled with injuries throughout this season hes another one of the Hurricanes thats missed games and you see see as hes trying to chase Hunter Couture off the steps on kesan Georges foot rolls that left ankle and immediately hobbles over to the bench but its been ankle injuries thats hampered wuga popper who started ACC play is the predominant favorite for a most improved player has struggled with injury since Cleveland has that pass batted back out of play injuries have been a huge part of the story from Miami we say why have they had such a rer look at the list of guys who have missed at least one game for them theyve rarely had the chance in conference play Cory to have the same lineup they havent they havent had this practice time together so when you consider the fact that Miamis only had in their 20 now 22 games theyve only had their starting lineup in 14 of those games so a third of their games theyre not having their whole routine now Joe pack with the basket most outstanding player of the Midwest Regional last spring in the glor days for the Hurricanes when they went to the final four and they shot out of the gate very quickly this year too they were 50 they were ranked in the top 10 Baron again almost the exact same shot he made in the opening minute yeah but a great find from ly kid right there recognizing the defense coming over Robbie Baron with a great cut not just standing along the threepoint line anymore making his presence felt another ways Miami got crushed when they fac Kentucky at rup Arena that was after they had started the season 50 they were destroyed by K colado by 27 they lost to ACC bottom feeder Louisville that was right here in fact at Coral Gables they lost at the buzzer at Syracuse just lost NC State this week 74 to 68 so its been such a strange year well and this a Miami team that came in with preseason expectations of being one of the best teams in the ACC but realistically their defense has let them down and weve shown the injuries its been a lot going on but one thing that has not been a problem for the hurricanes is this guy at the free throw line NORAD oir whos having a unbelievable season almost averaging a double double once again after doing so last season making 63 of his shots overall to foul was on LY Kidd his first and heres padul again 33 points when they met the first time he was scorching hot that one batted away and the is going to keep it on the line Miami could not force the turnover and for Mike young that thats been an issue for his team this year hes the first one to admit it nobody hates turnovers more than this man does and the turnovers are up a little bit this year they are up a little bit this year however theyre down over the last two games only 11 combined turnovers in their last two games vers Georgia Tech and vers Duke theour off the fake he gets it back couldnt put it in the air under underneath po strong move and hes a strong guy as hell drop in two but also very patient in the post recognizing Defenders were going to be coming over trying to swipe the basketball the away does a great job hiding it and then finishing it off for the bucket po had a great game against Georgia Tech had 18 points the career high but Duke held him to four was Georgia Tech coming off that incredible upset thats going to roll in nice touch there by omir absolutely soft touch used every part of the rim to go in but when you got a soft touch like that you can make plays like North chadow be many guys would shoot that it would clang off the rim in the lost to NC State 18 points 14 rebounds padulla that was partially blocked and now Miami on the Run packed the point guard and he will throw that to the corner and Miami cant save it itll go back over to the hokes and well take our first time out Miami on top 86 over Virginia Tech 1555 to go in the first Virginia Tech in the nonconference as well Miami struggled in nonconference especially on the road at Kentucky and that big loss to Colorado so theyve got to make up ground in ACC play theor with a catch and shorts so Miami up by two Kane they 10 and two at home and that ones going to be flipped out of play and an Aon pass by omir looking for a cutter Ill tell you what a noon tip off in Miami is a tough task for the home fans home fans its tough task for me I was thinking about not coming in today Obie you got this all on your own my guy when I left the hotel and saw how beautiful it was was outside I just it crossed my mind thats half of it is how beautiful it is all the time 75 and Sunny theres an awful lot to do here particularly late at night as padulla is going to get hacked and all night hanging out last night you know I would you know thats not me now dont hang me with that one Im like Im more like you know its gorgeous outside lets get on the boat lets go out to the bay and enjoy life a little bit right so we reverse rolls on that one okay and then go do the game there you go but noon s tough Jim Lena the 74 yearold Bronx New York native coming off an incredible season last year in and out by padulla so he makes one of two schedule is really stiffened up from Mike Young and the hokes though that really started with the game the other night against Duke and now facing a team that protects the home floor very well a trip as Pac will hit the Music deck good to see W poppers running back to the scores table checking into the game W guy who was so clutch in their final 4 run with one of the best pullup Jumpers in division one yeah great in the midrange he hasnt been getting able to get it going offensively as much but is coming off of a double double at NC St last time out 10 points and 10 rebounds but a very important part of this Miami team which doesnt have much of a bench neither of these teams really play a lot of their bench so they get a lot of production from their starter popler to inbounds look help here and he gets it over the top to omir who cuts back inside and lays it in nor Chad omir continues to dominate in the painted area Miami had 30 points in the paint in that that lost at NC State just struggled to shoot the ball from the perimeter little bit of an uh oh early on I think here for the hokes number 15 is getting roll and thats going to be a travel on potit so a turnover for Virginia Tech lets go back to omir for a moment 18 points 10 rebounds a game well you see his ability to be able to screen and roll to the rim but more important doesnt run over MJ Collin and pick up an offensive foul that catch the presence the Poise to be able to finish it with the left hand over the rim and hes been the offense early for the Kane hes the only player in the country to average a double double the previous three years first two of those it Arkansas State heres pack hell knock that one down thats a twopointer great battle between these two guys you got Hunter Couture whos not not only a knockdown shooter but also an excellent Defender going up against Nigel Pac whos one of the most difficult guys to guard in ACC pulla catches fires thats off the side of the backboard hes coming off a very tough shooting day from threepoint land against Duke pack going around the back here again nearly lost it and the kick thatll be out of play and Miami a little bit wild Distributing the ball already with four turnovers hean George is firing that one out yeah that thats been the you know the Achilles Hill for the Hurricanes all season long turnovers have hampered them and which is shocking with such a you know great group of guards you talk Bley Joseph kesan George Nigel pack theyve got a lot of guys that are very good ball handlers just often times careless with their plays Chris Miami Losing Isaiah Wong and Jordan Miller two absolute stars from last years team and so very tough to replace heres pedulla oh lot of iron but it dropped in well one of the things that were seeing now thats the third threepoint field goal attempt for Shawn padulla but hes having to shoot over a much taller Defender kesan George getting that rle of guarding him and shooting over a GU is 68 is much more difficult and a whistle here heres padulla who has now gone over 1000 career points and this is the only one where you didnt have a strong contest George a little late on that one so padul is able to see space his first shot was way off and then the second one hit the side of the backboard so George defensively making a difference against Sha padulla but Shawn using the entire rim to be able to get one to go down well earlier in the season when Couture was out he had to put it all on his shoulders out of that back court he had 26 against fisu 32 against Clemson 33 against Miami had a tremendous threegame run and and he absolutely garnered the respect of Jim Lena and this Miami Hurricane team when he dropped those 33 so much so that they put size on him this game George will fire nice touch there from threepoint L and the Freshman George has really come a long way in the starting lineup now start of the season coming off the bench but he has been super productive in shooting the basketball extremely well 68 freshman originally from Switzerland padulla on the wing going be by five up top for ly kid at 610 and Couture trying to fight his way through will draw the foul and hell be hit by nor Chad omir picks up the personal and Cleveland coming back on the floor now for Miami its a big story today for Jim Laren at Matthew Cleveland back in The Fray the transfer from FSU works so hard to improve his threepoint shot and he comes in at 38 yeah and Matthew Cleveland of course is like a glue guy he rebounds the basketball he defends he makes all the right team plays for you to help you win games so missing him the last couple of games has been a huge factor for the canes kid trying to back his way toward the paint with that left hand thats a pretty play you saw the double team early but then joen left and Len kid recognizing theres no longer defender in the middle gets the easy left hand hook Paul joob Bay The Freshman from France getting some minutes Lately from Jim Lena heres popper on the wing wuga will let fly and swish it home from way downtown thats been the Improvement in wuga Poppers game at one point was shooting over 50 from three Midway through the season pulla going in strong among the trees and hell stick that one right back up and in that was sha padulla with the put back what are you doing there mixing it up with the big guy Sean six points offensive rebound put back padulla at 61 Bley Joseph Cleveland trying to get going got Airborne Joe Bay going in tight but cant finish it oh thats a dime oh kid couldnt handle it but that was actually an excellent feed there from padulla should have meant two points it absolutely should have been two and for the Miami Hurricanes happy this see Wier pop the back on the floor and Wier rewards the fans with a big time three off the bounce and on the other end of the floor Shawn padulla mixing it up with the Big Fellas doesnt matter to Shawn hes tough enough to finish amongst the trees to the final four now after taking Miami George Mason back in 2006 I believe as an 11 seed the first 11 seed to ever make it to the NCA final four and you know six combined wins over Duke and Carolina thatll make you a lot of fans in Coral Gables or should whistle here with 1046 to go in the half also have to mention that with Cliff Ellis retiring earlier this year Jim Lan now the longest tenure head coach in division one basketball so youre talking about a guy whos seen a lot from the sidelines and also accomplish a tremendous amount now people who cover Miami basketball say not only is he one of the smartest coaches you are ever going to meet in any sport he is always the same guy you know win or lose streaky or non streaky for the team injuries are no hes always the same guy k a great move along the Baseline to spin into yeah Len kid who leads the ACC and field goal percentage continues to be successful when he gets his opportunities on the block of course later on tonight at 630 another edition of Duke and North Carolina cant wait for that one North Carolina coming off a shocking defeat by Georgia Tech turnaround here and up and in by Nigel pack the six foot Jr gets two Nigel pack off the bounce and hes going to have to play against bigger Defenders guys who are going to try to force him to have to shoot over top of an outstretched hand but Nigel Pac has no problem seeing the rim regardless Applause whos Collins going to work with his midrange shot but thatll spin out and its Miami on top 2016 and the Music ball Cleveland looking inside here Bley Joseph shot clock down to 13 and a kick 921 left in the half well six college basketball games highlight our ESPN schedule today today three of those Sonic Blockbusters Houston and Kansas thats number four number eight coming up and of course number seven Duke taken on number three North Carolina 10th ranked Kentucky hosting number five Tennessee thats at rup Arina thats 12 and 1 half hours of college basketball you can also watch on the ESPN app from anywhere Im just happy to be a part of it this could be go go down as one of the best days in college basketball history when you consider all the matchups going on a top 10 EXC me of rank triple header on ESPN then weve got games like this on the deuce where you got two teams battling to try to build their resume a quad one win opportunity for the hokes and you and I have seen a lot of North Carolina a lot of Duke this season so I want to get your opinion on how that game is going to go down you over the last you know 10 meetings or so theres barely any separation in total points between those two I believe well one when people are shocked with the loss at Georgia Tech Im not sure why because Damon dmire and the rambling wreck as Tyler Nichols steps up and knocks down the three ball off a great action they beat Duke on the flat so Im not surprised why people are you know shocked that they beat Carolina on the FL I think its because theyre not beating very many others yeah other than those two lets not get caught up in the details popler here for pack off the fake they want NORAD again out of the double Here Comes Cleveland shot he swishes in a triple nice find from omir to Cleveland beyond the threepoint Arc Good Start From Matthew Cleveland in his first game back but you can see Mike young likes to match up with malija patite guarding NORAD oir more so than Len kid so when omir gets back into the game normally youre going to see potit on the floor is Shan padulla who earlier in this game got a th000 points for his career and Virginia Tech has that capacity to stick to everybody they they really do because they have such great shooting in padulla Hur MJ Collins steps up and makes plays like this that helps teams win how about that effort and out of Play It goes thats going to be off of Miami they say on a tip nor Chad not just a score also can help his teammates along as he drops the dime from Beyond The Arc to here on ESPN in our family of networks padulla has that one spin out but he has eight pretty quick points here in the first half Miami up by two yeah but Shan badulla having to work for all those points every shot is heavily contested by Kean George whos trying his best to keep sha padulla in check of course after you drop 33 on somebody youre going to go right to the top of the scouting report if you werent there already funny how that happens heres Clevelands short jumper and he short rimmed it dadullah always wants to push that tempo and comes free in another turnover give it right back padulla off the fake will drive and kick potit a dribble down draws the foul and hell be at the line I like Shan padulla taking that three and hes going to have a conversation right in front of us with my guy Mike young we can listen in on this one we sure can he called him over as the words were coming out of your mouth that I like Shan padoodle taking that shot its exactly what he told him absolutely I mean you get an opportunity like that for one of the best in the ACC shooting the basketball from beond threepoint Arc off of a steal and Sean was disappointed that he pretty much turned the basketball over but patite was able to get it back and when he threw it to padulla in the on that Wing you got to let that one go because shots are hard to come by for a guy like Shan padulla whos at the stop top of the shouting report so for us a little inside broadcasting right we are right in front of Mike young most of the time when Mike goes to the top of the coachs box and Im saying Im waving get out of the way Co cant see cant see we got to look around Mike all the time if we want to see not that he cares but I mean hes very polite pleasant guy though he might actually care oh hes the nicest guy in the world he probably would take a step to his left but I dont think its as important for us to see as it as for him I would agree entirely Cleveland makes a move but short again and a whistle along the Baseline yeah cuz I saw none of that that was a rumor everything that happened on that series was a rumor as were way over here were looking right through the head coach yeah and not to mention players checking in over here to our right at the scores table all the time who tend to be somewhere in the area of 65 and seven ft yes potit picked up his second foul Cleveland handing off for pack isan George gives it up shot clock down to 10 on the spin popper nothing there George taking a look shot clock to three got to get one up Applause there six minutes to go here in the first half in Miami Hunter Couture pretty quiet to this point and too long with that one so far they have shut him down yeah Hunter coutur not really able to get going offensively thus far its being a lot that energy and effort trying to keep Nigel Pac under control of course Nigel Pac who scored 23 all 23 of his points in the second half against NC State last time out I still think Hunter Couture had the best shooting game Ive ever seen in the ACC oh no question about you and I had him at Florida State and he had an incredible game where he was coming across midcourt maybe a step and launching it they all went made nine threepoint field goals two years ago at Florida State and you know what was lost in that OB sha padulla made six he made six and Shawn made five in the first half I remember that game so those guys like shooting in Florida so much to where they now hold a onepoint lead here on the road now the hokes surging in front their first lead of this contest pack going strong on Couture some contact great defense by Hunter Couture though just staying with nael pack and going vertical not picking up the foul padulla batted around controlled by Miami and pack wants to run Collins picked him up on the spin move pack gets it up there draws the foul he was determined he was either going to get fouled or make the basket hell be at the line so the foul will go against Collins who picks up his first and willll bring pack to the line where hes 78 gu is very very very smart with the ball 70 assists coming in just 35 turnovers yeah hes the one guy thats been very shorthanded for the Kings what a womens basketball triple header we have for you tomorrow on ESPN 2 in the app number 17 Virginia Tech taking on number 24 North Carolina then number one South Carolina the only unbeaten D1 team left hosting Old Miss in the SEC cap the afternoon in the Big 12 the a Pack 12 with seventh ranked UCLA in fourth rank Stanford should be a great afternoon for womens basketball Im locked in tomorrow also of course my favorite womens basketball program the Virginia Tech Hokies taken on North Carolina and then I got to say my second favorite South Carolina Gamecocks in the second game so George on the wing George stripped to the basketball and the hokes will pry it free Collins bouncing for nickel he wont wait and sticks it now you see how Tyler nickel did not hesitate he got an open look he knocks it down Shan padulla has to do the same thing Tyler Nicholls parents and I had a made the trip from uh the flight to baggage claim and then the rental car center together yesterday great talking with Eric and Jackie everybodys bags arrive as expected they did Jackie was on as she got the bags well before Eric and I we were running our miles oh right now Virginia Tech has grabbed the momentum here theyre on an 82 run Miami has missed their last seven shots heres Couture straight on he sticks a threepointer we just had to start talking about how well these guys shoot the basketball in the State of Florida for hun good tour I wonder why everyone comes to Miami OB yeah is it funny how that happens funny how they check the forecast and its February its time to get to Miami as wherever you are its probably not this nice well now Miami trying to stem the tide a little bit heres popper from the corner not there he follows his own miss good hustle to get to that first thats a round and out batted again Collins goes out for it and a good save here and the hokes have it back we talked about in our open who was going to be the team that stepped up and get the job done defensively and its been the hokes as of late theyve stifled the Hurricanes which is a difficult team to hold in check offensively L kid jumping inside cant finish it though and he hit the deck yeah Miami trying to end the streak of nine consecutive misses and instead its going to go the other way its another turnover Matthew Cleveland coming in and running directly into Hunter Couture and thats going to be another turnover for the canes now eight turnovers for Miami in this first half as part of the reason why they havent been able to get anything going offensively they continue to turn the basketball over when these two teams get together they tend to be very very close games five of the last seven have been decided by four points or less that was the case when they met back in January heres Nicholls straight on got a really good look and that was in the cylinder and kicked out on the run out turned over again heres nickel to lead the charge Collins tough pass got tangled up with it on his shoulder heres coutur to launch he hits it a three pointer dead on hunor showing off all his athleticism played all three Sports growing up used off his infielding right there OB he picked that one up out of dirt but still got into a shooting pocket to knock it down yeah his second home was Disneys Wide World of Sports with all the sports he played and thats a true story he played everything going for the dunk but he cant do it that was Nigel Pac he wanted to file no call pulla to Nickel Nickel wants the paint Thats slapped right from behind into the hands of George G and hes tied up and fouled and that foul will be on Shawn padulla now I dont like Shawn taking that foul in reason being is because we talked about the depth for Virginia Tech does that a foul that comes back to haunt you later Shan padulla of course in the way that Virginia Tech defends they need him on the floor he cant afford to put himself in foul trouble even though that is his first thats one that could come back to haunt you later know Miami right now having a tough time making a basket of any kind pack trying to end that good defense by Nicholls great job by Tyler nickel contesting that Music shot Mike young right in front of us screaming on move the ball they do to Couture round it out he wanted that one OB saw him on the way back just a little skip he felt like that one was down thats a shot he hits in his sleep typically the Virginia Tech on top 3325 popper working on Couture going around the back jumps into that paint and misfired but when you see that possession defensively by Hunter Couture now you recognize the fact that he did not play in the first game how much he was missed for Virginia Tech when you see hes taking on a number of different offensive opponents here today Niel with that lane opening up a lay it in Bo he made a smart decision there and drops in two and theyre up by 10 an 11 zip run strong first half for Tyler niichel who minutes can be spotty at times but he has stepped up big for the hes here on the road and this has been a season long problem for Jim l in Miami the inability for long stretches to make shots theyve missed 12 in a row here down the stretch of the first half at home pack again to the Lane and a foul this time time with 54 seconds to go Okies were not happy with that call at all but give Nigel pack credit for initiating the contact on that play and Nigel pack has been set on getting to the Lane we normally see him shooting more of the three but he has been intent on getting into the painted area great job defensively by Hunter Couture but you see Nigel pack jumping in now that is the right call let me tell you the reason why you see H 100 Coutures feet inside the restricted area any contact in the restrict area especially if you dont well here you go the story lines Miami missing 13 of their last 14 shots and again thats been an issue all season long for the Hurricanes an 11 nothing run for Virginia Tech in a game that as we came on the year today were describing as one neither could afford to lose and give Virginia Techs defense a lot of that credit we talked about what these guys can do offensively but defensively is where Mike young has built this program and where they hang their hat and that defense has showed up over the latter part of this first half and they have held these hurricanes in check Miami comes in averaging over 80 points per game only averaging 74 in ACC play though theyve slumped off a bit but still a dangerous offensive team time to get off a heave here for padulla he launches off the front of the iron he thought he had it too well they hit a lot of them down the stretch didnt they they absolutely did and got a great look right there in the end but Tyler niichel Hunter Couture theyve stepped it up from three Virginia up top heres kid who had 10 rebounds in the first half Couture with a kick padulla lcks one up but itll be short and another great contest by Kean George defensively on padulla theyre making things difficult for Shan padulla but fortunately for the hokes other guys have gotten involved offensively George the Freshman with a bounce feed for omir he got off to a quick start but then really slowed down hell draw the foul he was kind of a nonfactor on the offensive end the last 10 12 minutes of the second first half yeah omir got in foul trouble picked up that second foul so it wasnt as aggressive to end that first half we get opportunity to see our leading scores in this game Nigel Pac with nine and omir with six 15 of the 26 at the half for Miami so theyve only got production for really those two guys Lyn kid picking up foul number two and thatll roll in for nor Chad omir hes coming in playing as well as anybody in the ACC is lately not Miami as a team but omir individually yeah averaging 23 and 11 rebounds over his last four games played of course missed that game at Syracuse which Miami lost on a buzzer beater but hes been playing great basketball kid on omir thats its a pretty good duel getting his footing and omir just stayed home it came right to Baron though and he gets it to go another great play by Robbie Baron he started off the first half right around the basket finished off a couple of great opportunities from passes from his teammates omir way deep into the lane but cant finish it now the 11th rebound for Len kid who is doing his best nor Chad omir impression in this game pulla with a travel basketall so the hokes with their sixth turnover today leading at 3728 Mike young pleading with AJ Desi on the fact that he felt like North Shadow Mir walked on an earlier possession and then of course he sees his guy sha padulla get called for the traveling love AJ decide just listening and then walking on yes heres Cleveland to drive it strong and deny but a foul Baron with the personal as he went for the block and W up getting hit with a foul is First Matthew Cleveland trying to drive Baron the foul is not up top you see the right hand down low thats the call AJ decide right there at the angle to be able to see the right hand on the outside hip of Cleveland 78 foul shooter Matthew Cleveland formerly of Florida State the Junior from Atlanta there a question about just how much he would play today one up starting after missing the last two and a half games with a hip injury but back in there this afternoon was productive made the first field goal of the game for Miami at two and then also knocked down at three but hasnt had the same type of impact in this one that were used to seeing from Matthew Cleveland kid on the low block out of the double got it fre to Couture but way deep in the corner hell driveing kick Baron is open got it on the money with a triple the hokes have shared the basketball extremely well hund to cracking the paint and then finding Robbie Baron who missed a number of those easy threes against Duke on Monday knocks one down there tough to guard hes 69 omir going in strong thats nor Chad omir right there of tough to guard thats a great example of that nor shadir even though undiz still able to finish around and over top oh bigger Defender Baron again almost got that one to roll in hell draw the foul as Cleveland will get another personal foul 1721 to go here in the second under Couture driving touching the paint and then easily finding Robbie Baron who knocks down to three over a contested hand on one end of the floor and nor shadir attacking the basket even though L kids about 3 in taller still able to finish over the bigger defender in and out for Baron yeah Chad omir came into the season as a serious ACC Player of the Year candidate if you talk to Jim larenda about him he talks about how coachable he is what a great kid he is how every workout every game he shows up with a big smile on his face just dying to play yeah he hes hes a great conversation and you get a chance to talk to him and hes a you know great young man to be able to spend time around and he has had a tremendous impact on this program in the short year and a half that hes been here not a clean feed to pack shot clocks under 10 heres George he cant drive it spinning got free flips it up there follows his Miss and sticks that one fortunate for Miami because thats another one of those plays where you see see so many orange jerseys around the basketball and George with the spin move in traffic which is always dangerous you see potit right there just unable to come up with the basketball but give Kean George a lot of credit recognizing where the basketball was coming off of his own Miss and finishes it up so the Hokies to put it in Music potit back to padulla potit this goal is to get got it the goal is to get omir in foul trouble finished hit two in the first half and you can see right there the execution Mike young standing right there know telling his team exactly what he wants he wants malal Fati with an opportunity to get that third foul on omir and successfully does that and at the line so three on omir and a threepoint play for for potit malijah petite had 18 points two games ago versus Georgia Tech and he is truly grown and Mike Youngs confidence in him has grown as well yeah he had scored a total of 18 the previous three games rainbow triple will drop for pack thats a tough bucket outstretched hand of Hunter Couture took away all the vision of Nigel pack however Nigel pack can find the basket even in the dark Packs coming on 23 points against NC State in a loss this week and all of them came in the second half of the game heres Hunter Couture batted around and swatted right to Baron padulla Couture another one coming he like OB two for a dollar you know what it is same spot Two Shots you give a great shooter like Hunter Couture that off a second chance opportunity hes knocking it down and he is holds the school record for made threes 43 s this year in a whistle with 1539 remaining here in the second half and the hokes looking pretty comfortable right now on and off the court great story Big Time numbers two heres George out of the corner yes sir he swishes into three kesan George the leading freshman threepoint percentage shooter in the ACC shooting over 40 and this is a young man who couldnt buy one when he started off his career here in Miami but has since then the first after the first six or seven games has really gotten it going now padulla is so good at recognizing when that lane opens up that hes got himself a SE to get to the basket Joseph will scoop it up and drop in two benley Joseph nice move on the Baseline benley Joseph in my opinion can do more of that for Miami he is the true point guard for this team and that was a point guard play recognizing what your team needs and when they need it also an outstanding Defender heres kid padulla pack lunged out went for the Music Applause steel tulla got to 1000 points in his career earlier and now drains a long three and thats a tough shot not only because of the distance but also because of the defender kesan George did a great job getting a hand up with Shan padulla his great offense is even better than a good defense now look out if both Couture and padulla get it rolling here second half beyond that three heres Joseph again yes sir he swishes in a longdistance shot all of a sudden Miamis Catching Fire yeah but they cant get a stop thats the kicker can they get stopped on this end can they do what Virginia Tech did to them to end the first half and locked down defensively and Miami went two for their last 17 shooting it in the second half oh for their last 12 Couture turns fires he front rim that one now Joe pack trying to get an angle there he draws the foul before the shot 1343 showing on the clock here in Miami and heres our head coach our our close personal friend Mike young hes invited to dinner weve weve extended the invitation absolutely why not weve become great friends today actually weve been friends for a long time with Mike I know you have yeah but its always great to be able to hear the commentary and the coaching from Mike Young on the sideline he is locked into this game especially on each defensive possession popper around and out two terrific coaches here Jim Lena and Mike young toetotoe but only one can win and they both need the W very badly first later on at 630 first edition of Duke and North Carolina 630 on ESPN heres kid kid out of a double Joseph knocked it free three shot clock is a factor now down to three padulla will looft it up there he follows his own Miss batted around Miami on the Run Joseph thought about Music it pack dribbling into the paint and draws the whistle he gets hit hell be at the line to shoot two strong take by njel pack once again in another area where Miamis been better in this second half theyve limited turnover so getting the Stop and now an opportunity to get to the free throw line for Nigel Pac he can actually make this a fivepoint game number three on LY kid L packed the Junior from Indianapolis at the stripe here 78 foul shooter and heres our NBA Saturday Prime Time match up on ABC in the ESPN app Lebron and the Lakers their fifth consecutive Road game they take on the Knicks at Madison Square Garden our coverage begins with NBA Countdown 800 Eastern 5 Pacific extremely happy for my young fellow Jaylen Brunson being announced to his first Allstar team as well as two of my other young guys Tyrese Maxi and poo banero right down the road in Orlando so a number of first time all stars who all had big games sure after they tyres Maxi going for 51 at Utah jayen Brunson with 40 well this one tightens up 5247 Virginia Tech theyve got the ball here in Miami the Miami crowd coming to life Couture little stumble there and draws the foul as he hit the deck but a smart play by Hunter Cur recognizing that hes been called for a number of fouls when guys have tried to penetrate against him this time he puts his heads down tries to get to the rim picks up the foul and puts a little more pressure on Miamis defense trying to get into the Lane number one on Wugga popper so itll be sha padulla to check it in for Mike Applause young Couture again swe FES it in another triple the execution for Mike Youngs team out of timeouts and underneath and sideline out of bounds play has been spectacular for them throughout this entire game omir tried to Slither that pass over to Joseph didnt get there thats 10 turnovers for them yeah the first turnover of the second half for Miami though theyd be known such a great job handling the basketball well theyre going to get omir for another one thats going to be his fourth nor Chad omir with the body so thats the worst possible scenario omir turns the basketball over on one in the first turnover in the second half for the canes and then commits a foul that gives him his fourth which is going to cost him some time and he has been the guy for Miami here in this game yeah hes the best player on the floor hes going to sit for a while now at a key juncture into the paint poti nice little hook shot there he is so strong he absolutely is strong thats one of the reasons why Mike young likes him on the floor against nor Chad oir because hes one of the very few guys that can match his strength be surprised if he goes on a bit of a run here personally with nor Chad on the bench George got Airborne heres Joseph to launch and padulla lets that one roll on out so thatll be hoks ball when we come back weve got 1128 to go in Miami Virginia Tech Back on Top by 10 over the kanes and well see if the Hokies can really take advantage of that theyve got the ball back again and you see the numbers for Nigel pack but you also think about the fact that hes four of 11 from the field give hun Couture a lot of credit for the job hes done defensively on Nigel pack and remember Hunter coutur missed the first match up between these two teams a lot of good threepoint guys on the floor here for the hokes at the same time and another whistle 1109 to go Miami with a personal and thatll be on kesan George and the Hokey on top by 10 and another opportunity on an inbounds play and this is for coaches when they really get their opportunity to put their mark on the game with the actions going up and down you dont have as much input but right now this is where Mike young can really have his input Couture fakes Baron will shoot it and you got a great look on that underneath out of bounds play Just unable to knock it down Joseph boy thats a tough angle off the window for two yeah quick recovery by Bley Joseph getting from point A to point B not wasting any effort any effort to get Applause there okis looking to respond here potit hands off for Couture Collins coming up 177 against Duke this week he finds nichel for the jumper potit battling for the rebound and touched it last the officials say it goes back over to Music Miami Miami beat Virginia Tech in blackburg on January 13 the final was 7571 shooting 65 in the second half in a game that saw eight ties and 10 lead changes and thats been this series the last six or seven times theyve all been very close and please believe that Mike young did not forget that 65 that is one of the things Im sure he talked to his team about a lot over this last week and made sure they were prepared defensively to come in and you see that preparation is paying off Cleveland denied the Baseline shot clock down to seven Nigel Packs got to get a shot in the air its down to three now a threepointer no potit there for the rebound under 10 minutes to go Miami having a very difficult time cutting in in a lowscoring game Miamis a team gets about 81 points a game yeah they they never have problems scoring the basketball normally their issues are more on the defensive end but its been a problem for points here shot clock three on the spin to hand off potit trying to to go up strong and stripped to the basketball by Joseph and hes hip checked there by Couture who commits the foul and stops the fast break so number three on Hunter didnt play in the first matchup we talked about because he had been kicked in the head a couple of games earlier thats another one of those fouls though Hunter Couture picking that up thats his third and again he competing so youre not thinking about that but he has to preserve as many of his fouls as he possibly can because hes so important to be on this floor Matthew Cleveland to drive it went for the slam and denied and a foul on the play that would have been spectacular but potit made sure he didnt get it Not only would it have been spectacular but if he did not try to dunk that he would not have got the call he would not have gotten an opportunity at the free throw line if he tries to lay that up and that verticality goes right he doesnt get a call on that possession so a smart play by Matthew Cleveland trying to finish it off with the dunk forcing that contact potit fourth and Cleveland to shoot 78 there 915 to play and hell have another one coming and kid is coming back on the floor now for Mike young and so is George for Coach Lena coming into this season the question mark for Virginia Tech we knew about padul and hunor we knew MJ Collins was a rising star in the game but it was about the front Court how about the fact that Mike young now not only has one but two centers that can give them positive minutes when you think about Lin kid and petite as well it tightens up again sixpoint contest Shan padulla Applause nichel the pull up midrange thats a sweet looking shot thats a young man who scored a lot of points in high school close to 3000 points his mom cheers him on and he is very comfortable on the offense of the floor no matter what court hes playing on in the Virginia High School league he passed gr Hill Allen Iverson JJ reck among others in that incredible league on the scoring chart so thats getting it done Joseph drives finishes two tell you what where would Miami be without Ben Joseph especially here in this second half hes come off the bench and been extremely productive kept them right in it Nicholls going strong again lefthanded no Cleveland with numbers popper omir back in playing with four fouls and it comes free nickel reached in committed the personal exactly 8 minutes so Im thinking North Carolinas defense will be better than Dukes threepoint shooting so Carolina will take care of business on its home floor and thank Georgia Tech and damire for the wakeup call that they got on Tuesday even you said that before the game as poer goes to the line and sinks number one that maybe in the end thats the Wake Up Call I dont know if nor North Carolina really needed it but right in front of the Duke game maybe they did but it gives Hubert Davis an opportunity to get his teams ear again when youre always winning its often difficult to listen to coaches at least I will say thats for my experience but when you lose and you dont do it the coachs way often times youre doing it your own way it gives that coach more voice meanwhile here in Miami our first game of the day on a tremendous day and evening of college basketball this one has become a tight one 5955 Virginia Tech Im not sure why Matthew Cleveland allowed that basketball to go out of bounds they were going to get the turnover but he picks that up and throws it ahead Bley Joseph gets an easy layup and all of a sudden its a twopoint point Applause game omir up top back to George and the Freshman wont shoot Applause it Nord Chad oir strong to the rim the tip Cleveland got it to go now Mike young was hoping for some interference there on the iron no call there 5957 Collins Niel be on the three Collins thought about it hell drive it instead Miami comes away with an opportunity to tie it where where Take the Lead Joseph got it he Nails a three and Miami is in front by a point Joseph both these guys in the same class both coming in and having significant roles for their teams but laughing and joking and talking to each other in the this is what this game is about have a feeling they were talking about that play on the rim strong move by Couture as he hits the deck and draws the foul and Hunter coutur is off to the line where he is number three in the conference and that is great execution from Virginia Tech but also great recognition from Miami Hunter Couture over his last two games has had three dunks on that exact same play benley Joseph even though he gets there late he stops Hunter Couture from getting that dunk and thats something that of course Jim Lara and his coaching staff has prepared Miami for even though Couture gets to the free throw line hookies are five out of eight at the foul line get their 80 as a team Miamis made 15 out of 16 at the line they both these teams of course are great at the free throw line so thats something that will come down to the end but as you mentioned Obie the games between these two teams are always close theyre always nip and Tuck come down to the last couple of possessions we may be headed that way again with six minutes to go heres Cleveland open cant hit it Lin kid with another rebound head a huge rebounding game Hardy into double figures so its the hokeys by one padulla on the drive got by everybody and laid it in how about the hokes after surrendering the lead coming back with the Couture free throws and the padulla layup to build a threepoint lead back on the road that makes a difference Okies with very heady guards heres Pac with the pullup that Miss badley loose ball controlled by Virginia Tech and they lead it by three that whistle youre hearing that is the head coach Mike young calling out trying to get Collins attention hes going to drive it had it stripped the loose ball on the Baseline and Obie on the other end you see Jim Lena trying to get the crowd involved in gets some opportunity for Virginia Tech being that theyre playing on the Road and Couture out of a double for padulla he jumps and fires and it rattles home such a smart play by Shan padulla though not over penetrating getting amongst the trees but pulling up right around the ACC and now extending the lead to five for the Hop pack thats a long shot no rebound comes right to Collins give Hunter Couture a lot of credit got knocked down on that possession but fought to get back up and still contest the shot and not give Nigel pack a wide open look Virginia Tech looking for some Breathing Music Room padulla Applause gave up the dribble and gave up the basketball Joseph with it now hell pull up and pop again not this time he followed his own Miss though and smartly got it free to Cleveland yeah he knew that one was off chased it down immediately is a great job getting the rebound but not sure if Miami knows its only 9 seconds on the shot clock omir going in strong there in a blocking fou on padulla thats a smart play by Shan padulla because he is definitely outman on the Block trying to defend nadir and by trying to take that charge he doesnt give Amir the opportunity to get the easy bucket also trying to coax Nord Shad omir into a fifth foul and you see immediately and yeah that thats thats probably the even more important the fact that you want to try to get him that fifth foul but thats not even a shooting foul so its a one and one omir takes care of business on the first one and makes the pair 6562 Miami 17 out of 18 at the line and a pick by omir and he will slam it down on the other end of the Applause floor how about that backto back turnovers NORAD omir and Kean George with Steals and scores to give Miami the lead nor Shadow Mir getting out into the passing Lane picking it off finishing on the other end of the floor and just like that only one second half turnover after nine in the first half now both these teams sitting evening with 10 turnovers a piece well this is the way the series has gone the last few years between Miami and Virginia Tech Couture on the drive and finishes that boy it hung up there for half an hour strong attack from Hunter Couture trying to throw his body into nadir hes gimpy coming back something going on with that left leg Hunter Couture as hes trying to get back Applause defensively George a bounce feed for omir banging bodies with potit lays it off the window and Im not I dont care how strong you are its going to be difficult to guard nor Chad one on one one but of course Virginia check does not want the double at this point of the game long one coming off the side of the Iron by Couture Miami by one and the Applause ball pack with a quick step Cleveland gave it away potit came over and scooped it up padulla now with the drive cant finish it and finally there is a whistle but it took a little while was a little bit late but the whistle came in 229 to play but Sean hle in the right position you see the contact on the arm which forces the foul it doesnt matter if its late as long as its right thats the right call it was a foul on padulla going to the rim and it was a smart play by padulla MJ Collins was running the wing looking for the alley it was not the time to throw the alley OB nowel pack with a personal pulla makes 81 and he cant hit the first one now theyve missed a few and thats a bit of a headline for the hokes they hardly ever Miss yeah shoot 80 coming in ranked second nationally and now six of 10 today wow missed the pair and thats not something you see often especially from Sha badulla going to the free throw line and missing two especially as such a crucial point of the game such a big Advantage for them typically to get to the foul line late n Joel Pac over Couture no theyll get a second effort because of Matthew Cleveland those are the plays that Matthew Cleveland makes that Miami missed with those two games that he was out with the hip injury two minutes to play here in Miami George driving it around Baron scoop shot yes and a foul and the Freshman will be headed to the line Miami on top 7067 155 showing weve talked so much about nor Chad oir Nigel Packa we have not spoken enough about the impact that kesan Jorge has had on this team not only defensively but hes done a great job but making big plays down the stretch the steal in the turnover and now driving an opportunity for the threepoint play and gets it 83 at that line coaches Rave about his High basketball IQ and they love working with him hes put them in front 7167 he has 12 and if you dont watch a lot of Miami basketball game you might not recognize him hes normally wearing the afro I had to asked him how does he decide when hes going to do it its all a field as to when hes going to braid it up but of course his braiders here on campus so the hokes looking for an answer Shan padulla minute 38 eight to go block by George trying to get ahead on the Run gets around padulla and a terrific block by Baron he came in from behind and now a foul at Applause 129 Shan padulla looks like he got caught in between whether he was going to shoot that or not ends up being a turnover the good block by Robbie Baron oh that hit the glass first that should have been a goal tending OB there been a couple of calls like that here in the second half Cleveland at the line padulla with his third foul Matthew Cleveland just back to the lineup after missing a little more than two games with a hip injury and he started today for Jim Lena and makes the pair theyve been excellent all day at the foul line Miami has will it be the difference in the game they are 15 for 15 in the second half poti for couture couture and draws the foul with a minute 15 to Applause play and that is going to be number five on Nord Chad omir he has foued out and you see what a difference it is is for this Miami team when omir is on the floor Im not sure the rest of the Miami Team Four CS still on the floor they can this is the opportunity for them to be over at the bench getting coached up as are the Hokies but benley Joseph going to check in who has had a spectacular second half yeah Joseph has really been a man for them since halftime hir has been in foul TR trouble and now hes done for the day Hunter Couture to the line 89 for a team that oddly is scuffling at the line here down the stretch ptor the grad from Orlando and misses now thats three straight free throws Miss Hur hustling for the offensive rebound baren cant sink that another rebound here for Cleveland approach sing one minute to play giant misses at the foul line for the hokes over the top the Slam by Cleveland Matthew Cleveland going airborne 7567 padulla flips it up draws the foul and hell be headed to the line but you love the aggressiveness of Wugga popper not holding the basketball and settling but goes into attack mode and finds Matthew Cleveland for the finish a n 90 run by the Hurricanes down the stretch its put them in great position to get what we talked about as a must win here at home Shan padulla short well have another one coming 523 in the second half for Virginia Tech a team that comes in shooting 80 second nationally and now missing four straight free throws padulla finally makes one but three badulla won the front end of a one and one by Hunter Couture which are normally points that you can count on if youre Mike young and his sta oh Miami hting Big Shots making big foul shots down the stretch and what a lineup for you this weekend get this win on their home floor Miami of course going to the final four last year an amazing run had a great team but they lost key people Isaiah Wong and Jordan Miller two true star S one of them ACC Player of the Year trying to check it in now Joseph running on the Baseline and does get it in pack getting it across quickly precious seconds coming off that clock and they fin a foul with 49 seconds to go and Miami leading 7568 the turning point for this game OB was the turnovers Miami handled the basketball extreme well in the second half of this game I believe still just the one turnover for Jim LGA team and Jim Len has been in the same pose the same posture the entire game emotions have not changed when they were down double digits or when theyre up he has looked the exact same thats thats the sign of a guy whos been through this before and inside he is just jumping up and down for what theyve done the foul line heres padulla launching yeah itss the three Miamis made 22 of 23 foul shots today and another timeout except so far so a lot of implications will be take place in Clemson today its certainly feeling like Tony Bennett is playing his way into that field the inbounds here for George and a whistle and a foul 411 showing so the Hokies putting Miami at the foul line time and time again the problem for Virginia Tech is theyre simply not missing padulla with his fourth foul thatll put George at the line hes really had an outstanding day for the canes on their home floor and hell sink number one yeah he he is their unsung hero today he did a job defensively against padulla and again Padulas got his 20 points but Kean George made him have to work for those points but then the shots that hes made and plays hes made on the offensive end have been huge theyre going to get a second effort as Cleveland beat everyone to the ball and picked up the rebound and now nickel will reach and commit the foul Miami with a chance to put this game on ice at the foul line they missed only two all day so itll be Bley Joseph at 88 to shoot two OB there are things that coaches go back and look at wins and losses but especially in losses they look at free throws they look at turnovers and they look at rebounds Mike young will look at this game especially in the second half and the fact that this team did not make free throws and they turned the basketball over Puli got another look missed on that Couture fires it up there he hits a three trying to stay alive from that threepoint line 8074 more pressure here from the hokes Joseph slings it ahead gets it free and wga popper finally foued around midcourt with 223 on the clock and so itll be Miami back to the foul line with 22 seconds to play and this time itll be wuga popper another good foul shooter 82 sanf fact wuga once made 169 out of 175 in practice its pretty impressive did he say how many he made in a row no but it was a lot had to be had to have some pretty good streaks 82 hes trying to go four for four at the line today and does 8274 final seconds here from Miami padulla again but wont connect on this one and knocked out by Couture so itll be Miami ball and thatll do it 139 no more fouling now Miami locked it up at the foul line but they were down 6560 and turned this game on a dime at that point in the game and it was turnovers from Virginia Tech that gave Miami that opportunity to get back into it take that lead and then they never look back he
