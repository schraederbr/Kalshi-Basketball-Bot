Music foreign Music Center at Purcell Pavilion teams meeting between Notre Dame and Virginia Tech starting lineups presented by your local Toyota dealer Ben Allen Lubin The Freshman from Orlando made his first career start on Wednesday and responded with 13 points you better believe hes back out there for the tipoff though it was won by Grant basili coming off 33 on Wednesday night in the Hokies lost to BC Music pokies have won four straight against the Irish and early foul going on lasheski inside guarding Justin mutz and thats Tom lesevski he is vital to Notre Dames offensive plan but you take a look at Virginia Tech starting lineup Justin butts number 25 who drew that foul hes their jack of all trades player they run offense through him his numbers this season have been spectacular 137 and four and a half hes a guy to watch out for scoring double figures each of the last four games for Coach Mike Young whos been pretty successful against coach Mike Bray young 41 against Notre Dame since coming to Blacksburg as the leader of the Hokies the travel called on MJ Collins broke his nose last Saturday but no worse for wear wearing that mask he took a shot to the lower tip of the nose and Mike young was bemoaning why doesnt the mask cover the entire nose theres something to be said there but youll notice both teams could try to exploit mismatches when youre playing Notre Dame the ball movements usually really good and lesevski he is always in attack mode as he gets his first two points in 38 minutes on Wednesday s 150th game Dan Goodwin is 151st most in Notre Dame history much banks in the three banks are open on Saturday for Mr butts its his first made three since the 4th of January Im not mad at the set at all a little handoff and then a roll replace action with Hunter Couture the teams best shooter one of the accs best Shooters coming off the screen looking to fire Justin Muntz he took his turn one thing about both these teams they both do a great job taking care of the basketball The Early Travel call but no turnovers since Hunter Couture John Perdue is a leading scorer for the Hokies and he had a rough game on Wednesday so you knew hed look for offense early today well thats Notre Dame you have to communicate switches better with a guy like Sean Padula thats always looking to score communication is crucial you need to call out those switches better if youre Notre Dame Applause really strong on the interior The Freshman from Florida going to work gets low post position basily hes in the way doesnt matter Im stronger than youve been Allen Lubin with the end one Ben Allen Lubin consensus top 120 player in the country in last seasons recruiting class as The Seasons gone on Evans he has gotten substantially better and more comfortable on the floor threepoint play ties it up also gave basilia his first personal foul Muntz trying to give lechesky a second unable to do so and the Hokies turned it over thats good job lachevski being physical on the interior before we go too much further Terence lets get to our keys to the game presented by your local Ford dealer if youre Virginia Tech you better guard that threepoint line Notre Dame has Five Guys on the floor at one time most of the game that can knock it down but if youre Notre Dame compete compete compete it was one of the most physical shoot arounds Ive seen in my time around the game of basketball full court oneonone Mike Bray trying to send a message especially on the defensive end zilli off the mark from three so we were told by the Notre Dame sports information director the Notre Dame radio playbyplay voice Tony Simeone this is not normal as we sat here Courtside this morning and watched the Irish bang their way up and down the floor intense oneonone defensive battles and Mike gray was screaming at the defender to play with some attitude Applause well theyve started in the manner on which theyre playing offense right now he was visibly perturbed with his teams effort early as the shoot around started going I mean he became happier and happier didnt talk to us I mean I think that last loss he didnt talk to the local media after the game on Wednesday in Atlanta he sent Hamlet Tibbs his assistant he had Anthony weish handle the pregame on radio today I mean hes in a different mode right now and Hammonds knocks down the three Marcus Hammond from Deep Marcus Hammond he played for Greg paulus last season at Niagara hes a guy that can score a lot in a hurry while he hasnt been the scoring threat for Notre Dames that he was at Niagara last year he just another point guard that can handle the Rock Justin Motz Going Up and Under doesnt get the roll they got Lynn Kidd for the push on the rebound action first on kid I love Hammonds balance youre doing a baseline out of bounds you get the ball in look at his feet coming off patient Square fire away and finish Marcus Hammond excellent shot his 30th three of the season but at Niagara I mean he built over 200 threes on his resume six straight for Notre Dame since they trailed 52 Applause interesting day of college basketball well underway delighted youve joined us here at Purcell Pavilion Nate lecheskis three off the back iron no good and Men Jay Collins pulls down the rebound and I like that defensive possession right there for Virginia Tech why theyre pushing the catches out a little bit further making Notre Dame operate further away from the basket and that decreases your percentages from three MJ Collins rising up rebound tipped out of bounds last Touch by Kid and well get ourselves a timeout four minutes 20 seconds in interesting start Irish with the early 85 lead but after today therell be just two more left to the 23rd year head coach the winningest coach in program history who announced five games ago that he will step down after this season concludes what are the legends not not only in this conference the ACC but had terrific success at the Big East too uh really helped out with the transition into the Atlantic Coast Conference which helps but Mike Bray one of the most jovial guys even though he wasnt necessarily all that jovial today he had a different mindset and he was trying to get his guys ready to play which I respect and you could see the fire is still there sure now who knows whats going to happen next year Cormac Ryan for three extends the lead be surprised if Mike Murray sits on the beach for a year and then we just kind of casually see his name start popping up again in coaching service Applause theres a fold into the future prediction as the drive wouldnt go but the stick back is there for Lynn Kidd I like the aggressiveness by Justin Motz to attack Nate lejevski on the perimeter lejevski for what he is on offense sometimes defensively he can struggle keeping the ball in front but hes so good beautiful offense Lubin to lashesky Music the freshman kid has given the Hokies a spark here Off the Bench yeah but Notre Dame like we said earlier theyre going to attack mismatch its a little high low youre going to front the post make that entry from the top lejevski nice work sealing his man up the floor but Lynn Kia look at this Baseline spin quick effective hes at the free throw line free throw bounces off the rim a couple times and falls through the Clemson transfer JJ Starling into the game 22 starts this year but JJ coming off the bench for the third time averages 12 points a game for the Irish theres a McDonalds AllAmerican I think there were some people that were expecting him to be more point guard than two guard but starlings wired to score and hes got a big athletic body where he has the ability to finish on the inside I do like the move a little bit bigger in the starting lineup when you bring Starling Off the Bench looking to attack in his first possession and his three was off the mark rebounded by Hunter Couture either Couture or Dane Goodwin have taken a shot in the first six minutes here today so maybe its that time for Hunter to find his offense hell dish it as the defense collapsed Padula back to Couture in the quarter beautiful ball movement leads to three excellent ball movement third side offense if youre the Virginia Tech Hokies you love that action offensively the help side moves they get lost and Hunter Couture you can forget about it the best threepoint shooter in the Atlantic Coast Conference averaging right around 42 percent on the season this is a big time Big Time defensive ball movement Evan you attacked the you attack lejevski off a switch the ball moves thats a difficult pass but whenever your undisciplined shot fakes and so forth you can find guys because you get out of position at Hunter Couture I mean forget about it 418 percent from three on the season cant leave him that open Applause 43 threes away from becoming the Hokies alltime program leader itd be a lot to ask him to get there by the end of the season but uh he has another year of Eligibility if he wants he could come back and break AJ or AD visayos record five to shoot inside Matt Zona comes up short with a hook again butts pretty well defended but its Elijah Poteet getting a loose ball and the Hokies come up empty and thats a matchup based substitution mate Matt Zona doesnt play a ton of minutes but Mike Murray saw Malaysia potee enter the game and offensively both guys are a little bit limited its a way for him to steal some minutes hell go attempt for Zona that last trip was just his 11th field goal attempt of the season a guy much more involved in the offense cormack Ryan his second bucket today I love Cormac Ryans game his ability to create off the bounce off the off the catch hes equally dangerous just a terrific shooter that Zona cant do that the Doula went down on this youre gonna drive Baseline pull up over the top look at this action go away theres a switch step back knock through look at this hes too small gotta guard that man Cormac Ryan as the captain or president of the Cormac Ryan fan club are you accepting new applicants maybe Ill take whoevers willing to jump on board I mean so Shifty with the ball on his hands good size shoots over the top I mean hes had some major performances 30 plus at Cameron Indoor last season I mean the guy can score in so many different ways John Camden getting some first half minutes Padula rising up three in and out the rebound for JJ starling Starling looking for Lubin and basily had a foot on the in line it will be Notre Dame ball when we return eight minutes down tight game Irish with the threepoint lead it would appear that hey as he finishes his string at the Helm of the Irish but since he announced he would be departing it has become somewhat customary to gift the legend an object and Whit Babcock the director of Athletics sending this piece of hokey Stone which represents what Virginia Tech is built on a foundation that were proud of this is with Babcocks letter to Mike Ray assembled on brotherhood loyalty leadership sacrifice service honor and Duty the letter wrote uh read coach Bray you are rock solid and something special congratulations heck of a career Mike Bray heres a rock see thats thats the letter you would have written wrote something far more eloquent and poignant for the moment you gotta call a rock a rock Cormac Ryan has three more Cormac Ryan gets one in the midrange to start out the game it comes out of the break with a bucket one of my favorite players in the conference third three of the game for Notre Dame Hunter Couture to answer got it come on Hunter Couture his feet are set forget about it hit his last two one in the corner one coming off a screen big time shooters runaway threes like that not an easy shot to make oh wow Hunter Couture stronger than Nate lejevski whatd you see well there was a switch that occurred and he really embraced the physicality and lejevski wasnt on balance and what ends up happening Couture picks up his second yeah and thats a big foul because he starts off the game so well for two of two from three you need him in this game Mike young leaves him on the floor with 11 20 to play in the half Music looking for the dive but mutts was anticipating it well first Notre Dame turnover Irish second fewest turnovers per game in the nation only Penn State like the shrewsburys Nittany Lions averaged four turns per game and the Irish battle for the board won by bazilly and hes fouled and will stay at this end as Lubin picks up his second and if youre been Alan Luther you have to do your early work youre giving up about two maybe three inches in height to Grandpa silly get in his legs and push him out towards the ACC before that ball gets there Camden and its a good rebound there pulled down by Dean Goodwin who still has not taken a shot games first nine plus minutes Music a little step through and unable to finish Starling though somehow discovers the rebound gotta guard him luccheski dagger my goodness if theres one thing lazefski can do its knocked down catch and shoot threes his third bucket of the game off to a quick start a guy with over 200 threes in his career seven points unable to answer this time gazilly but mutts on the glass back up and in off the glass Music Its just tough hes just tough that he is and he can guard so many different spots here regarding Dane Goodwin out of the perimeter I mean a guy thats just so versatile in how he can help your team win Legends feeling saucy from the edge of the logo with Jeske drills another like that offensive possession get into the paint maintain playoff two feet you can find a big fellow outside when that defense collapses and jeffskys feeling some kind of way early in this game already inner double figures hes got 10 bazilly with a left hand that was Nifty the silly has 12 family members here today transfer from Wright State from Milwaukee to Milwaukee Wisconsin about a threehour drive for the bazilly family dad Michael his mom Lisa is an interesting game for basily has a little bit of a heat check butzilla was basically down to Virginia Tech and Notre Dame as his final two choices when he was making the decision of where he would go he became a hokie and hes got back to back hoops to bring Virginia Tech back within two I feel like this game is Just flooded with guys who can score inside and out Vasily after going for what 33 in his last con contest I mean hes one of those guys that can beat you from so many different spots Cormac Ryan lost the hand over covers Goodwins first shot circles around it out this is when Sean Padula is good look you have a ball screen coming oh right to left brazily fakes it dishes to charge number two on Grant bazilly so thats two off the tour our beggar part they just uh make it number one on Brazilian so they gave one of the earlier ones to someone else thats what happens look at Dane Goodwin getting out outside well outside the charge Circle actually thats where playing off two feet is so beneficial Evan get there you finish finish with a nice bounce pass right there makes it easier for you shouldnt have corrected myself that was in fact his second foul as I thought initially theres another foul Padula reaching in on Sean who also has family here today parents Bernadette and Dom has eight brothers and sisters God bless his mother I have two kids and Im not sure how I can keep up Ive got two as well and that feels like the right amount for me and you a lot of great athletes in the Padula family State Champs in a variety of sports coming out of Edmond Oklahoma back to the line 10 points already for Nate if the rest of his family is like Sean Padula thats a competitive household I think one of the things that gets lost kids play so much basketball these days theyre playing summer AAU for so long they kind of lose the ability to be competitive everything if thats not the case for Sean got a lot of dogging Music Applause Doula using the Poteet screen Music Padula tough Fade Away goes goodness stop and pop Sean Padula what a move and what a finish both teams shooting 50 or better in this first half Applause and a travel is called itll be hokeys ball when we come back we are broadcasting today with heavy hearts after the really devastating news last night about Jeff Charles who was the voice of the Hokies for five years and then spent the last three decades as the voice of the East Carolina Pirates Jeff traveled to New Orleans with the Pirates and tragically passed away we send our thoughts and prayers to Jeffs family and we will miss you Jeff you were one of the greats Jeff Charles Gone Too Soon at 70 years old Music foreign basketball teams sharing the floor today not a huge surprise that we have seen both light it up early well this is a game we werent exactly expecting a ton of Defense but you still got to get out there and contest but regardless whenever youre able to attack the paint make that defense collapse this is our two teams that can really shoot the ball from the perimeter and its not just the guards its Nate lejevski its Grant basili you see the numbers both teams can really shoot the Rock twopoint lead for the Irish whove made five of their nine triples and that Virginia Tech stand at 35 a little bit skewed because Hunter Couture whos the best threepoint shooter in the Atlantis Atlantic Coast Conference missed six games so you throw him in there it changes that number pretty substantially they have played better with him back although coach young said even when he was out there ever but he wanted him to come back saying hes not a cureall for all of our problems that was on display a disappointing loss to Boston College on Wednesday the Eagles were pasted it home by Kevin Gatess wolf pack today Music Applause has been terrific here in the early going and he just moves so well without the basketball Marcus Hammond drives right into the paint he continues to move his feet defense gets lost thats not one you can lose medullas response off the iron no good lacheski with 15 points in 13 minutes hes calling for it again sets the screen now trying to post up Collins inside hes got the mismatch lecheski in and out the Doula Carta by Goodwin come for a high low at the other end and is that going to be on lasheski if it is its number two and they call it on Hammond instead a little too physical in the post but youll see how the spacing changes with Malaysia poteets at the top of the key lashewski can just hang in there around the ACC makes that pass a lot more difficult because theyre not worried about poteets shooting ability from Beyond the yard but regardless Hammett a little too physical try to push him out but keep your hands up to where the officials conceived pots rebounded by Poteet although Goodwin poked it away it will stay with the Hokies you know after the loss on Wednesday Terence Mike young was asked by the local media what what still gives you confidence they keep turning around and put a little run together he said well Ive seen us be really good I know that we have it we got seven left lets go play well its certainly been in Spurs and I think the biggest thing was injury started to pile up and when Hunter Couture went out they went one of four I mean he is that kind of player for this team not just as a shooter but hes the teams best perimeter Defender as well much drawn contact Goodman thought he played pretty good defense but hell get whistled for the foul coach Ray thought he traveled to be able to take another look at it a little too physical Ill drive but you want to put pressure on the rim against this Notre Dame team because they have some guys that dont necessarily move their feet all that well laterally so what happens if youre able to make them collapse they dont have a true rim protector then you can find different ways to find open shots on the perimeter but mods staying aggressive getting to the cup hes rewarded for it hunts at his third school but what a player hes been for Virginia Tech after a year at High Point and a stop and Mike gray country Delaware Music Hammond working on Padula good defense look how the balls popping though for Notre Dame if that ball moves they have enough Shooters and Playmakers to where they can get some things going offensively problem is sometimes it sticks and thats when they struggle creating looks welldefended possession here from Virginia Tech and it leads to a Notre Dame turnover Applause Collins The Freshman from North Carolina playing through a multitude Applause of injuries excuse me he went to high school in North Carolina hes from South Carolina thank you for that correction having a little nudge on the shoulder there Clover South Carolina but played at combine Academy which is in Lincolnton North Carolinas Hammond knocks down and actually Patrick wessler whos redshirting for Virginia Tech his father is the AD at combine Academy which was started by Jonah bays and Trevor Booker who were my teammates in school about that we saw the wrestlers at the airport yesterday kid kicks it Collins sticks it man he has just improved improved improved if hes able to knock down shots from the perimeter my goodness youre not going to be able to take him off the floor hes such a quality Defender and rebounder he adds that perimeter shot I mean just so valuable to the Hokies two teams combine 11 for 213 Marcus Hammond the defensive effort has certainly picked up for Virginia Tech staying in front of the basketball and whenever youre not able to create easy looks or Closeouts thats when Notre Dame sometimes could struggle to get good looks on the perimeter plan with the zilli on the bench for two fouls Couture continues to play through two fouls nice pass again much the assist kid the layup and the Hokies Take the Lead how about that pass by months a little Barkley dribble drives doesnt get it turns his back two guys come excellent look in and out Zona and kid wrestling for the board jump ball will keep it with Notre Dame on the alternating possession in Virginia Tech theyre off and running and thats a good thing for their offense get a rebound and go MJ Collins forget it thats a quick finish Virginia Tech better and better as the game goes on up one here in South Bend Music Sunny no snow on the ground not the typical February weather here in Indiana 82 Run for the Hokies theyve won in this building before including most recently a couple years ago an 11 Point win January of 2021 okay so so Virginia Tech went over this inbounds play I want to say 10 times this morning at shoot around Dane Goodwins trying to come off a stagger screen and create something and they are completely blocking his path Mike young thrilled with his guys at the end of that possession Music matching wins with Mike Bray here today Music Justin butts another three and thats too easy then good when youve got it you do have to close out short but you at least have to make Justin months uncomfortable out on the perimeter he literally hadnt made a three in over a month since January 4th and hes two for three from Deep this afternoon good win hero X rejected by mutts loose ball picked by Camden Justin mutts defensively is so good and so strong he can guard outside and when you take him on the interior you can forget it he puts his chest on you thats tough and he Mr Collins is feeling some kind of way Mike Ray needs the time out the Hokies on a 132 run theyve scored the last 10 points in the game and the Irish say lets talk it over Justin Moss I mean you need perimeter shooting this is Sean medulla creating something for his teammates it aint good when youve got to get out there and contest a little harder mutz thats his second one of the game he doesnt hit many but he did that time but defensively this is where months thrives look at his verticality stays there puts his chest on blocks the shot Virginia Techs defense has picked up over the course of the last eight minutes or so Mr Collins a little in and out tough Fade Away jumper over the top The Freshman from Homer South Carolina for the tough bucket his season High Collins just 11 hes got seven already in the half meanwhile Muntz is already tied his season high with threes 100 run for Virginia Tech over the last buck 58 and Notre Dame theyve been prone to scoring droughts throughout the course of the Season theyll compete compete compete theyll go four minutes without scoring a basket thats what happened in their last contest I mean the last nine minutes of their game against Georgia Tech it was it was tough to get one theyre tough to create a look for teammates Notre Dames been good for 75 percent of games most times its just that consistency in how they can get good looks theyve struggled with Starling Baseline beautiful move and it even better for top of the key the skip puts Starling in a closeout and if theres one thing JJ stall Starling excels at its his ability to put it on the deck and finish around the round Applause Music lets call for the travel Im not sure I agree with that call but regardless the offense for Notre Dame out of that timeout little horn set Nate lejewski sees the help side on the bottom and starling attacks to close out and finishes excellent athlete as the Freshman from New York Applause Music Applause packed with great shooting solid offense two teams really desperate for a win putting it mildly Starling has another bucket see why he was so highly recruited JJ Starling his ability to get to the cup and finish at tough angles big guards help things work in just in months likes the threepoint line today oh Poteet on the glass surrounded by white jerseys theres one Hokie and hell get to the line what hustle from the junior transfer from Rice malajal Poteet originally from North Carolina Mike young told me he him a little bit out of high school that goes to rice has a big time impact on the glass and hes just another rugged big fella for Virginia Tech that you can throw at different lineups depending on who youre playing Terence theres a scoring discrepancy right now between the official stats Monitor and the The Stadium scoreboard weve got what the stadium is showing here at Purcell Pavilion but uh I and the stats monitor has 3835 so thats something that needs to get sorted out here Im sure it will at halftime Applause lachesky inside for two more hes got 17 and a half on Pace for 40 today and Virginia Tech continues to switch so hes going to get some looks around the basket as long as he doesnt get that many looks from the threepoint line I think thats where he can hurt you more but regardless hes been terrific so far for Poteet but he will get back to the freethrow line or he went one for two a possession ago Virginia Tech switching one through five and lejewski I mean you come across that is a heck of a pass its a legisk whos posting up holds his seal and finishes he is a high level score but today especially so timeout called by the Hokies use it or lose it mean well hopefully theyll get this scoring discrepancy sorted out over at the table across the way it was a cool moment coming into Purcell Pavilion today theres a womens basketball player here at Notre Dame Avery who obviously started her career in Blacksburg suffered a really sad ACL injury that cut her final season short first thing I saw when I came to the gym around 12 20 Mike young has given Darren Avery a hug Hunter Couture came over again Derek Mabry a hug those relationships continue to last once a hokey always a Hokie to love that terrible stuff though Mabry I mean ACL is never easy especially to come back from it in your last year of college that sucks Irish Womens Basketball team will be home tomorrow against Syracuse fellow Clemson Alum Kelly grahamlich at the airport yesterday shell be on the call for womens Hoops here at Purcell Pavilion tomorrow ACC womens basketball is just Bonkers right now theres so many good teams and obviously the Hokies in the Irish are two of the best both in the first reveal of the top 16 teams in line to host March Madness games at Castle and here in South Bend too Applause Poteet makes them both this time potique gave a good he gave some good minutes off the bench four quick rebounds got to the free throw line a couple times embraced some physicality from madzona Notre Dames seldom used big man but he was thrown in there today Notre Dames gonna hold for the last shot look for La Jesse to come up and set a ball screen either a pick and pop or a pick and replace down on the bottom good thing Goodwin three second difference game and shot clock lasheski from the edge of the logo give him 20 and the in the first half Nate lejevski its his show Padula Applause Padula what you can do sir I can do better the man from Edmond Oklahoma its the first half on a high note for Virginia Tech and I love it a little pick and pop for Notre Dame Nate lejevski is feeling it both teams shooting well over 50 percent overall what a game very few turnovers as you would expect with these two teams all right can Virginia Tech get its first road win of the year or will Notre Dame and prove to 107 against the Hokies in Mike Grays tenure Justin mutts back to work gets his own rebound puts it in Notre Dame showing a little bit of a matchup Zone to open up the half to take away what Mike young likes to draw up at the beginning of the second half good job Justin Motz taking advantage of a mismatch and scoring over the top and if you stepped away at halftime and are thinking wait I thought it was 44 to 40 they had an incorrect score as lacheski continues his onslaught so 4543 is now the correct count and Les schewski six off his career highs got 19 minutes to get there tough pass tough catch Couture versus Ryan pulls it back out for mutts and the rebound good win just seems to be wide open look after wide open look for both teams lejevski continuing to get easier Dodges his third foul and gets the rebound on the Miss from Lubin interesting match of Lubin and bazilly each with two silly only played Seven Minutes in the first half coming off a 33point game against BC on Wednesday as the mismatch has a foot over Padula my goodness 25 for Nate three level scorer today gets in the short post against a smaller shout but Doula just says forget it Im going to shoot over the top he shoots threes he attacks the bucket he posts up silly answers and what a game weve got back and forth we go I think both teams might score 100 in regulation thats the kind of game its been Applause I would have shot it to him rojevski well over half of the teams points he has been terrific 28 for Nate Applause mutts turn around no he shot that with no space lets see if he fires up another one Goodwin looking for his first points instead and he missed it right Music Applause with a little defense I havent seen a lot of it today Evan we have not you get the feeling whichever team can turn up the intensity defensively hes going to ultimately win the game and now the teams are getting what they want offensively I was about to say first team to 90 Evan I Im much more of a fan of that Applause lets see if we get a quick pick and pop but that leaves cormack Ryan open cant connect but when one guy gets hot from the perimeter theres going to be so much attention on him both players go to lejevski nice Cut Collins no good basilis tip in and out rebound finds Goodwin tied at 48 still its our fourth tie of the day Applause of course Thursday two days ago was the 10th anniversary of that unbelievable five overtime game in this building Louisville and Notre Dame nice finish by Hammond to put the Irish in front Applause four minutes gone second half bazillis open carries it its a horse competition thats what this game has settled into both teams knocking down shots from everywhere communication has to be key though and you have to guard the basketball when that defense collapses its really tough but on the flip side lejevski commanding so much attention that the paint has completely opened up help side cant come over each teams made nine threes inside to Lubin too close to the basket I think that might have been the issue thats exactly right itll pick him pop oh medulla finds mutts inside I like it and thats where Sean padulos at his best as a playmaker in a semi break you have a little drag screen coming over getting in front and giving him an advantage play and sometimes Notre Dame can ball watch Justin mutt sees that takes advantage Applause Music one shy of his career high as Goodwin Rises up and carries the freethrow jumper player you keep your dribble alive then what happens is the defense wants to stick he gets to that midrange level well hes really good he knocks it through both teams just taken what they want right now Terence butzilli has 13 to match much as the Hokies leading scorer Hammond finds himself open now rebound Couture its been a shotmaking clinic but Hammond I mean even then you know thats a wide open look right there oh good help being good one doesnt matter fazili scores anyway thats what it feels like it feels like a pickup game both teams getting looks off their first option in the offense have not had a foul called on either side in the first six minutes of the second half adding to the pickup Flavor now Im okay with that yes oh no complaints here much offensive foul Applause how about just as much you try to be aggressive youre getting through the cup yeah putting on an offensive display hes 10 of 13 from the field six for seven beyond the yard well eight points to start out before the first media I mean that is high level shot making it rains it pours for lejevski he that was a heat check on that last one but this guy whenever he gets rolling a big time shot maker from the perimeter take a look at todays Max performance brought to you by zMAX hes one shy of his career high November the Irish has scored 30 in a game since Matt Farrell did it against BC five years ago I think its a pretty safe bet that hes going to do it today but really attacked from all over the floor and hes attacking switches theyre switching one through five so hes getting some mismatches in the mid post hes knocking down threes on picking pops now youre going to have a roller place and theyre going to stop leaving him big time shot if you can make it but who else theres lacheski with a 30 burger with with 30 burger 30 piece McNugget that too that sounds better than a 30 burger doesnt it heres mutts pivoting and scoring inside over lecheski 15 per months and most importantly the Hokies have a fivepoint lead despite Nates great offense no longer leaving the chefsky as that one steep its just a short Music Applause second Miss and eight attempts from three basilian months though have combined for them compared to lejevskys Third so thats a big portion of that as well Ryan the rebound Applause first Miss for the Hokies in their last six shots I like the addition of Matt Zona number 25 for Notre Dame into the lineup because he adds an element of physicality hes a bigger body is he the most known athletic guy no does he handle the ball that well no but he sets good screens as he hammers Couture gets this guy wide open oh and Trey wurtz able to beat the buzzer with a clock winding down Santa Clara transfer Providence Day School out of Charlotte Applause works its a big time shot Padula missed it lachesky Bear Hugs his sixth rebound Irish tie it up at 59 thats what he can do get him in transition situations and JJ starling hes going to finish six four two hundred pounds Evan I mean he has all the athletic ability one to one when it comes to bigger guard play in a power five conference free throws coming from us with 11 25 to go weve been tied five times weve had five lead changes Justin mutton opportunity in the line when we come back but we are even courtesy of the Freshman JJ starling all right everybody its two of any of these for just six dollars get a hammer I dont carry my Chalet on me not every day not every day only when the vibe needs it I like that kids Vibes as you said during the break the Irish mascot is a jolly fellow he is a jolly fella look at him great school spirit here at Notre Dame entertaining back and forth game neither team is led by more than seven at any point were tied at 59 as Justin mutts steps to the line and breaks the tie with a free throw if you like offensive basketball this has been very aesthetically pleasing a whole lot of shots made not a lot of Defense played but my goodness shot making at a high level one for two for months Music has a careerhigh 30 points with a lot of time to add to it thats where youre going to see Starling continue to develop in a picture while he keeps his dribble alive and hesitates hell be able to get all the way to the cup Collins doing a pretty good job staying with Cormac Ryan Lubin with eight to shoot doubled down kick to Starling three is short good block out by Kid for the rebound pokeys now switching at four spots they have stuck Justin months on Nate lejevski trying to slow him down count it Padula said its my turn long step Big Time finish look at that last step is so crucial and Champa doulas lower body strength is really impressive I mean his ability to stop on a dime whenever hes pulling up for a jumper or take that extra long step when trying to step through the help I mean thats a big time finish theres a reason hes averaging so many points per game chatted with him earlier this year I think hes always had the ability but the confidence has grown so much from where he was from the start of the last season to the start of this season to now just to ascend in that department hes been remarkably consistent all season long I mean even through the last five games hes averaging 152 over the whole season 158 you know what youre getting from this young man hes a Bulldog a pit bull if you will attacking the rim and trying to score eight of three in 20 games in a row Dan Goodwin Music two points today see if they can get him going Ryan straight away three got it I like it he worked on that shot today after their intense shoot around I think he shot close to 35 or 40 coming off that exact screen and knocking it through and fedula aggressive tacking off the dribble earning two more free throws for the Hokies he worked on this shot time and time again coming off the screen getting his feet set and theres not a lot of wasted motion with Cormac Ryans Junction he gets it high the shooting pocket is up around his forehead he lets it fly and hes been consistent that way Music Applause 11 points for Padula 37 on the year is for Mac Ryan you know most of which have been off the move medullas got a dozen pokeys lead by three Music lets see the difference down the stretch Terence as we head toward the fourth quarter of this basketball game at this point Whoever has the ball lasts sounds about right fedula pretty good hedge by Goodwin Collins spinning pivoting scoring making George Michael proud Jay Collins getting in playing off two feet staying patient step through and finish broken nose and all Applause lashesky swatted from behind by mutts but the foul is going on the smaller Collins my initial thought MJ Collins you need to shoot this ball off the catch youre wide open but he saw a lane against a slower foot lejevski created a lane more than saw one oh thats right he saw it he saw an open ocean part of the Red Sea everything was there free throw line today coming up a little bit fast break presented by your local Ford dealer stick around for that coming up at some point here in the second half Music one of two at the line 31 points now for lacheski in his 150th game as a member of the Fighting Irish it has been a memorable one for Nate inside got it and won what a pass they come out they try to help and hedge them all screen and Sean Padula is able to get it there over the top an excellent read over the top of the Jessicas head off of the bounce Im dribbling up great catch big time finish Grandpa silly stating out the lead Okies started the second half just two for nine theyre eight of their last ten from the floor and they have their largest lead of the day Sport and possession here for Notre Dame Ryan deep three puts it in my goodness shot that from Chicago quarterback Ryans got 14 four for six from Deep whoever gets the ball last Evan is going to win this game its been a fun game Im assuming its a fun game to play in offensively as well Brazilian another chance for a threepoint play my goodness hokeys getting whatever they want inside blow on one side before Matt Ryan on the other he started to feel it a little between the legs action you back up Ill pull forget about it thats a bucket but Virginia Tech the high low he seals up top you get a switch you finish quick that might be one you just let go entry passes to the Post from the top of the key are the hardest to guard because the help side has to come so far excellent execution by Virginia Tech getting that look Julies now got 21 stretching the lead back to seven words using the screen from Lubin see what happens here Ryan tries another how do you feel quarterback smacks the crown this has been some kind of special shooting display both teams on fire all game long s first good win on the Block taking what he wants again Applause taking turns is essentially whats happening I mean if Notre Dames gonna win the game they need to get some stops because they are few and far between right now Hokies have made their last five shots heat check Central here we go cormack gives it up Hammond turns it over only the fifth Notre Dame turn up high Collins theres a lot of contact it was knocked out of bounds itll be Virginia Tech ball uh the president of the quarterback Ryan fan club is here and cormacs putting on a show for you and that is me and that is deep and that is in Virginia Tech up six but not if Cormac Ryan could do anything about it Music time for the Huggies game summary with Virginia Tech leading by six no shortage of shot making at both ends of the floor Terence I mean its been basically Two on Two And all four guys you see on your screen have hit some tough ones but Virginia Tech is finding different ways to score while Notre Dame is doing an excellent job hitting some tough shots quite frankly Virginia Tech has been a little bit more methodical it doesnt have to be a lot more without just a little bit more some high low actions those two big men have been really good pokies by six with the basketball out of the break Applause Music three is in the first half but theyve done their damage inside outscoring the Irish 3218 in the paint and foul going against Marcus Hammond its his third time I really like pokeys Ball moving all game long and thats a nice finish for Grant bazilly what a baseline out of bounds to play that was scripted the entire time that ends up in a cross screen for basily and you have to maintain eye contact with where the basketball is or else youre going to give up a really good angle excellent Spin and finish for the silly but an excellent PlayDoh Mike young peskys got the size on Padula double comes doesnt matter luccheski has 33 thats him attacking a mismatch of being the older player keeping his patience right you spin to the middle a little Up and Under And now Notre Dame going a little bit 23 for a possession how theyve been destroyed inside doesnt surprise me Monson the blind what a pass by Justin bus that got it there but basili dunks on everybody in South Bend six minutes to go the Hokies have made seven straight field goal attempts the 23 didnt work ever not that time it did wonder if theyll stick with it Hammond kicks it for Ryan hes been red hot air ball this one stick back up and in though then right place right time Applause look at the shooting percentages on the stat sheet doesnt make sense its well I mean Virginia Tech shooting 61 in the second half it feels more like 91 percent both teams bazilly gets another in front of his fencing family hes been aggressive today and for good reason I mean he has played terrific 33 last game hes got 27 today it feels like its kind of gotten lost in the shuffle 22 here in the second half he only had five points in seven minutes foul trouble in the first one Hammond answers foreign ball game not using a whole lot of the shot clock either under five minutes to play and yet Notre Dame has not been able to dig too deep into the deficit theyve been able to keep it close so theyre going to get a stop Virginia Tech has executed masterfully unbelievable facilities now got 29 a little stagger handoff set for Couture what happens one guy rolls the other guy stays High and it just seems like the high low action for the Hokies has been there all game offensive execution has been terrific shoot Hammond step back three in and out rebound to zilli this game is coming down to which team can get easier shots more consistently I know that sounds like a lot but every time Virginia Tech comes down theres a set that gets their guys wide open and theres Couture Applause and theres another high low bazilly with the 10th straight field goal make for Virginia Tech theyre 10 for 10 in their last 10 shots I thought it was the Nate lejewski show its turned into the silly show hes upstaged to 31 points for bazilly thats a good no call thats a good no call I thought lejevski really sorted a little bit too much this hokey team really turning it on Virginia Tech has broken it open their first doubledigit lead of the day with 332 to play three and a half remaining here at the Joyce center with Notre Dame trailing by 10 Now Grant fazili has absolutely taken over this game in the offensive end Grant pizzelli is acting silly and its been Cuts away from the basket dunk high low action let me work a little bit quick layup hes hit him from three two but its been his work inside the paint against the Notre Dame team that doesnt have a whole lot of Rim protection he has flourished today for the Hokies Music second half five in the first half 26 in the second half Justin mutz has nine assists in the game several of them on that high low action with bazilly here lately pokeys ball its currently up 10 their largest lead of the day 10 to shoot this trip for Padula working on Lubin needs help Couture is open dagger three in and out rebound startling maintain some hope but at the same time you use the entirety of the shot clock Notre Dame needs to try to score quickly here down 10 we can still make things happen but it needs to happen in a hurry Applause defense there on Ryan JJ starlings turn nope Lubin a couple chances finally he Corrals it and scores JJ Starling and heres the thing you attacked the rim like that you draw help and that opens up opportunities for offensive rebounding Ben Allen Lubin hell play that up a tourist Miss was the first field goal miss in Techs last 11 shots theyre 10 of their last 11 Notre Dame needs another stop if theyre going to cut this closer five to shoot Couture bumped by lecheski another offensive possession you used 27 seconds Notre Dame fouls and now youre in one and one for Virginia Tech this is a team whenever theyre executed theyre so difficult to guard Mike young runs terrific offense one and one here for Couture 72 at the line this season he earns the second well squeeze in a message from Coyote Tractor from my experience if you work the land you got to be a jack of all trades you gotta have a little bit of optimism and a whole lot of getgo two for two for Couture its got eight points the lead is 10 with two minutes to play startling missed it four had both hands on the rebounds deflected Music him getting in on the action showed some aggressiveness early attacking the offensive glass points for Lubin tied with Hammond as the third Irish scorer behind the chefs Hes 33 and Ryans 17 I would consider fouling right here if Im Notre Dame a minute and a half to go youve had a hard time guarding them and theyre using so much of the clock after this possession Broadway sixpoint game Mike Grays telling him to play defense if they fouled itd be a one and one Applause you see now even if you do get a stop youre going to be inside 50 seconds you havent been getting stops late whistle and MJ Collins will get three free throws and Id love to take another look at that were going to Cormac Ryan a little too aggressive on the way out guys thats a foul I mean should it have caused him to fall down no at the same time leave that alone thats a good defensive possession cant happen first free throws of the day for MJ makes it a three possession game by making the first hes still got two more MJ Collins 714 on the year upcoming schedule for Virginia Tech presented by Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina Music they go to Atlanta from here face the fight Josh pastners on Wednesday at mccamish for Pitt obviously Virginia Tech has a little margin for error but they are currently top 15 Ken Palm theyre 55 in the net theyre still in the conversation even at four and nine in the league trying to replicate what happened last year when they started two and seven and then rampaged on nine of their final 11 regular season games and then obviously had incredible success and the tournament included a win over Notre Dame timeout call will take it to 44 and a half seconds left after the three free throws from Collins to nine point deficit for Mike Brays Irish at Hardees no matter whatever the best basily and lechesky each crossing the 30point plateau today its been a lot of shot making from both guys lejewski in the first half facility in the second half I mean both Inside Out threats thats for certain but these are Big Fellas putting on a display today Hokies have 90 points with 44 and a half seconds to go you set first to 90 Terence you might be right its their most points in an ACC game all year oh wow goodness gracious just out of the timeout how does that happen out of a timeout you lose track of demand Baseline out of bounds set an easy cut to the basket and there was Zero contact there all that took uh I think 18 seconds off the clock they can get three points every 18 seconds they can overcome a ninepoint deficit and then some with 45 to go and hes fouled itll be one and one for Virginia Tech ninth Notre Dame team foul 411 remaining time to take a look at todays protected the paint brought to you by CPI Security we havent seen that much defense today Terence but theres been a little bit I was about to say that pain which it wasnt already dry thered be a lot there uh it hasnt been a lot of Defense but that being said Virginia Tech when they get out and run and MJ Collins thats where he hes at his best misses the front end of the one and one Notre Dame still has life Irish have made 133s today they could use number 14 right here Ryan looking for it much the rebound and now itll be two shots Ill beg your pardon thats this is the 19th foul here previous one was the eighth so itll still be one and one for Justin quality look I mean thats what you want you want something quick top of the key Cormac Ryan hes been able to knock down some shots from the perimeter off the bounds no dice on that regardless you need something quick just a month Justin mutts a man of two Master degrees Applause 18 points today along with eight rebounds and nine assists and he missed another front end wait now theyre saying were at 10 fouls and he gets two shots Applause one for three did it make you pick up the basketball big mink though makes it a seven point game good win bad pass it was deflected thats why 198 remaining Notre Dame ball bad pass but that was a heck of an offensive set a little Hammer screen on the back side for Goodman to get open thats one you need if youre Marcus Hammond get that ball to your shooter a chesky gives it up Starling and the and the Mike young cant believe it thats JJ Starling saying Im stronger than you sir 64 200 pounds gets to his left hand Drake kick hes just a big strong guard able to finish young man has a lot of talent now a lot of times High School seniors that come in they have this lofty ranking you expect them to make an impact right away its taken Starling a little bit to get his feet wet but really shown improvement over the course of the College of the conference portion of the schedule fourpoint game 15 seconds left crazier things have happened bazilly will shoot two foreign on the season but over the last five games 58 but he just gets to add to his point total Id be shocked if he doesnt knock these down the way hes feeling today shot a lot of free throws in his career 410 as he steps to the line here trying to put this game away Applause has a lot of family members here today having 12 of them what a good game to have a good game for him no question about it 120th game of his career always a good hokey contingent they travel well timeout was taken by Mike Young and theyre gonna sit down on the bench with 14 seconds to go I mean look great facility Super Bowl Sunday having a sensational Saturday thanks both free throws hes got 33 the matchless cheskys 33 and the Hokies have a couple of fouls to give so why not use them 10 seconds remaining Notre Dame can make a three here you never know they really need a long range shot its got 13 of them in the game another foul on Padula before they could rise in fire takes a second and a half off the clock this is a nice job managing the situation by the Hokies thats right try to cut it down as much as possible you foul make them take as much time off the clock as possible takes it no rebound Virginia Tech and its over the Hokies have beaten the Irish for their fifth straight time today they are up for 93 points and Win It by six here in South Bend what an offensive performance by both teams 9387 you dont see that all too often hope you took the over oh no question no question not a ton of Defense being played but man
