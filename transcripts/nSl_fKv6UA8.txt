Academy originally from Canary Islands Spain getting his first career start tonight for the Panthers Blake Henson fouled on the threepoint attempt but no that is going to be ruled a flop on Hinson heard the whistle thought it was going to be a foul but it goes the other way so thats the new rule coming into this season of college basketball theres no flop warning Music puts a lot of pressure on the referees and trying to clean up the game and get that out of the game and you know I have to say I agree what about you Jason yeah I mean its in nodded too you saw the shot of him there I think he

and brushing up on your Spanish for football Are you standing up breaking down and staying hyped for football good then youre ready a great story has magic Music and every once in a while it has miracles Applause because thats our story Applause Tony madlock the head coach in his first season at Alabama State you spent some time at Memphis and then had a year at South Carolina state as a head coach of that program really impressed a season to go for SC State now comes over to Alabama State and brings his son TJ with him said its been a pleasure to have the privilege of coaching his son and of course for the Panthers Jeff Chapel in his fifth year trying to get this Panther team back on track they had a win in the season debut over UT Martin before dropping three in a row to West Virginia Michigan and VCU some tough opponents for the Panthers to start the year but of course theyve been looking to have their roster back and fully healthy still trying to get to that point but John Hughley now into the game for the Panthers thats a step in the right direction without a doubt you lead the leading scorer from a season to go for Pittsburgh was all ACC honorable mention again mentioned made his season debut earlier this week against Michigan on Wednesday had nine points and one rebound against the Wolverines the Panthers and Jeff Capel continue to try and work John hugley back but unfortunately in doing so they lose jamarius Burton who is out today with a knee so trying once again to get that roster fully healthy and ready to go looked like Blake Henson traveled and he did and losing Barton is a huge blow for the Panthers hes a guy that can create off the dribble get into that midrange area knocked down shots and hes really good off the pick and roll you know so having Julie back and Burton together is ideal but unfortunately were gonna have to wait to see that Mars Burton had scored in double figures in all four of the panther games this season of course theyre hoping its not a longterm injury for jamarius he is such a key piece to their team and team with so many newcomers important to have a guy like Burton who was on the team last year had a good season for the Panthers after coming over from Texas Tech led the team in minutes a season ago for the Panthers his free throw percentage of 88 percent was second in the conference and so Panthers today operating without jamarius Burton Alabama State coming out in a 131 Zone how about that new Glee swings it over to Santos back iron rebound collected by Isaiah range he loses the handle so Bandy trying to track him down range dumped into ONeal who goes up strong defended by the Panthers and thats going to be Pitbull Applause Panthers did a good job of swarming range on the play wheres the tough pass forced the mistake in the turnover Applause he said Julius Alabama State coming out of the timeout in the 131 Music 4 minutes to go first half Andy swings Cummings Corner Trifecta off the front rim rebound Huguley hugely goes up strong on the weak side it was madlock and Santa was fighting for the board last Touch by the Panthers its a great move to go to the 131 Zone especially if a team is not used to preparing catch them off guard its not something you go through and practice every single day Applause maybe causing some problems for the Panthers who have missed their last four from the field and havent scored in about two and a half minutes mad luck through traffic and one Music you finish three the hard way Music coach cable talked about containing penetration something theyre gonna have to do a better job on for TJ madlock in his first game at Alabama State the season opener at UAB he had 25 points including five threepointers again he is the son of hornet head coach Tony madlock both were at South Carolina state last season and came over together to lead this Alabama State program Henson from downtown Applause looked like he wanted a foul call tool JP yeah thats one of the ways to get a team to come out of that zone knock down some shots Panthers with three threepointers already on the ding and tip the pass away came right towards us Applause and Alabama state will keep it Lee kinson coming off that big night Thursday had 18 against VCU already off to a tremendous start with seven points today on three of five shooting in the last threepointer getting it done inside outside like to see him you know not come out and shoot the three first got to the basket got him a dunk like Roger Ayers wanted to dry off the basketball there you resume Jordan ONeill inbounds for the Hornets Music Tree Pass low block turn around hook well defended by Hinson and hugely soars in for the rebound thats the big presence inside the pit has missed without him on the floor yeah that was a good look from coach Matlock I like that shot also Mandy Cummings is open from the wing he lets it Fly rims out Ellie Cummings trying to get that shot sorted out he proved that he can be a deep threat last year at Colgate struggling from threepoint range this season so far however Isaiah range hits one from downtown make it 1310 Alabama State back into Amanda man after giving up that threepoint shot from Henson hugely Aaron pass intercepted by madlock Hornets in transition poked away from Anderson Santos found after he cleans up possession Applause Music so remember Julius this was a 102 game we had the first media timeout the Hornets come back out in the 131 theyve been able to climb their way back yeah through the Panthers off a little bit made them stand around settle for jump shots if youre not knocking them down youre gonna let the other the opponent back into the game and thats exactly what happened so now looks like Alabama State back into mantoman throwing some different looks at the Panthers Music match keep changing it up so Mandy pull up triple rims out Panthers have already taken eight threepointers in this game theyve made three of them one of their last seven from the field Hornet Corner three Isaiah range six points for range two of two from Beyond The Arc Hornets are on a little 60 run to tie the game Applause Santos open for three Hinson tried to put back rebound Matlock Hornets with a chance to take the lead swings over Corner triple McCoy thats good Applause Alabama state with some first half momentum they take a 1613 lead over the Panthers and when we come back we tell you about the fatherson duo leading the Alabama State Hornets Music Applause Music Im gonna work you like a minute mule brother Music trying

Federico Henson who tried to toss it over to savandy Five pit turnovers on the afternoon opening down low Dwayne Posey foul on his way up Posey gonna head to the line and Julius for an Alabama State team that has struggled offensively all season they sure seem to have some things figured out today its difficult to play on the road you know obviously you had a disadvantage you know being away from home but you know one way to to reverse you know your faith basically is to see some shots going and thats what theyre doing if the threepoint shots are falling theyre getting some penetration it is gonna have to figure it out huge impact mentally right you see Johns fall absolutely you know its just dribble drives nothing special being broken on on off the dribble kicking out to open open threes

said they got to get to the basketball have to Fork have to get the ball in the paint you know you want them to shoot the three if its there but you cant just settle for you know every possession you can always get those threepoint shots theyre not going to go anywhere uh Panthers have to do a better job trying to impose their will theyre the bigger team to hinsons credit he has been the Panthers top scorer this year and he does time for the team lead entering today with a 33 threepoint percentage on the season Applause 12 points for the transfer from Iowa State played an Ole Miss as well Blake Henson thought about the three instead crosses up to Fender spins into the lane contact were all done by Blake Henson and there it is JP taking it all the way to the Lane yeah putting the pressure on him not settling again you always get the three not to mention when youre shooting 20 from 30 you should probably you know change it up a little bit thats what the Panthers are today 3 of 15 Blake Henson Jorge Diaz Graham and Nike said Bandy have made the three threepointers for the Panthers Hinson sinks the first free throw hes been such a threat offensively all season for the Panthers Thursday against VCU gotten foul trouble in the first half but came out in the second dropped 14 points in the second half alone he certainly has that ability to take over a game with his scoring prowess this is the second free throw that time about a four second difference between shot and game clock here end of the first half in Pittsburgh Alabamas team looking to increase their lead before the break Alex Anderson crosses up sebandy feed inside strong take ONeal bouncing around for the rebound Alabama State going to get one last chance but no Henson takes it away hell have a heave

of Threes Alabama state was efficient from downtown four of seven for the Hornets mentioned three of those coming from range and mad luck Julius what can fit do to turn around as we begin the second half tone be a great be the aggressor continue to I think they did a good job there at that Best winner attacking the baskets who look to attack the basket you know relentlessly Alabama state did a good job changing up their defenses you know keeping the Panthers off balance so I would stick with that the Panthers have to figure it out Hornets led by as many as 12 in that first half Panthers climbed back to cut it to three at the break Jorge Diaz Graham was in foul trouble for much of the first half hes back out there with the two personals on the afternoon Applause you really add some length to this pan their lineup when hes out there the first halftime lead of the season for Alabama State not a position theyre used to being in with the way their seasons gone thus far Owen four on the year Music offensive foul against the Hornets sure youre hoping at the halftime cool them off a little bit I can keep that same intensity Music Cummings one of six from the field in the first half made a twopointer Greg Elliott with the left hand Applause thats what you want to do three point wasnt falling in the first half changed it up a little bit mentioned jamarius Burton out today for the

Panthers Corral the rebound Greg Elliott and a chance to regain the lead for the first time since the 12minute mark in the first half Jorge acrobatic move Henson came up with it Posey grabs the board Applause you mentioned Burton not playing you know thats a huge blow for the Panthers thats a guy who can create off the dribble great for himself great for his teammates so you know not having that against a team thats changing up their defense um not having him out there that experience Music your whole your rhythm is just not going to be the same they need him out there aside from Nelly Cummings Burton really is their next option at the point guard position thats why Cummings has played all 22 minutes today hasnt left the floor now Anderson Fade Away jumper it was pretty Music for those shots knock that down once again that room will look bigger and bigger play with a lot of confidence and make things happen Henderson hasnt started a game this season for Alabama state but he does average nine points per game he grabs the rebound here for the Hornets theyre in transition bounce pass across range goes up contact no call Panthers grabbing Elliott running Diaz Graham and foul called against Alabama State Jorge was on his way to the bucket and that foul gonna go against Roland McCoy Junior Guard from Chicago for Alabama State hes going looked like he was dead right idea he

Henson has done in the pit uniform this year and hes got 15 points to lead all scorers in this one its in a return back to basketball I know when you sit out for a long time youll want to do the things that you didnt want to do the auto Sprints allow you Ill take the Sprints right now just to get back on the floor Music Jorge grabs the rebound Panthers once again looking to regain that lead

jamarius Burton are the two Panthers to lead the team in scoring in individual games we told you jamarius is out with a knee today which means Blake Henson is the guy 15 points on five of ten shooting and three rebounds he has not left the floor today and the Panthers Julius are going to keep going to him yeah its a blessing for the Panthers because they can allow Hughley to get some rest and not have to rush back oh cause thats the last thing you would want him to do he doesnt have his legs under him so Hensons stepping up is is you know major for just more than his production but also to you know allow them to take their time with hugely you can already see John hugely making steps in the right direction earlier this week against Michigan had just one Rebound in 22 minutes of play today Big John has six boards in just nine minutes of oncourt action Jeff Capel has mentioned that he made needs to make sure his conditioning gets in the right shape before he gets back out there on his regular schedule that led him to all ACC honorable mention last season Jorge Diaz Graham is a guy who has stepped up big time when his name is called since the VCU game his minutes have increased and hes been taking advantage of it Jorge and his twin brother Guillermo youre able to see the potential with those two from the getgo obviously not sure how long it would be until we saw them making a huge impact for this pit program but it has only taken a couple games for Jorge to make his Mark Bell hes battling on the inside and foul is drawn by Pittsburgh Jorge Diaz Graham having a day eight points has knocked down both of his threepoint attempts its a beautiful sight getting the bench in into the game brothers loving it only a freshman has a lot of upside were hanging Guillermo both came up huge especially in the first half against VCU Thursday game the team some energy when they needed it dealt with foul trouble in that one and Guillermo and Jorge played a big role Cummings comes off the screen and drills the triple Panthers on a 100 run theyve figured something out backtoback threes after having a cold start in the first half Panthers have hit their last three from the field

threw good money away when you bought those glasses next time go to Americas Best wear two pairs and a free exam start at just 7995 cant be fat cant beat this either book an exam today at americasbestcom a lot of reasons for Panther fans to be cheering is to see their big man starting to break but also Federico Federico right there running the floor making a defense Cavin and Blake being unselfish when he could have take that taking that shot gives it up for a better shot and Elliot knocks it down Panthers playing some team basketball in this second half and they Trail by three at the break in the second half theyre outscoring Alabama state 152 so theyve turned things around and playing the brand of basketball that they want to be playing right now jumping out to a 10point lead over the Hornets who have just two points in oh about seven minutes in this second half largest lead of the contest for the Panthers if Im coach capable Im replaying that last sequence over and over and over again to show my team what theyre capable of doing be at the top of the list when they hit the film room huh absolutely you know and Federico Federico running the floor it caves it in you know hes not going to get an assist for that but the reason why Elliott is open like that is because he ran the floor he didnt jog he got there early he turned and see what he looked for the ball Julian is whats also new for the Panthers this year is especially with Jorges rise over the past couple games frequently operating with two 611 guys out on the floor that helps this tough year protecting a rim rebounding trees down there because he says Jorges a wing you know he might see 611 in the gun hes a post guy but he can move plays out on the wing Federico controls the inside as hes showing shoot knocking down to three putting it on the floor you know the game has changed big guys who have the scale set of guards JP looks like Alabama State doing a little bit of what worked in the first half trying to throw a different defensive look at Pitt gotta put somebody in that sweet spot in the middle and try to seek the ball and get catches Cummings three in the air short hornets have missed their last eight from the field make that nine rebound Posey only two points in the second half for Alabama state after such an impressive showing in the first 20 minutes today but they are one of 11 from the field this half Music so the best defense may have actually been halftime code code Alabama State down a little bit sometimes that happens you dont have the same kind of energy that you had in that first half it doesnt carry over to the second half John hugely back into the game for Pitt enters for Federico rejection by Jorge savandy Euro Step and the Finish Music Applause great defense on one end nice Euro stuff on the other Music 15 unanswered by the Panthers Applause mad luck and the Run Music back into the one three one split the guy at the top get somebody in the middle thats going to seek the ball make a play has taken away Anderson Posey got a hand on it Posey the other way contact on the attempts of Bandy racing on the other end for the Panthers playing Alabama state will take over possession 10 point lead for Pittsburgh they found their Rhythm second half Music youre helping her study for a geography test but how can you think about states and

feel this is the softest material ever felt in my entire life I I forgot were rolling check out this Cloud T it is so soft you guys oh did it again sorry say hello to the cloud waffle oh wow second oh its so comfortable night and day the difference between the two halves so far today in Pittsburgh the Panthers who trailed by three at the break have found their Rhythm offensively you see the increase in field goal percentage this half especially improved from threepoint range they were three of 15 from Beyond The Arc in half number one much more efficient three of six for 50 here in the second half and defensively theyre getting it done on Holden ASU to just four points and I think is translating to the offensive and theyre not getting deflated every single time by them knocking shots down also getting contributions from a number of players first half it was largely just Blake Henson offensively for the Panthers but Henson only has two of the 17 this half for Pitt Nike sabandi Jorge Diaz Graham Nelly Cummings Greg Elliott all stepping up each of those guys with at least five on the afternoon foreign left with some room for the pullup too strong tipped away out of bounds Panther ball Henson hugely Indias grandma on the floor at the same time you cant be mad at the length and strength that you have out there for the Panthers Cummings in sabandi complete Panther five Manning the backcourt Cummings kick some Bandy threepointer from the wing Nike Swoosh they look comfortable now looks like they figured out that one three one coach cable may have drawn that one up you can see him step out set that screen on that top guy Music Bowman deep three off Target padlock got his own board goes back up Cummings comes up with it for bit Cummings fakes to pass to Hinson oh that was pretty from Nelly a great job from Henson to run the floor give him the option to even make that play just like that Pittsburgh turns it on in leads by 15 224 the second half scored and suddenly as well theres a lid on the basket for Alabama State screen on the top guy Nelly penetrate kick foot open shooter with confidence and again you know Henson running the floor that was a great move by Nelly but Henson running the floor gives him that option he could have just died and let Nelly go oneonone Jeff cable has talked about Nellie Cummings the Pittsburgh kid achieving his childhood dream of playing in the blue and gold said he can have a tendency to put some pressure on himself as Henson drains another one but Nelly feels almost responsible Julius for bringing this pit program back to what it was in the 2000s in the early 2010s and because of that really takes losses hard and wants to be at the Forefront of bringing Pitt back to its Legacy that was so known throughout college basketball yeah and I think he played he played a little impressed you know especially being from here that West Virginia game like I said was deflated them a little bit but you know I think coach cable just wanted to go out there and have some fun Cummings up to 10 points now for Pitt Henson and sabandi also in double figures Cummings Corner three Blake Henson drills it is this the same team we saw in the first half Julius you know when a shots so were not seeing things Music Applause it carries over when youre making shots defensively you get stops treat yourself to something spectacular get away to a place thats near that feels so far away Music Applause start playing and never stop playing you get the most from the game when youre having fun its now a 262 run for Pitt who has completely turned it on here in the second half after trailing at the break theyve found their Rhythm offensively especially from threepoint range six threepointers in just over 11 minutes this half Julius being unselfish with the basketball game penetration is open up the shots for threepoint Shooters you know theyre taking them and making them this game was 3431 Alabama State at halftime Music and theres the difference I think theyre getting a better quality shot first half they were standing around was flat this half the ball is moving theyre getting penetration sucking the defense in there getting better looks at the basket and its resulting in a higher percentage 31 points in the entire first half for Pitt they have 28 just over 11 minutes into the second half shots start falling teams start playing with more energy they have a little more life and it carries over to the defensive end Music Panthers of course came into today hoping that this would be a Get Right game after dropping three in a row to West Virginia Michigan in VCU Hornets gave him some trouble in the first half but now the Panthers certainly more than back on track here in the second half nice strong move hugely get their hands straight up got them with the body a little bit you see the shock on his face I did what the coaches told me to do keep my hands up in here dont swipe down and I still got the foul caught on me so thats the second on hugely not too much foul trouble for either team the only player in this game with more than two is Greg Elliott who has three foreign thatll be a sign of relief for Jeff Capel and the coaching staff mentioned earlier he played the Panthers on a couple of occasions this season against VCU just over a week ago here against West Virginia dealt with some foul trouble on as big a factor today mad luck three from the wing too strong yeah even offensively it seemed like they had a lot of offensive fouls called on them especially Nelly Cummings how about this day for Nike cebandi its good to see him get going you see his confidence starting to come back so big for Savannah mentioned he had six points in the season opener against UT Martin but then went the next three games without scoring so to come back today and have a 13point game so far against Alabama State huge for a guy whos coming back from an ACL Music uses the screen almost wanted another one instead hits hugely on the pub from downtown all smiles on the panther bench Applause now youre definitely going to have a long night when John hugely is knocking down to three what is it Billy the post Music thats very scary Julius can you remember a 10 to 12 minute stretch of basketball the Panthers have played better this season not at all its about as good as it gets exactly what you want to see if your head coach Jeff Capel aggressive foul on the rebound where we called on Dwayne Posey were under seven minutes remaining Panthers have taken control over the

Applause Music it has found its stroke from threepoint range six different players with a threepointer in this game and Julius they are seven of ten from Beyond The Arc in the second half and I think the best part of it is that theyre penetrating the basketball as you see Nelly Cummings right there kicking it out but its coming off of you know penetration Im putting the ball on the ground and being unselfish everybodys just getting in on the act like you said six different players knocking them down and its exactly what Jeff Capel wanted to see in this second half you see the difference and thats the game right there fifth 60 from the field in this second half a 335 advantage since the break I think it starts defensively also you know theyre getting stops I think when you get stops you know you play a little free on offense youre not as pressed to make shots because youre getting stuff so I think theyre theyre energy on defense has rubbed off on their offense and their confidence Music so Mandys had a hot hand but missed that time Hinson all the way across Court to Santos seven to shoot for Cummings and the Panthers too strong on the pull up Music not a good sight for Pitt as Blake Hinson is making his way over toward the bench weve got five on four basketball and they do blow the whistle Henson moving gingerly off the floor and straight to the tunnel Music Hinson has been the leader offensively all season for Pitt fortunately looks like theyre going to get a win today but Julius certainly something that you dont want to see have longterm effects if youre pit definitely not you know especially with them trying to work cubely back into the rotation the last thing that they need is for the guy thats been holding him down for them in the past four games to you know go down with the wings of injury the best wishes to Blake Henson hope that hes all right but imagine with a 23point pit lead you will not see him reenter today certainly not worth a risk reinjury to the Panthers best player in five games this year Guillermo gets his first bucket of the day off the window gotta love it real hard when you get the switch went down there and post up made a strong move Music foreign I can play basketball I can play too there he goes grants the rebound Guillermo tried to run the full court turned it over madlock Jorge almost came in for the rejection but a crafty finish by TJ Matlock ASU back into the zone Music Applause Panthers are doing a better job at creating off the dribble pressure off Target on the jumper Alabama State trying to do what they can to chip into this lead but certainly time running out and it has been the Panthers day in the second half and toast gave it away Isaiah range on The Fast Break goes up strong he gets the two Music time and possession when you have the lead the last thing you want to do is turn the ball over thats going to lead into them chipping away at this lead and once again with a turn over there Panthers got to do a better job of taking care of the basketball secure their lead Matlock with the scoop and score trims the lead to 19 Jeff Capel not happy the Panthers comfortable ahead no

have a Triscuit bring on the zest with fire rested tomato and olive oil with Triscuit foreign such an important performance today from Nike sebandi coming back from the ACL tear has struggled a little bit in the early going this season but today Panthers are without jamarius Burton needed someone to step up in the backcourt so Bandy has done just that 13 points on four of 12 shooting including two threepointers to go along with four rebounds and three assists so a great day for sabandi Julius Donald certainly helped to boost his confidence coming back from the injury and its something you definitely need because we know hes capable of doing it at Miami of Ohio he was a scorer so its not like hes a guy that you know isnt capable of doing it which is a matter of him getting his confidence back and being more confident after that injury started his college career by claiming Mack freshman of the Year honors over at Miami Ohio averaged 15 points a game that season after a few years there transferred over to Pitt really started to play well towards the end of the season in 2021 in the ACC tournament that year some of the late season games Panthers started to get excited about what he could do they were thrilled to see him return in the pit uniform and all those hopes got taken away when he tore his ACL in the exhibition game right on this floor and its been a really great story of him overcoming that adversity returning this year for the Pitt Panthers and when the team needed a spark today in the second half Nike sabandi gave that to him for sure for a guy with his skill set that likes to attack the basket having a knee injury well make you a little timid it takes time for you to you know get your Killer Instinct back and get back to that form that you were used used to before you got injured ah okay Applause Collision on the rebound bunch of players fighting for the basketball gonna stick with Alabama State TJ madlock the leading scorer for the Hornets with 16 points seven for 18 shooting from the field hes been the leading scorer this season for Alabama State leading them once again today but a team that just went cold in the second half and as he said JP important to credit the panther defense as well but a 3613 advantage in the second half for Pittsburgh I think it was the length Music the length of the Panthers finally contestant shots they made a little harder did a better job containing penetration when you do that youre not gonna get the quality shots that youre used to getting Music Cummings threepointer top of the key rebound Hughley under three minutes to go now Julius what can this do for Pitt in their confidence mentioned that theyre one and three he played some tough teams and despite Alabama States 04 record this is a panther team that just wants to see a win again and win this one have some easier nonconference games coming up against fairly Dickinson and William and Mary and those are the type of games that can get them back on track yeah its good for your Morrow you know when does it win like you said and you know losing is never going to have the mood around your program in a you know positive so just to get back on a wooden truck doesnt matter who the opponent is the win is a win it does have a couple more nonconference games against Power Conference teams they go on the road at Northwestern in the ACC Big Ten challenge in late November theyve also got Vanderbilts on the road in early December and of course theyve got an ACC start mixed in there as well theyll go on the road down to Raleigh take on NC State in early December to begin their conference sleep this season and be clear you know this Panther team has showed that they can compete you know against Michigan against West Virginia against these better teams its not like they just got ran off the court the entire game they show stretches where they can compete its just that against those those quality opponents you cant have those lapses they make you pay for it John Hughley says get out of my house sabandi tried to rock the rim on the other end but a foul called getting rowdy in here Julius if he would have finished that this Applause no suit for you if sabandi would have finished that dunk right there this place would have went crazy oh yeah Oakland Zoo students are on holiday break but it would have sounded like they were here and its good to see him attack the basket again thats one of those plays that youre a second guest coming from injury you know its good to see him attack it with that kind of vengeance reassuring maybe the best word to describe this second half for the Panthers again three straight losses they come in today have a rocky first half but come out in the second and contributions from guys who maybe they expected more out of through the first few games mentions a Bandy Huguley starting to get comfortable Nelly Cummings made some big plays in this second half and this Panther team starting to look like today what Jeff Capel knows they can be so Benji elevates and flushes it home Applause now from Alabama State you know you came in you played tough in the first half you know you can build off of that it shows that you can play with a quality opponent from the ACC a lot of things that a lot of things that they can take from this game and learn from thats the first threepointer of the half for Alabama state after they hit seven threes in the first 20 minutes today youll be wondering where that shot was all second half but the Panthers are 42 seconds away from their second victory of the season Music hugely putting the spin move on and finishes off the glass theyre having fun now they are its even better when you have Henson back from the locker room with a smile on his face on the bench so oh thats good news for the Panthers certainly a positive thats reassuring as well well wait further updates on Henson but as you noted a good sign to see him back out on the panther bench Thomas Sanders so gonna go down as a 19 Point win for the Panthers as they improve to two and three Julius yeah its good for them to get back on a winning track Alabama State got Duquesne next so theyre gonna stay in town hopefully enjoy Pittsburgh but its great for the Panthers to get back on The Winning Side so for Julius page producer Sarah mcluen director Tristan Russell
