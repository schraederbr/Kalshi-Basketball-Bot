Jordan Cornett you take a look at starting lineups of course for the Fighting Irish Starling works Brian and Logan hes been the Lighthouse for the Irish early on this season a true walking match up nightmare Suzuka will be challenged to defend on the perimeter Trey works with the rock driving Haynes its short and here come Pierre Brooks and gives it over and inside they go to Marty sissoko is knocked out of bounds good active hands from Goodwin there to save sissoko buried lachevski early on giving him too much real estate Soco might be one of the more physical specimen on the floor can he

couple of main Spartans out Lee call Jayden Aikens more on them in a moment heres Walker working on Goodwin Music shot clock to five seconds hogar to pull up knocks down the first two of the Night Barry cerebral move from Hogan took a couple broken dribbles squared his shouldersky good baseball pass then lays it in I try to get touches downloaders to Soco early on challenge the toughness of lachevski as an interior Defender such a skilled offensive guy try and maybe get him in some foul trouble early on worth exploring Joey Hauser Walker off the pin down into sissoko guard with three on the shot clock for Matt Ryan snags the board foreign by starling Applause Music this time into Hauser in the paint working on Goodwin turns no good Irish doing a good job not allowing offensive rebounding opportunities something without question the Spartans are going to look to take advantage of tonight Music heres the Jeske you see the spacing of the floor with the Irish JJ Starling lays

the Spartans to guard on the perimeter Hauser the triple too strong Goodwin the rebound Works will set the table for the Fighting Irish Starling hanging and draws the foul to be on Pierre Brooks look Im a team guy no question but I also enjoy watching Stars play basketball and tonight we have some legitimate ones early on that have established themselves yes JJ Starling is a future first round draft pick could be a one and done guys but tonight Tyson Walker has been everything for the Spartans coming off screens there must be an awareness of him meanwhile Nate lesevski we talked about him early Music trying to play through the 610 bench now listen Michigan State because of some of their injuries the rotation is small but theyre going to run in some guys and you see them right now theyve already brought in a couple of them and Brian you know that fatigue will be one of the big story lines coming in its a Spartans group that came you know without Malik Hall without Jay nakens went 21 in Portland theres definitely some logged miles there some fatigue on a court and not a deep bench Jackson Kohler and Jason widens checked in for the spartansi travel Burnett listen we played about five minutes here Michigan State hadnt scored in two and a half minutes Brian are kind of feeling themselves out a little bit for the Irish its definitely been an advantage theyre defending their contesting shots theyre keeping Michigan State off the offensive glass five to two the score here in the first half here you see here the Spartans on diesel Notre Dame basketball better start for the Fighting Irish coming off that loss against Saint Bonaventure where they started that game one for 12 had no rhythm offensively really gotta get into a a mode a rhythm of getting low post touches playing through whomever the big is on the floor Nate lishevski is a spacer guy played at the back to the basket be that safety bound to eliminate alleviate some of that pressure Spartans need to step up the pressure defensively and get back in transition Carmack Ryan went to the rack his shot blocked Applause and itll stay with the Irish Applause tray words will inbound Applause again you see the spacing Five Guys above the threepoint line lejevski the triple in and out now when you have five guys above the threepoint line there will be no offensive rebounding opportunity Spartans had to walk in the park get it and go Kohler the turnaround in the lane no good and here comes Notre Dame with the push Music eski driving plays it in hes got the third leading scorer in the ACC averaging 18 thats a favorable matchup lachevsky is good off the bounce you gotta respect him beyond the arms Kohler moves a little bit slow they will challenge him as long as he is on the floor gifted back to the back score Circle cigars heres Tyson Walker pull up in and out Applause Trey wurtz Applause and lejewski Diving misses follows no good tip and grabbed by the spark when the bunny becomes a bear oh Spartans have missed their last six shots theres Hauser trying to put it into the drought Irish are showing double on those low post touches Hauser Felton here itll come again you see with chefsky cheating Kohler double team pass nearly stolen holguard the jumper and they still cannot put the ball in the basket BC theyre getting good looks theyre just not falling right now for Michigan State youre running good offense theyre gonna fall ball of averages Kohler we talked about him slow with defeat thats all day Advantage named wisefski whos that hybrid big he shoots it really well beyond the yard he attacks the closeout beautiful footwork I thought the big fella was going to hook that thing a little bit easy peasy 72 Fighting Irish then Alan Lubin has checked in for Notre Dame Ryan

go make a basketball and play with aggression in space Hauser makes it happen Music all right Works got it for three this was coach izzos worst nightmare in talking to him he knows the Irish are capable of getting really hot like this already a high level shooting team but with the crowd here the first big stage the Irish are delivering early Walker driving he draws the foul stumble on offense on the floor for the Spartans right now that speaks to what theyre missing coach Izzo hes one of the best to ever do it in the game of Basketball Hall of Famer most wins in school history look 24 straight NCAA tournament appearances without a single losing season as a head coach second longest streak only vested by Kansas hes a legend he walks into the Hall of Fame when hes done look they need Malik Hall out here whos out with injury missed the last three games they need Jay napkins out here as well they need guard but Malik checked so many boxes for you theyre fully healthy its a different look but right now theyre trying to survive theyre trying to weather the storm in the first eight minutes but in talking to coaches so he said look Malik just does everything hes kind of like not the same type of game but a Gary Harris we know Gary Harris was the Spartans does so much and then Jaden brings that defense but a twoway guy Difference Maker yeah you see Hall had that boot on that foot stress reaction in his left foot going to miss a couple of weeks getting it against Villanova the fact they went 21 in Portland speaks to the culture of Michigan State Dane Goodwin from Deep Applause Music fifth year captain Upper Arlington Ohio Houser working on Goodwin thats Mouse in the house you got a scoreboard issue that theyre gonna have to get right here in the arena that is not the score 168 should be our score heres wurtz behind the back kick out Goodwin short Holloman pushing Music 11 minutes in the first half Hauser one dribble pull up no good win comes down awkwardly and hes limping best threepoint shooter lets see if hes okay Notre Dame up early Michigan State owed a lot of credit for the Love of the Game of college basketball another big personality of that with Digger Phelps yeah absolutely Id be 26 Hall of Famers during his time how about how about that Notre Dame Squad too I mean Manny carried for three first rounders yeah absolutely theres a look at Dean Goodwin went down awkwardly something to monitor there hes coming back out of the locker room not quite Willis Reed asked I dont even think the crowd notices right now but its big to have him back to do it all guard for this group and one of their senior leaders yeah absolutely fifth year Captain leads him in threepoint shooting and hes grown up with whom Ryan knocks down the triple wide open Michigan States loss defensively and just put his shoulder into him and guards the trial charge is hogar thats a 610 big and Nate lishevski running back to a spot understanding the assignment to get back to the space to take the charge meanwhile on the other end the Spartans shorthanded indeed the spacing all these guards catching a triple threat position ready to make a basketball play overwhelming Michigan State defensive yeah besides Malik Hall Jaden Akins as well not playing tonight theres lost Ryan and the floater hes got eight cant say it enough they need Jay naked they they need Malik Hall how about Ryan defensively by the way how about this start by the fight in Irish I mean this this does not look like the team that took on Saint Bonaventure this looks like a team that played their worst game of the young season first saint Bonaventure lacked an offensive Rhythm and Coach Bray really beaten to their heads weve got to be who we are make quick decisions move the basketball take advantage of a shifting defense thats what were seeing from the Irish right now vintage Notre Dame offense especially at home inside Hauser working on the shesky kick out hogar the triple yes beautiful offense weve seen that from them early on here the shots just not falling maybe that can turn in time for the Spartans here heres words he turns the corner shot at The Rim thats

screens contesting keeping guys in front Goodwin faking and scoring as good as Brooks is as a shooter quite simply hes just not there yet as Defender Goodwin understood that from the Scout and hes trying to take full advantage didnt have a clean look but new Brooks would break down on the play eventually and he did oh guard shot knocked away and stolen Ryan they work it around the perimeter Five Guys again down a threepoint line thats Notre Dame basketball Music the Irish were shooting 50 from the field 60 from three and Brian they have yet to turn the basketball over when your offense

Portland go two and one Im here to tell you Michigan state is still one of the best teams in the Big Ten theyre without two key pieces right now and theyre tired and theyre getting exposed right now by a Notre Dame team that sorely needed a night like tonight and theyre getting their best in the first half at one point Spartans were ranked as high as 12th in the country Brian theyll be back and theyll be theyll be higher than that they just have to weather the storm theyve got to compete for these final three minutes chip away at it the Irish wont cool down in the second half what do you have in the tank then if youre Michigan state that needs to be the mindset dont look at the scoreboard theres a turnover gotta convert transitioning oh guard Walker the triple is off back the other

overtime can I get a break and he looked back at him and said uhuh you gotta play its a tight rotation until they get a little bit more healthy thats what its going to be for right now now clearly you cant go into conference play not in the ACC and truly be a factor with six and Coach Bray understands that theyre gonna get more healthy but for right now a couple of Sammy Davis Juniors on the squad hardest working fellas in the business longer minutes Georgias North Carolina guys went with four overtimes against Alabama Caleb love took 173 shots in four over hogar driving by the way hookers got four personals as well Music with the camera I didnt see one smile how Are Notre Dame fans not entertained with what theyre seeing from their team here especially with how they looked a little bit

this Michigan State team on your floor no question time out by the Spartans Porkys the fiery passionate outgoing guy tonight his offense set the toll 23 points wildly efficient eight of ten from the field how about this though currently six of six from the threepoint line no Notre Dame player ever in this building has gone a perfect six for six from three ever if he stays at that line all the great shooters that have come through have never been perfect from three at that clip that many three six of six thats the kind of night quarterback Ryan is having that note came from the great temporary assistant athletic director of Clemson well Notre Dame fans would probably remember I think it was back in March uh tournament time when they took on Alabama he had seven threepointers against Alabama in that tournament game also had a careerhigh 29 he is the the vocal leader of this team Dane Goodwin is one of those leaders and captains Nate lesevski Trey wurtz all those guys important for leadership hes the voice in practice in layup lines in a locker room during turbulent times he guides this group four minutes Music darling off the glass hes in double figures so good controlling his body as it distorts through the air especially through contact all great finishers eye on a goal thats him Ryan snags the board Applause you know the interesting thing there were so many people talking about this Notre Dame Squad because even in their wins they were you know by seven by three and people were saying look at the caliber the teams are playing and theyre just squeaking by then they take this lost button to Saint Bonaventure but it was the way they lost it the bodies pushed him around kind of physically dominated them people were starting to question this Notre Dame Squad I think they answered some a lot of questions tonight yeah on their home floor first real juice in the building and you remember as a player when the fans show up to watch on your home floor its a different level of what we used to call the ju ice the juice its a little bit different and they played off that tonight no question ask for Michigan State look theres no coach I admire more in coaching as a whole outside of basketball than that man Tom Izzo this Michigan State team is going to compete for a Big Ten title when theyre healthy this year theyre gonna be just fine theyve had a long stretch here wipe the wipe all this away put this game in the rear view nothing to learn from it theyll be fine they just need to get healthy yeah listen the last big 10 program to
