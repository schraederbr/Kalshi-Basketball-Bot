played on Tuesday has made it to Friday and the Wolf Pack saying we want to be here tomorrow night as well lets see what happens Virginia controlling the Applause tip Reese beakman the senior just a terrific year leading the conference and assists and how impressive is that given the low Tempo and I mean dead last of the nation with which Virginia plays fewer possessions but he still leads the league in assists ree Pikman there an assist right there if mcne knocks it down and you cannot leave Isaac mcne we talked about it in the open he is their best shooter when he knocks down threes Virginia is a different offensive team its a team that can struggle to score but not as much when hes banging shots down what has NC State done well this week to still be playing here tonight they have gotten excellent contributions from this guy Casey morcel and then Mohamad diara has been rebounding as a fourman hes able to switch out on guards and Michael oconnell has turned into a scorer in this tournament he is six of eight from three and hes had double figure scoring games Tony Bennett won a national championship hes also won two ACC tournament championships got to the final in this building in 2016 lost to Carolina Turn Around by DJ Burns wont go and it back come to who and thats going to be a wrestling match Jordan miner going against DJ Burns minor a guy who gave Virginia some very good minutes second half and over overtime last night 40 minutes wasnt enough they needed 45 minutes before they took care of Boston College in the quarters got to keep an eye on mcney another good read by Isaac mcne NC State tried to Gap that screen on the Baseline so he just faded into the corner he doesnt miss many of those he is an excellent threepoint shooter shoots 44 from threes made 75 threes on the year after that first one went down Virginia 23 and9 137 in the league the three seed a net of just 50 though 2 six in Quad one neutral CT over Florida at Clemson they didnt do what some of the other teams in this league did they didnt beat Carolina they didnt beat D they dont have a ton of wins that just jump off the page at you but they have Jay won 23 times this year they beat Florida early in the year only played Duke in Carolina once which is unusual diara an air ball on the three hes made 17 threes on the year but that was not the best quality of shot that NC State could have gotten they were off the first pass launching that up tane Murray is starting a game hes a junior starting a game for the first time in his career played very well in their regular season finale and then played very well last night against BC and Tony Bennett put him in the starting lineup tonight thearrow went flying Burns backing down his man and laying it in Miner is strong but is there anybody who can keep burns from backing you down when he really wants its a choice that Tony Bennett is making usually in the packline defense Virginia will send a double team when the ball goes into the post but DJ Burns catches it so far off the post theyre deciding not to double from a long stretch beautiful pass from beakman to Ryan Dunn for the FLH that was a little screen in that sides smob blocker offense by Ryan Dunn and you put two on the ball and that little pocket pass is really difficult to deal with done the 68 sophomore from Freeport New York outstanding athlete also a member of the all defensive team in the ACC look youre going to see Virginia try to run a lot of slip action off of screening oconnell into diara turns to face on mcney Good Help by dun it will stay with NC State now take a look at the right side of the floor here you can see Ryan Dunn setting a little screen for Reese beakman now when he sets this screen beakman pops out then when he drives it two go on the ball that little pocket pass in between the two Defenders and an easy score for one of the best defenders in the country Ryan dun DJ horn is checked in for the wolf pack as morcel knocks down the jumper as the shot clock was expiring horn a fascinating guy for State leading score on the team is back from a hip injury didnt play Tuesday night against Louisville they won without him did play the last two nights got more and more minutes started the second half last night and he may not be 100 Jay but hes still really really good and they like him coming off the bench the save at midcourt by Murray Isaac mcne playing with an ankle injury Twisted an ankle on Tuesday he was a game time decision for the BC game chipped out done the extra pass and now as is always the case Virginia not in a hurry at the offensive end of the floor good fade screen Murray misses the three the tip winds up in the hands of Jordan Miner and he lays it in Ryan Dunn able to knock that ball to Miner for the easy bucket NC State was right there for the rebound you just got to grab it they split their two regular season meetings both in January each winning on its own home court needed overtime to win their game Burns again and well have a Virginia foul here going against Ryan dur how do you guard DJ burns on a back down its like trying to guard a dump truck or in right now a pit a very interesting team Jo lardys got them first four out they played Carolina tough came up on the short end in the semifinals big jigsaw puzzle lots of moving Parts all you can worry about winning the game youre playing well that first photo in that array of that 1976 ACC tournament championship team for Virginia what a good pass by ree pman you saw the great Jean Corgan former athletic director of Virginia Notre D was the commissioner of the ACC there wasnt a better administrator in college athletics than Jee Corgan so tell me a little bit about the Ralph Samson era and how one of the uh the greatest college basketball players ever and you played in one of those years are you overlap by one year yeah we played I played against them three times and my therapist says I dont have talk about it anymore all right so lets leave you out of it as difficult as that is for you and lets talk a little bit about that era of ACC basketball I mean that was a great Virginia team obviously what was it like in those days how tough was this tournament well people my age like to talk about the 80s and early 90s being the Golden Age of college basketball especially in the ACC because players like Ralph Samson stayed for four years Michael Jordan left early stay for three but the league was by then fully integrated you know in the 60s it was not but just a a magical time with so many great coaches and you made all ACC you were a lottery play more teams now of course nine when you play correct eight when you played 15 now and we are down to three in this years Edition with Carolina awaiting the winner of this one couple of Subs in for Virginia Andrew Ro has checked in Jake Groves as well who had a very nice game for the Cavs last night of the win over BC yeah had 15 points 11 rebounds four of them offensive rebounds he was a huge reason that Virginia was able to get past Boston College in overtime so at the line ree beakman the senior from Milwaukee and what an outstanding four years he has had last night against BC he didnt shoot it well four for 17 but 11 points 11 assists to tie a career high seven rebounders hes are great defender he played 43 of the 45 minutes Jay 24 hours ago cant believe they took him out for those two minutes but re speakmans truly one of the great defenders in college basketball and hes playing with another one of the truly great defenders in Ryan D I mean if Ryan Dunn were named ACC defensive player of the year I dont think there would have been any surprise that those two were onew in voting so beakman the first guy to win it two years in a row in over a decade Kevin ke has brought in Ben Middlebrooks also Jaden Taylor has checked back in and this is the guy you really got to keep an eye on DJ horn diara will take another three and this time hell hit it an under control three for diara thats his 18th three on the season and how good was he against Duke 16 rebounds and four blocks to go along with 14 points and didnt he have 14 boards the night before against Syracuse been spectac ker grow just dribbled it into a double team and middle Brooks takes it away NC State is going to have to get things out of the second action because Virginia is so good at guarding the first great feed by oconnell to Middlebrooks to send him to the free throw line its a good job by NC State and DJ Horn of making that little throwback and Groves has to close out with a hand up to discourage that shot that was just a little bit too easy for Mohamad diara and this has been a struggle at times for NC State but its really a struggle M for Virginia Virginia one of the poorest free throw shooting teams in the country 362 teams 354 the Cavs middle Brooks at the line as moreel checks back in how about as NC is trying to close out the game last night against Duke and middle Brooks misses a dunk hangs on the rim and is called for a technical so instead of getting two they dont get any and then a free throw at the other end and probably took a couple of years off the light of Kevin KS watching that but he did tell us this morning you know because we won I gave him a hug he said had we lost the conversation would have been a little bit different I love all my players but they could smile about it a little bit after but boy that was a moment moment where if you were a wolf pack fan I mean you probably couldnt believe what you were seeing well theyre very fortunate NC State that they had the possession arrow because after hanging on the rim it goes to the possession arrow it wasnt just a a basket interference call what did you like about State the most in their win of Duke last night because theyve got so much fight right now and theyre getting contributions like the contributions of Michael oconnell have been fantastic what a great pocket pass and diara muscles it up and in BO the open side screen and roll theres nobody there in the corner so you dont have a tag Defender and that was a beautiful pass you know its funny this is a 10 seed against a three seed I dont know about you in my mind this kind of felt like a pick them game coming in because the Wolfpack are playing so well right now no question and but anytime you play against Virginia theyre so hard to play against kind of like quicksand Boston College found that out in the second half a deep deep three around and out for Andrew roie the 66 sophomore Milwaukee as soon as that shot goes up three Cavaliers are sprinting Back Horn and roie runs down the loose ball Virginia games the slowest Tempo in the country very few whistles very few fouls and generally quite low scoring but really physical this is a physical defense great cut and the lay in for McNeely you think of him more shooting the three but a nice Cut to get a layup it is so important to stay attached to Isaac mcne but he has improved as a cutter more a catch and shoot guy last year but his cutting is dangerous Morel his first two years in Charlottesville now his third year with the wolf pack Middlebrooks gets it to go now Middlebrooks they can come and double but Virginia deciding against it oneonone in the post one of the toughest things to guard in basketball and are the Middlebrooks minutes vital just to get Burns a little bit of rest on the fourth game in his many nights no question Dante Harris in the game former Georgetown Hoya hes from right here in Washington DC mcney open in the corner cant leave him you just cant leave him set a little screen and then went right to the corner there were two on the ball you just cant afford to leave Isaac MC alone 44 from three on the season and a Wolfpack foul to take us into the time ever won the National Championship when they lost in the quarterfinals of their tournament so that thats bad news for Kentucky and Tennessee is here a 1414 tie just past the Midway point the winner to play the Tar Heels tomorrow night roves with the shot fake shot clocks at three haris knows it drives it and blocked from behind thats Brion pass who made a terrific defensive play which the shot clock negated a little transition opportunity I wonder what the over under on the first transition buckets going to be in this one Ill give you a choice first half or second half what do you think or theres theres door number three which is not at all might be the title Burns remains on the bench Middlebrooks still in the game pass getting some minutes finds Middlebrooks who reverses it up and in good play by both of them well nice shot fake and drive to get in the lane by Brion pass you dont see Virginia give up the lane that often but it grew help and he was able to dump it off the Middlebrooks and he is not necessar barely a guy who plays in every single game for the wolf pack but again remember fourth game in his many nights for the pack so maybe Kevin Keats will go about his rotation just a little bit differently their energy looks pretty good though porn and a goal tending call count the basket and theres a transition bucket with good hands by NC State to cause that turnover this is a very low turnover team but Reese beakman took it into trouble the active hands of NC State eight giving him a rare run out against Music Virginia well one team likes to play so methodically and the other team likes to speed it up whenever they can its such a contrast in styles with NC State switching a lot of these exchanges think really good pass anytime you curl that action you put two on the ball theyre going to find the screener but I think slips are going to be open for Virginia off that action with switching you can slip it but you can also screen your own man which makes it difficult for the switch good pass Taylor finds Middlebrooks and what a night B Middlebrooks is having so far Virginia is getting beat on some of that open side pick and roll and you usually theres someone there in the middle of the lane Isaac mcney needs to stop and be there Ryan Dunn not there either thats just way too easy after the screen because theres nobody there in that right corner thats awfully difficult to guard to pick up that role man and again these middle Brooks minutes are vital for State DJ Burns is not a 3234 minute a game guy certainly not with the fourth game in his many days Jaden Taylor putting good pressure on the ball grov knocks it down and gets the whoos back within two well he can really shoot it shoots about 48 from three thats his 49th three of the season two years at Eastern Washington two at Oklahoma now spending his last year in Charlottesville that Groves played with his brother Tanner Groves at Eastern Washington Tanner is the Big Sky player of the year what a beautiful pass to Ben Middlebrooks they are really moving the ball well and theyre doing a good job of growing off those screens and finding openings but it is really difficult to complete those passes against Virginia this is one of the best defensive teams in the country top scoring defense in the ACC pass deflected dun tips it out to beakman and skying for the rebound is whos giving State some energetic minutes peakman just a 33 threepoint shooter Middlebrooks here comes the H that pass was in the air a long time and its deflected out of bounds to Virginia since 2007 this would mean a lot for this program if they can win this game tonight no question and a proud NC State tradition started by ever case back when they played the ACC tournament at Reynolds Coliseum DJ Burns back in for State Jordan Miner back in for Virginia reys beakman knocks it down beakman now with four points hes also got four assists already in this game Virginia back within two just played with great Pace coming off that screen got Jaden Taylor on his backside just kept him in jail and state has executed very well in the half court theyre finding the rle man and pick and roll action and so far Virginia deciding not to double the post look at that screen my goodness that was like running into the Lincoln Memorial team he got up about as quickly as he went down but he went down hard after getting run into by DJ birds talk about the immovable Applause object beakman using a screen from Miner who cant get it to go and it belongs to oconnell and state Miners got to knock that down theyre looking to attack DJ burns when they can in that screening action make him defend and recover everything revolves around burns when hes in the game a ton of post touches theyre not doubling and a foul is called on miner that looked like more of an offensive discard from DJ Burns he pushed off with that right arm now watch a push off Applause here and that thats a foul on miner Tony Bennett was begging for an explanation look where Burns has to get it all the way deep in the corner trying to work his way in the Lefty up and in how do you stop that its like trying to guard a taxi cap and as you said the decision is do you let him get his or do you double him but hes a good passer and then you open yourself up to being vulnerable to three thats the problem is it takes him a while to get that shot off so theres time coming off the clock but it makes the other guys stand around and so youre not having DJ horn launch threes and DJ horn has made 91 threes on the year Jaden Taylor a little bit short tipped out and Beakmans got it for Virginia one of the advantages that Virginia has they play in close games all the time yeah theyve had a lot of narrow victories theyve gone on the road a lot this year and kind of gotten blown out but their wins have been very close so theyre not theyre not phased by having to execute in late game its just where they live they did it last night against BC in the quarters probably why Tony Bennett has some gray hairs but Im jealous anyway yes as we pointed out to him at shootaround today hard for you and I to have any empathy we would trade places in a heartbeat fourpoint lead State four minutes to go first half Yara called for the Applause Music Applause foul DJ Burns is hard to stop when he gets a little momentum forget it hes going to score with that left hand and hes also hard to move hello beat BC last night and right now Dan NC state has been executing very well on the offensive end the pack shooting 58 and theyve got 18 points in the paint that second action is getting Ben Middlebrooks free mcney misses the step in jumper Burns saves it you mention it oconnell has broken out offensively he only averages about five points per game but hes been in double figures in all three games in in this tournament 166 and 12 yeah he scored 44 points hes 14 of 22 from the field in the tournament six of eight from three and he made seven threes in the prior 17 games coming into Washington DC Brad transfer from Stanford pass knocked away Miners got it for Virginia well Connell threw that pass to diara instead of away from the defense and Miner was able to take that away you got to pass away from the defense Miner the screen beakman the three and its a onepoint game just too easy horn had to go under instead of chasing beakman over and inside of that threepoint Applause line that is the fourth three of the night for the who States only got Applause one now watch this pass into Muhammad diara the pass went right to him instead of throwing it away from the defense you have to throw it to his right hand and then watch DJ horn here going under the screen got caught up on miner and that just gave an easy three to ree Bean Morel thats a tough shot it rattles out and itll be Virginia ball with a chance to take the lead lots of fans from both schools here Virginia is the closest about 2 and a half hours away righs about four four and a half hours away and so great representation for everybody still going here to the ACC as beakman gets it done again so patient coming off that ball screen just off the left elbow he got DJ horn caught up on it and instead of blasting off of it horn goes over this one and he go instead of he just kind of plays one a little bit backs up and then goes right at DJ Burns whos not necessarily going to jump he just reached in really expert use of the screen and Roll by Rees beakman now Ben Middlebrooks comes back in the game Middlebrooks has been really good as a pick and roll roller hes got 10 points hes four four from the field just the first on burns but he Applause sits Morel cant get into the pain I used to say that playing against Virginia was like being in a 2hour dental appointment but dentist got really upset with me banged home my o Connell hes having himself quite a tournament but now I refer to playing against Virginia as like being in quicksand you can move around at first but sooner or later youre going to be up to your neck yep tied to 27 beakman again Miner and a jump ball is the call and the possession arrow will give it to the Wolfpack that was a foul on diara watch this like this is not legal guarding position thats a foul so the tie up was actually middle Brooks down low but that was after diaro went Applause Music Applause Music flying mconnell tries to turn the corner M Neely stays in front of him final minute of the first half how do you get away from Reese pman blocked by Dunn one of the better shot blockers in the ACC got to get it up oconnell knows it shot clock violation one of the who fans favorite things they didnt call a shot they call it they kept it alive heard the horn but they kept it Applause going Applause Here Comes mcney so good off those curls little fade screen well defended by diara BR in the corner misses the three its tipped by Dunn and Miner lays it in morcel was trying to block out Dunn and Dunn was just able to get a hand on it so did morcel but it went right to Miner for an easy Applause bucket a good block out but just a a heady play by Ryan dun and a timeout with 20 seconds to go here in a twopoint game in semifinal number two this tournament in this building in Applause Music 2016 shot clock turned off I dont think you can wait too long to get in some action because sometimes the second action is whats going to get you something against this great Virginia Defense fouls to give a common occurrence in a Virginia game so mcne gives one and they can do it one more Applause time if you know theyre going to get one get into your shooting motion as quickly as you can ell Drive switches hands and raay it in that was impressive Applause DJ horn starts the second half we talk before the broadcast Defender fell down now Reese PMA with an easy layup but we talked before the game started about staying with Isaac mcney he had a couple open threes in that first half that cannot happen for NC State Virginia the three seed State the 10 seed playing its fourth game in his many nights here comes the the double they waited until DJ Barnes got right next to the Lane darara with a shot clock at Applause seven just a force and it wont go and a good defensive stand there by Virginia especially by Ryan Dunn they did a good job of doubling as soon as DJ Burns got toward the lane you know he catches it so far off the lane thats a long distance to cover on a double team hes such a good pass he can find an open shooter great pass speak of good passers yeah beakman finds Miner heres Andrew roie who didnt start the game but hes starting the second half beakman no dun comes up with the loose ball cant finish it and burns a onehanded rebound for State Virginia able to keep a few of these rebounds alive so the second guy winds up getting Applause it and off to Horn now oconnell and again a touch for burns it always seems to start with him getting a touch good pass and diara lays it in DJ Burns an excellent passer hes having to go to that right hand in the the lane hes a lefthander but a really nice cut by Muhammad di to make himself available for that layup Burns played about 11 minutes in the first half middle Brooks the other nine well Virginia makes you guard so so many screens in this moover blocker the big guys are screeners and the guards are Cutters oconnell with a Applause steel didnt like the numbers pulls it back out so hard to get transition against OK conell and Miner down with it for Applause Virginia Burns right now trying to dry off his hands on his shorts obviously got some perspiration and that dribble was getting way away from him to the other end andc State doing a good job of just mucking up that screen for the screener action in the middle of the lane its a fist fight to get open right now beakman for three and I think okell got a piece of it and its out of bounds it still belongs to Virginia Applause Burns just backing down Miner and when Ryan Dunn comes over to double in the middle of the lane that just opened it up for that little cut by muhamad diara for the easy basket Burns is a really good passer hes got excellent Vision the issue is the shot clock was reset and now the officials going to the monitor to see if the ball actually grazed the rim it didnt hit anything I dont think so either Applause to2 the shot clock will be reset to 12 seconds came up short didnt even hit the Applause net Applause so one point2 on the shot clock beakman to Applause Music Applause inbound thats a pretty good play right there Jay well you cant worry about Ryan Dunn coming off to the right side you worry about the lobed to the basket NC State gave up an easy one Ryan Dunn can jump out of the gym and you just saw evidence of that okell offensive foul just lowered that left shoulder he had the angle didnt need to do that just gave up the offensive Applause Music foul heres the inbounds play and Ryan Dunn lets that space clear and Michael oconnell just on the wrong side of him you dont have to worry about him coming out to the short side and taking a jumper you want him to do that he been using the screen extra pass from Miner to roie rebound Applause diaro good offense by Virginia but they just cant knock down the shot shot goes up three guys are back for Virginia just so they can take away transition good Step Back Horn cant get it to go you take a quick shot then you spend 30 seconds on defense it becomes a time of possession game beakman the kick done not an outside shooter Miner swings it to roie roie gets it back McNeely has it blocked and a foul called on diara diara got a piece of it but his body just went into Music mcne lean up top but one of those you got to let him land right after the ball was already Applause gone no issue with the call right no yeah its a foul theres nothing we can do about it and its three free throws for McNeely now Virginia is a very poor free throw shooting team 64 as a team McNeely is an exception 87 boy you youre not a Roundup guy I got I got 88 I round up from that 876 stand by youre making me look at the notes MD Applause Brooks 873 oh give him a break we can round up now with the two makes I think hes up to 88 now only 8 for 18 last night against BC but they won the Applause Music game fourpoint lead to Virginia game that was tied in the half i go back to some more ball screen action now its two ball screens slip and stay by horn screen by horn try to get Taylor open diara into Middlebrooks the double he just fights his way through it gets it back and its Virginia ball Blake Buchanan down with it good stand by banan a lot of body contact no call now middle Brooks is steel boy is he having Applause Balls bouncing off the people its out of bounds and still belongs to the pack 443 into the second half Virginia leading by four Carolinas won 18 last in 2016 one of these three programs is going to win a championship here tomorrow night big bucket for DJ horn to get State back within two strong Drive caught the ball on the left side just put his head down got all the way into the lane thats not the norm going against this Virginia packline Defense Virginia go into more screen roll situations good fake and another one by grov a shot fake and a pass fake but then cant knock down the shot and now State TI Take the Lead but that was a smart play by Mohamad diara just to fly out Jake Groves just to run him off that threepoint line get him inside the line boy what a screen by Middlebrooks and draws the foul and Ben Middlebrooks is the best version of himself here tonight he is helping this team in every way right now well hes so good running into that ball screen and then he laid out Isaac mcney but then quick into the roll and Groves had to come over to try to take a charge but it was too late to get Music there that play will be under AAL review Applause and the last play is under an official review right Applause now is it the possibility of a flagrant on that foul call I guess just guessing and I dont see what I didnt see anything flagrant in it it was a a collision but it was looked like a a clear foul to Applause me thats just a standard charge BL yeah we have not been told exactly what it is theyre looking at so but theres nothing flagrant there obviously at least that we can see not sure whe theyre trying to figure out who the foul is on was on Applause Groves if they were looking for any kind of elbow I didnt see Applause it Kevin Keat just made like an elbowing motion as he is talking to one of the officials AJ deze so on the North Carolina State Side they must have seen something that led them to believe this maybe could be upgraded to a playr unless it occurred off the ball thats possible but if it was the main action of middle Brooks you know rolling to the basket and the foul on the ball I didnt see anything there and now AJ is going to come over J maybe well get you to take off your headset and we can get a little more info foul see what he got just looking to see if middle brks got hit with an elbow he said prior to the blocking call I believe what whatever it was no flaking midd Brooks the line NC so Middlebrooks at the line already 10 points five rebounds and a couple of steals in this game hes been active in setting screens and he rolls off those screens and its up to the Virginia Defense to pick up that role and its not been as successful Ryan Dunn returns for Virginias Blake Buchanan sit down and as well as Middlebrooks is playing that gives DJ burns more time to rest on the bench theyve been splitting the minutes pretty evenly so far tonight and theyre better defensively with Ben Middlebrooks on the floor because he is a very good pick and roll Defender as a big guy and Virginias been going to a lot more screen roll action than their sides action that move blocker stuff theres a screen roll up top and got McNeely replacing back up Applause Music Applause now back into their mover blocker beakman kicks to Groves open for just a moment left it short and an easy uncontested rebound as Virginia was they were all getting back so horn brings it down for the wolf pack easily knocked out of bound still belongs to state NC State well we are 6 minutes and 4 seconds into the second half and each team has scored six points it was 2929 at Applause Applause Music Applause halftime yep slips the screen still lots of time B in with Groves again being very physical but he missed it hes just got to power right through Jake Applause Music Groves Murray off to McNeely back to Murray what a challenge middle Brooks got Applause him Taylor counting NC State leads well Taylor just went right into the chest of Isaac MCM and backed him up just a smidge for that little step back jumper that was not an easy shot nothing is easy in this game Jaden Taylor a couple of years at Butler before coming to Raleigh averaging about 17 points per game in his last seven Connell doing a nice job of staying with mcne getting over those screens you have to go over with and chase him off the line open on the Baseline beakman ties it up now 14 Jay he carries a heavy load for Virginia on both ends of the floor second Team all ACC and a lot of folks thought he would wind up in the first team with what he does at both ends diara air ball I dont like that shot that was not a smart shot by muhamed diara you work so hard to get the ball back you cant just give it up with that kind of shot hes now one for four from three the wolf pack one for nine another block by Middlebrooks and another good job by Dr from running throws off the line horn a Miss diara runs it down OK Connell wide open it all started with the defensive play by Middlebrooks and you are never going to be more open than when you get an offensive rebound now a block called on oconnell Kevin heat is stomping mad but hes got to like what he saw the last time down the floor he like what he saw defensively from oconnell he was in legal guarding phys as a primary Defender great time of year it feels like the college basketball season J goes so quickly its more of a a Sprint than a marathon at times and now theres just so much to talk about and focus on over these next few days a lot of decisions being made on whos in and whos out and seating is going to be important as well a three for tane Murray to tie it up tane Murray had 11 points against Boston College when five of six from the field he is a shooter that you have to make put it on the deck OK Connell tough one got it back out of bounds still belongs to NC Applause State and DJ Burns getting back into the game after several more good minutes from Ben middle meanwhile Jordan Miner is looking overgrown Laughter Applause really and the battle begins he wants to get to the left hand Miner wont let him and theres a foul Applause call well with Virginia deciding not to D ball theyre just saying look theyll give you that tough too and no Tony Bennett doesnt want Jordan Miner to foul there but thats better than having him kick it out for an open three or a drive of a close out its not like theres any foul trouble for anybody so if you got to foul him hes a 66 free throw shooter you know to give you an idea I mean Jordan Miner knows where the weight room is he is 68 242 and DJ Burns is just so huge that if he decides hes going to back you down theres not much you can do about you just have to stay between him and the basket try to make him take a tough shot without fouling knock him both Applause down three guards are the Cutters in this move blocker offense the Cutters are the movers right yep very good thank Laughter Applause you so Dick Bennett offense Tony Bennett fad the great coach from Wisconsin Stevens Point University of Wisconsin Washington State and if you want to know about it you can go on YouTube and you can find Dick Bennett talking about it about the whole mover blocker scheme Miner beating burns down the floor diara had to come over and help left gun open but he missed the layup Miner just waited too long go up right away just allowed the defense to Applause recover horn on the drive the floater no and Miner the rebound DJ Burns looking at the official saying I got a Applause hit beakman nice look off to Applause Murray Miner swings it back to beakman the pull up short diara has it for a moment it looked like NC State had a chance to run there had been precious few transition opportunities for either team in this game the arino NC State two for 12 from threepoint range and a timeout taking by taken by Tony Bennett twopoint lead in the semifinals we punch your ticket to the championship game now its place your sticker North Carolina awaits the Music winner MC Neely running around a couple of screens hes the shooter you got to keep an eye on once the balls passed to come off a fade screen Miner double team Morell saves it really good help by DJ horn to knock that ball away I think thats a seventh steal that NC stats had in this game Middlebrooks back in for burns for the wolf Applause Music Applause pack horn cant find a seam oconnell is open around and out on the Applause three and is always walking it up the court The Who and very patient deliberate trying to wear you down mentally and physically and get an easy look and they do right there for tamee Murray just curling off that fade action on the right side seen her L all these Cuts Virginia expects to find an Applause opening Morel knocks down the Baseline jumper to put the wol pack back on top Morel had 25 against Louisville and earlier in the year he hes a Virginia transfer mhm two years in Charlottesville third year in Applause Raleigh so when they run their stuff Morel knows what theyre running ooh o reach in foul to take us to the under eight media timeout the KY Mo cell bucket putting the wolf pack back on top casy Music Marcel got a little bit of the ball up top get a piece of the basketball you know what there a you probably cant say that enough the way Virginia tries to wear you down you got to stay locked in you got to assume youre playing 30 seconds of Defense every time because you are and thats where Virginia gets you is at the end of a possession you let up just a bit and youre giv up a layup or an open three pakmans having a great night for Virginia 14 points and seven assists Middlebrooks leading NC State in scoring with 12 hes also got five rebounds and a couple of block shots and NC State to poster Kevin kes Point their defense has been good I mean theyve held Virginia to 36 from the floor theyve blocked seven shots in this game and they lead by two with s and a half to go in a spot in the championship game on the line dun will hoist a three got metal Applause Brooks Miner doing some good work on the offensive glass for the Cavs Kevin Keats not a fan of the call 15 foul on NC Applause State Miner hands it right back to beakman McNeely gets open and knocks it down just faded off that screen a little bit to set his feet it doesnt take him long he does such a good job of going from a cut to shot preparation to the shot his third three of the game Virginia fans have gotten a lot noisier ever since that ball went in diara turns the Cor Corner the force no good and it belongs to the whoos good defense by Ryan dun hes so long 7ot Wings span athletic can really move his Applause feet as noisy as this buildings been in a Applause while again using a lot of time and again McNeely knocks it down well his movement has been so impressive iive the last couple possessions Isaac mcney with backto back buckets to give Virginia a threepoint lead mcney is the one that can really hurt you see him on the left side of the floor just Fades off for that open three then curling right into his shot beautiful form and drills it CS thats 6 Eastern tomorrow night on ESPN thats right in front of our game the Tar Heels against the winner of this one at 830 after seeing a couple shots go down this is ratcheting up the Virginia Defense tough turnaround by Morel wow NC State needed that one Morel hit a short one a few possessions ago and that was not an easy shot but NC State needed that to go Applause in heres the fade wide open tane Murray why does it work so well that fade screen possession after possession because youre playing helps side defense all of a sudden you get hit with a weak side screen and then the ball goes from the right side to the left Virginia by four morcel rebound Applause Music Applause mcney this is where Virginia you can watch them get a little slip or drop it off to the big guy because youre worried about Cutters Murray tipped into the hands of Taylor under five to Applause go horn for three and beakman rips down the rebound for Virginia NC stj now two for 15 from threepoint range big difference in this game Virginia seven for 19 and I think youd agree the quality of the threepointer looks has been significantly higher for Virginia tonight its so hard to get good looks wow McNeely again with the clock going down over the outstretched arm of Ben Middlebrooks largest lead of the Music game Bo Virginia running that moover blocker offense to Perfection over the last three possessions the fade screen now watch Murray up top hes going to get that screen from Miner wide open off that pass from Rees beakman and then with the shot clock going down Isaac mcne Im not even sure he could see the basket over middle Brooks 10 assists for ree Miss Tony Bennett loving the way this ones going right now and NC State and this one has changed a lot in the last couple of minutes thanks to number 11 in white Isaac McNeely bad ankle and all who is now up to 18 points four of six from threepoint range going into DJ Burns McNeely digging down Bo Miner given as good as he gets and burns scores hes got such a tough soft touch for being such a big strong guy hes part Force part finesse and he won that one to make it a fivepoint game but again remember in a Virginia game how quickly that clock runs because they use so much time every time down the floor oconnell trying to have to stick with mcne Miner got it off couldnt hit it and then somehow got it back but its out of bounds to NC State boy the wol pack a little fortunate there minor almost picked it up and laid it Applause in NC State really needs a score here theyve worked so hard defensively and as always Burns gets a touch Music knocked out of bounds by miner says Roger AES re Speakman is saying can you review it but you cant do that until its two minutes or under so itll be Wolfpack Applause ball Burns again and its a threo game I still like the strategy of Tony Bennett tonight not send the double make him make a tough one it takes time off the clock and now theres going to be more time going off the clock while Virginia takes its time to run offense theyre going to start it with a little stagger thats ball screen Dean accelerates blocked from behind by Taylor Virginia ball with six on the shot Applause clock I know McNeely got a watch but Ryan dun there he Applause is Isaac McNeely taken over here in the second half hes got 20 its too easy boy hes been spectacular in this second half and Taylor stepped out of Applause bounds Virginia with the ball and a fivepoint lead and a chance to work in under two minutes nearly stolen by Applause Morel well Virginia gets a score here a comeback is going to be awfully difficult starting with Ney in the middle of the lane but a ball screen hell replace up top dun lost it Morel oh jams it they didnt want to give Ryan Dunn a chance to block it so he removed all doubt what a huge play for NC State and its down to three with a minute 40 to Applause go McNeely defended by oconnell T to shoot beepin Baseline and he Jabs it what a Play What a Night for re pakman and a steal by beakman and hes fouled Tony Bennett asking for a flagrant one because he was just grabbed there that wasnt a play on the ball and they are going to have a look at it what a move by Reese bigman and a strong move to the basket to answer that moreel dunk and then he comes up with a steel on the other end and that is not a play on the Applause ball obviously huge if its called to flagrant one its two and the Applause ball and just a minute 10 remaining in this game Virginia up by Applause five you know weve talked about the wol pack J play in their fourth game in as many nights I dont I know about you I havent noticed fatigue I dont think thats been the issue in the game I think Virginia just in the last few minutes theyve executed so beautifully at the offensive end and maybe there is some fatigue for state of the defensive end in that regard but theyve just done such a good job getting McNeely open for clean looks its been possession fatigue I would call it you know you get tired of chasing these guys around for 25 seconds and maybe make a mistake let up just a little bit when you cant you know t Murray got open on one of those Isaac mcney on a couple its been upgraded to a flagrant one so a couple of free throws and then possession for Virginia and that could be lights out for the warp would have been difficult even had it just been called a common foul but Kevin Keats leading his about something and Tony Bennett is in there two officials and both coaches listening in Petes Applause frustrated and REE Bean walking to the free throw line 16 points and for the second night in roj beakman has tied his career high with 11 Applause assists not sure theres a player in the conference let alone the country that carries as big a load as re Speakman carries for this Virginia Applause team missed them both interesting hes 75 McNeils 87 oh but not a technical the play with so he had to right so yeah foul committed on him but it a still Virginia ball Murray has returned for Virginia Dunn is going to sit you know with Virginia being such a poor foul shooting team NC State might want to play the foul game Applause Music here not the guy you want to foul no out of bounds still Virginia ball 13 on the shot clock 54 seconds on the game clock if Andrew Roy catches the ball you might want to drill him beakman gets fouled and hell go right back to the free throw line one and one for reesman here for UA is Applause done back in now for Virginia free throw blockouts really important here for NC Applause State this time beakman knocks it down nailing the front end Applause one of two Middlebrooks the rebound sixpoint Applause game morcel and he got fouled and will shoot three just not a good foul by a great defender in Ryan dun stopping the clock and sending an 80 free throw shooter to the line in Casey morcel trying to get late pressure on just ticked his arm as he was going up clear foul so the former Virginia Cavalier at the line for three Applause ROV and roie now take the place of Miller and Dunn for Virginia same five for NC State Applause remember Virginia still has three fouls to give so they dont have to give up anything easy defenc state gets the ball back made them all and made it a onep possession game here comes diara back for the Wolfpack well thats gutsy for Casey morcel to drill those three free Applause throws want to get the hands in the ball into the hands of re Speakman first and then Isaac Applause mcney they get it to Applause mcney 13 seconds separating the game clock and the shot Music clock beakman on the drive Ro in the corner missed it morels got it shot clock turned off time out Kevin Keats and NC State boy and when that flagrant foul was CAU it felt like it was basically game over and it is anything but right now very well could have been but re Speakman missed them both lets take a look at tonights Dynamic play of the game brought to you by tro price Isaac mcne in the second half coming off screens ready to fire he has had an outstanding game and an outstanding second half this was the dagger as the shot clock was going down and then coming off the screen on out of bounds underneath getting that Jumper in the corner but right now for Virginia its about defense take away the three for CTI State inside that line and remember Virginia has fouls to give here so they dont have to give up anything easy if somebody gets away you dont want to grab them but you can foul them but if youre NC State are you just looking for the the best quick shot you can get right now if you can get a quick two I take it absolutely 16 seconds can go quickly they can last an eternity as well Music beakman McNeely dun Murray and it looks like Groves going to be on the floor for Music Virginia although the fifth player is in doubt right now now here comes gross OK Connell to inbound hes out there with Taylor Applause Morel and now after seeing what saw Tony Bennett will use a timeout theara and Horn were out there as Music well and I you if Im Tony Bennett Im using these three fouls to give to drain this clock just as NC State gets into into something if theres any sort of ball screen action hedge out and hit somebody just get them before they get in the make them inbounded again AB yeah absolutely you dont want to foul in any way any sort of shooter this is kind of typical of the Virginia wins this year a lot of them have been very very close they have played in these kinds of situations on a number of Applause occasions ell to windbound and its important to watch oconnell as the inbounder as he comes back in you cant just turn your head and let him shoot by you for an open shot and Kevin Keats made a sub he took diara out Burns is back in now after that second time out porn cant get the shot off Morel gets it off cant hit it McNeils got it and they foul him well that is certainly not the shot that Kevin Keats wanted out of that timeout but anytime they defended DJ horn very well in that left corner took the shot away re Bea came over there with a high hand and thats too big of a Applause crowd mcney 87 free throw shooter on the season but this is one and one and he missed it 4 seconds oconnell gets it off Michael okono banks in a prayer to send this game to overtime night they didnt know it was going to be four and a half but theyve got to be so energized right now and away we go that oconnell three was just the third three of the game for MC State the least likely to have gone down and it did in 17 tries Murray open rebound Applause done you have to be really mindful not to overh help on Murray or mcne Morel trying to make it tough on him McNeely doesnt matter the way hes shooting the ball right now wow that was good time his fifth three hes got 23 points Burns somehow hits again his touch is amazing 14 now for DJ Burns Virginia by one when Miner is just picking off oconnell every time he comes around him tried to do it to Horn now Isaac mcney doesnt need much space at all this gave a little hesitation step back and just too difficult for Casey morcel to put the brakes on and then recover to him okon on mcne at the moment beakman the kick done for three from the corner burns the rebound well thats a shot that NC State doesnt mind giving up you can help off Ryan Applause dun G steps out to get a touch usually down on the Block OK Connell back to him in traffic he lays it in and the Wolf Pack leades burds just set that screen and just rolled right down into the middle of the lane hes going to stop that backto back buckets for burns good close out by okell first lead in over 8 minutes for the wol pack oh it didnt last long thats what Ryan dun can do as well as anybody talk about Above the Rim my goodness Music back to Burns he wants a whistle feeling hes getting pushed by miner spins hits again theyre not going to count it foul before the basket which one this is pretty good theater right here isnt it Applause that is a big time finish by Ryan dun my goodness so foul before the shot and Virginia still with fouls to give a block from behind laid in by diara and state back on top horn through three Defenders to block that shot opened up the offensive class for diara fourth game in four nights for the wolf pack as they try to pull off another win here this time in overtime against Applause Virginia good job by Morel better job by dun got free of diara and the Cavs are back on top well diara went for the steel and took himself out of the play again Burns looking at the official again feeling there should have been a call that ones going to count he is something Applause else that is like guarding a tank good grief what a move and you know the tank wants to get to his left hand but that time he tricked him and spun back to his right what an overtime for DJ Burns NC state has to stick to tane Murray and Isaac mcney Here Comes Murray Here Comes Applause beakman 10 to shoot five to shoot beakman forces it up and it belongs to the wolf pack Bo what a great job by Casey Morel got some help from DJ Burns to get back in front and really challenge that shot one minute remaining in overtime and guess who good pass diara no diars got it back shot clock didnt reset OK conell on a great feed from horn time out Tony Bennett with the wolf pack now up by four well DJ Burns is just making play after play plays for himself and then plays for others and on a broken play Michael oconnell who who got NC State to overtime finds himself wide open underneath what a response by NC State how Grim did it look toward the end of regulation right at the when that flagrant foul was caught it looked like it was lights out for MC Music State a Miss free throw by Isaac mcney and as time is running out the transfer from Stanford who is having a great tournament makes a miracle shot from right in front of the M MC State bench just kisses it off the glass and Tony Bennett shoulder slumped cant believe it if Im not mistaken it was a fivepoint lead I believe for Virginia when the flagrant was called and beakman missed the two free throws and there wasnt there was a minute and change left there wasnt a whole lot left and boy all the credit in the world to NC State when Burns gets a touch so many things happen he might try to score he might dish but bodies are flying everybodys trying to get the ball out of his hands and it just disrupts even a great defensive team like Virginia well and there theres been no double team coming to him it was a decision that Tony bendon sta they wanted to go oneonone in the post they usually come to double but because Burns is such a good passer didnt want to take the risk of opening up from three and they held the they held uh excuse me NC State they held like two of 17 from three during regulation up until oconnell hit that right that three to tie it up but DJ Burns has been a man among men in this overtime period and its all come off that right block getting the foul and still completing the play with that left hand off the Music Applause glass hes got 19 in the game seven of them have come in overtime I dont know that you can ask Jordan Miner to do much more than hes done I mean hes you know giv hes given everything that he can give he is out of the game right now Jake Groves has come back in groves is in to shoot it this is about offense right now for Virginia they dont have to have a three here but they have to get something relatively quickly which is not their MO normally not their Style no Groves 48 from three Murray can shoot obviously mcney can shoot Groves no balls loose and out of bounds to Virginia is the call they will have a look at the monitor with 265 seconds seconds to Music go look like middle Brooks got a hand on it first little but from behind him that was Ryan Dunns hand is how are they going to view this like look watch Ryan Dunns right hand yeah but call on the floor is Virginia ball wow is that enough I mean it looked looked to me on the replay like d hit it but is that enough is that conclusive evidence you whose finger touched at last sometimes one player hits it but hits it off the finger of another player out of bounds and just so tough to tell even in slow motion yeah it seems like Virginia is going to wind up keeping this I I dont think you can say thats conclusive video evidence Applause but I think NC state has to think about defense here if they wind up getting the ball great but think more about sticking with Isaac mcne and protecting the middle it is Virginia bow the call stands and theyll inbound with 265 to go the game 68 seconds and now they put 310 of a second back on the clock 268 you have to expect that everybody from Virginia is going to be going after the glass as well oconnell to the deck Corner three no for McNeely and now a foul that is just the sixth team foul committed by Virginia so in overtime here theyre not even in the one and one yet and state will inbound yard inbound you want to try to get it Michael oconnell if you can Casey morcel also an 80 free throw shooter but inbounding is his number one deal into horn and hes quickly fouled and now he will head to the line Virginia fans no doubt in disbelief but the way the last minute and a half or so of Regulation went the missed free throws and then the semi miraculous banked in three by Michael okell I would remove the semi from that give the guy a miracle Round Up Round Up thats Applause fair one and one on a night where horn has now scored five and Jaden Taylor has scored two two big time scores for them they have gotten unbelievable numbers out of their two big guys Burns and Middlebrooks theyve combined for 31 points in this game and NC State is now up by six no fouls no threes for NC State rowes for three Di has got it off to Horn another foul and what an improbable turn of events here in Washington absolutely incredible incredible DJ Burns said it last night quote were not ready to leave just yet look like they maybe weren going to have a choice but now now it looks like theyre going to take on Carolina tomorrow night this is reminiscent of the cardiac pack when Jim valano played the foul game back in 1983 and for those maybe not familiar with State situation dont watch a lot of the ACC NC State is as far as anybody what anybody can tell not under consideration for an at large but they will be alive heading into tomorrow night and if they win tomorrow its a championship and its an automatic Applause bit mcney game over their fourth win in four days and Kevin Keats and the Wolf Packer headed to the championship game to take on the Tar Heels Mr bis
