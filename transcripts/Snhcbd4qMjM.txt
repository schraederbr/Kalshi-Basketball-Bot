illness or maybe its something they want some energy or oh who knows maybe hes late for a team meal things happen but uh you can bet better believe that hes going to be a factor and he has been Wake Forest in white and we are underway the Demon Deacons start with the ball Wake Forest crushed Boston College in Chestnut Hill in the first meeting back in January 8563 whats the recipe for them to do it again well theyve got to continue to do a good job defensively they really uh I thought jumped out on them its important if youre BC you you have to handle uh yourself defensively make your pressure a factor in the game Millions sent right to the rim and appropriate the senior on senior night opens the score well thats what you have to do if youre Wake Forest you know youre going to get pressure so lets take a look but I think its going to be a challenge for BC theyre gonna have to play in senior night thats always a challenge and see if they can get themselves ready to go and regroup this game Boston College starting five TJ picker staff starting instead of Twisted posts a big surprise to us Applause rattles in and out no good take a look at the demon defense starting five Williamson and Appleby the backcourt two guys with their final home game at least in the regular season Wake Forest could potentially host here if they make the NIT of course Demon Deacons fans hoping that they can capture that magic that Virginia Tech did a year ago and shock people in Greensboro next week Appleby shot clock winding down hoist It Off the Mark DC ball well this is the time of year Jay that if youre playing good basketball as I said get into the tournament with some momentum if you can do that you can make a run and you give your team a chance theres so many good teams in this league and if they can put something together now they can definitely take that to their advantage Applause Boston six days ago recorded undoubtedly their best win of the Season 6348 against Virginia then they had a buy over the weekend as a coach you want to ride that momentum you want to keep playing you dont want six days off now for a big win like that right not at all you got that right I hated that as a coach lets play get up lets go step back Williamson doesnt drop Earl Grant told us to shoot around today thought defense was key in that win against Virginia holding the Cavaliers to 48 they can continue that in the final two games of the season they can go to Greensboro and say hey we can beat anybody the way were defending right now hard foul The Freshman Bobby Clinton on the receiving end of it look you know youre right Jay I think whats important is is well talk about in a second well talk about possessions but look at the hands of Tyree Appleby hes really got the ability to get in there lead his team in transition something that coach Grant is concerned about hes got to get his team back and get his defense set well we talked about possessions if youre BC you want limited possessions if youre Wake Forest you want as many possessions as you can 82 possessions is the number they try to strive for if youre if youre BC in many 60s thats thats usually a good number for success two and a half minutes in and Boston College still scoreless playing without Clinton post at least to start this game inside a league Bay hes sworn by three Demon Deacons itll stay PC ball underneath their own hoop interesting theyre still not afraid to post up guys but in this case theyre using their guards to get interior positions Zachary crew traffic thats a tough take from Jade and Zachary much needed for the Eagles well its important that they get on the board they dont want to find themselves digging the hole you dont want to get behind on the road and get behind like they did in their last game got it just points and assists hard to pass the ball to yourself but he finds a way to score and he makes his teammates better a year ago we were talking about Will alondis Williams be the first ACC player to lead the conference who points and assists he won conference player of the year now Appleby may actually do it foreign Applause Music Applause ERS table good to see him ready to check in for Boston College and they need him his offense lacking flow to start the game we talk about how important he is and how good hes been in this last month of February and the January Appleby always the initiator this time passing Whitman hey s it backtoback praise for Wake Forest and UCF will be celebrating not many players to take celebrating his assist its great to have a guy on the team that makes you better Coach you just asked how does he lead the conference and points and assistant he just showed you on backtoback possessions and he knows where to get the ball to thats for sure six nothing Demon Deacons run Applebee Applause and no timeout here were going to wait for the TV timeout I hope in many cases as a coach you kind of gamble on that eight nothing Demon Deacons run over the last 90 seconds Zachary spawn his way into a foul the first five minutes dominated by the Demon Deacons Tyree Appleby doing Tyree Appleby things as the progressivecom Steve Forbes celebrating all three seniors pregame its senior night here in WinstonSalem Davion Williamson has spent the last five years with Forbes two at East Tennessee State the last three here at Wake Forest theres Quinton post it took five minutes but Boston Colleges best player into the game finally coach we were told at the break that hes been Limited in practice the last two days due to an illness so didnt get the start but is in there now but its important you not only you know do you want posting because of how well hes playing but youre talking about a very young team coach Grant talked about having sophomores and freshmen uh and so you want a senior in the lineup and thats what Clinton post can do to give you experience well you see the numbers with him in the lineup compared to without him and he makes a huge difference to this Boston College team and if you needed an example of that in the first five minutes youre outscored 122 and you got buckets in the paper thats just not going to happen Williamson fouled we were just talking about Davey and Williamson honored before the game as part of the Senior Day celebration Steve Forbes said hes the only player in his entire coaching career that he spent five entire Seasons with the first two at East Tennessee State and then hes a WinstonSalem native he transfers with Forbes when he takes the Wake forth back home and what a special three years playing in the ACC its been for that young man that doesnt happen very often so you know coach Forbes is excited about it and Im just about to talk about how well he shoots free throws of course and knocks one down but you know its special when you have a senior somebody thats been with you and can now play and complete things for your team and the extension of you thats huge part of a team at East Tennessee State that won 30 games and then come through to Wake Forest where theyre at the time at the bottom of the ACC and really helped set that Foundation that culture inside the post in an easy two thats what Boston College has been missing Jay that was easy and they have not had anything easy post gets in the game he scores immediately Music stole it away to Zachary one on two and it doesnt matter back to back skits for Boston College theyre right back in it look at the confidence level of BC when post is in the game a completely different team Music Applause heres cam hildren he had 20 in the first meeting against Boston College that off the hands of Andrews car you can see what happens when theres a turnover youre youre Boston College you can do this you are good in transition coach Forks knows that its one of his concerns going into this game the Eagles outscoring the Demon Deacons six to one since winter post got in the game Applause its crazy that one player has that much of an effect on this team and they are playing totally different with Clinton post on the floor CJ Pena hammers at home just like that weve got a one possession game just getting started at the ACC since hes been inserted the Eagles on an 81 run how does he make such a big difference coach I alluded to this Jay experience breeds confidence you play with a guy thats got experience he also breeds confidence when youre seven foot tall so nice to have a guy that size it makes things a lot easier and its not just this game when he missed time in nonconference Boston College really struggled nice pocket out of the timeout by Cameron Hilda well shoot thats by the way a good timeout by Steve Forbes you see that after a timeout to come back and score you want to do that but Boston College plays at a different level with Clinton Post in the game post with it Applause Pena the blow by backtoback baskets for CJ Pena you know Jay the whole team just seems to play with extra hop in their step and thats something that you can get from your senior that gives you that ability of confidence you really just are familiar All Things Come Together swatted Away by Pena almost saved by Prince the league back Pena giving some big time minutes off the bench for this Eagles team heres a look and not a very good look because a challenge and a block and not only do you have the ability to challenge shots if youre BC you can affect shots just as important Applause Music Applebee decides to take it this time doesnt make it PC has made their last four shots starting to heat up on the road Applause dumped inside post one on one with Carr righty hook oh he makes it look so easy well Im surprised they didnt double team coach Forbes talk about getting it out of his hands making a little more difficult and they will employ the double team as this game goes on they cannot afford to play quitting post man on Main five straight makes for Boston College theyve trailed by 10 early car wide open Way Off the Mark risky pass a league Bay turns it over Wake Forest has it up ahead to Hildreth he misses the Finish gets his own rebound going on three eagles decides to smartly pass it out and reset thats great huzzle it does not come away with the shot but he gets the ball back next to possession for his team shot clock under 10 Hildreth you know he wants to ultimately convert and he cant do it Applause Boston College has made five in a row Wake Forest has missed their last five Eagles trailed by 10 122 now looking for the lead Applause hosts trying to muscle his way in and an offensive fouls call well obviously thats a good time you want to get in there get some help down their posts tough doesnt like what hes got you got to stay with it the time coach its the best time of the year I love it I cant tell you about my memories Jay playing in the tournament what a treat for your fans your alumni your players its something theyll remember the rest of their lives very similar to last year it feels wide open we see Virginia Tech pull off four wins in four days to earn their way into the NCAA tournament these are two teams trying to capture the same magic in Greensboro next week so anything can happen thats why you want to save your best basketball play the best basketball is a year at the end of the year Applause well those are two scores now they Bridge they drew up their best plays maybe but they really needed that basket to extend this ugly the sophomore Marsh so were talking about the ACC tournament this is what it would look like if it started today Wake Forest and eight Boston College attempt I think you can see these matchups are interesting but if youre playing good basketball going into the tournament thats what counts you want to continue to keep your head up and just really perform because you can make an advancement you can get there as a coach whats the number one thing you want going in the champion I like to be rested Jay man whatever it takes get fresh legs you cant go in there fatigue if youre fatigued youre going to struggle shot clock down to three post has to hurry fading away that pitch short I think most to get that one over looks like to go to the basket they scored now BC 12 with their 14 points have been in the paint they need to go back inside Lucas Taylor came off the bench and hit two big threes over the weekend against Notre Dame misses that triple oh thought about it from the logo Applause the marsh didnt drop foul called against Andrew Carr on the rebound Steve Forbes not happy about it but you can see the ball gets deep he was able to get by it wasnt a real clean box out I think the official cut of little body kind of thing Steve Ford said hey we can let that one bro lets lets let the fans enjoy this one Ill tell you when youre a coach Jay youre on the sideline you never see the game objective its always subjective trust me on that you want the call to go your way and you fight for your team Steve Forbes always lets you know how hes feeling absolutely count on that factory weaving through traffic rejected by Marsh Bickerstaff had no angle hildred has it but settles for a jump ball possession arrow with Boston College now youre talking about Steve Forbes and what the job hes done hes been a winner at every level Jay hes just continued to succeed and you know we talked at length today earlier and he really is enjoying this this challenge hes got it for his his teams compete wherever hes been as a coach his teams compete hes the ACC coach of the year last year on a team that if not for Boston College pulling the upset in the ACC tournament could very well and went to the NCAA tournament got upset by The Eagles back in Brooklyn a year ago by Earl Grant it was his first year as head coach of Boston College and they went to Brooklyn totally underseen and they upset Wake Forest ruined the demon Deacon season and they took Miami the next day to overtime should have won that game so he knows his team is capable of the postseason Appleby wants it and he gets it five seconds to shoot Appleby trying to turn nothing into something Way Off the Mark shock my violation great job by BC they got the shot clock down very difficult to score on a short clock and thats what BC wants to do they want shorter possessions they dont want our longer possessions they dont want to have to be uh playing in a quick Helter Skelter game they definitely want to play in a slower pace and Wake Forest for struggling right now one of their last eight for Boston College can capitalize they missed five in a row Applause Music Zachary hands It Off now back to him kick out a three Matson cant connect stickers that tracks it down Second Chance opportunity Zachary he cashes in from three Jaden Zachary ties it at 17 now Boston College is really feeling I think confident thats a key word its Wake Forest its average 77 points this year theyre struggling to put points on the board foreign Applause Music thats where you want to spot up at an open floor the corners are always wide open Applause Zachary packing down Applebee Jade and Zachary he has five points in the last minute for Boston College and thats tough to do against Tyree Appleton well it is but you know Boston College not afraid to post their guards I like their uh you know their format of going inside and and trying to get to the foul line and trying to get some easy looks Factory with 11 of the Eagles 19 now if you march good move no finish Applause thats it for BCs first lead and he gives it to him a big time three from Mason Matson fires the Eagles in front for the first time tonight theyre feeling it Jay once you let a team get on a run its hard to slow him down Taylor in trouble too much on it remember BC Trail 122 now its all Eagles looking for more two bounces but doesnt fall for Devin McLaughlin Applebees Applause you first for the second time tonight look at this gracious you gotta love to play with the diary Appleseed get to the basket hell find you he knows his teammates he knows how to set them up to Market them okay all tied at 22 back and forth game really fun one in his first half Music and you can see that Boston College likes the three they get open they knock it down theyre extending thats important but obviously its Appleby over the top to this big fella count it freaking you got to believe Jayden Tyree Appleby has used him for inspiration what I love is cp3s got the stat sheet over on the sideline Ill give it these guys some tips hes got to get to him about defense right now Chris Paul is uh you know when youre a point guard Jay you understand the game and Chris Paul understands the game you dont go through Chris Paul Jason Kidd these guys are cut out and could be and could be and will be coaches before their careers are over you think hed make a great coach I sure do I absolutely do I dont think thats an unpopular opinion so BC back on top after they trailed by 10 earlier this half Williamson fading away thats the second shot clock violation Boston College has really clamped down defensively well I think thats been a big key to this game theyve taken wake down the last seconds of the shot clock and again Jay wakes used to scoring 77 in the game thats one of the tops in the country but get Boston College credit theyre defending theyre out there really defending Cuts theyre clogging up the lane theyve done an excellent job yo its funny coach before the game we were talking about how senior night can go two ways either use that energy positively and certainly Wake Forest down at the start of the game but sometimes you can play with a little too much emotion on a night left Ive been on both ends but Jay Ive had players starting a game with tears in their eyes so you know you talk about emotion it takes maybe a couple of minutes maybe even a half to get over it because your emotions are running high so a lot of teams do senior night after the game or after the game you follow anybody theyre the two seniors starting Williamson and Appleby have combined for just three of eight heres Hildreth give and go Taylor wide open from three and he buries him Lucas Taylor fireswitch Forest back in front that is vintage Wake Forest when you see the ball moving like that four or five guys touching the ball and now they get an open shot they they can knock down those shots Great Balls Music offensive foul human deacons ball coming up next over on ESPN we will take you through Allen field houses Lawrence Jalen Wilson at number three Jayhawks taking on Texas Tech thats nine oclock Eastern time over on ESPN as super Tuesday presented by Progressive continues Music fiery Appleby Off the Bench so its Lucas Taylor Damien Williamson in the backcourt and Taylor air balls the floater Applause Music Stripped Away in Wake Forest capitalize Clinton from the corner way too much on it weve seen four or five air balls in this first half from Wake Forest straight Applause Music lindman trying his luck again this time he hits iron but still cant connect and again Jay this is a team thats shooting 37 with his 38 from the threepoint line so they put off their Mark the sluggish start to the demon defense four of 13 for three a team thats led by 10 that lead down to one with under three left in the first half Music Memoirs to civil rights activists that resulted in her receiving the presidential medal of freedom you can stream black history always on ESPN plus all year long stoop to the hoop doesnt drop for PC would have given the Eagles the lead Hillcrest Coast to Coast almost it and one Music both teams getting it halfway down but not falling I think Jay when you talk about Wake Forest theyve got to handle I think you gotta you know you gotta handle the physicality they play physically and they pressure you so its not a bad idea if your Wake Forest take the ball of the rim you have to beat pressure continues the struggle this is that free throw only two points for him today he had 20 in the first meeting back in Chestnut Hill in January big reason why Wake Forest won that game and he is struggling tonight so far in this first half what stood out to you well I like the bench Boston College has scored over half their points Off the Bench very important to do this on the road your pension comes up back and gives you energy great pass but no finish backtoback missed layups for Boston College Zachary makes up for it though the steal and hes foul yeah you said that Jay and thats what you do when you make a mistake you miss a bunny you can come back and you find a way to get your team to the line great second effort and keeping your head ready I love watching Jade and Zachary play every single possession he gives it everything hes got a stellar freshman year last year unknown coming out of the junior college ranks and proving that he is an ACC caliber player so hes the blue collar but this old Boston college students move College theyre not afraid to mix it up youre going to see some bruises some bumps maybe a little blood but theyve got to use their scrappiness against a team that really likes to put points in the board they can get out and go a challenge to play Wake Forest but if youre going to play them play aggressively and with that made free throw Zachary has accounted for half of Boston College is scoring hes got 13 of the Eagles 26 Kyrie app will be back in the game for the demon defense has not scored since the 15minute mark leaves the ACC in scoring only five points to his name tonight theyre doubling him out after every ball stand has it here trying to find some magic at the end of the shot clock step back three no good Zachary with a head of steam lost the handle it bounced off Bobby Clinton so well stay with BC Applause Music I like the aggressiveness both teams trying to get to the rim again getting the foul lines a key gotta Come Away I think but emptyhanded Applause post this is the bunny Boston College has missed a lot of good looks inside that kills you as a coach right you as your coach youre going to bring that up and have fun trust me girlfriend well say guys we missed Five Point Blank layups thats ten points Mildred hard foul hell head to the line for two but Jay thats what wakes got to do you know youve got an angle of the basket get to the basket and get to the foul line thank you neither team has made a field goal in the last three minutes they both missed four in a row until Saturday and absolutely loaded day on ESPN Kansas Texas for Eastern Time and then Duke and North Carolina strange to Nazi numbers next to those two schools days thats at 6 30 and then Arizona UCLA another top 10 matchup The nightcap 10 Eastern Time a Sonic Blockbuster Saturday Applause Applause well everybody counted them out a year ago and they both ended up in the final four Applause so its funny narrative all season long is the accs having it down here Ive been privileged to call this conference all year I test tells you that once again theyre going to have teams get in and make deep runs just like they did a year ago when the narrative was similar no Applause Music Ashley gave it away one minute left in his first half will be he has swarmed every time he touches the ball two men on the ball Jake youve got to put guys on him much needed for Wake Forest Lake Forest very fortunate to come back and grab this lead its been Boston College as you mentioned whos missed police to three things off no good and now the demon deak has been hold for the final shot of this first half on an 82 run Applause or you mentioned double teams keep your eye if the ball gets back in Appletons hands they will definitely put you on the ball Williamson calls his own number again delivers lead into halftime really fun back and forth game of the ACC pulled me during halftime you expect a different second half well a couple reasons I think both teams are going to relax I think both teams missing layups tight and senior night always has an effect on how you play I I really believe that so look look to see both teams kind of loosen up in this second half four starts with the ball leading by six Clinton huge mismatch and he cant take advantage offensive foul credit Makai Ashton Langford he was giving up seven inches in that mismatching draws the charge Jay watch a feet feet never stop moving youll continue to move your feet youre in position you take the charge great job again BC playing defense if youre Earl Grant thats the last thing you want to see continue in this game leaving 12 points on the board well the good news is youre getting there bad news is you got to convert what can you do as a coach to fix missed layouts now you got to relax you got to concentrate and youve got to understand stolen away Makai Ashton Langford all the way to the rim and that time the layup is converted against Jay off the defense its Boston College is putting together a great defensive performance making it difficult or wait to get good looks in the basket and their double teaming Masterpiece first Eagles field goal since the fiveminute Mark of the first half no its interesting you got wake with a fourpoint lead but I know through Steve Forbes youre saying you know you just dont feel comfortable youre not playing the way you want to play but a lot of that has to do with your opponents BC now is playing better basketball theyve got their guys back theyre healthier now Applebee for three Applause to start the second hes had more success when hes gone Hano and mono you bring another offensive player to win the set screens its been difficult but oneonone is hard to stop him hes trying to shake that right hand but he fell on Applause PC answers for the big three these two teams gone punch for punch that right hook from France yeah just now we got to kill ourselves a game I I did think this would be a little bit different uh complexion in the second half and so far were getting that defensively dominated first half now the shooting starting to show up Appleby from the same spot this time misses bounces out Williamson tries his luck he cant knock it down maybe third times the charm for Wake Forest Williamson scoots in and finishes three times as a tournament if your BC you can yell afford to give white for his tap outs and offensive putbacks and and reloads and they did theyve got three extra opportunities heres post backing down march Lefty hook rolls around but does not drop yeah theyve done everything but you could nail those shots thats as close as you can get to the basket and not convert just one of those nights for Earl Grants team well again you know if you Wake Forest are you going to do a good job that youre aggressive you go to the basket and theyve got guys that can really defend BC knows that theyve got to get some guys to close up Lane and pour some outside shots they did they done a really good job of challenging Shots tonight Applause Music Carr lines up in three well theres that guy again Appleby with the assist and if youre open youve got to be ready because Tyree Applebee will get to the bridge again four assists on tonight for Appleby an immediate answer count it plus the foul Makai Ashton Langford thats a good look taking the ball to the basket I really like you his ability he puts it down hes got the big belly but he Ducks his head gets to the rim concentrates contact and the foul Boston College has had some success taking it to the rim only four points from The kayasha Langford he averages over 12 you want to drive because he shoots 87 from the line so you get rewarded when youre that type of free throw shooter gets the line as often as you can across the college has only attempted five free throws in this game theyve made all of them Applause Jay I like both teams arent settling from the outside I think you can see a concerted effort that youre trying to establish inside out if you can get to the rim apart of course a double team you can get some open looks a lot of teams and coaches dont do that but I think both coaches are showing their ability to get to the line and get to the rim Music Applause for the first time tonight for Wake Forest freshman out of Highlands Ranch Colorado gets it right into the Freshman Keller and takes advantage how about the left hand he shows you the ability to use either hands but when you let post guys get in that deep Jay those are pretty easy scores so wakes got to try to turn him to the opposite hand and try to get a second Defender there thats just too easy post now with a Zachary 13 so those two the dominant ones for Boston College of this game Carr has a mismatch eight inches over Zachary almost lost his footing thats a tough tank well theyve had some really tough looks and Lawsons made it very hard to get good looks degree of difficulty challenge shots the Eagles have made four of their last five down the lane another and one opportunity sixnothing Run for the Eagles Makai Ashton Langford started to heat up hell try and finish the threepoint lead a year and wow one he was a real big fan he came over was very complimentary he had me over to his house he was very close here the kid well very close to Pete Newell but hes chastised me one time he said Ben you know you never come over and say hi before the game I said coach has a long line there he said oh good I feel better I thought you were beginning to snub me no not the greatest college basketball coach to ever live I I said coach trust me I just was being polite but he was a he was really a gracious gracious man Jay and Im just glad they named that award uh after John would deserves it thats a great story Ben Braun 12 years as the head coach to Cal and the Pac12 wouldnt that be intimidating with John Wooden watching Courtside you coach if I had a coach with Pete Newell watching Courtside so you talk about somebody that John wouldnt look up to John Wooden came down and used to meet with Pete Newell and really adapted his press he got his press from Pete Newell so those two coaches the two greatest coaches that Ive ever been around hell be struggling to get it in hes hit Williamson nice job keeping his feet inbounds like a wide receiver tiptoeing five minutes into this second half one point game in the ACC what a pass Childress went up opportunity goes Baseline everything but the Finish rejected by the round drawn by post great look you know both teams leaving some points at the basket but you got to give the defense credit theyre not making it easy that was a challenge dunk that was a challenge shot and if youre a coach you want to challenge shots you challenge shots up Jay team shoot the average 38 you dont challenge shots they shoot 62 thats a pretty good number to look at and the gauge if youre if youre teaching players both teams shooting 40 percent or better you wonder whats going to separate these two theyve been so close throughout the game Pena fires BC in front their first leads into his 2422 well Ill answer your question I think it stops you know which team can get consecutive stops both teams capable of scoring but you got to find a way to get stops if youre BC youve got to start with Mr Appleby get the ball out of his hands dont let him beat you its a 10nothing Eagles run Keller trying to put a stop to it and hes rejected BC dialed in on defense cant turn it into offense though Music Applause first Miss after making four in a row Clinton in a three he cant connect Keller Scoops up the loose ball second chance for the Demon Deacons and Williamson gives it away Manson hits it Mason Manson and Boston College on a 13nothing run Applause how about BC youre on fire shake the shot the corner the spot up the three weve got a lead PC College this is spectacular day for college hoops the final Saturday in the regular season I love Kansas in Texas I love UCLA Arizona but I got to tell you North Carolina Dukes thats basketballs greatest driver no doubt about it 13nothing run for Boston College Eagles largest lead of the game of four Applebee drops it back you were at Duke practice over the weekend right well you know John Shire a long time recruiter and he got away Jay but uh were still friends uh family friends as well uh what a what a great job hes doing and I actually had North Carolinas game when they beat Virginia on Saturday boy did they play well I thought 13 stepped up so you dont count Duke out or North Carolina to come March those two teams are as familiar with March Madness as any two teams in the country we were talking to the first fact The Narrative of the league in the ACC is its quote unquote down couldnt be farther from the truth if youve watched the games over the course of the season but the coaches in this league feel like if Duke and North Carolina arent ranked it devalues the whole league one I understand that today because sometimes youre a victim of your own success and what do I mean by that is that the ACC has been so successful look at postseason look at the teams and sometimes you take it for granted but believe me theyre alive and well last year it was a similar narrative as post drills the three and yet three teams go to the elite eight so uh that was no fun by the way its the last team you want to see is an ACC team in March Madness Williamson a three they needed an answer and Williamson couldnt deliver see ball the eagles with all the momentum right now they are dominating his second half shooting 73 percent on a 2110 run since halftime wow and Jay if youre Steve Forbes youve got to talk to your team about defense forget the offense youve got to stop a team once they get the momentum find a way make some adjustments and find a way slow them down challenge shots the Eagles have made six of their last seven the post in the post righty hook money look at the confidence level on Quinton post and youre right Jay he gets the ball that close to pass thats money thats Unstoppable uh very difficult to defend when post guys get two people think just lead to the night for Boston College scores totally out of their offensive Rhythm right now its all BC Jay look at post you want a basket no problem Clinton host Pete the dick felon two points in the paint sure than any other year Ive coached on how to progress my team to adversity injuries all these things he said my first year we just try to establish our foundation now I feel like I have to build our our program and hes doing that so you know give Coach Grant credit uh hes been through a lot but hes showed up tonight and hes playing against you know a hungry Wake Forest team that hes playing at a very high level right now offensive execution at a premium BC stays red hot the Eagles now shooting over 75 percent in this second half a 202 run Applause 10 of 13 from the floor remarkable second after Boston College Hildreth trying to punch back he draws Newfound you know Boston College Jay luckily has Amnesia because they forgot the 20point loss they had at home that Wake Forest put on him but that was a different team then theyre playing at a different level now and I think Earl Grants done a good job getting his team to kind of progress and if youre Steve Forbes right now this is a big game this this game has a lot on up at stake pool you know its worth reminding people this is a Boston College team that upset Wake Forest in the second round of last years ACC tournament Earl Grants team was a 13 seed Wake Forest was a fiveseed a loss that very well cost Wake Forest the shot at the NCAA tournament so even though the demon Jenkins have won four straight regular season meetings that ACC tournament loss was a huge one wake would have likely gone dancing and now for a second year in a row Boston College could deliver that knockout blow Zachary oh he is red hot Jade and Zachary 18 points now you mentioned it is now Wake Forest that really needs this win because theyre going to have to make it before maybe just a deep run when the tournament gets them in now theyve got to almost go through if they lose this game and try to get to try to get the victory all the way through yeah no doubt about it did Wake Forest loses this game their only path to the NCAA tournament would be winning in Greensboro and Boston College Eagles dominating biggerstaff soaring counting the goalten six straight makes for Boston College Jay when its all said and done you know look at the defense the defense has allowed Boston College to get back in this game but by the same token when theyve had open up looks and open opportunities theyve got it but look at the defense just pestering its just non you know nonstop Steve Forbes very concerned with Boston College coming in he said look theyre physical they play with a lot of pressure on the ball weve got to handle that pressure in the second half Boston College outscoring Wake Forest 30 to 11 now a 13point lead your season on the line like we just talked about could Boston College deliver another knockdown blow to a a Wake Forest season in backtoback years so demon d kids backs against the wall once before say to his team with 10 minutes left this left well you know theres a lot of basketball left so youve got possessions but youve got to put the ball and Im sure he will put the ball back in Tyree will you know obviously I put these hands because hes the guy that stirs the drink hes the guy that gets his team to play when he plays well his team plays well Steve Forbes made no bones about he said every time we play well its Appleby diary Applebee that causes us to play well just both free throws Wake Forest has missed seven foul shots on the ninth this is uncharacteristic from Wake Forest to the second half Applause of Kyrie thats a heat check from Clifton poster to go back first Miss its seven shots for BC theyve built a 13point lead can they hang on for the final 10 minutes on the road Music Forest calling out for somebody to step up could it be cam Hildreth he misses it Jay they just cant seem to get a good look to the basket because if Boston Colleges pressure theyre doing a great job of closing out on Shooters and closing driving leads its been seven minutes without a made field goal for Wake Forest Boston College continues to build this lead I think Boston College Plays like this now this catching the season I hate to play it into the tournament but theyre playing so well they just beat Virginia six days ago big time Music big time Applebee maybe thats the shot in the arm Wake Forest is needed well theyve got to cut this lead to single digits if they do that they will get back in this game theyve got a great chance but it starts on the defensive end theyve got the defense Ashton Lang first all the way to the rim didnt drop here comes hildred Applause the Old Republic drive he lost the handle didnt get a clean look now he rushed himself Jay I think he could have drawn a foul if he had hidden broad jump but high jump youve got to go up to the test rejected at The Rim can wait for us cash in on the other end everybody two threes for Tyree Appleby its a mini sixnothing run to cut the lead to nine back to single digits here in WinstonSalem foreign take a look at that resume Ben Braun there is no margin for error for this demon Deacons team and yet trailing by nine theyve cut it the single digits this is a must win if they want to give themselves a shot I think youre right Jay and you know if they can come back and win this game they are definitely back in the conversation so theyre only three possessions down theyre putting themselves in position to make a move out of the timeout three comes up short eight minutes left to play Applebees the hot hand on the drive all the way to the river well thats good coaching well you put the ball from Tyree Applebys hands and he knows what to do he can deliver for your team weve got a basketball game Jake Tyree Appleby has scored or assisted on 13 of Weights last 14 points Applause thank you Music foreign Applause gathers it three seconds to shoot shot clock violation and now youve got the crowd back in the game and this can be a lift for Wake Forest you know they played Boston College very good defense and so thats been a surprise because you know theyve stopped Wake Forest now can they stop can Boston College continuing to get the momentum back Damon D gets trailed by 15 theyve just about cut the lead in half Appleby too much on it Wake Forest has got to dig in defensively Steve Ford said look weve improved but weve got to get our defense back and theyve been struggling all night to guard BC Applebees sticking a hand in oh theyre more active now Jay you can see the urgency you know dont think this team and these players dont know this they know this is a big game you know if its not a mustwin game its a pretty turn close to it theyve got to get out there and defend defensively and give themselves opportunities under 10 on the shot clock Boston College clinging to a seven point lead Chaz Cali the floater Falls Big Time bucket by The Freshman Chaz Kelly a good looking freshman Earl Grant so high on the profession from Houston thats a big basket Eagles lead back to nine Appleby almost lost it Zachary all over him Williamson a three and theres Tyree Appleby again Jay knows what to do he gets both feet in the paint you collapse and he finds his teammates knocked down threes time now Boston College the Joel has come to life trying to Spur Wake Forest comeback they buy Progressive continues with Texas Tech at number three Kansas you dont want to miss that nine eastern time after were done here on ESPN and Braun J altered with you Tyree Appleby scored or assisted on 16 of the teams last 17 points he is a oneman comeback machine right now real quiet end of the first half quiet no more Music oh draws the contact count it plus the foul out of the Boston College timeout Winton post delivers well how about this move for the big guy sweep and go he gets to the rim draws contact has a chance for a threepoint play Big basketball and thats four fouls on Andrew Carr post cant convert the threepoint play Lee stands at eight Applause Applebee directing traffic heres the Freshman Bobby Clinton off the car playing with four fouls so he was under 10 on the timer Williamson all the way to the Reds I really like that possession by Wake Forest they gave the ball back to Tyree Appleby with a live dribble you can do a lot more with the basketball than live dribble he found his teammate hes bringing the basket off the freshmans hands thats a turnover well thats by the defense Jay thats Wake Forest now turning it up a notch this defense was nonexistent in my opinion in the first half its now a staple this is whats caused them besides making shots to increase this lead and get this lead back because they play defense theyve defended Boston College theyve stepped up and answered the challenge Applause still a two possession game Boston College now has got to find a way to slow down Tyree after the easier said than done the young man whos got a chance to set an alltime ACC record points an assist no player in the ACC has led to conference at the end of the regular season in those two categories both of them passing off this time Lucas Taylor shot clock down to three Williamson has to heave Way Off the Mark thats a great possession for Boston College they needed to stop desperate you cannot allow Wake Forest to now presently but they get the Stop and Boston College has played good defense now its up to Wake Forest to return the favor waiting to stop Eagles still shooting 65 percent in this second half a 15point lead is down to six trying to add to it and post put it Corrales back to back turnovers I love the defensive activity to the Wake Forest they have their hands on almost every pass getting in the passively deflections huge by Wake Forest Applause and that was a clear out Jay they crossed their wings raised their post guys up the floor and resemble the oneonone in the basket great play call by Steve Forbes Applause has Boston College back up by seven and dont go anywhere yet but BCs now not leaning over theyre not going to lay down and die theyre defending Applebee already with 20 on the night passes up Williamson lines up the three be involved with it but now look if youre if youre Wake Forest youve got to say look Boston College has scored 30 points to Payton are shooting 66 in the second half you have to find a way if you want to claw this game out and defend it this feels like a March Madness game both teams giving everything to this matchup two teams that are desperate for some momentum to take with them to Greensboro they have played like their lives are on the line all night long post on the drive a whistle offensive foul wave off the basket how about the defensive positions this is a great job of anticipating so much a defense anticipating taking the charge willing to give up your body that couldnt be a more important play defensively than what Wake Forest just did to take the charge of the big again Wake Forest utilize grab that momentum with a great defensive play usually you do Damon Greek is trailed by as many as 15 now trying to cut the lead to one possession up top the home fans trying to will Wake Forest to a stop Quentin post has other ideas dumps it down low bicker staff to finish huge play by post to find his teammate EJ bickerstats great job youve got to put a second defender on post to do what does he do finds his teammates heads up under two minutes to go fourpoint game Applebee pulls the trigger cant connect Applause Boston College going to slow things down clinging to a fourpoint lead on the road Appleby commits the foul well youre right Jay youve got time on your behind you again if you can just utilize the clock you do not want to be delivering and you certainly dont want to turn the ball youll take anything right now missed shot but dos no thats a no can do leave it wake again needs a stop close out this comeback no more fouls to give either Jade and Zachary has been the goto guy 18 points tonight for the Eagles has it here under 10 on the shot clock Zachary Applause too much on an offensive rebound though and a kicked ball a fresh shot clock that is a costly offensive rebound well thats a killer you know Jay you play great defense you challenge up really a tough shot for Zachary and all you need to do is seal off and BC Keeps The Possession alive thats a back record each team with one timeout remaining Music Boston College can take this under a minute before they have to shoot Applause Appleby all over Zachary got it away here comes Wake Forest Williamson attorney Applause timeout Boston College the goal is on its feet and Wake Forest who once trailed by 15 in this second half has cut it to one gotta look at this now watch the steal the quick Hands by Appleby and watch this shot I think this shot hit class from the corner it did thats something you dont see very often did he call back I dont think anybody cares does not matter look it does not matter the bank is open here in Wake Forest on senior night the Winston Salem native and what a game a huge three Applause Music crowd as electric theres Chris Paul CP3 hoping his alma mater Wake Forest can pull it out here before he plays tomorrow night with the Suns against the Charlotte Hornets always magic when you can bring one of your your best back home now hes hes gotten a good one so if we what a fun finish this is look how cool common collected is I think he might know something we dont maybe he knows wigs got something in the back here but never know this tough comeback has been unbelievable uh you think about it they were 13 down and things werent going their way but they just managed to hang in there look at what post has done for Boston College but Appleby Williamson would wait they have really stepped up in the second half and you can see now that wakes really been on a tear but its going to come down as I said the defense you want to win this game you better defend Boston College has been on fire they still havent South Boston College yet BC now out of timeouts for the final 45 seconds of Regulation they have the ball and a onepoint lead by as many as 15 now just trying to close out a win on the road seven seconds to shoot Ashton Langford bounced out of bounds with three seconds on the shot clock what do you do here well you have play inside out you dont want post getting the ball Jay you must make if youre if you Wake Forest make Boston couch throw the ball in the perimeter and take your chances with a challenge shot nothing to the basket to post hits him as the buzzer sounded on the shot clock Quentin post delivers Applebees down three all the way a chance to tie it at the line and you want to know if Tyree Appleby is a clutch basketball player he can score he can assist his team needed him there to score he takes it to the basket gets fouled zorbs contact has a chance Jake to tie this game with 19 on the clock 204 tonight from the foul line Applause at 69 well now youre waiting for us and unfortunately youve got to try to play a last possession BC can play for the last possession and the way theyve been playing theyve been on fire thats going to be a big challenge his wake up to it 15 seconds to go Boston College with Avatar now trying to steal one on the road eight seconds left Applause Boston College leads with 22 left Makai Ashton Langford Wake Forest uses its final timeout Music okay how how important is pivoting look at him keep his pivot put down lets the defender clear him and makes the basket with the young players out there watching this watch the pump fake to step through the concentration and the Finish thats just excellent so 22 to go if youre Wake Forest what do you have in your back well youve got to get youve got to try to get it down the length of the floor you dont really have time to dribble it in a EV ho you can but youre probably gonna draw up if your steam Forbes a pass if youre Boston College the one thing you cannot afford to do is file and so Steve Forbes knows that hes telling his team hey guys theyre not going to foul go up and grab with two hands youll get an opportunity because you just cant give up a foul in this situation so as a coach youve got to know that and take advantage of it you would think Tyree Appleby gets the ball in the final shot here on senior night right well you know hes gonna have to come off some hes going to have to come off a screen I think if you give it to him in the backboard thats just not enough time to get a quality shot uh you know youre gonna have to see if he can get something some momentum do you feel bad for the hearts of demon Deacon fans because theyve been in this situation all season long 10 games decided by three points or less here Wake Forest is again been heartbreak but hopefully this one will have a little different ending now only 22 seconds left down to the final shot Applause what a win for Boston College six days ago they beat Virginia and now they come into WinstonSalem and stun Wake Forest on senior night not easy to do Jay but if
