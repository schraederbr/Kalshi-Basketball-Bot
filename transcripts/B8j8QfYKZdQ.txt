score for Georgia Tech first of two meetings this season between the yellow jackets and the Tigers 143rd beating all time a series that dates back to 12 these games have always been closed theyve always been intense its been a fierce rivalry Ron groover Jeffrey Anderson Tommy Morrissey the officials today as Clemson controls the opening tip Georgia Tech into its fun house with trick mirror defense Music PJ home finding Ian shefflin down low Clemsons got Biggs who can really dish the ball and Hall and Tyson as we look at the starting lineup for Georgia Tech a couple of changes Kyle Sturtevant at a season high in point Saturday he gets denied in the starting lineup Tristan Maxwell had a big game as well hes in there well see Davon Smith and Debo Coleman come off the bench I was surprised to see Georgia Tech open with this though normally Josh likes to save him sturdivance from the outside following up that 13point performance against Alabama State Applause one key piece missing thats thats heavenway day to day with plantar fasciitis out today as PJ Hall knocks down the jumper into a Shepherd getting the start in heavenways place who had the first basket for Clemson well against the Zone PJ Hall is really critical theyve gotten the ball twice he scored once in the system the second time they really looked for him to get the ball in the paint against Stone Here Comes Jalen Moore whos been coming into his own of late 13 and a half points over his last six one of the things Georgia Tech likes to do is a lot of dribble handoff a lot of movement so they they can get some penetration in the bank Hunter lined it up instead passes it off for the ball lost it first turnover of the game Brad Brownell alltime winningest coach at Clemson closing in on 400 wins for his career fourway Josh pastner on the sideline for Georgia Tech is the three goals for Miles Kelly 37 from Deep just like on cue Kelly is the guy that can really catch and shoot and hes and hes so versatile because hes also learned to put it on the floor on Sir Tyson rattles in and out all the offensive rebound and goes to work down low EJ Hall does an outstanding job in the post area hes not the most athletic but hes smart he can shoot the ball and extremely skilled Josh pastner likes to say this is a team that doesnt have a star but the star is the team as Rodney Howard crashes to the rim hes coming off a doubledouble over the weekend well one of the things both of these two teams really share the basketball and I think thats the strong point for both of them I think the strength is in the numbers and not necessarily in the individuals Music sixth year grad transfer from BC shot clock is down to 10 driving on Maxwell dumps it off Paul beats the shot clock Paul is the key because he he can catch the ball in the paint and make decisions with him stir spiers Here Comes Hunter hes really adapted to that point guard role this season and able to draw the foul Josh passner now in his seventh season at Georgia Tech and he was telling us over the weekend before the Alabama State game to fire up his team he submerged his head in an ice bucket and he said Hey listen it was crazy but it worked well hes a very emotional guy and his players really enjoy playing for him with this Zone with Georgia Tech tries to do is make you be stagnant and the one thing Clemson has really worked on is moving the ball and not being stagnant they get a lot of flashes in the middle Hunter aligns it up it doesnt go thats something to watch Perry Clemsons the best threepoint shooting team in the ACC Georgia Tech is the best at defending the three and one of the reasons George attack is so good is because they didnt change their defense there you see right there good slip finish to the basket and thats the way that Georgia Tech likes to attack thats Howard hes the big post guy and he gives Georgia Tech a real presence inside and as they get deeper into the ACC theyre going to need that size Applause the foul was on shefflin his first in the mantoman Georgia Tech likes to operate from the elbow Music 30 their offensive rebound and put back by Jalen Moore you dont see too many offensive boards by this Georgia Tech Team No but this Georgia Tech team is really athletic theyre about six six across the line except for the 611 Howard but they really rebound the ball very well in their successor Sturdivant drops it off to Kelly down the lane Howard down low doesnt get the bounce and the rebound by Tyson wanted a push down low Music Halls got six early and middle Brooks getting ready to check in for Clemson and two more for PJ Hall hes up to eight balls Georgia Tech turns it over yeah and heres the thing Jalen Moore right now is going to get into a fast start there you see him with a great offensive rebound great finish the jackets are really dominating the glass Music switch to Boost Mobile this holiday season and get a free Samsung Galaxy a23 5G phone featuring a quad

does it extremely well one team defends The Arc extremely well and I think thats why you saw Georgia Tech come out in a zone that they normally wait because they really wanted to take Clemsons threepoint shooting away and with tech will try to do is give you a different look so you dont get complicated and for Clemson they like transition and so far they really havent been able to get in transition but they have been able to penetrate The Zone whats the key for Clemson and attacking that Georgia Tech Zone oh they found it give the ball to PJ Hall and let him go to work I mean hes done a great job hes getting the blow right now but attacking the middle at that zone Pauls got eight of the ten Clemson points Ben Middlebrooks comes in to spell PJ masks Alloway PJ says when I got eight points Im not sure I really need a break yet Coach turned it over all had that right knee surgery back in July and theres been still working his way back not quite a hundred percent just yet as we get a foul charged but as much motion as Georgia Tech does and Josh passons does a great job with that they really do a good job of attacking the basket so theyre not constantly on the perimeter Tristan Maxwell dad was Vernon Maxwell NBA champion with the Houston Rockets great player Music good backcourt he Kenny Smith Jalen Moore with the feathery touch you know and what Georgia Tech has done they really attacked the elbows and they get a lot of slot drives because slot drives are hard to get help and defend upon Flint inside has to give it up Tyson lines it up clanks it off the back iron Here Comes Sturtevant sturdivand is so good at setting things up he really understands the offense and gets the ball where it needs to go aerospace engineering major Cal Steward of that Maxwell lets it Fly too strong under the rebound Clemson looking to push Applause and Hunter denied us to give it back up you wonder why Keck does though well against the three defensively and get back in transition so well middle Bronx bullies past Howard I tell you this Clemson front line has really starting to come on and their win against Penn State I thought they did an outstanding job battling Penn State on the glass and denying them a lot of its in close shots rebound more nearly had it knocked away keeps it in bounds and he was able to call a timeout to salvage The Possession will step his shot at 30 second timeout by Georgia Tech Music now ADT installs Google Nest devices which can be more peace of mind on your next date Erica is at the front doorbell knowing the babysitters arrive with familiar

win over the weekend against Alabama State and they got tasted by North Carolina prior to that much like last year the ACC has taken its lumps in nonconference but we saw the teams in League Play really improve in that show to the NCAA tournament a year ago yeah but it hasnt been any real bad losses I think nonconference I think they really stepped up and played a lot of really good teams you know North Carolina they talked about them early but the team that they lost to are going to beat a lot of teams and most of them will be in the NCAA tournament theres still a tough experience on that UNC team long Armando baycott The Usual Suspects dont feel sorry for him Applause good match up here Kelly against Hunter and nothing there for Kelly out of bounds to Clemson now we get a brotherly love back court here its Dylan Hunter and Chase Hunter number one number two Jason his fourth season with Clemson their leading scorer Dylan a freshman and a highly touted one hes got the ball down number 64 in the ESP of 100 well he really wanted to come and play with his brother thats just a lot of respect and also seeing a great job coach Burnell has done with his welding his development Tyson over Lance Terry contested Jay Applause Music should be one of the better Shooters in the ACC ENT I mean he can put the ball on the floor a lot of people think hes just catching shooting he really isnt he can go create his own shot hes very clever with using his body and creating space DoubleDouble Music all lost it down low able to recover as the size advantage and uses it PJ Hall is a legitimate big time player in the legitimate threat and around the basket hes so smart and so skilled thats Franklin transferred from southbound to Bala didnt play the last game after injuring his groin against North Carolina Hunter down the lane to the left hand Clemson has changed up instead of chasing the three theyre really getting the ball inside to the paint and getting to the front of the rim and its paying off for him unanswered for the Tigers Applause more from 18 a rebound to Dylan Hunter the freshman Applause another freshman RJ Godfrey in there for Clemson looking for a hall and they get the foul on Jalen Moore reaching in Tigers after being down early have put together eight straight to take a fourpoint lead on the road Music why did you invite him he was out there all

the reigning dogs versus the second chance Buckeyes the college football playoff semifinals December PJ Hall is showing his versatility here tonight there you stand with the short jump shot now he does a great job offensive rebounding and finishing now he gets the short jump shot in the lane daddy shows you his jump hook and just when you dont think he can do anything else he can rebound and go over the big hes been the main reason why Clemson has been able to dissect the Georgia Tech Zone 10 points all halfway to his fourth 20point game of the season Music and you brought it up before we went to break Clemson said okay youre going to take away the threepoint shot were going to attack inside its been successful well I tell you what coach Bunnell is an outstanding coach he knew the Georgia Tech was going to try to do that so and shoot around today he worked on trying to get the ball inside against the zone and especially with the post stops all gets positioned down low blocked from behind that was Jayvon Franklin averaging two blocks a game Smith on the other end has to give it up Franklin offense against home Applause or driving around Hall reverse layup not there but a foul son obviously George attacked in the way of Halls dominance inside so now they come over from the weak side and make a great block on it one of the things Georgia Tech offense is they really work from the elbows and by working from the elbows what it does is it gives driving lanes because you really cant help from the corner and it also allows them to get the ball in the paint and they get high percent high percentage shots its really a team thats still finding its identity you think of star power theyve lost over the last two seasons Moses right Jose Alvarado and then from last years team Michael Devoe Jordan Usher and more at the freethrow line part of a sophomore core with Miles Kelly and Debo Coleman theyre looking to those guys to be the next big three yeah thats sophomore class they really are excited about them with their versatility how hard they play in their attitude again package now changed his defense again Godfrey too strong Tyson the offensive rebound Hunter on the hesitation and we get an offensive foul as Lance Terry draws the charge Music Applause there you see him putting it down ah he was moving along Music Applause Smith just one out of 10 in his last two games and the referees was that a makeup call Coach they dont we dont we dont do makeup calls we just call what we see but obviously Music it wasnt a whole lot of contact there Applause Jayvon Franklin called for the offensive foul 13 foul on Georgia Tech Tex defense they come on looked like a 131 and then it falls back but it doesnt matter because once the ball gets to the middle again Clemson is very skilled so when guys get the ball they can make the next play Applause theres Debo Coleman score or just 10 a game more nearly tied up shot clock at 10 Smith has the mismatch with got three Godfrey recovers blocks the shot keeps it in bounds Applause transition opportunity Galloway bird of the midnight oil at both ends collapse does a great job that time its transition but it all came off a great defense this Clemson team shut down a really good Penn State team late in that game and shows that their interior defense to protecting the basket they do a very good job at Applause there you see the drive great block right there and theyre able to get God free and theyre able to get a great runoff coffee right there finishes a great layups after the Georgia Tech turnover Clemson takes over the Tigers in the midst of a 121 run Music refreshment on the floor for Clemson Godfrey Beetle and Dylan Hunters Beetle to his fellow freshman Hunter and theyre going to get middle Brooks for over the back trying to get that rebound 15 foul on the tigers that was a good call shuttle Brooks didnt clear out with that first look for Georgia Tech right now that they like to do some dribble weave action so that they can penetrate and get to the basket Music Id look for them to do something like that or try to have Howard come up with a ball screen and roll hard to the basket and try to get an easy one Music Lance Terry the gardnerweb transfer now it comes back to Kelly driving down the lane off the window rebound Middlebrooks Applause oh God oh Josh Beetle the redshirt freshman from Columbia South Carolina on a couple of state titles there Music shot block at nine Here Comes Godfrey downhill lost it and hell stay with Clemson five to shoot Applause Georgia Tech does a great job in their individual man defense they really do a really good job Titans coming back we always like to get a shooter in the game with the shot clocks around five or under Godfrey providing some good minutes for Brad Brownell Music Applause flash down to two Galloway was not aware of the shot clock if its a violation and he said he said it by far so he got the ball into Tyson he came off a low cross screen and they need to get it to him a little quicker again Id look for Georgia Tech to have the same sort of action look for the dribble handoff ball screen instead of turnover Georgia Tech just one field goal in almost eight minutes now Galloway pull up yesner Applause collection rolling a 151 run for the Tigers they extend it to a 10point lead Music give the gift of shine only at sales the diamond store Dana will like these red and green I dont know I never met the guy he does exist s i do exist Music uh Santa we know yall can cook real good but sometimes the

getting out there helping people hard work doesnt feel like hard work and even though you dont do it for the five star reviews you get them anyway thats why you work for two men in a truck oh Music Applause youve got an older team in Clemson youve got a younger Georgia Tech Team figuring out its identity and look at the Lost production those are some big time names the last two years they really are and uh theyre trying to fill them with younger guys and these guys are going to develop and be good I think right now what has happened Georgia Tech has lost its patience early in the game they were very patient and methodical in what they were trying to attack and how they were trying to attack theyre trying to rush it in this Clemson team like you said is a veteran team and its really taken advantage of it three guys who lead Georgia Tech and scoring all sophomores and all the role players at Best a season to go Applause foreign gets free from Hunter no good I thought stutterband when he was in early and really brought some calmness to the Georgia Tech offense and thats why coach got him back soon wide open barbecue sauce Applause the spacing right now that Clemson has in his offense theyre really comfortable Josh is going to have to come up with some sort of Defense just to throw him off their pace 181 run Terry basket does not count Applause Big Time move he really fought the thought that that defense Music although Clemson does not overly athletic on his front line they are tall and again fundamentally they really move their feet and they challenge a lot of stuff at The Rim you see him driving right there and is able to get to create the contact to get the foul second on middle Brooks Georgia Tech now in the bonus Rodney Howard coming off that double double down to five Stern event with two with one and his shot clock violation so weve seen both teams now become become unaware of the shot clock yeah but what happened that time is Clemson is not is handling the dribble handoffs very well and theyre handling the role very well so its not space there for Tech guys to get to the basket and create easy opportunities this is the same type of Defense Clemson played against Penn State who really liked to get the ball in the paint it was very physical it was a great wins for Clemson because they handled that extremely well against a really good Penn State team Applause Chase Hunters three planks Howard the pole Kelly the other way when you say you want to see patience what does that entail on this possession well what you want to see is an execution you want to see him get the shot that they practice from the guy that they wanted that they want to shoot the basketball thats what they want they want more getting downhill lets get patience lets go out there for handoff to reject Kelly Moore and get the ball where they can turn the corner and get to the baskets thats the sort of patience its not settled for a jump shot or try to force the ball where it cant go Music so Jalen Moore will go to the line after the foul on RJ Godfrey Josh pastner has likened Moores trajectory ultimately to maybe a Moses Wright who was one of the great developmental stories in the history of ACC basketball zero star recruits its a player of the year before he left Applause Harvard and Kansas Thursday 7 Eastern on ESPN2 mens college basketball coverage continuing for this holiday season Tommy Hamrick Tommy Hamilton has that Harvard team again playing well he took it to defend his job there at Harvard hes got a thing called The Breakfast Club he had President Obama speak at him so you know you know hes got some clout and you can get President Obama to come speak and Judge Reinhold to come speak I wouldnt put anything past Tommy Hamilton he made our life miserable when he was at Duke he was part of that clown he and Johnny Dawkins theres a lot of battles on this floor yeah those are some great battles those Duke teams that were ascending under Mike shazewsky in the late 80s Applause PJ Hall dipping under Howard its tipped up here comes Davon Smith he began his career at Mississippi State accelerates down the lane a lot of contact down low and were going to get a foul against Georgia Tech its on Rodney Howard that time Howard got a guy on his back and refused to let him move and was stealing him off Music can you imagine this league with a young Bobby criminal the young Mike and a young Jimmy Valvano you talk about some exciting nights now the fans always got their moneys worth the guys behind the scenes like you beatled for three Applause Music Smith nearly had it taken away almost nine minutes since Georgia Techs last field goal offense has gone stagnant in the half court Applause again but at least theyve slowed it up they start using their screens and making and getting some fouls on Clemson they were going with some flex stuff that they wind up off the elbows Music calling a tiger Beetle called for the foul away from the ball Music those guards do not like to be screened by the pigs Im just telling you they get the holding and grabbing and pushing they do not like all that contact sometimes its survival Beatles listed 63182 Debo Coleman 66 and a sturdy 215 giving up 30 plus pounds Applause Hunter down the lane Applause Big Time move that time by Hunter he got the rim and instead of just trying to lay it straight he changed hands with it and was able to draw the foul oh my God I know you always look at the pace of a game Clemsons got the pace at this game the way they would like it to be Applause the Sunday Christmas day and that means five NBA games on the Slate on ESPN ABC starts at noon Knicks whove now won eight straight taking on the Sixers it ends at 10 30 pm Eastern with the Suns and the Nuggets get to see LeBron Luca Giannis job pretty good slate Steph drivers Applause Music Kelly against Galloway in Georgia Tech still cant buy a bucket from the field Smith on the drive elevates and finishes at his desk with Moore and Kelly are able to dribble drive and they do their best dribble driving from the elbows Applause Smith one of the best dunkers in the game a lot of contact with he and Hunter no call and Hunter finishing down low Smith the other way almost out of control Howard hes been working on that shot and practice pays off well thats what got him in the starting lineup because hes able to scream and then when they drop off of him hes able to make that shot at the foul line Applause protect being very physical trying to get over the streams the facial Applause Music more at the other end muscles it in plus one great drive right there great finish you see the roll right there by Hall great finish hes had a great first half Music tis the

the keys right there according to coach when you see it from the Tigers so I like this team I like the Personnel But ultimately I like how they played with PJ Hall hes all over the court but when hes around the perimeter plays outside in tough to figure out totally different team was PJ Hall healthy coach its always good to have your best players on the floor coach Clark you understand that Music all right fellas well get it back to you in about 352 of game time Jalen Moore playing with the two fouls at the free throw line to complete a threepoint play Georgia Tech that last field goal by Moore their first and almost 10 minutes and more misses the free throw you know right now mentally back really has to lock in and be able to execute and finish this half out both offensively and defensively according to their game plan all to Chef Lynn through traffic Clemsons game plan has worked exceptionally well theyve been able to get the ball high low theyve been able to get the ball to the post area against the Zone they have really had good shot selection and theyve shut down playing good Gap defense Georgia Georgia Coleman using the shot fake and this fires from three Applause Music concert waits for the Cavalry Galloway catch released Applause Kelly lines It Up In and Out and out see thats not the shot that Georgia Tech really likes to get they like to get action a lot better something closer Kelly Moore made it up with a great block the leader from Smith and the car rot Tyson the struggles from the field continue for Georgia Tech coach Burnell wants him to slow it down when youre on the road you like to try to control the game offensively by getting the shots that you want ball movement and making the defense have to work no call Hunter left it short Kelly from Deep Applause another one that goes in and out Applause both teams right now a little gas Paul has raised his fist Music good call there by coach but now he saw his team with a little Gap Clemson

of a triple header Jalen Wilson and defending Champion Kansas welcome Harvard and at field house its the final matchup for these teams before the holiday break when you were coaching you had that time before the holidays what was your message for your team because usually when you got back you were in the throes of conference play I tried to get a win so I could have a good Christmas that was first and foremost but you were your wife uh that but I think that things have changed now because youre playing conference games so early that you have to wind up having some real tough game I think one of the things I still coach pastor and Coach but now before the game they were smiling they were happy and all you can tell its still December you hate that we get to February thats when the Just For Men is wrong Im telling you you know everybody really hopeful and positive you watch these two teams though you can see the upshot it might be bumpy along the way but there are pieces here without question but both of them are predicated on style of play and I think their execution and their skill level allows to allow these two teams to be good under the pullup Sean hasnt fallen for him tonight Applause Kelly Georgia Techs leading scorer Galloway greets him but Kelly has not had a lot of easy look really good when he comes off the dribble hands off like they try to get him right there and he can drive it to the basket thats when hes really good hes able to draw the foul its the session about shuffling Music Miles Kelly sophomore from Stone Mountain Georgia was a bench player last year and then the last two games of the season regular season finale he goes for 16 against BC 19 against Louisville in the ACC tournament and that has been a springboard into what is becoming a breakout sophomore season one thing is really good with the basketball and hes not a big strong upper body guy but yet hes basketball strong hes able to finish at The Rim take the contact and come to threepoint play Music Applause points now for Kelly some pressure from Georgia Tech easy clear for Clemson Clemson has been able to get the shots from the gods that they wanted to shoot him and where they wanted them to shoot or find DJ Hall got off to a fast start Hunter Tyson nearly had it knocked away able to recover shot clock in five pass down low Hall wants to goaltend and he will get it this Clemson team plays so well together I mean theyre selfish they help each other and as a team right now I think theyre really playing well there you see a move in the basket ball and then he goes his dunks it goes through the rim definitely a goal 10 Applause about a second and a half differential between the game clock and the shot clock some Georgia Tech can essentially hold for one I dont think Georgia Tech has to make a lot of adjustments at halftime I think they just got to clean up a couple of things they had some open looks they just didnt make it Smith leaning in and hes able to draw the foul that has kept Georgia Tech in this game the ability to get to the basket and get to the foul line well again but where the way they run their offense working out of the elbows really is allow thriving lanes and its very difficult to help because normally theyve got Shooters in the corner so if the corner guy comes over then they can kick that guy for a jump shot if the post happens they roll the post and Howard is big and 611 and he can finish around the rim so offensively theyre pretty proficient when theyre able to turn the corner and get down here Applause Music 59 seconds to go here comes Hunter across the timeline splits the D and a foul on the floor itll be a 11 for Chase Hunter 76 free throw shooter this season and Kyle Sturdivant picks up the foul thats what you dont want what you want to do is you hit him with some pressure but you want to continue to retrieve back to the foul line and make them take a shot through you but you dont want to give a guy like Hunter easy baskets easy points at the foul line and he gets the front end so much of Clemson season will depend on how Chase Hunter adapts to that point guard role the early returns yeah but again if its a game like tonight like a hall that steps up and can help him it takes a lot of the pressure off so Tyler getting somebody else besides him that can take and be able to score it just takes a lot of pressure off of one guy substitutions now for Georgia Tech getting the right Personnel in 21 seconds to go Clemson by 14 Debo Coleman will inbound Music launches it down Court Shetland heaves it the other way a good good half right now for Clemson they were able to handle the Zone early they were able to get the shots they wanted did a great job defending the payment which Fanny is he won state championships in high school hes just a winner but the thing that makes him so good is his versatility and his skill set hes battled injuries too had the left foot injury that he played through last year in an offseason surgery that had a surgery on his thank you Jalen Moore is called for the offensive foul and that is now three on one of Georgia Techs top players Roy K was more and Kelly happy to get going that time it was a clear charge but what theyve done is they come up with a high ball screen they try to spread the floor so therefore Moore and Kelly have more room to get to the basket Dylan Hunter the freshman theres his brother Chase Applause going down low again this one its taken away but Maxwell could not stay in bounds Applause PJs Gonna Learn hes got to come meet the ball a little bit more especially in the lane because hes a scorer down there and guys are going to collapse on him a little faster than what maybe theyve done in the past five on the floor for Clemson boots we got 16 along with Hunter Tyson chasing doing Hunter and Brevin Galloway for Georgia Tech Sturtevant Maxwell Kelly Moore and Rodney Howard the original starting five Music almost another turnover this time they get a foul on Galloway his second whenever you get behind you need to get some turnovers you need some transition baskets Georgia Tech has gotten very few transition baskets tonight Music thats how Josh pastor wants to play offensively Sturdivant over to Howard the double team comes and another careless turnover by Tech well right now I mean Clemson is really feasting off of their defense theyre talking theyre moving their feet theyre really doing a good job of containing the dribble drives of Georgia Tech foreign Music has its largest lead of the game Applause the Hunter Music brother Chase Chase back to Dylan doesnt go that would have made the family happy again that time Georgia Tech tried to push the ball never got the ball to the Elbow never got the ball into pain and transition Howard defended by Hall a lot of dribbling for the big van now its Sturdivant and knocked Away by Tyson able to recover and we get a foul down low its on PJ Hall two coaches never like to see their big guy pick up a chief foul like that they just want him to move their feet get their hands up and make them shoot over top of you Music now they only worry for Clemson in that first half it was a little foul trouble a number of players ended that first half with multiple fouls Music Sturdivant down the lane off balance and hits Sturtevant has played real well I think for Georgia Tech they played the best when hes been in the game initiating the offense Hunter Music Applause and thats a goaltan hall they went right away two more for PJ Hall hes up to 18 on nine of 12 shooting yeah and and hes getting those points because of his versatility I mean now theyre looking to kind of post them a little bit more but earlier he was at the high post and really kind of driving and passing from there Music thank you Maxwell catch and shoot rushing see I dont really think thats Georgia Techs game is shooting perimeter jump shot I think theyre really good off the bounce and I think that they really need to go back and do that more and I know coach passing is a little bit frustrated right now Im trying to figure out how he can help his team get downhill a little bit better step back by Galloway isnt there their senior wanted to be close to home Clemson was his dream school after year of Boston College transferred and it was he who reached out to Brad Brownell said hey I want to come play for Clemson Music Applause youre going to see more of that in the transfer portal Applause the kids remember that those initial initial relationships and contacts they do carry a lot of weight when he was 12 years old at a Clemson camp Galloway started his career at the College of Charleston Four Seasons in Charleston and Franklin with a chance for a threepoint play and this is where PJ Hall cannot get frustrated he picked up his third foul hes got to move his feet hes going to learn when you start scoring points they start coming at you and thats what coach is explaining to him hey just back up get your hands up in the hand make them shoot over top of them such a competitor though 20 points tonight in 20 minutes on 10 of 13 shooting his fourth 20point game of the season as Franklin the South Alabama transfer completes the threepoint play Tech is trying to put a little bit more pressure on the ball now to try to speed up the tempo but this is a veteran Clemson team I dont think theyre going to really speed him up too much what happens to the offense now without Hall uh oh you can go through Tyson I think you go through Hunter um fouls early in the second half Hunter able to draw the foul that time its on Debo Coleman his third Clemson by 15 at the under 16 minutes out we know yall can cook real good but sometimes the fam just wants Popeyes for dinner and

on the far end you coached him and let me tell you something when he came here they had bags over their heads after two years there was lines around the block um hes the foundation of this Georgia Tech program took us to an ACC Championship was all ACC and not only him he was ACC Rookie of the Year and Then followed Dal rimful Pharrell and Hammonds four straight ACC Rookie of the Year all because of Mark Price and Bobby criminals will tell you hes the guy that got it going so Lethal Weapon three doesnt happen without Mark Price nothing happens without Mark Christ we all may be parking cars right now doing something else he was the key incredible shooter incredible leader incredible human being and helped take this program to unbelievable Heights I had a great career in the NBA an AllStar with the Cleveland Cavaliers shes only about six feet he said he was six one but he was about six feet but he could knock down jump shots and he had the heart of a burglar a guy with his ring range Marksmanship can you imagine him in basketball today uh incredible I mean he could stretch the defense and just knew how to play John Sallys Jersey is hanging up there and Im telling he had a lot to do with Salvage Jersey hanging up there soon he had a lot to do with criminals name being on this floor and he certainly had a lot to do with me becoming a head coach hes just an unbelievable human being and you get to have a nice moment with him before the game he came over he saw you and sought you out you know fire bills camaraderie and and building this program and creating that sort of spirit and all this was a thriller Dome this place was back and it was a lot of excitement yeah its her Tysons three gives Clemson its largest lead of the game Music attack offensively shooting just 37 37 Clemson on the other hand 54 percent Music freshman picks up a second Clemson coaches down a little bit upset with Beetle not getting through those screens theyve done a good job all day Clemson handling the screens handling the dribble handoffs without fouling all right almost a fivesecond violation the Clemson bench asking for it long three by Coleman Off the Mark should people talk about threepoint shooting good threepoint shooting teams get it in transition get it off the triple penetration get it offensive rebound and kick kick outs but very few teams can just just pull up threes and knock them down and so Georgia Tech has to do a better job right now A really attacked in the basket theyre trying but the Clemson defense is really doing a good job of keeping the ball in front of him you know in football you see a lot of quarterbacks try to make the off platform throws because Apache for Holmes or a Josh Allen Canadas Kelly knocks down the three in basketball you see what a Steph Curry can do and some of these great Shooters at the next level does that get young players sometimes into some bad habits well I mean theres some players that only God can stop I mean theyre just that talented and good most guys arent that good and so they use some help from their coaching and their teammates to be able score Franklin in transition thats how Josh passner wants to play without question it comes off the defense and trying to get this crowd into the game right now and Tyson with two hands see thats what makes Clemson such a tough team to play against because theyre skill set they can pass the ball they dribble the basketball well and they dont beat themselves 12 points nine rebounds for Hunter Tyson Applause Franklin and middle Brooks get tied up and well get middle Brooks for his third foul and PJ Hall coming back in for Clemson yeah you know right there Tyson on a good side cut at that time against the ball unable to finish Music coaches telling the Jones that big guy dont foul her up we got control of the game lets not bail him out right now foreign Music working on Hall whos got the three fouls now Kelly theres the double Terry Baseline not there onto the other way one on three stops pauses Tyson off the side of the rim rebound Coleman Applause the GardnerWebb transfer now its Smith down low big finish thats Jameson Franklin hes starting to heat up in the second half yes he is but Cactus starting to get better penetration to the basket creating some rotation Applause George attack looking to make a run here Applause Music Applause the basket counts plus one great drive that time by Galloway and one of the things you see is Tech is really pushing up to take away the threepoint shooting but Clemson is recognizing that and theyre driving the ball hard to the basket Music you know we talked at the top how you know which was going to give the Georgia Tech defense against the three or Clemson shooting at three and Clemson said okay were not going to chase the three if youre going to take that away were going to pack you inside and thats what theyve done Galloway completes the threepoint play two seasons ago with the College of Charleston he tore his ACL was not quite the same last year with PC admittedly out of shape everybody around the Clemson program says hes in the best shape of his career thats not just spring training talk you start to see it on the court yeah you know those type of injuries take some time and everybody kind of comes off of those type of injuries at their own pace but hes certainly starting to get his motor running and his reels up and under him Paul follows The Postman Always Rings Twice Music Clemson is physically beating beating Georgia Tech on the glass Music before you get

Im on the corner of Fowler and 10th outside of mccamish Pavilion waiting for my Uber to go back to the hotel and this Honda Pilot pulls up rolls down the window and says hey do you need a ride its Josh pass and I said youre driving a Honda Pilot he said Im low maintenance hes a tremendous human being he when he was in college was coaching an AAU team he wound up going to Arizona and wow and blue ocean wound up making him an assistant coach after he walked on there because he graduated early and uh in fact I was in a recruiting battle over a really top player and Josh was the guy was I was recruiting against you reminded him of that today Chris Owens a heck of a player wound up finishing at Texas a battle uh Im not gonna let him walk more people I mean thats not good for the resume Terry Moore had the rebound ran into his own man and lost it out of bounds and that sort of sums up the evening for Georgia Tech yeah but you know theres a lot of time left I dont think Georgia Tech has to get away from what they want to do and how they want to do it I think if they can defensively get a couple turnovers push the ball get a couple easy baskets I can get this crowd back in the game I think they can fight their way back into this they dont just have to settle for shots always drills the three and the lead is 21 hes talking to coach because coach game would look like we dont need that and he said but I had it coach I had it whats the line Shooters gonna shoot he has the reputation as a volume shooter but thats brother Braden played tight end in Clemson but that shows a relationship that coach Brownell has with his players I mean they looking along they really like him they respect him and they play hardcore Music Tyson 12 points 12 rebounds for Tyson the sixth DoubleDouble the pass deflected and comes to Davon Smith leading leading three on two Smith locked with the rim with a strong finish by more on the following thats what Clemson cannot do they cannot

Clemson back in Action Friday December 30th take on and State you play 20 League games youre going to start early usually conference playing the ACC has started right around New Years starts a little earlier these days they like to open the season play one early this Music both Corruption of Georgia Tech and looking around the league Virginia backtoback losses Houston top five team Miami looks really good Miami is really good I you know um they have a really good back court Isaiah Wong is the real deal I think he really does a great job of controlling games he knows when to take his shot he knows how to share the ball and Coach laronega is is the Maestro of that Miami offense you know you start to look around the league who can maybe make a turnaround a sleeper in the second half State starting to get some pieces back after a rough start well once they get healthy I think coach Hamilton has made a living in this league with this depth and wearing people down he doesnt have the depth but he does have some talent and so he will be able to get back in the race uh I really like Pittsburgh I think that they I think coach cape has done a really good job of putting a real good group together that plays very well together they had a win against the Syracuse yesterday its hard its hard to Zone Clemson because they do shoot the ball so well Tyson does not get the soft roll Sturdivant accelerates drives and runs you know I go back to the beginning of the game it was interesting why Georgia Tech started in the zone because very rarely do they start in the zone they normally go to it in the second half sturdivan whos had a really outstanding day that time he finishes off the glass squirtleman does a really good job of getting them in their offense and getting the ball to guys where they can operate Music threepoint play complete and Clemsons lead still sturdy but down to 19 Galloways got a dozen to go along with five helpers Jason turges two of nine today hes Clemsons leading scorer and better than 14 a game almost 15 a game but this is where Ive always believed when youre on the road you have to control the game with your iPhone you have to wear the clock down you got to get good shots you got to get the ball for guys that can score you have to be able to control the game with your offense Tysons 13th rebound possession for Clemson clock down to eight Applause three Hunter on the drive through traffic off the front rim Moore saves it and youre Music Applause good or as a dozen see thats where Moores got to look catch he had a he had an open shot there instead of driving the basketball hes a young player hes got to be able to read the defense especially there in transition hes a tremendous offensive player hes going to do nothing but get better most of the guys at Tech have gotten better with their Player Development something Josh pastner Prides himself in over to Dylan Hunter five to shoot Tysons gonna have to put it up Galloway launches almost hit him Galloway Doug my shooting Applause sturt events Applause again Im really impressed with Sterling hes done a really good job of organizing the Georgia Tech Team taking the shots that are available mentioned his development we talked earlier how Georgia Tech had developed Moses right as PJ Hall continues to dominate inside well finish that thought on the other side PJ Hull a

talking about Player Development look at Hunter Tyson the way he has come along in his Clemson career you know now in his Fifth Season Jalen Moore is somebody that Josh pastner sees that can have a Moses white like trajectory Player Development however is exponentially more difficult these days with kids being able to transfer hey Im not playing Ill go somewhere else yeah but I think it is but I think its really necessary I think kids have to recognize their abilities and some guys can step in right away make an impact and some guys it takes them some time to develop and I think part of the recruiting process is identifying those kids that need that and be able to give them that I think both of these two programs are teaching program and they do a good job of developing players and therefore every year they may not be on top of the league but theyre always going to be competitive and those guys get to be Juniors and seniors thats when they can be dominant the challenges right when your phone rings and says well youre not developing by sitting on the bench come play for me well you know there are a lot of people that think that theyre expert in basketball because they watch it and because they play it a little bit on the playground but thats far different than running college basketball programs where youre involved not just in the athletic development of a young man but also the academic development also the mental maturity of a young man and those are things that really go untalked about and unnoticed but most of the best coaches they take all that into consideration and so sometimes you know you have people getting guys ears that really they shouldnt be listening to uh because they dont understand the full scope of all of this Applause you know I used to tell my mom used to think I was the best coach because I was she was my mom some moms think their kid is the best player because thats their kid their kid and sometimes it just doesnt work like that acrobatic shot by Chase Hunter that turns into this dilemma where youre asking a kid whos 18 19 20 years old to see the forest from the trees and you know you put yourself in those shoes at that age its not easy to do yeah but but I think that the leadership there at different institutions I mean this league has some really outstanding coaches and you look at this league the ACC and all of the schools have been dominant at one point in time because of the leadership because of the fan base because of the educational background that it had so um you just have to understand where you are and where youre trying to get to Franklin Clinton almost knocked Away by Moore Music you know you talk about Mark Price when he came here I talked about they wore bags over the head a good another good player Bruce darling for just walked by he was the best Rebound in God I think in the history of this of the ACC is certainly while he plays and those two together made an awful good back to him Applause Zeus have set the foundation for this program is RJ Godfrey Cashes in from short range his dad Randall Godfrey spent 11 seasons in the NFL hes a linebacker Applause Kelly bumped by Chase Hunter and still gets it to go one thing about Josh passners team they dont have any hangover effect I mean theyre not playing they did they havent played as well as they like to tonight but theyll come back and theyll look at film and hes such a positive coach that they have the next outing I guarantee you theyll play a lot better and respond better working out of a high post has it go through his legs and it comes to more Music Applause pull up three Kelly yes Music Applause the team for Miles Kelly Applause Music Applause and again you see Kelly right there he had some space is able to knock it down and the thing that creates space is transition penetration and when you get that space youre able to get better looks at the basket foreign his confidence continues to grow seven straight games now where hes bidded double figures he had 21 in that game against Iowa Music so theres some great cathedrals of basketball in this league this is the one the Thriller Dome you have obviously the gene Jones Cameron Syracuse in the Carrier Dome I mean this this league has some great places and venues to play and when this place gets rocking it is as good as any place in the country the fan base the city of Atlanta theres a lot to work with Dylan Hunter no Hall saves it Tyson down the lane and gets free for two coach Bunnell is really coaching he doesnt care about the score right now the guys are really playing well together hes excited this Clemson team is really playing extremely well tonight Music foreign Die Hard good choice only one I trust Music imagine if

back to you guys Jordan Kelsey thank you Hunter Tyson with a double double tonight 14 points 13 rebounds Clemson controlling the paint theyve got 48 points of the paint Georgia Tech has 54 points overall we talked early how coming into the game Clemson best threepoint shooting team in the ACC Georgia Tech best defender for the three as Coleman knocks it down Clemson hasnt shot a will from the outside it hasnt mattered know theyve gone to the inside game they played through PJ Hall and hes been able not only to score but set up some other guys Music Applause Pauls got 25 backing down Howard anticipating the double it doesnt come shoots over Howard tipped up to Moore Applause Music Applause Music and were gonna foul on Clemson Clemson Tyson thats really not what check does well they do they do a lot better when they go with their dribble handoff when they run their Flex action where they work through the elbows with their post guys and are able to control the game that way with their offense Debo Coleman the highest rated recruit Dr Josh passenger era top 50 player out of high schooler three minutes to go in regulation a new Shroff Perry Clark happy holidays Merry Christmas Applause that time of the year get your holiday shopping done whats on the shopping list for these two is are they getting ready to move into the new year and really cheap at the ACC well I think Clemson has found the formula that works and I think the biggest thing is staying close together and continuing to grow with what theyre doing and trust each other I love the way they play defense I mean again they did a good job of taking away a Georgia Tech team that likes to drive the ball they did the same thing to Penn State and so theyre going to be a force I think if they can continue to develop you know with PJ Hall scoring in the inside and shooting the ball I think that theyre going to be an awful tough hour Zach theyre still trying to find that identity offensively well you know I I think that they have to stay and if they get behind they cant get away from it I think they have to find a way to get easy baskets they really dont get a lot of easy baskets everythings a fist fight chase after possession and so you have to foreign Applause Hunter Tyson 14 points 13 rebounds five double doubles on the season for him you know hes really tough he stays in movement he understands he spots up with jump shots real well you know and he plays with the confidence that I think falls down to the other guys on the team he never gets flustered and hes always picking guys up and so you know its just a very positive player and a positive teammate and this Clemson team theyre Biggs Tyson PJ Hall passes well they are you know then physically theyre not overpowering you look at them they dont necessarily scare you but their skill set is such that they can run good offense they can execute things and defensively they have really picked it up Im telling you the Penn State game they did a tremendous job they did a tremendous job here tonight against Georgia Tech defensively theyre a good ball Club offense too great spacing Chase Hunter continues to get better in that point guard role more to the left hand Applause foul down low its gonna be on PJ ball they have any real weakness rebounding the basketball man theyve done it by committee but you know no one is just a dominant rebounder and so they may have one of those nice where they face a team that has a dominant rebounder and theyre going to have to really step up and play against that and youll see a few of those in the ACC especially North Carolina tomorrow 7 Easter right here on ESPN2 Harvard goes to five gallon to take on defending Champion Kansas Music Applause thank you Music went out of bounds hunts are right in front of our broadcast position good space you know that time by Clemson and they dont theyre not allowed Georgia Tech to try to double them or really pressure out of what they wanted to run sturdivance coming through drive through quick First Step its a nice find after transferring from USC to Georgia Tech a few years back and hes hes played really well I mean and so it kind of gives you a starting point Music Applause down by more Here Comes Terry down the lane Lefty layup good anybody that knows Josh pastner knows hes not going to ever be negative hes going to be positive hes going to get these guys back foreign Applause barring something completely unforeseen Clemsons probably going to win this game Pastor youre searching for positives you might be able to take this final segment of the game and say hey look the this is what we are capable of text made six of its last state trailed by as many as 23 12 point game with 110 to go now the press and the foul on Kelly you know as a coach you know Brad Burnell is really concerned because youve got this game it seems like under control but a couple turnovers and this thing can get away and weve all seen that happen and thats the greatest fear fell was on Lance Terry Music Summit hey theyve taken Hall out of the game because of the four thousand they dont want him to pick up a fifth not knowing how this thing may end I know how you coaches operate Never Say Never right no you know youve seen too much Applause bad Beach Galloways got 14 some perfect nine of nine for the freethrow lines Applause Kelly that was from the tropical Capricorn Music Applause Music gets it over the timeline Galloway now lost it and thatll be over at the back turnover 49 seconds to go Clemson up 14 thats one of those turnovers that the coach is hard to explain you just want him to back it out and run some plaque and he lost it did you see Galloways expression he looked over at his coach and he had the expression like I know youre I know youre upset I got you sturdivance to pull up 14 for sturdivance a new season High he had 13 over the weekend against Alabama State yeah everybodys got to come to the ball be strong with the ball Applause Music hunter gets bumped what happens a lot of times the guys with the ball like honey he wanted to get fouled he knew they were going to have to foul so the better foul Shooters like to hold on to it the guys that cant shoot trying to get rid of it real quick stats padding time Applause Music and hunter gets the front end of the one and one Applause 14 points for Chase Hunter four Clemson players and double figures tonight Jay Hall leading all scorers with 25 Terry Jacks it up shuffling grabs the rebound and Clemson can dribble out the clock Theory Music when youre up you should tell your team they still havent surrendered so we got to keep playing thank you Applause Music Perry This Clemson team last year an underperformed expectations 10th of the ACC 812 in League Play but 20 and play he coached in this league you get off to a 20 start in conference those are two wins that are banked in the vault and theyre sealed and theyre very precious and and more important I think the wave Clemson is playing I think if doing the things that coach wants to do and theyre doing things that theyre game plan to do and theyre going to give a lot of people a lot of problems final score from the game 79 Georgia Tech 66 the Tigers 20 and ACC play the yellow jackets fall to Owen two in conference Music Applause Georgia Tech came in with the reputation of defending the three as well as anybody
