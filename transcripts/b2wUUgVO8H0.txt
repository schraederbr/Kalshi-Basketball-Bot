its a final tuneup for SMU before they hit conference play against Virginia at home on Saturday exciting times on the hilltop in all sports and we are underway in Dallas John Little Brian Burton Briana senson and the whole crew SMU is going to have a size advantage today Yan trayor in the post for the Mustangs going to the baby hook and hitting it to start the scoring yeah they want to make a specific intentional effort to get the ball inside early and often to take advantage of the height Advantage you just talked about great job by Alabama State this year to take care of the basketball only 10 turnovers a game they start basically three point cards and they also stroke it from Deep CJ hin has been hot from outside CJ hin is a Hooper youre going to see a lot of production from him if Alabama state is doing what they do well he is a big part of that a different starting five for Alabama state in this one as we get a look at it and theres also a foul called against Alabama State Amar Knox TJ madlock and CJ Hines those three point guards if you will for Tony madlock and then youve got just Daven Walker getting his first start of the year at power forward and inside yubang okon is the big man at 7 one for Alabama State coming in at three and four with some key wins this year including victories over Omaha and Lamar a team that smus already played this year on the pick and roll slipping to the cup EA toou gathers his own miss the tip out and a chance for Alabama state to run theyre very good in transition and a pull up three by just Daven Walker is round and off yeah I love the way yoga Tulu tried to attack the rim on that last one but this team is Scrappy and tough and they are not backing down good jobs holding ground almost got a charge in that transition opportunity as well staven Walker making his first start of the year called for the blocking foul as trayor the Euro tried to go with the Euro I like that I see what you did there just I saw it now went for it looks like y yatu may be injured they got poked in the eye possibly kept grabbing his face uh trayor will not be shooting based on that transition foul the big man at 7 foot2 265 attracts a lot of attention and on for the first time for SMU is Keon Ambrose Hilton third year transfer from Alabama originally from Toronto the SMU starting five yigu has already gone to the bench but you has settled on this lineup and they really like it BJ Edwards in the post going up and over hes got three straight double figure games he and boy Miller starting in the back court along with cross trayor and igaa its its amazing to me that they do a lot play for the point guard so often and theyve gotten that so regularly in games what does that tell you about uh their belief in BJ Edwards is another three goes down for Bama State this time TJ mad well they love they absolutely love BJ Edwards what hes done in the off season what hes become as a player how much confidence they put in him um and how much work hes put in he defends on one side of the ball they love that about him and hes very unselfish and hes gotten to where he can make outside shots so thats opened up his entire game and hes playing at an alltime level meanwhile we almost forget how fast this SMU team plays make or Miss literally Bama State makes a three they get it out the net and its transition off of a make and part of the reason why theyre so good at that is because of tryo amb brose Hilton and the way these bigs can run the floor thats not a guard passing to another guard thats a guard passing to a big the last two times on the fouls trayor knocks down both foul shots good start for him at the line this season hitting 75 of his shots lets take a look at tonights keys to the game Brian what do we got yeah its going to be big for Alabama state to be able to force turnovers and they have to make shots theyve already started that way but outside shots is going to be key for them because theyre playing against so much size and there you see the third three so right on Q that is a big key for them to be able to compete in this game and then for SMU defending without fouling defending is huge they need to keep Bama State off the line make them make tough shots and then offensively they must dominate the paint in all facets that last three coming off an offensive rebound SMU definitely has the paint advantage in this one they did not want to give up offensive boards in this one as prayor spins on the Baseline the fade away doesnt fall offside rebound knocked off of SMU last touched by cross well this Alabama State team comes in very much battle tested against Power Conference teams they played very well to a Cincinnati team thats one of the top teams in the net number 11 actually in the country they were one of the closer games in that and then they had LSU in a very tight game where they were leading with 10 minutes to go in the second half he actually had an 11point lead at one point in that game as Hinds misses on the three but the Hornets can make threes and thats one of the reasons that theyre able to not only stay in games but win big games as well and this is a foul on the floor no basket boopy Miller fouled by Amar Knox but that threepoint shooting weve talked about it this season how it can even out ball games yeah to me its the great equalizer in basketball you may have a height Advantage you may have other type of skill Advantage but if you can make shots it can make up for a multitude of things that you may not have so coach mat loock was very intentional and said he loved their defense rebounding and grit last year but they werent a good shooting team they intentionally went out and recruited and added more shooting to this roster and it is paying off lots of guys with green lights on this roster more than nine threes a game knocks adjusting in the lane his shot altered cross comes down with it up the floor to BJ Edwards heres this quick paced SMU team cross down the lane cant finish but challenged and fouled by yubang okan who picks up his second and thats the part of it they love to crash the offensive glass this team hasnt gotten great at it yet but it leaves you vulnerable in transition defense which is SMU arguably their biggest strength there you see the other bigs you almost forget Matt cross is playing the small forward or or the three position right now hes running the floor down the middle and such good guards that can pass and create I love that about poopy Miller and about Edwards along with Chuck Harris they have three lead guards essentially starting guards that can great at any point in time especially in transition cross two for two so hes 67 meanwhile Alabama state starts a three point guard lineup basically and brings it in a fourth guard now well see how smus he highight Advantage helps them out at this point in the matchup meanwhile Alabama State going with a four guard alignment right now and going Baseline madlock kicks it out hindes extra pass Walker loads up for three another offensive rebound madlock Twirls to the hole cant hit this time and a travel on Ambrose Hilton yeah I just love the effort again from Alabama State SMU we know how good they are but this reminds you a little bit of what you saw with California Baptist when they went on the road and played in that event and had to have a gamewinner meanwhile coach Matt lock has done an outstanding job uh with this program and you can just tell by how their team plays how unselfish there you mentioned the threepoint guards in the lineup it gives him ball handling and decision making and playmaking on every single possession a rare turnover there but a frequent stealer third in the conference in steals is BJ Edwards and he takes that steel to the cup for an SMU lead yeah and Ive mentioned before I think that cross is going to be a big XA factor for this team I think BJ Edwards is the other big X Factor hes so good defensively when he scores and plays with the confidence hes been playing with this team again has a completely different level they can go to hin cut off knocks outside the ark against Miller Fades and fires way off on the three and here comes Edwards for SMU up to Miller Mustangs love to run Miller adjusting trayor is there for the follow yeah they put so much pressure on the rim you try to block a shot there then the man that went to block the shot trayor is not wide open for a easy put back and dont blink lots of shots being put up early and Walker ties it up just Daven Walker becomes the fourth different Alabama State Hornet to hit from three yeah they have green light coach wants to be able to stretch it he knows thats a big key for them in this game theyre four of nine from three SMU is 0 for one turnover here and a chance for Alabama state to take the advantage its Knox floating Baseline good and the harm oh my goodness that rainbow with a pot of gold at the end and the foul on trayor here you see transition again going the other way fakes the three hits him with the float but coach said this game is so important to not only win for their preconference record but to also make sure all of the puzzle pieces are together before they play Virginia in just a few days thanks so much Bri but Alabama State brings a different uh you know task obviously they are a team that gets up and down the floor with ease weve seen that so far and SMU has not always responded perfectly to it yeah Alabama states done a great job you have to play well in the first 4 minutes and almost win that first 4minute game if you want to give yourself a chance on the road against a team thats talented here they come back with the Zone but they already have five more shots in the SMU six second chance points and theyve made four threes theyve executed on all levels against the Zone boy Miller a wide open three but miss is over the top and Shan fure crouches in for the rebound Hornets actually out rebounding SMU right now also Off the Bench Tyler Mack Lofts the three comes up short Miller in transition sets up Chuck Harris he has six points from 15500 coming into the game and scores his first two with the lefthanded Fly To The Hoop yeah I love that Chuck Harris took it to the rack in the beginning didnt settle for a three even though hes terrific at making threes he went and got an easy layup that gets a score going so keep an eye on chug Harris filling up again outside the ark Tyler Mack takes a lot of Threes And he splashes another one home now 31 of his 33 shots this year have been three thats his 14th make Matt cross comes back with a three of his own but misses over the top Alabama state with a fourpoint lead and the ball well the thing this does too is it makes SMU have to play a little more on their heels because theyre coming from behind versus controlling a lead again great job driving the close out a lot of uh scattered bodies not knowing whos match up with who and a great job wasting no time on a good to Great pass for a corner three Tyler m the transfer from Maryland Eastern Shore knocking down the three and becoming the fifth player for Alabama state with the three so far in fact five of their six makes from the field have been from outside the ark that is a recipe for an upset for sure meanwhile Alabama states been changing up the defense a little bit the last few times up the floor they want to slow down The Possession foru make them have to work the clock a little bit more smart decisions again good coaching strategy the thing about this SMU team though you have to be able to play against them for the full 40 minutes because they are so talented Chuck Harris the up fake earning foul shots as he got down into the trees and Deontay bass is whistled for the foul and the infield sees Chuck Harris go to the line yeah again another interior shot by Chuck he took the shot before that probably thought he got hit got an offensive rebound stayed with it again you get a score to get a easy layup now hes going to the free throw line this is what scores do so well and when Chuck Harris is one of those guys hes can fill up quick and in a hurry hes like a microwave Off the Bench some people like ovens some people like crockpots this guys a microwave no he is I know people are into air fryers these days but Chu car is even faster than an air fryer goes two for two that trip four four points for Harris two points away from 1500 in his career playing in career game number 125 this game starting to settle in a little bit after a hectic pace to get things started pulling up from three Micah Simpson left unguarded and misses off the rim and here comes Edwards as a menty Take the Lead how about the lead out of the corner and yes its good for Caro o quindo he unleashes the hair and unleashes a three yeah the thing that Bri kind of mentioned as this team is starting to roll at all cylinders it took zero decision making for yogu to kick that out to his shooter in the corner SMU with the advantage and then Chuck Harris comes out with the rebound off the Miss by fure here come the Mustangs looking for more cross step back three bottoms and cross gives a little I gotcha to the Alabama State bench after that triple SMU on a run and with the fourpoint lead yeah I love the way smus sharing the basketball again they have so many offensive weapons so many thousand Point scorers on this team so many guys that have averaged double figures when they share it on the offensive end boy are they tough to stop its an 80 run for SMU Simpson turning the corner pull up from the Baseline doesnt go SMU looking to grow their advantage and their run chck Harris for 1500 you bet it Chuck Harris gets it done early tonight his triple gives him 151 points for his career telling you hes one of those guys on the Scout report you Circle and say dont let him get going early cuz if he gets going he starts to cooking Chuck Harris helping lead an 110 run for SMU pulling up and nailing the three Mustangs on in front but he was uh outstanding at Old Miss as an associate head coach he was also at Memphis did a great job with Penny Hardaway um theyre having a great year now and now he gets his chance to coach his son and hes coached him at two different institutions started at South Carolina state and then had so much success there so quickly Alabama State said hey we want you over here hes parked here since then Deontay bass left unguarded for three and knocks down is fifth of the Year bass a guy that they were going to give some space to but he makes him pay as well yeah I think its a strategy they want to be able to really have have their forwards take threes because the SMU bigs are going to stay closer to the paint in many situations and for Alabama State the six different player to knock down a triple it also breaks that 110 SMU run yeah great job again kind of getting lost wide open look theyre going to take those whether theyre open or barely open theyre going to take a lot of Threes a big part of their game plan fun fun fact about Coach badlock as his son gets the steal and finishes with the dunk early in my career I was at abene Christian and was looking um to get on at Lamar University well coach Matlock got the job the first time he was in between coach Matlock was so good then he got hired to another job and I always thank him for that because he left when he did I got to follow on his footsteps at Lamar under coach tick priceon uh the rest his history but great job again this young man does all the things for this club and talking to his dad before the game he said yeah there were some people that wanted him to get in the portal but luckily I got a little more over them than than what they had to offer you know Im still dead absolutely love that you know there are some kids who want to play for Dad some dads who want to coach their son and then some who dont you know that and thats interesting thats probably an interesting decision that you have to make as a family as you know a young man or a young woman is getting older and getting toward College AG yeah you see more and more college coaches having their sons whether theyre at a high level their sons may be a walk on or and be a part of the program uh we saw Mark Fon get introduced to college basketball earlier this season if you remember that highlight dunk that he was a part of on the other side uh obviously we see Dion and his sons just had senior day and what an incredible job theyve done out there a lot of Father and Son Duos we had Rob lanir and his son last year here at SMU so it does happen often coach Matlock says its been amazing to have this experience and he wouldnt trade it for the world when it goes well it really is heartwarming as a threepointer by G it doesnt go down but attacking the rebound you get toou finding his own Miss and CET yigu who is starting to really become an aggressive rebounder early in his SMU career goes to the line yeah well theyve been talking about him rebounding Above the Rim and his activity level on the glass in that particular play you saw him rebound and run the rim the only part I would add to it is if he keeps it high and doesnt bring it down they dont even have a chance for that luckily they did call that foul sometimes though when a big man is hit his size and his length because hes so physical and stature anyway they dont call some of those fouls when you bring the ball out so he just continues to get better and better we talked about his double double his first one of his career hes been close but hes just continuing to get more comfortable in the game hes so wellrounded hes not just a guy whos going to score for you and rebound we saw a pass earlier theyre working on him being a better uh rim protector and not maybe getting in some of those foul trouble and uh but again this this young man is one of the best freshman in the country and what an incredible upside he has two for two that Music trip and IGA comes out for trayor and nobodys in foul trouble now for SMU just one team foul for the Mustangs here Midway through the first half and you see there Alabama state is about to put SMU in the bonus nine team fouls the Mustangs with a little bit of a trap but a pull up three open Off the Mark by kiago and SMU gets a chance to run theyre good at this Harris in transition and double figures with 10 wow what a start for Chuck Harris telling you when he gets going that microwave just gets hotter and hotter and transition pull up threes the basket gets bigger and bigger for a guy like that when he sees the ball go in careful the popcorns going to burn if you leave it in there too long kiago gets cut off fouled by poopy Miller and SMU fans are saying burn baby burn burn baby burn in transition the onew pullup no hesitation the hand is up but its too late you dont know who I am Im number three this is what I do smell that what The Rock is cooking popcorn man Z quendo takes a blocking foul looked like he was in the charge Circle as TJ madlock went to the hole and madlock who will attack the glass on you goes to the line I mean just a physical specimen attacking the glass such a power guard again we talked about it already he leavs this team in rebounding he leads this team in assist hes one of the leading scores hes the leader in steals what doesnt he do and thats the stuff that they need from this team we talked about in the keys SMU has to defend without fouling you have to keep a team like this off the foul line because when they make threes and they make free throws it puts a ton of pressure on you defensively to figure out how to stop them so so far Alabama state has been able to execute their formula on the offensive end now is trying to figure out can they get a few more stops against this talented offensive team madlock the preseason swack First Team all conference member with seven so far Alabama State hanging in there only down by six heres Kio o quendo teams been good since hes been out there out to gner only five to shoot now Harris had it Sav back inbounds by the official takes the Deep three it did hit the rim and SMU collects bopy Miller gets a look and rims it out and on the rebound foul goes on SMU and a push Applause yeah I mean those are the looks you want maybe not the one from Chuck but hes already been hot first Miss um from downtown of the day so good job getting on the glass maybe a little too physical but again give credit to B state for how theyre scrapping on the glass as an undersized team and now the part for SMU is can they start getting their defensive intensity that we saw against Washington State it kicked in in the second half in that game are they going to be able to kick that in in the second half of the first half if you didnt get lost in the half no Im Im with it Im with it only gave up 60 points to Washington State pulling back and nailing the three Amar Knox he kills the bottom scorer and defensive disruptor hes got nine to lead Alabama State a quendo left unguarded he responds with a three of his own yeah I think its big for a quindo they talked about how much they want him to kind of increase his defensive intensity but boys hes starting to really make shots and just gives you another added scoring weapon going up against KN or rather cross Knox on the Miss offensive rebound we have a tie ball SMU wanted an up and down or travel there instead its going to be a tie ball between cross and justan Walker Alabama State still hanging in there under eight minutes to play in the first half as thats from all different positions on the floor uh its been fun to watch both teams put on this type of shooting playay John yeah youre a meteorologist when it comes to basketball and you told me theres a 70 chance of Threes tonight youre right of rain its been raining yes it has been raining what can I say theres a foul on SMU you see the threepoint looks there seven for Alabama State SMU with five made three boy Miller gives it up to Harris hes already got two comes up just short on this one long rebound out to mikah Simpson both these teams want to get out and run if you just joined us you have joined a really fun basketball game it has been up and down so far from Dallas at Moody Coliseum SMU leads the alltime series 31 against Alabama State hiago for the Triple and cross who leads the team in rebounding right now at seven a game Skies to grab that one well I think the thing is also been fun to watch in this game is the way that these teams have shared the ball 11 assists in a game already going both ways and just a lot of unselfishness a lot of creating for your teammate and that produces great basketball on both sides the difference in the game has been the foul line the size Advantage hasnt necessarily paid his dividends with points in the paint for um abama State they struggled in that category whereas meanwhile SMU has dominated the paint and also has dominated the free throw line so the 11th and 12th attempt here that was the second Miss of the game meanwhile Alabama state is only been to the line three times yeah kiago picking up this latest foul his second and the 10th team foul so SMU shoots two for the 702 remaining in the first half Yan trayor getting another start today misses on both these foul shots again he had started this season so well at the line at 75 smus best scoring run an 110 run to take an eightpoint lead ASU had a lead as many as four Simpson likes this switch against yatu but gives it up to Amar Knox who has started hot Knox way over the top thats him you all well the idea was good because he took the attack because yo was guarding a guard on the perimeter gave it up tried to attack but credit to boy Miller and then you forgot oh yeah theres a another almost sevenfooter in the game yoan treor comes over and he can he walls up and makes him Miss he didnt have to get the block shot but he forced to miss which got to stop well Tony madlock knew that smus athleticism and their versatility and their length it was going to be tough in this one so far SMU with a sixpoint lead cross makes it an eightpoint advantage as he cleans up the boopy Miller Miss I mean its just you got to give shout out to the headband again I dont know if he I dont know if he finishes that as well without the headband but because of the headband kept his hair intact he can see it put it in love the effort by cross now cross already with seven points and he is also pulling down boards with regularity four rebounds for Matt cross catch and shoot three by Mack and he reigns one home six points for Tyler Mack a couple threes thats one of those where you look over at the B and say coach you want me to guard him all the way out there offensive that goes on Matt cross and for making a three on one end oo Tyler Mack took a shot on the other end yeah again speak to the grittiness of the culture of this program theyre skilled offensively makes the three contested with deep range and then on the same exact counter possession takes a charge got a little bit of a a punishment because uh cross is a pretty physical guy so he had to stay on the floor for a little bit but this Alabama State team continues to hang around I just love the makeup of this team there are so deep another three as Tyler Mack extends the range and rainbows one in his third triple speaking of deep he said you thought the last one was let me show you another one boopy 0 for five from outside but trayor lays it in for SMU yeah I love that part of trys game he has been on the offensive glass he is such an elite athlete hes so talented and gifted at finishing that is a place where he will be able to make an impact not only in this game but in any game they play in the in the ACC SMU containing that fourpoint lead despite the nine made threes already by Alabama State the Hornets are on Pace to shoot about 503s in this game madlock against yigu dislodged Edwards comes up with it Edwards running the floor looks it off to cross for the reverse yeah thats the one thing this Alabama State team doesnt do a lot of they only turn it over 10 times a game and the two that theyve turned it over in this game have led to easy baskets and just fuels this high powered Mustang offense both these teams are typically really good fast break teams but you know if you dont turn it over tough to get those fast break buckets Walker open for three hes way off in an offensive rebound and another look for Mack he is red hot this time off the Applause heel DJ Edwards been on a heater the last three games yigao good spin two hand pass prayor Miller Edwards slices dices it up to cross he spins into the lane good movement Miller Another set shot for Three cross comes up with the offensive rebound yigu has the advantage inside and delivers great pass inside and great ball movement that entire possession mixed with the extra effort on the glass but that post move is exactly what the staff has kind of been talking to the big freshman about out is just sometimes you just got to keep it simple catch turn and finish you dont have to make a bunch of moves at this level you already have the advantage reestablishes the 8point lead for SMU matches their largest step back three madlock to keep his team in it over the top Here Comes boy Miller long pass ahead Edwards lays it home on the full court heave by Miller Distributing again timeout called by Alabama state with SMU extending the lead out to 10 thanks to f great buckets well we talked about the buckets weve talked about it raining but its also a track that you were talking about earlier Brian thank you so much Bri and Amar Knox a three star guard coming out of Bartlett High School in Memphis and so he was a Memphis guy Tony madlock really familiar with him of course his son TJ familiar with him as well originally a Memphis commit but uh got him to come to Alabama State and boy he is going to be a big part of Alabama states quest for a championship in the swack this year absolutely I mean weve talked about how important a shot making is and hes obviously a guy that not only can make threes but just can score and fill it up so you need those kind of players that are not afraid to play in big games on big stages and still perform CJ hin back in the lineup playing really really well the swack player of the week he didnt miss the last game against Cincinnati with an illness but but in the akan tournament he had 15 against Omaha he had 24 against Lamar he had 19 against akan he hit three threes in all three of those ball games hes trying to get back into the Rhythm after missing a game yeah rare two misses there back to back and coming back to a two3 Zone hoping that they can steal a possession SMU is only 5 of 15 from outside maybe induce SMU into a few more of those shots a quendo will take a three off to the right and the rebound chase down out last touch by Alabama State 20 to shoot it for SMU and they have picked up their ninth offensive rebound of night and a quindo is a guy as they get into ACC play again he scored 15 points a game in Georgia in the SEC then hes been in the NCA tournament played at uh excuse me organ where he was a double figure scorer as well hes a guy thats going to be able to really be an important part of this team as well that with so many talented players you almost forget to celebrate each one of them because theres so many uh options and what they call an embarrassment of riches here at SMU when it comes to guys they can score its going to be so fun to see how SMU lines up against teams from the ACC they get that shot zatu one over the top against Ambrose Hilton there and throws it out of bounds a rare turnover for SMU but Andy enfields team has been building toward ACC play in Virginia coming up on Saturday thats going to be a 115 start central time on the CW as SMU makes their debut in ACC action well I think very similar to what youve seen from other sports in this University and what theyve done SMU is going to be a big surprise in the ACC with all the talent on his roster and with a well coached experienced staff whos done this before at USC good defensive play by Tyler Mack knocking it out of crosss hands in transition Knox Retreats for three hard off the heel Knox are not a great threepoint shooter just 22 over the course of his career he has knocked down a couple in this game SMU controlling an eightpoint advantage Edwards basine Edwards trying to wrap around to pass does it himself instead with the baby hook eight points for BJ Edwards Edward talking it even this St before the game he just has this like Fast slow medium thing thats like you dont really know when hes going to accelerate when hes a not and on that POS possession he was looking to pass it but then said all right well I just shoot this reverse layup and makes it pass outside the AR 4 three and you talk a lot about deceleration and that being one of the key things you look for in a great guard yeah I mean CH playing at different speeds is so important and you dont want a guy who can only go at one speed and the change of speed and Pace allows you to make better decisions a quendo to the bucket for two plus a fou as well Carrio Endo close out a little too strong and Endo takes it right to the r i mean just a power guard you ran into his shoulder he didnt run into you you ran into him and shout out to the SMU football team this young man is explosive enough he can play just about any position on the field and he brings that skill level he brings that power he haded top 10 sports center dunk the first uh opening game here at SMU Moody see him got the fans on their feet and everyone excited and then hes like hey I dont always just dunk I got skill to I make threes I put people on the floor I get n ones you know thats what I do and now hes a little bit more in his rhythm hes got four straight games now in double figures after a little sputtering stretch for games two through five of the season and hes got and hes got his hair out so you dont even always recognize him hes got different versatility when he comes to that to love it under minute to play in the first half SMU largest lead at 13 Alabama State needs to make a shot here at the end of the half for some confidence something to build on going to the break vulture nowhere to go nearly turn it over Fades and fires the three and thats the 10th make of the first half by Alabama State definitely something they needed going into the half to just hang around that 10point margin dont want to let it get more than that SMU spends their use it or lose it timeout the remainder of because SMU is so good at scoring you got to be able to get some more stops and still make those threes Im scared more than three4 of their points coming from Beyond The Arc right now 30 of their 39 points little trap up top as Edwards wraps it around for Harris thought about the open deep three but he knows he has some time still 5 Seconds Harris extra pass Edwards another extra Pass open three rounded off at the end of the half by Keon Ambrose Hilton SMU got a perfect look but goes into the break with a 10point lead especially considering Alabama state made those 10 threes that is pretty outstanding hard to beat a team thats like you said Brian is doubling you in rebounds SMU with 30 Alabama state with 16 but on the other end I did bring up their 10 threes and he said with a big smile on his face you cant be mad about that thank you so much Banna senson along with Brian Burton Im John little foul called against Alabama State its on yubang okon who picks up his third one interesting factoid of the first half okay Alabama state only turned it over twice and we talked so much about how SMU thrives off live ball turnovers despite that fact SMU still has 18 fast break points thats the long misses from three right that thats SMU doing what SMU does well when theyre doing it well I mean this team we talked about earli they they fast break on a make the same way they do on a Miss sometimes because they get it out they play so fast so I think a lot of it is just the misses period and the trans and defense because of how Alabama State wants to space you and then they take those threes it benefits in offensive rebounds but it also doesnt benefit you sometimes in getting back SMU top 40 in the nation in Fast Break points a game at 15 and a half theyve already got 18 and thats already the third foul on Alabama State this one on TJ M the same possession is 15 seconds every 5 Seconds they C the foul which means theyre headed to fouling into the bonus and you hate that because you know foul trouble hurts you even more when youre already at a talent disadvantage on the road trying to make a comeback down by 10 obviously really held in there as Alabama State met Yu thought about the three I got some hoops and hollers going throughout the Moody Coliseum floor trayor does try a three out of the corner and the rebound poked out last touched by SMU so many times you see bigs that can pass when theyre facing the basket but y yugu has an ability to be back to the basket and turn over his shoulder and see the whole floor and hes made two different passes from the post into the opposite corner very impressive for the big fella and his feel and vision for the game hes a plus 12 in his time on the floor today SMU up by 10 no points on that opening possession for SMU despite the three fouls but they get a takeaway only the third turnover Miller in transition lining up that three hes 0 for seven from outside DJ Edwards nearly coming up with a steal H off the top of the glass cross comes out with it the Mustangs want to run trayor in transition up FL I mean the track shoes we havent talked about smus track team but many of these young men could easily be on that Squad uh in all respect to the track team of course but these are some Elite running athletes when it comes to playing in transition and you mentioned booby Miller hasnt scored maybe the way hes has has wanted to or usually does just come off the he came off the MVP of the last tournament that SMU played in and had the game winner in the opening round which could have been a lost and that was a big play and you know this guys going to show up when it matters he does so much for this team on a poor shooting night theyre still up the number that theyre up says a lot about the collection of Talent on this team here you see again running in transition takes his time and doesnt just lay it up that was the one thing talking to one of the staff members Jeremy Hart we want the big fella to dunk with more Authority when he gets those opportunities Edwards in the paint hell have a chance to go to the line to shoot to Meanwhile VY Miller you know you talk about how he hasnt scored but he does have four assists and SMU had coach Andy Enfield assistant coach KT Carris who we T to this week they think boy Miller is at his best when hes a facilitator and right now hes second best in the conference in assists per game at almost six I mean thats the thing about you know talking to the young man I dont know him personally but from talking to him doing enough of these games and then watching him play what he cares about most is winning yeah hes a guy whos a competitor he wants to win he can impact the game with his scoring absolutely but he definitely can impact with his leadership his defense and just getting his teammates involved all he cares about why he came here he wanted to win and thats what hes been able to lead this team to do so far madlock cant hit but a rare offensive rebound and stick back for davien Walker who got his first start of the Season hes got five points Edwards has been good smooth inside blocked from behind by Walker SMU keeps it with 18 to shoot well theyve had some foul trouble for The Bigs uh the both starting four and five they havent had the opportunity to be on the flooor but when they are they have a similar height when it comes to their four and five ASU they actually match up pretty well sizewise and even physicality wise they just havent been able to play because theyve been in fou Miller the niy scoop couldnt get it to go you got toou trying to turn back in and Walker picks up his fourth foul its kind of one of those where its like because theyre able to get the offensive rebounds thats whats hurting him its not the first shot but its the second and because what they talked about with uh yugu being able to go after those rebounds Above the Rim that one wasnt quite Above the Rim but because hes making that a habit hes doing a great job on the offensive glass its just such a hard guy to block out good news for Alabama State and maybe a little bit of a fortunate call as Micah Simpson is the one called for the foul his second forunate thats a definite fortunate definitely a fortunate they dont want Walker getting for it thats for sure U with five one for two trip SMU as a team shot 13 of 13 from the foul line in the second half against Washington State in that come from behind effort for the championship threepointer out of the corner comes up short no made threes in the second half so far for Alabama State the Mustangs up by 12 Edwards eatu turns away theres the flush yeah just so many options on this offense youre worried about the shooters youre worried about this and that and there you see to bigman on a high low theres no backside help great pass great dunk great finish SMU with a steady start to the second half establishing their largest lead thanks to the high low look the Mustangs up by Music 14 theyre shooting a ton of Threes the analytics are saying thats the way to go so a big man doesnt always have that Advantage whereas in college the defensive 3 seconds is not a rule so even defensively that helps you a ton and then theres not as many human beings that have that kind of height and size in college basketball but I will say this people thought Zack Edy wasnt going to be great in the NBA and boy he already been awesome for Memphis Im not saying you to zachi but he has some of that same ingredients and there you see another one in transition boy Miller said you cant keep me down long you dont know who I am Im number two I do this its another bucket come on we in transition you trying to get the Steal This is an n one this my house is the eighth leading scorer in the ACC right now and thats his first bucket of the game and SMU has a 16point lead which tells you something about the depth of this mustang Squad yeah and I think Ive said it before I I have no problem saying it on record multiple times he is one of the best point guards in the country because he defends he can make plays he can make threes hes a big time gamer when game is on the line and it matters most and theres not really a lot of weakness with that young man and hes proven he can do it and put it in the books and now he has so many talented weapons around him hes excited hes connected with his staff him and infield have a great relationship thats why he came here because he believed in the vision and he wanted to start this SMU program and get back to a city hes a shy Town guy hes back in the city in dtown and has some family near Dallas in mosqu just off to the east good post to Post Feed and you got puts Walker on a poster oh my goodness even he had to get a big grin I think his forearm was Above the Rim on that big fella showing his bounce inside and those kind of plays that give you a grin like that definitely gives you a little sample of the upside of that young man youu looks hungry to make a big impact Walker out of the corner over the top and tror comes down to the board hoopy Miller scooping and again its yigu flying through the lane to lay it home the motor for this young man not just the size but he has Mobility he can run he can move hes light on his feet and he is very cordinated with his skill level to be able to be almost falling out of bounds and get that tip in love his effort on the glass as much as anything about his game and SMU taking over in the second half of this game oo coming up limping and giving it up for a three is madlock KN hits the three but some concern for TJ madlock as he comes up limping on the play and has to hobble out of the game much needed triple for Alabama state with SMU up big Music and making sure many different hands score the ball and when you have those Dynamic guards like boopy Miller and BJ Edwards you can get down the court and it opens the floor for so many players to score and right now we can see the Mustangs implementing that sharing mentality for players with double digits and two almost there with nine points thank you so much B and five times this year already SMU has had five or more players in double figures theyre about to do it again five to shoot here cross lcks the three and hits it Matt cross becomes the fifth player in double figures right on Q just when you thought you could take away the paint they send you a reminder oh you thought we couldnt shoot let me show you something great job executing against the Zone 34 to four in the paint and now makes their 6 of the game SMU pretty nice 38 from outside this year thats third best in the ACC Amar Knox hes having the game of his life from outside that is his fourth made triple yeah hes a bucket getter sometimes when youre a scorer like I said you get those first ones to go in and basket starts getting a lot larger you start feeling a lot better speaking of ooh the heat check cross one for another one on line but a little bit long hind leaning into the lane and the foul goes on SMU he get Edwards on the way by with the chop and thats only the first team foul on SMU in the second half and the first foul on BJ Edwards all night as Chuck Harris comes in the game for the first time in the second half he had a very efficient 10point effort in the first half and surged over 1500 points for his career well I mentioned this earlier in the game game when you play against a team like SMU and theres firep power you can have spurts where you feel good about how you play but you have to be able to stop them and slow them down for an entire 40 minutes and they have 65 with right at 14 minutes to play theyre on Pace for another 100 point game at the rate that theyre scoring the basketball and theyre in the bonus the rest of the way SMU with a big height advantage in this one theyve taken advantage of that now to a 4022 plus 18 on the boards and were early in the second half tur quickly to the glass EO is trying to jam it again this time Walker fouls him and yigu goes to the line this man looks starving inide well this is kind of what you talked about you asked the question of him getting better confidence in game with game minutes hes gotten a couple of dunks he got a dunk that was a poster now hes doing it from a drop step in Traffic oneonone Defender again the more he has success in games and the more he plays hes just going to get more and more confidence and he is a guy people say okay youre doing this against a non ACC opponent well youre going to get a chance to see this young man in plenty of ACC contest hes going to look no different than what he looks tonight because the things that hes doing translates against the best players in the world because of his talent and maybe hes not an outside player but what does it say that and you can still go up and down the floor to the level they can with him on the floor its not like he cant run the floor as inside the lane CJ hin leans in SMU can still do what they want to do with him on the floor even though hes not a stretch five if you will no absolutely but hes a mobile five hes a guy who can run he can jump he can play Above the Rim he has great feet great hands he can move with the best of and again thats a reason why he might not see a fouryear career here at SMU that as he continues to get better because he does have that upside for the next level and meanwhile BJ Edwards the evolution of this young mans game hes already been a defensive stopper hes already been a playmaker but his scoring is so impressive in the variety of ways that number zero is able to score at The Rim midrange from three the craftiness and great response there from State yeah knocks up to 17 Edwards has 11 thats his fourth straight double figure game and he has just really become a score this year for SMU averaging double figures Edwards not hungry from three but he will take the open ones this one knock back in bounds nicely by Max to start a transition opportunity for hindes tie ball and the jump ball possession arrow favors Alabama state after Chuck Harris stuck his hand in yeah on that one hindes you got to go over great Hustle but if you go below and pick this up that low guards are going to grab at it fortunately he got the jump ball favor but one of those small things that you often see NBA players in transition they rarely ever have the ball low they always pick it up high but meanwhile going back to SMU just really putting together an outstanding performance of another 40ish minutes its not there yet but theyre on Pace to play a full game worth of playing hard and competing and you think about Alabama State they had good 25 points by the Midway point of the first half but theyve been you know pretty well shut down ever since as SMU has gotten better and better defensively as the game has gone on colber picks up his first foul to Sten Walker to the line and Walker making his fifth career start averaging Five Points three rebounds a game this season and getting his first start of the Year 610 red shirt sophomore forward out of Oakland Tennessee and a nice player for Tony madlock to have in his bag to bring either Off the Bench or in the starting row yeah hes going to be a terrific player when he gets the C play his size and bounciness and his skill level to go with it hell be a great weapon and you know the second halfs been tough for Alabama State mainly because of foul trouble a lot oh it goes in for TI gorer It was supposed to be a back door alley L for a quendo but its a threepointer hes such a good shooter he couldnt even help himself he passed it into the rim unbelievable to B gner his 43 of the Season 178 in his career Colbert comes away with the block Here Comes Endo one on Three Endo he gets the champ time hey I tried to get the lob I couldnt get it cuz you made it but Ill go ahead and get a steal and get one myself such a highlight reel when he is able to get some daylight in the lane Knox turns the corner hes had a great one extra pass threepointer by kiago that comes off Mendo with a dozen points one of six Mustangs and double fingers backhanded Lam as he goes all the way to the glass they just didnt stop the ball yeah hes a baller hes going to be a big part of this offensive attack and defensive bigger guard who can just play small ball at the four he can be a big guard and be explosive and use his skill hes going to be a big asset for ACC play good defensive play by gner not fouling on the smaller knocks a quendo hes on a heater and has seven in a row by himself hes on fire 0er to 100 real quick this young man came in heating it up again we talked about all the scho scoring options he is another one of the bucket Getters on this squad doesnt do it the same way as the other guys he doesnt dribble as much he doesnt have all the fancy moves but boy is he effective in filling up the stat sheet when it comes to scoring heres another one 10 straight Carrio my scoring son hes going into Mama mode hes wearing number eight and hes got the throw it only Mak sense John can Max stop the bleeding no and a foul on Alabama State and I think he may be going to the free throw line to go with it Cara quendo the hammer the threes this man is Unstoppable in Dallas be confident they have to believe it and that comes with putting time in the gym repetition after repetition and thats exactly what Cario has done put in the hard work and hes starting to see that success SMU is on a 130 run and Bri like you mentioned Kio endo on a 100 burst all by his Lonesome to help SMU take a 30point lead is unreal so get this man the ball oh he he had already dunked it before he had caught it they got it to him yeah they did he had to show he was a a little bit human at the rate he was going barely I mean this is a guy think he was a Transformer or something or maybe like uh he drank some of his space cam juice at half time so hes a Music monstar its got to be the hair quendo called for the foul here and Simpson heads to the line yeah I love stories like a COO because he hes a Cho product anybody that understands Cho basketball and having to get it out the mud as they say played his freshman year in junior college at Florida Southwestern then moved on to Georgia average 15 a game at Georgia as a s sophomore and averag 18 in SEC play with a career high 33 versus Texas AM so hes no stranger to scoring buckets weve talked so much about the guards he hasnt had that Breakout game at SMU yet but what a perfect time going in the ACC play for opponents to have to now think about the fact that not only K he done it before but hes done it in this uniform now and SMU there are so many players you got to prepare for how long is that Scouting Report going to be for these ACC teams as they get ready for SMU I they got to go 10 Deep right I love that question they may have to go more than 10 Deep if you look at this roster cuz Cobert is a guy right there we havent talked about but he plays crucial minutes because they think he has a chance to be as they told us early in the year a defensive Player of the Year type of player in this league as he gets older and they use him in a lot of situations to be able to defend and hes a guy thats not even in the top necessarily 10 players that have played in this game so far yeah but you look at his production when hes on the floor hes blocking shots hes got 11 blocks to lead the team and he is only playing about 10 minutes a game yeah a lot of weapons on this roster 10 Deep for sure with a couple Asters steel live ball turnover Harris in transition off the glass and no the follow is not going to count it was in the cylinder for Colbert your man getting after it and almost had a follow dunk Houston Texas stand up lets go Young fella great job again running the floor this time hes trailing so dangerous because they have so many scores but theyre so good on the offensive glass so much athleticism so much motor that is a huge asset for this team that one didnt count but you can still see the makings of what this team could be quindo called for the foul again as vulture is able to make it down the lane after the crossover lay it home and one he was a starting point guard at Buffalo last year yeah beautiful job splitting the ball screen there yeah hes a double I mean right at eight points a game at Buffalo the unfortunate part for Alabama state is we havent seen coach Matt Locks son TJ mat Lu back on the bench he went out with a little bit of an injury earlier with thoughts and well wishes with him that hopefully nothing too serious and he has a speedy recovery you know if theres one place that Alabama state is a little bit deep its at that guard spot but hes an invaluable part of this team no doubt the most valuable player on this Alabama State roster and absolutely Echo your sentiments want to make sure hes okay for the rest of the season thats some youre taking over in the second half leading by 10 at the break they led by as many as 30 here in the second half Ambrose Hilton short Corners gets the smaller Ked up this time cber delivers its about the red reduction red redungeon tour right now I like that meaning guys that had dunks that got taken away come back and said I dont care if you taken away Im taking my dunk anyway and we call it reduction were just making up worse here in M Coliseum back to dunk again fer knocks it out of Harriss hands Harris on the Fly by fouls kiago and that means foul shots a one and one on the way with 718 left in the second half for Alabama State all the Mustangs theyre hitting threes theyre dunking two those are some of the dudes that get it done right there as you look at the little notes what comes to mind for you John I think this team does it in a lot of different ways you know the fact that they get up and down the floor they share the basketball and they get after the offensive glass A lot of times you see a team you think of a big bruising team that gets after the offensive glass well this is an athletic team that gets after the glass and can share the basketball I I love that about this team cuz theyll have high scoring games and then youre going to win games where they just grind it out too yeah and at the end of the day your job is to score more points than the other team theres a lot of ways you can do it but when scoring comes as easy as it does and offensive rebounds those things are a recipe for Success they do it inside they do it outside um yeah its going to be exciting to see what this team can accomplish and I talked about it heres number 11 player not the number 11 player in the roster but the number 11th player to enter the game today and immediately almost has a highlight of his own no rim protector in there for Alabama State and AJ George attacking Baseline transfer from Long Beach State to put his mark on this game and definitely provides some length at the three4 spot for SMU whenever they need it yeah just some more bals another athlete and another skill guy who can step out and make it three as well mat does not normally play inside the threepoint line nearly gave it away Alabama State able to keep a hold of it with under seven to play George on the D dish off only 10 to shoot Simpson now against cobbert attacking the shot blocker and losing it poopy Miller two1 two drops it off trayor adjusting and going to the line I mean how many times do you see a two onone fast break with your 7footer 611 running the floor with you impressive by treor when his motor is going again he is a dangerous part of this talented team weve talked so much about all the different things but you know his athleticism mixed with his skill his size his strength his gives you another player to put more pressure on the rim not only just in the half court but but in transition he is so good at running the floor he might be the fastest person on the team I dont know that for sure but if they line up and race it Id be curious to ask the coach you wouldnt be surprised if he won would you those long strides one of two trips so for SMU they opening up conference flavor with Virginia all right I dont know if there are two more diametrically opposed di I like that I like in I dont know what it means but I said it in the ACC as dieago goes glass over cber for those at home that dont know what diametrically opposed means youre saying theyre almost virtually opposites in their style of play Absol Virginia is going to slow it down Virginia is one of the slowest paced teams in the nation SMU wants to get up and down the floor as fure wanted an n one slow it down maybe slow it down maybe an understatement they want to like play a little bit of a snails Place pace so what does SM need to do to make sure that Virginia plays more of their game cuz its so hard against the Cavaliers I think the biggest thing that SMU has done a good job of with this new roster this new team is focusing on them what do we need to do and I think the same thing applies as long we talked about it they they push on makes and misses so they may have to do some things to make Virginia play faster offensively on their side but as long as they keep playing with the pace that they can play with and if they can in any way build a lead it gets really hard for Virginia to play as slow as they want to when youre playing from behind Virginia is going to be coming off a game tomorrow on the road at Florida and thats going to be a tough one in the ACC SEC challenge there SMU is going to have an extra day off theyre not going to have to travel that really plays into smus favor but you know that defense in that uh grinded out game always travels for Virginia so its going to be a really interesting opener again thats 115 on Saturday afternoon part ofy a huge Saturday and a huge weekend when it comes to someu sports fans thanks to everything thats going on in fall and winter sports what is going fall and winter sports John Im glad you asked okay lets see if we can run it all down you got volleyball uh they are a number two seed in the NCAA tournament they are hosting a pod theyre taking on Witchita State uh taking on Witchita state Missouri and Texas State also a part of that on Thursday and then Thursdays game one Winner Takes on the game two winner on Friday to see who moves on to the Sweet 16 so thats thats one thing thats going on and Saturday is like the ultimate day of SMU athletics youve got the mens opener youve got in the ACC youve got the SMU mens soccer team in the Elite 8 the Elite 8 at home taking on Marshall amazing incredible and thats coming up at 600 C Central Time 700 eastern time number 12 SMU against number 13 Marshall Marshall the champions in the 2020 season of the college cup and then of course the ultimate in Charlotte with the SMU Mustangs football team now number eight in the cfp rankings facing Clemson in the ACC Championship game that night has it ever been better to be a Pony fan I would say what a time to be alive goodness gracious tell me about it its been unreal and SMU womens basketballs got a big game in the ACC SEC challenge at Missouri I believe thats tomorrow thats coming up too I mean theres a lot happening cant keep up with it all well this is what SMU fans wanted this is what the boosters wanted this is what the alumni wanted they wanted to be a to play at the highest level and they are now having opportunity and not only they having it but they are absolutely as I continue to say crushing it AJ George knocks down his first three off the assist by Boy Miller thats five dimes for Miller in this ball game SMU in control for most in the second half the Fade Away by fure doesnt fall and this is going to stay right here with Alabama State yeah I mentioned that about George I me we saw the almost dunk highlight the first time then he go goes to the line and gets almost has another one now he makes a three I mean this is a guy whos not even playing heavier in the rotation and you see his talent that He could help in any given game you have any kind of issues at the wing or the three spot uh with somebody going down AJ George is ready to come in and be an impact player vulture Fade Away doesnt fall Harris gobbles it in I mean you got this guy coming off the bench and embarrassing of riches he on Ambrose Hilton big Euro George attacks back off to Ambrose Hilton cant hit cobbert keeps it alive and culbert reaching in called for the foul on Mario Andrews and that sends Andrews to the line on the other side SMU running away with this matchup in Frisco which is just a little north of Dallas at the comer Center coming up on the 14th the game can see on ESPNU is its going to be LSU taking on the Mustangs in the SEC ACC match up there those two teams will match up again next year theyll do so in New Orleans Mario Andrews one of two from the line the transfer from sneeve Community College and Boaz Alabama SMU is led by as many as 30 in the second half on their way to this dominant looking margin John Little Brian Burton Banna senson and our whole crew from the ACC Network it has been a fun Tuesday night in Dallas to be gorner hes going Baseline out to George 10 toes to the rim three tips off Colbert fighting back up goes to the line for Applause two another one on kiago its his fourth yeah we mentioned it early in the half they got into the bonus and this is another part of what makes another element of this SMU team that they can put pressure on teams because of their physicality their athleticism their ability to score when they get into the bonus it gives them even more of an opportunity to score even more points and puts the other team in foul trouble and again they give them credit for the mission that they set out the nonconference season they wanted to get really good at playing hard for 40 minutes they felt like that Washington State game was a significant game especially having the near loss the day before or it had their attention and they responded you always want to see as a coach how are you going to respond to a challenge how are you going to respond to a situation and this team responded had an outstanding defensive effort in that game held him to 60 points and they are carrying that momentum over its not the total number of points but its the domination of this game and executing on all facets and especially in the second half and when we talk to coach Kurt Carris earlier this week what he talked about was its tougher to defend when youre not defending in front of your own bench right and keeping that together like on this end of the floor SMU did a great job defending second half against Washington State theyve done a great job defending tonight in the second half absolutely threepointer around and off for Ambrose Hilton but somehow cobbert just finds offensive rebounds they just stick to him like a magnet and Terell culber back to the line yeah some players have a knack of being able to track the basketball and he is not only good at tracking on the offensive glass but thats part of what makes him such a terrific shot blocker as hes able to track the ball as its being able to go up in the air again its been in LSU its been in Kansas State theres no doubt about the talent but this system and this team and this role hes embraced it so far and hes another one of the players on this team and you continue to see him get better as games go on so there two free throws give him a new career high 10 and in addition to that SMU has seven players with 10 or more points its the first time theyve had that in the last 20 seasons and may I mention this their leading score doesnt even have 10 in this game thats nuts so what youre saying is thats a good thing thats a really good thing you know its not just here say its not just F all that this SMU team is deep it is absolute Applause true yeah talking to the staff again before the game leading up to this theres a lot of similarities and we even asked the question of how does this feel compared to when you guys did this at USC youre starting at a higher point in some ways because you had a 21n season team that you inherited but they werent playing at the highest level so and it sounds like much of the makeup of what theyre doing and what theyre putting together with their track work of success at USC in the Pack 12 a lot of those ingredients carry over with this Team Ambrose Hilton raped as he heads through the lane by Deontay pass it gives Keon Ambrose Hilton a chance to go to the line you know Ambrose Hilton in his first couple seasons in an SMU uniform was almost exclusively a five but this season hes mainly playing a four spot driving from the threepoint line shooting threes how have you felt about this transition in Keon Ambrose Hiltons game well similar to BJ Edwards similar to some of the guys we talked about these are guys that started their career at another high major so he was recruited to play in the SEC didnt get a ton of minutes got recruited here Rob lir started getting more minutes and it was just about getting on the floor his motor such an asset for that team uh in the program last year and he had a breakout year last season but now you see him even getting more comfortable facing the basket shooting threes you see his relentlessness on the glass hes such a great defender um hes one of those guys that you need if youre going to really win in a in a longer season because he just brings so much that doesnt always show up in the stat sheet as well Sean pure and double figures the second Alabama State Hornet to get there and fure has done it a lot in his career thats the 13th time hes been in double figures again the transfer from Buffalo where he was the starting point guard last year SMU once a 100 gor gorer has the shot blocked but it falls right to Harris 101 for the SMU Mustangs yeah I mentioned it earlier this is another game back in the day they used to call it chalupas with the Mavericks if you got to 100 everybody got free chalupas I dont know if theyre doing that here on the hill but this team this is not the first time theyve scored a 100 they probably not used to having a promotion for that after they scored 100 the last time they probably should have went to him and said hey are we getting chalupas or what whats going on here I love that marketing opportunities abound all over SMU athletics for Applause sure SMU polishing off a big win at home over a very toughminded Alabama State team a team that is going to be a factor in swack play this year but the Mustangs just outlasting the Hornets out scoring them by 20 in the second half Harris off the bounce culbert not able to Wrangle it in fure playing off the spring with 5 Seconds attacking and going to the line with 44 no go ahead I want to hear what Im just going to say coming up after the game excited were going to talk to our player of the game I was just going to tease ahead a little bit I like to leave the people wanting more and they they want a little bit more Bree or Inson and maybe to hear from our player of the game as well well see who that ends up being little hint he went on a 10 run by himself in the second half it wasnt Brian Burton it was not me Ive done a lot of things with a o in it but it wasnt a 10 run today but Mr Mama mentality got that done want to tip our hat though best of success to both these teams as they go forward Alabama State great first half competitiveness put up 72 points on a really talented SMU team hopefully that their leading one of their leading players is not injured too badly and wish them well SMU goes to 72 with a 10172 win over Alabama States well hear from our player of the game on the other side well have highlights and stats as well after a win
