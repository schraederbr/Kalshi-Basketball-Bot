Brent Hampton Justin Porterfield and Jamal Spearman are our officials Brent Hampton set to toss it up and we are just about ready to go with game number two the cards first three games of the regular season here in the kfcm center theres sky Clark with the ball had a big dunk late in that game the other night their onepoint win over UNBC JJ trainer with the deciding basket with just about 8 seconds left lilles going to have to step it up tonight theyre going to have to play better especially on a defensive end and sky Clark looking like he was trying to get maybe was that a lob lets take a look at their starters real quick this is Michael Chade down the lane he is fouled Hunter Huff a transfer from VMI with Dan earler coach who transfer set out last year then Miles J a freshman from California Sam Alexis Tyler Millan transfer from Middle Tennessee and we have already talked about Yan zc who is a graduate transfer from Pepperdine that was Huff with a air ball three on the corner and Brandon Huntley HEI coming off a 10 rebound performance in the opener comes down with that one card same starting five we saw the other night in the opener Scott Clark Mike James 25 points 10 rebounds as we said Trey white Brandon Huntley Hatfield and Dennis Evans and Huntley Hatfield not a bad looking shot in the lane but hes aggressive on the defensive end like he was in the second half against UNBC and then goes to the basket hes going to have to play well tonight because of the size of some of these guys that you that Chattanooga has Che for the three in the corner from Tyler Miller and this team will fire up some threes their coach Dan Earl his teams always among the tops in the nation as we see Mike James said a three and thats something Jody in the opener Louisville only hit two and Mike James wasnt one of the two he did a good he did a good job of everything or the cards did a good job of some things not hitting threes in the open are two of 14 and they get their first one to go here tonight as you see sky Clark just finding James stepping back and burying that Mike James is a totally different player player this season for Louisville hes finally all the way healthy and in great great shape did everything but hit threes in that open Chattanooga manto man the cards the other night when UNBC played manto man they were able to get the basket pretty much at will thats how they scored 94 points without only hitting the two threes and shooting pretty poorly from the line too except for James three Sam Alexis the big fella knocks it down theyre going to shoot now they only hit eight in their opener but last year they averaged what 10 11 a game and thats pretty much been the recipe for Dan Earl throughout his career their head coach who well talk about through the course of the game in his second season at Chattanooga theyre going to fire it up and Alexis gets the first one to go down all so on freshman team last year for Alexis as Clark gets a good look and misses but Huntley Hatfield there for the offensive rebound and Dennis dunk is what we get right away great job job by Huntley Hatfield getting the offensive rebound and then right to Clark who saw Dennis Evans alone and has every basket hes got almost pretty much a dunk Conor Huff to the basket Evans had a chance to block it but couldnt quite get it and Huffs able to get that the smallest guy on the floor able to get the paint and score and we are all even at five here in the early going Hunley Hatfields got a major advantage down there with Huff but hes not in there posting up he wasnt first kind of gave up on it now James all the way to the basket throws it up gets it Applause back B knock had bounds be little the ball 7 seconds on the shot Applause clock Chattanooga led the nation in threepointers made per game last year 114 CL gets the shot off but cant hit it Alexis the rebound and here comes CH a lot of talking Louisville shoot around today just being patient on the offensive end and then on defense just making sure you know where guys are like that you dont leave them open for a three that missed one there by Mill boy Chay got in the lane looked up and saw Dennis Evans and thought better of it yeah Im not going to go against the 71 guy interesting to see how Trey white responds um Huntley Hatfield the aggressive move to the basket and Im not sure what that was when he got in there but it was half good Z it kind of goes into Huntley hat field but cant get the basket to go and still all even at five in the early going cards two for eight from the field now two for nine were going to get a jump ball possession arrow to Chattanooga with 1607 left to play here in the first half not a great start for either one of these teams as oh I guess they had already switched Im sorry they had already switched the position no no no no they had not its a jump ball they called it a jump ball I was going to okay Im not why everybody Im not sure why everybody went to this theyre all looking like theyre giving little the ball possession the three referees are saying the other way so theyre just all kind of looking around we now now they will switch the arrow its Jay takes it on the Baseline gets it right inside and James got beat to the basket there and thatll be Demetrius Davis who started in their first game but did not start tonight he has checked into the game for Millan Shay misses Alexis cant get it but zedek does zc in the paint he can finish his dad A Center on the UCLA National Championship team back in 1995 a first round NBA draft Pi the first first round NBA Draft pick from Czechoslovakia zic on the Czech Republic the team that won the uh that won a gold medal at the world championship games as sky Clark throws it away and Louisville a sloppy start for the cards just two for 10 and they Trail 75 conference and their mascot the scrappy mocking bird that is a bird foot that you see on their jerseys there you see their head coach Dan Earl he played at Penn State was a fouryear star there third all time and assists in Penn State history and I mentioned Chattanooga led the nation last year in threepointers made per game at 114 he was the coach at VMI two years ago they led the nation in three point threepointers made per game at 12 and a half so they are going to shoot some triples and found out of can guard him and on Q Yan zi with a three out of the timeout misses it but Trey white cant come up with the offensive rebound Chay does and he misses another one zedi another offensive rebound back out to Hunter Huff hell try the triple and the third time is the charm for the mocks they lead it 105 here in the early going Louisville two of 10 from the field and Louisville with Huntley Hatfield out of there he had gotten four rebounds for the cards and that time a COR for and trainer checking in the cards cannot come up with a rebound and thats going to be an offensive foul on JJ trainer as he tries to give Tyler Johnson the scream but uh he was moving as we see the the replay here Ken zi uh you always hear you know good time to get a three off an offensive rebound zi got a couple of them they got a couple tries and able to hit the second one there uh number 34 Randy Brady in the game for the mock setting that cards lineup Mike James Tyler Johnson The Freshman Emanuel at quarter four JJ trainer and Trey white Z going to get another three try misses but a core four gets the rebound have not seen Trey white hes 0 for one from the field right now Kenny pay kind of called him out after the game the other night right away saying he told him were not going to play youre not going to play selfish fish here and white is letting it come to him a little bit kicks it over to trainer in the corner drives into a double team has the ball taken away by Demetrius Davis and the mock will try to build on what is a 10 five lead Huff right down the lane zi comes up with it and cant get the jump hook to go over a core for he did a good job of pretty much staying big there nice job of a core for of staying big and just going straight up and coming down with the rebound its Trey White still waiting for it now he tries to take the hit late whistle hes going to get the foul on Davis and hes going to get two free throws yeah and Tre Whites got to let it come to him I thought the other night he really did force a lot of things on the offensive end and then he was in some foul trouble as well and just didnt kind of get into the flow of the game on and we saw you know on that last possession cards had the ball could have held it for one he went to the basket and then didnt get a great shot off the side of the backboard but did get the ball back he did somehow some way to JJ trainer for the winning Basket in that 94 93 win and he knocks in the first free throw here so a good start cards now uh one for one from the line which is quite a bit better than the other night in their open by the way Tyler Johnson at the last time out did check in for sky Clark so Johnson in I do think were going to see some Tyler and Sky together KY pay really liked what we what he saw from that he doesnt want to do it all of the time because he needs to have someone as a backup for the for sky Clark but I think youll see some of those guys play together a little bit more as we move along in the season a two for two start at the line after going 24 for 39 the other night and thats counting the 13 for 14 from Mike Music James Brady the nice catch Inside by Alexis but then he throws it away as he tried to get it to Davis in the corner actually a great idea there just the way he had to throw that ball I dont think Davis was ever going to be able to catch it Hy hfield headed hes heading over the bike thought hes headed back down the tunnel inside of cor for with nice catch and the foul inside on Rudy Fitz Gibbons whos in the game for uh for the mock I thought a core for uh I thought he uh as far as the same with Hatfield it was a second half for a COR for and Huntley Hatfield the other night they were both kind of lost in the first half but uh he had uh TI eight eight points eight points and six rebounds in 10 minutes and I just thought very active in showing a physical presence thats what Louisvilles got to have in in able in order for this team to exceed some expectations and to be a good basketball team uh Hunley Hatfield and a core for have got to show that physical presence I feel like a COR for gives you that pretty much every time hes active um Hunley Hatfield it was I thought that was kind of new the other night but hes weve seen a little bit of it tonight as well James to the basket throws up the left hander in the paint and gets it to go wasnt a great shot but it was a good look for him and uh uh you he also had trainer wide open there but he takes it himself and gets the bucket Huff goes Baseline and kicks it in the corner for another triple try for the mocks and then the littlest guy comes up with the rebound again and were going to try that again and another Miss Brady another offensive rebound get a lot of these long re bounds Huff hits the three and Johnson with the foul and Hunter Huff will have a chance to complete a fourpoint play here and that is just uncalled for for Louisville that is five offensive rebounds already for Chattanooga as you see just out hustle its Trey white and trer going to go to the bench and uh coach not happy with trer a couple of those were trainer just doesnt get a body on his guy two trips down the floor with at least two offensive rebounds for Chattanooga now honor Huff sat out last year because of the rule in the Southern Conference he came with coach from BMI so he sat out last year misses the free thr them five for seven in their opener 51 sophomore from Brooklyn New York back pass there Davis with the steel kicks it over to Huff for another triple try and backto back threes for honor huff and its 169 mocks in the early going theyre going to fire it up four for 12 from three already Mike James with his second triple of the night once again much like the opener hes carrying the cards in the early going he has eight of their 12 points they Trail at 1612 Applause Brady drives into the pain def flection by Davis and then he leaks out takes the pass James cant mess it Curtis Williams with the rebound a hustle Play From The Freshman Curtis Williams getting the first bucket for him as he hustles down the floor gets the offensive board and the crowd responds the fans who are here thats what they want to see they want to see the effort at the defensive end and then James called for the foul as Davis tries to go Baseline on it but Chattanooga some hot shooting we knew theyd be shooting some frees theyre four for 12 early and they lead Louisville 16 14 F he has eight points you see the cards look at the guys in their debut Tyler Johnson had 12 Trey white 11 sky Clark 11 first game in at least 27 years with three players scoring in double figures in their debuts with Mike J led the way with 25 in that game and has eight of their 14 tonight and on the bench with two fouls they got a foul just before we went to break honor Huff number three with 11 points for Chattanooga in the early going gille working a lot in their shoot around today on keeping their hands up as Huff misses that one rattles in and out and a coral comes down with it and tries to save it right to zedi and and K working a lot and he and Coach pay was talking about their hands were down in that opener thats why they got so much foul trouble Alexis inside over a core for cant get it to go Huntley Hatfield to rebound the Cs with a chance to tie it up or take the lead sky Clark Donal yanovich Brandon Huntley Hatfield Curtis Williams and Emanuel a COR for on the court right now for Louisville I love what Ive seen from Huntley Hatfield so far he did miss that shot but he has got the aggressive attack mentality right here as he backs zedi down misses the shot but still cant its aggressive and thats what you want to see for him and he already has five rebounds Dennis Evans set the check in to the next dead ball and three by Fitz Gibbons rattles off Curtis Williams had a a big game in his first game a sky clart goes to the basket gets the foul and hell get a chance to try and complete a threepoint play as he has tied us up at 16 and can put the cards in front with 1050 to go as Dennis Evans checks into the game Emanuel will go to the bench get the basket Ivanovic getting a little excited there I think hes going to uh sky Clark is going to have to keep attacking like that he hasnt shot well cant even go back to the two exhibition games even to the Red White scrimmage sky has not kind of come into his own as far as he canot Judith hes just going to have to keep attacking like that an 80 Run for the cards over the last two plus minutes Clark have been three for eight from the line in the opener but hits that one off down the lane try to get it to Lexis but Lexus able to come up with it eventually now hes got Evans on him and hes going to kick it back out for the Triple try and another three and that is Tyler Millan transfer from Middle Tennessee 10 new players on this chattanoog roster one of the reasons why theyre picked to finish F in the Southern Conference and there we see Curtis Williams maybe a little quick with that shot Ivanovic got position inside there for that offensive rebound and K it doesnt matter who it is they all know and you see Alexis there hes already got a three he backs Denis sevens down and kicks it out for the bucket all of these guys shoot the three it doesnt matter if its one two three four or five position youve got to know where they are because theyre all Shooters and so far Louisville not doing a good job on the defensive end five of 15 for chattano already five triples for them L with two but Mike James hit them both and hes on the bench right now in foul trouble is skot car drove Baseline looks like he took a hit yeah this guys still wincing in pain a little bit not where you want to get hit 933 to go 1917 MOX lead it Bren Hampton doing some clean up there is telling Sam Alexis to tuck in the Jersey stri passes up the three steps in yvanovich down the lane and the lefthander cant get it to go the tip by Hunley headfield to keep that alive hes active hes making a difference for this Louisville team on both ends right now oh not on the same page there Evans rolled and looked like sky Clark thought he had him but Evans I think he got an elbow from maybe Z in the back and thats why he couldnt jump for that was indicting zi with a really nice job there of just knocking him off his line a little bit thats what Dennis is going to have to learn uh to be a little stronger in that one nice play there by Scott Clark he get Taps the ball away from Millan 16 seconds on the shot clock for Chattanooga Michael Chase set to throw it in on the Baseline as Demetrius Davis back in the game from them number two Sam Alexis heads to the bench for the Box Chay out to new Z guarded by Huntley Hatfield youll see it a lot they drive pass up would look to be open layups to get it back out for the three less theyre not going to get the shot off shot clock violation thats one where zedi you dont want to pass that one up when he had a pretty good shot a pretty good look Im sorry Shay had a pretty good look in the corner and hes telling the coaches hey thats my fault but lville a good job on defense look at this close look at the close out there by Curtis Williams Scott Clark with the close out thats what Kenny Payne wants to see from this team on the defensive end if theyre going to be successful thats what they have to do defensively number zero Noah melson a freshman from Douglasville Georgia in the game for the mocks JJ trainer back in for the cards Clark gets to the basket then shov his feet once he got the paint yeah he slipped a little bit he it looked like he it looked like he slipped and uh yeah turnover for the cards turnover number number six been a bit of an issue but not as bad as it was in the open they theyve improved Curtis Williams though I feel like you know we saw him in the red white strimm he forced in the first half came out in the second half looked great played really well against s he can shoot it hes a guy if he could get on a little Street hes hadnt had a chance yet in the game we at another Corner three missed by Davis and another rebound ply half here so far hes the MVP tonight just because hes being aggressive as Curtis Williams nice job taking the ball off the balance there and drawing a foul as the cards have cut it to within two Chattanooga with five threes so far up 1917 onepoint win over MBC here on Monday night game they trailed by eight at the half outscored the retrievers 5445 in the second half and Mike James with a huge game 25 points 10 rebounds his first Double Double JJ trainer with a gamewinning dunk off the pass from Trey white with 8 seconds remaining as the card shot 59 in the second half of that game to get the win and get Kenny Payne one and0 for this season trying to get to two and0 here sky Clark donello yanovich Brandon Huntley Hatfield who has how many rebounds Joey he already has eight his career high is 12 and Huntley Hatfield being very aggressive and again T struggling on the offensive end 0 for three but theyve all been good attacking attacking for him as you see eight rebounds tonight already JJ trainer and Curtis Williams six on the shot clock for the cards Hunley have there the lob inside of trainer the catch and cant get an angle to get it up on the basket and here come the mocks four different Chattanooga players a bit triples in this one theyre five of 16 from three Louisville two of three from deep but both those by Mike James who has is on the bench still with those two personal fouls both teams with five team fouls honor Huff down the lane the spin a little bit out of control pretty good defense there by Curtis Williams and the Cs with a Chance again to Tire Take the Lead Williams straight line drive to the basket puts it up and in oh my gosh its unbelievable the Curtis Williams on the defensive end then on the offensive end the Freshman doing what hes supposed to do and uh thats coming through for his team boy as a nice drive Chay tried the triple from the corner cant get it to go yvanovich with the decent box out but Millan still gets the offensive rebound the follow away jumper on the Baseline is an airball yanovich runs the floor well are we going to get a were going to get a block on Huff was that what we got there I Im waiting for Brent Hampton to no he oh its no good the baskets not good Jamal Spearman called it out front a little bit there but uh it is the block yanovich aggressive taking it that was a first personal on Huff but the sixth team foul on the Mox and then what is that a makeup called I think that I just checks into the game and right away he gets called for the offensive foul on that Baseline out of bounds play is Bren Hampton say it I think I had that other call lets see if we got it here H I dont know about that not exactly as uh dramatic is that James Madison Kent State play last night if you saw or not uh was it Jame yeah James Madison Kent State James Madison who beat Michigan State in their opener yes last second pushed last night as they won again honor off another air ball and Huntley hafi with another rebound Jody Trey white back in the game I was going to ask you about him he had been on the bench for a while looked a little timid he comes in and turns it over and and thats what you dont want to do if youre Trey white youre youre attack your your good stuff is midrange game he thats one where he probably should have pulled up right there and taken it Huff with another three and that was on Trey white and that is the fourth triple of the game for Honor Hoff hes missed several shots 10 hes missed several shots at the basket where his airball and he hits threes that play might have been called Chattanooga and then white with the offensive rebound flips it up off the glass and hell get a chance to shoot a couple free throws and thats where his two points have come from heres the heres the steal from Davis as he gets out and goes in transition and come down and it ends up being a huff three again again hes for nine from the field four from six from three Kent and his two air balls have been coming inside inside the lane I think he needs to stay behind the threepoint Arc huh and he really shouldnt be able to get a three off over the 67 Trey white either white two for two from the line so far tonight makes it three for three for his three points will James sit out the remainder of the first half you think Jody I think were probably going to see him yes as long as he is right now lets see 2220 I think it was 1129 maybe it I think theyll try to get him to the halftime Huff is four of six from three the rest of his team two for 12 as Trey white makes both of the free throws and pulls the cards within 2221 cards have done a pretty good job on zi coming off his 25o effort he only has two points one of five from the field here in the are they going Chay brings it up closely guarded and then the back door cut he tried to get it to Davis but threw it out of bounds thats another thing that coach Earl loves that back door cut we see it a lot and youve saw it a lot with his VMI teams now you saw it last year theyre going to try to do that time and time again Louisville that one very lucky because it could have been an easy layup speaking of back door cuts the next game for this Chattanooga team Beller on Tuesday nights at Chattanooga Louisville of course will play the kns on November 30th Sky clar gets up there that ball went between the legs of Caleb Glen and huff with another three on the break and he hits Music it that is five threepointers for Honor Huff he has 17 points and its 2521 Huntley Hatfield with the basket and I believe he was in the restrict was he not in the restricted area J Spearman calling the charge on Huntley Hatfield but it was close tough to tell from our Applause angle lets look at it no he just got out pretty good defense There by Randy B to get out of the restricted area and draw the charge on a Huntley Hatfield his first personal he has nine rebounds already as Jody mentioned his career high 12 2521 H tries to go Baseline he needs it hes wide open huff is wide open in the corner but Johnson gets to him Chase hits one inside the ark and a weird different kind of lineup here for Louisville with Glenn and Tyler Johnson with skot Clark Trey white and Dennis Evans you wonder how long Kenny Payne can afford to keep James on the bench his white Miss Evans cant get the rebound you know why cuz he was boxed out by Honor Huff Chay with the Deep three try cant get it to go and another rebound for Trey White NOW WI a little more aggressive cant get that one to go off the glass Evans gets the rebound and brings it down low up for sun in and Trey white hit by Bryant Brady as he goes to the basket and Whites four for four from the line heading back that way and K Trey white continues to struggle Louisville 2721 tray and Chattanooga onor Huff show here at the kfcm center the Chattanooga guard 6 for 10 for the field 5 for 10 from three here as chattan leads little 2721 Jody hes hitting from all all over the place it has been the honor Hub show six of 10 like you said five of seven a couple of short ones that he missed but hes not missing from long range you see there 17 points rest of his team is four of 21 the rest of the team hes seven of 20 from three the rest of his team is two of 13 and you can see why he is a first team preseason all Southern Conference selection and one one constant theme with those five threes Kent Louisville either had he was wide open got one off of transition or Louisville had a guy running at him late theyre just getting too late to hter hu cars with a 2217 advantage on the board and both teams have seven offensive rebounds which a little surprising to me because theres theres kind of stand out theyre getting threes off their offensive rebounds yes but there we should also mention that they were they were ahead six to2 in offensive rebounds so Louisville has done a better job here lately white knocks down another free throw all six of his points from the line six for six from the line Mike James still on the bench with those two fouls and his eight points in the first eight minutes of this game but the cards have been able to at least maintain relatively close range Brady the back door cut the nice dish and the Freshman Noah melson is going to go to the line for two free throws coming up at halftime uh make sure to hang around because weve got new head coaches in the ACC whos the team to be on the lookout for and of course first half highlights and stats but some UL students youll see them in the studio here uh of course you know Jody always say it the nest crew is the best crew we appreciate Bobby blanket ship and the entire Jeremy know and that whole team over there and theyre working with some students here at U now and its really impressive the work that these kids are doing as they try to take our jobs theyre going to I say not only take our jobs but some uh in studio jobs as well they do a great job so stick around in halftime for that Noah Nelson The Freshman from Douglasville Georgia knocks in the second free throw 2823 the largest UTC lead has been seven Chattanooga L it by seven at 16 to9 thats courtesy of Ken horn the stat man extraordinaire whos with us here again cour side at the KFC Young Center Scott Clark going to dial up the Triple cant get it to go and the hold inside on Demetrius Davis as Caleb Glenn goes to the court and Calebs all right and I believe the foul is going to be on Davis which would give Glenn a chance to shoot some free throws were going to look at that for for a hook and hold havent seen H seen it in a while but uh I saw one in a game I was watching a game a couple nights ago wasnt watching last night because we were at a football game last night congrats to the cards by the way for winning football but uh I watched this the other night and they showed this and thats textbook that is textbook hook and hold I think I say I think because you just never know anymore but I point of emphasis a couple years ago they called it every time down um well see what we come up with if it if that is in fact the call on Demetrius Davis the cards are in the bonus so Caleb Blen would get a chance to shoot some free throws well see here here you go Jody illegal contact caused by hooking an opponent over or under the arm with the clamp there to deceive the official into believing it was caused by the opponent its its this is a different one um Bren Hampton made the call and he was right behind there so he probably had a better view no matter no matter what angle you have he had a better View and I think its going to be not a hook and hole just a one and one so we were wrong again it it didnt look all that flagrant no but it doesnt have to though if you look at the all right Caleb Glen has not a point yet as a card but hes going to get a chance here the former Louisville Male High star who went to lauma in Indianapolis uh or in Indiana last year a prep school you love his effort Jody hes got a motor that doesnt stop and is is going to be a player here at L he misses the first free throw he is going to be that was a cards first free throw Miss of the night hes going to be a player and he physically ready right now to play which you dont see from a lot of freshman you look at that body he is ready to play some minutes Z looks like hes shot clock at five deflection by Trey white Huff is going to have to shoot it thats not what Louisville wants I thought look at Glen go way up for the rebound good I thought he was going to make that and again thats not what Louis wants him shooting but I theyll take it from half court pretty much any time Caleb glims going to continue to get some minutes if he does those kind of things he gets that rebound white with the Miss and Miller with the rebound for Chattanooga they lead it 2823 Brandon Huntley Hatfield set to check in an that Ball Zi again in the lane and they keep on swinging it and they get the three of the corner from melson its just what they do you know thats what theyre going to do they have one good shot they swing it a little bit more and they get a wide open shot that is their largest lead of the night right now at 3123 on their eighth triple in the first half Tyler Johnson all the way to the basket everything but the Finish but then gets his own offensive rebound Trey Whites going to pop the three but he gets it to Glenn who gets the shot inside but cant get it to go and Caleb Glenn will get a chance now for two free throws at 3123 already a big day for Louisville Athletics as the U field hockey team open the NCAA tournament in Evon Illinois with a 21 win over number eight Iowa Jody yes and uh Amy Plum getting it in two the second overtime just two minutes left until they were going to go to a shootout little advances to the quarterfinals theyll take on Northwestern Sunday with a spot in the final four on the line and guess who the only lost Northwestern has this season to Louisville Louisville yes one nothing in their first game of the year Caleb Glenn now 0 for three from the line goodness Trey white sky Clark the two transfers who came in here Jody who most people expected to be the leaders of this club one of 11 from the field here in the first half as the cards Trail by eight thats the same deficit they had at halftime on Monday night to UNBC Z gets in the P travels heres the fifth turnover tonight for chattan niga look at JJ trainer back in the game and seems clear at this point that Mike James will not play the remainder of the first half he sat down with I believe it was 1129 to go with eight points and the only two threes that Louisvilles hit in this first half and white Trey white and sky Clark have got to get out of this offensive Funk they just havent had any kind of no fluid to their game here in the first couple of games of the season Johnson trying to get it the Huntley half field not a great look Chay pulls up on the break and hits another threepointer that is not a two oh put on the line okay just a twopointer but still its a 10o lead for Chattanooga with 116 left we love our house its on a great block Tree Line streets the neighbors are observant and were back at the Sullivan house its Lae Sheila and the leaves are piling up a bit of an ey sore Ill say dry shave interesting technique thats going to come back to haunt him some people clean while they cook not these folks at least Geico makes bundling our home and car insurance easy saves us a ton if only theyd bundled the leaves you know I wouldnt have pegged these two as yogis I still dont for bundling Made Easy Go to geicocom Dan ear and Chattanooga on an 112 run over the last four 4 and2 minutes Michael Chay the pullup jumper but his foot was on the line so the lead is 10 right now for the Chattanooga MOX here in the KFC Yum Center they are shooting 35 from the field but theyre 8 for 22 from three and theyre holding L is 26 shooting Ken I will tell you this look Huff five of eight has been great for chattano go but what I love about this team is the unselfishness you see on the offensive end its what coach Earl wants they move the ball they take they pass up good shots to get great shots sometimes they pass up great shots to get threepointers but you know what they make them and everybody in their lineup can shoot and again pick to finish fifth in the Southern Conference but that was with 10 new players Demetrius Davis their only returning starter As Nice play out of the timeout Curtis was in for the easy layup and he scored a couple baskets here tonight for the cars as theyre back within eight shade goes right by Williams gets in the paint and then walks another turnover so the Cs will have a chance to cut into this eightpoint lead how about this play Jody yeah Curtis Williams with again being aggressive attacking and uh his versatility he uh before Tyler Johnson got ruled eligible Curtis Williams was going to be the backup point guard for this team team so he is a guy that can do a little bit of everything the close out by zi prevents the three Johnson will try the triple and just a little short off the front of the rim but Curtis Williams with the offensive rebound and comes back up it has a knock Away by H Huntley Hatfield gets it and puts it in was that a rebound is that counted his 10th rebound Im not sure but he gets the basket Im not sure if it I dont think that does but it is accounts as an aggressive aggressive play is what it was from hutley Hatfield Danner with the quick timeout here with 184 seconds left cards will have a chance to get one final stop here Jody and when youre down 10 just a couple seconds ago I think they have to feel decent about going in at the half if theyre only down six or less well Mike James hasnt played for 11 minutes and something seconds so as you see there the Miss from Johnson good job keeping it alive from Williams He backs it up knocks it off and there is Brandon Hunley Hatfield with it and Williams he does not appear to get a rebound for that and no he does not but Williams gets credited with his second offensive rebound the cards now with 10 remember they trailed 6 to2 offensive rebounds early on in the half it is now uh it is they theyre now up 10 to7 on offensive rebounds cards also with 10 second chance points 108 Advantage there and and out rebounding the mocks 26 to 20 all right Curtis Williams Trey white Brandon Hunley Hatfield Scott Clark Tyler Johnson on the court for the cards heres zedi 16 to play 15 and cting honor Huff with 17 points with the ball here to lead the MOX gets the pick from zedi see if he can get it up and over Huntley Hatfield he gets the shot off but cant get it to go but offensive rebounding Davis had more time I think than he thought as he just threw that up but the cards get that defensive stop and after trailing UNBC by 8 and the half on Monday night and coming back to Win Louisville heads to the locker room now with a sixpoint deficit Monday night at the half to beat UNBC by one didnt get a lot out of sky Clark in that first half either as he gets in the paint is able to score right away and thats the thing nothing from really from sky Clark six of six from the line from Trey white but hes 0 for four so if youre Louisville you have to feel I mean youre only you dont have mik games out there but 8 minutes and you dont get much from those two guys you got to feel halfway like okay we were not too far out of this Clark now two of eight of course Yan Zen who had 25 points in their opener he only had two in that first half and right away theyre going to get another three by Michael Chay and theyre back up by seven threes the issue they hit eight in that first half and L was only two triples cards were two from eight from three and both by Mike James who I said a minute ago sat out the the last 1129 of that half Clark with his second shot HFF tipped it out to James who goes aggressively to the basket and hes going to a chance to shoot a couple free throws because he was fouled there by Alexis in the paints the three from Chay is uh as he gets the kick out as Clark runs by and he gets the open three J 6385 lb a senior or a freshman from Los Angeles played at the skill factory prep and K he at one point was committed to South Florida really good just a a good allaround guard that was the second foul on Alexis James 13 of 14 from the line the other night and E not a great start tonight carts hit their first seven free throws tonight after hitting just 24 of 39 in the win over BC but then Caleb Glenn had missed three in a row and Mike James with the Miss and its four in a row and now its five in a row and Huntley hfield with his 10th rebound so his second straight 10 rebound game to start the season which is a good thing to see white Comm Miss in the paint and Alexis the rebound and now Chattanooga with a chance to increase what is a sevenpoint lead their largest lead of the game has been eight and Zi will try the three cant get it to go James with a rebound Applause lot of contct H HFF is going to beat everybody down the court for the L in he has 19 points a rare twopointer for him just his second twopoint basket of the night to go with his five five triples he has 19 points and it this is now the biggest lead of the night for the MOX of Chattanooga at nine points with just under 18 minutes to play and were going to get an offensive foul on sky Clark I think it was in the paint on the screen Clark picks up the foul and uh there we go heres Z with the K out and H nobody back the easy layup hes made five threes and that one was an easy bucket there for points number 18 and 19 Alexis the big fellow try to trip up from the corner and why not everybodys hitting them that is 10 threepointers tonight for Chattanooga the crowd getting a little Restless here and the lead lead is up to 12 with 1744 left Chattanooga 41 Louisville 29 its here at home and then competition gets a little stiffer on November 19th when they head to Madison Square Garden along with Jody demling here by the way we should pass on our condolences to anyways Jody Deming and the cards will take on number 18 Texas uh and M Square guard I was about to pass on our condolences to Paul Rogers who had a death in his family uh hes not on the radio tonight and current doing the Louisville local radio broadcast 4129 Chattanooga with the lead the mocks have hit 10 at threepointers already in this game Louisvilles only hit two you thought Louisville after shooting 30 in the first half as Trey white gets in the pain and is able to score his first field goal the night they were obviously going to have to shoot a little better to overcome that sixpoint deficit well he started off just one for four in the second half but white gets the basket to go and rs cut the lead back to 10 and were going to get a moving screen there on Alexis thats been a uh point in a lot of emphasis in a lot of games that Ive watched so far this first week Ive seen more moving screens than they called that on J though did they still offensive foul a lot of them here we go Clark treay white Brandon Huntley Hatfield already with 10 rebounds D of sens and Mike James who scored eight points all in the first eight minutes of the game white inside gets that to go didnt even look like he had control of it really but he gets the foul on Millan and hell get a chance to complete the threepoint play and a little could be a 0 run here for Trey white and look Trey white is a really good player hes one of the most talented guys on this team hes struggling right now for Louisville its going to come for him and you see the last two times down the floor his midrange game his pullup game thats what makes Trey white so good and uh hes not got 11 points 4134 cards back within Applause seven 11 points in this opening game for Louisville 11 tonight here to lead the way scoring double figures in the two exhibition games for Louisville as well after his all Pack 12 freshman season and out of bounds to the Baseline another turn for the box there the little Ratt well and thats what they want to see Trey white went to help sky Clark on Huff so their Huff wasnt open and when he left him he got he was fast enough they did a little switch where Clark got there and it just kind of rattled Chattanooga just a little bit and they stepped on the out of bounds line Clark gets the screen all the way to the basket Alexis rejects that zedi who had 25 points in the opener for them only has two tonight so another steal for the Cs James all the way to the basket on Chay and well see if we dont get a foul on Chay who where did zi come flying from were going to get a Char on Mike James and most importantly Jody that will be the third personal foul on Mike James with 16 minutes left here well take a look at that on the other side of the break on the bench with three personal fouls with 16 minutes to go and his last foul picked up just before we went to break and Michael CH did he get there did he beat him does he have legal guarding position there Jody yeah I dont know thats a tough call there it looked like Justin Porterfield under the basket was going to call a block and Brett Hampton kind of took over coming on the trail I think from one angle its a block and the other angle its a charge I mean I really do think its that close break for the cars so James Goes to the bench where he spent the final 11 minutes and 29 seconds of the first half he still is the card no he the second leading score with eight points Trey white has 11 now but he is the only C to hit a three tonight Louisville two for eight from three and Chase jumper is good and the Freshman from California couple big baskets here early in the second half and back to a ninepoint pushing for the mocks Hunley Hatfield Im not sure what he saw there trying to get it to Evans just threw it right to Alexis trainer set to check in for the cards of the next dead ball heres Yan Z 25 points in an open are just two tonight Davis Alex is fouled by Evans and the cards need something here they need a little burst because right now theres not a lot of energy in this building and theyre struggling down nine with 1515 to play yeah and he just um reaching in there on Evans just a little reach Im watching Kenny Payne give him some instruction and thats what hes telling him keep those hands up big fella honor Huff all the way to the basket throws it up cant get it to go white with another rebound who could the burst come from will it be Trey white thats where its going to have to come from really quite honestly its going to have to come from Trey white because hes the one that is looks like tonight hes in that offensive mindset skot second yes exactly skot clart just two of 10 looks a little uh a little timid there on offense oh Chay with the fake Williams to fly by and Chay with the basket in the paint and the lead is back to nine really its been Trey White Mike James for those first eight minutes and then no one else has really done much for the cards tonight Williams has a couple of Bs get hes a guy who could get going three off the back of the rim and shanon have Chas saying lets slow it down for a minute here theyre 10 for 26 from three match up bad match up there for Williams and Alexis goes right by him and scores at the basket to increase the lead back to 11 the largest lead of the night so far for the box has been 12 Tyler Johnson will check in at the next dead ball for the C how long can Kenny pay afford to keep Mike James on the bench c not long he really cant I mean quite honestly its 11 I I think you youre getting to a point where you almost have to put him back in here with three Applause fouls back out to Chay Chay to the basket hes going to get fouled by Trey white Chattanooga up 11 here on Louisville 18 of 43 from the field 10 of 26 from three as you see they lost seven guys from last year they got four returnings three of those guys played some you know log some key minutes last year four transfers in six freshman and get they lost 79 of their scoring from last season coach Earl has done a good job of putting together a really good team and I do think they were ranked fifth in the socon but theyre going to be better than that just because Kent nobody really knew kind of what they had with all these newcomers Michael Chay a 62 freshman from Los Angeles California is three for three for the field in this half as you see uh one of the voters did pick them to win the league but picked to finish fifth in the league and year number two under Dan Earl Michael Chay has not missed a shot in the second half from the field or the line and he knocks down that second free throw and the lead is now 13 which is the largest lead of the night for the Chattanooga mocks as Rudy Fitz Gibbons a transfer from The Citadel one of those transfers checks in the game number 11 trainer has the ball go through his hands but white comes up with Applause it white the only offense that the Cs have gotten here in second half pretty much other than one skott Clark basket and Mike James stays over there on that bench here 13 minutes to go whats the cut off is it 12 is it the under its the under I think it has to be the Under 12 timeout some of the cards here yeah they just they just look a little timid offensively were seeing a lot of standing around not the movement that weve seen white in the paint and he walked thats another turnover how about this score update Arizona and Duke tied at 54 right now Duke uh the preseason favorite to win the ACC Here Comes Mike James hes headed to the scorers table with 12 and A2 minutes to go well see if we can get in before uh we get a TV time out under 12 are close to it and H three comes off the rim but Alexis flies in for the offensive rebounds scar didnt get a body on him and he puts it up and in and the lead is at 15 right now and does Kenny B call a timeout to get Mike James in for this offensive possession or just let this play out play got to this point so far but Chattanooga just in a a really good display of of being patient and taking what lilles giving him as fin Happ everything but the Finish white the rebound cant get it to go and then Fitz gibons took it away from Huntley Hatfield and then it is Brady blocked by Huntley Hatfield Brady again back out for the three oh goodness gracious my goodness he stepped away look like Steph Curry pulling the trigger on that one and that is the sixth triple of the night for Honor huff and this is an 18point game and now Kenny Payne has to call time out and get Mike James back in it but because the cards are in trouble theres four field goals in their second half and four turnovers they Trail by 18 why wait all month long get your Black Friday deal today transferring with his coach Dan Earl came over from VMI and in the same league his first game for Chattanooga 0 for five from three in that game well tonight hes 6 for 11 from three that is a career high six triples for him 22 points hes one away from his career high of 23 that he had at DMI but that is a Chattanooga career high Scott Clark with a miss out of the timeout games back in the game and James I thought he was going to get a three but he drives in on Davis Scott Clark has struggled offensively all night James gets the triple try and after sitting on the bench so long that thing went off the side of the rim Scott Clark two for 11 from the field 0 for two from three with four turnovers so not a great first 30 minutes for him tonight Johnson with a steel Jody and hes going to get the breakway lay up and well see if that can ignite a little run hes got the speed and the good good job on defense there from Tyler look I this is the thing K Louisville has got to pick it up on the defensive end Tyler gets a foul there but to be a little more aggressive youve got to pick it up on the defensive end for you to do something on the offensive end a steal there from Tyler and he goes in for the bucket by the way Huff Huff has 22 points I said his career high 23 guess who it was against jod Chattanooga Chattanooga I was just going to say okay Huff down the lane ball deflected and then it went back off of Huff who was out of bounds down on that Baseline so another turnover maybe a little opening here for the cars to make a run but theyre going to have to have someone step up and start scoring Tyler the Miss he at least tried to get the offensive rebounder couldnt do it its a lot of oneonone stuff on the offensive end and then Louisville just a step slow on the defensive end Brady with the aggressive move down the lane and then ball goes out of bouns but it will stay here with Chad and there will be 17 seconds on the shot clock 104 left in the game and the MOX lead Louisville 54 to 38 is Chad NOA won the first five meetings between these two schools but the cards have won the last five Michael Chay with the air ball on the Baseline but another offensive rebound Chay again started a couple of Threes Kent he is just getting whatever he wants against this Louisville defense 57 38 Chattanooga leads it JJ trainer with the three just the third three of the night for the cards and theyre back within Applause 16 Chay is four for five from the field in the second half including a couple threes Fitz Gibbons with a three and the quarter James with the Applause rebound thought trainer might pull that one there as he hit the hit the one before the trainer trainers got the size advantage on Chay and Chay another charge hes done that a couple times tonight doesnt agree with it uel bench does doesnt agree with it but hes duck that shoulder hes there he he puts his shoulder into him thats a charge crowd wanted to flop but some of the fans in the Hollywood seats here arguing as well including former card Parry Johnson Jody thats two fouls on trainer in 3 seconds there this is third of the game and the seventh foul on the card so Chattanooga now going to shoot some free throws theyre only three for five in the game so far but Tyler Millan will go to the line right now for a one in a bonus and Mike James is actually going to come out of the game as Curtis Williams comes back in I thought they might get Curtis Williams in I wasnt sure it was going to be for Mike James cuz Curtis has actually been the one Cardinal uh at least in the first half that was that was active and and did some positive things six points couple of rebounds and couple of deflections Manel L for back in too Huntley Hatfield would go to the bench he does have 11 rebounds but just two points on one for five shooting tonight but the cards leading rebounder as that rebounding now back is even now at 33 all as Millan knocks in the first free throw so hell get a second the lead 17 right now for Chattanooga Over Louisville 12 of 31 from three we told you they were going to shoot a lot of them they could shoot him from all different positions on the floor from the one through the five and boy oh boy have they done it Noah knocks down that second free throw a COR for did have three rebounds in his 5 Music Applause minutes Five Guys looks like some confusion there here what exactly they want to run as the shot clock now at 16 seconds not not really the time to run clock down 18 with 841 to go Johnson will try the three can hit that and that one went halfway down and then deflected and Im pretty sure thats going to be Lal ball in the Baseline shot clock resets to 20 and theyll get another chance of this one good look for Tyler Johnson it was directly in front of us and it cant get a better look for him ball just doesnt go down a quarter for the spinning the paint the air ball yeah without James out there Williams is the guy maybe who could who could catch fire if he could get some open shots Alexis goes Baseline and then spin trainer got his hand on it but couldnt come up with it Chay has been the star of the second half down the lane and why not just throw it up but he hurt his back on the play and he is still on the ground and I dont think there was any real contact all he just landed awkwardly on his hip and hes hes holding his right hip hes in quite a bit of pain huh he is and that was just a really awkward way that he landed theres 14 points now in the second half 18 for the game mil Shay is putting on a show here and that basket right there gave him as you said 18 points and their largest lead of the game at 20 as he is now up Chay will get a round of applause from the crowd here that remains as he limps off though still yeah that doesnt look good I well take a break Lille down 20 with 807 in the second half Louisville has 14 points in the second half and Miles Chay has 14 points in the second half he has 18 in the game seven of 12 in the field two of six from the three and he was injured just before we went to break there back in the locker room still we dont see him out here so Dan Earl has got the second half from his freshman Guard from California and the cards with plenty of work to do because they Trail by 20 with 8 minutes to play I love miles Jay his game is fantastic Tyler Johnson drives Trey white kick and a three for white from the corner you know why one of the things I love Jay you know the the best thing originally hes number 77 anybody that wears 77 I like that well and they they just had an issue this is the first time they worn their gold uniform so apparently there was an issue so we had number changes from their first game yon zic it hasnt worked out for him yet he scored 25 in their first game and has only scored two points here tonight so far with that new number but Michael CH I think will stick with number 12 it is as Alexis scores this is a the Cs might make a run this been a game where Dennis Evan with Evans with three points and two two points and three rebounds hasnt been great for Louisville as hes been physically getting push around down there what Tyler Johnson is playing hes hes playing the hardest of any lobal player right now on the floor on both on the floor on both ends honor Huff with 22 points one away from his career high Alexis with what he feels is a mismatch and he gets the jump hook to go over white and it is a 21o Music game Applause Johnson gets to the basket gets fouled hell get two free throws with 641 to go Chattanooga has come into the KFC y center and leads lurel 65 44 okay I think Coach pay knew this was a tough matchup for his team at this point but I dont think he felt like that they I think he felt like they could play better on the defensive end and what they have here and quite honestly as bad as theyve been on the defensive end the offensive end has hasnt been much better at 30 point 305 uh 308 from the pr field and now just 9 of 14 from the free throw Applause line Johnson knocks in the first get Mike James back in the game all eight of his points came in the first eight minutes of the game before he picked up two quick fouls Johnson knock in the second free throw 65 46 apparently hes playing the Southern Conference Team here in the KF m center in November is not a great thing Ferman came in here a couple years ago and knocked off Louisville and now it is Chattanooga with what would appear to be a I would love to see more turnover Mill just kind of one of their worst plays of the game cards on the run and Traer with this slam and Louisville is back within 17 so i love to see Lille get out a little bit more on transition try to force for the tempo and force the issue a little bit here play with a little more urgency and thats what they did on that possession Melton misses and thats another rebound for Huntley ha there which will give him his career high 12 Clark all the way zedi did a pretty good job just kind of maintaining his position and Clark cant get it to go and then Huff speeds by everybody but Alexis with the follow slam and the big fella has 16 points for chattanoga as they lead is back up to 19 not exactly the response you thought youd get from Louisville coming off the dramatic onepoint win over UNBC on Monday night Jody as James Goes to the basket and scores get a chance at a threepoint play but he kind of were hoping theyd get a little boost of Confidence from that win on Monday night or at least Louisville fans were thinking well and and again 94 points they they got to the free throw line a ton they drew a ton of fouls and tonight it just hasnt been that they havent had much on the offensive end and theyre still struggling as they did the other night on the defensive Music end Davis comes back in for Chattanooga yeah Alexis will stay on the FL he has 16 points and nine rebounds Millan with 10 rebounds for them you mentioned Huntley Hatfield his career high earlier he has now 12 rebounds as equal chattan Nuka is now out rebounding Louisville 3635 and the margin was was pretty large in the cards favor early on James completes the threepoint play so he now has 11 points still just three personal fouls sat for quite a bit of time in this one in foul trouble puff for three got it thats his seventh thats a new career high for him he has 25 points yeah I can see coach Earl wanted him with him from BMI boy he is a player Mike James a three from the corner James with his third three of the night for Louisville hes got 14 now turns out that last Huff three was almost like an aacy for some fans here as theyre up trying to beat the traffic 16 points now with 5 minutes to go the lead for Chattanooga Alexis gets Huff back door the kick in the corner Brady almost turned it over but Davis comes up with it on the Baseline he does turn it over and with the shot clock Applause violation here is Huff ker High seven threepointers hes got 25 now nine of 17 from the field and remember early on Kent two shots he had really close to the back ask he airball both of them since then he cant miss seven of 12 from three take a timeout up 7054 gety up but he also has 18 points here tonight 14 of those 18 in the second half as Chattanooga led by six at the half and right now they lead 70 to 54 with 439 to play Louisville with the ball after 4 ing that shot clock violation on the turnover they get the dump for JJ trainer off that Baseline out of bounds play and trainer has come alive here in the last couple minutes yeah he really has he was struggling throughout the first half didnt play a ton of minutes time hes putting back in though hes been active seven points here in the last few minutes for JJ trainer but the deficit is still 14 is it an insurmountable one as Alexis misses the jump Applause h cards are going to have to hit a three or two to get to get cut into this 14point deficit in the final four minutes so far that has been trainer misses the two hat C the at field with a new career high now 13 rebounds whs open up top with James wanton but hes going to go all the way on Chay cant get it to go and Alexis with another rebound and he now has a double double to that and I think Mike James thought there was going to be contact and he was trying to draw the contact and almost kind of forgot he was just wide open right there could have made it easy bucket or he could have k out to White as well cards five of 15 from three Chattanooga 13 for 32 three different UFL players have hit triples tonight white trainer and James against another rebound for Huntley he thats 14 rebounds for him Applause oh White had that one knocked away itll be cards ball in the Baseline they Trail it by 14 with 3 minutes to play thats going to be a great game between Yukon and Indiana so you got a tough one there and you come home New Mexico State entirely new roster and Beller and then youre at theal before you finish up Arkansas State Pepperdine and Kentucky here number 21st here we go Mike James JJ trainer Trey white sky Clark and Brandon Huntley Hatfield not only Hatfield with the size advantage and he gets in the paint and scores just his second Buck of the night he has been a little more aggressive on the offensive end or at least he was in the first half with four points and 14 rebounds now let say 70 run from the car for the cards here to cut the lead to 12 with 240 to go and clearly every possession is pretty big from here on out and were going to get an issue with some condensation on the floor there well get that wiped up and the shot clock is at 14 seconds heres miles k we told you a second ago hes back on after leaving for a second after he hit the floor hard he turns it over and Hunley helds going to get the Breakaway dunk here and Louisvilles back within 10 the fans whove hung around to stay for the end of this one are up and another turnover off the press Scott Clark with the basket and hes fouled and its an eightpoint deficit and Clark will go to the line to try to make it seven and just a hustle hustle hustle play hle field getting it started and he gets the dunk after getting the deflection to get the steel and then sky Clark with a bucket and hes going to get a free throw Demetrius Davis will come in the game for the mocks Randy Brady heads to the bench sky Clark a chance to cut that lead to seven this is an 110 run for Louisville and a 143 run over the last 320 theyve held Chattanooga scoreless for just over 3 minutes the largest lead was 21 with 652 to go at 6544 and the cards have cut that to seven and Chattanooga had some issues with the pressure in the cards are starting to apply it sh wagering everybody off gets across the timeline with a couple seconds to spare 20 out on the shot clock as Clarks bodying him up Alexis has 16 points and 10 rebounds theyll get it to him hes got Davis with five on the shot clock the floater rattles out Trey white with the rebound in between two Mox and here come the cards 144 to go big rebound from Trey White Applause oh the three in the corner rattles out Hunley half field keeps it alive Alexis Dives on the ground for it and the possession arrow favors the mock with 134 left the play Dan was trying to get a timeout but they called the jump ball first yeah they called the jump ball want timeout he does not want a timeout itll be chatt G Bal or that three from the corner from James oh it looked good good chance and it was a good shot from the guards in transition coming down a great job on the defensive end again Huntley Hatfield getting some being active and getting his hand on a on a on a ball on a pass W bench wanting to walk there on Chay it was close this is about the last possession youre going to be able to let him dribble out the shot clock here 10 seconds on that clock pu to the basket kicks it out zc he has not hit a three yet tonight but he has now Yan zc only had two points after 25 in the opener and the pepperine grag transfer knocks in what would appear to be a dagger with 111 left that is the dagger right there and louville let them play The Possession out and again the Cardinals just leave a shooter hes the sixth player to hit a three tonight for uh Chattanooga and and K they can all shoot it he was three for four The Scouting Report is dont leave him and what did the cards do they continue to do that its now 14 of 34 for the game and the marck 6 for 11 from three in this second half all right quick reset a 10point lead for Chattanooga 111 to play each team with just one time out left no fouls to give both teams in the bonus but not the double bonus just seven team fouls each and the possession arrow favors the cards after that jump ball we had on the last Louisville possession Louisville with 15 turnovers in the game Chattanooga with 16 and the cards with a 4039 rebound Edge Brandon Huntley atfield a career high 14 boards for Louisville Scott Clark all the way for the lay in and the lead is back to eight now its going to be they try to turn him over quickly but youre going to have to foul pretty quick to extend this game because youre down by 8 with 54 seconds to go you cant let them run 20 more seconds off the shot clock and the bench is trying to tell him the entire possession the bench has been trying to tell him to foul and they have not done it yet theyre not listening until Huntley Hatfield does and they just wasted 25 few more seconds yeah the bench though cant Danny Manning Nolan Smith Kenny Payne all of them up yelling when they got to half court to foul and Mike James and sky Clark just continued to guard and didnt foul all right heres Jan zi he will go to the line and he knocks in the first free throw thats his first free throw attempt tonight and his first free throw attempt of the season did not attempt one in their opener game in which he had 25 points but he was a 77 free throw shooter at Pepperdine and he knocks those two to in easily and Yan zic who had two points just a second ago right now has seven and the lead is back to 10 and the cards are taking their time trying to get a shot here down 10 with 30 seconds to go but Clarks three got Applause it so is there anything to take still a little Hill to climb here to win this game but is there anything to take from the last couple of minutes and the run that Louisville has made to get back to 21 Point deficit yeah as we see Trey uh Trey white kicking it to Scott Clark theyre going to look at it theyre looking his foot was on the line just the Baseline replay I saw right there yeah theyre thats why they uh theyre looking at it but look this is a team they havent they havent quit theyve shown some fight here as uh and also I think a twopointer is what were Music told so our score is correct Music here the lead is eight chain fouled there by Jets to the fourth foul on James and theres a theres a perfect example and you can tell the guys Huntley Hatfield theyre all looking at him Alexis gets the ball you want to foul the big guy he is over hand shot thr also not I mean its a long shot that youre going to extend this game but you dont want to get James his fourth foul correct Shady the line he is two for two from the line so far tonight he has 18 points 14 of those 18 in the second half and the Freshman Guard from Los Angeles with a chance to put the mo back up by 10 if he can hit them both he hits the first one to make it a ninepoint game 16 from the field Jody yeah hes got he he has got to be the one guy Trey white better in the second half only four of 12 but again these two guys combin nine of 28 for white and Clark they have got to shoot the ball better for Louisville to be in any game on their schedule much less against the better teams as they get going P Clark with a Miss on the front end of the one and one and the rebound by Randy Brady and hell get two shots at the other end as the mocks are now in the double bonus Randy Brady a 65 sophomore from Chattanooga knocks in the second free throw to extend that lead to 11 I got to say heres one thing so impressed with Dan Earl and this team and how well they are coached this is a Chattanooga team thats got a ton of new parts and theyre going to win a lot of games this season CLS three off the front of the rim zi with a rebound and another foul on trainer and yon zic who I mentioned a second ago Jody two points just two minutes ago and hes right now has seven points five rebounds impressed that coming off the 25p point effort in the open but he didnt force anything tonight no he did not he he let the offense go to some other guys who were hot and Shay with H 20 points puff with 25 thats five on Mike James oh no that was five on trainer I was say why is Mike James I thought they caught it on trainers showed its a little spurt seven points though in hes got 20 minutes of mat hes got to be more consistent though thats what they need from him he can give them energy he likes to get the dunks he can get on the rebound hes actually shooting the ball better from threepointer hes got to be hes got to be more consistent for Louisville misses the first free throw but hey they miss a shot in the second half huh goodness gracious seems like 577 from the field including six of 11 from three maybe theyll celebrate on their way home with some sugars ribs in Chattanooga if youre driving through there make sure you stop James with the three gets it to go and Mike James now with 17 points that was a six triple of the night for the cards and another F really at this point well its not one rather its not a rather if you foul or not its if youre going to foul why waste another 3 or 4 seconds you know what I mean like and thats the thing and Coach Payne I think was telling them to foul right there Chay with a chance to increase his career high already 20 points for the Freshman make it 21 after a fourpoint first half good to see him back out there though cuz that injury looked like it might be pretty serious the way he went off the floor into the locker room spins that one around 22 points for him 47 for the box back court here tonight Trey white forces one up hes going to get a foul call from across the court I think his foot was over the line though by the time he shot it so well see if he gets two shots or three two shots for Trey white with 28 seconds left here the one thing hes really done well tonight is shoot free throw 707 for the line the cards though with just 18 free throw attempts after 39 the other night and if theyre not going to hit threes and theyre playing against the team whos going to hit 14 of them theyre going to have to be a little more aggressive going to the basket and get some fouls and some more opportunities at the line so white with 16 points and hell get two more free throws here and ends his perfect night at the line yeah some of the things they did well the other night they havent shown
