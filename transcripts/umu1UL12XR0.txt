I think might be one of the surprises of the league Stanfords happy to have their ball hand their back in Jaylen Blakes and Georgia Tech theyre just going to give theel a chance because of how hard they play and compete theyre always going to be in the game Benny geler also available for stand for Georgia Tech still battling injuries they win the tip here on their home court or theyve won 10 times this season shot inside blocked at The Rim AR you even see in the beginning just what Blakes does defensively just makinging George make a little quicker of a decision it definitely messes up the Rhythm Georg atack offensively by Dongo has been playing really good basketball for George attack here Stanford starting five sellers agar wall Blakes young Reno on the attack agal his shot against NC State over the weekend the game you called Eric was the game winner size at the guard position for agarwall and AG he did a great job of Distributing the basketball had eight assists in that game and really got comfortable late in the second half really making plays for his teammates George Sutton Dongo Suare Powell Duncan Powell an unsung hero for the jackets over the last Applause month two nothing early Reno he can shoot it from out there firing away off to the left rebound George he can shoot it out there but hes more effective going inside really setting the tone and with being inside presence and thatll open out his outside game even more George not there on the midrange Dongo hit one from that spot that one the bank open here on this Wednesday night and AR D was a guy that they thought was going to bring more offensive Firepower this season they thought he was going to take that step up if he can be more consistent on the offensive end thats just going to be even more better for Georgia te four nothing early for the jackets got off to a good start against Louisville in their last home game right now crafty draws the foul the Frenchman against Suare all D what do you want to see for both of these teams to get a w tonight well keys for Georgia Tech they have to be physical without fouling dont they dont have a lot of bodies and they have to get out in transition you dont want to play against a set half court defense every single time for Stanford control the temple they rather play in that half court setting having a guy like Rayo and Blakes make decisions and then take care of the basketball I think having Jaylen Blakes back will really help Stanford cut down on those Applause turnovers shot was partially blocked great defense here from Blakes you see the size 62 started his career at Duke active defense by the car dont they force the turnover are you already jayen Blakes having an impact on this game with his defense hasent played in a couple weeks how do you get yourself into the game on the defensive side of the ball just bring energy and effort great job defensively by Jaylen Blakes what a job Kyle Smith has done here in his first season at Stanford last years Pack 12 Coach of the Year at wazo fun catching up with him and Damon STM today about their West Coast Conference days in the matchups some absolute Wars going on over there on that West Coast besides the two being great coaches just really two great guys that college basketball has and it was great just having a conversation with him chopping it up one thing Damon STM wanted to do you see him there right on your screen and his team is fighting for him they wanted to disrupt Stanford here this evening on their home courtner well last weekend you saw Stanford they had trouble with North Carolina States pressure so I think Georgia Tech they want to be physical defensively they want to get up and pressure the ball and see if they can cause turnovers and create those turnovers going down in transition George crosscore pass Dongo has been playing much better over the last five games stripped inside staying with it angling not there right now the best rebounder in the ACC one of the best in the country able to rip it down despite that Miss by Dango how about the pass from Nathan George I people dont see that lefthanded over hook pass thats a hard pass to make right there eighth consecutive start for Donovan young he kicks it out right now Euro Step not able to convert good active hands in the contest from the jackets they swarmed to the Frenchman and every time time he gets the ball hes going to see bodies and I think Georgia Tech rather have have him shoot those type of shots rather than be right by the rim and get opportunities close to it jackets doing a nice job on the boards early on shot blocked good defense there from the Cardinal coming away with it as Blakes inside drives hes fouls one of the best in the conference at getting to the line hell go to the charity strike for two well he showed in these first four minutes just how good of a defensive player he is hes causing Havoc at the point of attack and you see right there with the block on pow and then he gets the ball and he goes down and attacks the rim putting pressure getting to the free throw line Stanford is just a different team with Jaylen Blakes out here the fou is on Duncan fou on Blakes top 10 in the ACC in assists per game top five in steals per game top 15 in scoring you see what the Cardinal missed what Kyle Smith was so happy to have back today shoot around when they saw him warming up but without Jaylen Blakes they cant really get out and play in transition its going to be a more of a slow Temple half court now with him in he could push the pace a little bit and then defensively theyre just a so so much better of a team with him guarding the point of attack Jaylen Blakes nearly 13 more points per game than a season ago could be in that most improved player race here in the ACC hes got to be a strong candidate Dongo attacks from the wing Fades and kicks George ball fade good ball movement pow wide open count it Pals a guy who has just continued to get better and better early on he took advantage of the injuries and he saw his opportunities and he just keeps getting better game by game been shooting the ball at a really high clip no doubt Ed 38 matter of fact an ACC play this season hes averaging 18 a game over his last six pow little contact there they say he got all ball Ron Grover Tim Clarity Rick Crawford the officials here tonight Music Ali that would have been a pretty finish you see Nate George he hes doing what he does whoa how about a finish there and its Donovan young with the hammer Donovan young he missed some few few games with injury this season but hes an athletic Wing hes versatile defensively and you see him right there just showing his athleticism attacking the rim stand from 42 on the year with young in the starting lineup the 68 freshman from Pasco washingon jackets by three in the early Applause going jackets have five conference wins on the year Stanfords got eight of them George clear path he finds the seam and lays it in George really has to look to be assertive on the offensive end and look to score in the ball you see with pow at the ball Stanford defense load enough they have to be able to make a quick decision and when you get the ball you have to be able to attack George leads the ACC an assist per game at over six a contest but over the last two games 48 combined points for George raino defense swarming by the jackets the double team came itll stay with Stanford nine to four early here for Georgia Tech de P right here knocking it down continuing his hot streak going and then on the other end D young send it home Sanford miss its first five shots from the floor to start this game Georgia attack three assists on four made field goals giler fre ball yes sir welcome back Benny giler welcome back eler another guy who could really handle the ball but you see him right there showing his out side range and knock it down to threepointer Junior from La has really shot the the ball well at Maples Pavilion but now 3000 miles away he knocks it down George didnt get the friendly home bounce heer will walk it up with G Tech by two would Stanford work its way onto the bubble Joe lunardi releasing an update earlier today foul on the floor number good job right here agar wall seeing him coming off the down screen and giler welcome back knocking it down 34 on the year for giler Miss the last two games due to flu like symptoms here he is again hes got one doesnt shoot it that time works off the screen three ball in the air agal no about it agall has really been struggling shooting the ball All Season 28 from three but hes known as a shooter so when he has open looks you want him to shoot the ball right there probably not as open as he thought he was and just a bad attempt right there by agrial second on the team in threepoint attempts on the year you see chis Makar checks in a St Stanford Squad whos shooting the ball well from Beyond The Ark and ACC play on the here 33 Applause as a team ball inside nice rotation they couldnt finish staying with it is Dongo hes a beast on the glass and you see why there Dango just changes the game by being active rim run be active around the rim get offensive rebounds you can have an impact just by doing that and you see how Stanford is doing a good job of keeping raino out of the pick and rolls they have him guard suon in the corner trying to keep him out of foul trouble heres bles on the wing R now multiple white Jers Js paying attention to him ball rotation oara stops kicks sellers three money oiah sers 40 from Beyond The Arc one of the best Shooters in the ACC all this is a guy sers who who really is capable of scoring the basketball at a high level he has to be more aggressive and look to set the tone early for himself hes been in double figures 18 of the last 20 games of the season a consistent Force for Kyle Smith Cardinal within one they force the turnover they have a chance for their first lead of the game at that point dangle you just got to try to make a move and be aggressive at The Rim you cant hold the Applause ball and its knocked away itll stay with Stanford jacket by one here on this cold rainy night in Music Atlanta number of injuries just piling up for both of those teams in you talk about guys like Terry and McCullum I mean thats 27 points per game between the two Kae Reeves has been out a while luk OBrien was supposed to be an experienced player coming from Colorado its been a challenging year for Damon STM but Ed theyve been fighting for him you got to credit coach STM and how he has these guys locked in and really buying into what he wants to do and again next man up mentality and you cant worry about whos not playing you got to worry about who you have and Coach St has done a great job of getting these guys to buy and really compete at a high level Eric you ask him simply whats been the key he said I think weve just been more physical as thats a great move and the Finish from Dongo another physical play there for the jackets being around the rim being present being available and then when you get it just go up and be aggressive at The Rim Nate George doing what he does being a playmaker and doo great hands they work on that in practice catching the ball and then just being aggressive finishing at The Rim giving yourself an opportunity for an add one jackets now have 10 points inside the paint here of their 13 see Dongo off to a really nice start 86 rebounds hes got three double doubles in his last six contest this is the way I think the Jacks expected Dongo to play for much of the year hes staying on the court less foul trouble here as it and if he can play like this and just add value on the offensive side of the ball Georgia Tech is a totally different team they need him to be consistent what stood out about the jackets on tape as you prepared for this one like you talk theyre just being physical defensively they have Playmakers they have shot makers and they have to really try to get out in transition and play fast and make decisions and make shots they dont always want to play against a half court set defense its tough for any team to be able to have to do that every time foul steps into a triple you bet time out Stanford Howell and Dongo have combined for 15 points early on for the jackets of those 17 rest of the team one for six for two points the ram Rex hit both shots from Beyond The Arc those are both pows Stanford still I think trying to figure themselves out here on the east coast to get some shots up at Mish well Georgia Techs doing what Georgia Tech does theyre playing physically on the defens side of the ball and then George is doing a great job of getting into the paint drawing the defense and making plays and guys are knocking down shots its funny Kyle Smith head coach for Stanford basically told us on the road you got to hit shots theres really no key to it its as simple sometimes as need to make your shots yeah thats I mean lets keep the the game of basketball is simple when you miss shots its tough to win when you make them its easier to win they made their shots against Carolina up four pass there its their only win on the East Coast on the year obviously the headlines was Jaylen Blakes and the game winner there at the dean jump but for Kyle Smith in his first season they found ways to be competitive theyve battled the injury bug themselves theyve also battled Max right now and all the focus and attention hes getting on opposing scouting reports they continue to draw plays to win games 16 of them on the year eight of them in ACC at this game right now they they have to find a way to get raino in more excuse me effective spots on the court in in the half court set this is getting the ball too far away from the rim or not getting it at all mustaf back in there he missed six games freshman from Maryland thats a good sign for the jackets r no a three ball hes a little off right now huh oh for three I mean theyll live with that Jordan Tech theyll live with him shooting the basketball can he shoot the basketball yes but you have to set the tone offensively by being aggressive attacking the rim and then your perimeter game will open up more a defense into offense and Blakes just couldnt finish its just a little bit rust he hasnt played in a little bit but hes done a great job coming out here and just giving maximum effort Cardinal scoring drought now of over 3 minutes hope for their last five from the floor but offenses for Stanford they have to be in attack mode if youre not going to get Reno the ball where he can be effective Sellers and Blakes have to find ways to create off the pick and roll or attack but when theyre moving the the ball side to side and they can find those angles to get into the paint Dongo at that free throw line back door cut oh my mustaf showing you High Above the Rim what he can do and mustaf the guy whos just coming back in his first game after being hurt for a while but hes a guy that could really bring a lot offensively attack in the rim as you see there with the hammer dunk but defensively hes strong he moves his feet well and hes a great defender Blue Chip recruit was boost off from overtime Elite jackets by nine an 80 run pow good defense there from Young he muscles it up hes foul out and dcan Powell will go to the Music line Georgia Tech right now theyre just being the aggressor you see Musto just hammering it down on sellers right now a great pass right there but just being strong at being the aggressors at The Rim Stanfords not being aggressive on the offensive side of the ball and Georgia Techs really doing a great job getting out and being aggressive towards the rim it was a spirited shoot around earlier today for Georgia Tech Damon Sodom you could hear him pleading with this team this is go time we got a toughen up we got to get be together we got to find ways to be able to win basketball games theyve shown in spurts what theyre capable of the injuries have bitten them a couple of times this season but the jackets capable of doing so much more theyre really only playing with six guys maybe seven everyone has to be locked in when they get on the court its not about scoring the basketball its about what can I do to help this team win games defensively rebound the basketball dive on the floor whatever it is coach dmire has got his guys locked in and playing their roles he knows got no points nearly 12 minutes into this game wide open look clean top of the key you bet theres oiah sers Alli hes a guy who I think really has to be more aggressive offensively for Stanford so much of the offensive load goes to R you have to take some pressure off him with other guys score in the basketball sell is just one of those guys strong drive from George hell go to the line we come back to mamish I think dork Tex is being active theyre flying around theyre being physical like the the theyre right there on the catch Stanford just has to get that ball movement side to side and then they have to be aggressive when when a team is being aggressive defensively you have to attack that pressure they have to get downhill and then when they get by they have to see the opportunity and make the right decision meanwhile Nate George knocks down a pair of free throws got four points to go along with three rebounds and three assists are Georgia Tech doing a little bit of what North Carolina state did last weekend picking the ball Up full court just pressure him a little bit just making a little bit different a little bit more difficult for Stanford bringing the ball up spending some more energy he got within 8 ft there Dongo though strong on the defense Dongo has been a menace on the pick and roll got caught in no mans land Sutton able to save it out of the sky Powells been hot so far left it short that time long rebound to Sutton Second Chance coming for the jackets George Slams on the brakes 10 on the shot clock steps back calls his own number from three too strong oh Collision there players hit in the deck a foul is that going to go against Sutton believe it well seemed like Blakes had gotten to the basketball well we talked about Coach star what hes saying like we got to be physical defensively theyre attacking the glass theyre missing shots theyre going after the rebounds Georgia Tech is just setting the tone defensively being aggressive then offensively theyre attacking the paint creating opportunities D and STM talked about the win against Clemson right three overtime youre thin on the bench everybody had to play a role Nathan George was phenomenal of course Duncan Powell the heroics at the end to force overtime at Little J Dongo fantastic in the overtime periods its not an easy place to win a basketball game Agro walls three that misses anytime you beat Clemson at Clemson its loud I mean Duke couldnt do it over the weekend it just goes to show you what this Georgia Tech team is capable of and just think if they had a full roster I mean theyd really be rolling but Dam sare again hes just done a great job of getting these guys to Buy in and look when youre competing and playing at a at a high level playing as hard as you can youre going to give yourself a chance and then these guys got talent they got Playmakers they got guys who can make shots Georgia Tech has really been playing good basketball as of L George clean look from the wing he connects the consistency that Nate George has been playing with now as hes really grown in a sophomore season yeah Im just Im really impressed by Nate George he he was a little bit more just just a playmaker and now you see he has to step it up and be a score and hes done just that nice move there is that what gets Reno going you hope so he he just has to be aggressive keep it simple when you get the ball be aggressive when you hold it too long Georgia Tex going to come with that double team foul forcing the action on agar wal hes guilty of the foul AR again Georgia Tech is just being aggressive theyre not waiting on it theyre getting the ball and theyre attacking raino good job off the dribble two feet in the paint those are the shots that he needs to get close to the rim and then youll get the opportunities away from the rim when you attack the paint now the defense collapses in a little bit more and it just gives you more perimeter opportunities Kyle Smith prays maxray knows love of learning different ways to play this game as pal knocks down the first want to remind you our first mens lacrosse game of the season its right here on acc Network in the ESPN app number seven Virginia hosting Richmond at clockner Stadium coverage begin Saturday morning at 1130 am eastern mcole cner by the way number nine The Graduate transfer for Stanford the ACC defender of the year at Virginia fourth round draft pick of the PLL maybe hell get into the game here tonight Applause Tech by 13 Powell really strong first half great defense again from Georgia Tech Tech just has bodies all around the ball not even give him a chance to see it and theyre just playing harder than Stanford right now hows in double figures hes got T with the basketball now to George onto the wing mustaf pretty move in the kick three ball missed everything Dongo trying his hand from Beyond the O probably not you know the shot that they want Dongo to take can he make it yes hes capable but they want him to stay where hes more comfortable around the rim this is 12 threepoint attempt on the year R now size is pow up cant connect from the midrange what Georgia Tech has done a great job is is thrown raino his rhythm is off a little bit all right so he started the game shooting jump shots now hes falling in love with you have to attack it off the initial just go try to get to the rim try to get fou youre not going to make every single one but be aggressive set the tone by being aggressive foul on geler Stanfords missed nine of their last 11 shots from the floor and are really just settling for jump shots that surprising you well that just goes to show you what Georgia Tech is doing theyre being physical theyre getting up and theyre not making anything easy for stord George is able to stay on his pivot foot heres mustaf 1 V one against giler has a size at Advantage Reno came to help in support but foul cols its on giler and another thing Georgia Tech is doing well as theyre seeing the mismatch they see mustaf has a size advantage against giler put your head down get to the basket and draw a foul opportunity to make two Damon STM talked about Jaden mustaf and said weve been working on him get a little nastier get a little mean Edge to him hes been improving as of late and you saw that RSE Throwdown with some mean intentions as he knocks down the first of two free throws top 100 recruit was mustaf coveted by many programs theyre high what this rookie can do here for the yellow Jacks Ill tell you one thing just having played basketball at a high level one thing that you could do to really separate yourself is just compete as hard as you can but compete with the edge not saying you got to be nasty but you got to go out there and play with a chip on your shoulder it it just gives you a little bit more of an advantage when you have that mindset nobody knows Edge like Eric dendor I I played with a little bit of edge I loved it right now on the dry foul calls so youre seeing Maxim start to try and make it an emphasis to get downhill and get to the rim get to get to spots where you can be most effective if you can catch it in that free throw line area turn and rip and get to the basket youre going to be more effective now you knock down some free throws you see the ball go through the hoop maybe then you could extend it out and hit hit some jump for some threepoint opportunities fouls on Dongo thats his first attack fifth but again just being aggressive theres not many bodies over there on that Georgia Tech bench if youre aggressive and you get dle in fou trouble Advantage Stanford righto top of the key against Dongo rotates it young young back to Reno three ball launch thats off forcing the issue its just a good shot and then they got cam down there on the post they should really switch it and put him at the high post and then get raino down there so he can get more easy attempts at The Applause Rim Kyle Smith was concerned with the length and athleticism Georgia Tech possesses that its going to be tough on us to hit some shots if we could get to the paint oh baby on the drive mustto had one he was looking for yet another tell you what if youre going a foul though thats what you do stf make sure you get your moneys worth yeah absolutely but Stanford just fell asleep you know they were they didnt know where the ball was and you see right here just good job by MV again attacking the rim with authority being aggressive another chance to make two free throws foul on Aiden C and jackets theyve been pretty aggressive getting downhill have found some success getting to the rack against Stanford here in this first half and are now you know what thats going to do for them now the defense comes in a little bit tighter now that you have those opportunities for those threepoint shots but jorgia Tech guards are doing a good job of just getting downhill getting paint touches and thats going to collap the defense and create other opportunities as the game goes forward roaf misses the free throw splits him Georgia attacks up 16 important four minutes here for Stanford try and close out the half you want to try to close the half if you can get into single digits or or or 10 points or lower but Jordan Tech has really just punched Stanford in the mouth they really set the tone since the beginning of the game sers midrange jumper short Jack just Clos down driving Lanes here for Stanford well its all George attack here on their home court on their home court playing with juice playing physical and just playing hard those basketball giler he already hit one three that time not there rebound pal his fourth rebound to go along with those 10 points jackets have been pulling away over the last8 minutes you see theyre on the right side of your screen with a 16point lead Georgia Tech can kind of be a little bit more not loose with the ball but they can be patient offensively they dont have to force anything they have to look for the open opportunity not a bad pass right there by pow looking for matmo Music Applause Reno three ball back iron boy just been that kind of first half for maxim Reno I just dont like how hes falling in love with with the jump shot right now we know you can shoot the ball but you have to find a way to really get in there closer to the rim Im saying it every single time but be aggressive at The Rim get opportunities closer right know 0 for four from Beyond The Arc one of four inside the arc on his twoo try mustaf pretty what a finish deep in his back Jaden Musta talked about how capable he is off the dribble getting to the basket and using that big strong body to create space and that was a tough one put I guess you would call it a floater or a runner in the lane mustaf he Georgia Tech is happy to have him back you had one of those back in your day I had a few of those left hand right hand get to the Lane good spin on the backboard I could I could do that interesting drive there from Cayman who seemed like he had a clear path and then tried to draw some contacts and it goes AI in the edge stay with the Cardinal it was a good job by him just being aggressive off the pump fake and looked like he lost his footing a little bit right there wasnt able to get it up to the rim how he wanted aen came right turn freshman from Music Massachusetts deep three attempt off to the left Stanford really shoot struggling to shoot the basketball just 19 now in this first half they are three of 14 from beond The Arc an exasperated Kyle Smith Georgia Tech guards are doing a good job of getting up getting under not letting them get downhill and turn the corner Stanfords Gars are playing side to side theyre just going to get those type of looks every single time little over two minutes to play in this opening stanza from Mish Ali Dongo caught it out of the sky stayed with and stuck it in how about George recognizing that Stanford goes to his Zone great job by Dano getting behind the defense George doing what he does making a great pass Dango good job coming down with it being on balance and going up and finishing oh how about that play foul call as well Donovan young went skywalking for a moment there this is what Stanford has to do they have to get more opportunities at the rim and theyre known as a really good cutting team Doan young if he can get those opportunities at The Rim hes athletic enough to either dunk on you or if he doesnt make it hell have opportunity at the line hes been an unsung hero here for Stanford and Kyle Smiths Club had a career high nine points four rebounds against UNC converts the and one its been a big boost youve seen him a couple times now plays with that edge so versatile as well the way you can match him up defensively yeah versatile defensively he can guard bigs and guards hes pretty mobile but in a game like this you need those guys to step up and and bring you something until your key guys really start to play how theyre supposed to Turning sudden left hand that rattles out offensive rebound Dongo nearing a double double just in this first half he lost the handle a is a timeout being called indeed quick break jacket that jacket off and and Ill tell you this Arya they sold that jacket for 15000 and they ra so they raised 15000 so I I guess it ended up working out he made it bad a good into a good so it worked out for it wonder whats going through his mind as he enters the hollow grounds one of the greatest of all time man six on the clock for gers sellers contested three rattles out offensive rebound second chance now coming for the Cardinal kick Music bolt whats going through Kyle Smith and Damon steyers heads right now well Damon St is a little bit more comfortable than than coach Smith is right now but if you look at the lineup for Stanford on the floor right now whos the guy to score the basketball you really look at Sellers right here as he comes off the screen thats what he has to do when you catch the ball be decisive if you have an opportunity for a jump shot shoot it if not attack the rim sers loves that midrange game so proficient in it 12 points against ncy state in that win over the weekend he leads Stanford with eight points so far in this first half cinal within 15 crosscore pass Powell pum fake pulls up attacks the rim with some heat offensive foul nice work from K moving his body moving his feet and getting in a position stford needs a few more of those they have to get a bucket here to end the half just to feel good about themselves going in every time I I see George make that lefthanded pass Im like theres not a lot of people that can make that pass but good job by came in just coming over meeting him outside of the paint being there drawing the charge 10 seconds here for Stanford theyve got one last shot gerer turns the corner tries to get into the teeth of the defense with three fading away fires it rattles out thats not going to matter for young Talent STS guy Jack Eis doing a great job here tonight right next to me here in mamish Pavilion tner fips Arthur Kai entire control room all of our cameras Mario mudi Eric dandorf this has been a lot of fun those first 20 minutes these first four minutes for Stanford right out of the gate of the second half going to be important double team got to get something up with five on the shot clock they dont get anything up turnover and he gets the ball where he wants to get it but then Georgia comes with the double team right away somebody has to realize this and be able to send Cutters down the middle great job by Don goare just swarming the ball and just making it tough to even see anything for rno you just saw Kyle Smith say it he said what the blank was that looking at his assistance I mean George attack has got the Cardinal flustered youre going to youre going to have the players flustered youre going to have the coaches flustered when youre playing this type of Defense flying around active being physical said he got to be disruptive George on the back door cut had a deflected turns faces fade away oh my Nate George we see you I and I tell you what when youre playing basketball at a high level when youre competing as hard as you can stuff like that happens shots start to fall like that all right need to see more jayen Blakes right here in the second half moves like that one turn the corner get downhill attack the basket aggressively we know hes try to work his way back but you really dont have any time for that AR you got to be aggressive towards the basket and create opportunities hes got four points to go along with three assists in his first game back from injury George hot to start the half feeling good and he just told jayen Blakes sir do not go underneath that screen I can shoot the basketball did you see him hold the follow through an extra second hes feeling good Donovan young triple no rebound Coral theres dangos double double his 10th rebound his 12th career double double already sixth this season four in his last seven as well Nathan George has just been playing at a high level Jay Blakes if you go underneath that screen the way Nathan George has been been playing hes going to knock that down every time we talked to Nate George earlier today and he was talking about the leadership mantle put on his shoulders he said its weird cuz Im just a soft more but Ive had to do it by necessity he said Ive learned a lot Im growing a lot and Im a guy that I think a lot of people see my passing ability and they just think Im a pass first guard and I am but I can put the ball in the bucket too well the makeup of this Georgia Tech Team right now they need Nathan George to be more aggressive scoring the basketball and he has definitely been doing that good pass from Reno crosscourt to Young he gets inside tries to throw it off the glass awkward there and then a foul called on Cayman against Powell well you said it awkward off balance you get to the hoop you want to play off two feet strong and go up those shots like that youre not going to get good opportunities going to the rim shooting off balance shots but again you got to credit Georgia Tech defense just being physical and throwing Stanfords Rhythm off offensively second foul on Cay and disruption that was Damon sodoms key to the game that was the first thing you asked what do you got to do to win got to be disrupted and theyve been consistent being disruptive every single defensive possession the Stanford really hasnt been able to find any clean looks the teams that have had success against Stanford have been able to make him uncomfortable and have just been physical with them well tonight so far a lot of time left you can check that box if youre the jackets up 18 heres pal back door cut Dongo two one and the buzzer blocked by raino its a positive defensive possession for Kyle Smiths Club well you want to build off something thats Stanford getting the turnover and then being able to get another opportunity offensively down here but you have to be clean cleaner offensively if youre Stanford but you see right here just good job by raino getting out there contesting the shot Georgia Tech obviously not doing their themselves a favor by going with three seconds left on the shot clock hamper does have those six blocks raging up the defensive intensity Force two turnovers already now in this half right there you have to see him cuz hes going to only be open for a split second you have to see him and get him the ball if not Georgia Tex to cover that up lock shot 3 seconds on the clock out of bounds itll stay at Stanford how about the effort there from Daren sudden AR the way that Georgia Techs moving around and theyre flying around when Rayo does do a good job of getting open its only going to be for a split second so his teammates has to see him and they have to get him the ball inside turning geler at the buzzer fading away missed everything felt like Cameron Grant had an opportunity right when he caught it just two seconds to go up with it on that left block and you know what the Georgia Tech defense does is you might have those opportunities that where you where you think youre open but just the way that Georgia Techs been playing defense throughout this game youre not seeing those opportunities like you would because theyre being so physical so theyre just throwing Sanfords whole Rhythm off and being disruptive ow now George topping the key against gerer takes him inside turns to his right hand Fades away strong move couldnt finish gerer arals the loose ball with Georgia Tech again theyre theyre seeing the mismatch they know Nathan George could take giler off the dribble and then theyre just seeing that and attacking it right up with a left hand touched Above the Rim was it still on the Music basket Kyle Smith was asking for a goal 10 so for the points to count official there is an official timeout and get a little bit more intense you got to create some turnovers defensively if you can and then hopefully get out and transition and get some easy opportunities but once you get into half court again you got to try to find some easier opportunities at The Rim or just get some paint touches to create those foul on Dongo thats just his second you draw from any experiences back at your qes days oh absolutely I I remember my freshman year 2006 when we we went on an incredible run four wins in four days shout out to my guy Jerry mamir he had an incredible tournament but were playing against Georgetown down 15 at half Roy hiber Des Shanti cook Brandon Bowman those guys we got fired up at halftime coach said of few Choice words to us and we came out it it just gave the effort that you needed to give to come back in into that ball game and you got to create turnovers you you got to get easy opportunities at the rim and then when you start to see those it just makes it a little bit easier for you we all certainly enjoyed watching you play that AllAmerican career at huse oh gerer hasnt been able to find his touch from the outside but young has been giving you a boost for the Cardinal well this is what talking about the little hustle plays attacking the offensive glass just just giving yourself extra possessions extra opportunities and now St for has to take advantage and knock down free throws Five Points four rebounds for young GE Tech did struggle against Virginia in the loss over the weekend at the jpj on the glass specifically geordan uh excuse me Virginia over 40 of their misses they grabbed 11 offensive rebounds that was a big key in the second half Cavaliers pulled away for that win in Virginia theyre just play Super efficient basketball they had 21 assists they took care of the basketball and they didnt give Georgia Tech any second chance opportunities softball season is back and its rolling on with the Shriners childrens Clearwater Invitational ACC network is the home for these four games starting with Kentucky and Virginia tomorrow afternoon at 2 Eastern and then the final match up will be

in softball and youre starting to see fruits of their labor Sanford within 16 40 24 this is the intensity they need they need to start pressuring up on the ball and make Georgia Tech make quicker decisions hopefully create a turnover Dongo too strong do what you do well Dango get the ball down low and then turn and be aggressive towards the rim use your athleticism hes got 13 and 11 29 career games now in double figures for Music Applause B Georg attack just eating inside the paint 20 points nearly 50 of their output theyve made life miserable on Max right out turns faces thats more like it from Max and great players are going to make tough shots right youre not going to hold him down the whole game but you got to see what po did hes being physical he pushed him out he makes him catch it farther away from basket REO just made a tough shot hes a great player leads the ACC in points and rebounds Nations leader with 20 double doubles on the year Dongo nice move did everything but the Finish just a different dle that Ive seen last time I did the Georgia Tech game at Notre Dame hes being physical hes using his athleticism and hes just being aggressive around the rim how about the effort there from Ibrahim Suarez fou call you see guys on the ground theyre clapping it up theyre cheering for each other this is what coach stmm has really turned this Georgia Tech basketball team and he hes really trying to develop a culture in his second season and how do you build a build a program L guys are but not George attack sometimes they only have six guys available but all six you see it earlier literal Blood Sweat and Tears I I I never knew what it was like to quit I mean if once I step in between those lines youre given everything you got 100 effort and you just like to see teams play like that its really good to see Georgia Tech just giv effort and energy maximum MOA Dongo clock winding down follow up sudden slams it home how about Suare again just being active around the rim being available the double team comes on Dango Suare is there to clean it up and finish it Ibrahim Suare from Guinea his mom watches every game religiously back in their home country of getting the double team comes on indago with this s comes off his back says hey I got you my guy Imma clean it up for you ibraim nine points 12 assist in that win that triple overtime Thriller at Clemson he has continued to grow here in his retro freshman campaign George attacked by 18 here on Fowler Street on the attack layup is good athletic from Blakes thats a great job by Blakes just turning the corner and dangle just a little bit late which allowed Blakes to get get to the rim and finish D has to meet him outside of that pain a little bit further away George Dongo turning Reno knocks it away multiple bodies hit the deck see right there an example of where when you get the ball if youre an IND Dango do not put it on the ground just go straight up the minute you put it on the ground hands are in there and thats what caused the turnover or jump Applause ball and to put a fresh 30 back on OPP possession arrow going the other way thats what you see coach St talking about just go up when you get that close to the rim you got a smaller guy on you turn and go Applause up heres Blakes eyeball screen set he uses kick ball but the jacket slow it down but just a great job by Georgia Tech playing the pick and roll on the pick roll you want to try to create that Advantage so you can get downhill Jordy Tech doing a good job pushing it to the side Stanford has nothing whats the key to a good hedge well just being able to get out there having a good timeing I think playing him to that sideline you dont want to open up and let him get downhill Jord Tech doing a good job of playing good angles but then most importantly just being physical that has been the theme tonight for Damon Styers jackets looking for their sixth ACC win of the year this would be considered a pretty good victory they got a couple of wins Over Louisville and Clemson Ager wal nope hes had a tough night and if if youre not able to get downhill youll have that guy sliding up they have to be able to hit that shot right there thats another opportunity Nate George look ARA hes feeling himself right now I would be too hes got 15 third M triple R now top of the key that rattles out offensive rebound Agro boy its been a struggle you never have those nights where everything you throw up even the ones that you felt good out of your hand just not going down not many humble BR humble youre allowed to say that thats a good answer offensive fell well Eric dandorf I watched you rip the Nets today its shooter out Nate George his best Eric dandorf impr pruss Nate George is playing with super confidence right now you go under hes knocking it Music down so had an knack for putting the ball on the bucket who were guys you grew up watching my my favorite alltime player and I got to meet him Allen Iverson just just a guy who was Fearless it didnt matter who was guarding him he was getting to the cup hed get knocked down hes getting right back up I just tried to model my game or really the effort that he played with I tried to you know model my game after that ironically Kyle Smith said Georgia Tech reminds him of preparing for like the 01 76ers and Nate George like Allen Iverson in terms of what he does for the rest of his team and having those bigs down low Nathan George is the leader and everybody else is is playing their role and theyre gritty theyre physical theyre not afraid to get on the floor you need to have th those type of guys on your Applause Music Applause team gayer continues to fire from Beyond The Arc hes now one for five and I just think right now hes hes getting the ball right there and then hes waiting until the double team comes you have to get it before the double team com and try to attack that oneonone I know two for T here tonight young steps into a triple back iron pow comes away with it his seventh rebound hes on double double watch too and that look Georgia Tech will let young shoot that shot thats not really what he Music does Damon Sodom wants to talk about it his tape in Cru he has been there throughout this whole game they set the tone from the jump ball and Stanford just hasnt been able to find any rhythm offensively George was looking for the alley was blocked by the rim probably had an opportunity just to go up right there Blakes able to connect hes got eight these are the opportunities that they need AR you they need to be able to get out and get transition opportunities and finish those buckets at The Rim try to find some momentum to build on Kyle Smith said Jaylen Blakes could be a great coach someday or a senator or president IQ kid just a really good kid to have on your team way hes handled this season for Stanford the transition into the ACC been phenomenal started his career at an AC former ACC School Duke excuse me with the Blue Devils former player I should say for the Duke Blue Devils Damon inside able to muscle it up in in anytime you get the ball in that blue area thats called the paint for everybody watching when you get it in the paint the defense collaps a little bit if they dont come and help you have a oneonone opportunity in that area stand for now with 16 points Georgia attack little scoring drought and its ended by Nate George what a night for the sophomore hes just is in that mode where you cant guard me he he sees G giler guarding him and then he smells blood and hes just attacking every single Applause time bank open chakara high off the glass and I thought for Stanford okara would be a guy that would have a little bit more impact this game especially with the physicality that Georgia Techs playing with you see he has that body type to be able to play through the contact play with that physicality go ahead Bank One in then get get yourself going a little bit had 12 points last week in the games against wake and NC State 12 points on average 14 against the wolf pack and 10 against Inc against WG Forest thats going the other Ways got some really good players in the NBA right now Brook Lopez Dwight Powell zire Williams Spencer Jones the Hawks are playing tonight against the Knicks Applause on the drive it will be long to stay with Stanford well despite the miss those are the opportunities that Stanford has to get by the rim it really should have been a finish but good job by Chism just attacking off the sweep and getting to the rim he created the Georgia Tech defense of shift then they add an advantage on the offensive boards D it St back not there either two looks for the Cardinal no leverage right there you caught it off balance standing straight Applause up heres mustaf Georgia Tech up 14 doesnt feel like theyre completely out of the woods yet on the drive mustaf cant connect Georgia Tech struggled offensively here in the second half give Stanford some credit theyve amped up their defensive effort Stanfords not going to quit playing they they got to get stops I mean ideally they want to try to get turnovers to get over get in transition and get easy opportunities its been a struggle for them scored in the half court but when they do get in half court they got to get paint touches be aggressive towards the rim bles has had a nice second half inside to Rena turns faces knock it down all right Cardinal within 12 well thats what you have to do its a good job by Blakes getting into an angle where he can get a good Post Feed and R know what hes been doing a good job or what he hasnt been doing a good job is getting it going right up right there he did a great job on the catch just going straight up all strips two on one Blakes attacks fouled mustaf thought he got ball these are the opportunities we talked about Stanford creating defense turning into offense pushing it in transition getting opportunities at The Rim get fouled now an opportunity to knock down two free Music throws great job creating the turnover and just being aggressive at The Rim Jaylen Blakes giving himself an opportunity at the foul line Georgia atts got eight turnovers in this half they have struggled to protect the basketball Dongo in those in that foul trouble hes got four of them common thing for him what an ACC Network womens basketball triple header we have for you tomorrow night tonight Isaiah James and NC State host Miami at 6 Eastern then Hannah hialgo and number two Notre Dam take on pit tonight is capped by cuse in Stanford from Maples going to be a lot of fun 600 800 1000 on the East Coast 700 for the Cardinal AR the last thing you want to do if your Georgia Tech is play conservative you still have to be aggressive looking to get looks at the basket not settling for jump shots that was a grown mans rebound from R now 71 you go up there and get it two hands pull it down big fella little 70 run has made this interesting in Atlanta on the attack way up yes Blakes a big second half for the Cardinal and this is the difference when Jaylen Blakes is in the basketball game when he was out they didnt have a guy to give the ball to and just say go ahead Jaylen Blakes can create with the ball in his hands the closest Stanford has been since the early part of the first half George step back jumper pure look Nathan George says calm down I got it give me the ball let me get a bucket they have to be sturdy on this end of the floor and then going back offensively they still have to be aggressive the Cardinal have hit five of their last eight shots here in the second half down 10 geler kick out three aara couldnt connect got a really good look it was a good opportunity you got to take that George slows things down hes got 19 points seven rebounds four assists hails from Toronto attacks pass finish ibraim Suare Harmon the rim you dont want to be conservative you dont want to stop playing you want to continue to be Applause aggressive should be an exciting finish from Mish here on Fowler Mario mudi Eric dindorf our entire crew Blakes had it knocked out Cal Duke its coming up Applause next Hooper flag in those Blue Music Devils theyre tough theyre tough I tell you that play defense at an exceptionally high level geler clean look yes Stanfords within single digits you just need a few of those and now you need to get come down here defensively and get a Applause stop dealer can really strug it from Beyond The Arc not shy to pull from there either great job by Stinson right there pushing him off that screen mustaf taking on Blakes seven on the clock 65 kick pow four three lost the handle two one fires in Lanes not there wanted a foul it might have been a foul but theyre not going to give him that call at that with the shot clock down three he really had nothing hell be the ACC Player of the Year and really using the running for National player of the year he just does everything for that Duke team pass dribble shoot but the biggest thing that I see when I watch Cooper flag play is hes the hardest working player on that court that guy competes at a high level not only is he a generational talent but he plays hard as heck out there and thats why hes going to be the number one pick in the NBA draft he really impressed against Clemson he was struggling two points in the game late in the second half and then just exploded into double figures he finished with at Drive finish aara Stanford is within seven these are these are the opportuni that they need they need to create turnovers into transition giler doing a good job of pressing up on George right there George has been handling it pretty well the whole game but giler getting his hand in there getting the steal George pick and roll Dango foul Colts slap it down on the ball was 33 Evan Stinson he 67 freshman great job by geler just creating the turnover getting out in transition and okar doing a good job of just finishing at The Rim you like Chism oars game I mean hes physical hes a transfer from Harvard he was really a big time scorer at Harvard obviously not in the same role with Stanford but hes a guy whos versatile defensively I think offensively he could shoot the ball hes not great at putting it down on the floor but he can get into that mid post area and he has some moves that he can get opportunities at the ri big free throw there from Dongo Baris sister jadea actually played tennis for Stanford back in 2023 transferred from an ivy league as well Dartmouth she has to be cheing for Geor Tech though right got me Applause there all right we see agall coming and we really havent seen him do much at all this game but if youre going to come in at this time you need to come in and step into a threepoint shot and knock one Music down hard within nine Dongo 15 and Applause 13 under three to play Blakes rotates it kick ball zch did a great job of just blowing up that play they tried to do a misdirection and get giler coming off that scream from Reno but George doing a great job of just pushing him off not letting him get any Music space who needs to touch the ball here well you got to put the ball in Jaylen Blakes hands and hes the guy whos really been creating offense for Stanford you havent heard much from sellers or any other the perimeter players and theyre doing a great job on REO sers has it on the wing aara free throw extended attacks Dongo kick REO three ball launches that rattles in and out oh man its just been that kind of night and when they when they started the game being physical with you those open opportunities dont seem as open as they really are its just been a struggle the whole game for REO hes over for six from theond The Arc just six points five rebounds Dongo finds the cutter knocked out of bounds stay with Georgia Tech seven on the shack Music clock Georgia Tech does a great job of flashing that guy to the middle and then Suare does a good job of being active on that back side when he catches in the high post being a cutter not a lot of time for Georgia Tech left on this possession just 7 Seconds got to go downhill you sudden realizes with four with three had the right idea good defense though from REO nice finish aara couple of really physical drives to the rim and better late than never use your physical presence your your big shoulders to get downhill youre playing through the contact youre capable of getting there be aggressive under two to play turnovers the Story the jackets in the second half has allowed Stanford to creep back in it George crafty oh that was clever and he drew the foul just a high being in control staying poison more times than not this game hes made the right decision floor General in every sense for Damon SAR Nathan George really started to flash at the ends of last season in his freshman year last four games average 16 points per game he knocks down a big free throw hes got 20 points his sixth career 20o performance and three straight now and that lights turned on and I think for Nathan George when he looks to be aggressive scoring the basketball it just it just opens up more opportunities for his teammates opportunities at the rim for everyone else coach Smith having a sideline conversation with with Arya just curious here is what we saw hes asking wait whats the strategy going on Applause here Applause 5848 oh man yeah he showed his athleticism right there great job coming from the weak side grabbing it with two hands May George was looking for nail in the coffin I I really like his game man how about Dango coming from the weak side and just showing his athletic ability two hands going up pined it on the glass you love jayen Blakes being aggressive but Dango not today my friend how about this performance 15 points 15 rebounds just being him being active being aggressive flying around hes going to have opportunities to get those rebounds to get those block shots and to have opportunities at The Rim score the basketball and theyve needed them right with those injuries you got to count on your preseason all ACC selection and by Dongo and he has stepped up for Damon stomy here over the last five or six games well he was hes a part of that big three that you talked about in the beginning are you talk about Nate George duck and Powell and and Dango those three guys need to be consistent for this Georgia Tech Team to have Music success now let doke coming up next here on acc network from Cameron get you there as soon as we can Georgia Tech trying to put the finishing touches win number 12 on the year one minute George with six now with a five step back kick Dongo three lets it fly two strong rebounds Blakes former Blue Devil geler from way downtown he launched that from Athens and on the Finish is oara Timeout time out stord over the weekend to take on Duke here comes the Trap George able to escape it for a a moment and a foul on Blake sudden had it hell go to the line for the one and one knocking down the free throws if your Georgia Tech seal the game number Kyle Smith talks about the pride his team takes in being solid we try to be pretty good at a number of areas tonight they just couldnt hit shots and ultimately if that is their undoing its just one of those games on the road you throw the ball up doesnt go down it started early and it continued Valiant effort in the second half to get things interesting and close Georgia Tech they were the enforcers here tonight well on the road you have to have all those little things go your way yeah Im talking about the offensive rebounds the block shots the hustle plays it was really Georgia Tech who set the tone right from the jump winning all those plays you see right there with Indo getting another weak side Block its just the effort and the activity that theyve shown Applause you got to love it if youre Damon sire what an effort tonight shorthanded yet again missing key players missing 40 points per game of production but George attack theyre going to protect their home court and its not like theyre doing this against the bottom of the league I mean Stanford is a is a quality opponent and we talked about Clemson and North Carolina and you know those teams that theyre being this Georgia Tech team is doing this with six Applause players and honestly Ron has been a nonfactor the whole game Georgia Tech did a great job of just limiting his touches being physical with him and really shutting him down a lot of fun here tonight Ed Georgia Tech 60 Stanford 52 Damon St Myers Club gets the job done Stanford just couldnt get out of that hole they climbed
