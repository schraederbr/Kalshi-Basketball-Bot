coming into this game North Carolina leads the alltime series they have dominated recently including seven in a row here in just not Hill Massachusetts and the opening tip is controlled by the visiting tar Hills 14 and three on the season 60 in conference play and 30 this year away from Chapel Hill they are all wins in the ACC and the big thing for them away has been defense and held all three FES on the road under 60 points and thats been something that really has been talked about with this team is wor their effort defensively great numbers ranked nationally Boston College is 11 and six two and four in conference play and 7 and2 on their home floor tough shot for Zachary hustling after the loose ball three players grabbing for it and that ball will stay with the Eagles on the hell ball situation M Lockton with the hustle for Boston College and interestingly enough that thats one category that North Carolina really has an advantage over BC is on the offensive glass but thats a great hustle getting on the floor and recycling The Possession for BC North Carolina is the best rebounding team in the conference over 41 boards per game M glockton bustling his way to the rim for Boston College well he had a fabulous home coming down in Georgia Tech 30 points so a little bit off in his last three games since but great start for him averages over 10 points per game forac Ryan to transfer from Notre Dame with the kick to Elliot kadoo one of the newcomers this season for North Carolina tried to flip it into the corner Zachary stepping in the passing Lane cell usually makes great decisions with the ball re turnover for him M locked it again and he lays it in took advantage of a mismatch inside great post up quick move thats seven points and eight boards in the win against Notre Dame on Monday Ryan fires away for three its off Target and the rebound from post a sellout crowd here at Connie Forum in Chestnut Hill corack Ryan knocked it away and the turnover for the heels RJ Davis too strong you know what you see on the other end and whats happening and uh post is a very good threepoint shooter BCs Center and with Bott lifted out there are going to be post up opportunities for other guys for BC inside and weve seen that here early Zachary fighting in the paint lost the handle to bot and now Davis Koo trying to get around Zachary challenged at the rim and he was fouled Elliot Kudo on the drive see the look right there just a big size difference Davis going right mton going right at him and then the quick spin inside very aggressive looking for his shot so Elliot Kau The Freshman from West Orange New Jersey will be at the free throw line 59 from the stripes so far this season starting his thir game and the thing with him hes had to earn that starting position didnt get it right at the start of the Season Tom but uh you know the he truly is a pass first point guard looks for his teammates and um you know what its done is I think more than anything has uh you know freed up RJ Davis some and and Davis certainly is playing like a player of the year candidate early on in the season one of two for kadoo from the Line North Carolina as a team is seventh in the conference at 45 from the floor and 76 fifth in the ACC from the line one number youd like to see go up for Kau only 59 from the free throw line Zachary looking for a safety Val Alik Bay pull up came up short to Bott leading rebounder in the ACC 10 and a half per game for Armando Bott his fingerprints all over the North Carolina record book Pau with a drive and scoop for Carolina and hes been pretty aggressive here early on looking for his offense especially getting to the rim theyve given him his right hand and hes taken advantage of it so three points early for kdo averages about seven per game post not afraid to fire away run down in the corner Ingram Davis got the defender in the air and hit the Baseline midrange just sloppy defense at time you cant bite on that punk fake and he actually had good size Harris went after that head fake great offensive move so BC might get a couple of early buckets trying to find the range on this possession Zacharys got some daylight gives it off Alik Bay with the righthanded hand wow Zachary you know I just love his presence out on the floor and great move he drew the defender inside it was a kind of a mini twoonone break next to denbe started entry B immediately double back to Ryan it is online slightly strong to post and they worked on off the dribble coming down big doubling on Bott trying to get the ball out of his hands worked that time go back Zachary on the handle post couple of feet behind the line and he rattles it in for a three ball and you will see that during the course of the game 44 from three for him I mean hes an excellent shooter everywhere but thats the plan to try to draw Bott out 25th May three of the season for post trying to defend on Ryan with a league Bay and it bounces out of bounds Boston College in the unselfish play from Jaden Zachary and the elevation from prins of Lake Bay with the jam for the Eagles this Sunday on CW womens Hoops Clemson clashes with Elizabeth kitley

and the Eagles have a 95 lead over the number four team in the nation the North Carolina Tar Heels who have not lost in conference play Boston College 2 and4 in ACC play after their win Monday at home against Notre D Earl Grant was very happy about his progress you know one of the games that theyve lost recently his team was sick um and didnt you know didnt have a great performance against Syracuse and uh but it really had you know came back played well Clemson lost that game but then you know had some had two good wins well hes you know hes had some he finally has some continuity in the program uh two three or four guys with three years experience coming back and you know a bunch of guys with two years experience so something to build on with this program two and two in their last four games for the eagles with a shot clock down to five for post trying to work on bot well defended by number five in Carolina blue you got to get something going toward the basket if you want to put pressure on bot to try to pick up some pop an immediate double on bot yeah and that get the ball out of his hands side rim and out of bounds and the Miss from Davis so a couple times that double team has worked to get the ball out in a Miss shot thing though I mean Bott in the Louisville game five assists so hes hes become a very good passer out of those double teams had 19 points on seven of 11 shooting in the game against the Cardinals who made a second half come back and cut the lead to five before North Carolina pulled away deflection and turnover Davis got the shot away speaking of Louisville Mike Jaylen Withers the Louisville Transfer is into the lineup for North Carolina Seth Trimble also in number seven yeah yeah I think he had had something for his old team double double against Louisville in that game that you mentioned and uh you know s of Hubert talked about how hes hes starting to feel more comfortable in his new environment and uh I think I think youre going to see more games like that from with now that is a rarity Mike a Applause Music miss so after that Miss its Bott moving up the list in rebounds all time in division one we keep an eye on his numbers as the afternoon presses Davis was 96 from the free throw line Mike best in the conference his percentage would probably plummet to 92 now hed only missed three All Season prior to that one yeah Im sure he can tell you every single miss that hes had so a threepoint lead for the Eagles and pop trying to cut to the rim ston wall by bacock well that last drive that he had though big thing he picked up a foul on post post got the pass from mson lays it in and he was fouled and he returns the favor and gets a gets a foul on Bott as well so a big threepoint play opportunity there you see early on they had post on the outside shooting threes and now they got him in and bayot maybe should have just let that one go he was beaten on the play and really had no chance to stop the uh the layup Quinton post the graduate student from Amsterdam in the Netherlands complet its the old school threepoint play originally transferring from Mississippi State again he missed that game at Clemson with an illness did not score in the game prior against Syracuse 17 in his last game against those three threes second half that arguably won the game for him Withers hits the jumper and Coach Grant told us that those post shots late in the second half were the difference in that Victory on Monday Applause first game of the season he scored 31 points thats the most by any player this season for the Eagles he drops it off to Prince cake Bay for the tomahawk Jam that was a great feed by post who was a little went in the air a little too far out for a shot but very unselfish in the league Bay now two dunks Trimble hes got a three in that corner yeah he was was uh he was really coming back from an injury last year you know and just uh feeling much better about his game ninth made three of the season for Trimble DC maintains the threepoint lead post got pushed and its going to be Withers well heres the play they tried going back to that same pick and roll and uh actually you know North Carolina defended the pick and roll very well but then the BC picked up the counter so post will get a breather did not score against Syracuse out with illness against Clemson 17 points most of those late in that game against the Irish Mike and North Carolina had made a switch they had put uh they had uh actually put Withers on post and theyre going to do that theyre going to put some smaller guys on him especially when hes out on the perimeter Mighty is also in there number two for the Eagles that is Zachary trying to C his way Davis was in the vicinity defending for Boston College it will be free throws fou against Carolina both for both teams its a smaller unit out there but so uh BC is more intent on attacking the basket 83 free throw shooter Jaden Applause Zachary game high 20 points in the win against Notre Dame was eight of 10 from the floor hes hit double digits 12 times this season Mike 38 points in his last two games prior to today and hes got a couple of free throws yeah its just a statistical odity that its another guy who had the no points circus and in his last two hes averag 19 points a game and they hung tough with the orange in that game which pulled off a dramatic victory at the Dome today against Miami on a last second threepoint shot try not to smile when you say that time back to the live action ball rolls out of bounds most of you before us saw Virginia Tech win on the road at NC State 478 the first game of CW Courtside Saturday and one thing with both of these teams but especially with Boston College two teams that take very good care of the basketball Withers is open out of the corner for three and hes knocking it down Mike and he had something to say to the crowd after the release its something he did a lot in Louisville but not not so much here in North Carolina you know he hasnt taken that many threes only 12 coming into this game Matson whistle again North Carolina and Withers Mike thats going to be number two on Applause him so

Boston College Eagles on the football side in the house tonight said hi to coach Halley wish the Eagles all the best against the tar Hills very few people not in the house here today complete sellout at KY Forum we have been doing games here for a very long time like I dont remember seeing this building as full as it is right now for this match up against North Carolina number four comes in and draws a crowd see see what Boston College zone defense looks like Mighty the hand off shot clock is deep need to recognize Madson hes going to have to let it go for three for MC Ryan tipped it and then it was saved by kadoo quickly head to Music Trimble offensive foul that was Washington on the screen and you know what and heres the look youll youll see and it just comes up and never really got set on the screen and um so mistiming on that play good call by the referee but see I mean with Zachary out of the game um you saw on that last play the shot clock running down thats on the point guard to keep it up and that really you know Kellys new into the game but hes got to have an awareness of where the shot clock is Chaz Kelly dble zero with the basketball right now for the Eagles quick release for three its an easy board for Trimble after the miss that from Donald H Applause Jr too bacock put it on the floor got it back on the reather intercepted Music hand runs it up tries to run it all the way to the rim couldnt get the angle on the layup attempt from Han had a great look at it too Trimble slices through contact is made mton was back there as the last line of defense heres the look nobody really stopped the basketball which is the key thing and the push up the floor so Trimble just kept on kept his dribble alive kept attacking the rim which is what you should do and thats actually for for BC mlon his second foul so see how ear Grant plays this out for the rest of the half with him tremble is 65 from the line on the season and now Zachary and post along with the league Bay and Harris Jr coming in for the Eagles so basically could be Mason Madson for mton two fouls on M Lockton to the bench for the Eagles Trimble one of Applause Music two Boston College its last win Mike against the top five team you go back to December of 20 17 they beat number one Duke 8984 right here at Connie FL seven alltime wins in Eagles history against top five teams the league b needs to send it back out to Madson with four on the shot clock Ryan got a piece of it on the way up all over Madson did get the shot away and the box out from bacock up ahead Ryan easy layup well terrific both ends of the floor Ryan really played Matson well defensively course that late shot and uh lead for North Carolina and then broke out just beat everybody in a foot race for the layup on the other end in the midst of a nine2 run for the Tar Applause Heels they they you know North Carolina that once again the shot clock on the back of Boston College in the half court Harris misses they have not been getting good looks in these last few sets this is Ryan checks the threepoint line post Zachary three on two to the wing and Harris control Applause dribble there the thing for BC not a lot of offensive rebounding presence up and down the court we go and now Zachary will just saunter up the floor is I BC when you know they dont want to play quite the same Pace that North Carolina does miscommunication they kept control approaching four minutes without a bucket League Bay shot Off the Mark so the struggles continue for the Eagles and then a Miss at the other end from Trimble long rebound and Harris and padoo reaching in Boston College Mike has missed its last seven shot attempts a lot of punches being thrown and nothing landed in the last 3 minutes or so coach Grant is at the College of Charleston prior to coming to Chestnut Hill the one thing this afternoon Tom thats going to be a big key for Boston College is keeping North Carolina or minimizing their free throws I looked at the the numbers and thats were a a big Advantage should be for North Carolina they do a lot of scoring at the free throw Music line Boston College is three for three from the line so far Mike three of six for North Carolina from the strike leag Bay hes behind the line yeah thats not they North Carolina wants him to take that shot two of 21 in the year coming in fumbled out of bounds and back to the Eagles so well take a time out North Carolina has taken the lead by just a point against the Eagles shes a thief and a corn artist her particular skill set can be helpful to

weather Spectrum in this exactly Duke is hosting pit also tonight Turn Around from Applause Music Applause post that early foul Earl Grant was very protective of Quinton post kept him on the bench extended minutes in the first half his jumper gives the Eagles the one point lead Ryan trying to get a round post couldnt do Applause it shot clock at 10 for kadoo acott still on the bench for North Carolina Ryan threepointer he say shooting has been a little up and down so far this year oh a four from three in the game to start with poost through the paint rims out knocked back on that jump hook or in that hook shot hes I both of them going away from the rim North Carolina one of the better threepoint shooting teams in the conference thats just inside the line for Ryan better look for him maybe thats the one that gets him into a little bit of Rhythm so Ryan now two of six from the floor and four points interesting as a newcomer to the program coach Davis told us he is the most vocal leader among this group a league Bay again for three weak side Harris trying to save it couldnt do it Ingram Carolina on the Run Ingram with the floater got his own Miss Davis Runner slash floater and he hits it I love that move you know that little floater in the lane I mean its a Steph Curry move that you know he is really perfected for a shorter player takes the block shot out of it or also takes any kind of charge out of play as well Boston College at 32 shooting in this first half and the shot clock is down to 10 5 and A2 minutes to go in our first half Tom wormy Mike jinsky are outstanding crew with you shot clock is down to two a league Bay hes got it a much better decision thats not not the guy you want the ball in his hands at the end of the clock but at least he got a better shot good go hustles up the court and scores instance where hes been aggressive end to the end to end five points for him thats two of three shooting for kadoo that corner Matson aggressively to the rim and he was Matt Ingram had him in midair mind you Davidson transition Kau eyes for the rim again not timid whatsoever Mike well I think trying to really put some pressure on Zachary to defend and he gets the foul on him but here how about this look folks not bad Ill meet you at The Rim hanging out behind the backboard what an angle on that replay appreciate your hard work Tom putting that camera up there pregame hours before the game tip of the hat to our crew spending long hours here in Conti for bring you the action on the CW and it wasnt exactly warm here folks in at the crack of dawn getting up and getting us ready to be on the air 2115 temperatures in the teens nice and cozy inside Connie Forum they might have been below the teens here home of Boston College athletics since 1988 we got close to 9000 people in the house for the game today Hubert Davis with the sport code and tribute to the lineage of Hall of Fame coaches on that North Carolina sideline see the Run Boston College trying to get on the board trailing by four as post put it on the floor thatll be Bott thatll be his second and that was what you know Hubert Davis was trying to hide him and trying to save him as well and that was a quick foul on Bott so they have really minimized him no points for Bott in the first half only three rebounds I mean hes a guy who averages close to 15 points per game you know and that was really a change of attitude for post early on he looked at a couple of Threes but since that time hes been very aggressive going into the paint and its its paid off for them getting Bott out of the game I mean what can you say about post Mike and his shooting abilities 50 from the floor ninth in the conference from the free throw line hes BCs best free throw shooter 83 ninth in the ACC and from yeah from 344 uh thats hes Elite level when you put those all together for a guy 7 ft I think theres a spot for him next level closes the Gap to two entry pass knocked away post doing it all thats so you want to deny that entry pass top down like that play on top Zachary back to post Washington was guarding post heres Ingram racing up the court Zachary able to deflect it away heels keep it for the moment Washington he was right near that end line and so the ball back to the Eagles coach Davis in the heels with a twopoint lead C W Courtside Music Saturday

17th time this season Mike North Carolina looking for that three ball from Withers well it really has been the bench thats had to give them a big lift and uh actually uh RJ Davis has got all five of those points in the big news from North Carolina two both two starters have not scored uh in uh Bott has yet to score in this game and Ingram hasnt scored in the game either in fact Bott has not attempted a shot in the game Mike yeah and the double team on him has worked well theyve gotten the ball out of his hands and and also that double team hasnt hurt BC either the you know the shots as a result have not hurt and North Carolina has won four in a row in the series seven in a row here in Chestnut Hill and all that being said they still have a twopoint lead BCs last win at home against North Carolina February 1st of 2020 and W up by points 7170 was at North Carolina here they have it one since 2010 knocked around and taken by kadoo Music Davis contested shot he hit the deck boy just a bad foul that time it was going to be a tough attempt anyway and thats a you know thats a thats why it a Music Applause second so Zachary picks up the foul Davis at the free throw line told hes 96 best in the ACC coming up on the Subaru halftime report well get a recap from Raleigh well go around the ACC have the highlights and stats from the first 20 minutes of this meeting between North Carolina and Boston College the 29th alltime meeting and one more free throw for Davis and Earl Grant is a guy who will play as guys with two fouls in the first half and especially a guy like Zachary hell trust him but that was not a good second fou and he just got to you know get a hand up contest that live with the results so Zachary and mlon with two personals for Boston College had a timeout taken prior to the inbounds out so DC has taken a 30second timeout well the thing you have to take away from that I mean this I dont you dont mind that timeout now but second half you better be prepared after a free throw line for a little pressure and have that you know you cant burn a timeout like that in the second half tomorrow Mike on CW womens Hoops the battle in blackburg as the

12th made three of the season for Zachary the second made of the game for Boston College two of eight from long distance this is Davis three estate hes got one as well well he seems his big Center over on the bench not playing he knows hes got to pick up the slack 11 points for him hes the first tar heeling double figures nobody takes more threes nobody makes more than RJ Davis with that threepointer his first of the game 53rd made on the season post Washington over zealous defending and the foul into the one andone situation but you know North Carolinas got some depth that size so theyve got some fouls to burn there even you know with Bott sitting over there on the bench Bott has two personal fouls Mike Jaylen Withers with two Washington to the bench with his three personal fouls and post to the free throw line again Bott has not scored in our Music game Clinton post has scored 11 points right now for post with one free throw up coming in his 106th career Collegiate game League Bay also with six points for the Eagles and a couple of free throws for post tell you what its thats a position center position that is really deep in the conference this year a good not a good Center play in the league angram lot of dribbling knocked over the defender offensive foul with Harris having the position anticipating the dribble there now theyve made that with the secondary Defender theyve made that a tougher call but uh on ball uh thats that was just good solid defense Boston College has only turned it over three times here in this first half they had three turnovers in the entire game on Monday a season low against the Applause Irish was Kelly on the drive and there was contact First on Zaden high for North Music Carolina two shots for Kelly 10 of 16 on the season from the line two freshman out on the floor right now for North Carolina and this and on on the page North Carolina one of the oldest teams in the Applause country 25yearold cormack Bryan Leading The Way of experienced players at Carolina lineup Davis is one of them as well Kau is a freshman trying to work off a little screen and there was too much contact thats the second time theyve had that foul called where the screener hasnt been set yet and its it really is its its more on the guy using the screen you got to wait for that guy to get set 32 is okano and uh you know Kau just maybe in a little bit too much of a hurry to get into the Applause Music lane this is Kelly into the lane turns and fires Jaz Kelly tied up at 30 Mike I think this this pace right now is one and this scoring pace is one that suits be see very Applause well Kellys going to pick up the foul against the driving Music Koo two guys have really have to be careful for BC in this last minute Zachary and post pick up that third and second foul here Kau with the chumper fight for the loose ball won by Prince aligue Bay and then he got toppled Zaden high for North Carolina its a couple of quick fouls against High maybe a couple of cheap uh some points that they can pick it uh pick up double Applause bonus League Bay to the free throw line at 66 for the season and they will for at least for the first half match North Carolina in in free throw attempts so that more for them a win in that category first attempts of the afternoon for a league Music bang sophomore on the line This graduate student senior on the bench bacock Rondo bacock Mike this is his 105th th career game a spectator without any points at this moment with 106 on the clock and 102 for a league Bay well things will kind of get back to normal after next year with the co year coming out and uh I think things will start to settle out Define normal yeah in Collegiate Athletics team in back door cut that was Davis racing on the Baseline hi trying to get to the rim cut off by a league Bay North Carolina keeps it it with Ingram shot clock inside of 10 Ingram turns and shoots Penning makes it and that was that was pretty good defense by Zachary but a better offensive play and those were his first points of the half and to give North Carolina the onepoint Applause lead about an 8sec Difference game and shot Kell with the shot clock at Applause 10 down to three offensive Applause Bou and thats Kelly Mike his Music second push off against High Applause second on Kelly count for him proud not in agreement with the officials at the moment Theo cross it over up top and the alley Slam at the end of the clock in the first half right at the end of the half usest thing in the world either you know to come out and get a really good usually youre youre trying to get some rest coming out of halftime but uh he needed to come out and get a great warmup get some rhythm going again North Carolina this season 10 and one with the halftime lead into the corner Zachary tracks it down thats what you want to do with Ryan you want to make drive him off the threepoint line make him take some sort of midrange Applause shot now Ryan now two of seven from the floor for North Carol Carolina thats those those numbers those statistics are wins for BC shot clock is at six for a league Bay has a size advantage over Davis tipped up by post batted around and Bott shovels It Forward Davis after the drop off by kadoo thats just you know kadoo looks so confident for a freshman out there saw him trailing on the break great little drop off pass Zachary shot bounces out on the drive this is one hes got to finish Davis again lets it fly into the corner trying to save it he did Bott spinning into post trying to get around him score it and hes going to the line and the foul is on post well that was interesting its the second shot in post is saying I I kept myself vertical but uh Paul going the other way and this is just a good aggressive move what you want to do if youre bot try to get in might have gotten away with the hook with this elbow Bott is into the box score 80 from the free throw line and the threepoint play a great way for him to get started in the first minute 15 seconds or so get some Rhythm out on the floor active leader in scoring in the ACC 2064 points now as he gets his first points of the afternoon they go inside mlon he got tied up Ryan and Davis in the Music vicinity first on Davis locked in at the free throw line Mike yeah and uh he mclin got off to a quick start in the first half but another

Away fouled on the shots Bott was defending hes going to get it Mike thats number three and that was on a fadeaway shot too I I I dont know that they would you know I didnt think they were going to blow the whistle on that one I I thought that post kind of bailed him out by taking that shot but he gets the call Hubert Davis is the wheels are grinding right now about whether he looks like he hasnt made a he hasnt made a a move to the bench still waiting Clinton post the only player in the country Mike averaging at least 169 points 74 boards 32 assists over two blocks and the thing too about BC theyre leading three leading scores or three leading assist guys too so really great balance open man Ingram bounces out hesitated for a moment bot got it back see when you when that double team works and the shot misses You got to get the defensive rebound Ryan the entry bacock post standing is ground Davis somehow got to the basketball and he came up short HEC lucky two three three shots on that possession a league b from Zachary from Boston College and Caroline and then then BC made him pay getting out and breaking getting the layup nine points for Prince El League Bay above a season average of 62 kdo from the paint bounces off post to mlon fighting for that ball for the Eagles as Zachary brings it up down by Applause four post lining up a three might have brought the house down with that one Mike you know its not many centers who have a guard Switched Off off on him and settle for a three he had Davis on him and just just launched the three one for three on threepoint tries for post battling low with bot shot clock is inside of 10 kdo well he has really been aggressive looking for his offense Zachary steaming to the rim had it knocked away Ryan Kad trying to track it down hes got Ingram puts it up there for Ingram who slams it home Music home what a sequence end to end Applause action well you know Kido hes made a couple just a very few questionable decisions but uh what a great break that time Harris turns and shoots mclock in high for the board kept it alive a league Bay from the free throw Applause line those was couple that was a big possession because you get the sense in North Carolina was on the verge of maybe starting to stretch some things out a little bit Ingram couldnt finish the play yeah post lucky he didnt get a foul called on that play they are Tangled Up behind the play Ingram and post its going to be a foul on Ingram Ingrams the one on the court and hes going to pick up the foul for North Carolina a fourpoint game the heels and

look at the last sequence it was Harris on the shop but you see it midcourt thats Poston white and Ingram Carolina blue well and that actually started well before all that it it started down at the other end underneath the basket those two got tangled up and they were it never really got untangled until that moment at half court so Bill Covington Jr and Jamal Spearman are at the scorers table they are joining by Jerry heer as our officiating Music crew still deliberating F was aess the Ingram if that stands itll be his Music second 1519 to go in our second half a threepoint halftime lead for North Carolina well and the big big the biggest storyline for North Carolina is Armando bot with three personal Applause fouls and just three points so far as well Mike those three coming in the second Music half conversation continues on the cony Forum Music floor thats Billington Jr with Coach Music Davis so the foul on Ingram will stand nothing further Jerry heers going to come over and talk to Mike real Applause Music quick its just going to its going to remain a common file I think they they were just looking to see if it was going to to upgrade it um thats the only thing they can do to to upgrade it to a a flagrant and uh so itll remain common his second foul whistle stops Play We got some moisture on the floor and official Jamal Spearman wants to get that mopped up so things have slowed down considerably for the moment with 1507 to go you know Tom you know through all of this BC has never been able to establish a lead of any kind theyve been lingering theyve been in the game but you know psychologically for the fan base here theyve never been able to establish any kind of you know three or four point cushion for themselves and they Trail by as many as nine in this game all in the first half and getting a little chippy we got players flying through the paint in cormack Ryan and Harris got tangled up but at that first whistle is going to is going to be on cormack Ryan you going see right here the whistle was before all that and honestly Mike Harris inadvertently stepped on Ryans foot and thats what made him stumble going back so and now I wouldnt be so the least little contact youre going to hear whistles because the referees are going to try to regain some control you know control of this game and uh more importantly four fouls and uh first five and half minutes for North Carolina so not too far away from getting into the bonus and see that theyre going to the whistle is going to be pretty tight here for a while and thats on post thats his Applause third and that one while what post was trying to do was trying to he he hit Bott tried to keep him from establishing low post position and Earl Grants going to get post out of the game here and maybe try to buy him some time to the Under 12 media timeout so Armani Mighty comes in for Clinton post a sophomore from Toronto Ontario Canada Mighty goes six 610 240 matching up with Bott I would look for him to be pretty physical with Bott as well Davis Around the edge trying to get it back to Bott inside it againsts mton over the top fight for the Applause ball Mighty picks up the foul in The Fray there it is and you know it has been a little bit of a struggle but this North Carolina team one of the best offensive rebounding teams in the country they get almost 40 of their missed shots yeah that was Withers who came over the top looking for the rebound for North Carolina and the foul against Mighty Ryan hits that shot and he and Harris yeah they got a little thing going yeah theyre having a conversation on the way back up the Music court and uh it was that just a beautiful curl and quick release by Ryan so the lead now six again its been as big as nine Zachary trying to cut into it cannot do it for BC I dont know if thats a shot you want to settle for when things things arent running very smoothly right now for BC theyre just two of 11 on threepointers as that one comes up short Ryan sticks in there and misses close range then he ties up mlon Ryan the easiest shot hes had all day misses it and then compounds it with a foul heres the look I mean hes hes just this is a gift two points right here misses it and then out of frustration gets the foul and and of all the guys on the floor the referees are locked in on him second on Cor M Ryan quite a journey for that young man stops at Notre Dame for three seasons started at Stanford now in Carolina blue 133 career games for cor Bryan the graduate student from New York City you talked about you know you talk about him as a leader hes a threetime captain at Notre Dame so he comes by those quality Applause honestly this the pace of this game may slow we may be into a free throw shooting contest in the last eight minutes of this game grinding to a slow crawl all of a sudden in the first half constant Sprints up and down the court the match up we were all looking forward to is not out on the floor with bot and post both on bench shock lock down a two Kelly he got it floating through the lane Jaz Kelly well 63 with long arms and a guy you like having the ball in his hands he can finish in the lane DC hanging around Ryan on the handle Davis intricate dribble and hand off Withers and hes going on a rim Bender for Carolina not an easy find by Davis either in a crowd knew he had a cutter coming in the Baseline North Carolina with a surplus of talent up and down that bench that got knocked away in a fou up coming theres the look there are a lot of bodies here and boy that was a nice wrap around we were talking earlier and they were just saying how even the Carolina guys were work just theyre like so impressed with weathers athleticism yeah hes coming off his first double double of the season in that home game against Louisville for North Carolina that was on Wednesday an 8670 Victory Madson at the free roll on you know its interesting when you when you when a fan base when they see a guy come through the portal they think all right were getting a junior were getting a you know whatever older guy its going to be seamless and its not its a new environment its a new team more importantly its new its new verbiage for you know on calls and things everything is new and it takes a while first points of the game for Matson who is now 18 of 18 from the free throw line on the season two big ones for the Eagles fourpoint game out of bounds theyre going to say it is off of Boston College and Madson animated as is his coach well and at this moment you have to be very it was it should be BC and and the crowd just saw the replay and it was it was BCs ball got to be inside of 2 minutes regulation in ot to look at that now granted it was a very close play on the Applause Baseline heres the look youre going to see it goes through his hands and you know and Matson he he waves at it but doesnt touch it should have been off at Jaylen Washington now certainly Mike we have the benefit of Replay looks like Chaz Kelly just picked one up getting loud inside Connie for him you know and this was this is what programs in North Carolina are used to you come in is the highly ranked Applause team Ryan got fouled North Carolina number four in the nation at 14 and3 and 60 in the ACC and Matson is not a happy camper looks like bot going over to the North Carolina bench as well but in and you know what Tom like right now as a player on either team you cant get consumed by the whistle you just cant its going to be tight and you cant you cant get upset with calls you just got to play through everything 90 from the line this season for M Ryan coming off a 14point performance on Wednesday where he made four threepointers in the win against Louisville lead is Applause six Applause Kelly Ryan soaring for that rebound again 26 for him I think a guy who can with with his length better much better off getting into the lane knocked around to mton Madson is open launches a three two on one no board coverage taking a three like that BC threepoint struggles continue Withers against mlon they get bumped and hit the deck time out on the court catch your breath 11113 to go in regulation 4842

CW Courtside Saturday continuing with game two Virginia Tech defeating NC Stadium Raleigh to get us started this is North Carolina and Boston College Tar Heels strong in the first half Mike struggles in the second half BC just a little worse well and post back on the floor for Music BC and Im trying to look and see Armando Bott still not on the floor for North Carolina three points on one of three shooting and its all in the second half for Bott Withers is at the free throw line first time the this afternoon for Withers you know at least in the short term right now I think that Boston College needs to give the threepoint shot AR rest I mean theyre two of 13 for the game you know they need to start building their offense inside out for the season Mike theyre not a bad threepoint shooting team fourth in the conference 36 and Im not Im not saying give up on it but you know its not its not falling for you right now so go to go to other things and and build from the inside out so the lead is now eight after the free throws by Withers about to cross the 11minute threshold of our second half a leag b Harris down the lane Harris it bounced out hell go to the free throw line and see for him they need him desperately in the last 11 minutes he uh he not scored in the game and this is a perfect way to find some sort of rhythm uh not the greatest shoot free throw shooter in the world at 67 but at least the you know the way to see the chance to see the ball go through the basket yeah 15 points per game and finally into the box score for Harris transfer from Charleston Southern spent two years there and was second in the conference in scoring the Big South the season ago back to a sixpoint Applause game Ryan take the pass hit the shot thats a little step back and uh you know they they didnt get the roll guy but the DCs defense caught in between post leads the way with 13 a league Bay has 11 for Boston College this is post on the Move inside Quint Post Yeah much better they started with five out on that play but eventually work post Applause inside 17 times his season hes gotten double digits for post leading BC in scoring they caught over with the scores table waiting to get back in Withers on a league Bay just a little too much on it post had it for a moment tar Hills able to save it on the Baseline its got to be Five Guys on the glass for Boston College diving play by aono eight on the shot clock entry cono off the glass Ryan com flying in post has the Applause rebound Kelly with the hesitation in drive and Kau was guarding him to pick up the foul okay thats going to be the ninth team foul for North Carolina so BC won away from a double Applause Music bonus so Harris came in for Boston College Bott is back in along with Ingram Davis as well its interesting with this yeah well it might be only a fourpoint lead thought that Hubert Davis might try to get under the 8 Minute Mark with Bott on the bench I mean Bott averages 15 points per game Applause Mike well I you know you can you can look at this a couple of ways Tom you can look at that line that he has and the fact that theyre on the road winning this Applause game they are three and0 away from Chapel Hill Boston College is 7 and two at home this is Applause Ingram and defending on Applause Ingram first on Applause hand and this has been a place where Harrison Ingram has struggled so far this this year only 56 from the line he gets Two Shots first free throws of the game for Ingram and I you know that with that form and that shot it looks better than 56 the Junior from Dallas Texas looks a lot better than 56 two big free throws by Ingram foul situation right now thats you know thats actually thats what uh what Earl Grant talked about was trying was defending without fouling in this game so hes done a good job of that and you know North Carolina has had theyve got bigger bodies that can they can waste some fouls Davis misses post has the rebound able to hang on to it VC Mike still two of 14 on threepointers in the game they hanging with the number four team in the nation trailing by six nice pass oh and he went for the Home Run dunk and just go for it to finish the play and that Bott recovered defensively against the league Applause Bay Harris was going for the Highlight re Jam yes he was and lost control of the ball Ingram with the ball right now up to 900 career points for Ingram trying to put the moves in the Paint Drop It Low cannot collaborate with Bott and hes a good passer he can make a play but he would have been better off getting the ball up on the rim that time cuz Bott was right in front for offensive rebounding position with nobody to block him out Bott has seven boards in the game Ingram has nine for the leading rebounding team in the conference post inside against Bott he smothered the shot Kau tried to get it to Bott tipped away bounce pass would have been better too many hands up in that area for a direct Applause pass Harris lets a fly still has not made a shot from the field 0 of four now from behind the ark 0 of six on the game just two points for Harris as Mike mentioned the average is 15 per game and Pau was wide open for the layup and this is youre uh youre starting to leak into the Red Zone here now if youre uh if youre this is this a critical offensive possession lot of dribbling from Kelly post knocked Away by Bott shot clock is at 10 foul on the shot by Harris and he braises his hands to the heavens as Applause finally lell Harris Jr shakes the defender foul and basket hes on the line when

more than 150 years in the struggles of the big man bot Mike yeah three points well below his scoring average only taking three shots in the game Tom one of three but doing it on the glass Quinton post 15 points having a fine game but he also has three personal fouls the post eight rebounds but Bott also eight rebounds so hes doing other things out on the floor Harrison Ingram 10 rebounds so in North Carolina a big advantage on the glass but that was a this that was a massive jump shot on a number of different levels for claudell Harris Jr he will be at the free throw line trying to complete the threepoint play Boston College just two of 15 on threepointers and yet Mike this could be a fivepoint game after this free throw well and very so BC going out gets two free throws with every fou there and theyre shooting in the double bonus and and uh BC in their own right has 18 fouls and both very good free throw shooting team so nobody has the advantage there BC is 19 of 22 in the game North Carolina 14 of 16 and that one thats actually a stat line that I thought North Carolina had a huge Advantage BCs been able to hang in on missed by bacock volleyball out by Ingram a great play by Ingram couldnt get it but kept it alive for a teammate got it from Ryan shot clock inside of 10 Ingram against mlon Harrison Ingram for North Carolina add to the free throw line mls Applause fourth our fifth Im sorry hes gone so great take right Music there thats a uh thats thats thats a big loss for uh for Boston Music College so Ingram at the line hes two for two in the game from the Applause stripe sevenpoint game inside of 6 and a half minutes to go in regulation from Connie Forum Tom wormy Mike jinsky are outstanding CW ACC basketball production crew CW Courtside Saturday Zachary hes another one whos well below his scoring average in the game shot clock winding down a league Bay another three attempt this time he knocks it down well you know Earl Grant must just hold his breath every time he races up for a three certainly the percentages arent with him but he knocks out a timely one there just his third made three of the entire season as bakon got stumbled for a moment so did Ryan maintaining the dribble against Matson flips it into bot went up for the jam post challenged him at The Rim foul foul is called on post a midair meeting poost and Bott its his fourth and in this one I cant figure out because Quinton post lost where Bott was he was focused in on cormack Ryan and the dribble on the other side of the Applause lane Bott is an 80 free throw shooter made his only free throw attempt so far in the Applause game I dont know if you take uh you take post out of the game here a little bit switch him off of Bott but uh not a lot of options for ear Grant only guy you can bring in maybe Elijahs strong hes under siiz but very physical or Armani Mighty just for defensive purposes go offense Applause defense the best thing he do is to pick up the fourth foul on Bon Harris post offensive glass up and in from Boston College rolled in after that pick and roll got great offensive position now he was on the same side as the shot being taken and doesnt normally come there but went right to him 17 points at nine board Sinton post Davis trying to shake a couple Defenders got it back shot like a 10 as he lets it go 6056 North Applause Carolina Harris against Bott see he hes got Bott switched on him why bail him out with that shot drive him Davis Bott free throw line jumper nice play just a second field goal of the game for Bott Mike with seven points yeah and post is not going to get anywhere near him to offer any kind of resistance Kau third on kadoo double bonus for both teams Zachary to the strike so mighty is at the scores table as well for Coach Grant yeah I think especially under like the twominute Mark I think youre going to see a lot of offense for defense with those two guys with post and Applause Music mighty so post will have a seat he is just a rebound away from a double double he got five this season Zachary now four for four from the free throw line of the game for Boston College once again its a fourpoint game both teams with three Applause timeouts Ingram Oh a for Ingram right in front of his own bench well that is a number thats been improved uh since his Stanford days 41 hes a 10 percentage points better in his two years there five of 17 is a team on threes and Matson drives and scores great take and I said you know botts going to be a little reluctant although he can be more aggressive now were were just about at the 3 minute Mark so you can start to forget a little bit about your foul issues Davis drops a load of big cot going for the champ and he got fouled to League Bay went up with him and got a piece of Applause bacot well if this point in the game if youre going to foul you got to make sure its only for two free throws and not a threepoint play Armando Bott inside the jam and the foul got a nice roll when youre great your game does the talk in the ACC our speaks B three of the last eight NCAA championships 99 NCAA tournament wins since 2015 eight NCAA titles in the last 22 years six of the

Armando botts nine points coming in the second half also has eight rebounds RJ Davis with 14 points leads the way for North Carolina Quinton post has 17 hes the leading scorer for Boston College so Bott has a chance to cap off a threepoint play Line North Carolina doing a better job taking care of the basketball in the second half and uh DC doing a better job on their defensive glass but we see Quinton post back on the floor for the offense Post in with four personal fouls an eightpoint North Carolina lead critical for BC to have him on the floor to finish the game Matson driving against Ryan basket and foul for Madson and see thats thats why right now the oldfashioned threepoint play is the way to go because the referees are just prying to blow their whistles and you you stop the clock you score you accomplish a lot of things that way still has not missed a free throw this season Boston College in the game now 22 of 25 from the line keeping him in this one BC has just got to be an attack mode offensively dont settle for the threepoint Applause shot 14 points and four assists for RJ Davis leading scorer in the ACC they on the handle now for Carolina shot clock down to four for Ryan around Zachary cut him off for the moment Ryan got the shot away right at the end of the clock and a foul called and they and they theyre going to he got it he got it off and what an untimely foul officials are going to take a look at it mik Bill C J and Jamal Spearman at the scores table right Zachary just had him completely locked up and there it is on the elbow and this is the Music question Music yeah thats about three on the clock when he got it away yeah that was as good a defense as you can play and then as bad a decision as a bad a foul as you want to get in the last3 seconds so it was Zachary defending for Boston College weve got 2 and A2 minutes to go in regulation 6 863 North Carolina trying to improve on a seven game winning streak and stay undefeated in conference play number three j z thats his third personal foul at the line shooting two shots the tar Zachary has his third personal foul Hubert Davis Earl Grant crunch time and and I know its hard Tom but I think you know as a player that instinctively you got to say this is going to be a really tough shot for him to make and to not bail him out on thats in that situation regardless I know its its so hard to do but if he makes it he makes it but and then you you got to you know you got to have that scouting report in your head and say this guys a 90 free throw shooter The Experience up and down that roster for North Carolina led by the 25yearold M Ryan wearing his third different uniform at the Collegiate level they the free throw they are the fifth most experienced team in the nation and you just wonder how far that could take them this season business at hand is against Boston College and a seveno lead Zachary got tied up took it right to RJ Davis second on Davis Zachary to the

our way down to the final two minutes on the year 100 more makes in their opponents what a drive by Davis you cant let him get to his right Applause hand definitely some confusion defensively for the

by six early in the first half most of the way its been North Carolina in front but you know for North Caroline again theyre used to being in this type of environment you know there there was a lot of

talked about it I mean 100 theyre plus 15 the attempts on the season from the free throw line plus 100 makes so you know this game a little bit of an anomaly from that standpoint Ryan is now five for five from the free throw Music line quite an effort by The Eagles but there is a reason that North Carolina is number four in the nation sellout crowd today and this weve seen a parade of teams at number one this year and this is a team that hasnt been number one that very well could be a number one at some point in time the preseason number one status from a year ago is a distant memory from

double
