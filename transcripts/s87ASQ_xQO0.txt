on for the tip its the tallest player in Syracuse history nahem McLoud and 7 foot Harlen obioha purple Eagles win the tip were ready to go thank you so much for joining us on your Thursday evening New York State rivalry right here not exactly a rivalry with Niagara struggling this season theres Luke bumbalo mod Henderson the leading score Syracuse faithful on its feet waiting for that first bucket Henderson the jumper off the back for him McLoud on the rebound moud did a nice job against Oregon last time he crashed the boards well you know mlau is a guy that we just need him to be a presence out there we ar looking for him to get 20 and 10 if you can be a presence run the floor be big out there alter shots hes going to make an impact when hes out there Starling misses from deep and Tucker on the rebound long pass for Niagara couldnt go they turn it over its going right back to the C you know I was talking to Greg uh coach Greg paulus before the game and hes looking to limit Syracuses transition points and make him play in the half court but you have to take care of the ball if you want to be able to do that it definitely seems like thats where Syracuse is at its best when it can run fast and play all the great Syracuse teams have played uptempo they played with good Pace uh and this Syracuse team is another one that loves to play Up Tempo and they excel at it men down low the spin the shot and the score Syracuse on the board for two its by way of its leading scorer Jud minz you know even when he he gets stopped hes so crafty with his footwork hes one of the best guards around the rim one of the best finishers in the country you played with some great guards in your day and you know you werent too bad for yourself but wheres Judah minz ranking in terms of college guys that youve seen you know what hes up there with some of the best of them and I played with one of the best guards of all time at Syracuse and Johnny Flynn and he has that Johnny Flynn type flare uh Im not going to compare him to John but you know having shot 101 free throws in only 11 games this season I mean its hard to keep guys in front of him and and he usually gets to the basket at will there he is down low covered by Luke bumbalo Bell up top midrange Jay is cash now heres a guy 67 lanky if he brings energy and effort on the defensive end I think hes a whole different player hes a guy whos a sharpshooter and you know what if he brings all that pack that he has hes hes the NBA Prospect for such a young guy it seems like his shooting form is just so smooth already yeah he hes one of the best Shooters uh you know to come through he just has to stay out of his head be confident and continue to play heres zad Henderson the had had 23 last time out against bton on the J its short Mintz on the rebound averages about three of those a game heres Starling over to Taylor turned over there goes Randy Tucker looking for an option oang menza blocked away out of bounds and its staying with Niagara you see that last turn of where Syracuse had its just about you know creating space and and be able to move without the ball Yao oang menza fouled on that attempt went up with it rather foul on the play Bumbo inbounds to harlon obioha sevenfooter turns it over Justin Taylor down the lane knocked away nice crafty play to stop the transition yeah Justin Taylor just has to go in there strong he has going up against against a guy 5 seven just go ahead and use your strength and Bully him to the rim inst on the lane the shot no good playing with the long sleeves today and he fouls Henderson and and thats what we talk about with Judy he could be an outstanding Defender but silly fouls like that you know obviously hes frustrated about you know the shot he just had but just get back on defense keep him in front of you because he is capable of being you know one of the best defenders in the country Syracuse team has played some very solid defense lately only L up 63 to Oregon 68 to Georgetown 70 to Cornell those are their three straight wins yoha dumps down low oang menza looking for a shot cant get it off dumps it down to obioha blocked by Taylor back outside to Henderson from Deep off the front rim nager cant capitalize Starling A J yes JJ Starling his first points of the day hes been shooting hot lately and his confidence continues to bro I mean hes a guy that we talked about earlier in the show he just hes capable you know McDonalds All American you know he just needs to get out of his head and just go play ball theres Haron obioha up top averages eight points and eight rebounds he turns it Music over nice jumper from JJ Starling 62 caruse onapa Niagara well be right Music back a School record in completion percentage is uh pretty impressive man hes a leader of young men I mean being a point guard and a quarterback and then obviously playing chesi playing for cheski at Duke uh you know Greg Pauls has came a long way and he will continue to progress in this game you two have known each other for a long time both 05 guys playing the McDonalds AllAmerican Game together you said you knew early on that he was going to have the career he does I did you know while he while I was out uh messing around and he was in the room studying The Playbook and I knew right there and then that he was going to be a heck of a coach and uh you know Greg has done a unbelievable job so far in his fifth year in niag his squads hanging tight with Syracuse right now 65 after the Luke bumbalo three heres Judah minz pulling up from midrange gets the n one on the jumper you know what one of one of the best at getting into the midrange area he has one of the best pullups in the country you know I know the NBA Scouts want to see a little bit more consistency at the threepoint line but you know hes a heck of a player getting downhill hes a heck of a player in that midrange and boy I tell you what he is tough to stay in front of hes developed his shooting stroke and certainly been to the line plenty of times this season 101 free throw attempts this year at second most in the country only to produ Zack Edy who 75 yeah not bad company not bad you know its pretty unbelievable after 11 games that youre getting to the free throw line you know over a 100 times people arent doing that in the season maybe two seasons so its its a pretty impressive stat hes hitting those shots too 78 on the season helped him get to 20 points a game Luke bumbalo closely covered by Starling looking for an outlet hes got Dre Bullock Louisiana Tech transfer looking for space down low kicks it out rexton bis PES off bumbalo from downtown yes you know what and and thats a tough shot right there but a great defensive possession until the last four or five seconds you got to finish the defensive possessions if youre Syracuse thats two threes for Luke bumbalo hes got all eight points for the purple Eagles heres Judah minz has five points so far fakes a kick out takes it himself go rebound by Yao oang menza bis back to oang men no good cloud with the rebound you see the athletic ability there of Chris Bell hes a guy if hes engaged and locked in he hes had a game this year where he had four blocks I think he can really be a really good defensive player out of the perimeter and also in transition Niagara back in transition they add two more thats Trey bolock on the board for the first time today purple eagles with the lead Syracuse Trails by one about 6 and 12 minutes in probably not how coach ay pictured this one going to start when youve got a Greg paulus Le team theyre not going to back down to anybody niagar is going to come in here theyre excited to play in the dome you know the last game before break theyre ready to come in here and get an upset we we said it was a trap game for Syracuse they got to be ready to play theres bis down the lane caugh by the and theres that presence that we talked about earlier in the game vce twohanded Slam Syracuse back in transition where they they belong defense to offense thats theyve been doing a great job of that lately getting deflections getting blocks getting Steals and getting out in the open court playing fast judan seven points so far leads the way Braxton bis getting crafty dishes down low out of bounds Syracuse ball now thats one thing right there heres defense into offense for you dvo exactly how Su wants to do it yeah and and and on that last possession speaking of McLoud he does a great job protecting the rim but sometimes he catches himself getting too far away from the basket and thats where you see guys slip behind him if thats going to happen you got to have those fours drop in and help McLoud but he does his damage when he can stay around the rim and protect the rim wholesale substitutions for the orange Kyle cuff quer Copeland Benny Williams m brown all checking in theres Copeland down low gets foul but here Copeland set it to the line hes had a nice pair of games lately too hes hes really starting to fit in on this team you know what hes a Swiss army knife on this team hes a guy whos super versatile hes 67 he brings the ball up he can pass he can drive he can make plays at The Rim you know one thing about his game he probably needs to get a little bit more consistent with this jump shot but hes a guy who can come in and do a lot of things and you see over these last few games he has been making an impact when hes out on the floor it seems like hes a guy on this team that everyone really gravitates to hes kind of a natural leader and in the way he talks and he hes kind of a goofy guy too makes everybody laugh thats definitely the guy you you need on any team super high energy guy you even see it when hes on the bench hes clapping hes waving the towel and you need a guy like that on a team when stuffs not going good hes a guy who can come in and bring that energy level up where he needs to be and even when he wasnt playing a ton last year still kept that energy too absolutely and you need that especially with a young team you got to keep that energy High thats a big thing a big attribute to have is is big energy and effort bumbalo another three how about it Luke bumbalo 11 points hes a guy averaging 28 minutes averaging almost nine points but hes a shooter on The Scouting Report they had shooter circled you got to find them out on the perimeter Syracuse has to do a better job of locating them bumbalo shooting 33 from three on the season avering just over eight points per game its really become a threat for this Niagara team he had 16 points last time out 14 the game before hes leading the purple Eagles tonight 1312 Syracuse and Luke bumbalo is the reason why you know what Jack this guy is coming out competing at a high level hes playing off of dhs one two dribble pullup spotting up hes a guy that can really shoot the ball and hes competing at a high level Syracuse has to do a better job of locating them and getting up in them and forcing them to put the ball to the basket bumbalo a ball All State transfer hes a grad student at Niagara right now hes always been a shooter but hes been through his ups and downs his junior year at Ball State he shot 36 from three then last year only 28 had to refind his stroke and he certainly has tonight 11 points hes hit three threes no Jack these guys are going to come in here and compete I dont care they dont care if you have Syracuse across New Jersey theyre excited to play theyre going to come up and compete at a high level Syracuse has to bring it the New York State foe these two have been playing since 1910 over 100 years back and forth I think they want some of those New York State bragging rights if they can get them too especially with their head coach being a Syracuse guy yeah you know what theyve done a great job of keeping Syracuse out of transition for the most part and making them play in the half court offense Ager tries to keep it in that was Dre bollock with the hustle couldnt keep it at Syracuse ball the orange have come out of the gates a little bit slow why do you think that is you know what like I said earlier theyre niagar is doing a good job of keeping them out of transition and thats where we really where Syracuse really excels at they have to get better movement in the half court and they got to be able to get downhill and create plays for themselves and get the balls open Shooters heres copelan kicks out to Williams for three yes Benny Williams puts up a Applause tray had a solid outing against Oregon eight points off of four of four maybe hes turned a corner its a great sign for seeing Benny Williams hitting his first jump shot hes a guy who can impact the game if hes engaged and locked in we all know hes one of the most athletic guys on the floor poked Away by Brown that one heads out of bounds and staying with Niagara boy mik Brown is always in the passing Lanes I tell you what he get it seems that he gets three or four of those every single game I if we looked up deflections in the country he has to be in the top 10 because he is a guy who has some of the quickest hands and and hes a guy whos definitely coming into his own we saw what hes capable of last year as a freshman slow start to the early in the season but hes really picked it up these last few games Brown over two steals a game second in the ACC Henderson Off the Mark Vince looking for an outlet hell take it slow Williams from downtown no that ones short bis on the rebound to Henderson oh that ones long cant keep him leaving him open hes going to knock down some of those shots you got to find him on the perimeter Copeland spin oh in the fet how about it a little bit of flare Spin and a little bit of loopy Lop to the hoop quader hes bringing it man he hes exciting to watch its a spin move and then to slow down and get the Finesse off the glass thats impressive good defense on the other end cuff pushing jumper oh in and out the toilet bow spin obioha with the rebound Henderson the point guard controlling from up top dises off to bis out down low Oola finishing through traffic the big fell 7 foot 280 lb making his contribution early on we talked about earlier how he lost about 6070 lbs used to be a what fivestar football player back in the day transformed his body and now hes starting center here at Niagara all through quite a journey put here copelan get blocked on the other end here comes marble goes up for the layup that ones no good harlon Obi OHA like you mentioned Eric was once almost 350 lbs an offensive lineman in Kansas had some great offers too some power five schools he came into Niagara two years ago halfway through the year and he was still a big fella he wasnt in shape to play basketball and they certainly got him right you know what it shows the dedication he has to the game of basketball and getting his body right getting his mind right shout out to you know the Niagara coaching staff and training staff for helping them you know lose those 67 pound thats thats not a small feat right there thats a thats pretty incredible to lose that amount of weight in in that uh you know amount of time so you know shout out to him for getting his body right and going from football to basketball thats a its a big transition there as well one that his head coach certainly made GRE paus yeah he and he did it well well obioha has been a strong contributor for Coach paus averaging about eight points eight rebounds a game hes the first sevenfooter for Niagara since sha shano 1988 to 92 it definitely means a lot for a small team like this to have a big man down low like that yeah absolutely you know theres not a lot of big guys you know basketball period its its more of a perimeter oriented game you know obviously see that in the NBA not as much in college but you know to see a a real sevenfooter you talk about Bott and Zach Edy and and guys like that but in the conferences like Niagara you dont see those guys a lot so he has the potential to come in there and uh you know really make a presence in in their conference hes certainly helped Niagara keep this one tied at 17 AP piece Malik Brown at the line he cashes the first one Mal Brown a contributor on both sides of the ball averaging about seven points and five rebounds a game kind of a Just A Silent Assassin dvo he stays quiet and goes to work brings his lunch P every single game and just goes to work I mean you need those type of guyss hes quiet he doesnt say much but you know what youre going to get out of him each and every night 1917 orange on top of the purple Eagles Starling with the full court pressure heres o bang menah poked Away by Williams trying to recover down the lane another tip away defense and offense William F cant finish the dunk oh my goodness he just took flight and Jack if youre going up to finish thats what youre going to try to finish like that he almost just put him on a poster Benny Williams that would have just been mean to Randy Tucker hes looking up at the video board he he wanted that one and we see a different Benny Williams dont we from the start of the Season these you know obviously Oregon having eight points four for four but even early on in this game you just see a different energy with him and its great to see because if hes playing with that energy you know he can he can be a big contributor for this Syracuse basketball team engaged on the defensive end too that last defensive possession started with him trying to poke the ball away absolutely and you see the guards cuff JJ up theyre playing hard theyre playing up thats what they need to do you you cant let guys get comfortable see the see the defense see over top of the defense and just let them you know do whatever they want to do you got got to get him get up in him make him be uncomfortable you know especially with Henderson you got to make this guy play theres been question marks about around Williams most of the Season he didnt play against kishis New Hampshire Gonzaga Cornell hes come to play today heres Henderson kicks out to Tucker from Deep no good Brown fights for the rebound Williams has it up to CU down the lane nice little Euro off the glassing in thats a tough finish you seen cuff last game come in and really was the spark against Oregon that really started that run you know going in late first half into the second half and and cuff is a guy whos capable shooter and also a guy who can get out and play in transition you saw there we talked about the bench points against Oregon that came big time from Williams and cough will Brown has a nice block both of them are in it today celand down the lane step through and a score the shrug of the shoulders CER knows hes got another bucket Syracuse pulling away really exciting ball so far yeah absolutely like I said coach Jack she has them on the right track going forward uh and I think theyre just going to continue to get better you know as they progress this year theyre back in Action here at home on New Years Eve against Notre Dame you catch that one on acc Network extra ACC Network rather theres bumbalo at the wing covered by cuff back to Henderson down the lane the floater off the glass no good you know what nager runs a lot of good stuff a lot of good movements getting guys where they can get opportunities to get to the bucket great take C through contact an angry finish Jack hes came in and we talked about the energy that he brings hes changed the game having himself a day so far hes got seven Music points hes just gotten real crafty and how he finishes huno you know what I said it to somebody the other day he kind of reminds me of like a Shawn Livingston type I I maybe aging myself but know 67 can bring the ball up super crafty a guy who put guys in their spots I mean hes having a heck of a you know last what three four games oh tough with a nice step and a shot off the glass two more points for him hes got four the bench is showing out four for cuff four for Benny Williams and seven for quer you know Syracuse you go back to the beheim days were only playing Seven guys jack and now Syracuse the depth that they have we talked about against Oregon you know having 44 bench points and now were talking about Copeland and cuff you know just picking up where they left off thats Emmy rudai C with the n one bucket now Eric you didnt really come off the court much did you when when they were playing six seven guys I tell you what no I would be mad if I did I need to be in that game coach hes certainly kept you in plenty heres zy rudai C at the line sophomore out of Anala South Australia played at Barton Community College been a contributor for this Niagara team this season Australia you know what I lived in Melbourne Australia for one of the best countries I have ever been to in my life so shout out Australia man my guy from South Adelaide Adelaide yeah oh great City what was it like there I mean it was beautiful uh you know I was in Melbourne so its its like top you know four places to live in the world they say shopping and you got downtown and then right down the street is beat so The Best of Both Worlds I guess not better than Syracuse and Detroit though not better than Syracuse they definitely not better than Detroit the lav almost a onehanded Slam by Bullock weve seen a couple of almost Sports Center top 10 dunks today but no dice rudai C gets slapped on the arm foul on Syracuse and you know what Jack this one thing Syracuse has to put those defensive possessions together you cant just have two good ones and then take three four plays off and then try to get back into it you got to find a rhythm defensively and you got to start putting those possessions together thats a fifth foul on the orange so far that one went on Justin Taylor his first theres Randy Tucker step back Jay he kicks it out instead over to Bumbo its wide left out of bounds into the stand Syracuse has to stay disciplined on those ball fakes niagar is doing a good job of you know using their ball fakes and getting Syracuse off their spots they got to stay Music disciplined Adrian ay Le Squad playing mostly mantoman defense this season its been a solid defensive unit allowing about 70 points a game theres Copeland another two for Q I tell you what if he can add that to his game you know midrange pull up and be consistent right there his game goes to a whole another level he has been playing at an unbelievable level you know over these last four games Syracuse has made five of its last six shots Copelands got nine points theres bumbalo hes got 11 kicks it out to Tucker for three Off the Mark great contest like K cough pushing the other way the spin and the legay oh no good ground on the put back helping your teammate out I tell you what cuff and Copeland have came in and changed the entire energy of this game and I was tough on cuff early in the season you know I thought he wasnt doing what hes capable of doing but these last two games you know Oregon and now Niagara he is really showing what he is capable of there goes bis covered closely by Brown bumbalo from Deep oh no way Luke bumbalo 14 points and four threes look like there you know what he got a little bit of dvo in him you know but you know what on the Scout report shooter you got to be on top of that guy even with a hand in his face hes going to knock it down just like he showed you right there sharp shooter for niagaras keeping the purple Eagles in this one Syracuse turnover by copelan here comes Niagara Tucker the Fate now low lays it up no good oh second attempt cant fall either purple Eagles come up with nothing on the other end know thats one thing that coach Paul said at prame you know if we can limit transition opportunities to make them play in the half court you know well be happy you dont see that too off for Malik Browntown Malik Brown first three of the season for Malik Brown on Q This Syracuse bench has been great today and the coaching staff told me of Syracuse they told me that hes capable of shooting the ball I guess we just havent seen a lot of it hes working on that jumper and its paid off today got his first three hes got seven points right now heres Dre Bullock three in the shot clock from Deep Bumbo no good Brown gets the rebound his fifth of the day the communication isnt there with bumbalo I mean he just hes hit you know what four threes he you got to Music communicate 3523 C on top Malik Brown from to continue that now you mentioned that in your days with Coach beheim you really only saw six seven guys play this team is deep and you know what that thats just the way college basketball is now you got so many guys who are versatile and athletic and you know with this team you could go nine 10 Deep and everybody who know gets the opportunity on the floor has the opportunity to make an impact theres bumbalo the other way gives off to bis in the corner lety rudai C crosscourt pass Niagara quick ball movement HCK to O bang menah he cashes the j cuts the deficit to 10 Rene hea checks into this game only his third game of the season big man filling in for Malik Brown that P that practice yesterday really noticed it Manor hea is a a vocal leader of the bigs hes a smart guy that really knows where everybody should be playing and you know what he he reminds me of a guy who Syracuse fans know by musaka hes the guy who you know wouldnt stuff the stat sheet but he was a leader on the floor he was the guy who was communicating he was getting everybody in their spots and hea is in that same type of mode is by m he does the little things right hits his free throw you need guys like that Jackie everybody has a role on the team and everybody has to play it and hes one of those guys who plays his role to a team shot clock winding down the three is Off the Mark Bell on the rebound Aima in his second season with the orange transferred from Caine last year there he is with the ball gives off to Starling from Deep no good mince fights for the rebound but its bollock and despite the Miss I I still want JJ to shoot that shot cuz it it it looks smooth steel from Mintz averages about two of those a game thats fourth in the ACC Bell from Deep Off the Music Mark Syracuse so far today two for nine from Deep you know we know Bell can shoot the ball but I think we can get that shot anytime especially with a guy closing out give him a pump fake and then get to the rim and show your athletic and theres hea protecting the rim and a nice job so so far mince to Starling Starling so far has two points only one for six though 0 for three from three had a good game against Oregon 14 points for that a stellar one against Georgetown as well at 21 at three of three from Deep theres Bell midrange is long you know I think JJ just passed up opportunity to shoot that shot you see J you see Judah telling him to shoot the shot he was coming off that you know up off the corner and he did have an opportunity to knock it down three minute long scoring drought for the CES heres bumo no shortage of points from him today he got 14 from way downt he buries it Luke bumbalo keeping niagar in this one I tell you what I dont know if C has learned their lesson yet get up on that man hes shooting the ball at an extremely high rate and you see his confidence is through the roof right now you know coach Greg bace is happy with how Niagara is playing right now hes got range and Adrien ay isnt happy about it he calls timeout they want to talk for Henderson so you know coach Paul has done a great job of running sets and getting guys in spots and giving them opportunities to get open looks Syracuse has been a different story the orange have missed six in a row havent scored in over three and a half minutes about 10 seconds to go in the first half going to go into the locker room with some momentum heres Mintz from Deep he gets fouled headed to the line for three bad foul right there oh whether its driving down the lane or pulling a three Jud knows some way to get to the line no matter what well again if if Im bis and I look at The Scouting Report you know what does Mintz really excel at getting to the rim getting downhill yeah he can hes capable threepoint shooter and hes definitely improved this year but hes not a guy that you want to go out and foul on the point shot now youre exactly right he has shot the three well this year about 41 but still 50 of his field goal attempts come from at The Rim hes done well on him shooting 60 at The Rim this season and and tell you what you know just being the professional scorer that I was I I think that you being able to get yourself to the free throw line you know knock a couple down when youre not hitting a couple jump shots now youre just starting to get a little bit comfort more comfortable seeing that ball go in the basket and thats when you get a little get more confidence you know the rest of the game bumbalo throwing up a prayer well finally he missed one huh you know what hes had a heck of a first half and I think Co half court they have to be able to execute move the ball and get open opportunities for each other only nine fast break points for Syracuse been mostly half court offense there goes mince The Hop through delay is nothing but net Good Start thats one way to do it right just get downhill and and get to the make a unbelievable finish I me weve seen him do that numerous times over his career here at Syracuse unbelievable finish heres Luke Bumbo leading score today with 17 points he gives off to Randy Tucker bum Belo five of seven from threepoint range today hes hit all five threes for Niagara heres the step back downt no good you know every time he puts it up yeah everybodys thinking its going in oh he hes just thats hes playing right now he hes playing with a you know super confidence and hes looking to score that basketball men no good from Deep there goes Henderson he gives it up men a onehanded slam and an n one to go with it we talked about that about with McLoud just just not being able to react and being aware you know of where his man is you know his head was turned and then you got a guy coming down the middle of the Court you know looking to finish and now he gets dunked on with1 its a nice pass from Ahmad Henderson to hasnt contributed in scoring yet 0 for six but on the board with an assist thats points number four for ya obang menza after the free throw number five rather you see Niagara with a little bit of three you know quarter qu pressure trying to slow that c down uh offense down a little bit another foul on mince to full court pressure we saw one of those earlier Jack we talked about it just get back and stay in front those fouls are theyre stupid fouls you dont need that especially from a guy like Judah we need you in the game we need you you know youre Syracuses best player just fall back and play play defense in the half court mince has two on him now Syracuse has two in the second half its obioha outside bumbalo hes kicking it out somewhere Henderson and obioha miscommunication and Greg paus made the catch you know right there you could see on the throwback from bumbalo you know the big fella just got caught out there he probably should have just Dove to the rim theres Justin Taylor scr so far today Jay is off the marking menel with the board and Jack hes a guy that we need to see be more assertive you know hes a guy who he looks like hes playing tentative hes in his head a little bit go out there and be aggressive you know if they dont go in you got another opportunity coming back oh bang menza working down low he hits the J now youre right dvo both Taylor and Bell a couple of the best Shooters on this team not big contributions so far just to combine one for nine well we you know cuff and Copeland and brown have been playing so well off the bench that I guess you really havent been talking about it but we were going to need those guys going into ACC play Syracuse is going to need I was a slasher I like to get to that rim so maybe youre a youre a mix of judin and Joe Gerard then Ill take it those are two solid players right there Niagara only trailing Syracuse by seven Mr Jude am minz he has 12 today four of eight from the field four from the line heres bumbalo has five threes today scoreless in this second half so far only 2 and A2 minutes inang menza down L covered by the smaller Taylor obioha Off the Mark rebound no bang men tries to go up for it cant get the shot off you see Niagara is trying to take advantage of Taylor being that smaller Defender worked out a couple times where at that left hand you know what Jud Miss has one of the best left hands in the country and I was a guy who I I love to use my left hand but you know after watching Judah play for a few years he is up there with having one of the best left hands Ive seen you talk about slashers hes one of the best in the country already averaging 20 a game fourth in points in the ACC fourth in steals per game two and theres another right on Q and theres what were talking about him being that capable Defender step through kick out right back to him over to Bell from Deep oh you bet you know what JJs not going to shoot it but that guy sure will Chris Bell hes a sharp shooter sniper Chris Bell thats his 30th three of the season hes shooting about 38 so far one of the best Shooters on this Syracuse team 4533 the C on top in the corner Tucker from deep that ones Off the Mark push out in transition Bell snags the pass puts it up off the glass and he gets two more Greg paus wants a timeout hes got to stop this Syracuse Squad 4733 or in John top well take a quick break you know what Greg he he hes just a great guy hes hes a great leader of these young men um and hes not hes hes just going to continue to excel um at the head coaching position you know whether it be Niagara or somewhere else Paul is a two sports star at CBA like you mentioned a McDonalds AllAmerican basketball player also a state champion winning quarterback theres Bumbo from deep that ones short paulus went on to play four years at Duke scored over 1000 points for Coach K led the ACC an assist per game as freshman year and then after four years of basketball he came back to Syracuse to do a grad year heres mince from Deep step backs off the mark the CL tried to put it back but couldnt tell you what though the separation right there was Elite Taylor hits the jumper to extend the lead and you love to see that for JT just a guy who seems like he was is lacking some confidence just to see the ball going in the rim you know hopefully that brings his confidence back up to where it needs to be its a 90 run for Syracuse those are Taylors First points of the day think I mentioned about Paul when he came back to Syracuse played quarterback in 09 and Doug marrones first season as head coach Squad went 4 and eight and he set a record completing 68 of his pass the highest in a single season for quarterback at Su I tell you what I I think as you see JT knocked down another three we talk about his confidence he I know youre hearing me out there but for a guy like Paul to not play a sport for four years and come in and you know break a School record is uh pretty amazing tell you the truth I he probably could have been an NFL quarterback if he would have stuck with football yeah we were talking the other day you said he he could do he go anywhere he wanted to out of high school not just in basketball but in football too hes a 2004 Gatorade national football player of the year in high school that was his junior year the same year that Adrien Peterson Maran Lynch and Calvin Johnson were also playing High School football wow and then coming from CBA CBA is a football school theyre still one of the top uh football schools right now in the state just a high school legend here in New York and he gets to come home and Coach against cuse hes got family at this game said yesterday hes just really happy to be back its really just a special time to be back home yeah a Syracuse Legend heres bumbalo over to B to the rim no foul called out of bounds it stays with Niagara and I tell you what Jack I know you see Syracuse in the in the two three out of the out of bounds but JJ Starling has been doing a great job of chasing bumbalo off those screens and forcing him into tough shots yeah hes going to make some like we saw in the first half but can he continue that the way that the orange are starting to pressure him and now we got cuff who is he a premier Defender up on him big second half adjustment shot clock winding down and he cant hit that shot 0 for three in the second half heres copelan nine points Off the Bench today to Starling no good on the three and you can still see that little hitch in his shot right there he just needs to catch it and go right up through Taylor defends that shot well and Syracuse is back in transition cin down the lane through contact cant get that one to go Bumble o with the board over to Marble the spin the shot off the glass and he finishes that was a tough move you know giving Syracuse a little taste of their own medicine getting out in Music transition nager finally getting a shot to fall down by 14 here in the second half Taylor from Deep oh he Nails it Let It Go Young and right on Q again I guess ever since that first shot weve been talking about him his confidence seems to be at where it needs to be JT its just good to see him playing well now hes just seems like your classic shooter where if hes in a rut you got to shoot yourself out of it right and you know what Jack not just a shooter hes hes hes got a really good body hes you know led the team in rebounding for you know a lot of games this season and hes a solid Defender he he has a lot that he can bring to the table there goes Taylor again he dumps it off that time copen in the corner from deep that one short brown on the rebound to Starling off the glass in in and theres Brown just a knack for the ball being around the rim and you know what hes a great interior passer which allow of big men arent at all Malik Brown seven points eight rebounds and an assist today Braxton bis finishes through contact with the and one yeah I mean talking about Malik Brown mean we we you you know talked about Copeland being the Swiss Armory knife I hes the same type of guy he he does so many things on the floor well uh hes a guy that you just you know you need a guy like this on the team to be able to fill that role and he does it to a te thats kind of what makes this Syracuse team special is that youve got like youve called them multiple Swiss Army knives Off the Bench someone as talented as Benny Williams a shooter like Kyle cuff just a lot of options we talked about their depth you know when one guy is not playing well next man up and you know they got a lot of guys who can come in and contribute they got guys who are versatile and athletic you know and thats why they can play the way they play fast enough Tempo and get up in you on the defensive side of the ball Taylor cant get that three to go go for four from Deep today got four points though but a pair of twos bis wants a screen wont use it down the lane the fake the spin in the score nice move and I tell you what young guards watching this guy play went into the paint played off two feet got his Defender up in the air Inc control on balance came back around that left shoulder with the right hand finish that was a great finish by bis and you mentioned earlier that thats something Niagara has done a nice job of is The Fakes whether its passing or shooting just getting those extra Open Spaces because of it well its funny I saw him in the pregame before you know before the game they were working on that exact move that bis just made so you know you can see why it works foul on Niagara One On LAN Irving Syracuse on top by 14 5743 were headed to break month of him being on the job the recruits that hes bringing in hes got me excited to watch Sher football next year he sounds like he can recruit just about anybody to play for his team done a nice job on the recruiting Trail and the transfer portal putting together a nice squad for next year full back here in Syracuse the orange are up over the purple Eagles by 14 with quer copelan on the line he was followed by Lance Irving before the break Oakland hits the next one two up by 15 heres Braxton bis got five points two rebounds and two assists today one of the only returners on this Niagara team the only return him and car obioha from last years squat goes up for the layup its off the mark tell you what cup got a piece of that showing his athletic ability we talked about he as and then running the Flor got to finish almost tatted on the other end hes a sneaky good athlete he surprises you he has that Kyle Lowry body or that Paul Pierce body which you might not think he is super athletic but hes a guy in in showing it in Oregon last game on The Fast Break dunk and then right here you know with to block we talked about those fouls you know Syracuse say and red is telling them right now you know the two with Judah and then the one right there with Kyle cuff you dont need those play play aggressive but stay in front but keep your hands to yourself telling Im talking to my kids right now keep your hands on yourself cuffs got two fouls so far hes only in his first full season of college ball played two games at Kansas last year but Torres MCL and PCL and practice early on in the season had to sit out the rest of the way I tell you what d n is not going to go away you know theyre excited to play here in the dome theyre going to compete you know regardless if they get down theyre still going to play Syracuse has to finish these plays only a 13point deficit right now theres Malik Brown on the perimeter he has a threepointer today as a first of the Season theres Copeland Cross Court to Benny Williams from Deep off the front rim but right right there that offensive possession it was side to side you seen the ball going side to side no downhill penetration not getting the defense to collapse and you can get a kick out you know when Syracuse plays like that you know thats when theyre going to struggle Syracuse plays its best ball when its in transition and scoring in the paint this teams scoring almost 40 points per game in the paint its most since the 2009 2010 season as bis is Tangled Up with brown ball will stay with the purple eagles they scor plenty in the paint and and I mean thats what they excel at getting out playing fast getting in transition getting easy buckets obviously Judah and JJ getting downhill you know making plays for theel but when you get into ACC conference play as we saw against Virginia theyre going to make it play in that half court you know if you cant execute and move the ball half court get downhill get by your Defenders and get an advantage you know theyre going to struggle you did you mentioned earlier that is something youve seen them do better as of late in these past few games is is the half court offense not just relying on the transition yeah and theyre capable its all about just getting movement right once you can get movement now you can get that Defender off his spot and thats when you can take advantage get downhill now that brings in The Help Defender and now theyre scrambling you know you could kick it out if he comes out and then you kick it to the corner or wherever its just about movement and then trying to find that Advantage where you get the Defenders off the spot and then you can attack another jump ball headed Syracuses way this time as Starling takes it up hes got four points and three rebounds today theres c one in his bright pink shoes the spin works it all the way around St at the elbow out to Williams driving down the lane its picked off again stagnant stagnant on the offensive end bis dishes Bullock by puff cin recovers pushing in front the spin oh tried to get the pass to Williams but he couldnt Mr crafty trying to get it done yeah Mr crafty but make the simple Play heres Kyle cof getting up for this one hes got some Music bounce tell you what ever since we said he about talked about his athleticism he comes out and gets two blocks theyre hearing us out here Jack there he is from Deep oh oh Kyler pu Nails it we got to keep talking about these guys thats all it is man theyre hearing us out there getting the job done deos got the Golden Touch today seven points for Kyle cuff Off the Bench bumo down the lane gets foul and and just right there you know it was a tough play tough but when youre making a guy make two three dribble moves change directions youre tired after that so you know coming back down hes not going to have the legs he had going into his shot so you know cuff did a good job he just has to be able to finish that defensive possession and you know cut off that angle to the Music rim heres Luke bumbalo at the line 17 points today but none here in this second half well make that number one hes 0 of three from the field Ball State transfer and a great score for this Niagara Team 17 today he had 16 last time out hes had over three threes and three straight games out of Newcastle Indiana in his fifth year a former Indiana Mr basketball finalist back in 2019 he didnt win the award because that was Trace Jackson Daviss to win the high flyer that played for the hoers of Indiana Indiana is known for some big time basketball their high school basketball games could get 20000 Brown sores and slams great roll to the rim Malik big energy Off the Bench for Malik Brown twohanded Jam extends the lead great hedge out by Malik right there just to be able to stop that from continuing crosscourt pass from bumbalo Bullock hits the deck its a foul call called that one on Malik Brown soaring through the air and finishing big time nine points for Mr Malik Brown off the on a good note against a good pitchburg team who was scoring the ball at a high clip averaging 81 points a game Su playing pit on the 30th then they go to Duke to or January 2nd then BC in North Carolina not an easy stretch to the start of ACC play but something tells me none of these stretches in ACCC play will be easy I I tell you what every game that you play isnt going to be easy even this game you know Niagara yeah theyre three and seven but if Syracuse overlooks a team like this you know it could be a loss we talked about the Trap game if if Syracuse is engaged and locked in I mean theyre they have a talent a a talented roster as anybody in the country you know we talked about their depth uh if theyre connected on the defensive side of the ball theyre communicating theyre getting playing fast and then we talked about the half court if they can execute and move the ball theyll theyll be able to compete with anybody in the country o bang menza hits both free throws Niagara going full court there goes cuff facing pressure Now Syracuse will have nine days off before it plays pit they go on a Christmas break do you think its tough to come back from that long of a layoff or is it good to let the legs rest no I think its good to let the legs rest you know who cop to Benny Williams now is that the Benny Williams that were trying to see okay we talked about his athleticism hes the most athletic guy on the floor when he can do that hes engaged hes locked in again this Syracuse basketball team is a totally different team when he does that there he goes Benny Williams on the rebound again headed the other way he loses this one oang menah gets it right back B tipped away L Brown defending cant finish that one he gets it the second time around now going back to Benny Williams play within your strength right I mean you know youre not a guy whos really going to bring the ball up and push it get it into the point guards hands or a guards hands and then get out and run the wing and get another lob for a dunk Syracuse up by 14 kind of where this lead has been most of the second half not fully pulling away because this Niagara teams playing tough theyre going to compete but you know what you got to give Syracuse credit theyve done a good job of taking the taking care of the ball so far in this game feed from Copeland to Brown he lays it up at in thats assist number five for quer coper Mr do it all Le Browns got himself a solid day two 11 points and eight rebounds and on top of him being a you know just having a knack around the rim hes one of the top Defenders at his positions in the country I mean just how he could hedge out how he could switch how hes able to get deflections talk about defense how about Benny Williams on this block climbing the ladder two hands not making it easy it seems that Syracuse you know you look at uh the typical Syracuse for we always Syracuse always has some of the most athletic guys in the country I mean you go back talking about you know guys like Wes Johnson and uh you know he had a 46 inch vertical you know CJ Fair guys like that so you know this team is no different you know we talked about the depth that they have and everybody who seems to come in in that forward position is an athletic guy I always think of James southernland in that category too and he can shoot that thing he had one game he had I think he had 10 threes against Arkansas bis with the contact puts it off the glass having himself a solid day hes got seven B has been impressive getting to the rim getting downhill and finishing tough tough contested finish vce throws that one off the glass I think he was confused whether he wanted to shootter give it up to Benny Williams in the lob as bumo hits the deck yeah he just got caught in between thinking he was going to go up or pass it either way its headed for the golden eagles after the foul on quader Copeland thats his third so far today and and I think another thing is you know we talk about a Syracuse team they are young even though they freshman last year you know play the majority of the game right they have that experience decision making comes into play right you still want to make those those right reads and those right decisions and then defensively when to foul when not to foul right were not we dont have to foul you know on a full court get back play defense especially when you know you can keep those guys in front of you now it is a young team team but Adrien ay after Oregon said know we feel like a veteran Squad now because of you know how hard the schedules been getting to play against Gonzaga and Tennessee and all those tough games theyve kind of been in all of these competitive situations already these guys have grown up quickly well we mentioned last year a lot a lot of these freshman were playing big minutes last year so they have that game experience uh and then coming into this year just feeling a little bit more comfortable even though they are sophomore but these guys have game experience and theyve played in some big moment so you know they know what to do whole lot of sophomores that get rotational minutes for this Su team four of them on the court right now and Benny Williams the eldest member of the group a junior theres Min up top cross over couldnt kick it out there he goes Rudy cide he loses it Williams is right there get it up to him heres mince taking it himself and one Judah Min is a menace down low cant stop him tough you know what making up for that you know the previous play and that was him just not recognizing the defense coming in and helping he should have kicked it out earlier but you know Benny Williams gets a steal then he gets it back out and thats where we excel at getting downhill getting in transition and and like we talked about before Judah minz is one of the elite finishers in the country Judah mince with a nice lay in through contact headed to the free throw line once again I think he gets his mail delivered to the charity stripe he lives there I tell you what and I dont think people understand how difficult those finishes are he he does a great job of controlling his body while taking the contact and still being able to finish through couldnt nail that free throw iager corals it back on offense Syracuse offense has been hot hting five of its last six bis looks all the way around quick ball movement o Menzel loses it foul call you know right there you know Syracuse did a great job of scrambling it and making Niagara keep making that extra pass when we talked about finishing that defensive play it it just hurts you as a team when you do a great 25 seconds of defense and then you foul those last two two Syracuse with 10 fouls this half any foul will put him on the line for two now o b mens first shot is Off the Mark he has 11 points and 11 rebounds thats his first free throw Miss three for four now some added size on this Niagara team we talked about Haron obioha earlier the sevenfooter but to have a 67 68 guy that can move like oang men is really important for a smaller team he pretty versatile you see him you hes playing inside outside hes done a good job around the rim you seen him hit a couple jump shots hes a good player for this Niagara team full court pressure by the purple Eagles darling looking to free up space and he gets through the pressure V waves him off and says you take this out to Copeland down low to Brown Up the twohanded Jam Malik Brown letting his presence be known in the paint and really we you know we could go down there every single time if we we could really dominate this team were and just impose our will with our size tough defense that ones out of bounds sticking with Niagara Syracuse team in the last few games the orange have certainly played some tough defense getting tight on guys getting in the passing Lanes really a tenacious style of D and they have we talked about they have the versatility they have the depth to be able to get up and play that style of Defense I think the biggest thing for them early on was rotations were slow communication wasnt there and over these past 3 four games G you could really start to see him coming together heres Starling fighting through the full court press once again vce off the tip heres Copeland through contact off the glass and in man they have multiple guys that can finish tough shots at The Rim being able to go up and take the contact and then be able to finish through the contact its a tough finish by Copeland bumo the nice finish hold that Copeland thats Bumble get into the room he said Ill take what you did maybe make it even a little better 7360 Syracuse on outstanding just like they were against Oregon one of the members of that bench Malle Brown he showed out today 13 points and eight rebounds he barely misses any shots either hes five of five today shooting over 70 on the season talk about a guy that just knows his role and plays with his strength thats Malik Brown right there Malik Brown has I mean we saw it last year as a freshman you know he he came in and showed what hes capable of doing and now obviously in the sophomore year hes going to have a bigger role and get more minutes and he is exceeding um what coach red has thought he could do Jah men calls timeout facing that fullcourtpr done a nice job taking care of the ball today Syracuse only six turnovers the orange here in the dome but Syracuse football is down in boa rone in sunny Florida Syracuse taking on USF in the bowl game tonight six and six in the regular season looking for win number seven newly led by Fran Brown you mentioned earlier just doing a nice job and bringing in new recruits he is doing an unbelievable job I mean the best job Ive seen since Ive been here in a month Ive seen more you know four and five star recruits than than I have in 10 years come here so he hes done an unbelievable job that you know people are excited about you know Syracuse football and its great for the University to be able to have Syracuse basketball and Syracuse you know football competing at a high level now you mentioned building a team in Adrien Autreys first year yes a lot of these guys are coach beah heims players but when you look at guys like Kyle cuff nahem McLoud and JJ Starling those are guys that he brought in hes really kind of lucky to have this group that you know you said earlier is just great to have in your first year and I tell you what coach red has done an unbelievable job of just letting these guys play feeding these guys confidence you know you can make a mistake and Im still going to let you play play through it you know guys need like need that especially nowadays kids are a little bit different and I think coach red has done a great job of giving these guys confidence you know as they you know continue throughout the year Syracuse eight and three on the season taking on Pittsburgh next thats on December 30th tough ACC schedule ahe head shot clock winding down Ms from Deep cant get it to fall Brown in the rebound copelan down low no cant finish in attended niagaras way Malik Brown keeping it keeping the Play Alive I mean thats what he does hes just a guy he he gets his hands all over all over types of balls you know deflections you know defensively and offensively keeping plays alive you hes a guy that I would love to play with nine rebounds for Malik Brown today surprisingly Syracuse and Niagara both have 35 rebounds not an area the orange have excelled at this season theres bis with the runner he hits that cuts the deficit to 11 theyre not going to quit these guys are going to compete and their coach is not a quitter I tell you that hes a guy who competed at a high level in his career hes going to be able to you know give that to these guys as well Vince the spin off the glass cant finish oh that would have been incredible Bumbo the other way from Deep no good Judah Mintz going for the 360 layup with John Wall shot right there I tell you what that that would have been a tough finish right there but you know keep it as simple as you can man I know he can finish that but you know sometimes you just go and lay that thing up Starling from deep in the corner yes that you know what that looked great smooth right to the pocket boom and right through it no hitch we know he you know he was a McDonalds All American coming out of high school and he was labeled a shooter we know he can shoot the ball its just about being confident and we know that guy can shoot the ball speaking of Shooters Luke bumbalo hitting three number six on the day hes got 26 points leading the way Syracuse on top by 11 JJ Starling hitting this three and like you mentioned he was a sharp shooter at ball second half hasnt made it easy for Syracuse the orange to only have six turnovers today least on the season is seven Min off his foot turnover headed niagaras way just like coach paulus Drew up at full court press going to work Judah mins second turnover of the day well we jinxed him jack jinx again its the announcers Jinx theres Juan Marvel Jor with the two holds it within single digits and Syracuse just wants to finish this game strong not only to get a win but having that momentum that theyre in feeling good about how theyre playing you know going into the break another turnover purple Eagles jump right on it here comes Bumbo to Irving down low Niagara turns it over here comes mince down the lane onehanded finish off the glass and a sigh of relief right there s of Rel you know both teams turning the ball over back and forth B through contact nice finish off the glass tell you what these last 3 4 minutes Syracuse has just been lackluster on the defensive end the effort and energy hasnt been there like it needs to be Vince the brown that bus the dagger for the cuse and Syracuse is going to end up winning this game but you know they got a lot of things they have to look at going into ACC play if they want to be able to compete you know with some of the toughest teams have a day Malik Brown 15 points theres Luke Bumbo cant get it to go Syracuse will have to dribble this one out dejected look on head coach Greg Pauls face coached won heck of a game today thats for sure you know what hes a leader man he he and I told like the story back in 2005 you know he was in this room looking at the play but looking at the scout and and from that point on you just knew this guy was going to be a head coach at some program and you know he hes going to continue to get these guys better uh he hes an elite head coach great to see JT knocking it down playing well I think hes in the double figures now Taylor hits the triple and youre right Deo hes got 11 three threes for Mr Taylor today Syracuse has four players with double digits and I tell you what Jack if you have your guys like Chris Bell Justin Taylor able to knock down jump shots its just going to make it easier for Judah and JJ getting downhill and be able to get into their driving Lads because if theyre knocking down their shots that defense cant collapse like they want to Taylors done a decent decent job this season shooting hes about 32 from three coming into this game hasnt really been asked to score a ton only has four games in double digits and that was Cornell Shaman kesas and New Hampshire number five today as he has 11 points hes shot the ball really well three of four from Deep also three rebounds too but I I I also think hes a guy thats capable and I think if he went in and was aggressive and more assertive you know coach red wouldnt say anything to him he he wants him to do that he wants him to be aggressive out there it just gives us another option offensively Syracuse dribbles this one out and moves to 9 and three the orange have won four in a row after a win over there New York State fax
