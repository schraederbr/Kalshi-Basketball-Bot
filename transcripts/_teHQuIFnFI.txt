Music time breaks it is Kevin Keith sixth year at the Helm of the wolf pack what a job hes done there are a lot of naysayers when this season got underway in Raleigh North Carolina no longer the case they can win their 20th game tonight so NC State coming in at 19 and five nine and four in the conference Virginia is 17493 in the ACC and we are underway as the Cavaliers win the opening tip and you see jacquesco Joyner picking up Kihei Clark Beyond half court thats something to pay attention to today jacquel Joyner just as disruptive defensively as is key head Virginia coming off a tough road loss at Blacksburg on Saturday good basketball game they never once had the lead in it Franklin on the drive leaves it short and Gant comes able to rebound for the wolf pack NC state has played well lately in this rivalry in fact right here that won the last two games and look forward to seeing the basketball and DJ Burns hands often but turns it over on the first possession the Trap has worked for Virginia early Stephen going to work in the paint Gardner whos had a hot hand lately and he gets the first bucket uh Jane Gardner averaging about 18 points a game the last three for the hoos and coming into the season you would have expected Jayden Garner to be the lead he scored for the hoos but hes been just that down the stretch burns on the entry nice fettery touch by the 69 Brad gonna be interesting to see how Tony Bennett goes at defending DJ Burns throughout this game that time they left him 101 hell win that matchup versus Bennett Enterprise now youre talking about the best offense in the ACC and the wolf pack the best defense statistically in the ACC in Virginia so this ones certainly a battle of ultimate strengths Bounder plus gets it and lays it in good sign early for Virginia then advantaplace with scoreless against Virginia Tech on Saturday first time since hes been in the starting lineup Joyner averaging 16 points a game chairman Smith averaging 19 points a game Smith with it here hes going to launch from way downtown comes right back to Burns in the lane theyll get a second crack at him foreign s playing really well coming in hes an excellent passer and that turns into a hoop from the corner drilled by Casey Marcel who is back in Virginia for the first time he played his first two years for Tony Bennett OB some hoops me more than others that was a big basket for Casey Marcel and for the wolf pack hes really shooting the ball too hes come a long way and as Tony Bennett said we talked to him his office for the game he said this offense for the wolf pack really suits him it absolutely is and hes a perfect compliment toward the guards for NC State as dick Raymond Smith will pick up the first foul trying to strip the basketball but we talked about DJ Burns being trapped in his passing is extraordinary that time the Cross Court to the corner to five Casey Marcel knocking down his first shot back in jpj as a member of the wolf back of course he was a who for two years Music Applause two out of the corner there but he is hitting 44 percent from threepoint land theyve actually changed that now to a threepoint basket Jamie lucky going over and checking the tape during the break in the action Jamie along with Roger Ayers and Jeffrey Clark the officials tonight great crew for a big game and OB this is a huge game as far as ACC standings as far as implications Franklin on the penetration and draws the foul about three minutes in Armon Franklin who has held it just six points by the Hokies on Saturday Music and draws the foul goes against Burns and thatll put Armond to the line we make 71 percent Music fun and ties the game 55 Applause it is a big night in the ACC and a late night here at the University of Virginia and John Paul Jones are in it Dave OBrien and Corey Alexander thanks so much for being with us its big because if Virginia wins tonight and that is a tall order against outstanding NC State team but if they do well have a threeway tie atop the ACC and OB Ill look at it as theyre saving the best for last Youve Got A ranked matchup NC State coming in at number 22 nationally Virginia at number eight in a big battle as you see and hear the Ovation for Kate Cedric coming onto the court for his first time did not play on Saturday at Virginia Tech Tony Bennett going to Shedrick early Applause Virginia taking a loss there against their rivals in Blacksburg in a hard plot game his DJ burns the 69 grad crowd wanted to walk here chartel Joyner has been terrific averaging 16 a game off Target there and right through the lane Marcels going to tap it out Casey Marcel a big story here as the former Virginia Cavalier returns to Charlottesville for the first time since he transferred its his second year but under Tony Bennett initially hes a much better offensive player right now in this offense for the Wolfpack isnt it hes a much more comfortable player in the offense for NC State than he was but he also have to consider hes two years older two years wiser and Reese Beekman who continues to get healthier and better each and every time out goes and gets a bucket early so an A5 lead for the Cavaliers their number eight NC State score he mentioned in the top 25 first time since December of 82 that NC State is ranked in the top 25 in both Carolina and Duke are not under 10 to get up a shot Marcel on the drive with a turnaround knocks it down hes hit a couple of shots early and Casey Moore sales being greeted by booze from the Virginia student section however it has not deterred him at all two for two from the field and looking very aggressive on the offensive end been a factor for the wolf pack not only tonight but hes averaging 13 points five rebounds a game Garner on the spin and from behind on Ernest Ross on the Block attempts as he went for the slam 87 Virginia on NC State very early in Charlottesville End Zone touchdown back at John Paul Jones 87 Virginia leading NC State David Corey with it and games like this are always really interesting because you know the definitive strengths of both teams theres no gray area you know NC State is the best offensive team in the conference Virginia is the best defensive team statistically in the conference and when you think about these two Styles classic if you think about the fact that Kevin Keatons won the last two meetings in this building and won three of the last four against Virginia is so in one of the very few teams that shoot 60 percent ever against Tony Bennett its only happened twice in Tony Bennetts career one of those was last season to Kevin Keats in the NC State Wolfpack so two different styles and gonna make a great game here this evening Gardner at the line where he hits 62 percent is coming off a string of strong efforts 20 points Saturday against Blacksburg in the loss along with 10 rebounds so whatever went wrong there was not his fault and of course Jake Gardner was at all ACC performer a year ago Virginias leading scorer hes starting to get back into form on the offensive end right now of the guy we saw a season to go Marcel handing off for Smith Burns Another Touch look at the triple on him trying to fight his way out of it again the crowd calling for a walk there a lot of contact they saved there on the Baseline by Ross got to get off a shot here Smith barely got to the iron and itll go the other way back to Virginia Applause Ill tell you what the students are revved up for this one they absolutely arent obso is so are the whos Virginias last two games the first halves have not been great for them at Syracuse they struggled allow the orange to shoot 64 percent and then struggle of course gave up 74 points to Virginia Tech on Saturday but what were seeing right now is a defensive effort that we were expecting from Virginia all season long Burns will take a break dewana the 611 Junior will come on now for Kevin Keats remember the wolf pack last year just 11 and 21 a lot of debilitating injuries Clark dishing downstairs Gartner cant finish it so this is remarkable with the wolf act theyve been able to do they were picked to finish 10th in the ACC by the media before the year got underway Zane Gardner going down in the painted area Applause and slow to rise but he is up a little bit hobbled was defending Ebenezer dwana not sure what happened there but just went to the floor glad to see him back up and moving heading to the bench however it benefits will replace Gardners dewana was unable to make the the layup but something we have to keep an eye on NC State showing theyre going to pressure Virginia off of Main shots as well as dead balls theyre going to pick Virginia up 94 feet make them continue to work now well keep an eye on Jaden Gardner is such a key offensive guy and a time out here Jade Gardner headed back to the locker room Obi yes well not to fight the locker room but Ethan Saliba going to take him into the hallway you see that left ankle turn and of course painful as it may be but honestly a great sign to see that it was an ankle turning in comparison to another noncontact injury and the crew has gone to the monitor too to see if maybe something occurred there that might warrant additional attention yeah nothing there nothing against the one on that possession and of course they dont have the benefit of instant replay like we do to see that it was actually an ankle that took him down Roger air is coming over to clarify that so no flagrants there 14 40 to go here in the first half Music yeah well keep an eye on Gardner obviously and check on him and his progress to return Applause Music Applause Beekman keeps on driving left hand blocked by duana and thats what dawanna does again hes not the offensive player that youre going to get with DJ burns on the floor but he is a much greater run protector Smith off Target there but it comes free to Ross and hell get a second effort heres Smith he gets a lot of shots in the air so far he has yet to hit anything by the way NC State one for five from threepoint land Music Clark shutter trying to finish he does and he takes a hit as well hell be at the line Shedrick got a nice hand when he came on as you pointed out because he was missing in action over the weekend and Blacksburg didnt play a minute and Kane Cedric in the right spot able to finish through contact gets the foul and you see the emotion from Katie Cedric after the bucket happy to be getting this opportunity once again on the floor for Tony Bennett and trying his best to prove to coach Bennett he deserves to be back in the rotation what Shedrick who is a native of Raleigh looking for a threepoint play and he does and thats the largest lead so far here for Virginia Applause NC State averaging 80 points a game Smith the top scorer in the conference Joyner off the fake and they give it back with a slab will finish that one off Applause NC state has been doing a remarkable job of not turning the ball over the last five or six ball games now listen to this crowd Smith down the lane and that rolls in for The Talented 64 sophomore but OB in Virginia is going to make it that difficult for taquavion Smith to score Virginia will win this game if you think about the defensive effort that theyre putting forth right now and again you and Ive called the last two Virginia games it hasnt looked like this for them early but they are tuned in here tonight Thunder plus back to the Freshman McNeely and thats off Target although hes been shooting the ball very very well 44 beyond the threepoint line Reese Beekman oftentimes isnt as aggressive as he should be led the ACC and steals a year ago another one here and showing that hes getting healthy with the finish on the break we may see that later on Sports Center will be pretty good bet he just picked up his first foul by the way Music so 159 Virginia Applause working on the rookie off the fake and well draw the foul before the shot McNeely has been drawing a lot of comparisons lately here at Virginia to a couple of guys who are outstanding as freshmen guys like Joe Harris to your partner six grand and he was not gone for very long and a great sign for the Cavaliers absolutely great to see Jayden Garner back on the floor Smith there born and a block and Shedrick does that an awful lot doesnt he he absolutely does one of the top ACC shot blockers even though hes playing limited minutes right now still getting the job done when hes on the floor Applause clock making a move on the drive left hand and lays it in Applause Polaris looking sharp early on in this one and love the way Virginias guards are attacking the basket being very decisive not looking to pass the basketball Purcell around and outs another good look for Casey Marcel nice fine by DJ Burns Blow by by Clark hell throw it away though right to Smith but that goes back into the running to pass and look at the quick effort to get it on the iron Anyway by Joyner but he cannot convert and it goes back over to Virginia Applause theyre a terrific fast break team and those are plays they usually do cash in on and Kihei Clark passing in on his way to the basket finishing with the left hand and the whos are a Cruz playing well tonight know me youre talking about a guy who was only averaging seven and a half minutes per game in the last five before he did not play against Virginia Tech but also a young man who started 14 of the first 15 games for Virginia and has won the leading shot blockers in the ACC finding his way back into Tony Bennetts rotation right now and has done a great job in this game finding his way back we talked with Tony been a pregame about Kate and cheddar he said hes doing the work hes putting in the time theyve been playing well with Bennett benepas at the five but he was going to get a chance tonight and hes making the best of big block threepoint play in his early minutes Applause Cavaliers with a basketball he a clock 40 percent outside the three McNeely could be deadly out there you could tell coming off the hand that was bottoms and McNeely makes the shot of course Kihei Clark gets the assist but give Katie Shedrick a lot of credit for setting a big screen not allowing his former teammate Casey Marcel to get through Burns back in draws a lot of attention Joyner on Clark to the paints off the fake too strong so the Cavaliers ranked number eight in the country up 209 Obi weve got to mention the guards for NC State both coming off their lowest scoring games of the season five points for Joyner as well as taquavion Smith 10 points combined still able to win that game versus Georgia Tech Shedrick a little too strong there Music comes for Joyner mistransfer yeah those two guys right now combined one for nine from the field so the shooting woes have continued here in Charlottesville Burns one big body and it popped out of his hands he got it back thats too strong Gardner with the board and Jaden Gardner appears to be fully recovered you see came off the court for a couple of minutes looked like he turned an ankle and Kane Cedric a little gas right now asking for a sub to get out and DJ Burns fortunate to be able to get away with the push on that one NC State started three for five shooting theyre one for 10 since then Applause Smith trying to get started against Clark and drops in two its a quavion Smith just using a height advantage on Kihei Clark there Kihei played it tough forcing the fade away but of course theres not a shot and dequavion cant make four points so far catch and thats going to roll in tough play for Shedrick got us to go though it absolutely was one of the best past year clock has thrown throughout his career but Katie Cedric the presence of mind to lay it up and compassion to try and dunking it and getting the bucket Smith with a triple got that maybe he is starting to catch fire well that thats the one advantage that taquavion Smith has he will play of course within the team concept hell do everything as for the team but he has the ability to start breaking plays off and go do his own thing and and take advantage of his opportunity to score oneonone he said some big big games Gardner yes boy thats a shot he really likes he is automatic in those spots youre talking about in the dunk the spot along the Baseline 1015 feet away from the basket you may as well just count it whenever he shoots it Applause burns out of the double right into the chest of Shedrick and thats going to be an offensive on the big fella DJ Burns and that is going to be his third foul I should say third colonel and looking good and Jake Gardner playing great basketball as of late we watched him walk off after rolling his ankle going back into the tunnel with defensive coming back in the game getting that short Corner because he loved so much knocking down the easy bucket he may as well call that a layup for Jake Gardner still not looking 100 and grimacing as he sits down but last three games 18 points per game shooting lights out and also hitting the glass and hes undersized at 66 but also has over 2 000 points and over a thousand rebounds one the only active player in division one basketball to have those type of numbers so Jaden Gardner knows his way around the basketball floor has done it well for a very long time fouls on burns by the way two now for him and hes sitting at least at the moment alongside Kevin Keats matter plus downstairs gets tied up almost gave it away shot clock is down to five for Virginia Franklin working on Joyner off the window and camp with a big rebound and thats a big rebound again because Ryan Dunn who has been known to come in and dunk those putting people on posters was on his heels to come put that one back in now for NC State this is an absolutely dynamic backcourt between Smith and Joyner are they the best in the lead you know what they come in and they feel as though theyre the best in the league and I asked both those guys earlier if they were the best jacquel Joyner said hands down well show it tonight to Cleveland asked who else would it be and I told him hey these guys in Virginia are pretty good and the guys in Miami would like to get in there I believe the guys in Miami would be in that conversation as well mishandled air off done out and with under seven to go that is just their second turnover but to qualify I did talk with jacquel Joyner about the fact that Im including all three so it will be dark yellow and Casey Marcel then you also talk about Kihei Clark three Speakman and Arman Franklin and I believe thats where when you start talking about all three players in the backboard is where Miami loses a little bit Wilco popular is very good in more of a defensive player right now but I think thats where these two teams have the advantage over Miami Im telling you watching Miami last night they didnt do one single thing other than perfect against Duke they absolutely rolled in that one very impressive Marcel leaning in and the act of going up for a threes thats gonna be three shots smart play by Casey Marcell gets him on Franklin in the air and again when you do that you have to be smart not to go outside of your natural motion because it can be caught an offensive foul at that point so were going to hear from the crowd here as Casey Marcel goes to the free throw line for three it gives a more than enough time to Boom not real happy that he left the University of Virginia Marcel this is in a pregame with Tony Bennett from her coach little Embrace there Smiles with his former teammates is enjoying a really fine year the senior from Maryland great young man not just good a great young man and had some success here at Virginia but when its all said and done I believe the style of play for Kevin Keach fits Casey Marcel better than the style of Play Fit for him here at Virginia and hes been able to excel this season head is ACC career high 17 points last time out first Georgia Tech went to favion Smith and jar kill Joyner did not have their best offensive games Casey Marcel showed up big for the wolf number two in the ACC and threepoint accuracy now one of the things that Tony Bennett said was hes a more efficient player hes really worked at that but Obi one things for certain youre gonna be better in your fourth year of college normally than you are in your second no doubt No Doubt approaching the six minute Mark and only 16 points for NC State McNeely yes thats a twopointer for the feathery touch McNeely has been aggressive early his third field goal attempt and now hes starting to go into his individual package going off the bounce not necessarily just a catch and shoot guy Smith has started to cook on a blowby thats going to be goaltending so count that day on Smith has games where hes not going to be as aggressive shooting the basketball and 10 assists last time out first Georgia Tech wasnt scoring the ball but made sure he continued to contribute it looks like now hes saying his team is struggling to score so hes going to be aggressive attacking the basket looking for his opportunities youre talking about the accs leading scorer at 18 and a half points a game hes not going to let this game go by without him having some type of input Virginia is not letting the Wolfpack get out and run not very often they do not have a single fast spray Point yet and its a big part of their attack it absolutely is they had an opportunity but jarco Joyner actually missed a wide open layup Applause starting her up to set a screen back here for Kihei Clark McNeely with the save shot clock at eight Vander Blossom to the paints shock lock down to five and the Freshman cant connect doing a great job on the glass Applause oftentimes in there by himself but allowing his team to get out and run a little bit knowing that hes going to take care of the board Smith shoved off Clark cant hit it off the heel and Garner tears down to rebound hes getting about five a game Beekman through didnt finish it on the run now here comes sir quavion Smith through the lane denied once again Virginia gets back defensively on a break and Virginia has numbers here see if theyll take advantage of it Clark underneath and bumped and fouled hell be heading to the line fouled by Ernest Ross the 69 sophomore 429 to go thatll be his second foul speaking of smart plays GA Clark super smart recognizing no way Ernest Ross would be able to stay in front of him and keep him away from getting to the basket the grad out of Woodland Hills California he is number one alltime in the ACC in minutes played how about that hes going to be number one in a many different categories Music basketball presented by Subway on Saturday Pitt continues to be a great story they blew out Louisville today taking on Virginia Tech at five into Clemson and Louisville at 7 pm all come up Saturday on the ACC Music networks in he has four back up to a 10point Advantage for the Cavaliers this is the first time I believe this season kieh Clark is playing against a guard thats just as quick and just as heady as he is and jacquel Joyner and right now Kia is ahead in this battle between these two players Rochelle got a good look Shedrick with another rebound hes really shown up in his first half he absolutely has I love the fact that he didnt pout about not playing on Saturday but hes come in and given his team everything that he can early in this game Applause Beekman nice dish for Gardner got it Applause boy everything swinging the Cavaliers way back up to their largest lead the Duncan temp wont go Beekman out of the pack with it great job by Marcel covering up McNeely not giving him a look Isaac McNeely knocked down threepoint shooter could have got one in transition clock with that hesitation very nearly gave it away its loose and it is scooped up by the wolf pack Here Comes Smith Corner jumper on the way and that wont drop for Joyner so theyre one and done and Joyner still scoreless over five from the field over two from three in 16 minutes here in this first half Music yeah the pack just two for ten from threepoint land and a shot and a foul the shutter going down Gantt knocking him to the deck NC state has missed their last six and Virginias clicking on top 30 to 18 under three to go in the half go back and look at Virginia their past three games they allow Syracuse to shoot 64 percent at the dome last week and then on Saturday Virginia Tech shot 51 for the game against Virginia right now NC State shooting 269 for six percent from the field and Virginias defense is starting to look like the Virginia Virginia Defense weve known to grow and love over the past 10 years that Tony Bennett has been here in Charlottesville a couple of years have taken jerkill Joyner out of the game to this point and DJ burns with a couple of fouls has been sitting for a long time thats going to be short by Joyner battle for the rebound theyll get a second crack heres Smith to Loft it and thatll stick possession arrow well keep it on this end 2 30 to go and NC state has missed seven in a row no points in the last three minutes Obi we got a wedge you didnt let the world know I cant even say the word it happened to me so often as a young kid not you you were the coolest dude in the school its a nightmare Smith with a nice spin but cant connect Virginias made everything difficult for the Cleveland Smith for jaquel Joyner throughout this game and youre talking about not only guys who are great offensively youre talking about some of the best defensive guards in the ACC and throughout the country when you mentioned Kihei Clark Reese Beekman darkell Joyner and taquavion Smith these four guys we knew it would be a tremendous battle but its been onesided in this first half its been all about the whos here on their home floor join her with the personal put clock at the line and hes shooting a 11 Kihei 77 percent Applause but a huge story here with under two minutes to go in the first half Ross with a leaner and wont hit it NC state has been held to 18 points very frustrating half of the Wolfpack are you talking about the team that leads the ACC is scoring over 79 and a half points per game and right now 18 points in the first 18 minutes of this first half Gardner gets a look and sixes and he is feeling good about himself right now we have to remember Jane Gardner is from Wake Forest North Carolina and for those thinking Wake Forest is near Wake Forest University you would be wrong it is near Raleigh North Carolina very close to NC State Smith just lost it Clark wants to run up against Joyner and slapped out Luana got a hand on it a minute 10 to go in half Applause 3218 Virginia Music Applause to the top of Shedrick Music Applause Music right now Reece Beacon with a mismatch surprise he did not try to take Ernest Ross off the dribble Feed The Gardener nearly stolen away shoved up there but a misfire by Beekman Applause to push the tempo again a lot of turnovers here for the Wolfpack the bouts for Gardner and the stuff they made him pay didnt they they absolutely did miscommunication on the break for NC State Joyner was throwing that pass to Smith in the corner Ernest Ross thought it was for him ends up being a turnover and a duck on the other end for Jane Garden the fans are up here in Charlottesville its an eightnothing run and a timeout with 186 seconds to go a quick one 30 seconds and then were back in and this one man Rays Beekman dropping it off to Jake Gardner with the finish the ankle looks like its feeling just fine and weve talked about the different places to play in the ACC wheres the toughest place to play I can tell you right now this place John Paul Jones Arena here on grounds of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville has to be close to the top of the list throughout the ACC Music final seconds of the first half to quavion Smith up for Marcel Burns in play with two personals hell turn and fire and swishes it in is Beekman with a heave would have counted had it gone but it does not but Virginia holds NC State to their first half low just 20 points and Virginia getting great production from many different players but Kaden Cedric back into the lineup getting minutes on the sidelines and well see if they can do it again in the second half Virginia leading the ACC and defense coming in anyway yeah they have the basketball to begin the second half here John Paul Jones founder plus gives it up Garden of the star of the first half offensively heres Beekman shot clock to Eights hell drive it on Ross who commits the foul and it was with seven on a shot clock theyre going to give that one to Marcel the number two on Casey Marcel in for Clark off the fake a dribble down burns on him draped all over him Burns in foul trouble in the first half Beekman on the drive past him man scores it nice finish by Reese Beekman avoiding the shot block for contorting his body in midair to be able to get the finger roll give him six along with three assists a 3620 advantage I want every time that man touches the ball hes got at least two men on him and a prostration foul too yeah he compounded the turnover with the foul already playing with two fouls reaches out grabs Reese Beekman picks up the third foul speaking of Beekman getting to the basket and you see his ability to contort his body to avoid Ernest Ross there get it up on the glass for the bucket and the officials are going to go over and review to see if this is a flagrant on DJ Burns theyre taking a look if this is an intentional to stop a fast break here so 16 point Advantage here for Virginia as Roger Ayers goes to the monitor good to see Roger back at Virginia it absolutely is great to see him back Roger Ayers had to take three years off from officiating Virginia games as you see DJ Burns reaching out grabbing Reese Beekman on there Roger Airs daughter Lakin Ayers graduated from the University of Virginia in three years three years while Roger while she was in school here Roger could not officiate University of Virginia games wow so he pushed her along got his daughter to graduate in three years so therefore he could come back was able to come back and do the first game of the season here in Charlottesville and went up to Tony Bennett to shake his hand Tony told him hey Roger we missed you but weve been doing pretty well here without you so dont mess it up yeah you get through Virginia in three years you are one smart student absolutely youre in a different League kudos to Lake and her father is very proud of her and delighted save dads and Bucks too by getting out of school in just three years so itll be Beekman to the line it is a flagrant wine Applause and drops in the foul shot another one coming when you see just out of frustration DJ Burns reaching out in the first foul he maybe would have gotten away with but it was the second reach that let it be known he was doing it with intent and therefore of course no intentional foul in college basketball so it is a flagrant one so this is the largest deficit that NC state has faced all season long as theyre down 18 Applause and Beekman looking to add to that Applause a swing here for Franklin Applause very patiently they get it to Gardner batter plus underneath and they do add on and they double up the wolf pack 40 to 20 I mean this is a smart play Jayden Gardner being patient recognizing vanderplas has a mismatch with a guard trying to defend him Virginia now with a 228 advantage on points in the paint thats a giant number there are a lot of them tonight Cavaliers favor nearly lost it defended really tight by Clark underneath gets it back a shot on target here by Burns has been very very quiet here for a long stretch except for the fouls and thatll be picked off good stop there by Ross 1801 to play in all Virginia he was on the line and so Virginia will take over the basketball here Applause and Reese Speakman to put it in Virginia with it and key hey Clark to bring it up now the Cavaliers have it on their a game all night Virginia only four turnovers in this game NC State was seven turnovers already for a team thats only averaging about six turnovers a game over their last five games hes going with a blow by stop then it pops outside here for Smith Smith on the attack and leaves it in Applause Smiths shooting many people dont recognize how athletic he is until you see him make plays as such extremely athletic hes a big time basketball player give Virginia a lot of credit for what theyve done defending him here tonight and hes as fast as a cup as anybody yes he is Clark on the dish and finished off underneath by Beekman beautiful play by the Cavaliers a great cut by Reese Beekman recognizing his Defender had his head turned going right to the open spot for kieh Clark to be able to find him Beekman with 10 Joyner off the fake kicks out Smith with a long one yes sir a threepointer and that time to quavion Smith actually got to shoot a settle down didnt have to rush his shot to get it off and of course you see how good of a shooter he is when he gets those opportunities can they climb back in this thing doing that well the one thing theyre going to have to do to climb back into this is to get Virginia to turn the basketball over and of course Virginia is at the top of the ACC and fewest turnovers per game so its not in their DNA to give the basketball certainly is a nine a game which is number four in the country for fewest clock to Gardner not this time so is a little window opening up here as Joyner tries to three and just not been his night it has not been his night at all and you got to remember this the First Time jaquel Joyner has played against Virginia the first time hes played in this building foul he was 1603 to go and is that going to be number four on burns on the shove Applause hes been in foul trouble all night long and thats going to put Clark at the line that is his fourth to the big guy Applause and thats a huge foul for DJ Burns youve got to go back to the flagrant foul earlier that gave him foul number three early in this half and you see there just the contact on Kihei Clark under the basket picking up that fourth foul and again with the struggles that NC state has had offensively they truly need DJ Birds on the floor in this game Kevin Keach with no option other than to sit burns with those four fouls still 1603 remaining here in the second half well hes coming off 248 last time out against Georgia Tech two games to go against weight 319 hes playing his best basketball hes playing his best basketball possibly it was his career and youre talking about a young man who was the player of the year at Winthrop a season to go but has been great over the last nine games for NC State Applause Smith wont wait to Triple over the federal touch and thats one thing about when youre guarding to quavion Smith oftentimes you have to just forget about health responsibilities Reese Beekman didnt do anything wrong on that we just wasnt close enough when Smith fought the basketball Smith coming in averaging 19 thats 17 now Gardner lost one up there founder plus going down the lane knocks it out and a whistle on the play hell commit the foul 4430 Virginia with the lead as we head into the timeout if the wolf pack could get back into it theyre going to need a lot more of these Trump taquavion Smith minutes to go here in the second half Dave OBrien and Corey Alexander Ive spent considerable time here in Charlottesville I found your statue the other day on campus Smith averaging 18 and a half hes starting to heat up here when they need it most he absolutely is and hes the guy that will say Hey listen if were not going to be able to do it as a team Ill go do it myself the problem for NC State is can they stop Virginia because they cant continue to trade buckets and theyre already down 14 at this point Smith with eight here in the second half Music Applause join around the dribble shot clock inside 10 and thatll be buried from the corner by Marcel and some of those will help the wolf pack as well Casey Marcel when he gets his opportunity shooting 44 from three second in the ACC from a percentage standpoint if he can get some open looks that can help the wolf back as well all of a sudden NC State making a noise like theyre back in the game Applause better plus up top Franklin theres five 20point games found Applause off Target Applause Music so another opportunity for NC State Applause Smith wants the ball again Marcel along that sideline but he stepped on it and turned it over so that is eight turnovers thats for a team as you mentioned only turn it over 32 times in the last five games in a Notre Dame game all of two ACC record NC State two turnovers in one game and thats unheard of you think about the fact that you only turn it over twice Im not sure I ever played the game where I didnt individually have more than two terms I mean thats just thats a tiny number back door cut Beekman with a slam on a Nifty dish from Kihei Clark and the second time Reese Beekman has be someone back door having a head turn and a smart play by Beekman recognizing wheres the Fenders eyes are and going to the open area and uh for Marcel making his return to the University of Virginia played two years here for Tony Bennett first time back tonight as a member of the wolf pack shot clock to two joyners got to get a shot in the air got a pretty good look actually in the end he absolutely did but Raquel Joyner still scoreless over eight from the field give me open nine at this point and has not been able to get anything going offensively Beekman on the drive hes held up and fouled 1305 to go back to that dunk if P hey Clark just looking after quavion Smith as Reese Beekman goes back door the athletic finish but it was the eyes of Kihei Clark thats a quavion Smith was reading and not recognizing that Bruce Beekman had gone back door where soldiers picked up his third foul I dont think theres anybody in the country whos a better bounce passer than Kihei Clark is okay hes breaking that one down for me over you going and heavy traffic now hes outstanding using the wood like that I would agree he is a unbelievable Pastor has an opportunity to pass John Crotty for alltime assist leader at the University of Virginia I believe the number for karate is 683 however John cloudy did it in four years is there an asterisk attached to the record another whistle here 12 41 to play now the foul will go on Shedrick of the Cavaliers number one on Caden join her in for tequamian smith hell drive it went for the window the slam wont go on underneath gave it up and its taken away by Gardner they want to run Beekman for Clark Shedrick look at him move the ball and a whistle Gardner went for the dunk and hes fouled on the play and that was a 513 there were two NC State players down in the backcourt Virginia had numbers and trying to take advantage of them getting to the freethrow line and Jane Gardner once again where hes been Ultra aggressive on the offensive end of the floor and its paid dividends for the whos Ernest Ross sophomore out of Florida with the personal Garden of the fifth year man over 2200 career points Music Applause coming up nothing but net womens on Thursday at 10 pm on the ACC Network as Gardner finishes off 1222 to go here in the second half and he has 14 Applause 4833 Virginia Applause yes from that corner well Casey Marcel surely is comfortable in this bill and hes shooting the three no question about that and hes been comfortable pretty much all season long we missed his second in the ACC in percentage shooting 44 percent and showing that off here tonight 13 points tonight in his return to Charlottesville Music flank him Franklin with the bounce here for Gardner puts it to the deck and knocked away from him it will be Virginia ball when we come back 1127 left in the contest hes missing to see that he was I thought he was six six I thought he was Michael Jordans size but youre talking about one of the greatest players in ACC history one of the greatest athletes to ever play the game of basketball and for more black history storytelling and coverage stream the black history always collection on ESPN Plus he was the first guy I remember them telling the story he put a quarter up there in the backboard and David would jump up and take it off the other story was put a 20 Bill up there hed make change on the way down he was measured at a 44 inch vertical lead but Ill be the first to tell you I think it was higher than that I saw footage of him going and putting his head way Above the Rim and again you know that doing the testing of a vertical leap was different right a quick feed inside and to finish by Shedrick Lord great ball movement there by the Cavaliers and open it back up to 50 to 36 David Thompson was the first guy one of the first guys I can remember taking off from the foul line to Duncan yeah I can remember the same video once again because of course in 1974 the 197374 season that was the year I was born so of course Im about to turn 50 which means that NC State will be celebrating the 50th anniversary of that next year but I can remember seeing footage of David Thompson in the NBA dunk contest yes and again youre talking about a different level and David Thompson of course was Michael Jordans Idol thats thats who Michael Jordan looked to to model his game after and of course the athleticism which Michael Jordan did have similar to David Thompson but he talked about so much of watching David Thompson throughout his entire career and how he wanted to be like David just think about that you want a scouting report on another player he was Michaels guy there you go thats it right there that says everything Marcelo the leaner line drives it in Boyd tough shot with that twopointer yeah but he is shooting a confident basketball right now Casey Marcel is trying his best to keep NC State in this game the lead now 12 for Virginia but this is the end where NC state has struggled to get stops and without Virginia turning the basketball over they made it difficult for NC State to put up any resistance when Virginia has the basketball its so tough to cut into a lead against Virginia Franklin a determined drive but no once again the Wolfpack getting opportunities to creep a little bit closer they really need Joyner they absolutely do but Virginias done a great job with Joyner not allowing him to get downhill Marcel front of the iron and over the top thatll be a foul against NC State dewana commits the personal 952 to go and we would be remiss if we did not mention the great men its not just good but great minutes that Kane Cedric is giving Tony Bennett and the Virginia Cavaliers after not playing on Saturday did not play coachs decision but did not hang his head didnt pout got back to work and has helped his team build a 12point lead here tonight Applause Clark trying to get past Joyner came back to defend him and a rare turnover for Kihei Clark right now to quavion Smith trying to improve jacquel Joyner to push the basketball get it in his hands Smith with a ugly Miss off the window itll stay on this end it was off Ender plus but that was a rough shot from taquavion Smith he didnt hold his follow through he just threw it up there because and oftentimes when you play against Virginia open looks are so difficult that you rush them when you get them because you know that they dont happen often and that looked like a very rough shot Prince aquavion to Craven Smith all ACC first team in the preseason certainly headed that way 19 points a game also five assists he was a little frustrated there he thought he was open on the inbounds Joyner pull up pop and knocks it down at last his first bucket now Joyner one for 10 from the floor but makes a 10point game with the two and allows NC State to set up their full court pressure McNeely so a 10point game not for a long time it looked like it was going to be a serious Virginia Runaway McNeely with about speed Clark in the paint Shedrick with a leaner and foul into play Marcel did not think so he debates that with Jeffrey Clark but a personal with 8 37 left so thatll be two for Shadrick took a pretty good knock there as he gets to the line where hes 83 percent Music and shooting two here Applause and coming up on Thursday night we have a womens basketball doubleheader coming your way Olivia miles leading number 10 Notre Dame against Pitt at six Eastern and Diamond Johnson over 22 NC State will battle Jewel Speer and Wake Forest should be a great night of womens basketball right here in ACC Network and the ESPN app thank you so its Virginia by 11 but an opportunity here for the wolf pack to get this into single digits which Virginia is held a double figure lead the majority of the first half and all of here in the second half as Joyner tries to get a second bucket unable to come up with it yeah Virginias biggest lead was 20 when it was 40 to 20 Applause and now weve got eight minutes to go Beekman has it Center plus trying to move it downstairs for Franklin Applause swung here for McNeely shot clock down to four back up for Franklins got to get a shot in the air and a high rebound for the wolf pack DJ Burns in foul trouble four getting ready to check back in now for Coach Keats Music Marcel looking to make a move and a whistle Applause and the foul on the play thatll go on Shedrick number three 5140 here Wake Forest knocking off Carolina at home tonight and so many teams contending for those top four seeds in ACC tournament time Smith for Burns and two Applause and so with that basket NC State is within 10 with seven minutes left and thats a hurdle to get over and again thats one of the things Im sure Kevin key just talked to his team about lets just get it under 10 lets get another 10 thatll put some pressure on Virginia see how they respond at that point standard Plus on the bounce and a scrap for the basketball he got it Loose mcneelys three that clangs away Smith and Joyner in that backboard leading the way for the wolf pack one of them has to get real hot here down the stretch Music Marcel for burns out of the double land thrown away picked up by Beekman DJ Burns told me they prepared for the Trap all week but yet they have not handled it very well at all its different to simulating and practice with your guys in comparison to have to do it against the guys who do it for real Gardner taking it in strong off the pump fake got it back and a foul as he gets hit hes pretty Relentless he absolutely isnt recognizing that burns playing with those four fouls he was going to challenge DJ Burns not much DJ Burns could do on that possession cheating partner the 66 grad and to take two with six eleven remaining ACC Unity week tipping on next Saturday Applause Pits on the right side of the bubble played another great game in this one and thats Virginia Tech and five oclock Eastern we have some amazing fans across the ACC this winter ACC Network wanting you to experience each sport from your perspective so snap a pick or take a video you can tag it with hashtag all the devotion post it on your social and you just might see it on acc Network Smith forcing a shot up there takes a foul with 5 51 to go as he got hit on the arm so number two on Reese Speakman Reese Beekman upset with himself for bailing out to quavion Smith I want that wasnt a lot of contact on that shot attempt if they if there was anything it was the right arm down low well its a chance for bacon for everybody if he misses his foul shot the loudest its been all night here the student section trying to get Smith to miss two in a row didnt happen there yeah everyone loves banking so of course its going to get loud when theres bacon on the line but right now an opportunity for first place in the ACC on the line for the who feels like a little more when its Virginia up by 10 because of the way they play and Associates you with turnovers yeah thats the biggest key for Virginia handling the basketball not giving it away only five turnovers for the whos in this game and NC State leads to ACC forcing 14 turnovers a game Virginias handled the basketball to Perfection throughout this game but NC State will continue with the full court pressure to try to find a way to speed Virginia up so theyre trying to test that theory right now as Clark gets it up to Beekman they break it Gardner free well lay it in and Id love to play Bob McNeely not pulling it out and settling making the pass to Gardner getting the quick easy twopoint basket you have to continue to stay aggressive even though the pressures there 18 points for Gardner once again coming up 20 at Virginia Tech in the loss on Saturday hes really become the goto man as this season is worn on a tough play there by Burns but a turnover and Roger is stepping in Oregon and a delay of game warning here against NC State that DJ Burns not throwing the basketball back to Roger Burns just rolling Roger Ayers is rolling it on the floor gets the warning on that one the nephron would be a technical foul break the Press again 5543 and now this is the time for Virginia you used a shot clock its fine but whenever you break the pressure and you have numbers you need to take advantage of it Shedrick Airborne couldnt finish that burns with a rebound Marcel thought about a three he has been a hot hand tonight but they need more than just him Marcel will lift cant stick it rebound tap dot high back to Smith Applause hell launch thats up over the top of the back corner to go back over to Virginia Virginia defensively has made life difficult for taquavion Smith tonight Applause seven of 19 from the field three of ten from Beyond the threepoint Arc for the accs leading scorer and youve got to give Virginias defense especially Reese Beekman Kihei Clark a lot of credit Isaac dealer getting involved in that mix as well for the job theyve done on Smith defensively another big factor Virginia has owned the paints theyve outscored NC State 3012 in the paint tonight and Virginias been outscored in the paint their last two games OB so thats a great sign for the whos coming back home Clark launching in and out from the corner under four to go just two fast break points tonight for the Wolfpack they really live on that on the angle it wont go second effort Marcel yes sir hes a really good threepoint man 18 points for him he absolutely is and that is a new ACC career high for Casey Marcel 17 against Georgia Tech with his previous career high there last time out and he continues to continue playing great basketball for the wolf back four out of eight Beyond a threepoint line foul stops the clock with 3 26 to play and his number four on Casey Marcel and we have a timeout about three and a half left still Virginia 5546 Gardner got started off from the field gray turned his ankle but came back into the game scoring in many different facets on The Fast Break able to finish off with a twohand slam dunk and continues to run the floor and its a beneficiary of a number of great bonds from his teammates its eight Gardner 18 points six of 12 from the field five rebounds and leading Virginia and scoring for the third straight game Im sure NC State would not wish him any ill will physically but they wanted him to sit it out a little longer than he did with that ackel he came back pretty quick he absolutely did and of course Virginias a different team without him on the floor he is their low post scorer off mcgilli got over the cover defensively and blocked the shots and a great job by McNeely because he was late on the rotation but makes up for it with a great block hell have a conversation with Jason Williford the associate head coach for Virginia about being late but you see his effort allows him to be able to come up with a big play all bald there on the block of Gantt going up for the dunk so Beekman at the line after the Gant foul Virginias 17 out of 21 at the foul line on the misfire there by Beekman one of the better foul Shooters here and still three minutes remaining this game is far from over theres more than enough time especially with the threepointer Marcel could not hit it despite an excellent look and it remains a 10point lead and the Cavaliers undoubtedly to run some time off that clock on Gantt Cedric setting the screen Clark never in any hurry on the drive and the layin by Beekman 15 points for Reese bigman backtoback 15point game for Beekman as he continues to get healthy and becomes even more of a contributor on the offensive end of the floor and Caden Cedric contributing defensively that time holding his ground forcing another turnover by DJ burns on the Travel its a Time beginning to run out here on the wolf pack theres season low in points was 60 against Pitts only 46 tonight here at John Paul Jones Arena Beekman on the drive will kick it McNeely buries the three and that feels like a dagger I believe that will be the one Isaac McNeely is giving Virginia great minutes off the bench throughout this game not only offensively but doing the job defensively as well as he continues to develop heres Smith and around and out itll stay right here for NC State with a minute 22 showing and Virginia can start to celebrate it feels like leading 6146 and on the way to denying the wolf pack their 20th win of the Year Smith leans in and whistle and a fouled 118 to go Applause Music so thats on Beekman again the combination of Joyner and Smith you know had led them so many times this season averaging 34 points per game between the two of them theyve been held to 20 tonight well he missed the first one the student section eager for some bacon wont get it there amazing how knowledgeable all these students are and the fans when theres bacon on the line when theres bacon on the line its so true approaching one minutes ago so the Cavaliers with an impressive bounce back after the loss at Virginia Tech absolutely and their defense is back the defense did not travel to Syracuse it did not travel to Blacksburg but here at home it has been right on point Marcel committing the foul to put Shedrick to the line Kaden Shedrick he showed up in a big way particularly in the first half Marcel just fouled out by the way yeah you see these two guys coming together the foul they actually were recruited in the same class came to the University of Virginia together good friends as Casey Marcel gets a mixed Ovation of booze and cheers a young man that is still still very well respected in Charlottesville especially for his contributions throughout two seasons here at Virginia well that had to be emotional returning to the University of Virginia two seasons here this is second year with NC State but the first time hes played here against the Cavaliers on this sport had a very nice night with 18 points he absolutely did it again still friends with many of the players on this team teammates with many of these guys and again you dont lose that Bond even though youre wearing a different uniform Joyner locks it up there and it drops from threepoint territory only the second field goal made for Joyner throughout this game and the crowd not happy about the fact that Kevin Keats called the timeout here down 13 Music Im out there with 391 to go down by 13 but one thing you have to remember Applause NCAA net rankings anything beyond 10 points is a blowout if youre Kevin Keith right now you want this to be a loss under 10 points if they can find a way to get it to nine they will do that as look that completely differently regarding the net rankings under 30 seconds to go and Clark to dribble away a lot of seconds here Cavaliers to put this one into the win column and about to improve to 184 and with their 10th win in the ACC go to ten and three big one went for the slam but came up empty but the final seconds here as Virginia has pulled into a threeway tie for first place in the ACC along with Pitt and Clemson strong performance by Virginias defense holding the accs leading scoring team 30 points under their average Tony Bennett has to be happy with what he got from his team from the defensive standpoint tonight nice moment there Marcel embracing again with
