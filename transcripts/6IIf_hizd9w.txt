He was a mid major coach understanding that thats their only way to make the NCA tournament And for Micah Shrewsbury coming off that fivegame skit challenging his team to play with more grit and more grime for all 40 minutes Its Boston College winning the tip in the road red Notre Dame in the home white Here is Payne Bowden Kapki with a basketball less than 10 to shoot Hit the gamewinning three in the win against Pit earlier this week Meanwhile Notre Dame again switching up its starting lineup Cole Serta Brady Kaylor both starting for just the second time this year in ACC play Shrewberry trying to spread the floor a little bit more with how teams have defended them and particularly Jaden cheering Har Jaylen Harrelson Notre Dame only 15 out of the last 49 from beyond the arc So theyre going to have to step up and knock some in against this ferocious Boston College defense Shrewsberry blocked at the rim as Boston College has done so often this year and cheering Fred Payne pays it off one of the elite shot blocking teams in all of the land And Michael Shrewsbury told his guys today at shoot around were going to have to see a shot fake Somebodys going to have to get this defense up in the air jump into them But you see right there they block shots they take that defense they sprint out and turn into easy offense Carson Tal the Northern Arizona transfer too heavy with the right hand hook Theres only four out of his last 17 from the floor Matt So hes got to finish those in the paint if they have any chance to win Fadeaway jumper from hand is good What a combo that has been in the back court Pain in hand Big reason why theyve won backtoback games When they both play well on the same night they are almost impossible to stop And thats why Coach Grant is so optimistic about the next couple weeks Hes finally got those guys in a rhythm especially with the emergence cheering of paint Boy the defense this year of Jaden Hastings has been something to behold for the Eagles Five to shoot Sort of almost lost it Tout with three Gives it up Harelson cheering and applause Notre Dame out of sorts on its first couple of offensive possessions against a Boston College team that returns just one starter from last year Its hand with a basketball Hes rejected by Kaylor And now here come the Irish They have missed their first four shots Shrewberry crossover step back rims up and was last years most improved player in the conference Led Boston College in scoring catch and shoot three The keys for Boston College in this game theyve got to defend the threepoint line Theyre off to a good start right there And coach Grant told us We have to embrace long possessions against Notre Dame The second and third drive is usually available If you try to attack them on the first possession its going to be a long night Just a miscommunication there between Shrewberry and Kaylor And again this is a Notre Dame team because of the injuries to Marcus Burton out indefinitely and Kevin Theyve had to shuffle not only lineups Jess but roles and theyre still figuring out how this team operates within these new roles and really tough to establish roles when youre playing a ton of freshmen right I mean thats just not modern college basketball So Shrewsbury is sticking with the plan but when you dont have Burke its really difficult to score especially in this league against these tough defenses Fred Payne three Got it And a seven nothing start for Boston College 16 of his 18 games this year in double figures And hes been one of the most improved players not only in the league but in the country Just so fun to watch Plays extremely hard And his stroke has been on fire lately Oh another rejection by Jaden Hastings one of the top shot blockers in the ACC Freddy Payne been on fire Look at the ball movement When Boston College shares music the basketball they are tough to stop And coach Trusbury warned his guys Look Boston College they will put the ball right back in your face Youve got a pump fake or this is whats going to happen to you President Sonia Lovely and the entire student body government screaming Heat Heat Lets go Seven nothing lead for Boston College as we welcome you back to PCEL Pavilion No Marcus Burton for the foreseeable future for Notre Dame He has been out since late November This team started so well seven and three with him in the lineup scoring over 76 points per game That has tapered off substantially Theyve gone just three and six cheering without their leading scoreer and theyve lost five in a row Four by double figures in tal cheering and applause got a timeout for Notre Dame Theyll keep the basketball with three seconds on the timer and we will take the break with them back in 30 seconds from South Ben back in South Ben Matt Schumacher Jess settles with you And Jess not only has Boston College been efficient offensively defensively they have been a buzz Theyre just swarming to the basketball theyre digging the ball handlers out and theyre blocking shots at a rapid pace right here Shrews he needs one of these to fall with one second on the clock Step back three from his son Wont go Rebound tracked down by Ims relocates for three off the back iron An 0 for9 start for Notre Dame Bowden Kappy Twoman game Found Hastings on the cut Two shots coming for the red shirt sophomore from Orlando Playing through Kafki has been very effective for Boston College over the last couple weeks I mean when he touches the ball hes either going to pick and pop and hit a three or hes going to make a good assist But he forces a double team and makes the right decision out of it Well to your point Bowden Khaki has started the last five games for Earl Grant who recruited him out of high school In fact Bowden Kaky made a visit to Boston College The Eagles were one of his top teams He ultimately selected Butler ironically just down the road from Notre Dame When he got in the portal after two seasons at Butler they brought him back to Boston College and hes now playing the role they envisioned for him when he was coming out of high school Earl Grant thrilled to have Boy and was quoted as calling him a stud for the future of Boston College He puts a lot of pressure on your defense when he posts up because not only can he score he can pass out of it And by the way he can step out and hit threes Hes three out of his last five And hes been clutch down the stretch with the gamewinner against Pit the last time out That was fantastic Shrewberry knifing and finally gets the first bucket of the game for Notre Dame over five minutes in I think he has to be more aggressive I mean hes the leading threepoint shooter in the ACC but look youve got to hunt more shots He only took five shots the last game Matt and thats just not near enough for this team Hastings extra pass tames a three and hits That is why hes in the starting lineup hitting from over 40 Its amazing when you watch the tape on Boston College how much better and more unselfish they are over the last few games compared to earlier in the season The extra pass is leading to open looks Sundra cheering knocked down a couple against North Carolina in the loss last week Hand left open Catch and shoot Rebound top Here comes Logan IS whos playing way more minutes than they anticipated him playing this year In large part due to the injury to Marcus Burton Shrewberry floater off the window is good There you go More shot attempts coming out of the last timeout by Micah Shrewberry Absolutely Hes got to forget about the stat sheet and only think about winning And the more he shoots the better this team is Khaki corner three opportunity Taves is two for two Just poor defense there by Shrewberry You cannot help off of a shooter thats on fire like that That same side no help is written into their rules defensively and he just fell asleep Shrewberry short on the three Line change coming from each team Well Shrewsbury he got the message Hes got to be more aggressive Great dribble handoff the one foot kiss music off the glass Thats very impressive But at the other end it was a little late on the threepoint shooter and number 10 made him pay Chase Forte the South Dakota transfer now running the point for Boston College First minute to the night for him Aiden Shaw snorts into the game as well for the Eagles Heres Caleb Stagger Freshman shot off the mark Cole Cerna back the other way Just another great play by Kky though to skip it to the corner off that double Its a pretty high percentage look Kapi is just playing his best basketball of his career Theyre going to keep letting him touch it I had more space to shoot that than he thought Bounces down and out Less than 10 to shoot Tried to thread it down the cow He couldnt but a foul underneath will go against the freshman rider Frost This is what theyre going to continue to do Matt Just pound the ball inside You got a pretty cheap whistle there but keep your eye on 33 for Bos College Hes going to touch it a lot tonight Nice shot by Fred Payne on the curl down He has seven of Boston Colleges 16 cheering cheering And we welcome those of you joining us from Dallas Texas Its a thrilling win for SMU hanging on after leading by as many as 16 cheering Matt Schumacher the former Iowa Hawkeye just settles with you from PCEL Pavilion where Boston College has gotten out to a nice lead They lead it 187 Start at 8 zip Frost to three and hits Notre Dame began the game 0 for8 They cheering have found some better consistency on that end of the floor Thats a phenomenal shot in transition Boston Colleges defense has been elite Theyre blocking shots Theyre getting steals and getting out and running So dont let them set up Score in transition Phenomenal decision Here they go Look if the defense gets set up just kick it for an open three They needed that one spirit of walk We wanted to highlight the many outside that assist in building the beloved community The sister for moment center is located in the heart of campus on the second floor of the womens movement center Following sisters see a moments example The centers team aims to create a space for dialogue and reflection social celebration and support rooted in dignity and belonging Joining us tonight are representatives from the centers main units the gender relations center multicultural student programs and services and the office of student enrichment Irish fans GIVE IT UP FOR THE STAFF OF the sister Thea Bowman Center cheering applause Heat Heat My side Heat Heat Heat Heat Back from South Bend Indiana where Boston College leads by eight They began the game on an 80 run Notre Dame missing its first eight shots Some of those were blocked Great defense to start by the Eagles And Fred Payne just settles as he has all ACC play A redot start Nine points on four of four Well hes 17 out of his last 31 from beyond the arc So he has been exceptional One of the best guards in the country in conference play especially So theyve had no answer for him Micah Shrewsbury told his guys said We have two keys to this game He said We we cant go we cant get our shots blocked every time Somebodys going to have to pump fake and power And he said We have to stay in front of Payne and hand We got to stay in the gaps So far nobodys had an answer for Fred Payne You know hes going to light you up Theres nothing you can do about it Sir Mohamd short rebound effort Bowden Kapkey and he wins it back for Boston College Eagles have won backto back games An overtime win against Syracuse and a threepoint victory on a gamewinning shot by Kafky against Pit earlier this past week Theyve been passing the ball extremely well over the last couple games making the extra pass And in this game its the second or third drive that usually breaks down Notre Dame Theres a perfect example of he just turned the ball over Jump ball arrow to the Fighting Irish Coach Grant told his team Weve got to defend Notre Dames three Its the second drive He said That gets us into the paint Here it is Good little hesitation He just lost the ball Thats a stop Notre Dame needed Three turnovers in the last 90 seconds for BC Notre Dame started 0 for8 Theyve since gone four for seven cheering with two threes and an offensive foul will give it back to BC Thats number two on Ryder Frost Its a Notre Dame team that of course is without Marcus Burton for the foreseeable future still a possibility that he will come back this year One of the top scorers in the ACC Theyre also without Kevin Jai a veteran post presence for the rest of the year Lot of underassman getting significant minutes now for the Irish Payne lost it last touch by Notre Dame Itll stay here with 13 Notre Dames best offense in this game has been attacking early in transition one or two passes If Boston Colleges D gets set up its been tough to come up with buckets Fred Pay still perfect He has 12 on five of five What a brilliant play You draw two to the ball Forte has two guys on him Snaps it over to the wing And this guys been incredible cheering Notre Dame with a response Their lone conference win against Stanford Have lost four straight games by double figures And Micah Shrewsbury told us he felt like they played well for stretches at North Carolina but couldnt sustain for the full 40 minutes Thats the key against a surging Boston College team tonight at home And they practiced desperate today didnt they They they put in a long morning They worked on a lot of fundamentals staying in the gap So they know how important this opportunity is at home They cant lose six in a row in this league So hes got a young banged up team but you still have to step out and get it done Paynes first miss And here come the Irish Jaylen Harelson their leading scoreer just two points on one of three to start And a whistle on Chase Forte of Boston College Well the latest in Were number one documentary series chronicles the 1993 national championship winning North Carolina mens team music led by Dean Smith Youll get never before seen footage and interviews with players and coaches available now on the ESPN app Carolina got a big win today against Virginia trailed by double digits and hung on against a Virginia team that will be coming to town here in the coming days Much improved Virginia Cavaliers team They will run you out of the gym right Thats just a huge North Carolina Yes it is That one felt like a game North Carolina needed to have It did Taves back into the game for BC He has two threes so far in the half Skip pass three is there and off the back iron from the freshman Steager Heres Braden Shrewberry back into the game Hit a couple of jumpers early and he traveled cheering 2112 lead for BC shooting 50 from the floor on the road on this Saturday night in the ACC Irish you know the only time I tell you to put the news down is when its time for the pops to go up Please welcome your Hey there Ready Quick quick You ladies are up one more time for your snorts Welcome back to Southbend where Fred Payne has 12 points on five of six Hes such a fierce competitor and when he gets his game going hes unstoppable Theyre using him in goat screens like you see right there on the screen The defense falls for it He steps out Five of six from the music floor two of three from beyond the arc and his coaching staff is so thrilled Donald Han struggled earlier in the season and so Fred had to pick up his game and once he started seeing shots go in became one of the better guards in the league cheering Offensive foul on Boston College will give it back to Notre Dame Thats number one on the freshman Caleb Stiger To your point Earl Grant told us Fred Payne has been a pleasant surprise this year Always knew he was talented Jess didnt know he could do this night in and night out Give you 20 against some of the top teams in the country in this league Just didnt realize he was such a lethal scorer Got to find a way to get Shrewsbury involved in this game again He a couple quick early shots but hasnt shot much since Kaylor Long on the three Here comes Taves Stagger steps into one Offensive rebound tapped into the hands of Han and the Eagles reset with 15 to shoot Thats the first rush shot theyve taken all game but that was the right shot Stiggers in the game and on scholarship to hit threes The double down low Tout comes away with it and its last touch by BC Boy I dont know about that one This might be challenged Earl Grant look looking back at his bench as they take a peek at the iPad His players are pleading with him to challenge it and they are going to certainly looked initially live like it was last touch by Tal of Notre Dame I tell you what that support staff and assistant coaches they got to be on it dont they with that video just to make sure I mean you got a few seconds to make that four Notre Dame ball timeout Boston College to challenge that ruling Ill tell you what Jess the last job I want on the bench in college basketball now is holding the iPad because if you challenge and you dont get the challenge successfully you lose your only challenge of the game and you lose a timeout Theres a lot of risk when you need those late especially in that last couple minutes It looks like hes going to win that challenge but well almost right away Jaden Hastings who was the one tied up with Tal after the call on the floor was made in favor of Notre Dame looked right to the Boston College bench and made that universal signal to his coaching staff to make a review Its been interesting in the last couple of minutes of these conference games and so many of them come down to the wire when teams like you said dont have one and then the call goes against them and you know plays a big role in the outcome of these games So youre right that is a tough job and you better be on top of it Our officiating crew AJ Desai Evan Burrows Jeff Pawn Boston College such an improved team So much more unselfish Got to give Donald Han a lot of credit for that as well I mean so build up before the season Even got a vote for player of the year but hes humbled himself made the extra pass More about winning now And Payne has stepped up Kapki theyve been a lot more fun to watch and its paying dividends in the win loss column It appears we have a ruling here AJ Desai going over to the inhouse PA Here we go After review Boston College challenge is successful Itll be their ball on the baseline with 20 seconds on the shot clock They will retain their timeout They have one challenge remaining for the game Well to your point the fan base too has noticed In fact last week they had a home game against Syracuse and Earl Grant remarked it was the best environment he has been part of since taking the job five years ago Felt like an old Big East game he said in his postgame press conference I covered him three times last year and the ball just stuck Guys were dribbling the air out of it This team is moving just even on this possession Balls going side to side Everybodys touching it They got great spacing Hastings great back door feed to the freaky athletic Aiden Shaw transferring in from Missouri and its 2312 Boston College These guys just trust each other They know if they get open theyre going to get it back Boy Shaw can get up there Can he Just lives above the rim Looks like he got a 49 in bird Getting close to Jess Settles heights laughter Thats a nice step through by Harelson and a goend Theyll count the bucket Just his second made basket as we get a look at that other dunk on the other end of the floor Well just the ball movement right You got the high ball screen Theres the slip Doesnt try to conquer the defense Whos open No dribbles You cut to the basket with integrity and you get the easy bucket 49 in vertical Thats four feet I mean weve seen it on tape Theyre not exaggerating Double on Hastings open three hand Thats what Notre Dame wanted to do You talked about all the teaching today in their shoot around A lot of it was defensive focused Wanted to force Boston College into contested threes Good inside feed Harelson And thats backto back buckets for the freshman Theres the first pump fake weve seen all afternoon And you pump fake with authority The defense cant stay on their feet Need to go right through them Hand way off Harelson snatches the board Hand behind the play Numbers for Notre Dame Kick out three Ball tapped around Payne up ahead to hand and he finishes I tell you whenever Harelson gets two feet in the paint and Notre Dame doesnt score theres no one getting back And so Boston College one outlet pass Thats got to be three or four easy baskets in transition for them in this first half Shrewberry save that Looked like that was headed out of bounds Hes had a nice start to the game Six points on three of six cheering And a whistle on Harelson That is number one on the freshman Fourth on Notre Dame Micah Shrewsbury Bradens father told us I need to do a better job of getting the ball in his hands not necessarily just in places where he can score but in places where he can playmake Theyve done that so far with him in the first half Absolutely I mean hes played a tremendous floor game He attacks when its open and hes trying to set up teammates Theyve had some pretty open looks from three They just havent been following Notre Dame just two for nine from downtown to start Less than five minutes to go in the opening half Boston College on top 2518 Payne a three Short Good rebound effort and Boston College will reset Notre Dame wanted to travel on Khaki Heres Shaw Look at the shot clock Taves with 10 Fadeaway jumper Baseline is pure for Taves Harrison goes right past Rodunovich and all of a sudden eight points for Harelson Shaw spins cheering tap out Serta Shrewberry forcing the issue Draws a foul Notre Dame will shoot their first free throws of the night when we

on the ACC Network Headlined by the Tarheelss of North Carolina who erased a 16point deficit today on the road at Virginia thanks to music 20 points by Caleb Wilson Kesi Reeves Jr will look to try to slow down Clemson who won 7763 today but Reeves had 19 in that game This music league just seems deeper than it was last year from top to bottom Georgia Tech you can throw in that conversation Heck Florida State We saw them leading up to our game here tonight on ACCNet give SMU all it could handle forcing that to be a lot tighter than it probably should have been SMU at one point had a double digit lead in the second half Meanwhile our game is as tight as it has been since the opening minutes Boston College led 8 nothing to start Notre Dame has just slowly chipped away and theyve gotten more stout defensively And Munovich cannot save it for Boston College Back to Notre Dame who trailed by as many as 11 at one point in this half Irish trying to snap a fivegame skid You said it earlier Jeff Settles It feels must win here in South Bend and amongst the program Yeah it really does I mean the coaching staff a little on edge today A lot of drill work Really focused I mean obviously as a player you take a lot of pride in protecting the home court Theyve got to knock down some open threes Sundra Short tames the rebound Notre Dame now just two for 10 from beyond the arc Theyre really in a shooting slump Only 15 of their last 49 coming into this one So a team thats beat up and with a young front line theyve got to knock in the ones that theyre wide open That was down and out for Hastings Shrewberry kick out I a three Boston College looking for their first road ACC win since 2024 at Louisville They have lost 13 in a row on the road in league play And an offensive foul will give it back to the Irish IMS is doing a solid job the last four or five possessions on Fred Payne Theyre running a lot of actions for Payne Theyre using him as a screener as a decoy but IMS is not falling for it And its discombobulated the rest of the guys So thats what individual defense will do for you It just messes up the offense Thats really become his role Logan Ims a defensive tone setter this year on a team that has been injury battled and roll shuffling crossed off the side of the rim Payne with a rebound trailing behind the play comes Ham Micah Shrewsbury can live with those shots but theyre not even close right Those are just coming up short Again if you continue to play through 33 good things are going to happen if youre an Eagles fan First point of the night for Kapky He does have four rebounds and a pair of assists That is the 16 foul on BC First on Hastings Well Kafkys been in a groove music at both ends of the floor And he gets no double team right Because if you send the double hes going to kick it out for the open three like he did the first 18 minutes of this game You play him single coverage going to lower that shoulder go right over the top You talk about a guy whos playing with a tremendous amount of skill and confidence over the last three or four In his two seasons at Butler he was never a focal point offensively Thats what hes become at BC this year Not just scoring but playmaking Sir Mohamd around and out And a foul to boot on Notre Dame their fifth Gives it back to BC You get inside Theres the spin Nowhere to go You see you just hear footsteps right They block five shots per game They came out early in this game were swatting everything And you get a little nervous when you get that deep and the ones youre supposed to finish Its almost like a block cheering Taves a three He has hit three in a row to start the game Well you got the pin down action on one side You reverse the ball Fred Payne one of the elite shooters in the country lately decides to pass up a good shot for a great shot Shrewberry Nice floater in the lane is good He has 10 Stops a twominute scoring job for Notre Dame Payne almost lost it Shrewberry last touched it Itll stay here with 22 to shoot And less than 60 seconds to go in the opening half Shrewsbury is a phenomenal player right Just very slippery with the basketball A little head fake a little push off Shot puts it over the front of the rim These Notre Dame guys look you watch the tape theyve been complaining a little too much about the officiating Not in this game They just taking the hits making plays Its what theyve got to do to get better Timeout Boston College Theyre use it or lose it Well Womens Hoops music takes over the network every Sunday Monster game between Pit and Duke One of two remaining unbeatens The others music Louisville who won by 30 against the Boston College womens team who had to drive music four hours today from Louisville to South Ben so they could catch the double team charter back home after the mens game tonight in South Bend because of all the impending weather which no matter where youre watching this game from youre probably dealing with some of already on this Saturday night in January just plain trains and automobiles I just said any any way to get home Youre going to be sitting by the fireplace about midnight tonight and Indianapolis I got to get back to Iowa Who knows when Ill ever get back there but uh it is really cold Yeah Thank you I I remember sitting in Lou Holmess office when I was a senior in high school when he told me the the famous joke around here that the the fathers who founded Notre Dame said theyd leave when the weather improves and were still here right Digger Phelps who we just saw on the screen can get down with that He still lives in the same house in South Bend in which he lived in when he was coaching here which included a trip to the Final Four in 1978 The legends never leave Right Right They got videos of him They got banners I Id come to There he is Theres coach with a phenomenal career at ESPN after the coaching game shared a funny moment with him earlier Told him I was a fan of his He said Why I said Because you always colorcoordinated your highlighters and your ties His hand coordinates on that three And Boston College surges the lead back to 11 Only you would know about the matching highlighter and the tie He tried to grab my headset You almost worked the game with him Stuck out to me watching Digger Phelps Oh Digger Shot clock turned off to end the half Notre Dame down 11 Harelson with the basketball Five to go Harelson step back off the front of the rim Rebound tout Shrewsbury at the horn And the largest deficit of the game for Notre Dame They take it into the halftime locker room College twice led by 11 They started the game on an 80 run Midway through that first half Notre Dame chipped away got it to four but just not enough sustained offense to get Notre Dame over the hump They have lost five in a row including four by double figures trying to get back on the right side with still a lot of basketball to play before the ACC tournament Theyre going to have to hit six to eight threes in this second half to have any chance of winning this game Theyre two out of 13 from beyond the arc and a lot of those are wide open Theres the first look again You just cant buy one from beyond the ark The 24 first half points for Notre Dame Second fewest in a half this year beating only the Stanford game which they ironically won Its their lonely law begging lone league win of the season at this point And we hate to harp on Burton not being here but its a reality Yep The numbers show it Marcus Burton has been out since late November Their leading scoreer one of the top guards in the country There is a possibility of him returning though the time table uncertain at the moment Good effort by Notre Dame there Brady Kaylor getting it up to Shrewsbury now wearing number 40 His 11 jersey was ripped Traded it out at the half Kaylor might have traveled a little bit gimpy after getting tangled up Shrewberry now with 12 points He is so lethal with that little shimmy and that floater I mean you could tell hes worked on that his entire life But that is a low percentage shot for most guards He makes it look easy Maybe not a coachs kid Might be a high percentage shot for a coachs kid Another good rebound by Kaylor Harelson had six points in the first half Notre Dames leading scorer tout Right place right time The put back is good for the Northern Arizona grad transfer Well theres nothing new under the sun for big number 33 led the country last year in rebounding Gets in there shoves everybody around He struggled to score over the last couple games That was a much needed bucket Hand tried to force the issue Lot of contact No call Back the other way The Irish Harelson into the teeth Was rejected but fouled and he will go to the free throw line A place where neither team spent much time at all in the first half When you take a bad shot at one end you usually pay the price at the other end And he obviously gets hit in the head And when Donald Han watches this tape those are the types of plays he doesnt need to make anymore right You got to move it on Well tonight at 10 Eastern after our mens basketball quintuple header right here on ACC Network and ESPN music at the Nothing But Net Crew will break down the day in the ACC with highlights and analysis of every mens game and look ahead to the best matchups on the docket this week Two misses at the line for Harelson Here comes hand And to your point sort of the message we got from Earl Grant today at the shootound You dont have to come back and score 20 this year just because you led the team in scoring last year More pieces around him this season Jess Absolutely And weve seen it this entire game Ive seen two bad shots so far by Boston College which is just amazing I mean they take 10 and a half last year when I watched him So hes got to really discipline himself move the ball on Hes such an explosive athlete with an elite midrange game but one of these has to fall for another game Spot on three Shrewberry with 15 to lead all Irish scores Theyre a much better threepoint shooting team and what theyve shown lately cheering 70 Notre Dame run over the last 2 and 12 minutes Kapi traveled cheering applause and thats the seventh turnover on BC Well Shrewsbury knows his value to this team and I I guarantee you there was some video watch with the head coach over the last couple days Hey if you only take five shots we cant win And hes answered the call Look at the rotation the follow through Hes been special He had 21 in an ACC game earlier this season but just 22 combined over the last four games on 32 shooting A concerted effort to get him the ball in areas where he can score tonight Step back from Shrewberry Tout another offensive rebound Kaylor left open Hits the reload and Notre Dame has cut to three 10 run for the Irish And a timeout taken by Earl Graham cheering They have come out looking like a different team 102 out of the halftime locker room

Couldnt get it to go Zipp back to Capki and a foul on Kaylor What a pass by Jaden Hastings And thats the second foul on Kaylor Well they came out of the timeout You knew they were going to Capy on the post He comes up a little bit short but theres just the hustle play And we talked about that extra pass all afternoon They are so good right now of Sharing the Rock and we got to step up break this drought with some easy free throws cheering Just the second trip to the line today for BC They are not a particularly good free throw shooting team In fact theyre last in the ACC at 66 Notre Dame very close to them right around 69 And those are the first points in nearly four minutes for the Eagles Less than 10 to shoot Harrelson drives on the smaller hand and uses his physicality The freshman Harelson with eight Shoots 67 from the floor 5 ft in So when he gets it that deep its pretty much lights out cheering Have not seen Taves shoot the ball so far in the second half He was four for four in the first with three threes And a kick ball on Notre Dame will keep it here by Garrett Sundra into the ball game for a Notre Dame team that is rolling heavily with freshman and sophomores Three of them on the floor right now Hand catch and shoot Draws a foul And thats a threepoint shooting foul to boot on Harelson Thats number two on the freshman So Jaden Hastings number 22 Look at this dribble handoff He is so versatile He frees up his teammate Thats what gives him the open three and they collapse late fouling But Hastings has 32 blocks on the year But he can cover on the perimeter He can set screens He can run double handoffs Its been really impressive to watch courtside his versatility And theres those free throws you were talking about Matt cuz this games close and that plays a major factor cheering Hand last year led BC in scoring nearly 16 points per game and six rebounds Not only was he the most improved player in the conference but he was honorable mention all ACC Came back this year pressed a little bit early in the words of his head coach Earl Grant cheering but over the last couple of games has seemingly figured out his role to make winning plays and thats really the key when you talk to Earl Grant Now was there a lane violation here on Notre Dame There was and it was on Carson Tout He is pleading his case with Evan Burroughs who is having none of it Yeah right there Two of the cardinal sins in basketball Fouling a threepoint shooter and having a lane violation take away a bucket It happens within a few seconds of each other Tell you what though there is quite a hitch in the free throw shot of hand Thats right That might even fake out the great Jess settles You got to know the scouter report Blocking foul underneath and it does go against hand That is the first on the red shirt junior from Virginia Beach Great job by Michael Shrewsbury keeping his team confident in that first half when they were missing those open threes He would clap his hands say Keep shooting fellas And its led to success cheering at this end What an out of bounds play by the mind of Micah cheering probably doesnt get the credit he deserves for being a great coach not only player development wise but Axs and Os What a boom to the basket there by Hand with the finish And now Hand in double figures with 11 And thats just a silly foul on Hastings Now the third on BCs lead shot blocker This is what this guy does right He just attacks Hes relentless He only knows one speed and those are the plays he has to make But I covered Micah Shrewsbury at Penn State I used to say it was the mind of Micah because hes one of those guys who has the gift to be able to adjust within the game and to attack defensive players who he thinks are weaker than his offensive players I mean Bill Self is the best in the game about making ingame adjustments Michael Shrewberry has that skill set Right now hes just got a really young team and hes got an injured team but hes drawing up the right stuff over the last couple minutes Braden Shrewsbury his son with 17 points on 50 from the floor One of the best nights that Braden Shrewberry has had at least in ACC play during a league season high Heres Taves and that rims out still looking for his first points of the second half I think 33 captain needs to touch the ball in the post the next time down for Boston College Great feed Sundra back door Harelson pays it off underneath and the star freshman with 10 Here come the Irish down one Lowest deficit of the game cheering cheering Payne behind the back step back rims out Notre Dame with a chance to take its first lead and theyre going to blow the whistle on Fred Payne That is number one on the BC leading score but the fourth already on the Eagles Well heres Fred up top and he gets all tangled up Just kind of a couple of guys asking each other about the weather A little tussle laughter You going to make it home tonight Are you cold Yeah me too This is terrible Is thereus Yeah thats a play on This is the ACC Matt Theres Sir Mohamd pounding the rock Kick out cheering and Payne was pushed by Notre Dame And then a tangle up and the foul will go against ND That is number three on Brady Kaylor Well another open three And keep your eye on Fred down here Two guys just going for the ball And just two guys hustling Freds got to be careful though right He He doesnt need the Hes playing with a fiery competitiveness right now right Just lead this team Stay in the game Stay focused Here he is with the basketball Lobbing it into Capki Double comes immediately Extra pass Five to shoot Forte Long three Capy Tap out secured by Ims Here comes Mohamed Oh that is great defense by Notre Dame And a hold on BC cheering and applause This is the type of energy that Micah Shrewberry wanted to see from Notre Dame Grit grime and highf flying around the boards Irish fans please welcome to the court your name cheer leaders as they lead you in go Irish cheering cheering One more time cheering now Get on your feet and make some noise Let me hear you cheering Heat Heat cheering cheering Heat Heat cheering cheering I said I said snorts Notre Dame trailed by as many as 11 in this game and then Micah Shrewberry caught fire Just settles Well its been the runners the kisses off the glass the hesitations the ball handling skills the little shot moves in the paint Hes just been outstanding Hes only one out of seven from three So look for him to hit a couple of those big late Hes got his team back in it This is the aggressiveness and the passion hes got to play with going forward Started the game wearing his usual number 11 Went to the half it was ripped Changed it Now hes wearing the nameless number 40 Performance hasnt dipped one bit Thats right 17 for Shrewberry to lead all scorers tonight And that ball going back to BC But Notre Dame playing with some desperation tonight You can feel it I can feel it And certainly that was the overwhelming sentiment at their shootound earlier this morning Capi the double faked left it short Rebound Sundra Notre Dame seeking its first lead of the night Well coach Earl Grant told his guys to embrace longer possessions They were shooting the ball a little too quickly in this second half Lets see if the next time down they can use the entire shot clock get to the paint with a pass or a dribble late try to break down this Irish defense Kaylor cheering left hand wont go Got his own miss Serta three Notre Dame leads cheering cheering Open three Boston College gets their first of the second half on a stinger bank Open late night in South Bend Before that made shot they were 0 for five from three in the second half and two for 10 from the floor Off the bounce the move was there and he caught a foul on BC Now whos it on Cole Sera Hes come in on fire Seven out of his last 20 shooting close to 40 Boy that is really deep Look at the arch he puts on that And at the other end look when youre slumping you just need a little bit of luck or I should I say answered prayer I mean that was an impossible angle And just smashes it in off the glass The foul by the way was on Aiden Shaw Looked like for a moment they could have gotten Hastings which would have been devastating for BC He already has three and he is their leading rim protector Tied at 46 First time we have been tied tonight at the under 10 mark of the second half Boston College looking for its third consecutive win in league play for the first time since 2015 Rather for the second time since 2015 Stinger again Harelson on Steager Well thats his grown man strength by the freshman Ill tell you what I mean this kid has lived in the weight room with one of the great training programs in the country and you you can see just the power he had on that move I mean this is just what he does right He plays bully ball weight room ball Everybody knows what hes going to do Hes not going to shoot it Just pounds the air out of it The crab dribbles the little hesitation and just no answer You mentioned being under the toutelage of one of the great strength coaches in the country John Sanderson was kind enough to sit down with us at length during Notre Dame shoot around I mean he did legendary stuff under coach Beheim at Michigan regularly turning above 70 string bean guys into 220 rocked up Big 10 basketball players Trying to do the same this year at Notre Dame Most people in our business think hes the number one strength coach in the country I mean hes just proven it everywhere hes been How about this When he was at Michigan Michigan went to a sweet 16 or farther including two Final Four in seven out of his nine years So it just just amazing to see what hes done already for these freshmen here at Notre Dame And dont you think because theyre not quote unquote on staff people forget how much of an impact strength coaches have on the longevity of a team season particularly in basketball where youre playing late into March and if youre lucky in early April Youre exactly right It just used to be a football thing right Power and strength and agility Now its a basketball thing Guys like him have taken it to another level What separates him from so many trainers He played in the final four himself as an Ohio State Buckeye so he understands the perspective from a player standpoint and a training standpoint Harelson 360 and the left hand scoop is good in his bag in the second half He is 14 on seven of 10 Off the bounce Forte took the bump from Serta and the reigning Summit League defensive player of the year Well get two shots when we come back Well Jaylens just taking this game over right Its Groundhog Day You know what hes going to do Nothing music you can do about it Not Tames on top Now fans make sure Keep following the directions with your LE phone 6 presented by Verizon IN THE DIRECTIONS OF THE VIDEO BOARD READY UP DOWN RIGHT LEFT Keep it going Hey Big Saturday next week on the ACC Network Pit at Clemson The Tigers surging Meanwhile North music Carolina back on the right side of things with a 16point comeback today on the road against Virginia They will be at Georgia Tech Those two matchups headlining a big day of hoops next Saturday Meanwhile back here at PCEL Pavilion Notre Dame trailed by 11 at the half Did not lead in this game until the 1040 mark of the second half Brighton Shrewsbury a big reason for this comeback to this point 17 points on seven of 15 cheering Chase Forte at the line after the third foul on Cole Soda before the break cheering And itll be interesting to see how the free throw line plays out down the stretch Neither team strong at the line this year In fact Boston College the worst in the ACC to this point at 66 Offensive foul And Micah Shrewsbury does not agree Well look its such a problem to be a fiveman in college basketball these days right You have to sprint down the court guard threepoint shooters and then at this end of the court if you set just a if you make a little movement they get you for an offensive foul 30 ft from the basket So I agree with Shbury there Thats a let it play on Just a little love tap there and he rolls to the basket They get him with the moving screen Neither team got into the bonus in the first half Both are in the bonus the rest of the game with each successive foul Taves kick out hand barreling into the paint Lost the ball Sundra up ahead to Harelson Serta tout rebound and thats a foul on Katy underneath and there might be some extra here Aiden Shaw got tangled up with Carson Tal after the foul on Kky his third Notre Dame might be shooting free throws here Look at Todd underneath He gets inside position This is an elite offensive rebound Tries to dunk it Well I dont know There was a little bit both ways there Kind of yells gets in his face Oh and he flops right there Not very aggressive to put it lightly by Aiden Shaw I mean its going to take a lot stronger of a push to put T on the ground right there let me tell you at 68 250 I mean this this guy can go across the street here that up and laughter effective He is strong So they have gone to the monitor for an official review to see if anything should be upgraded Here we will get another look at the replays and these are what they are seeing at the monitor Well first of all its just a phenomenal offensive rebound I mean just look at the footwork Guy gets inside there goes up with two hands They blow the whistle on the floor He goes up after the whistle and acting class is in session on a Saturday in South Bend cheering Earl Grant is laughing at midcourt Our officiating crew AJ Desai Evan Burrows Jeff Pawn have gotten together at midcourt to figure out how to adjudicate all of this The simplest answer might just be play on There is nothing Just the common foul on the floor on Bowden Kapki Tout doing a little officiating as well He throws the technical foul onto Boston College Theres obviously a dead ball So theyve got to decide whether they want to penalize one of these guys for this shenanigans or not cheering and applause which boy in a tight game where there wasnt a whole lot there I hope not Here we go After review there was a common foul by Boston College number 33 Notre Dame number 33 will shoot one and one After that we have a dead ball Contact technical foul on Boston College number 23 Anyone will shoot for Notre Dame Two shots Itll be Notre Dames ball on the baseline 20 seconds on the shot clock Boy I dont know In a competitive game like this which has been called rather tightly I might add in the second half compared to the first half where neither team reached the bonus seems like a hefty cheering penalty but nonetheless Notre Dame will take advantage of it And Carson Tal sold it to his credit I I I dont like it at all If Im an Eagles fan Im really upset right now by that Its a common foul Play on Got a competitive game And the bank is definitely open How can you not love Carson Tals energy Are you not entertained This is like some Dennis Rodman theatrics going on right here Wow Well 703 to go Remember this moment Yes because this the largest lead of the night for Notre Dame And this is a huge swing because they will get four free throws and the basketball cheering Harelson the inbounder finds Serta trying to draw contact wont get the call and comes away with it with numbers cheering Taves with the basketball Had 11 in the first half He shot it just once in the second No points for one of the top sharp shooters in the conference in this half Thought about it there 10 to shoot Taves out to paint Sunder the tap and the last touch Itll stay here with 20 to shoot Notre Dames defense in this second half has been much improved Now Boston College is running some sneaky actions against them Some Iverson cuts some flares some pick and rolls But Notre Dames been able to rotate and force tough shots They have forced Boston College to shoot 20 less from the floor in the second half Hand slips it inside Shaw back out Payne Thats a three Left it off the side of the rim And Tal in double figures in rebounding for the 12th time this year And a whistle on Boston College Back to the line go the Irish Second foul on Luca Taves Well this feels like a very important stretch of the game between now and the under four immediate timeout for BC All the momentum has seemingly shifted to Notre Dame And it almost feels Jess like BCs a little bit rattled emotionally here getting caught up in some of the theatrics and the gamesmanship of this highly competitive rivalry Well lets see if Kapki can touch it on the post and they can play inside out At least let him have a touch Right now Notre Dames defense is stopping this initial surge BC on the wrong end of an 186 run Double on Kapki Hand trying to wiggle to the basket and he does Thats what they need to do Play inside out Great pass I thought Han got fouled twice on that play No whistling but he still powered through it 13 points for Han Fivepoint Notre Dame lead after the Irish trailed by 11 at the half Got to back off a little bit on this guy You know what hes going to do cheering Carlson off the mark Sundra the offensive rebound really stacking in Notre Dames favor Their ninth of the game Excuse me Parker Try to make Jaylen hit a jump shot Roll to the basket for Tout and he puts it in for two What a night he has had Six points 11 boards two assists the emotional and vocal leader of this youthful Irish team Taves probing fadeaway missed everything and he hears it from the fans at PCEL Pavilion Hang on a second Theyre going to say the ball last touched Notre Dame This might get reviewed Theres that double kick out Theres hand goes up draws some contact and finishes it Notre Dames entire staff 15 ft out on the court wondering what just happened So instead they said it was a foul on Garrett Sundra and Shaw makes the front end of the one and one Theyre going to force the air ball Theres Sunja trying to box out Shaw Boy I didnt see a whole lot there Shaw makes them both Big free throws And now Jaden Hastings one of the elite rim protectors in the conference back into the game playing with three fouls as is Bowden Khaki Both teams in the bonus the rest of the way both with at least two timeouts in a fivepoint game with 415 to go Tout kick out Sundra extra pass Serta off the mark with a three TOUT SKYING for the board and draws a foul and thats number four on Hastings Well you just wont see a better offensive rebound than big number 33 Look at this snatch I mean just ferocious around the rim takes the hit Is he going to step up and bank two more of them in emotionally turn the tide to this second half Theres no question He is the do it all energy giver Look at laughter the do it all energy giver of this team has really embraced the role of doing the dirty work All while playing to the crowd as much as possible Pure entertainment This guy is tough physical Wow Yeah those were two big misses there though Neither team has been very strong at the line particularly in league play And speaking of the foul line that is where Hastings is headed when we come back Fivepoint lead for Notre Dame They have erased an 11point deficit trying to snap a fivegame skid Heat Heat Heat Heat Heat Heat Irish fans were outside Were trying to show Austin College how were selling WE NEED THE home to finish So I brought out the decimal meter Make some noise cheering cheering cheering I cant hear you Welcome back to Southbend Indiana where Notre Dame is plus 16 in the second half Matt Schumacher just settles and down the stretch the Irish have totally flipped this game erasing an 11point halftime deficit Well I thought Notre Dame had to end up with six to eight threepointers And right now theyre only five out of 24 but those first early ones gave them a lot of confidence defensively Theres something about seeing shots fall that give you energy at the other end And theyve been able to stay in a stance stay in the gaps and even recover against these great sets Boston College running And then you mentioned it all night Free throw shooting might be the big story down the stretch here We got to finish this Hastings misses the front end of the one and one Wrestling for the rebound at Shrewberry and Notre Dame has the arrow Well we saw Boston College move the ball with exceptional efficiency in the first half 11 assists on 14 made field goals In the second half they have four turnovers and only one assist The Irish defense has really clamped down And now some physicality between Toutton and Hastings Evan Burrow wants to look at the monitor again Hastings has to be careful He has four fouls and tout has almost been baiting Boston College into some of this unnecessary extracurricular activity And credit to him its worked Freeze plays under review for a dead ball contact Well Boston College eight out of 12 from the free throw line That was a huge miss right there as youre trying to get back in the game But if youre a cow you dont want this going against you You know you just came up with the missed free throws You have the ball up five with 353 to go So hes walking a very fine line here and you dont want to hurt your team At the 7minute mark of the second half he won a dead ball technical in favor of Notre Dame Theres a big swing for the Irish Heres a replay of what theyre looking at over at the monitor AJ Desai Evan Burrows Jeff Pawn our officiating crew Middle of your screen 33 in white chesting up with Jaden Hastings Boy thats a whole lot of nothing until there Little bit of a forearm from the 68 250 lb grad transfer Carson Tout And here is the crew chief AJ Deside Well he got away with a flop before review incidental contact Im just going to call incidental contact So hes got hes got to knock it off I mean you got to close this out We talked about this is a must win for Notre Dame They have lost five in a row including four by double figures Marcus Rusberry has regularly talked about having the grit and grime required to win a 40minute basketball game in this league This one is trending to go the distance as a highly competitive affair Fivepoint game 340 to go Serta creating space Blocked by Hastings Toutton reathers underneath Harelson and he was fouled underneath Two shots coming as Notre Dame is in the double bonus and theres some extracurriculars Im not sure the officials saw it but the Notre Dame coaching staff sure did It was Hastings again with some contact underneath and they are not going to look at the monitor Common foul on Luca Taves Shot gets blocked Another great rebound by Tout What a pass to the baseline Foul on the floor Not sure what happened after that You said one You said Carson Ts ready to go man 13 rebounds tonight 12th game with at least 10 rebounds Harrelsons second free throw Good Sixpoint Notre Dame lead Boston College has won backto back games in comeback fashion Pain kick out Heres hand baseline Draws a blocking foul The third on Jaylen Harelson Just another great play coming out of the dead ball situation You play through Fred Payne and he snaps it over to Donald Han and he knows what to do with it He attacks the rim 72 on the year from the free throw line These are two big ones cheering Fifth missed free throw of the night for BC Youre right You got to be careful on this little hitch he has in his shot You have to wait for him to release it Makes the second 320 to go Both teams with multiple timeouts Notre Dame has won the last two meetings in this series Boston College though has won four out of the last six Oftent times highly contested Harelson high off the window Tap back good 17 for Harelson cheering hand knives might have gotten rejected by Tout and itll stay here with 14 to shoot Well Harelsons been really good in the paint Theres nothing new about that information Hes so tough attacking the rim Fumbles it a little bit Goes up and keep your eye on the jump back Just gets right back off the floor and puts it in is such an impressive freshman One of the young stars in this game has helped Notre Dame climb all the way back from down 11 Han hits a big three Donald Han Jr with his second three now with 17 to lead all Eagles back to a fourpoint game So if Tout gets the ball inside you might want to think about fouling Capy on the floor with three Top tried to go for the rebound Itll stay here Hastings also on the floor with four fouls And now Bowden Capi pointing to the Boston College bench Theyre going to challenge this Well heres the play before Boston College needing a bucket Theyve been really good at these baseline out of bounds plays They needed to see that one fall but were going to go to the monitor and review But once again Tout just keeps coming relentlessly to the board making things happen Remember in the first half Boston College out of bounds timeout Boston College to challenge that ruling Challenged an outof bounds ruling in which Notre Dame was awarded the basketball won that challenge So they were able to keep the challenge Now they will be out of challenges And assuming they get this right theyll also keep both timeouts Well be right back in 30 seconds After cheering review its a successful challenge by Boston College They will retain their timeout However they have no challenges remaining for the game So again the BC coaching staff and Earl Grant using their challenges wisely They will get the basketball back on an overturn call Last touch by Tout as the slowmo replay clearly indicates Carson is so relentless and skilled at rebounding It really is a skill Even when you have him blocked out hell spin or dive a gap or slip around you And that one just slipped out of his hands late but it was an aggressive move coming to the rim by big number 33 BC has shot just 28 in the second half Where you going offensively the rest of the game Well keep your eye on 13 attacking the rim Payton wanted to get it to him instead Took it himself Flunks it down Fred Payne with just his second bucket of the second half He has 16 Hand and pain Pain in hand Both of those guys know how to get downhill and play off each other Quite a duo Yes Shrewberry around the double team 10 to shoot Defended by Hastings WITH FOUR FOULS SHREWBERRY DRILLS A THREE 20 POINTS FOR BRADEN SHREWBERRY cheering cheering Payne gets it back from Hastings Hand off Capki cheering Hand with 10 Fadeaway jumper wont go and Shrewberry the rebound cheering Thats foul 33 here Were running out of time And the foul game will be played by Earl Grant Oh this is what hes been doing all afternoon Just making plays A little cold from three but that is so deep Pretty good defense but a clutch threepointer You mentioned foul Carson Tout but hes only a 44 free throw shooter The guy not to foul is Shrewberry whos shooting at nearly 80 from the line and he is our Daisy Cottage Cheese player of the game 20 points on eight of 17 A fantastic performance again coming off the heels of four games scoring just 22 combined points Well hes the focal point of every defense right in the league If you take him out of his game you have a better chance of winning So hes got to adjust to that and actually force the action like he did this afternoon Door left open for BC Dont need a three here but lots of time coming off the clock for the Eagles Deep three paid No rebound tapped out Hastings Now you might need a three if youre BC And a timeout called by Earl Grant He will have one remaining with 256 left Well be right back in 30 seconds for the conclusion from Notre Dame Welcome back to Notre Dame where Braden music Shrewsbury has an even 20 points on a night where Notre Dame erased an 11point deficit Well theyre doing a nice job of freeing him up He doesnt need much space Not afraid of the shot blockers just a little teardrops little shot put moves in the paint but that last three was just massive as Notre Dame makes this improbable comeback They were really stagnant offensively in the first half but hes broken out in the second trail by 13 at the beginning of the second half It was 11 at halftime Boston College still has an opportunity though down five with a timeout and 256 seconds to go Keep your eye on Luca Taves here inbounding the ball Theyre going to try to come back to him for a quick three Pay in the paint Kick out Kapi corner three wont go Got his miss Payne puts one up from downtown No Ky again the rebound Taves launches hits and there might be an extra whistle underneath as Hastings went tumbling to the floor No it appears like they played on A great job to get him involved in this game and just the offensive rebounds Those are the easiest threes to hit The number 10s been sensational this game Now things get really interesting Fourth three for Taves He now has 14 points tonight Thats an ACC season high for the sophomore from Japan Twopoint game here Both teams with at least one timeout I beg your pardon Boston College without a timeout Both teams in the double bonus They just put a few extra ten of a second on the clock So 103 How quickly do you foul here if youre BC I like to get one trap and see if theyll float a lazy pass so you can come up with the steal and then you have to get right on top of it Remember if youre Notre Dame you can run the baseline here coming out of the dead ball They have taken Carson Tout of the game He is Notre Dames worst free throw shooter This is the best free throw shooting lineup on the floor for Micah Shrewsbury Logan Ims the inbounder and he is able to run the baseline Instead pitches it to Sundra You got to foul quickly here Boy lots of time coming off BC wanted a jump ball 3 seconds though came off the clock and now its Shrewberry headed back to the line for Notre Dame I love the out of bounds play drawn up by Shrewsbury to get someone open I I think its one of the worst worst rules in sport I dont know any other sport where you can throw the pass out of bounds and come back in and play but they got the right guy to the free throw line Shrewsbury tonight three for five from the line Chance to make this a fourpoint game No timeouts for BC cheering And a timeout taken by Micah Shrewberry How good has Shrewsbury been in this second half 12 points in the second half alone on 50 from the floor Couple of big free throws Notre Dame trailed by 11 at the half 13 at the start of the second half Should they hang on This would be the largest comeback win since February 12th of last year at Boston College which went two overtimes How do you play these 71 if youre BC down four You are on instant attack As hard as you can go to the rim the best and worst thing that can happen to BC is they get fouled right Its the best thing because it stops the clock and get free throws Its the worst thing because they cant make free throws So youre attacking try to pick up the whistle or kick to the wing for a quick threepointer and then foul right away They have no timeouts If youre Notre Dame you dont want to make a foolish foul here Pay the inbounder and one of their best threepoint shooters cheering trying to get it in Does Capki pitch back pain Five to go Pay quickly to the rack Lays it in with two and a half seconds to play And Evan Burroughs just pointed to Grant BC a timeout But according to our in arena stats they dont have any timeouts And Earl Grant looked back onto his bench and wondered who called the timeout as if it wasnt him Oh my Is this a Chris Weber situation This could be devastating for Boston College It looked like they granted him a timeout Clear as day Evan Burroughs one of our officials blew the whistle pointed to the BC bench and yelled timeout What a play to draw it up I mean you couldnt ask for a better bucket applause and he grants BC the timeout which youre telling me they dont have And we are receiving word that one of the BC players called timeout They didnt have a timeout They didnt have a timeout Correct And so itll be a technical foul on BC Two shots for Notre Dame plus the ball And it was Luca Taves who called timeout for BC Well its tough for a young man whos played so well tonight Four big threes for the Eagles and Serta has just put this game on ice Seven for seven from the line tonight Cole Serta Notre Dame trail by as many as 13 They have lost five games in a row four by double figures And now Logan calls timeout It looked at least at halftime like BC was in full control of this game Credit to Micah Shrewberry credit to his staff and players They completely flipped the script And now Jess with still a month and change to go might this be the game that spurs a little run for the Irish Both of these teams are a handful They are both better than their records show because they have scores right And they can get hot You saw Notre Dame in the second half just play so much better offensively In the first half Boston College couldnt play any better themselves and theyve been on a nice tear here over the last couple games But in that second half they got frustrated They got caught up in some shenanigans took some bad shots and then just made a critical mistake on the timeout Was still an opportunity to win the game And give credit to Notre Dame for their defense as well Its been really good in the second half Held Boston College to just 32 shooting in the second half Top with the catch fittingly And that will do it from South Bay
