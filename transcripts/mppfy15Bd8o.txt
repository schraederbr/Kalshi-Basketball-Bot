I mean he he is the the Prototype of what it means to be a college basketball player the development over his time here as the poster child for what it means what that phrasing Player Development means and you saw him on The Possession he grabs the board on the other end the defensive rebound he can handle it he can lead the break becomes such a tough matchup and then oh by the way hes got the matchup against Hunter Hunter Tyson defensively its also his 24th birthday so he does it all speaks to where we are in college basketball right with red shirts and covid years and transfers and months was a highly coveted transfer from Delaware his third stop after starting at High Point his third season with Virginia Tech working on his fourth degree how many degrees did you have thats uh thats classified Denise what you tell me somebodys got four Id rather not answer Music how do you have time for four degrees four years old Music they changed the foul to PJ Paul not Sheffield substitutions now for Clemson Dylan Hunter Chase Hunters younger brother comes in Chase to the bench Applause both free throws good for mutts who comes into this game averaging 2110 Intex three ACC games theres the matchup Tyson and mutts Applause Galloway nearly lost it drops it off down low to shefflin working on bazilly and thats a good sign for Virginia Tech Brazilian did not have his best defensive game against Wake Forest struggled on the defensive end against BC as well as we get a foul a tripping yeah its interesting with bazilly a guy who transfers it from White stain had a good start to the year but all his numbers are down in conference play I think hes adjusting to the Atlantic Coast Conference and foul trouble in the last two games not help Music Here Comes Padula down the lane and cant get the layup to fall Dylan Hunter the other way a lot of hunters on the floor even though Hunter Couture is out with an injury for Virginia Tech Music no and the rebound tapped by shefflin we get a foul on the floor Music Applause its on Brazilian thats one clean looks Hunter Tyson has had in this game so far a guy who you know you mentioned the numbers he had the other day against NC State 26 of those were in the second half he had 17 straight at one point just a magnificent performance neither team connecting early on both teams have combined the two of 13 Music charismatics gets it to bazilly Tyson went for the steal and its off the foot of PJ home you know both these teams similar offensively they run a lot of Crossing stuff the ball is going to see both sides they make you defend a lot of different types of actions come on Music Applause Music 68 John Camden into the game for Virginia Tech Music kid working on Hall Music Applause gazilly shot clock down to eight and a foul on the floor and thats gonna be two on shuffle and thats a tough match up early on and free and sheffler you know we talked about the versatility of months I think better on the Block basilys a faceup guy but hes got a big body and hell post you up too I mean you know its interesting both these front lines are unique in terms of their both of their versatilities you know both front lines can step out and shoot it both a pretty good passing front lines they can post you Music Here Comes Padula weaving through traffic off the window rebound and Tyson whos averaging close to a double double on the season Chase Hunter blossoming is a point guard strong to the Tim and that was the one thing for Virginia Tech and Mike young they have to keep Chase Hunter out of the pain really off the ball screens but he looks to dive in there early and he creates so much Havoc Here Comes Maddox Padula Catch and Release Scott Applause Music the Doula just one of nine from Deep last time out in the lost to Wake Forest two of his last 14 from three Galloway at the other end youre talking about how Justin much turned 24 years old how about brother Galloway 25 years old weve got some Elder Statesman in this game a sixth year senior third stop potique wasnt ready for it middle Brooks ahead of the pack goes up misses the dunk and we get a foul as Tyson tried to clean up now the crowd here at Castle Coliseum doesnt like conference plays 20 games Ill tell you what I saw Pitt last weekend they are very good I mean they are for real theyre very old and tough I mean they can beat you in a number of different ways I go back to what Brad Brownell told us to shoot around he said what helps the ACC teams in March is you see so many different styles in this league now that hurts the conference player beating up against your own you cover the Big 12 as well you dont see that kind of variety in terms of how teams defend trapped zilly on the bench for Virginia Tech hes got two thousand months picked up one shot clock down to eight Maddox over Tyson back iron rebound to chase Unser okay Music his pass deflected and comes back to his brother Dylan Music Middlebrook sets the high screen Music the Doula in the passing Lane Galloway out to Dylan Hunter down the lane weaving inside trying to court screw through the defense and months the rebound Music Applause Elijah Poteet the 34 for Virginia Tech Junior a rice transfer is three is no good 10 continuing to struggle from the field and that was supposed to be a pass well the guys got to be looking at it hes got to know its coming you know and if your bike young what a job hes done first and foremost I mean I I think I have a ton of respect for Coach young whos it was interesting talking to him today about the last two games both losses for his team there was a different energy at their shoot around were talking about the turnover issues theyve had he said it will be rectified we do not turn the basketball over check that one thing he is having to deal with again his Grand Brazilian foul trouble and that second foul on that break is not a foul that young man can pick up and hes too valuable offensively theyve got turnover issues as Petula misses the three the last couple of games theyve given up too many offensive rebounds as Hunter goes flying in but thats going the other way offensive foul todays take the one thing for Chase Hunter is hes incredibly fast from end to end and uh man that was took a shot there in the unmentionables uh nice job standing in there but uh you know you mentioned earlier Niche that development in Chase Hunters Game hes not a point guard by trade hes certainly figuring that out its down low Jade Collins they stay with Virginia Tech well that was the big question for Clemson point guard play you lose a Nick honor to Missouri you lose alamir Dawes to Seton Hall who would run point this stamp had a lot of faith that chase Hunter could do it even though he hadnt played point guard as a primary position throughout his career as we get a travel the one thing that this backcourt this year particularly Hunter they bring in Josh Beadle whos in there now theres better positional size and those guys are six three six three Dylan Hunter 63 the one thing about that backcourt last year it was small you know Dawes is small Nick honor was small there is Beetle Richard freshman out of Columbia South Carolina Music its going to work on kid middle Brooks didnt have enough John might have been tipped Here Comes Padula accelerates bumped off Music his first duel is so tough man there is no back down in him its been a joy to watch him so far this season he added 10 pounds of muscle in the off season really crafty around the rim he plays a lot bigger than his six feet six one frame it comes from being the seventh of nine children and playing driveway games where you werent supposed to call fouls Camden too strong rebound to Tyson thank you Applause Music he had older siblings who played basketball his dad played basketball one brother played rugby so that tells you everything you need to know I think the toughness probably comes from mom who gave birth to nine children real MVP that is yeomans work right there real MVP Applause Tyson on the back door cut with authority they love that do they play through that elbow a lot that pinch post and they get that back door a ton and Tyson a little bit chilly from the outside to start this game good to get him a dunk see the ball go in and a foul on Chase Hunter and that is two on collapse in second leading scorer Hunter Tyson playing as well as anybody in this league man what a heater hes on hes allowing Sean Padula to do a lot of things this year offensively that Mike young hasnt allowed his guards to do now hes posting up hes allowing Padula to do that he says hell take some shots sometimes thatll make you scratch your head and say whoa what is he doing but you kind of have to give him that freedom thats how he loves to play there is a Fearless nature to his game its mutz working on Tyson and theres bucks putting together an allconference caliber season four for Justin months on his birthday attack had gone more than four minutes without a field goal TJ Hall looking for Tyson who gets Tangled with months down low and that is two now on Vance 21 basily so foul trouble becoming an issue with this first half for Mike young and they love that Duncan they love that Hilo Duncan and and thats the problem you know youve got basily on the bench with the two like you said and he should if youre gonna put mutts on Tyson which you know thats the matchup Music yeah and its a good call you come around like that Im gonna call him Music Don with the two fouls and lets see if Clemson attacks him Music clock down to 10 Galloway looking for the screen gets it almost turned it over Tyson from the Baseline followed by RJ Godfrey 67 freshman dad Randall played more than a decade in the NFL as a linebacker its a heck of an athlete you dont look like a freshman at least the Freshman that I grew up around Music now Buds backing down Tyson Up and Under stuffed at the rim and the twohanded rebound by Godfrey Music comes home and able to draw the foul on Min kid Music Applause is perfect how about PJ Hall your guys been through so much so much entrywise hes worked so hard to get himself back hes worked to become a low block scorer the shooting around him this year you know certainly helps his ability to do that didnt practice last year you know only played in games Music you know came down a niche to Virginia Tech and Clemson PJ Halls dad actually played for Mike Mike young at Wofford all and tysonu guy who can play outside the Tigers have a builtin defense mechanism when their threepoint shot isnt falling theyre the best threepoint shooting team in the ACC but made this team dangerous as we get a lane violation is when that shots not falling as was the case a few weeks ago against Georgia Tech they can go inside and youve got a guy like Hall with a vast wardrobe that moves in the paint Music foreign Applause Music slips Beetle trying to stay with him Padula down the lane draws the defense the Up and Under Poteet to follow and Applause come on Virginia Techs gonna have to manufacture some points theyre not shooting it well and its not just in this game you know the last few games they have not shot it well particularly for free and theyve turned a ball over theyre giving up possessions you know theyve been not great on the offensive glass they dont get to the foul line a lot I mean thats kind of been who they theyve been over the last couple years in their DNA helps to make it when you get there but they gotta find where these points are going to come from theres a lot on on Sean Padula a lot on Justin butts to score one of the guys theyre waiting on is Darius Maddox last year he was one of the best Shooters in the country 51 from three down to 27 and as a team of Virginia Tech probably wants to be in a 3738 range from three if not better at 35 right now Mike young feels there is some upside there as we get a turnover of foul down low its on Godfrey his second but Mike young feels hey where could this team grow they have the ability and the Personnel to get better as a threepoint shooting team foreign just three out of 16 for the field one of seven downtown and only one field goal in six minutes and thats stolen away Applause free against Poteet there is a lot of Mass on the Block and Godfrey with a nice touch yeah good boys took his time went to went over that left shoulder Advanced post move there from The Freshman not a lot of resistance a little bang but not a lot of resistance for Poteet wild layup by Padula Tyson another rebound hes got five beetle and the follow by Godfrey but they will wave it off basket interference Applause hes one of those if youre beetle say later on to Godfrey yo man its my bucket dude how about potique with the hammer Applause got three on both ends thats the basketball version of the Oklahoma drone Music Applause Music Applause Tyson thought about it butts has the two fouls not free from the outside the long two you mentioned his dad former football player Georges Brothers at Kentucky playing football now wanted to do his own thing be a Hooper I think hes got a chance to be pretty good only a freshman the three from the corner from Darius Maddox when the ACC Tournament game against Clemson last year hit the three at the buzzer in overtime to give Virginia a second round win the dropoff for a hall and he gets fouled young hoping that could be a shot that maybe unlocks Darius Maddox we Remind You Its UCLA and USC a bali Pavilion Thursday Eastern on ESPN Bruins ranked 10 and the country facing their Crosstown arrival tell you what Javi Hawkins having himself a Player of the Year type of season Applause for folks in the ACC footprint who havent seen them how would you describe his game you know what hes kind of a Swiss army knife its a really good question uh hes hes incredibly versatile hes physical um you know good driver of the basketball smart you know theres a toughness to that team that Mick Cronin in in a couple years two years hes been there that uh I think sort of manifests through Hawkins and you wondered when he took that job if they would have that same sort of defensive prowess they did with his teams in Cincinnati and hes brought that to Westwood his potique he doesnt have much subtlety but it works how about Justin bus twice second on their team and assists really unselfish five games this year with five or more assists for months Music Godzilla in there with the two fouls clock down to eight Godfrey lost a sneaker playing with just one sneaker but RJ Godfrey hes gliding out there he got one shoe on Applause Maddox the pullup and he hits what happened to Godfreys other sneakers is not that far from Greenville South Carolina you know what happened in Greenville South Carolina thats where Shoeless Joe Jackson got his nickname true story whos playing some Barnstorm baseball whos out in right field Music had new cleats that just didnt fit right so at some point the game he decided to take the ball from two lane just in his socks and stirrups at one point the game binds the ball into the Gap races around second base slides into third somebody from the grandstands yelled yeshuless Music stuck I mean hey I cant verify your story you could be making that entire thing up well done if you are but I believe you true story and nobody connects the dots quite like you RJ Godfrey in a game in Blacksburg Virginia loses a shoe Clemsons not even in Greenville South Carolina its close though its like 40 minutes thats where the airport is yeah you are you are one of the best in the business thats why you get paid the big bucks RJ Godfrey now this is where you do your work yeah hes talented and like you said theyre real high on him hes kind of a Dirty Work guy right now one of those athletes but as he showed you on that play there theyll throw it to him on the Block he can step out hit up hit a faceup shot a good athlete he started actually in their last game against NC State got into foul trouble early in that game but you know six seven 225 pounds shoeless RJ Godfrey well did they find the sneaker Applause One More Shot by the way theres Alex Hemingway standing there uh outside the Huddle as good a shooter as there is in this league you know one of the most feared Shooters in this league so playing without him and plantar fasciitis which is a brutal injury to have its a lingering injury to have be interesting to see if theyre able to get him back in the line he was in a walking boot for a while hes finally out of the boot missing now his third straight game and on the other side of Virginia Tech missing its best shooter we saw in the ACC tournament what Hunter Couture could do when hes high Music yeah it took a brutal fall in that game against Boston College I was I was calling that gay physical game how about BC two and two in the league by the way were showing the standings earlier Music but just a brutal fall for 100 Couture and like you said one of those other offensive weapons that a team that are struggling from the perimeter to make shots a team that could use a punch of offense is not good now Mike young youre telling us he hopes to have Couture back this weekend against NC State would not commit though Applause Music officially day to day we welcome those of you whove been watching on ESPNU uh Clemson with a threepoint lead on Virginia Tech and hes Rob Chris patola from Castle Coliseum Hokies have lost two straight in League Play on the road at BC on the road and wake theyre 80 at home theyve won Sno at home theyve won nine straight overall at home and for Clemson the tigers are 30 in ACC play the last time they started 40 in League Play the 9697 season when Rick Barnes was head coach and Greg Buckner was their leading scorer that was a sweet 16 team tigers by three its been a defensive game so far Hunter Tyson coming off a 31 Point 15 rebound game misfires last Clemson Tiger to go for 30 and 15 in a game before Tyson Horus Grant back in 1987 against Wake Forest I mean every everything there except to finish I mean really good execution on that set Brevin Galloway with his second three eight hes a volume shooter and when he heats up he can carry a team for stretches Music Applause Music just Justin Muntz hes got two fouls so does Grant bazillion who controls now Maddox thought about it mutts from the corner knocks it down Chris the way he has evolved his offensive game next time in Blacksburg a testament to Mike young in Player Development no question he is the poster child for for that phrase Player Development and Hunter Tyson just left him ball watching as Maddox got in the air or MJ Collins rather got in the air heres hall for three and the answer and thats where these two front lines you know lots on one end gets a threes now bringing up the ball and then PJ Hall Hunter Tyson that front line for Clemson can also face up hit a three Jay Collins the freshman Lots on the triple drive over Godfrey a lot of contact whats one of the foul gets the basket instead in their three conference games hes averaging 2110 good as tough a matchup as anybody in this league at 18 and 11 over the weekend Beetle just beat his man to the river Music hes gonna be a good player the redshirt freshman hes really Shifty quick hes got Jitterbug vibes zilly lost it recovers College down low bazilly lines it up it does not go battle for the offensive rebound and well get a foul on Clemson Music not Kentucky and number seven Alabama Saturday one Eastern on ESPN whats wrong with Kentucky man they cant they dont know they dont know what they are or what they could be offensively uh they just even watching them last night in that game against LSU you know youve got a monster on the interior youve got a point guard in savior wheeler who I think can create a lot theres just a lot of guys who are trying to figure out who they are how they fit in offensively there was an article in the athletic this week where opposing coaches speaking anonymously were saying that John caliparis offense is not The Cutting Edge offense it used to be do you buy that I buy it theres not much different you know and I I think some of it comes down to the Jimmys and the Joes that that hes got on their roster you know there hasnt been a lot of complication to John caliparis office like you watch these two teams who watched it Clemson Virginia Tech and they run a lot of stuff a lot of Crossing stuff a lot of actions and sets that theyre calling theres not a lot of that with Kentucky and I think sometimes when you have guys who dont have that IQ or certainly that offensive capability you could bog down Godfrey meanwhile just picked up his third foul he had provided a nice little Lift Off the Bench its the driveby the pullup good Breakout game for him its been a real struggle making shots for Darius Maddox but Mike young trying to steal a few minutes here Justin mutz with the two fouls now on the bench Applause Here Comes Maddox the other way and found by Tyson on the way off Tyson making the case that he got all balled number five hundred first Music Applause Music excuse me hes a no layup foul right there nicely executed by Hunter Tyson the double bonus Fanatics with eight points in the first half last year 51 three down to 27 boy if he can bring that number up just a little bit it changes the calculus offensively right now Music Applause Tyson from the outside and that rolls out Lynn Kidd the Clemson transfer grabs the rebound Tyson just one of seven from the field after a career night the last time out and hes had clean looks in his first half entry pass to bazilly too much air and its middle Brooks with the intercept those are the turnovers that we are not used to Virginia Tech committee young said thats not who we are we cannot turn the ball over Applause Tyson again Shooters gonna shoot now one of eight Applause Virginia Tech with a chance to tie they can take the lead with a three to his LED most of this first half heres Maddox for the lead its in another rebound hes done the work on the glass thats six rebounds the timeout for those of you watching on ESPN news to keep watching this game flip over to ESPNU Music first half which has led to the foul trouble weve seen its also led to turnovers both teams locked in defensively done a nice job guarding a lot of the stuff that both teams throwing at you know a lot of as we mentioned a lot of sets a lot of Crossing actions denials in the post eight turnovers for Clemson has really I think afforded Virginia Tech the opportunity to climb back into this game The Hokey is only shooting 10 of 27 from the field three of 11 from Deep Clemson has made Seven of its last 11 from Midfield Here Comes Dylan Hunter Galloway back iron battle for the board its medulla gives it up to months playing that point forward theres the matchup Munson Tyson Applause medulla using that Poteet screen Maddox bothered by Galloway shot clock down to five Padula down the lane wild shot Middlebrook saves it foreign Music with yes Pittsburgh whos sitting there at 40 Music Here Comes Galloway falling down and called for the travel Music was interesting on that last possession when Padula gave it up to mutts Padula ran down to the paint they were actually running across screen to get him onto the block and Beetle developed defended it really really well but it just shows you some of the creativity Mike Youngs had to go to to try to create some offense and what hes been able to do with a guy like Sean Padula and youre starting to see beetle break in the Brad Brownell circle of trust season High 29 minutes last time out against NC State they like his defense hes held Padula to Just One of eight shooting and two turnovers brazily working on Tyson now Max driving on Tyson no loose ball rebound Maddox new 20 bazilly shot fake Drive much down low good position the follow not there and comes back to months knocked away out of bounds and it stays with Virginia Tech a really good passing teams I mean that was big to Big basilian with a really nice touch on that bounce pass to months thank you when you say good passing teams its the bigs who can pass real well too it is basily and the Wright State transfer gives Virginia Tech the lead Music we get a timeout with a once a great debut with the Hokies 30 points in his debut with Virginia Tech last couple of games foul trouble defense lacking but he comes through with a big three and Mike young takes Brazilian matau both those guys with two fouls PJ Hall not in there as well for Clemson hes got two fouls Chase Hunter also with two on the bench for the Tigers Tyson backing down Camden heres Beetle shot clock winding down Beetle trying to drop it off down low out of bounds and that is turnover number 10 in this first half for Clemson tell you what those two guards Petula and fielder are going after one another that Beatles carved out a roll on this team with his defense he plays hard I mean thats the thing he is a live wire he plays really hard hes really quick foreign Music hes played big minutes in this first half with Hunter on the bench Jake Collins down Music the Doula would tend to shoot Beetle stays with him step by step Maddox looking for separation fall away too strong Tyson brings it down after Tyson just one of eight oh six for three it does have six rebounds at a nine second differential shot clock and game clock Chauncey Wiggins misfires and Virginia Tech can hold for one Applause Music Maddox with three lets it go that hits the game high 11 for Applause Music is he coming out of his shooting slump for Virginia Tech Hoagies with a threepoint lead going into halftime Virginia Tech finishing for the first 20 minutes on a 90 run Music put together 11 in the first half to lead all scorers patola pokeys looking to snap a twogame losing streak theyre one in three or one and two in ACC play the one win was against UNC losses on the road to BC and Wake Forest Clemson looking to start 40 in the ACC for the first time since that 97th season which ended to the Sweet 16 run Grant pizzilli picked up 2000 the first half too strong there and Tyson trains in his eighth rebound Tyson coming off a 31point game just two points on one of eight shooting in that first half Here Comes Brevin Galloway to the 10 and one lumps it a chance to tie its interesting the leading scorer for both teams on the season mentioned Hunter Tyson one of eight Sean Padula also one of eight and so both teams have had to get some other guys involved here and one of those guys brought in Galloway the transferred for Boston College you know hes talking to him earlier today hes the best hes felt physically you know Torres ACL played at around 225 pounds last year at Boston College down to about 210 so he lost some weight shooting the ball well another guy that helps out on the defensive end that was his calling card when he was at the College of Charleston a guy who could shoot the three play quality defense medulla looking for Maddox and thats Galloway in the passing Lane Zach coming off an ACC tournament title last year was a seven seed and theyre running Brooklyn started with a second round win against Clemson Darius Maddox at three at the buzzer in overtime Doula contested knocks it down on her Chef equipment Sean Padula 17 and a half the game looking to get going during the second half its that triple hand off those handoffs off the pitch post both those both these teams run a lot of that but Doula almost came up with a steal almost got Mike young too oh my God foreign Music ER played less than seven minutes in the first half with two fouls and we get one down low as PJ Hall hits the deck its going to be on kid thats his third game third personal second team Applause Elijah Poteet back in he gave Texas quality minutes in the first half teammates at Clemson Lynn kid to transfer from Clemson to Virginia Tech they had a very cordial exchange threegame exchange exchanging pleasantries then in the paints Music you know that that twoheaded monster of Poteet and Lynn kidding but when they were coming off of the bench when Hunter Couture was in the lineup you know theyre giving Mike young about 105 combined which is really good bench production on the interior Poteet picked up that last foul something Virginia Tech didnt have last year which was depth at the forward positions as Hunter misfires you had much you had Kevin Luma you didnt really have a whole lot after that Padula the driving dish comes back to Maddox Padula from the corner hits Applause Hokies have their largest lead Paul looking to answer knocks it down Applause Music Music and stay with tech thats nine now for PJ Hall including two threes Music wow the Doula feeling it well it is defense sense of urgency he just hit one hes starting to cook here in his second half and that was not communicated well Applause Music Hunter down the lane and able to draw the foul fourth team foul already time Virginia Tech naughty not even timeout and that is going to be heres the shot and look you cant go under it if youre going to switch and Chase Hunters got to be there earlier youve got to understand cthulhas coming off that and its on a good shot but its not well defended theres got to be a greater sense of urgency and more communication our first foul on Padula Music Hunter enjoying a breakout season first three seasons with the Tigers only managed two 20point games went for 20 or more and three of the first seven games this year he had been their leading scorer most what was the season until Hunter Tyson started getting out of late Doula and Hunter matched up now Brazilian Tyson foul on Tyson as Brazilian puts it on the floor thats two on the fifth here Music all right Music the doula at this time thats a heat check sure is but thats the kind of shot that he has been allowed to take theyre going to live with those types of shots Hunter getting three and Clemson within one Music Applause Music Maddox off the basily screen Padula again hes had the hot hand in the second half Music Applause Maddox overhaul the rebound to shuffling Tyson calling four to the corner Hunter didnt see him Hunter on the drive dumps it off shuffling down low follows his Miss MOX takes it away lob down low bazilly the shot fake and a little advising three times can we see big to Big with Virginia Tech mutts to bazilly or the other or vice versa and a nice run of the floor by bezilla to get up in front of the rim Clemson turns it over for the 12th time Virginia Tech by three Sean Padula starting to heat up Sean petulas had in the nonconference he has not shot it well in their three conference games three of 19 from three coming into this game he has started to get it going here with one of eight in the first half two threes in this second half now three of six and they go as he goes Anish like when he starts to get it going his Moxie kind of carries over to the rest of their team now hes been the Catalyst All Season better than 17 points per game the team leading scorer went from a bench roll as a freshman to now a starring role and hes probably the leading candidate right now for ACC most improved player Elijah pots eat the rice transfer Hunter tries to steal it away and does keeps it in bounds Godfrey he filled up the stat sheet in the first half seven points for rebounds Paul going to work over Poteet PJ Hall so so smooth 24 he and Tyson love that fade away Tyson Moore but both of them can go to that and he took a shot for Poteet into that shot Music months looking for help here comes Padula down the lane blocked by Hall tips it back to God three Here Comes Galloway Hunter thought about it drives dishes Galloway fires strong wants the rebound Ill let the block and then save by PJ Hall Music Maddox has the mismatch Boutique down low hes got a mismatch on Galloway and Galloway really didnt have any other option present and a really good recognition by Poteet knowing who was on him and then Justin muds once again big to big Music postentry pass to get Virginia Tech to the foul line again a team that does not get to that foul line a lot its been a disadvantage for them they are minus 18 at the foul line in their three conference games Music tonight over three at the strut Applause Poteet last time out a seasonhigh nine points season High 18 minutes and the lost awake forced over the weekend rice transfer and you couldnt tell he likes the physical contact he likes banging bodies down low what gave it away we had RJ Godfrey and he go at it a few times in the first half and maybe you could hear the Reverb in the upper deck Applause hunter lost to Padula the other way hes got Maddox as a trailer Padula forces it up no God for the rebound and now Clemson looking to run Hunter to Hunter Tyson and he knocks it down tied at 44 as we come up not 14 minutes to play first three of the game for Tyson foreign six of his 31 in that NC State game came in the second half basily theres a three four three Josh Beatle getting ready to check in he did a nice job defensively on Padula in that first half months ding up Tyson Music seven to shoot hunter gets the screen from Middlebrooks working around Poteet shot clock down to two down to one Hunter beats the shot clock missed the shot and here comes Padula and the Hokies mutts spinning whirling Maddox comes away with it the Fall Away not their rebound middle Brooks all right Justin months auditioning for an and one video bringing it back Godfrey bodying up against Brazilian whos got the two fouls Galloway brazili held his ground Tyson for three knocks it down but tied again at 47 and Hunter Tyson starting to heat up Music a doula down the lane the dropoff not there Galloway with the steal numbers for Clemson Galloway to the basket blocked by team basily rips it away Applause its the new year its conference play mutts no call and now Tyson and Poteet get tangled Applause Elijah Poteet what a treat Big Time block off of Virginia Tech turnover and no free lunches at The Rim tonight weve seen a lot of mislaves weve seen a lot of challenges as well Music but a physical game protein just picked up his second foul on Virginia Tech who comes in for the Tigers Dylan hunter in there as well Lynn Kidd and MJ Collins now at the end of the game for the Hokies Hall down the lane a little bigger roll and an offensive foul and thats three on PJ Hall foreign Hall just picking up his third foul before we went to break and he finds a seat on the Clemson bench and Brad Brownell thought that maybe basily was in the restricted area he was clearly not this is a big time take not only does it change the possession but you pick up like you said the third its a big time play by Grandpa silly there no trouble for collection Godfrey with three hole with three Hunter and Chef with both with two silly and mods both picked up two in the first half neither have committed a foul in the second half tied at 47 less than 12 minutes to go in regulation fourth conference game for both teams Clemson 30 Virginia tech one and two and the Hokies turn it over you know its interesting both these teams run that back screen where they you know you get that UCLA Cut and both teams set it like some teams go through the motions on that back screen both these teams will set that tool it was open you just couldnt make a pass Music theres Tyson two points away for his eighth DoubleDouble of the Season Music God resets the screen Hunter hesitates drives Godfrey for three its good RJ got three the first three of his career that was not in the scouting report was not in the play it was kind of a late find by Chase Hunter last second Big Shot now MJ Collins not pretty set a career high points as well with 10 as Brazilian dancers with a two inside hes been much better tonight struggled in the last two games was in foul trouble in both big offensive rebounds at the end of the Wake Forest loss middle Brooks against kid middle Brooks threw the two Twin Towers and he stopped Applause Music and Padulas fouled thats Hunter thats his third hey its going to be on Middlebrooks instead Music Brad Brownell fifth longest tenured head coach in the ACC were seeing a shift in that position over the last few years Rick Pitino God Roy Williams retired when she makes you retired Jim mayheim is still there yes he is and dont ask him about it Brazilian cant get that to fall a lot of mislayups around the rim for both teams oh Padula and Hunter to do that 16 fouls now so Clemson from here on out in the bonus Music 10 to shoot Hunter on the drive lost it recovers drops it off middle Brooks finishes is Hunter just stays with the play you know those are those kinds of plays you you pop in the tape at the end of a gate like this the Virginia Tech you had it and were gonna foul on Godfrey thats number four Music chase you know its his penetration again go back to the shooter out earlier today such a key for Virginia Tech the priority keeping Chase Hunter out of the pain the pain his penetration breaks down the defense had such good spacing this season and so much of it starts with Hunter Music and their ability to shoot kid backing down middle Brooks now bazilly Applause cracked down by beetle Galloway from 18 yes hes been big tonight Applause 11 now for Brevin Galloway older brother Braden was a tight end at Clemson Muntz Falling Away off the front rim shefflin is there Music Tyson for three yes sir Im sir Tyson with 119 in the second half hes in three straight from downtown and Clemson extends to an eightpoint lead Tennessee state had 31 and hes got some clean looks she said Shooters shooting the first half but he has continued to fire away and you cant relax

shots and its its its just not productive particularly at this point in the game can get a better look seven unanswered by Virginia Tech and a onepoint game Applause Godfrey too strong Padula Outlet to brazily and fouled on the way up chance to give Tech the lead from the freethrow line what a run on the floor by Miss hilly I mean he got out ran the floor showed his hand and a nice little drop

arent back but this place is getting louder Applause seven ties five lead changes tonight its been a game runs in this second half Virginia Tech down eight at one point they fought back Clemson to have to reclaim this with the momentum Virginia Tech hats but a game runs both teams have two timeouts left a double bonus Clemson with a single bonus Hunter got Padula in the air and draws the foul telling you on those back screens at that foul line area they set them and thats what shakes Chase owner loose there and a really nice shot fake Hunter is 77 free throw shooter Applause maybe the most amazing stat Clemson now nine of ten at the free throw line tonight Chris in their ACC games this year they came in 58 out of 62 as a team as a team better than 90 percent in conference play small sample size yes impressive nonetheless sure is Music Maddox hasnt taken away Hunter the other way and the twohanded finish what a defensive play and he read that thing the whole way he knows thats a curl Maddox coming off he stuck his paw in there poked it away they remember and that was Hall nearly picked up his fifth kid the former Clemson Tiger dangerous pass bazilly and kid the follow ing a timeout by Mike Young Tech has one left now this is a set that Virginia Tech runs and Chase Hunter digs off of Sean Padula to come down and get that thing away and then a nice job finishing athletically on the other end Music hes been huge tonight you know his defense he and Beetle on Petula and then hes come up here big down a stretch of this game but doulas got 11 points but four of 15 percent of the world yeah hes had to work all night now the big offensive weapons for Virginia Tech none have really shot it well brazily five out of 14 months three out of 11 Music wind it out slugfest and Virginia Tech wins they get to 22 in League Play the Hokies for defending ACC tournament champions a program now that has been to the last five NCAA tournaments the is their High Renaissance Clemson won just eight League games last year a chance to get halfway to that total here on the 4th of January I think Road Wings become so important well Clemsons already got one you look

Tigers get back a three to tie Music Applause the Doula against Hunter Maddox Corner three in and out is there and Brevard Galloway was ball watching he is he expected Petula to drive it a catch and shoot opportunity heres Hall catch and release a rebound by Padula come up on a minute to play Maddox and that left corner a familiar spot the doulas runner not there big rebound and comes to schifflin and hes tied up and fouled itll be a one and one for Ian shefflin percent free throw shooter you know I know youre fighting for the rebound thats a giveaway foul and youre youve defended the last two possessions youve gotten stops if youre Virginia Tech its not a smart play for Justin butts you allow you just pointed out how good they are from the foul line now its shefflin its a big spot for him but nonetheless its not a good foul and its a oneonone and it does not go one minute Music months against shefflin who got the storm today with Alex Hemingway still out now Maddox Music 10 to shoot 45 seconds to play mutts draws the foul hes got two shots coming trying to pull Virginia Clemson and Brad Brownell looking to escape Blacksburg with a win hard to do the Hokies of one nine straight here 80 this season you know its been a quiet scoring night for Justin months hes averaging 21 points in their three conference games I think part of that is hes had the assignment of Hunter Tyson all night hes done the other things now and thats four assists Music and gets a boat Applause Music Applause tons are on the drive leans in draws the contact and draws the foul he got Padula in the air and he knew he was going to at least get two shots out of it thats four on Padula he wanted that because he had Hunter Tyson wide open in the corner I mean look at Hunter Tyson in the far Corner hes begging for it said that shot fake is such a weapon for Chase Hunter Applause a twoshot foul and Hunter hits the first if he makes this and youre Clemson Chris do you foul up three not yet no no play this out you know Im around it depends on who you talk to well seven six seven eight seconds is where youre going you play this this solid defensively Music Applause threepoint game Virginia Tech has one timeout Clemson with two attack has missed its last three Applause against Hunter wild shot no tipped up battle for the rebound its Tyson and he is able to call a timeout or did he get foul he got foul how about Chase on her defensively he ends up on basily they end up switching Nats and hes strong enough to defend and then Brazilian just off balance you know he just couldnt get self his feet under him to get a good shot there Tyson their best free throw shooter 89 11 points 14 rebounds tonight Applause Music double doubles off the season three in a row he has played at the level so far from the first team allconference forward this would make it a fivepoint game with less than 16 seconds that last free throw made it a two possession game Applause gets them both you dont need three but you got to get this thing towards the rim quickly Padula lost Beetle stops fires Applause Music Applause well you didnt necessarily need three unless the defender falls down and it was the speed the burst of Padula that gets Beatle off balance in the change of Direction my goodness and a nice sold separately no kidding and a nice job settling himself he didnt rush the shot got his feet under him wow 43 for Padula hes got 14 Webster now with a twopoint lead and the ball 107 seconds to go both teams of the double bonus Music Applause Tigers will likely put their best free throw shooters on the floor Virginia Tech well have to bow if you can get it inbound but Chris what can you try to do to alter deflect the inbounds pass well it depends on how you defend the ball you know what kind of size theyll be able to run the Baseline and as I always say offensively the most important player on the floor is the inbounder its critical in this position and then guys for Clemson have to be receivers and then you got two options if you might young if you put somebody on the ball to just kind of trace it make the pass difficult or you take that guy off the ball the first guy who breaks loose you stay with him theres a number of ways to defend it do you put somebody on the ball no I would I would take somebody Id have somebody kind of face guard to see who pops free early make that initial thrust a difficult pass and maybe you get the secondary guy to be the catcher were told theyre going to add a little time 112 so a half second added Tyson will inbound s shadowing Tyson and as Chris said because this comes off of a made basket Hunter Tyson can run the Baseline gotta catch it strong if he climbs it Tyson gets it into Hall into the front Court beetle will wait and he is fouled by Camden you know its interesting Hall gave that up Beetle has only taken five free throws you know you got to keep that ball if youre PJ Hall the Junior and they may have to add some time the clock continued to run after the foul so the officials go to the monitor is now about the clock Music when does the foul occur currently the clocks is 54 Music youre gonna get almost two seconds back if youre Virginia Tech and Beetle three of five at the free throw line this season the redshirt freshman Columbia South Carolina his defense has been a big story tonight it has hes gonna be a good player you know a guy who red shirted last season was able to practice all year so 73 off the clock and the way our world works now the play where Padula hits the three he falls down and breaks his ankle thats the one that gets beamed and put on YouTube but his defense on Padula for most of the game is a big reason why Clemson has a chance to win one on the road here Applause Beetle misses the first if he makes this this is where you think about Fallon Applause Music Applause Clemson 14 of 17 at the line as a team tonight Applause gets the second its a threepoint game Darius Maddox hit the three in overtime in Brooklyn in the ACC tournament last season months will inbound lets see if Clemson fouls and when they do if they do Padula gets it off Camden retrieves thats a two and Clemson is 40 in the ACC for the first time since that 1997 sweet 16 Season with two Road wins in those four wins and they earned this one tonight this was a game of runs for both sides they were down at the half by one Hunter Tyson gave gave him a lift hes fighting that
