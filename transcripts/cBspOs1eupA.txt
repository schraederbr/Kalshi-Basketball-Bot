about a very thin front Court a back court for the Cardinal the front court for the Demon Deacons is a little more thin than it would be otherwise so maybe on both sides a short bench tonight Stanford wins the tip and the Cardinal have the ball first without a traditional point guard were going to see how Kyle Smiths offense runs in this one well they left Ryan agarwall wide open and he knocks down to three he says you cant do that now me percentages might be down a little lately but that thats a shot I can hit got a pretty stable starting lineup for Wake Forest Tyler Johnson who wasnt playing a whole lot early in the year the point guarders got the ball right now has earned his way into a lot more playing time as The Seasons gone on Fon Reed down low scores with his left hand well he does there was a switch out top REO up top and now they big fella down low taking advantage of the mismatch I guess technically the guy who just shot the ball sellers is the point guard for Stanford tonight long rebound offensive rebound for the Cardinal I think its going to be a group effort yeah itll be done by committee Dave youre right about that because uh these guys have not been used to running the show for the Cardinal all year sellers missed the three now Stanford with the shot clock winding down needs to get another one off agar wall double team so Reno down low and the pass was probably too late anyway not handled cleanly by Young well and I like what Wake Forest has done theyve gone out now theyve trapped theyve blitzed some ball screens theyre going to make it go down to a short clock and maybe our first instance of when you dont have your point guard on the floor late shot clock maybe not as organized as you would be ordinarily yeah Jaylen Blakes can get you something right they going have to dig deep to find somebody Music else Cameron HRI is at a nice wake career attacks and scores with his left hand maybe the toughest player for the Demon Deacons yeah wakes not afraid to attack at The Rim you can see their game plan early is to go inside ball knocked away and sto hildr out on the break will lay it in well thats a bad turnover in in the respect that you turn it over and it leads to a basket stord not getting back in transition something your point guard usually does every possession wake for is better than anybody else in this league at forcing turnovers on defense that one led directly to the layup heres Reno against Reed pinned along the Baseline double team stolen away and then hildr loses it out of bounds so shot clock doesnt reset but Stanford will keep the ball well another short clock but you can see the strategy early DAV its to get their hands on as many balls challenge passes challenge the dribble and then they just dug it out of the uh hands of maxing Reno on the Block so theyre really challenging everything on the floor coach forb is really good at this in his Music staff agar wall blitzed again Reno down low theres young to the D that time the pass worked well very good ball rotation the Trap took place place but that ball was zi pass to pass the ball moves faster than the Defenders Donovan young whos been hurt for Stanford playing tonight raino went for the steel didnt get it and now Reed trying to drive against rno they got rno that first meeting between these two teams they got him in foul trouble early yeah great defensive play by Stanford they just returned the favor great double down in the block and the turnover Jaylen Thompson getting his first start tonight number 24 has not played a whole lot this year in the starting lineup with the players missing down low theres Thompson who scores and a foul well give Stanford Credit Dave they are getting the ball rotated coming out of those traps and something theyre not not used to but you can see the ball rotation is excellent there is the drive by agarwall the zip and the Quick Pass inside and the finish in a chance for threepoint play great ball movement well KY Smith us hey if you dont have your point guard its not like everybody else cant pass they can chip in Thompson completes the threepoint play he gave St Stanford did not play well over the weekend at SMU and Blakes missed that game as well they definitely missed him on Saturday but Thompson gave him some energy Off the Bench maybe earn this start Johnson a little too hard threw that pass right through the hands of Trayvon Spillers now and to your point Dave you you theyve got two games now thatll be under their belt without jayen Blakes but Kyle Smith you know a master at creating things for his team hes been a winner at every stop and so hes going to make some adjustments but hes had a real Challenge on his hands today sers picked up his dribble Reno for three no looked good coming out of his hand Hunter Salas with the rebound a waks going to push Tempo a little Applause bit Spillers played really well against Stanford in Winston Salem nice move there again Dave the interior attack its been their their their motive so far is to put the ball inside and not settle for outside shots theyve attacked the rim every possession here it is you can see on the replay theyre going oneonone on the Block and theyre getting some return for their dollar uh theyre scoring it down low 18 points 10 rebounds for Spillers when these two teams played a few weeks ago oiah sers having a really good year Thompson nice look young three no good Reno offensive rebound got knocked down ball in to Thompson for the dunk I dont think that was a pass but a great opportunity for Donovan young to be there on the spot and finish Stanford hanging tough early despite being down a couple of guys Johnson to the basket no REO snatches the rebound and Max I think were going to see this a little bit tonight the big man can be a ball handler he loves it European players they can hand handle the basketball they they do it from an early age agar wall wants to go oneonone against the much smaller Johnson and he gets a bucket I love it David Stanford saying look you can attack us down low were going to do the same Stanfords got some pretty good size on the floor theyre not afraid to go down in the block as well Stanfords 12 one at home this year they played really well on this floor Hunter sales kicks it to a wide open hildr who knocks down the three yeah its good ball rotation Stanford over over extended down there yet I think they left two guys on the ball a little longer than normal so were going to have to adjust uh to that as the game will goes on both teams shooting the ball well in the first five minutes agarwall feeling very confident had his pocket pick though and then he commits a foul Dave this is really a big uh change for Wake Forest they are really a much improved defensive team and you can see that theyre theyre tough but theyre getting it done on offense ball rotation open threes you got to cover me I can knock that down Music Rel Jo Music Music Music a packed Saturday of college basketball for you headline by these two great matchups and a little adjustment to the time of the Duke Clemson game by the way Florida Auburn time 10 matchup in the SEC that scene at Auburn these days is so so impressive on ESPN 2 ESPN Duke Clemson here in the AC dick vital his first game of the year on the call of that one and just a couple of the big time matchups on Saturday on ESPN ESPN 2 were here tonight for an important game in the ACC Stanford 7 and four in conference Play Wake eight and three team of deacons played Duke very tough and at home fell a little bit short spillers out of the timeout missed the shot so Stanford has the ball only the second Miss from the field for Wake Forest Reno whips another pass down low it got deflected out of bounds off of hildr Cameron hildr is flying all over the court on the defensive end well theres no doubt defensively I think both teams are really are good defensive teams yet both teams are shooting 83 and and 62 respectfully from the floor nice inbound Thompson his second dunk already and his third basket yeah making K Smith look pretty good da putting him in the starting lineup hes been a seldom used player and hes ready to go surprised some people I think when Stanford said he was going to be the guy to be in the starting lineup with Blakes out now Salis attacks against Thompson who fouled him well Jaylen Thompsons from Oakland so hes a tough kid I mean you know hes a local guy and hes really uh hes earned this hes played well in practice and and hes done a good job in his recent games third year in the program so hes been around a little Music Applause while and we welcome those of you joining us here at Maples Pavilion Dave Fleming Ben Braun Stanford 14 wake 11 important game late night in the ACC one of the top players in the conference Hunter Salis at the free throw line just missed the first of two hes been quiet but hes been about the only one both teams playing very well offensively in these first few minutes well Salis and raino have been quiet but I can guarantee you theyre not going to be quiet for long those guys know what its like to to be in big games to score but both teams are good defensive teams theyre going to make some adjustments its going to be interesting to see again whos going to handle the point guard duties so far a different guyss brought it up every possession for Stanford a wake beat Stanford 8067 two and 12 weeks ago a little alley play and the shot was blocked but theres Cameron Grant the walkon who has earned minutes for Stanford to clean it up a foul on the floor so hildr went to the basket and draws the First on I love if you watch again Stanford how aggressive theyve been the biggest play on the floor throwing the alley maybe a little foul in there but the followup great Hustle by a Stanford theyve gotten some good inside looks so far in this game Stanford missing its star point guard Jaylen Blakes whos had a terrific year out for a second straight game with a head injury and hope to have him back on Saturday attacking the basket what a move from Johnson against REO scored with a big siiz disadvantage Tyler Johnson aggressive to the basket the sophomore from Brooklyn shows his ability another pass from raino down another shot deflected that was Point black range and a slow start for oiah sers hes trying to figure out what just happened now a foul called against Grant well you do have two of the best players in this league Salah fourth best score hes done a lot of everything for wake fors and Max re know as of right now hes the leading scorer and the leading rebounder in ACC now these two guys get it done they do it every game theyre very consistent you got to put part most of your game plan together to stop top players of this caliber Johnson goes to the basket high off the glass again with a hand in his face two impressive moves from Tyler Johnson to tie the game well now look who your new point guard is Dave how about your seven footer bringing it up I mean it is true Maxim Reno with no Blakes in the game tonight he is going to function on a lot of possessions as the Stanford point guard well I love it hes skilled and hes showing you why now hell catch and face whips a pass across the court Grant open no good raino there for the offense of rebound hes the best rebounding point guard I know anywhere yeah thats pretty safe to say but I love the look there getting a wide open three for his teammate hes Distributing from a sevenfooter from up top from the wing uh hes an excellent passer but you know I dont think he thought he was going to be playing point guard his senior or his last year but he is thats good showcase for his allaround skill yeah so theres Blakes on the bench Stanford really missed him on the road on Saturday at SMU they did not play very well theyve been playing really well as a team lately Ager wall almost had it stolen away now Blakes a great defender too so theyre missing their best defensive player and right now no raino and no Blakes on the floor wheres the offense going to come from agarwall from way outside too strong offensive rebound Grant had a hand on it but it was ripped away by the Demon Deacons Sal finds a wide open teammate right side no good Juke Harris missed the three the game stays tied sers trying to get his offense going attacks and draws the foul well if youre Stanford youre going to give up some threepoint shooting because Wake Forest Dave is only shooting 28 on the year so youre going to give up I dont think they want to give up wide open shots but youre going to live with that as opposed to giving up shots at The Rim but I like Stanfords approach offensively theyre trying to get the ball to the rim theyre not settling theyre missing a lot of their scoring but theyre getting the ball to the basket and theyre doing a good job of attacking and this young man oiah sers transfer from USC averaging almost 15 points a game hes the number one threepoint shooter in the league in conference games only makes the first of two free throws Thursday Prime Time womens college basketball matchup you got number five Yukon number 19 Tennessee thats a good one in Stanford desperately they need a big win Cardinal not used to on the womens side being in the position theyre in this year so thats big game for Stanford at number three Notre Dame on Thursday on ESPN now Stanford women will bounce back theyve done it for so many years uh and and theyve just been one of the the premier programs but strug a little bit this year but theyll theyll come back oh possibility they miss the tournament for the first time in decades been ages hriff got fouled on the floor by Evans stin who just checked in the game and immediately commits a foul thats been a problem for Stanford in these first 8 minutes a lot of fouls called against the Cardinal they do have a twopoint lead here against Wake Forest at Maples back right after this Music and Music C tonight Applause Music for the second year in a row Wake Forest Finds itself squarely on the NCAA bubble so the deakes can ill afford any losses to teams below them in the ACC standings tonights 5050 game at Stanford following the huge bubble win over pit could be just the result wake needs to avoid a repeat of last seasons selection Sunday snow I think there is some sensitivity in Winston Salem about what happened last year demon deakon in good position this year SMU with another win tonight so theyre a half game ahead awake fourth all alone as of right this moment Duke still the only undefeated team in conference play second ranked team of the country but the glass half full wake sort of on the bubble wide open three left side in and out no good this is a chance for a quality win for Wake Force now theres no doubt and I Ive been in there that shoes Dave as a coach you know I had teams that had some big wins but you know at the end of the year you dont want to be snub you want to do everything you can to give your team a chance to get to the tournament pass that almost went out of bounds Stanford avoided the turnover well see if sers can rescue this possession no but Donovan young there on the offensive glass missed the putback ball tipped around and finally wake comes away with it now Stanfords really hit the offensive BL hard now theyve had theyve had a lot of opportunities at The Rim uh and come up short a couple of times but theyve been attacking it well Trayvon Spillers gets fouled from behind by Aiden camon you know Dave getting back again to to the W week Forest you know they theyve had some good wins they theyve beaten North Carolina theyve beaten Michigan earlier and Stanford but its about what have you done for me lately and you got to continue to win going into the tournament wow very poor inbound defense from Stanford and a good job by wake to take advantage of it Cameron hild draws another foul now Kyle Smith not happy hes a good defensive coach but you know you play inside out at the basket they went over that and shoot around today we were there and they dont want to give up anything to the rim into the basket you got to separate so thats what happens though Dave you play a lot of new lineups guys that arent used to playing these are adjustments that they just dont solve overnight I dont think this five has been on the court together this year for Stanford until tonight first free throw good Im not sure they were on together much in practice let alone the game but here it is you can see the replay that just you got to see man and ball you cant face guard your that close to the basket you kind of got to watch the Flight of the ball and a Defender just completely lost sight of the ball and I think that there was a quick substitution following that last play Reno back in Chisum oara whos been dealing with his own shoulder issue youll see the athletic tape sort of supportive tape around his left shoulder hes in for the first time a transfer from Harvard who was one of the best players in the Ivy League last year that pass werent exactly sure who that was for now Agarwal tried to shovel it to Young and it went right through his legs and out of B yeah Im a little surprised Dave I mean agaro was point blank to the rim he could have taken it up for a foul or a basket a little bit too unselfish again though different guys playing different roles and their different strategies so theyre going to have to adjust no point guard no backup point guard for Stanford theyre down their top two options at the one spot Johnson had his pass deflected but got it back now feeds to Reed right back to Johnson for three no good Reed on the offensive glass and a jump off Arrow does favor weight EV Stinson was not going to let that ball go now both teams fired up you can see Stanford you know showing a lot of emotion over there theyre you know theyre rooting each other on again a short bench on both ends but Stanford with a lot of new players um you know you got to get out there and you can see here the play nice challenge by raino but you got to secure the defensive boards we saw Tony Pilla the lead official tonight talking to the teams after that challenged three good what a shot from Cameron Hil who then oh yeah went right to the Stanford bench and I think he got called for a technical he did he he was going to let the Stanford bench know that that hes not aable that that that shots available and hes going to knock it down uh I love the confidence but you got to kind of leave it alone there uh there it is its there was a message delivered and I get officials decided to deliver a message of their own what a shot from hildr whos having a heck of a first half Reno whos been eerily quiet that is his first point of the game the leading scorer in the ACC hard to score points Dave when youre playing point guard so hes going to have to get back on the Block down there and have to share the wealth a little bit but you know he wont be quiet for long hes a team guy not a selfish player I think he can put up bigger numbers than he does but he does it all for this team I mean it is true tonight hes often bringing the ball up the court and most possessions hes sort of playing top of the circle free throw line area initiating the offense yeah and he initiates a lot here he is again he initiates a lot usually on the Block but hes up top a lot too screening stepping back threat from three and and delivering passes trying to hit his teammate cutting to the bucket that was not a great pass yeah and a Stanford turnover hildr out into the open in attack mode scores again hes on fire you can see his aggression both at the rim and from the perimeter hes really playing at a high level 13 points already oara almost had it taken away Reno Baseline double teamed found oara who hesitated shoots it three I love the confidence oakar to knocked that shot down Stanfords got to find some guys now that arent bashful theyve got to step up but as you mentioned you know different lineups different attack methods def def I I dont doubt that hes looking for shots now he slipped avoided the turnover and gets fouled at the very end of kind of an awkward scenario well you can see wake four is running the floor in transition and thats putting your head down and getting to the rim you got to get back in transition but heres aara said you know what youre not going to guard me Im going to knock that down so showing his ability to step out usually hes an inside attack player what a half for Cameron hildr the senior from England whose father played for the NBA head coach Nick nurse Nick nurse and Steve Forbes wakes head coach are very close friends and Nick nurse called Steve Forbes years ago and said hey one of my former players has a kid super tough player I think you should take a look at him and he was he was the number one player in England in his class played on a bunch of the British national teams and hes had an excellent career well great story and again relationships relationships relationships paid off Big Time averaging 13 a game hes already got 15 Reno way too strong on the three attempt and I dont blame him for looking for a shot hes not had many chances to score in this first Applause half hriff three no that was a heat check first time he didnt really get a good score up uh shot to the basket Agarwal just did not deliver a very good pass Reno attacks hell go to the free throw line well I love Maximo ability to stretch the floor youve got to guard him from three so you rush his threepoint shot and he just beat you off the dribble with vengeance I mean thats just a shot fake uhuh and then he gets the rim he had thoughts of knocking it down and he took a pretty good shot on that possession but hell hell settle and go to the line I dont think hell mind making a living here two one two got up sort of dusted himself off took a little inventory well you know well probably take a look at a graphic later da but you know Maxim Reno has only gone to line three times a game in the ACC now hes gone there about eight times during the regular season nonc conference so its been quite a discrepancy once youve gotten into the league play I think the messages lets get there more I mean those those numbers by the way those are in all of college basketball a top 10 scorer a top five rebounder nobodys had more double doubles nobody in the sport than this young man well he was the most improved player in the Pack 12 last year and he Im not so sure hes not one of the more improved players this year from last year to this so hes shown the ability to get better every year hes played and hes a math major how about that I got a chance to spend some time with his family during the year and great family from Paris theyre theyre up watching the game three in the morning they never take theyre up live Reed to Harris in the lane that ball ripped out of bounds but a foul call so Juke Harris The Freshman from the state of North Carolina we going to the free throw line he did a good job Dave of really showing and exposing the ball in his arms and making you take a piece of them going up thats really smart play when youre in traffic go up with your elbows out and make your opponents take a piece of your arm dont expose the ball wake thrown a lot of fouls already nine team fouls against Stanford that free throw no good next Wednesday in the ACC Stanford against a good really very solid Georgia Tech Team seven Eastern and then Cooper flag leads Duke against Cal at Cameron indor so Stanford and Cal are headed back East once again catch both those games next Wednesday on the ACC Network in the ESPN app I never got a chance coaching atal to play Duke I did it when I was at Eastern Michigan but at Cal now thats new territory both stford Cal going out to play the likes of North Carolina and very memorable game in Cal history from the NCA tournament Jason kid Absol that was uh that was that was a game heard around the world uh put Cal on the map that year very memorable game between these two in the NCA tournament many years ago first time that Stanford and wake ever played yeah it was a big win for the by the Cardinal its a very talented demon team the last game of Tim Duncans great wake for his career agar wall contested jump shot way short well that just was not a very good offensive possession for Stanford Kyle Smith looks disturbed by that one we got a good game here at Maples 749 to go first half tied at 25 Music Music to around question is about Ed tuer who the first ever African player for mens basketball and the question basketball sc4 B 1950 C4 basketball Music Applause A50 deth his first scor points and the g winner you just hit the g winner right here congratulations foron Music Music one of the most memorable games the most memorable between these two teams Stanford awake back in 1997 Tim Duncan the national college player of the year that year but it would turn out to be his final game in a wake for his uniform in the round of 32 brevan Knight second team AllAmerican one of the alltime greatest Stanford players 7266 the final score Tim Young Peter sour Arthur Lee and Company ended the weight career of Tim Duncan went to the Sweet 16 yeah thats saying something thats the same year as C we did and I can tell you this I coached against that team they were they were troubled re Knight was a load Mike Montgomery one of his better teams hes coach here I think the pack 10 that year had four sweet 16 teams and the ultimate National Champion the last AR finished from the league to win the national title the now gone packed 12 Reno gets fouled by epon Reed that was a memorable year but I you look back uh dve and uh that was a big time win because wake bis was good they were loaded and Stanford was able to get it there and and get that win Advance this week 16 so big time win painful loss for wake in their history second foul against Reed he stays in the game wake back up by two its been a back and forth half sellers attacks no whistle now a whistle yeah a late call late call but I like the call because there was some contact boy that shot goes down that would have brought the house down they look at the cut Stanford doing a great job against pressure basket cutting and I mean thats just you know thats what you do against pressure you attack the basket and Maxim Reno and Company doing a good job of finding guys cutting I mean he could have Reno officially has two assists he could have about five if his teammates were finishing a little more effectively around the rim Im with you I I dont know if he gets to do be too good at this he may find himself playing more outs hes done it all for this team but you got to when youre a guy down youve got to make some adjustments I love the effort by Stanford theyre theyre not feeling sorry for themselves theyre playing now theyre Zone theyre playing their Zone 1 through1 match up Zone been effective hildr tried to love pass and it worked wasnt perfect but Trayvon spillers really good athlete caught it and dunked it now theres a weak spot in Zone because you got Reno in the middle of the 131 along the Baseline at The Rim Early is where you want to attack that zone couple more offensive possessions like that and Stanford may not be playing much more of that sers got cut off and he traveled yeah good defense by wake for but lets lets take a look at that attack on the other end you get raino in the middle but they just went over the top and along the Baseline only one Defender and usually your smallest Defender is defending along the back line of that Z defense smart play play by hildr didnt have to be perfect just get it somewhere in the neighborhood now now youll see Stanford go back theyll show Zone and the go back man good call by Kyle Smith mix it up Reed backing his way in against Reno elevates fouled well there was some bumping going on before the foul call I think the official said you know I got to call that one with the body a little bit but Renos good enough Maxi Reno good enough to play oneonone in the post you usually dont need to bring a double team hes done a good job this year of staying out of foul trouble and using his 7 fo 7 fo one frame to defend Stanford missing some of his best players and now piling up the fouls Reed makes the first of two double bonus for the final 625 of the first half for the Demon Deacons yeah thats a long stretch to go with the double bonus and dont think Quake Forest doesnt know that they going to be every opportunity trying to get to that foul line it was a first foul against Reno who was in big time foul trouble in the first match up between these two teams well in the good news for stanfords they can play zone theyve got it in their Arsenal KY Smiths always employ employed Zone defenses so theyll mix it up if they have to theyll go back in the zone Reed made of both he goes to the bench wakes got a fivepoint lead Stanfords gone cold on offense they havent made a shot from the field in three minutes and theyre won for their last eight shooting from the floor just good wake Force defense sellers Johnson glued to Music Applause him ready know double team comes immediately passes over the top now young down low no ball in and out and another shot from close range it didnt go down yeah Point Blank we just you talked about it a second ago theyve missed a ton of those Hunter Salis wake hasnt needed much from him there goes Johnson dishes it back up top Harris in and out good look missed the shot I love it Maxim r no says go down FL I got this 7 foot one point guard his new Music rle agar wall extra pass sellers wide open Corner three no this a guy shooting 50 from threepoint range in conference play and nobody was guarding it yeah good look Johnson goes to the bucket missed the shot and a fight for the rebound theyre going to call I believe Jaylen Thompson of Stanford for the foul well josah sers can get good looks from three youll take it because hes torching the net from the threepoint line this year Stanford doing a good job rotating but now as you said Dave theyre really creating a a a deficit here for themselves and this in this end theyre putting Wake Forest to the line theyre shooting bonus the rest of the way theres a ton of time left in this half so its JW Carris The Freshman whos been a much bigger part of this team I think that they expected at the start of the Year makes the first of his two free throws head coach Steve Forbes done a really good job with this program his fifth year all of a sudden Steves one of the The deans of the ACC coaching ranks how about that I mean some of the departures obviously some coaches stepping down in the last year or two and now Steve forb still holding down the fort Reno snatches down the rebound Stanfords got to get the offense going oiah sers especially with no jayen blanks 0 for four from the field 0 for three from three thats been hard for Stanford to get into Rhythm offensively agar wall gets fouled by Johnson trying to post him up so thats going to be free throws for Ryan agarwall I like that approach when youre struggling you got new lineup on there and youve got some mismatches on the floor da go to the block create some chances for yourself go go to go inside you can heres that mismatch you got a smaller guard guarding the the taller Ryan agar wall thats good strategy and you saw Tyler Johnson arguing with the official he might have had a little bit of a point agar wall might have had a piece of that Jersey and now he misses the front end of the free throw so Stanford just has gone ice cold on offense after a really nice nice start Salis step back three no offensive rebound shot blocked jump ball so Spillers snatched it went up to Duncan and Donovan young got a piece thatll give the ball back to Stanford good break for Stanford but you know you can see uh the play the ball goes up and heres just a clean ball good call by the officials play on I mean Stanford now has yet another player in the in the lineup for them Anthony Batson Junior so theyre theyre playing on their bench theyre exhausting everybody they have into this game to try to get a rhythm and and overcome the deficit theyre playing against some guys who just have not played very many minutes at all this year including the guy whos got the ball right now Batson raino is screaming at some of his teammates I think to start moving bad pass stolen by Salas wake might have an advantage Salis on the attack and a blocking foul Batson commits the foul well he took the charge Dave the question is was he inside the the circle the ark and he took it flush but I have a feeling theyre going to say he was inside and theyre also counting the basket theyre saying goal Char all day yeah Im not so sure Dave I thought that Batson was outside of the the cylinder there and I mean and the other thing is Young touched it after it had touched the backboard it looked like yep so they called the goal count the basket plus the foul and theyre going to the monitor so well see what happens okay well well let Tony Padilla take a look sort it out and then well come back here to Maples Pavilion where Wake Forest has taken control of this game 419 to go in the first half they lead standord 3426 Music on Music w Music Music every Music Music Music gotcha well the wak Force defense is started to take over this game yeah it is you can see the delayed double team on the dribble causing the Maxine raino turnover now we dont get back in transition Stanford so now youre there and you try to take the charge but youre moving slightly and you give up the offensive goon so a chance for a threepoint play on a tough play a tough turnover by Stanford you give the Demon Deacons a lot of credit for the Havoc theyre creating on the defensive side Stanfords got four assists and seven turnovers in this first half well and again you know we mentioned that Stanford playing without their point guards but its the deakon demon deons that are disrupting theyre a much improved defensive team this is one of Steve Forbes better defensive teams and San missing some shots that they normally would make add it all up and wakes got their biggest lead 3526 Stanford started seven of 11 theyre one for their last 10 Batson nice attack he missed the shot from close range but he does on the second effort draw a foul well that showed you his aggressiveness because he stayed with it he got point blank to the rim again and missed it but he was had presence of mind to chase his own shot and put it right back up theres a sweep in the drive great opportunity avoid the Defenders get to the rim good job he beat the best wake defensive player Cameron hildr whos been awesome in this first half its the first point for Stanford in a while Anthony Batson is a good looking freshman hasnt played a ton this year but hes got some ability he had scored a total on the year not per game not per month a total of 13 points now not many but hes hes perfect from the line hasnt missed a free throw all year now a kickball but if youre Stanford and youre now trying to play the final four minutes of this half youve got to solve two things one you got to solve the foul issue because you cant continue to put WG Forest at the line and two you got to find a way to get your Rhythm offensively because they have not been able to get in their rhythm Music Applause Johnson drives Down the Lane Johnson tough shot ball tipped out of bounds itll go back to Stanford good Hustle by Juke Harris to help his teammate up yeah I love it thats thats good teamwork its being a good teammate dont leave your guy just sitting there on the floor no no its rule number one I like Stanford now going toah oseas sers as the point guard let Reno operate close to the basket get some foul calls and make them double him for some open looks sers good pass Grant open three no I dont think Stanford hes a walk on but Stanfords very confident in his shooting ability Salas thought about the three now drives and draws contact against young another whistle thats a clever clever move by Hunter Sal as you could see there wasnt much there but watch his body control you know he goes from really creating his own shot to spin he knows hes got his opponent lunging and he waits for him to come down and draws a foul good play yep Savvy from the young man who was such a heralded high school player went to Gonzaga with a lot of fanfare and had some moments with the zags on some really good Gonzaga teams but never played a whole lot has really found a home at Wake Forest has had two excellent years and finishing his weight career with a bang hes hes put up some numbers this year a one of two free throws and hell come out preseason First Team all League player Hunter sales Parker Frederickson we talk about how thin Stanford is but really the bench is even shorter for Wake Forest no Devin Cosby no Omaha beloo both players not playing again tonight they play seven pretty much every game Batson again with the drive Batson back to the free throw line well he a guy who has hardly played at all this year hes given Stanford a nice little spark Off the Bench No Lack of confidence by The Freshman I loved it Maxim Reno there to Pat his freshman teammate on the back say keep it going but I I love it I you got to be aggressive Dave and and if you can just get to the rim you got abilities look hes drawing fouls you can get two points at the foul line every time thats getting it done theyve missed some shots but I love getting to the foul line well thats what jayen blanks does so well for this Stanford team and and hes not playing tonight so thats in trying to fill that role now Blakes just incredible uh his ability to get to the line almost at will so theyre they are missing not only their point guard ability playmaking ability best defender and the guy that the end of the shot clock always gives you some dividends okay thats a long list of things in what else can you for me but I like Jaylen Blakes talked to before the game Dave hes there hes rooting on his teammates he knows hell get back in Action soon but hed love to be on the floor but you got to help your team and hes trying to help them from the bench theyre hoping to have him back on Saturday NC State will be here Spillers against Rayo scores I love his ability just to go over his shoulder even against the seven with what one Maxim REO whos trying to avoid you know fouls so thats a smart play played against wake in the NIT last year for App State and Steve Forbes Id like to have that guy well he got him and they recruited him and hes having a really good year oara down low got cut off finds Batson Oar up top another shot fake Stanford drives to the bucket and scores and he can do that Dave he really attacks the B basket chisim moara did it when he was at Harvard hes doing it for the Cardinal right now he can he can drive it average 16 points a game last year in the ivy league Johnson falls down and they call a foul so I guess he got tripped it almost almost looked from here although there was a lot of traffic that he just sort of tripped himself well he he did lose his footing the question is did he lose it with some help or just on a slip yeah I think he might have just fallen over the shoes of Chisum oakar I dont know that the shoes could commit a foul but it looks like in the eyes of the officials there was some contact I dont think it was directed I think a good break for w Forest maybe the ball doesnt lo I know thats what the students behind us say maybe with some other words mixed in second free throw also no good they really saying it all right well play on no harm no foul now you see wake going to his Zone Dave they a little bit of foul trouble right they were almost daring REO to shoot hell noell no sers has been so quiet only three points in this first half extra pass raino three go you cant leave him there he will torch you from three and you normally dont go out and guard a sevenfooter at the threepoint line but he does it well stord making a little push here at the end of the half pass not a shot that was a pass and not a great one for mild great job by Maxim REO he read the defender he watched his eyes the entire possession to make that steal a car down low backing his way in good hands by Johnson to knock it out of bounds and Dave what Wake Forest is doing is hes theyre doing a good job doubling off the dribble but you see Maxim Reno why the pro Scouts like his game I mean he just like its nothing knocks down shots from three and hes confident thats the sevenfooter lets go baby just has a beautiful shooting and scoring touch Reno catch thought about Music it clock winding down along the Baseline got tripped up and did he call a timeout no he was out of bounds so thats a turnover yeah thats unfortunate because he just before he was about to make his move trying to save The Possession theres only going to be two seconds left anyway so have to regroup theyre going back on defense short timeout back to Maples right after this Music Applause final 55 seconds of this first half Wake Forest looking for a major road win the Demon Deacons right in the mix of the conversation for the NCA tournament right in the upper echelon of the ACCC for that matter so its Stanford their first year in this conference seven and four weat elad has been as nine just a few minutes ago Stanfords cut it to three but wakes got the ball with 55 seconds left now its a big match up you know its a situation a lot of teams go two for one day see if Wake corus gets the early shot or just plays it all the way through Harris against young initiating that contact no whistle ball tipped around snatched away little jump stop and the bounce pass goes goes out of bounds off of Stanford thats good call lets see they going reverse it nope Kyle Smith pleading officials telling coach Smith coach give me a little room now I need some room to operate theres a seat over there just take it C very emotional this game he wants this game badly da 15 seconds to shoot saved in bounds which you appreciate the effort just not a great play by Batson now you throw that out of bounds thats just a fresh mistake youre taught in an early age C yo bbo dont save it under your own basket hes playing really hard in this first half but that was a play that benefited weight Stanford looking for the final shot they Blitz sers Reno couple of dribbles with the left hand how about that one hes ambidextrous and it pays off Max Team REO big basket to get a little momentum going back led by nine Stanford cut into that lead DEA deacons have theall we start the second half this is an important 20 minutes for both teams Johnson goes downhill and tried to find Hunter Sal ball went through his hands a great opening possession for the Cardinal themselves defensively suers back to rno another one of those Runners this one a little too strong yeah in between there I thought thats a shot he can make he made it to close the half but a little bit off balance Salis from the free throw line came up short Reed offensive rebound Applause B offensive rebounding helped the Cardinal they struggled to shoot for a lot of that first half this time wake with the second chance opportunity no good very good defense by Hosea sers with some help from the center Maxim raino heres raino back to the point guard 71 point guard here it is weve seen it a lot tonight ran agarwall struggled at times I think in that first half lines up the three hits it must have heard you Dave Fleming wow and he heard you because he showed no hesitation and said you know what Im a good freeo shooter Im going to shoot it with confy thats a big basket big time his second three of the game and Stanfords tied it up Sal Baseline scores well you think youre guarding him as osiah salers thought he was but youve got to do more than just put a hand out you got to put it up and really make it tough on him sers kicks it into the corner and now HR there to steal it away agar wall they call that open court foul the intentional foul no play on the ball yeah you got to let that go as much as its tempting to slow it down the NBA thats an automatic stop and just a foul and no no free throws in college basketball you put two hands on your opponent on a breakaway uh thats a no no and so uh there going to get burned for the uh for the foul yeah I mean it the spirit of the rule definitely is not a play like that I mean theres hardly any contact at all but it is the rule well its a breakaway rule too so uh its there for a reason you you dont want to impede a player whos got a breakway the basket otherwise everybody would do it so understand the rule but unfortunately Stanford turns it over and now commits the the foul and gives up three Cameron hild he misses that second one he is playing so well hes had a really good year hes got 16 of wakes 43 points hes been sort of the Havoc Creator on defense Demon Deacons keep the ball back up by three after Stanford tied it just a moment Applause Music ago Johnson finds Reed who got stopped at The Rim got his own Miss now Johnson Three Way Off the Mark Ball KP back again Johnson pass deflected and stolen away well thats a good opportunity for Stanford to stay with it theyve got offensive rebounds they gave up but they stayed with it defensively and now they came up with the Music possession team that thats been a part of this game plan defensively for Wake here comes another one sers pull up jumper too strong and good job by the Demon Deacons again just disrupting Stanford and doubling yep thats good Applause defense Spillers elevates no good goes to the free throw line hes done a nice job this game they just getting to the basket with either hand and drawing fouls and and so thats been a a really good attack mode for Wake Forest theyre not a great threepoint shooting team so theyre going to attack you off the dribble here it is theres a spin into the paint and just you know getting your Defender behind you and going over the shoulder hes just a good player makes the first of two free throws Trayvon pillars play six seven but he rebounds a little under t a game I mean hes hes able to get your boards hes a double figure scorer so uh and he blocks shots for you so hes hes a big part of this G made them both lead back to five Spiller now in double figures with 10 well the problem is raino brings it up and hes pretty solid with the ball but then when he gets it back its kind of hard hes going to have to get some guys you know to give it up and get it back Thompson on the attack missed it right at the rim and now lost out of bounds its a break for Stanford Johnson had it was starting to look up court and just lost it along the sideline yeah you know I love Maxim raino he went right over to his freshman uh and and and Jaylen Thompson and he just said look this stop where I excuse me and said look you know keep your head up keep attacking its going to pay off I I love that about Max hes a team player and hes a guy that can motivate his teammates that was a good move just didnt finish no and he said keep doing it now a whistle and a foul against hildr trying to defend the inbound and K Smith finally giving the officials a little bit of evation getting the crowd behind him now thats a big call thats his third personal well and thats what kle Smith would like to do is try to accumulate some fouls themselves getting a bonus and keep some of their key players with seven players on a rotation you got to get some of these guys in foul trouble wake drew a ton of fouls against Stanford in that first half more of this defense just swarming flying all over the there seemed like theres six seven guys on defense for Wake Forest theyre everywhere oara elevates and hits a three well thats one way to bail out a possession a chisar has shown his ability now to knock down frees he wasnt buying any three point shots early in the season hes definitely got his percentage up his percentage up Karen Reed to shoot hes wide open hes not going to sh stord going underneath ball screens for the most part Salis finds Reed and an offensive foul Thompson there to draw the charge well I love his sophomore from Oakland putting his signature on this game and his teammates giving him an ovation giving up his to get the ball back for the Cardinal he had three personal fouls in the first half which limited his minutes when hes been on the floor hes done some good things for a guy whos hardly played at all this year now and they have to play some guys that havent loged minutes uh players you know we talked about this Dave they dont when a guys down they dont care as much as coaches in the media they they just want an opportunity to play and show what they can do agarwall trying to step through the double team theyre desperately trying to get the ball to REO on the Block but hes just getting double every possession see if sellers can create something still trying to get it in there to him finally they do R scor it took a while I dont know how chisar got it through the defense on that pass but REO with the snatch and the score that ties the game once again Reno has 11 Salos free throw line good he loves that spot on the course but hell quiet the crowd in any Arena the way he plays offensively gets his own shot goes up high off the off of his uh the leap and he can get the ball down and and under yeah thats just the second possession here in this second half how do you defend that well oneonone its hard you have to bring a second Defender Dave AAR had it Stripped Away thats a turnover hriff got cut off by Reno Salis in the corner falls down aara did not travel raino behind the back sellers s Reno puted it in with a Applause foul Andrew Luck he hes a guy who knows something about passing it doesnt he oh my goodness much a sequence Dave here it is the ball on the floor raino the slight of hand behind the back sellers no but Reno yes the putback and a foul chance for threepoint play Music Music going tonight thank app e these programs in their history have a great childrens wake has Rand off Stanford has Josh the pack 10 player of the year 2003 2004 I would argue maybe the greatest dunker most explosive athlete that Stanfords ever had Dave I can vouch for that now I was standing sitting across the way in and the opposing bench and I remember this bouncy floor he didnt need the bouncy floor he went up over the top played at the top of the backboard a truly great player for Stanford best friends with Jamal Samson that played our Center Cal and Ill tell you jam I mean Josh childr just got it done he was a tremendous player and even a better person just great sport he dunked on your team a lot yeah s yeah thanks and every team you remember and every team every team thank you he dunked on Arizona too in UCLA wasnt particular I can tell you that REO but played in the NBA and dunked in a few teams in the NBA as well so Stanfords got his first lead in a while back ahead 4847 Al overall its the 10th lead change we had a back and forth first half until wake started to separate late in the half now good defense from Thompson but the great shooting touch hildr is just on fire tonight well how good is he been Dave he can get his own shot he can score in transition hes strong hes resilient he doesnt mind taking some punishment getting if youre into his body hes drawn six fouls so all the other stuff that hes done hes drawn six fouls by himself oara down low no good ball tipped out of bounds off of r no that chis had a chance to draw some some uh contact there but you can see here again look at the maneuver ability he gets bumped once and just gets his own shots separates a tremendous oneonone player and like you say get gets to the foul line hes gotten there regularly this year that was good defense Now Thompson trying to guard Salis Salis elevates gets another one he shoots the ball over outstretched hands he went over two Defenders and just made it look easy hes smooth those are two big time buckets from hildr and Hunter Salis so wakes back up by three Thompson with the left hand no tried to follow his own Miss fell to the ground no whistle Here Comes wake with the ball Applause Johnson from the free throw line to Applause strong raino not a great pass anticipated by Johnson he steals it away and hell lay it in well theres the double team and K Smith calls it immedate timeout wants to make some adjustments again Wake Forest with the double team off the dribble off the catch theyre theyre taking care of it this has been one of the stories of this game forcing turnovers on the defensive end capitalizing on the offensive end six nothing run wake for is back ahead Applause Music Music Music this is an ESPN Sonic Blockbuster this is star power from the jump number two Duke Clemson Saturday on ESPN e e and Sonic Blockbuster this is star power from the jum number two Duke Clemson Saturday on ESPN its big game in the ACC Saturday game time a little adjusted 630 Eastern on ESPN dick vital is going to be there Cooper flag has been so good Maxim R know leading this league in scoring but Cooper flags been awesome H Salis fourth in the league in points per game those two on the floor here tonight for an important ACC game and a little push from Wake six nothing run wake for is back ahead Kyle Smith making an adjustment to his lineup oara swarm down low instead of passing scores that had to come right out of that timeout the message was simple guys dont settle dont throw it away dont give it to the guys in the dark uniforms take it to the rim and they did our car has been good four or five shooting hes got 10 now heres Salas whos really started to turn it up here in the second half has made some big time shots hriff down low and a kind of weird shot from Spillers off the front iron no he rushed it you know but the sevenfooter has you rushing shots and Maxim Rs presence is felt big man to Big Man Reno travel well the immediate double team the double teams coming from different spots Dave its sometime off the catch sometimes its off the dribble that kind time it came from the Baseline side so I mean you can see uh they forced some baseline that double team came from the Baseline side four or five different kinds of double teams tonight and Maxim Rs got to pay attention to that well theyre asking him to do a lot tonight with no point guard but hes got five of Stanfords 13 turnovers Salis three in and out nice challenge by Max Stanford talked today in their practice about singled digigit turnovers that was a big goal for the game already have 13 Reno over the top three ball tipped back Batson The Freshman who gave some quality minutes in the first half tipped it to sers sers has been real quiet a car hes been the effective guy here in the last few minutes sellers Baseline good and Dave he can do that hes got a way to separate hes hes had games where hes carried this team hes going to have to get aggressive coming down the stretch of this game he hes had a great year just hasnt shot the ball particularly well tonight thats his first field goal made in the game Johnson three good the answer on this side for the Demon Deacons big basket huge basket by Tyler Johnson as you mentioned isah sers hes going to hes an unselfish player might have to get a little more selfish Reno picked up his dribble hildr in a tussle with camon and Tony Padilla calls the foul that if thats against HTH I assume it is thats a huge call and and you know what he caught a call c three fouls on that possession thats his fourth person yeah and and hes got to hes got to play a little restriction but uh interesting down the stretch now your best scorer on the bench with four thats a problem for Wake Forest they do lead by 4 1051 to go Music from Applause Music e what is Black History Month black history always Stanford uh with some warmup shirts during the pregame to celebrate Black History Month Stanfords got a uh a legacy of a great Pioneer part of their basketball history sebran Tucker the first black student athlete at Stanford led the basketball team in scoring two different seasons in the early 50s Black History Month black history always here in February Stanford and Wake Forest almost halfway through the second half its been a back and forth kind of game wakes back up by Music four Batson shot clock windy down goes Baseline and reverses it in thats a great individual move by the freshman nothing seemed to be there but he took Baseline and hit the reverse off hand Kyle Smith trying to buy a minute or two with Maxim Reno on the bench Cameron hildr meanwhile on the bench for Wake now with four fouls hes been awesome tonight Johnson passed up a three get cut off at the basket missed the layup second chance for Wake Forest the three in and out no good did everything but go down for Juke Harris thats a good defensive possession for Stanford agar wall goes to the rim agar wall spins it home to tie the game well how about Stanfords aggression to the basket they theyve decided were not going to settle for threes we are going to attack the rim and Steve Forbes has to burn a timeout so backto back possessions without raino on the floor getting buckets to tie this game and his last time it was Ryan agerwal now I love Ryan agerwals aggressiveness he splits two Defenders he gets to the rim and hes got the English counted Applause Music big day of college basketball on Saturday two great matchups to kind of headline it number one Auburn hosting number six Florida four Eastern on ESPN 2 you got Cooper flag and number two Duke taking on Clemson 630 you got a former Pack 12 School Arizona hosting Texas Tech thats a really good game late at night on Saturday Wake Forest called timeout and now turns it over Reno back in the game tipped it away here comes Stanford Batson finds Reno passed up the three and got fouled I like the discipline by Stanford he Maxim Reno could have pulled the three but he got his defender in the air he drew yet another foul these fouls are adding up and putting Stanford now going to be in the bonus but how about Stanford they theyve been down theyre down a couple of guys but they played 10 guys tonight and wakes only played Seven so you know the advantage now is going to stand for like getting a chance to use their Music depth Aiden camman younger big man who can play alongside Reno theyre both on the court at the same time right now shot clock down to nine Reno long three to strong rebound Applause Music wake def defense defense Sal Batson played good defense on him Frederickson almost lost Music it lets see if sales can create little crossover hits a three and they say its a long two foot was on the line what a shot though again from 100 Sal David you Dave you asked me earlier what can you do against him not much I mean thats just oneonone Im going to get my shot off and and not much you can do about it big time Reno skips it into the corner sellers three go now thats a maxim REO pass now out of a double team when hes squared up he can see the whole floor better than when his back is turned great look by rho to his teammate sellers thats a good point A lot of times hes had to maneuver back to the basket from a long way out I think that was a coaching point from his staff on the on on the you know on the bench square up and you can see your targets now an offensive foul Reed that was an illegal screen I think it was a good call thats his fourth personal as I said the fouls are going to mount up and if youre awake youve been playing on a short bench youve got seven guys that are awfully good but they have not gone to their bench much and heres a little bit of an extra movement at the end if he just stays solid stay stationary theres no no foul there yeah theres just no reason to do it the officials standing right there youre asking to get called for that agar wall raino down low cam lays it in another great pass from the big man yeah hes still playing point forward hes still getting his ability to see the floor Stanford now trying to separate Stanfords biggest lead in this game has been four theyre up Applause three Re down low trying to clear out spin move had his shot blocked no a foul left Reed will go to the free throw Applause line but first a timeout here at Maples hes a passer too yeah you like skilled players how about Maxim REO he can knock down threes he can get to the rim but he can give you a couple of Dimes as in to his teammates your know Music here Music last Music Music Music well is still a huge need for the folks down in Southern California help people affected by the California wildfires donate at redcrossorg ESPN help the Red Cross respond and help people recover so many people that I know so many Stanford alums affected by those fir so we still need your help were going to need your help for many more years to come redcrossorg ESPN we appreciate any support you can provide good game here at Maple 6158 Stanford under eight to play Reed at the free throw line and hes been good at the line tonight hes knocking down those shots and you know hes hes a guy that can get there hes Bigs strong if youre Stanford now you want to continue coming back against Great Forest because you got them in foul trouble you can stay in the bonus that was Stanford we talked about their bench their SC out scored Lake for is 20 to2 Off the Bench pretty amazing some unlikely sources of those 20 points I didnt see that coming reeds in the game with four fouls Cameron hildr on the bench with four fouls game changed when he had to go to the bench sers elevates in and out no good yeah its a good look by hell take that shot anytime just couldnt get it to good out wake ball down Music Applause one Salis throws up a l great pass and Spillers finishes well you you trying to get a stop on obviously on you know and you just give up the dunk to the rim what a great look by Hunter Silas now Stanford down low R gets fouled by Salis trying to help out with the defense prevent the layup what a nice play on the other end but but they look at the drive youre youre going to challenge up so you challenge but you give up the rim and you dont expect that but what a you know what a great look from H Salis for his teammate to a dunk and now you got Maxi Reno whos now operating along the basket on the Baseline drawing fouls I I think Stanford found something here he may be able to get some free throw attempts by attacking inside goes without saying all these are important R now front end makes it tie game again 633 to go now we talked about his only averaging three three throw attempts a game in the in the ACC and and theres making an effort to get back there this game baby hes not in a rush at the line it takes his time well hes got a good touch now if youre Stanford you got to do something with Hunter sales hes been a Applause problem Reed sets the screen for Salis again loves that area of the Court free throw line This Time sort of swarmed gets out of trouble shot clock at 10 now R steals the pass fillers trying to find Reed and the big man brings it up the court himself down low oara shot fake good great ball Movement by Stanford they found open guys they got double passed out of it and they found of power whos having a game bab he really is inside 12 points five of six shooting Sal slipped again wow looked like he traveled he did a Stanford turning the table now and theyre putting on some defense of their Applause own r no in this passing lane anticipates and then he comes down the floor and finds his teammate tiso par at The Rim so Stanford ahead by three with the ball raino has been a passer hes been a scorer Cameron hildr back in the game with four fouls thats big for Wake raino open three way off the mark and hriff immediately grabs a rebound and gets fouled man Maxim REO doesnt miss like that very often that was a good look no he was wide open and I I mean that would have again shaken up this home crowd hes human Cameron hildr he left the game wake was up by four he comes back in the game theyre down three they missed him well they did and now theyve got the the double dynamic duo and theyve got Salis and Ed down low Reed under the bucket another foul against Stanford and Fon Reed back to the free throw line yeah Stanfords got to find a way Dave to play inside out because again you know not the strong suit for Wake fourest to knock down threes but theyre finding a way to get into the into the paint to the rim and Stanford now starting to accumulate fouls themselves these These are big minutes for both sides you can see the anguish on the face of the Stanford head Applause coach Reed makes the first of two Thursday Prime Time womens college basketball matchups you got number five Yukon number 19 Tennessee great traditional rivalry on the womens side 630 Eastern then St for Notre Dame 830 Notre Dame top five team thats Thursday on ESPN second one from Reed and perfect at the line be interesting to see Dave if Stanford goes out Cameron Hil whos got for two players on the court for Wake with four fouls oara posting up very active night for him Chisum oara spins back back and a travel yeah that looked awkward Im not sure that PPP feet move but the move is a little Herky jerky officials right on it and you can see yep he lifted his pivot pushes right on that good call heres Salis driving Salis contested short Reed offensive rebound yeah again Stanford giving up the offensive rebound been a big story in the second half hildr spins it in along the Baseline Wake Forest Back ahead by one hes picking up where he left off theres no lack of confidence that young mans game Big Time game for him hes got 20 osiah sers Batson wide open in and out on the three Salis long distance path and hildr will reset was just a different team with number six out there well they theyve got some weapons now they you just cant play off a guys you got to play this Music team Johnson was falling down flung a shot up to avoid the turnover yeah and Stanford was on it Anthony Batsons playing good defense in the half court but he can do that hes a very athletic player sellers oneonone gave it Applause up raino maybe a little reluctant the outside shot hasnt been falling aoll to the basket another assist for maxim Reno well hows that for chemistry those two guys hooked up never lost eye contact and great cut by agal for the two Stanford back up one heres Johnson open three got it wake for its not going anywhere Dave stford trying to separate W say not tonight what a back and forth second half this has become these two teams are battling this game means something 6967 Batson down the lane had it knocked out of bounds no off his Applause leg thats a Stanford Applause Music turnover Max REO look at this eyes are up his teammate in the basket great look for two Music Applause con the roll Music Applause Music well hun Salis has been good Trayvon Spillers has been good the best player on the court tonight for Wake four is Cameron hild yeah hes just had a a whale of a game Dave hes done it from everywhere I mean hes been there defensively able to get the ball out and transition make steals I mean hes able to score it hes also really been a thorn in the Cardinal side because he gets gets to the basket he gets by Defenders he uses either hand and he can score it but hes aggressive hes an aggressive player and he plays with a you know he plays with an edge Dave I mean theres he picked up a technical earlier which was one of his fouls unfortunately but he plays with that kind of confidence and if you want to be good you got have to have that kind of Edge and hes got it four personal fouls including that one you were just talking about hes got the top plus minus number of any player in this game W has outscored Stanford when hes been out the court by nine well theyve got to keep him on the floor and out of the spinal foul heres Salis looking to get it inside hildr goes Baseline reverse no Reed had it had it knocked away and big possession by Stanford and was almost a twopointer by open again thats the 10th rebound for Ros so hes got another one of those double doubles swings the ball over to sers indeed oah sers Stanford does he has had a tough shooting night Applause tonight agar wall drives had his shot blocked finds an open shooter in and out no good rebound knocked around wakes got it yeah couldnt couldnt maintain The Possession that time so wake again with another opportunity to extend under two minutes to go Johnson drives and a bad pass Oar comes away with it Batson got a hand on the ball Oar one on Three scores with the left hand to tie it up again time out Stanford Dave no hesitation from shizar he gets the ball in transition he only knew one way to go thats to the rim and he got there Andrew Luck here cheering on his Cardinal 12th tie of this game I I also give credit this kid Anthony Batson has hardly played this year hes the guy who started that with the deflection on the defensive side no hes been active hes hes a good Defender he just hasnt had a chance to play a lot with Jaylen Blakes playing this year Benny giler as well but Anthony Batson is a fine player and now if youre Stanford you got to find a way you know that youre going to have to defend two guys pretty much Cameron hildr obviously and Hunter Salis so how do you get defend those guys theyre too good oneonone you better have a second Defender waiting in the wings at least to try to get it out of their hands because those two guys can burn its such a big game in conference play got two teams in the upper half of the league its such a big game for both teams NCA tournament hopes jool lardys got W Forest right on the bubble this is just a very big minute 41 seconds now the crowds into this game now to see Stanford players can give them something more to cheer by Sal got bumped draws a foul yeah and again thats a little bit of inexperience if youre a freshman Stanfords still not over the limit but youre going to guard Salis youre going to have to kind of get guys there and play in the space not bump but just take away space more than you try to steals thats his fourth foul bats in yeah thats tough good point you make about that cuz hes been an effective player for them the next foul as you said will put wake in the bonus hild and a foul agarwall got his hand on the ball hildr hit the deck agarwals got to be careful he I thought I thought Ryan aaral did a good job coming up with the ball but officials I think felt he got a little bit more than the ball and heres heres a look heres that crossover you can see it coming out of his hand and theres the ball I think you could see why there might be some contact now the officials correcting saying its a one and one yeah certainly not a two shot foul no so foul trouble on both sides agars got four Batson has for hild free throw good puts wake back ahead hes an excellent free throw shooter hes been around a long time he shot a lot of big free throws in his career no he gets to the line Dave thats one thing hes done all year long 120 plus times so he gets there and he finishes second one also good what a game for him well both these teams you know in foul trouble you think no you play zone but theres too many guys out here you just cant conceive of giving up an open shot theyre going to try to play both teams and make make each team take tough shots tough two probably AAR back in Reno set the screen agarwall kind of picked up his dribble hell get it back agall now drives dishes Batson three short and Salis grabs the defensive rebound and then he gets fouled Kyle Smith desperately wants a traveling Music call P doing a great job on the sideline just calming down you know dont want to call it technical of the game this close really think its a veteran crew when they can talk to you and settle you down not to get emotional back but you see what coach Smith was arguing about I think the foul came before he traveled yeah I think thats what the officials were telling Kyle Smith salz front end good wake for is making its free throws down the stretch well in Stanford you know again weve said this a ton but well say it again theyre playing with key guys out for them and theyre still playing then you can see the call again and maybe maybe KY Smith Point maybe there was a little Shuffle before the contact and then another one after the contact both free throws good and the Demon Deacons at the line back up by four one minute to go well if youre Stanford you got to you got to try to find a way to score maybe stop the clock here camon bounce past Corner sellers three hes just been off the whole game out of bounds off three what a tough tough shooting night for one of the best Shooters in the ACC sellers is two from 10 two for 10 from the field well hes got the ability with his percentages Dave to knock that shot down hes done it all year long uh and hes a good driver but its just been a tough night and again theyre playing without their point guard so theyre you hes used to a point guard setting him up more often and hes getting looks tonight so under a minute they can review who the balls out of bounds off of they ruled it on the court Stanford ball off of re yeah I thought it was but again as the as the rule is you got to have a definite evidence to overturn it it cant be close so unless theres a definitive uh proof there its going to stick with Stanford well that looked to me like it was off read yeah and and again even if its close it stays now youre Stanford youve got time on the clock and youve got a good array of out about plays so you got to try to get something you know to the rim if you can uh and take advantage of maybe uh getting some fouls and and getting back for some free throws well you you you have to the clock is not your friend if youre Stanford so whatever happens well yeah get a get a foul get a a basket or foul and stop the clock if you can if youre Wake Forest your job is to not foul do everything you can give up a an uncont I mean give up a a contested shot if it goes in youre okay youre still up and you got a chance to extend the lead Stanford has one timeout left WG Forest has two timeouts left not sure why this one is taking so long to me that was I thought it was pretty clear it was off of re well there may be a time issue too how much time went off the clock Dave maybe more than that so uh but the officials are doing what they need to do you want to get this right dont give an advantage up but Stanford desperately needs now to to try to get a score on the board and if they can whatever it a look or or a free throw attempt they call floor is can their best bet to the basket this game has been upar hes attacked the rim all game long so dont be surprised if you see him try to get a look to the basket but hes not been a great free throw shooter only thing you dont want to do is turn it over so they did put a little adjustment to the BL yeah thats thats what they were reviewing and the shot clock reset to 20 agarwall trying to get it in raino contested three in and out and a rebound Wake Forest Johnson grabbed it now Stanford at some point theyre going to have to foul and agar wall gets called for the foul thats going to be five against him yeah that thats some fortunate but its too late in the game to worry about preserving fouls you got to you have to stop the clock how about maxing REO that shot was bottom uh and and and if that goes down its a onepoint game it it went down and out in and out wow tough tough play tough look still got a lot of time though Dave in this game plenty of possessions left thats a five foul now youre going to take some time maybe freeze the shooter youre allowed to take some time to sub in it doesnt have to be right away so agar wall that is his fifth foul we thought so and now hell come out I mean you got to give one thing wake Force has done brilliantly down the stretch and they are a good free throw shooting team they have made their free throws and not just one guy everybody no theyve done theyve been outstanding from the line D theyre come on theyre theyre shooting at a high clip for the game almost 90 a little under 90 that one good from Johnson so the lead is now now 7469 you got 433 seconds theres still a lot of time on the clock well you got to race it up you got to get a quick one if youre Big Forest you know youre not going to foul so Stanfords got to know that theyre not going to foul theyre not going to stop the clock youre going to get a chance to get a quick two if you want one under 40 Grant didnt shoot the three Stinson is going to drive and throws up a shot he got fouled and thats what thats what why you drive Dave because thats a foul stops the clock gives Stanford a little break and the chance to make some substitutions so now guys play very few minutes tonight Stinson at the free throw Applause line and who they call that foul on on Wake thats Johnson thats his fifth so thats a factor because hes the guy who gets everybody or well Stanfords going to be able to set up a press and youre right hes your your leader and hes your point guard youre going to have to attack his press without your leader but Stanfords had to do that all game so and without not only their leading point guard their backup point guard theyve been without a point guard on the team all game long what a great effort theyve given us so the Freshman Evan Applause Stinson first of two is good originally committed to play for K Smith at Washington State came here to Stanford I think hes got a chance to be a good player these are maybe the biggest moments of his Stanford career well if youre Stanford you also have to find an option to foul stop the clock and get somebody who has a low percentage if you can get somebody thats not used to making free throws Stinson makes them both I he can set up some pressure you can take a few seconds try to get a steal ultimately though ow the player fell down Salis and then Stinson threw it out of bounds wow what a gift for Wake Salis fell down wake turned it over and then Stanford chucked it out of bounds well I think he saw some guys who were standing up on the Stanford bench as some eligible receivers and I think youre exactly right a couple of St players stood up on the bench yeah and and he saw some white jerseys and and Cal Smiths telling his guys to sit yeah sit Salis gets fouled by Batson thatll be his fifth yeah thats a tough break because you get the steal and now if you can just knock down a shot Force wake to hit some free throws its a different look different game for Miss way for Miss Salis makes another one at the line just clutch from Wake for now theyre theyve been on fire and theyve got a number of guys in that team shooting 80 plus mid 80s upper 80s I mean theyre solid Applause second one good trading points not good enough for Stanford wakes made 25 free throws in the game huge part of the story sers just he has been cut off in this one falls down but theyll call a foul against weight well as I said Dave if youre Stanford you you know you dont need a three you got to get some quick scores on the board youre better driving it because you you know you think a wake doesnt want to foul and give you free throws but uh thats a kind of an inadvertent foul there too dont want to stop the clock if youre awake thats the last thing you want to do yeah that took too much time for Stanford they do get to the line but that took a while well theyre going east west they werent going north south and as I said you put it down you take it the rim I dont think anybodys getting in your way because you Steve Forbes and the staff saying dont foul whatever you do okay then drive it oh God both good for Sellers and out stand for will use its final timeout down four with just under 20 seconds to go yeah and thats a good timeout because you want to do you got to go to your depth chart now and say okay if we dont get the five count we dont get the denial or the quick trap who will we foul you better have a guy in mind thats you know maybe you give up one free throw and get three back so uh all thats going to take place on the sideline during this timeout but the only guy who was out there in those last couple minutes who hasnt been making all of his his free throws down the stretch is the Freshman Juke Harris everybody else for Wake whos been out there has been just money at the free throw line right and you dont always have the luxury of determining who the ball goes into and who youre going to foul sometimes you can foul away from the ball but you got to make sure it doesnt look intentional 12 ties 17 lead changes hildr has been a star for Wake fourest hes had a lot of good games in his career this is one of his best yeah these two teams are battling da I mean seven deep only for Wake four they battled on the road and Stanford I mean they what an effort theyve given you tonight Steve Forbes if his team just takes care of the ball they are in control of this game Stanford needs to create some chaos they need a free throw Miss they need something well they got the steel last time they just happened to throw it to a white jersey that was out of bounds in the a bench player true so here it is theres the full court pressure I think Harris the one guy who has not been making free throws tonight is the inbounder yeah and thats smart if youre wait for us get it out of his hands St sford tries to funnel the ball Salis is just too quick Salis almost had it stolen away Stanford does have to foul at some point they went for a steal Salis flips it under the basket Harris dunks it home now cal Smith really wanted that trampel that hop didnt get it but its IM material now sers flips it up no good loose ball wakes going to watch the final second tick off the clock and the Demon Deacons get a huge Road win now Big Win by wake four as they battled back
