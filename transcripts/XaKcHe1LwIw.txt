and we are about to get underway Georgia wearing their Road black uniforms Florida state in the white for the first time since December 1st 42 years ago Florida State and Georgia playing basketball syas demry Jr right now with the ball Jaylen Delo whose brother is a very talented football player got a big pick against Florida in the starting lineup for Georgia and that is a crash to the floor on a defensive attempt Noah Thomasson who has been really good the last couple of games got it to fall but my goodness jir Watkins really took a hard fall ball fake in the corner get the defender up in the air Landing line left hip there was Watkins but great inside action Inside Out action early Florida state with a brand new player in the lineup Deontay green getting the nod over cam Corin who broke a toe in their last game so its the first career start for Deontay green outside shot taken and missed for this Florida State team that is averaging 83 points per game one of the things Im interesting in tonight is rebound margin theres a straight line drive what a great start for Georgia make your first three and then follow it up with an easy Deuce both of these teams to follow up on my thought negative rebound margins so which team can be a little bit better on the Music Applause glass Darren Green number 22 gets it over to Watkins he decides to take the three and hits it not really known as a threepoint shooter just four for 14 on the season entering tonight yeah just 29 so far but Watkins playing in his first year after a couple of years at Virginia Commonwealth so many new faces really on both teams particularly for Georgia Mike White in his second year trying to Rite the ship good rebound as Watkins shows his athletic ability jir the co ACC player of the week at a double double in the victory against col Colorado to clinch the sunshine slam theres the threepoint shooter green who missed it but the tip in by Green yeah Second Chance opportunities might be there for both teams that shots a little quick and a lot Off the Mark Watkins playing a lot of a lead guard Jaylen warley point guard for this team but youll see the ball in Watkins hands a lot Baba Miller remember that name right cuz a lot of people are excited about this young man theres eight or nine people here tonight that I know are very interested because we have Pro Scouts in the house a sophomore from mayorca in Spain his numbers wont jump off the stat sheet at you but for the you look at the athleticism the body of that young man and theres a lot in the future for Baba Miller nice left side pass to the corner Miller and using all of his 61 you can see why people are so excited with him because hes got a basketball body Florida State on an 8 nothing run for Leonard Hamilton in his 22nd season at Florida State ACC coach of the year last year an anomaly LA or or Im sorry several times over for the ACC coach of the year in anomaly last year when they only won nine games but they were hit hard with the injury book injuries eligibility issues attrition everything that could go wrong did go wrong they did not win their fourth game last year until December 21st there is deep range Darren Green Jr second year in Tallahassee started his collegiate career at UCF and he is a terrific threepoint shooter one of the elite shooters from Bonus land in the country averaging two and a half per game so far in this season for the nolles who have won four of their first five inside chiwa cant get anything going heres Florida State they had numbers momentarily Miller picked up by chiwa and now Jackson checking into the game his turn to fire away Florida State asking for a foul hoping for a foul a travel instead is called Mike White in his second year in charge of Georgia he was in Florida where he went one in five against Florida State Conference of the year in three different conferences at conferences including his last stop at Florida but he came in Tom cream had Zer winning seasons in four years they only won six games in creams last year and they got 10 more last season in Whites first year Pam I got to tell you that last foul went the other way I thought that was going to be a foul on Georgia Instead The Whistle was on FSU now one that struggles with playing FSU they switch everything one through five and its pretty interesting to watch Georgia is not going to run a lot of offense I dont think theyre going to emphasize spacing and driving offense has really been a problem for Georgia their scoring drought now is over I discovered a lump in my neck that led to a biopsy which led to the words that no one wants to hear you have cancer and in my case tonsil cancer so that led to radiation and chemo and neck dissection there were many many dark days I was not able to go to my fathers funeral but the speech that Jim Bano kept playing in my head as if he was trying to use his Spirit to reach out and hug me so wont you please donate remember every dollar given goes directly to cancer research I am a proud member of the V foundation and uh great story and youre right every single penny that people are able to donate goes to help and it has helped so many people so many families it affects all of us one way or the other right now the University of Georgia trying to get something to go down thats nice word board work by mon creef but I think the officials have got to figure out what the shot clock should be on there were so many offensive rebounds in a short period of time Le Cel Bill Covington AJ Desai our officials this evening in Tallahassee so one of the struggles Georgia has had this year shooting the basketball overall field goal percentage last in the league threepoint percentage 12th in the league free throw percentage ninth in the league thats been one of the struggles and when we asked Mike White about that today he W he admitted he was surprised right at how much they have struggled a clock issue so the officials are over at the official scoring scorers table to try to get that taken care of Georgia for the entire season hitting just 39 from the floor just 30 from three and we have seen them now in a scoring drought thats well over 4 minutes Mike White trying to draw something up this is the first the inaugural ACC SEC challenge both on the mens and the womens side ACC with three T teams that are ranked SEC has five of them this is on the mens side but Pam look at those numbers of players on opening day rosters in the NBA between these two leagues they have more than anybody else and both these leagues Pride themselves on getting the ball up and down the floor with six teams averaging more than 80 in the ACC Miami leading the way now that figure will drop after last night and then five on the SEC side with Alabama leading the way how about the Clemson win on the road last night at Alabama PJ Hall the leading score in the ACC he had 21 and that that high low action with Hall Paul and shefflin for Clemson paid dividends all night long right now the ACC leads five games to four in this challenge that will conclude tonight Pam if your game starts this late should you have a first half review isnt that like illegal yeah it certainly will draw things out a little bit heres green the best threepoint shooter for Florida State B to the floor but nothing called by the officials he doesnt quite have logo range but its pretty close yeah almost Caitlyn Clark like Mendez tried to get it in to chiwa RJ Melendez started the first six games of the year but has come off the bench the last couple we you talk about shooting wo scsh Melendez who was at the University of Illinois he is two for 21 for three really struggling I just didnt like that onehanded pass off the bounds trying to hit a streaking teammate be a little more fundamental fla State a very deep team Fletcher now in the ball game along with nickelberry its good to see Corin in the game absolutely Corin not getting a start today cuz he fractured his toe against Colorado but he has an orthotic in his shoe still diving after loose balls but that is a shot clock violation because the shot attempt did not hit the bucket Cameron Corin thats interesting because I thought the attempt hit the underneath side of the rim going to be judicious with Cams minutes tonight sophomore forward from Allan Texas and his dad Richard played basketball at the University of Georgia for one distinguished guy yeah we have several of those kinds of stories tonight yeah a lot of connections with Hugh Durham who was a head coach for both of these schools he is in the building tonight theyre honoring him blue Kane trying to chase it down for Georgia Kane one of the true freshmen on this team and also a sight for sore eyes for Florida State Jaylen gainy number 33 has checked into the game for the first time this year in fact the first time since he played at Brown got hurt in the preseason last year when he tore his ACL so he is back and healthy a grad student from Brown where he got his degree in Business economics youre old nature yeah theres so few of us but he gives them another another body that can operate block the block thats good good work by Melendez getting through the screen shot clock again into single digits see I dont think either team wants to play this way nickelberry got pun with one second left on the shot clock so many times we talk about offensive patience theres also such a thing as defensive patience dont be impatient the reach in there was only one on the shot clock theres no reason blue Kane picks up his first personal foul Kan The Freshman out of Knoxville two3 of his shots this year have been from distance a lot of newcomers on this team for Mike White newbies combination of freshman and transfers thats my term newbies so many transfers now with the portal oh my this kid can shoot Darren Green its almost not fair if youre a threepoint expert can also score off the bouns here again straight line drive and finally a chance to get some points thats Justin Hill in Off the Bench take another look crossover goes straight up and down beautiful balance on his shot all great Shooters pass the two Q tests I know you work a lot with Debbie antelli shes big into that the 2q test is is your release quick and quiet and his is yeah and they seem to just be perfectly timed Tomorrow full evening of ACC SEC challenge matchups for womens college basketball first its Missouri and Virginia at 5 Eastern then Alabama Syracuse follows ad on the ACC Network and ESPN app and cap your night with Texas AM and Wake Forest all coming up tomorrow joany Taylor Texas AM womens Coach who is the former head coach at the University of Georgia succeeding the let the man the myth the legend Andy Landers who we hope is enjoying his retirement Georgia trying to get something going Mendez but he ran right into Watkins thats just taking it too far off off the bounce to slow down those are the kind of unforced mistakes that drive coaches crazy Georgia has not hit a field goal in almost s minutes but still only Trail by six Florida State not exactly lighting things up themselves three Music Applause threepointers and theres Baba Miller hes got one of the threes Melendez and Kane little friendly action trying to get the rebound now lets watch what Im talking about theres a switch early so theres a Mitch Match on top so notice no offense its just space and drive and you got to make that thats a good feed pretty good look for Kane but he was unable to hit it here he goes green cant get it Baba Millers follow wouldnt fall and now a held ball is called JCC huddle preview show right here on the ACC Network in the ESPN app talking to people around town theyre all planning on going to Charlotte some of them are going to go tomorrow make that work on Saturday when they take on Louisville I think youre going to have a fastpaced game tomorrow night yeah we got we got Florida State and Arkansas women coming your way on ESPN 2 here tomorrow night they both average about 100 possessions a game yeah thats pretty good right that is I Im Im kidding Florida state is in the 80s though and really take another look at the loose ball its just dribbling into trouble then monre tries to save it weve talked about georgs struggles but Florida State not lighting it up either these two teams have combined to hit just one of their last 18 shots from the floor and Georgia already with five turnovers the good news is they have not been of the live ball pick six variety five turnovers and two two made field goals jabri Ador Raheem sharies kid with the ball and another whistle underneath after another Georgia Bulldog Miss yeah I think this time green was out of bounds trying to save it Abdul rahee has been Georgias most consistent threepoint shooter hes made three or more threes already three times this year and has been double figures five of six games and the only game he wasnt in double figures was when he had nine against Providence we saw Florida State work on that Zone on the out unders that shoot around today Geor just having trouble as Delo is forced to take a time out victory over Florida and kayin and his dad Rob in the house love it and the Florida State but tonight they said theyre all Georgia theyre cheering for for Jaylen yeah I was going to ask where did they get their tickets which which school provided the by Mike Mobley their incredible sports information director theyre in the Georgia Section Chuck Walsh also the sports information director of Florida State we got two of the best with us here tonight yeah Georgia got a wide open look for blue Kane whos kind of a threepoint specialist more than 50 of his shots are from Bonus land but so far his freshman year just 28 Georges now missed its last 10 shots one of the problems Florida state had against Florida was a lack of ball rotation theyve gotten much better especially in that win against Colorado Florida State their only loss and they got thumped in Applause Gainesville Justin Hill bringing it up a whistle on the shot there is a great change of pace by Justin Hill as he attacks watch as he brings the ball up the floor hes evaluating the defense but watch him kick it into another gear right there and thats what created and Drew the foul and Hill goes back to the free throw line hill the senior from Houston his second year at Georgia played a couple of years at Longwood where he was twotime all conference player Pam do you think the rim to our right where George is shooting is like a carnival Rim Yeah it seems to have something wonky about it even the free throws arent going in tell you better be pure if its going in no Florida state has missed 12 of its last 13 shots 137 Midway through the first half its a football score Baba Miller directing traffic heres Watkins yeah hes too good there he took advantage of the mismatch he had Hill on him hill only 6 feet Watkins 67 the transfer from VCU watch again in and out it is yeah I cant tell you how many times Ive done that at the county fair yeah no stuff for you Im dating myself the county fair so going to the free not line is jir Watkins as you mentioned couple years at VCU hes a great fed though because I mean this this system that Leonard Hamilton has almost perfected over the years their strength is their length and theyre built to defend and Watkins is certainly filling that category and take a look at what he did in the last two games including that double double in the ranked WI win over Colorado hence the coplayer of the week in the Atlanta Coast Conference four straight double digit scoring games for jir who gets a couple in at the line and now some of that pressure off the made free throws I dont know that they cause a lot of backourt turnovers I think its a cumulative effect theyre just not going to give you 47 ft three take some time off the shot clock as well Noah Thomasson hes a bucket getter nothing but air on that attempt and Georgia just cant buy one right now yeah I just dont think you can attack that length East West youve got to go north south and Thomasson was fading away Thomasson coming off a season High 24 points and went over winr like the rest of his teammates struggling today theyre just two of 13 from the floor 15 thats contact and a foul drawn again Again by Watkins who gets to the line the most of any seol player this season itll be interesting if they call this a shooting foul or not because theres no question he passed the ball but I again I go back to this its one of the cornerstones of being good offensively is ball reversal to move the defense and that last possession the ball went from the right to the left take a look at how Georgia started and how its gone since not not going so well hell checks out Melendez comes in so some more length on the floor for Mike White who told us he he still really likes this team he said they are so consistently trying hard playing hard in practice perhaps the best in that area of any team hes ever coach so theyve not gotten down on themselves even though theyre still trying to figure some things out but the bottom line Pam you got to make shots chiwa comes up with the rebound now for Georgia finally one goes down its abdor Raheem and that breaks a drought I just love the pass ahead one of the ways that you can be a switching manto man is get the ball down the floor quickly Melendez coming up with the rebound coming off the bench the last couple of games and good defense War got a hand in there to disrupt things and now Miller its a zippy pass over to Watkins and now a whistle behind the play and theyre going to get Baba Miller for Florida State for the personal Applause foul just kind of threw his man to the ground take another look bottom part of your screen jostling for position yeah thats an easy call got him hooked up now Leonard Hamilton trying to get a an explanation and quickly Miller goes over to the bench again just a sophomore didnt play last year actually earlier this year technically January 11th of 2023 his first game suspended for the first 16 games as there was the NCAA again with trying to pay back some money and yep inconsistencies of their rulings Pam doesnt it feel like Florida State should be up more yes theyre only up by five and this is a Georgia team that has only hit three field goals all game Florida state has gone cold on their end as well theyre a club that Leonard Hamilton says is still trying to find their identity that time abdor Raheem missed what was his line in flux yes thats the most important thing and theyre not getting any offensive rebound either that missed by Music Fletcher drive another whistle I well take a timeout I mentioned this earlier if you want to beat the switching manto man make sure the ball beats the defense the quick outlet but watch this quick pass ahead and Abdul rahee with the corner three beats the defense Georgia trying to be the hangaround team Applause Sunday night the Huddle crew will have their annual selection Day special a 1hour show that includes breakdowns and Analysis of the accs B bound teams and their matchups covered starts at 6 Eastern right here in the ACC Network in the ESPN app Georgia and Florida State fans cant wait for for that this this young man Ken Del pamman Florida State wins in football this weekend they have to be in dont they as an undefeated yes thats right the top four teams are all 12 and0 Ohio State losing to Michigan knocked them out of the top four and put Florida State in so thats why we could get that semifinal between the seol and the Bulldogs free throws right now keeping Georgia close its only a threepoint game first points for Noah Thomasson who was at his fourth school now some pressure off the maid free throws and the drought is broken for Florida State with authority from Fletcher wow thats following up Smashmouth Hoops see the drive its pretty obvious what theyre trying to do its good work just to get a shot off Second Chance well off the mark but yeah Georgia continuing to just pick up their dribble they saw three Florida State Defenders but lets go back to Fletcher yeah following up just off the rim Fletcher knows what to do with it averaging almost eight points a game so far this year but really struggled in that Colorado game coming back last year only 10 games and he tore his ACL but came back in 10 months backto back baskets now for the nolles thats Chandler Jackson getting on the scoreboard for the first time very quick comeback for Fletcher leading score Off the Bench this year for the nolles so I think Thomasson needs to keep shooting the shot had a teammate give him a pretty good dish for the three some good defense underneath that time a lot of contact Mary not called for the personal foul and now Melendez finally an easy look good assist from Thomasson again its all about the drive and dish in terms of attacking not allowing Florida State to switch Music both teams shooting in the 20s percent Applause wise she she he gives him a big body doesnt he yeah 7 feet tall and his third School graduated and now playing his final year at Music Georgia Melendez with a nice change of pace is able to get it high degree of difficulty through traffic good finish by Melendez yeah guy we had mentioned earlier struggling with the shot coming off the bench for a second straight game its just one of 10 in his last game against winth including eight threes that he Music missed and the drive by warley doesnt get the friendly bounce and another board for chiwa numbers numbers drive with the left hand didnt fall for Dem but he got fouled again its all about driving the basketball theyre having success watch as they bring it up the floor Thomasson gets feed in the paint but a great Kansas cut by Melendez in the finish and speaking of Melendez how about this High degree of difficulty slicing between Defenders off the window and Georgia for the first time feels like theyve got a little bit of of offensive flow freshman demy at the free throw line first true freshman to start a season opener for Georgia since 2019 and now Rich Hamilton trying to get some fresh bodies on the floor including Baba Miller thats with his style and pace of play you will see guys just go for certain no stretches yeah no question about it Leonard Hamilton was talking to us today about Trent for one of the greats here and he admitted that he could only play about 24 minutes a game I I promise you theres not many players that would admit I coach I can only go 24 and not many who would be okay with it certainly its almost like hockey line changes you got to get them in there quickly because they have to go full bore the entire time nice but nickelberry M left rebound taken down by demory whos had a nice stretch here for the last couple of minutes and thats going to be another foul on Miller about with four rebounds three points what did Leonard Hamilton tell us his number one concern was about this game transition threes and weve seen that today thats two on Baba Miller theres just no reason to make that foul youve got to know the value that you bring to your team and and when you make a foul like that youre going to the bench as you take a look at some blanks being fired they sitting down now with those two personals lot of potential for him Kane rescued at midcourt by demy and then an offensive foul yeah just extended that arm a little bit too much cannot dislodge the defender thats what demory did thats a no Music no second foul on demy Mike White in his second year at Georgia Taylor B Bowen is in the game number 10 in white for Florida State a freshman from Vermont there he is Jump stop oh my goodness GE the travel but thats a bucket hes almost like a triple jumper the way he got into the paint b bow and just averaging two points a game but how about the skill set for a guy 61 yeah very impressive deep bench for Coach Hamilton we approach three minutes to go here in the first half left wide open good ball fake open just for a minute was Hill and then he tried the drive and was called for the charge Justin Hill picks up the foul little offensive burst in the last couple of minutes Florida State up by four as we take a Music timeout back in Tallahassee the new Block charge rule says as a secondary Defender you have to be there in legal guarding position by the time the offensive player plants his last foot so take another look at the drive that time by Justin Hill the defender still has his foot up off the ground again thats in slow motion watch in real speed how quick of a bang bang play this is and thats why my father was an official and I swore I would never be an official that is very very diff I went to the dark side of coaching the offensive foul was called hamard and Mark Wise joining you tonight and theres one right off the rim for Deontay Applause green last time these two teams met was December 1st 1981 its almost 42 years ago yeah the first time they met was 1951 so let me beat you to the punch no I did not do that game oh no no that was so long ago the last time they played Dominique Wilkins was the leading scorer he had 20 points in that game I think Ive heard of him yeah he I think things worked out well for him its interesting Taylor B bowan has really given I think FSU a kind of an energy shot if you will Off the Bench theres the alltime series last meeting again just two days short of 42 years Dominique wikins LED Georgia to the victory part of this challenge Im sorry Pam Georgia May do a screen on the ball just to get a switch like right here but then its all about driving Pi they not yeah its just space and drive and now the shot clock is dwindling quickly down to 5 Seconds Kane has to do something must have just kept a toe down Thomasson tried to rescue it but theres old Bowen getting the rebound bringing it up one of the true freshman on this Florida State team tell you what Pam you play with energy rebound the ball youll get more minutes yep leard Hamilton likes those kind of guys rims out for Jackson a call on the rebound yeah I think this is is on Georgia fighting for inside position trying to keep Deontay green off the glass Matthew Alexander monrie called for his first foul 68 senior Toronto green goes to the line Cru have it all covered up the road in Charlotte the ACC Championship football game between Louisville and Florida State covered starts Friday at 3 Eastern with the ACC huddle preview show right here on the ACC Network and the ESPN app ball game 800 eastern time from Charlotte Pam I think the last two minutes are really important for Georgia theyve kind of been the hangaround team they havent turned the ball over a lot as a consequence neither team has shot the ball very well but thats allowed Georgia to be that hangaround team Deonte delivers from the line George has gone now almost three minutes without a score but still hanging around as you said down just Music six good defense collapsing cut off the drive and then off class it just spins in how about the the Hang Time by Hill off a big 15point game win against Music Winterberry out on the perimeter and That Was telegraphed Here Comes Melendez who runs the court well and slams it Applause down J M Mendez Off the Bench now for the last couple of games for the dogs theyre only down two nice job by Melendez reading that rule a thumb fake a pass to make a pass how about green again High degree of difficulty with the Applause twos Darren Green gets the lead back to four Thomason cut off by Jackson has to reset so theres the big little switch theres the drop and theres the Applause foul well if youre going to throw a guard to guard pass its got to have some zip on it Melinda see his eyes he read that the whole time thats an easy finish and for a team struggling to score anytime they can get easy points that becomes bonus points and this Georgia team has hit four of its last five field goals which is remarkable because they only have seven overall that have gone in the basket so that means they were three of 19 otherwise I Music believe no Thomasson the Lefty has it Rim out Applause rebound Florida State calls a timeout we will take a 30 second break Leonard Hamilton trying to draw something up to get some more points before half welcome back to Tallahassee waning seconds of the first half Florida State leading Georgia by four seminal calling the timeout what was the magic number I gave you earlier in the game you said uh 21 points 14 14 was the magic number Georgia had to keep FSU to 14 points or less take another look and FSU George has only turned it over seven times but more importantly FSU only has five points off turnover so more than acceptable for Mike Whites team that is something that Florida State feeds on how about this a little change of Defense little one two two Applause Zone Nick white switching things up the timeout its about 6 seconds difference between the two clocks and then they switch to man so its a combo defense pora States got to go nickelberry a desperation shot good defense there by Georgia as you mentioned with the switching it up Mendez from distance cant get it to go but Georgia both teams need to make shots you know we asked and talk to coaches and what do you have to do to defend to win win they say the same thing we got to defend and rebound defend and rebound no you dont you got to make shots if you make shots the rebounding isnt that big of a deal right and these two teams continuing to struggle Georgia made Seven field goals in the first half just nine for Florida State two assists total for the seals Georgia made its first two field goals and four of its last five in between they missed 15 of 16 whats interesting to me is the FSU defense that switches one through five they make you play unscripted you dont run offense and Georgias done a really good job of just keeping it simple spacing and driving Georgia team well that was a a blatant hole Yeah on the J green that would have been a hold in football for sure but the officials didnt see it and the basket went in De just does two for 12 from Deep on the year drains that in Georgia like they did in the first 20 off to a quick start only down by a Point Drive contact by chiwa but no foul called verticality there by the big guy Georgia yeah they had some success beating the defense down the floor the same spot for the lead but it goes on off the rim rebound taken down by warley who did not score in the first Applause half yeah I I understand the FSU system I just think Baba Miller needs some more shots and again its the quick transition even after a make Georgia is pushing the ball quickly B Miller hit a three early in the first half and has one here early in the second talented Music sophomore foul on Deonte green heres demy at the free throw Applause line thats a pair of threepoint plays by demy one from Beyond The Ark and the and one just the onepoint Advantage for Florida State another Miss rebound battled for and a tie up and now chiwa wont let go of the basketball and the officials literally get down onto the floor its chian Deontay green tied up green is still on the floor Applause well weve been talking about football all night it kind of looked like the officials were trying to figure out who had the fumble take another look two guys going after the rebound I think kind of get tangled up I thought that looked worse than it was Im sure the officials led by Lee Cassell will take another look at this what we dont know is what was happening in the scrum heres another look better angle I got to believe if anybodys guilty here its chiwa and taking a look from that angle I see a little bit more than I did the first time R Chi of 7 ft 245 pounder his first year playing for Georgia and indeed the officials are going over to the monitor to try to straighten things out well if theyre talking about flagrant one youre youre usually talking about something thats excessive or unnecessary if its a flagrant to its you add in severe uncal for brutal harsh extreme heres a look from up above the thing that interests me is that chiwa actually had on he had his hands on the ball the whole time neither player gave up on the play this will be an interesting Applause Music decision I think if anybodys guilty of something excessive its chiwa green was able to grab the rebound on the box out chiwa was about 3 in taller than Deonte and then came over and dragged them both to the floor Pam I got to tell you I love the way the officials handled this in terms of getting right in literally on top the action to diffuse anything that might go on outside of that got in there very quickly and no foul was called on the floor by the way so just waiting to get word from the official review well I think anytime all three guys are looking at it they have the same kind of thought process that we have had Music here you can sell Bill Covington AJ decide huddling up well take another look see I think if if anything this could be a flagrant one on chiwa that angle from the basket you could see that right arm that seemed to be around Greens neck as Deonte and shihwa hit the floor we getting an explanation Music now all right Mark what do we got well they decided a flagrant two on chiwa so thats two shots and the ball chiwa is disqualified but one player from fsus bench also left that area so he is disqualified there are no free throws for that Technical and then we will play on so chiwa will be badly missed by George not from a scoring perspective but he has rebounded the ball very well tonight thats a tough call again and I understand the take down look really bad so chiwa exits as you mentioned hes their leading rebounder on the season is not scored tonight but a big body inside as he Music Music exits Music yeah one of the players on the bench for Florida State Max Thorp came out on the floor yeah hes in the sweat see hes on the floor thats a no no so now heres Darren Green shooting the free throws because of the flagrant two on chiwa why do great free throw shooters Miss technical foul shots cuz no ones on the uh thats exactly right its different free throw shooting is about repetition and confidence and when theres nobody on the lane youre changing the repetition part of a free throw I see it all the time yeah Green is an excellent free throw shooter 80 goes one and two on that trip and now this is going to be important that delos for Georgia picks up the rebounding that theyre going to miss Del just one rebound started the game has not even taken a shot that went right through Watkins on the inbounds Georgia looking to tie or take the lead they LED very early in this game before going cold Baba Miller stuck his hands in if thats a foul on him thats his third and it is take another look at this out underpan because the player who broke open was wide open the ball gets deflected though and that creates the turnover but on the cut Watkins was clearly open that would have been an easy two without the deflection I go back to fake a pass to make a pass the just a 50 or pardon me had been six of 10 from the line this season before he missed that one Alo Miller with three personal fouls you missed two free throws thats like a turnover M of staying out there playing with the three fouls there he Applause is Worley still looking for his first points tonight much better offense by Florida State Miller with a little scoop pass good patience underneath by Applause Green like a well executed play it resulted in the basket there was everything he want in that possession by Florida State by far their best half court possession in this game mon take green now with four made his first career start tonight thats thrown away trying to get it to Melendez out on the wing here is the half court possession I was talking about by the nolles it starts with ball movement ball reversal feet in the paint cut to the basket find a teammate score at The Rim excellent Music job four assists for Florida State in this game four assists on 11 made field goals and Watkins finds the bottom of the Applause net so lets see if Georgia goes back to the same spacing and driving not allowing the switching defense to take effect Mendez down at the Baseline calling for the ball and thats a reach in on warley yeah but if you get faked like that youre allowed to reach in a little Music bit take another look Little James Harden like isnt it back and forth between the legs also got his feet tied up a little bit with the Loach as well second foul on Applause warley roach good kick out Thomas see Watkins getting way up into the air to come down with the rebound going Coast to Coast just off the rim green underneath and a foul before the shot this is where they missed chiwa in terms of his ability to rebound the ball especially on the defensive Music end since the ejection Florida state has gone on a 0 run Shea called for a flagrant two and ejected from the game starting center for this Georgia team Delo goes to the bench Kane is coming back in its almost like a line shift yeah for Georgia Raheem wants to be a broadcaster when hes playing days are over he heads to the Music bench 20 seconds to Music Applause shoot there on Watkins now shot clock in the single digits Chandler Jackson able to get the shot up and was the shot up and was fouled Florida State on a bit of a run now as we take a timeout in Music Music Tallahasse AC ACC it just means more lets

team right now especially with shiwa out of the game not a true post presence right in the old traditional sense correct good point by you so its a bunch of power forwards playing against each other I think I think its kind of a danger zone the first danger zone that really Georgia has faced his eightpoint lead matches the biggest of the game for Florida State and just when they needed it no its Thomasson able to knock down the three ball thats just great recognition by Justin Hill laid in The Possession to set up the Thomas and three see if Florida State can build off their offense that I talked about in the last segment thats Applause isolation Kane unable to come up with it but the rebound Melendez who had six rebounds in the first half which tied his career high for rebounds in a game Hill with the Miss Melendez kept it alive Melendez rims it out great activity though the best threes often times come about after offensive rebounds thats a charge there wasnt any doubt about that thats even a primary defender in transition and Watkins just kind of ran over him take another look coming right at you Thomasson holds his Music ground see both feet hes facing the offensive player hes the primary Defender legal guarding position Music theres a fine line there when in transition whether youre the primary or secondary Defender thats the second time Melendez has been open on that Kansas cut I call it a Kansas cut because they did it better than anybody else Ive seen watch out watch out it had been an eightpoint lead and now its down to just two Kane gets his his first points and four personal fouls by the way now on jir Watkins who just was called for the charge on the last trip down for the Applause seals green smooth that is a tough two though isnt it he has made some tough twos tonight yeah youre right the guy who was known for his threepoint shooting higher percentage tonight five of 11 overall Georgias gotten on a roll here lately the last couple of possessions why the three ball I love this kick out get feet in the paint find your shooter Thomasson knocks down to three and then after an offensive rebound ball reversal make the extra pass blue Kane see the seams on the ball rotating beautifully that gets everybody on the Georgia bench up Blue by the way not his given name given name is Christian but blue is his nickname his father was a golfer at Duke Duke as in Blue Devils in Blue Devils so hence blue Kane his mom was a terrific basketball player at George Washington Mariah lonan so good blood lines for blue you got to get the ball away from the sideline oh Drive offensive rebound nice job anel amay working the offensive glass kind of has had a lesser role so far this year but in the absence of chiwa he may get more minutes and as I talked about earlier in the first half you want more minutes do the little things impact winning in other ways other than scoring and he is 6 10 in tall Cruz have the ACC football championship all over it in Charlotte its before the Louisville Florida State football game starting Friday at 3 Eastern ACC huddle prevue show on the E ACC Network in the ESPN app and you see all the other programming 800 eastern time kickoff in Charlotte on Saturday Florida state with the win should stay in the top four get into the playoffs match up with Georgia does Lille have a shot I dont think so okay I like putting you on the spot I see you kind of cringe there when I asked you yeah Im not Im usually not very good at this kind of stuff or else Id be living in a bigger house but um well said very well said its going to be and for Georgia they are in the SEC Championship football game against Alabama neither of those teams met were going to see in those championship football games they did not meet in the regular season this year green a little bit short Delo comes up with the rebound here come the dogs only down three this seems to me like sometimes FSU passes up shots to take a tougher shot and again theres the quick response in transition and the good fake as well Leonard Hamilton looking on had a chance to speak with him this afternoon he talked about how theyre still trying to find their identity said he had some coarse conversations over the last few days that was his players that was an interesting phrase he used wasnt it talking about trying to find the identity and be consistent talked about how they they they beat Colorado and and by the way this is insane Florida state has one 14 straight overtime games which is by far an NCAA record I Ive never even I couldnt I cant even fathom that if you were 500 in overtime games it would be really good demory misses both free throws yeah theyve had some trouble at the line but you have 14 straight overtime wins including that victory over Colorado Colorado in the top 20 eight straight overtime win against top 25 teams right there thats crazy but its driving Leonard Hamilton crazy that they played so well against Colorado and then you know against Florida they did not lets say he wants to see some consistency they try the alleyoop it doesnt work gainy did not look comfortable there jayen gainy coming back from a knee injury first game of the season and count it as Georgia attacks the basket with Justin Hill the creativity watch this finish on the right side with his left hand underneath the two shot blockers take another look how crafty was that finish for the and one opportunity just Hills six points Off the Bench gets the threepoint play coming off a season High 15 points in Georges last game against winra and we are all tied up Florida State led by eight here in the second half theyve been outscored by four in this half we talk about FSU rolling through players with their dep Mike White has done a really good job of getting um Thomasson as well as hell blows during the course of the game trying to keep them fresh keeping up with this fast pace green hits it he he has the green light any point in time good antidote to stop a Music streak second three of the evening and now the rebound Id look yeah Id look for green in transition here Miller Baseline got it now this time fsus offense in transition beat the Georgia defense down the floor six nothing run after Georgia tied it at 37 Theo in a precarious position when he got the pass the ball stays with Georgia but three ball again the friend for the seol well the seol who have struggled here in the second half scoring but first Darren Green with his like 1000th career made three over his career and then Baba Miller knocks down his third three ball tonight home team up Music six welcome back the inaugural ACC SEC mens challenge underway here Florida State up by six and some news and notes Kentucky with that convincing win against Miami who got to the final four last year and North Carolina holding off Tennessee to win that game by Music eight and some upsets as well Georgia Tech upsetting Mississippi State same for Clemson over Alabama and Virginia taking out AM yeah the big surprise to me I think was Clemson winning at Alabama and in the second half I think Clemson was 16 points per possession thats really off the charts good right now Arkansas is beating Duke by 10 still plenty of time left to go in that mens game Pam that first graphic we had you just dont go into rup and win and you dont go into the dean doome and win yeah again Justin Hill I talk about Mike White giving him a breather here and there along with Thomas and and its paid dividends yeah Justin Hill is giving him some really good minutes off the bench too strong off the board demy with the emphatic rebound to Loach though couldnt handle the outlet cleanly hes looking for some help green with the defense Miller got a hold of it from behind and Baba goes down as he was clipped by Abdul Raheem yes if this were football we would call that an illegal block I like the activity right now it seems like Georgia is the quicker team to the ball thats a pretty good look and the ball comes out Millers quickly Music there Miller seems to be all right and I keep looking at these points off turnovers FSU only has eight so Georgia doing what I thought they needed to do to beat the hangar around team for the state leading AC and turnovers aaging about 21 points a game off of them but keeping it down tonight and theres another foul yeah I just dont like that foul that aggressive 40 ft from the basket and you put FSU at the free throw line because that was team foul number seven so both teams in the bonus Fletcher hasnt been there many times this year just two for five Music Applause it is freshman year for Music Kentucky transferring over to Florida State perfect FSU as they have the entire game when they score they pick up 94 ft theyll deny the inbounds and then its basically to pressure but theyre going to make you work to get It Music Ups had the ball in his hands a lot theres Melendez goes in on the Baseline to jam it home jam Mendez doing work on the boards and getting some points as well coming off the bench now for Georgia he needs that cuz he had been struggling here here lately green with the basket count it now Deontay will be heading to the free throw line nice little pocket pass to finish this play inside to Deonte watch the pass right there thats a great catch by Deontay green and thats that new rule that we talked about Defender was not there but by the time that Deontay green left the floor with that last foot foul was on demory so Darren Green with the assist to Deontay green and no they are not Applause related Darren grew up in Charlotte Deontay from Asheville both North Carolinians but no relation well you cant leave him open wow Thomason thats a rare bad Miss for Noah he was wide Music open so you probe now ball reversal now get into your offense and theres a mismatch underneath and now Hill finally switches over because Deontay green was on him with a significant height advantage and theres a hole Del got too much and Pam these fouls are going to add up quickly on Georgia remember theyre playing the second half without chiwa who was ejected from the game there was a pass that Baba Miller made from the corner to the post player that only a guy his size can make cuz he just kind of looked at the defender and threw over him at 611 and just a sophomore again there are some uh NBA Scouts in the building and this young man has already drawn a lot of interest some good experience with the under 19 Spanish team in the World Cup championships this last summer in Hungary and and got the news that hes going to train with the senior national team and thats going to be a great experience for him I think When Baba Miller realizes he could be great be a good day I think he just is just figuring out how good he can be we asked Leonard Hamilton about it he said said he just has all the skills whatever you want he has it and he also has a high basketball IQ so coach Hamilton also believes the sky is a limit for him ninepoint Advantage for Florida State Georgias kind of answered the call all night when when being Music down this is the biggest lead of the game Melendez cant get the three to fall rebound taken down by Fletcher not complicated but very successful in getting a quality look heres Miller of whom we just spoke working on Mendez got it stripped and it came right into the hands of Fletcher Millers going to want an assist on that it was the last sem all to touch it before Fletcher put it in the hoop the Florida state now up 11 their biggest lead of the game take another look last score Bubba Miller hell W an assist for this but check out the quick hands and it goes right into the hands of Fletcher who scores and FSU up double figures for the first Music time welcome back to Tallahassee where we remind you Sunday night the Huddle crew has its annual selection Day special 1hour show includes breakdowns and Analysis of the accs Bold bound teams and their matchups cover starts at 6 Eastern right here on the ACC Network and the ESPN app count it for corn thats a great look ahead that time by Darren Green we have complimented George ability to transition offense this time its FSU bring the ball up the floor evaluating the defense he found his teammate open corn ahead of everybody delivered on point foul on Anselm eBay Corin coming off the bench today limited minutes after he fractured a toe in the first half of the win against Colorado playing with an orthotic in his shoe much needed three by abdor Raheem yeah he lives in that corner you cannot help same SI oh quick and quiet technically beautiful shot too that goes down for Darren Green to get the lead up to 14 Georgia had just made a three and theres the answer and theres the find him find him yep watch out watch Applause out backto back threes for Darren Green hes got 21 tonight that is a new season high for Applause him more importantly its now a 17point Advantage Kane cant hit from three Music Applause rebound taken down by Corin one of the elite threepoint Shooters in the country is Darren Green Jr from Charlotte all he needs is just a little bit of space watch the seams on the ball whether in the half court or in transition find your shooter green delivers again Music one of the most prolific threepoint Shooters in the country is Darren Green Jr of Florida State knocking down not one or two or three but four three balls in this game its the fourth time this year already hes made three or more in a game over 1400 career points and one of just a few players to have as many career made threes as green has made so how about the fifth most in terms of active players with 21 tonight he had 91 of them last year up to 3155 in his career you know if I were his teammate what I would tell him if you can see the rim shoot it really thats it if you can see it shoot it Let It Go the Ultimate Green Light for Darren Green Jr who has been terrific here Florida State getting some separation in this game that actually had been tied but its a 163 run of the last 2 and 12 minutes taking a look at to make sure that the clocks are where they should be and we see Watkins back in the game jir Watkins number two for Florida State left about 7 and 12 minutes ago when he picked up his fourth foul and since then Florida state has extended their lead Watkins are leading scorer rebounder and assist man this year coming into this Music game Deontay green turns around and heres Melendez some giving him some good minutes Music Applause tonight near turnover and then the drive results in another foul its been the same Mo for Georgia and Mike White all night long theyve had some success with it because they have certainly taken the switching manman defense by Florida State out of play so theyve spaced and driven the ball demy at the Applause line well he is now two for four but Georgia not helping itself with the free throw line this evening just now nine of 18 50 for them yeah heres another example of Mike White rotating those guards through Hill in Thomas and Music out memory just one of two on that trip but lindz a lot of activity just diving in there and got fouled on the rebound thats just great work theres a lot of want to to offensive rebounding especially in a free throw situation Mendez now with nine rebounds we had six of them in the first half he got a nice contingent of fans opposite us who have displayed the Puerto Rican flag Melendez has played on some Puerto Rican teams gr up down there aoso Puerto Rico nice energy Off the Bench last couple of Applause games and heres Georgia down the floor a little bit with pressure green bottled up in the corner in Applause trouble and then the chancy pass is intercepted by demor thats what you want now convert on the other end to my goodness couldnt have called for it any better you get the turnover and then the three thats the lead back to 11 had been as high as 17 Watkins checked by dor Raheem went by him met Delo and then the Music follow by Deontay green I think thats a new career high now for Deontay green whos put three double figure games together melz had it Rim out Miller gets taken down down this time after he tipped the ball over for a rebound I think the initial ruling here is a double foul based on what I saw AJ decide but of course theyll go take a look at it its Baba Miller and Jaylen Delo who got tied up that Music time earlier in the game we had Russell chiwa the starting center for Georgia ejected from the game after a tie up on a rebound this is weak Music side arms get tangled it looked like Delo was the first one to kind of grab Millers arm but the immediate sign by AJ thei was double Music foul they might just leave it at that and so the officials going over to the monitors Music Miller had tipped the ball out and their arms kind of get tangled up I I dont know who you could say if a hook and hold was involved which one did it take another look Doos see hes got his arm there though I think Dos right hand grabs Millers left arm so dont be surprised if this is a hook and hole of course Im not batting very good tonight Music soou I think theyre going my first thought was double foul let it go so it is indeed a double foul fourth foul for both Delo and for Music Miller Music check that that is the fifth on Miller pardon me so Baba Miller has fouled out of this basketball game goes out with nine points and five Music rebounds it was indeed the fourth on Delo on the other side for Georgia as we approach 5 and a half minutes to go in the game too much time and not enough of a lead to take the air out of the ball yet run your stuff St gives it up and then the foul now this is a double whammy commit a turnover and then foul in transition t on warley I dont think Leonard Hamiltons very happy I think he wants a timeout he takes one I thought the pass down low got deflected and thats what created that whole situation sometimes I Im amazed at how players dont see the defender right in front of Music them coming up tomorrow another full evening of ACC SEC challenge matchups for womens college basketball first Missouri will take on Virginia at 5 eastern time then its Alabama Syracuse and then cap your night off with Texas AM Wake Forest thats all on the ACCC Network and the ESPN app ESPN 2 at 7 Eastern tomorrow well have Florida State taking on Arkansas I might tune in you might I know you got some stuff going on maybe theres Hugh Durham great luck yep Hugh was the legend was honored here at halftime and if youre just joining us Georgias been to one final four coached by Hugh Durham Florida States been to one final four coached by Hugh Durham yes the common thread and Hugh Durham was also a tremendous basketball player here at Florida State first time again that these these two teams have played since December of Applause 1981 thats a long time ago who was the leading scorer in that game again some some neek guy Dominique Wilkins and it wasnt even a senior it was 100 plasman in that game yeah people forget Georgia in 83 was that fourth team in the final four we talked so many times about Jim Alano and that Miracle win against Houston it was Georgia that NC State defeated in the semifinals winding down and with three seconds left warley drew the foul yeah Worleys really struggled tonight especially shooting the basketball but he was so good in that win over Colorado when he had 19 including the very first Basket in overtime which kind of got Florida today going again because they kind of gave up the lead down the stretch big win over ranked team orleys 19 points is season high he had 16 of them after halftime including five in overtime Jaylen 0 for seven from the floor tonight has contributed six rebounds and three Music assists still looking for his first points this is his first trip to the line yeah has a unique shooting style kind of harp pons it at the basket very stiff with his arms watch the release looks like a little hitch in it and yeah youre right and he is only a 64 free throw shooter thats gone down and the bucket for anelim eBay theres that early transition Music again see thats going to be interesting intercepted thats just a bad read and Melendez is really fast down the floor okay dont look Applause now Melendez has gotten himself a double Music double only the second of his career he had one last season against Minnesota when he played with Illinois Deontay green never got set on the screen sometimes though thats the ball Handlers fault for going too soon not allowing your teammate to come out and set a screen for you take another look does the guard take off too early yeah a little bit let your big guy get set you got to give George a lot of credit this is a team that was just down here we go 17 points and theyre not quitting down to five two possession game inside four game on Hill with the bucket hes into double figures as we go inside of four minutes Im so used to watching Florida state with great Rim protectors Leonard Hamilton told us today thats one of the things that theyre trying to figure out up and over for Watkins its an8 nothing Georgia run a ball game in Tallahassee ACC mens basketball is presented by Continental Tire the smart choice in Music Applause TI Georgia was down 17 points and since then theyve caught fire whether its in transition shooting the three ball or getting to the rim before the defense gets set or the ability and the creativity of Justin Hill Georgia has found a rhythm late in this game and what looked like a game that was going to be spread out has not done so and take a look at what FSU has done in the last 2 minutes after taking such good care of the basketball the first 33 minutes and usually Leonard Hamilton is the team thats turning you over and converting on that but Georgia has more points off turnovers in Florida state that shocks me not what we saw coming in or foresaw coming in but thats why they play the game now some pressure off or out of the timeout Yeah a different look a little 221 back to a man demy the true freshman hes been Relentless attacking the rim and hell have another chance at a threepoint play again watch the way that Emory takes away space of the defender goes into all the shot blockers and specifically Jaylen warley for the and one opportunity the defender you need space to operate too youve got to get off keep the guy in front of you if he jumps up and makes a shot then say way to go Dem with the threepoint play he now has has 15 points so a new career high for the young freshman and most importantly we got ourselves a twopoint game absolutely since that 17point Advantage Florida state has only scored two points while George has gone on a huge Applause run 172 to be exact including 11 nothing and Melendez tried to buy a call and he got it yeah Im not sure I agree with this this is the point A to point B emphasis the driver is going into the lane yeah thats a I dont think thats a charge Melendez does a great job of selling it but hes not there Fletcher whistled for the foul and what looked like a flop but now Georgia can tie or go ahead after trailing by 17 here in the second half it was 6144 Applause Music FSU they got what they wanted they got what they wanted Abdul rahem knocking down the three Mike White was trying to orchestrate players in the right spot he wanted Abdul Jabar raheim to be the screener and then get the the pass back Watkins runs into a lot of trouble a good cleanup however by Green just outside the twominute Mark so they cannot take a look at Applause this Georges last lead before abdor raheems three ball was when they were up five to three way back when in the first half see if they run the same set with one black now hes going to the corner boy what a great call that was I think Mike White wants a timeout y to get some things figured out but this is a team that coach white told us before the game he really liked him the the Mantra lets get better today lets keep attacking today and we have seen that a lot of teams down 17 in the second half would have called it today heres the screen by Abdul Raheem and the throwback so many times the the guy thats open is where the ball came from and thats a good job and then on the offensive glass on the other end its Deontay green expanding his new career high the Bulldogs look dead in the water about 5 minutes ago and they were able to in about four minutes and change Take the Lead subsequent ly taken back by Florida State but Georgia who are three and three on the season playing a tough schedule they had a summer trip to Italy that coach white has said really helped as far first off you get extra practic right and the team gets to bond together a lot of new faces but this is impressive on the road you had me at Italy yes and we heard that they they ate well which Im sure is 0 surp surprising but what a what a comeback for the dogs starting to turn Florida State over they have hit their last five Music shots yeah theres the updated scoreboard in your upper right screen ACC with seven wins so they need one more somewhere along the way in these late games Virginia Tech trailing Auburn Duke is losing to Arkansas so they need this one is what youre saying right now it appears this is the team that has the best chance we just have a onepoint ball game in these situations whos willing to take and whos willing to make big shots won Hill caught up good defense by Green shot clock now dwindling to five seconds the drive by demy short and green Deonte comes away with a huge rebound yeah not a quality look certainly coming out of the timeout green readjusted his knee brace while he was coming up the floor after the big Applause rebound warley inside back to him yep there he is wide open green short Mendez with another huge rebound he double digit sorry Pam that was a quality look Hill drives contact no foul fallowing nothing doing but a whistle and a foul on Florida State take another look its not on the first shot that was verticality right there its on the second shot had to have been down low Music janir Watkins has just fouled out of the basketball game seven points tonight just two of 10 from the floor the leading scorer during the season takes his seat and enter Chandler Applause Jackson big free throws here for Anum eBay oh that roll you would never get at the carnival tie game two for ones come into play down the stretch got them both Georgia bounces back on top with just under 57 seconds left to go if not green who takes a shot for Florida Applause State theyre going to discuss just that another timeout taken by the nolles they are down to one Georgia also has one both teams in the bonus FSU points off turnovers tonight as you take a look at our game reset both teams with a single timeout no fouls to give double bonus for both but I said the magic number was 14 and its 11 yep and the number even magical more magical for Georgia theyve scored 17 points off of Florida State turnovers in in part a reason for this comeback again down 17 points so what stages here in the second half so what do we see well what that means is Georgia has not allowed Florida States defense to help its offense they theyve made Florida State into a halfcourt scoring team and thats really not their gig right now theyre still trying to figure out their roles so if Im Florida State obviously everybody in the building knows that l Hamilton would love Darren Green to get a shot I promise you Mike White and his coaching staff are going over that in their huddle I would like to run something where Ive got the ball being driven to the basket with green on the same side so if hes his man stay hes hugged out on him which he should that should open up a driving lane Darren Green Jr has been spectacular four of eight from distance tonight leading every buddy with 21 points and its got to be all hands on deck in terms of the Applause glass Fletcher with the Applause inbound early to Jackson heres the screen from Darren grin now with the ball they try to get him open on a flare good defense by Melendez to keep him out by the logo Jackson with the drive kept it short tip wont go green for the second time to to tall but a foul so many times its not the first shot its the second shot that beats you tough look here by Jackson but deont green who just seems to have a knack for the ball on the offensive glass thats a foul thats obvious shooting so Deontay green five for five from the line tonight which is odd because he came into the game just Applause 50 you cannot simulate these kinds of free throws in practice Music green for the Applause tie doeses just that shot clock off and Georgia has a timeout but they have elected not to take it until they cross midcourt Mike White wants it he gets it with just under 20 seconds left to go I think if I mighte white Im going to do whats been successful all day long in terms or all night long space the floor out wide make sure that Abdul Raheem is one of those corners and then Im going to let Justin Hill operate oneonone and create either for himself or others now timing becomes a big issue here but because you do not want to go too soon the worst case scenario if youre Georgia is you want to go into overtime for Florida State you have got to keep Justin Hill in front of you Georgia has hit five of its last seven field goals as you take a look at the reset trying to come back from 17 points down to get this win in Tallahassee and not just down 17 but with 6 and 12 minutes left and looked like they had nothing going Music NOP 225 run and heres Melendez about to inbounds fans on their feet here see I wouldnt let heel dribble it Id run another player at him he is waiting makes his move with about 8 seconds left to go Melendez is out at the top of the key Hill for the win got it still a second and a half left and the Georgia Bulldogs down 17 with 6 and 1 half minutes left to go with an incredible comeback capped by the game winner by Justin Hill well thats the guy I would have put the ball in his hands he creates for himself they ran a little false action on top but it was Hill who delivered at the end created enough room and separation to have a clean look at the basket take another look he times it beautifully Waits until theres about 8 seconds to go theres a little confusion hes switched out on Fletcher the crossover see the the space he had to get the shot off lots of room and a sensational comeback by the Bulldogs on the road Justin Hill nailing the shot he finishes with 13 points and Mike White said that this is the hardest playing Team hes ever had as far as practicing hard practicing consistently theyre down 17 with six and a half to go when they win the ball game and I believe if my math is correct and Arkansas holds on and theyre in a threepoint game I think late in the game but I think this inaugural AC SEC challenge will finish 7 and seven so what a win for the Georgia Bulldogs a team that two years ago won six games right and then Coach white last year they won 16 so many new faces trying to work in and and stick with and boy did they ever and this is now our player of the game brought to you by Continental Tire its got to be Justin Hill yes of course it does the game winner took it with confidence finish Five for 10 from the floor gets the game winner and what a win for this Georgia Bulldog Squad and they will head home to play play a game on Friday Florida state has to go to North Carolina for their ACC opener but what a win for the dogs so partner I enjoyed it I hope your game tomorrow night is just as exciting it was all Justin Hill coming up next nothing but that theyre going to break down this game we didnt have many offensive fireworks at all for like the first three quarters of this game and then Georgia really turned it on for Mark Wise and the rest of our great crew here in Tallahassee Im Pam Ward as we say so long its
