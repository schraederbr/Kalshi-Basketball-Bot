U 18 total members but the conference tournament remains at 15 and Georgia Tech Will control it is a yellow jacket team that has won four straight at home NC State meanwhile winless away from Raleigh this season and George right away shovels to Ibraham Suare and that one rolls out starting lineup for NC State dant Styles has been their most consistent in League Play Paul mcneel makes his third straight start had a big game last Saturday against wake and Jaden Taylor whos got the ball now at 21 against Georgia Tech last year and that three by Taylor doesnt Applause go for Georgia Tech Duncan Powell career high 26 last time out Nathan George leading the ACC and assist and by Dongo has been a double double machine of late Dongo down low draws the foul on Styles man hes so good down there in the post its its really an element to his game where you know it its turned into his bread and butter you come out to a Georgia Tech practice or shoot around first two guys out always Nathan George and by Dongo and Dongo does a lot of work individually with assistant coach bonsy Wells who knew how to maneuver the post oh absolutely my old guy my uh bonsy play you know playing against him doing you know watching him play is you know hes a you know he was an amazing player and Im sure hes given a lot of wisdom to to Dongo I mean last time I was here he had you know his best game of his career got to have the game winner so Im looking forward to more more play of his Dongo put together four straight double doubles six in the last seven in the month of February he averaged 16 and 13 its really important you know Kevin Keats talked about it early its really important for NC State to get off to a good start here um you know when they start trailing its tough for them to come back so you know look for them to get off to a good start Styles beats Dongo to the rimy hes been their guy of late averaging 19 a game over his last three back at some events hes recent losses they got punched in the mouth early never quite recovered we saw it Wednesday in the game against Syracuse the good old cuse baby we had to put it on him real quick Powell too strong for three George able to track down the rebound he Duncan pal has been a great uh addition to this team you know he he can really shoot the ball I was watching him in warm up in he was hot from the outside Dongo too much Powell Powers at home and thats what he does man hes at the right place at the right time he can knock down the open shot but he also makes a lot of hustle plays they call him the Shag man hes got that low shag he says its a Dallas thing its a Dallas the Dallas Swag you know a little something about it a little bit seen it a few times here and there nice move by Ben Middlebrooks NC State really has been trying to get more production from the Five Spot well thats a good start if thats what theyre looking for Applause Music Dongo no its TI back to Lance Terry teams leading score battle for the board and its knocked out of bounds by Suare I like that shot foul on Suare a push I like that shot out of Dongo right if he can if he can knock that down consistently man hes just adding different elements to his game you just got to keep shooting him and stay confident Marcus Hill NC States leading score checks into the game hes not really an outside shooter but he can get downhill and Kevin Keats wanted more of a perimeter threat so mcneels been starting of late quick sub Applause though Styles defended by Powell Applause Styles the three from Beyond The Arc 12 for his last 25 from Deep hes hot from the outside now one thing NC State wants to do Kevin Keat said we need to push the pace play Fast NC State did not have a single fast break point in the loss to Syracuse the three for by Dango just as seven three on the season in 17 attempts yeah I mean hes got to keep shooting him man especially from the corner if he catches the ball from the corner man has got to go up with no hesitation oconnell they had a great ACC tournament last year scored in double figures and every game had the shot against Virginia to keep the season alive in the semi Terry pulls left it short comes to oconnell set it set it Styles Corner three offensive rebound Middlebrooks George may have gotten away with a foul and Middlebrooks able to draw the foul I like the aggression score yeah I mean we weve seen that this whole year right at in the beginning of the year he was a you know a pass first guy really looking to get others involved and now hes developed that scoring mentality and kind of mixing it up a little bit more its been a process for him but you know during when you got a talent like Nathan George all it takes is for you know a one game for them to figure it out and uh then it takes off from there Ben Middlebrooks at the line your second year at Syracuse you made a similar jump what goes into that I think its experience I think its confidence um you know going through hardship going through ups and downs and and you know really having your teammates trust you to be you know the man on the team and kind of once thats accepted around the team and around with the coach and staff you know it gets easier for a player yeah thats why there was no third year exactly well with this nil you might they might have had me first year thats true he went to the NBA goes rookie of the year right off the bat heres Nathan George and the three rattles out Connell pulls away the board thats another area that George has improved 47 from three over the last five out of bounds to the rambling Applause wreck W pack substitution number seven Bry NC State substitution number one Brandon hyfield How does middle Brooks ever go out of bounds there H that was close NC State putting the pressure on him a little bit I like it and NC State feels hey the wolf pack have a little more depth speed up Georgia Tech make Nathan George work to bring the ball up Georgia Tech with all the injuries theyve had this season really doesnt have any depth they rely on four guys to do most of the scoring heres the Freshman herd the other way and hes fouled by George and thats the other part of it for Georgia Tech your starters especially your big four they cannot get into foul trouble yeah and and Ive seen that this happen with you know with na George he gets in a little bit of foul trouble um you know on a play like that you almost just want to put your hand straight up and just fly by try to force him to make a tough layup dont use up one of your fouls especially you know youre such an important piece to this team Bryce herd The Freshman from Chicago reclassified to join NC State a year early turned 18 only in October hes one of the youngest players in college Applause Music basketball Jaden moof into the game for Georgia Tech George for Dongo its turned over Id like to see uh oconnell no missed opportunity for mcy State up ahead George drops it in Id like to see Georgia Tech make faster plays out the pick and roll theyre holding the ball their guards are dribbling one too many dribbles got to be right off the pick and roll make a choice and the decision Brion Pass Drive kick thir with a triple just a second of the Season you let the bench know all about it Applause Duncan Powell no the follow by Dongo hes been doing that a lot lately crashing the glass and giving Georgia Tech Second Chance opportunities yeah you can see coach kes frustration you know they went over that in the scel report keep him off the offensive glass if hes able to get to the offensive glass all game theyre going to have a second chance points and Powell picks up the foul his first 14 foul wolf pack substitution number five Trey Applause parner substitution number eight J Taylor Applause Brandon Huntley Hatfield down low Dongo another rebound there you go quick decisions off the pick and roll Terry met by herd at the rim and bailed out with a foul first we keep it in Atlanta and we welcome those of you who watched Maryland beat Notre Dame in thec Crosse in a rematch of last years National Championship Georgia Tech looking to get to 500 in ACC play theyre looking to maintain their seating theyre currently the eighth seed as mustaf has it knocked away top nine get a first round byy in the ACC tournament for NC State the situation is dire season on the brink here we are in March NC State in the bottom three in the ACC and if youre in the bottom three when the regular season ends you do not make the ACC tournament Lance Terry goes up and under so the wolf pack if they want another magical Cinderella type run here in the month of March first they have to get into the ACC tournament and if they lose today their chances decrease almost exponentially yeah I I mean theyre in a dog fight tonight its going to be a tough game but wi able game for them you know they they can pull it out they just got to keep playing solid and um you know just to try to keep their hopes alive you know every game is Meaningful for them Den Ro Michael Carter Williams with you here at mamish Pavilion first and only regular season meeting between these two Marcus Hill NC States leading scorer hes now been coming off the bench three games in a row this is a tech team that will play its four main starters all for around 35 Plus minutes George usually doesnt come off the floor hes not on the floor right now as we get a held ball possession arrow NC State State wol substitution number three D Styles so how about the rare rest for Nathan George who in his previous six games had sat for a grand total of four minutes yeah I mean hes making some indecisive decisions you know turning the ball over a little bit um I think coach STM just wanted to get him a second have him regroup and uh come back in and and play like his nor himself Style over mustaf and Dongo with his fifth rebound already yeah hes hes controlling the glass um NC States got to take better shots dangos knocked down 13 already Terry working around the screen Dango wants it guarded by Middlebrooks whos been prone to foul trouble Dongo with a pretty Fade Away Little Dream Shake yeah its an NBA move right there to say the least W pack have missed four of their last five Parker to Middle Brooks blocked at the rim and a Music foul and here we go a nice little turnaround Jimmy right there by Dongo hes doing it all splack on the turn around love it this according the playoffstatuscom and now the worst case scenario if NC State loses and Notre Dame and Cal both win later today NC State would be eliminated from being in the ACC tournament yeah me you know it its its going to be a tough road for them you know to to make the ACC tournament but they just got to keep winning ball games a year ago this team lost four straight heading into the ACC tournament and then authored a Legendary Run winning the ACC tournament five wins five days and then getting all the way to the final four what an amazing run by them the cut off line is 15 bottom three in the league do not get to play in the conference tournament now they won nine consecutive elimination games last March and its the first of March and even though its technically not an elimination game depending on how the results of other games impact uh it certainly feels like it yeah no no this definitely every game is super impactful for NC State um you know probably more than more than anyone else but you know like I said you just got to go out there and play one game in a Time Suare back in there he picked up two early fouls Parker or NC State Trey Parker just picked up his first comes George Dongo one three already that one grazed the rim another offensive rebound Terry using the window tip knock there Middlebrooks now its knocked away Terry again going at middle Brooks for two Terrys disgusted with the amount of Second Chances and third chances Georgia Tech was getting yeah theyre just getting beat to the punch right now and when youre in a team when youre in a position like NC St you know you you really got to get every loose ball um every defensive rebound and really crash the offensive board Georgia Tech already plus seven on the glass Taylor to Middlebrooks packing down Suare and middle Brooks the tough two hes got seven to lead the pack almost a walk by mustaf no good Georgia Tech last time out against pit zero points from the bench now a live ball turnover George accelerates hes got Terry the three no good rebound Applause Middlebrooks Wolfpack want to push Hill cant get the bounce comes back to Parker no no whistle Music George has the matchup wants a Applause Applause screen Terry from inside shot bothered both teams look tired out there neither one getting back on Music Applause defense Marcus Hill gets the basket down low Char to number 3 and a foul thats three already on Suare time out Georgia There It Is up ahead layup NC States pushing the pace they both need to capitalize more and one on timeout by Damon St the bench St doesnt play too many guys anyway so its almost impossible for for them to create a bench mob part of that is because of injuries kaasi Reeves Luke OBrien jav and McCollum all guys that would have been part of the rotation all injured and it has shrunk the bench Damon statamire told me at shoot around Duncan Powell with his energy and the way he plays is a guy that ideally theyd like to bring Off the Bench but theyre basically down to eight scholarship players they dont have that luxury yeah no I mean theyve been messing with the lineup all season long Duncan Powell has been a great asset to this team um you having him in the starting lineup I I personally think its its helpess but thats why Im there it is on Q speaking about the sh damid St has experience too with a depleted roster he mentioned in his second season while at Pacific went into the year with only about eight scholarship guys and then at one point he said theyre playing six guys in a walk on and they they still finished fourth in the league Dongo the block at The Rim there is mustaf out to George ACC assist leader offensive rebound Powell boy Georgia Tech dominating the glass oh good down there too on the Block their late game situation they love to give him the ball in the block and right now you know he finds an opportunity to get a post up touch hes a little under siiz but hes very very good down there six offensive rebounds six second chance points for Georgia Tech is dof into the game for NC State small lineup we get a foul on the perimeter it is on Darion Sutton the red sh freshman thats his second off time out we got a big time block by Dongo here gets it off the glass on the other end pow a little jump hook over the left shoulder his bread and Applause Music Applause butter thats why even with the roster with all the injuries they big four can play with anybody you start to ask who could be this years NC State uh theyre near the top of the conversation in the ACC yeah I I think it is Georgia Tech right they have two huge wins um you know they can beat anybody on any given night uh based on how they play um so theyre a dangerous team you know theyre theyre not to be taken lightly at all um they have a legit chance to to win the ACC tournament theyve been tough at home especially of late four straight home wins NC State 0 and 11 this season away from Raleigh its been more than a calendar years since NC State last won a true Road game here comes okon step back three no Dongo 87 rebounds closing in already on his fifth straight double double you can mark it in in the books for him for a double double theyre going to get a foul on Duke 14 foul back why is NC State having so much trouble defending Bango I mean obviously the athleticism that he brings is not easy to match um but theyre also not putting a body on him early right every single time the shot goes up you got to find where hes at put a body on him and let your teammates get the rebound Terrys three rims out tack two of nine from deep and theyve had some good looks theyve had the ball go halfway down and come out you know if they keep getting those looks eventually its going to fall so NC States got to get rid of those Dongo nearly stole it Applause away Id like to see Georgia Tech keep giving the ball on the post to to to Powell to to Dongo and and and let them work out down there a little bit oh Taylor picked up the bounce middle Brooks with 10 hes been the bright spot fory State nine points in the opening half and maybe more importantly no fouls yeah AR on Sutton no good rebound to Music styles styles catch release Splash wolf pack with the lead wolf pack with the lead this is a this is a big uh 6 minutes for for the both pack see if they can build a little lead going into half on the road at Georgia Tech styles with eight B and Middlebrooks have combined for 17 George almost walked Sutton spin move to strong and the rebound to Paul mcneel The Freshman who erupted for 24 last Saturday in the win against wake styles again tipped by oconnell right to Sutton Applause George on the drive and a foul on the floor 15 foul on NC State back foul Charles number two J is first you see Nathan George bring take it strong to the rim accept the contact two free throws substi number three J not two free throws on the floor Terrys been in a bit of a shooting slump especially from the outside of late there you go get it down low on the post size Advantage for Powell backing down oconnell middle Brooks help but too late oh oh its too late even Dongo cut to the corner Im surprised he brought the big fellow over there but pal still made it work brought it to the middle of the floor spun back was able to get two points nine points for Duncan Powell coming off that careerhigh 26 on Applause Tuesday Taylor at 21 against Georgia Tech last here slicing inside turned away by Dongo hes merely making plays on the defensive end offense the defense hey with a slam dong Applause go they reward the big man for running the floor after the block on the defensive end and theyve got this crowd in this Georgia Tech bench riled up mcneel out to middle Brooks down the lane you know early in the year maybe thats a spot where Dongo tries to contest maturity is knowing youre not a deep team dont commit the foul dont commit the foul him in Nathan George you know didnt didnt want to commit the foul obviously you know in a perfect scenario theyd like to keep the ball in front but a situation like that its not worth the foul Powell rattles into three he was feeling it in warmups I was watching him he rallied off about 10 in a row hes staying hot hes got the hot hand hes getting the crowd going in this tuo hes pushing this team dangos got 10 and eight midd Brooks and styles whos got the ball and combined for 19 for the pack now mcneel threeway off and we get a foul on middle Brooks his first first 16 fou officials timeout there we go we got a big oh good bucket right there by big fella hes been you know unbelievable then we got a block on this end by Dongo and on the other end slam with a one hand hes doing it all Georgia Tech NC State Georgia Tech up Applause three and boy the light went off average 16 points almost 13 rebounds and about two blocks per game in the month of February hes been over the last month one of the very best big men in the ACC yeah no and I think you know what Georgia Tech has gone through the amount of injuries theyve gone through the up and down season right theyre 500 theyre 89 in the ACC you know I think he looked at all those things happening and was like Hey somebody needs to step up here and you know Dongo has been that guy now talking to bonsy Wells one of their assistant coaches long time NBA vet at shoot around so we get a lob a foul the basket counts and middle Brooks picks up his second so middle Brooks who struggled to stay out of foul trouble all season has just picked up two in a short period of time Dargo caught that off the Music Applause glass Huntley Hatfield in for Middlebrooks now Dongo right on his season average hes got 12 and8 already you know this is a really good sign for George attack I mean Dongo and pow have been playing great Nathan George hasnt had that you know much of an impact on the game and theyre still up six points George has the five assists but only two points Music Applause running the floor now and time out by Kevin Keat eight unanswered from Georgia Tech the bench with mustaf making the Cameo yellow jackets have hit five of their last six and theyre in control Music and Wake Forest and Music SMU oh we saw NC State briefly take that lead and a Georgia Tech with a strong response a 122 run Great Run by George Tech it started on the defensive end and getting some stops this this is where the wolf pack a lot different than a year ago you needed a bucket last year you went to one of the DJs Burns or horn who steps up now thats big thats Trey Parker The Freshman whos had moments this year 15 against Duke career high 19 against Stanford 13 against Louisville that was a big shot right there stop the bleeding for NC State W pack four of nine from Deep Applause pow no another offensive rebound guess who kept it alive Dongo no surprise there George with six helpers right on his season average he leads the ACC and assists screen and roll with Dongo instead it goes to Terry his three goes 0 for four and six for his last 35 foot deep prior to that after he made that one you could see him take a deep breath like a a big weight was lifted off his chest to see one go down mustaf the steel and the stuck those are the type of plays you need to win games role players making defensive plays getting out on the break and finishing the Four Points by mustaf the only points by the Georgia Tech bench in the last two plus games I should say hold on in the last game and a half basically no bench points against pit and hes got the only four today Lance Terry with a sniper from the outside and mustaf with the steel and the slam Duncan po just picked up his second you just get the feeling for State this game is at a Tipping Point with about 45 seconds to go in the half yeah I mean we talked about a little bit how big this last six minutes is to close out close out this first half you know they they made a little bit of a run and then Georgia Tech started making their run and they were Georgia Tech has were getting good looks all game right it was just a matter of time until those looks fell and and now theyre starting to fall you couple that too with the offensive rebounding Georgia Tech 12 more field goal attempts and plus eight overall on the glass George to Terry saw one fall and now there goes the another yeah now you know it all sometimes the famous saying is all it takes is one right all it takes is one you seen another one go down Applause oconnell backing down George 7 Seconds Styles launches no good rebound Dongo A fitting end of the first half by Dongo with a first half double double 13 points 10 rebounds and Georgia Tech extends to an 11point halftime lead they really were strong in that final 6 minutes which you said were so big yeah you know it it was huge right that that last 6 minutes was was big Georgia Tech closed out the half strong and thats why they left up 11 lot to get to in the ACC Luke Hancock Joel Barry plus 10 points in the paint 121 advantage in second to chance points and now for ncy state to claw back its going to start with some defensive rebounding and they going to have to limit by Dongo who had a double double in the first half and theres a start a defensive rebound on the opening possession yeah defensive stop you know one stop at a time creep back in this game this game is not Out Of Reach whatsoever 11 points is not that many points especially when you got guys like Styles shooting the ball very well um its going to take a lot Nathan George eight assists in the opening 20 minutes heres Music Powell career high 26 on Tuesday any tornadoes inside for two thats just too easy man they they need a they need a dig from the outside or send a double team Duncan Powell will have a field day down there if they dont Marcus hill now oconnell Applause Styles averaging 19 a game over his last three middle Brooks cleans up and that is 13 points for Ben Middlebrooks hes been a real bright spot for this NC State team hes played well tonight yeah they need to keep trying to get him the ball in the offensive end because every time he touches it something good happens George to Dongo and he is fouled and if thats middle Brooks it is that is number three and thats been his Bugaboo yeah foul trouble has hurt him um he needs to stay out of foul trouble for this team as you can see right there he cleans up the offensive glass weve seen Georgia Tech go to that pick and roll quite a bit how do you defend that well it it its its a two its a two problem equation right the guard cant get screened you got to fight through the screen and have high hands once he gets through the screen and you got to have help on the backside you know you got to you got to bump in close you got to be in the right position at the right times Im Im sure you know Im sure theyve went over it many many times how to guard this pick and roll between Nathan George and Dongo but you know its easier said than done right those two guys are really talented Tech substitution number three Jaden mustaf and Jayden mustaf checks in for Georgia Tech Styles oconnell Taylor Middlebrooks and Hill the five for Kevin Keats here is Taylor he gets bumped by Terry his first foul Jaden Taylors another one scoreless today he was scoreless in 23 minutes against Syracuse only five points in his previous 47 minutes coming in this is a guy who averages 11 a game yeah hes in a bit of a slump he needs to find a basket an easy one get to the foul line just keep being aggressive dont fall to being complacent was not being aggressive there mustaf picks up a foul mustaf battling through a foot injury missed some time with it still not 100 Taylor gets his first two there you go thats a good start for him now Kevin Keats a SHO around preached about wanting to make this a track meet speed a Georgia Tech up take advantage of the Yellow Jackets lack of depth and Suare patient finish down low yeah real patient finish I mean it just puts them in a bind you know each time theyre in the pick and roll its tough to defend middle Brooks cant foul um so you know going at him aggressively is smart for Georgia Applause T Taylor Fades middle Brooks the tip no loose ball to Powell see and it seems like that right that the team that needs these loose balls arent getting them Duncan pal comes up with a loose ball with a lot of red jerseys around him Taylor the counter Terry almost poked it Loose oh Connell had a career high 13 assists and the Wake Forest win Terry tried to draw the foul as Marcus Hill will be rewarded with two shots I think they got away with one right there that looked like a charge to me and Suare just picked up his fourth four coming up next SMU against Stanford SMU one of Joe lardys next four out in that group with Wake Forest UNC one of the first four out they beat Miami today and that doesnt help you but it certainly doesnt hurt you and then number two Duke in Florida State at Cameron Indoor tonight Applause Music right now the Acca projected three bid League Duke Clemson and louville with Carolina wake and SMU on the wrong side of the bubble George drives kicks mustaf backing downhill blocked by the shorter Hill shot clock at six Dongo on the drive and fouled and if thats Middlebrook thats four and it is yeah its tough man its tough Its losing him is hard but again thats a great play Dongo is athletic he can put the ball on the floor he got to the rim if youre Middlebrook you just got to put your hand straight up its a foul there its a foul its on the arm yeah its been a tough go he stayed had a foul trouble most of the first half then picked up a couple of quick ones and then two here in the first few minutes of the second half he comes to the bench the native of Quebec Ismail dof into the game and now you probably really expect Georgia Tech to go down low and use the pick and roll with Dongo yeah yeah you know its smart for Georgia Tech to go down low use the pick and roll get postup touches but NC States got to be Scrappy send double teams pressure the ball do all the little things out there to make it tough for Georgia Tech to Applause score down low dof and he turns it over Applause Tri D really the third big behind middle Brooks and Huntley Hatfield for a while when Huntley Hatfield was nursing a shoulder he was the number two big but know Huntley Hatfield of late has had his struggles and Kevin kes trying to find an answer poked away numbers for NC State Taylor oh we get a foul and its going to go the other way that was a four onone and its an offensive foul I mean what a play by just giving up your body putting it in the refs hands to make a call charge or a block one ref had the charge one ref had the Music block oh thats a thats a tough call right there Music speak to both e e um but again Taylor I feel like he should have gave an InNOut dribble then got back to his left hand you know going back to the middle he made it he made it he put the put the uh play in the refs hands Lance Terry was able to get a call but you know the feet were moving or probe dribble a little bit give your your teammates you know enough chance to get back and make a play just put himself in a bind there for the referees to make a call or not fortunately they made the wrong call but you know if youre Taylor you got to do something to not put the put the ball in the in the refs hands especially when you got numbers like that so the wrong call as you point out but as you said it could have been a better decision yeah it definitely could have been a better decision right I I I would like to see him you know put the ball in his left hand maybe hesitation dribble you know change a speed wait for his teammates to run down the floor you know just just to dump the ball off for an easy layup its another one of those micro snapshots of the season for NY State anything that can go wrong will go wrong its been that kind of year mustaf Applause Music denied and Styles wincing at the end of the play I think he got hit where you dont want to get hit yeah the jewels a knee Ive had that plenty of time doesnt feel well uhoh the and Dongo with the Thunder what a play the display of athleticism right there now theyre feeling the shock waves in Marietta Applause Hill answer not there dof gets it back in a backcourt violation OK Connell was in the back court after doof established position in the front court and the Wolf Pack right now cant catch a break cant catch a break at all I mean there it its you know its its tough man they they getting unlucky plays that the balls not bouncing away theyre getting out hustled but what about the Slam by tongo out up the out of bounds play two hands to the one hand that could be on the top 10 hand off hand off Georgia Tech with its largest lead of the game 17 and 10 for Dongo five straight double doubles seven in the last eight games used the window missed badly theres Brion p the senior who spent his entire career with the wolf pack dont say that often about many foure seniors these days Styles playing Applause wingman listen their best bet might try to be to get Styles a shot you know almost every trip down you know just you know start hunting shots if your Styles youre feeling it your team needs points they need a momentum swing keep going and get he takes very good shots but just keep going hes got 13 here comes the high screen and roll instead mustaf knocks Down The Long J thats a jump thats a threepoint field goal yeah and I think thats something that it is an adjustment by NC State Right double in the pick and roll making sure they slide over with Dongo they make the right read for mustaf to hit the Applause three offive ell whistled for the offensive foul 14 the fou on one only the ninth three of the season for mustaf foul they say the foul now is on Huntley Hatfield its his first does NC State have a push up Georgia Tech has won four straight at home the wolf pack winless outside of Raleigh this season 0 and N in True Road games 0 and2 on neutral courts Terry drops it off to Dongo whos got 19 what a play by Terry he could went up and Tred to force the Up and Under layup but found a man found Dongo down low great decision by Terry its good to see him playing well its great for his confidence knocking down some threes making plays on the defensive end driving and dumping off layups Taylor hunts his shot and hits 11 assists for George only two points today as it needed to be a score four that time he should have instead its Powell who misfires I think he was surprised how open he was in the paint yeah just missed Brion pass with two shots coming Tech charg to number three Jaden mustaf his second 14th foul a second foul on mustaf Music Ron pass to the line shooting Applause Music Applause two the Ally ACC Womens Basketball Tournament begins Wednesday in Greensboro well have all the first and second round games as well as two of the quarterfinal matchups right here on accn and the ESPN app coverage gets underway a little afternoon at 1230 Eastern with the nothing but net Applause crew one out of two for pass and now a little backourt Applause Music pressure weve seen George get more rest in this game than the last six games combined theyve been able to do that because Dongo has carried the team offensively 21 points 10 rebounds by Dongo Five Points now from a career Applause high Styles fouled by Terry his second I couldnt see that play but Im wondering if there was a little bit of a makeup call from the last char car is second 15 the pick and roll thats worked so well man that midrange touch is so Music tough careless turnover by McNeil Applause Music Applause Music Applause theres Powell Styles tries to stay with him the block and the foul thats a good strong move by po he had the guy on his hip took a c couple dribbles got off two feet and went up strong for the layup on balance strong man hes a hes a really good player he really emerged as a glue guy for this team now Damon statamire likes the fact that at 68 hes not really a four hes not really a three but he said what he is is a mismatch hes absolutely a mismatch and even he I Ive seen Ive watched him post up bigger guys down there right like he can do a little bit of everything when you got a guy that can score in the post and knock down the three its hard to put you know what if you put a guard on him you know he he he posts up and he gets easy looks if you put a big on him its hard to for for a big to stay on the outside and cover him on the threepoint line so he is a matchup out there 16 for Duncan po Sacramento State transfer bamon ster says the more I play him the better he Applause gets Tech with its largest lead Corner three drops for Brion Music pass now with George on the bench if youre NC State do you get a little more aggressive with your fullcourt pressure I think so I think you got to keep being keep being aggressive um you know I I I really think you know just watching this NC State team man I if they could pick it up on the defensive end and then shoot the ball you know whoevers open shoot the three shoot a lot of Threes you know I I think theyd be a lot better Music off hes been the Maestro he leads the ACC and assist and over the last month hes become pretty good scorer too came into the game averaging almost 20 a game over his last eight talking to him earlier today he credits a lot of his success to assistant coach Nate Babcock he said from the moment that George stepped foot on campus the two of them did a ton of work oneonone film study how to diagnose a defense they talk a lot about managing a game sometimes knowing when youre not a deep team when to run when to take a shot that could lead to a run out so you be more patient manipulating the shot clock things like that and I said where would you be without Nate Babcock he that guy has done so much for my growth as a basketball player and listen Nathan George is about the closest thing to indispensable for Georgia Tech as there is the guy notwithstanding today usually plays all 40 minutes 100 and Nate has a lot of great experience hes coached a lot of great guys um you know he hes unbelievable for Nathan George and and kudos to Nathan George as well right like in a game where you cant really find your Rhythm scoring he goes out and he has 11 assists I think thats the the definition of a a really really great player when things arent falling for you you can still affect the game in every other way now first guy out today Nathan George guess whos with him Nate Babcock up Parker with three step back short how wins the battle for the loose ball Georgia Tech fighting over loose balls with with each other you know you dont even see red jerseys around the loose ball George continues to get an extended breather on the bench Terry open he was in a 6 for 35 shooting slump from three hes now made three in a row all it takes is one and listen if he starts being consistent with his three ball this this Georgia Tech team goes to a level hes really the key to this team Duncan p is going to give you that effort every single night Dongo is going to give you his Nathan George is going to contribute if Lance Terry can can keep on shooting the ball well that gives him another element of something really special basket by mcneel after Georgia Tech took its biggest lead of the game mustaf at the point ripped away by Dongo now finally its its taken away by Dennis Parker mcneel the other way through the D plus oneou charge team number zero thats Terry third 16 fou heres NC State McNeil Jr and one another look at it here splits the double team and one great take good strong layup oldfashioned threepoint play Kevin Kats was looking for a spark going into that Wake Forest game he starts mcneel last Saturday freshman first career start 4 threes career high 24 Applause points young man from Rockingham North Carolina where he was a prolific high school basketball player out of bounds off George so the pressure by NC State pays dividends yeah giving them a little bit of issues here Poore Applause press pass tried to force it to Huntley Hatfield kick ballot it stays with NC State shot clock back to Applause 20 NC stay a final four team last year now in the bottom three of the ACC just trying to get into the ACC tournament the bottom three do not make it as we get another foul on Georgia Tech on Dongo 11 BYO his first 17 foul it puts NC State in the bonus bronley hfield to the line shooting two Applause substitution number Jen according to playoffstatuscom NC State entered the day with a 23 chance of getting into the ACC tournament a win today would have bumped up their odds to 43 a loss drops you down to 10 and if NC State were to lose a win by Wake Forest and Cal tonight would eliminate NC State from consideration for the ACC tournament yeah they can only control they can control they got 10 minutes theyre down 11 they just got to worry about winning their ball game and stopping this man with the ball Doo recovers shot clock at five mustaf with four back to Dongo left alone blone and the feathery touch glanced off the side of the rim Parker accelerates throws it back almost a Applause turnover mcneel contested no Dongo Applause tracks time up timeout Damon stoutmire perhaps sensing his team getting a little tired 902 to go in this second half good timeout NC State right now in that bottom three Wolfpack have clawed back into this game a 70 run and you mentioned it it started with defense yeah I mean this it all starts in the defense for them defensive ENT for them excuse me um when theyre Scrappy playing with their hands playing hard keeping the ball in front theyre tough team Nifty move by mustaf hes got nine that was a tough move right there good defense better offense make it 11 for mustaf get up get Applause up Parker directing traffic and the three is good thats Dennis Parker battled through some ankle issues early in the season lead is 10 hey if theres one team thats comfortable and I use those words in quotations playing from its know with his back to the wall since he stayed yeah I mean listen they theyve had their back against the wall a bunch shot clock at two and Powell somehow gets it over Huntley Hatfield he knows how to go and get a bucket 18 for Powell Trey Parker no Utley Hatfield the rebound missed it Parker gets it back able to draw the foul does that play where Huntley Hatfield gets the rebound does that tell you its in it head a little bit yeah yeah I mean thats what we need to see more of NC State get those loose balls right like the 5050 balls they got to get every single one Music has 11 assists to tie a career high and you know bench production its a bonus when you get it mustaf has given Georgia Tech that and hes done a lot of it in the second half yeah I mean mustaf has played great on the offensive end and on the defensive end hes also made some some really good passes as well um you know he if he if he can keep this play up again it just gives Georgia Tech another element you know to trust a guy like him to come up with 10 points if need be and hes given Damon stoutmire the ability to rest George at times mustaf has handled the point yeah you can see I think that that that speaks a lot about must of how important he is to the team right Stout knows that he that he needs to get the ball into mustos hand to let him create a little bit as well so they have another element to this team one out of two for Parker and its mustaf with the rebound def NC State is going to come back whats the formula they need to get stops they need to string together three or four stops in a row they need to convert on their stops they need to get out on the fast break and you know they need to hit some breze lot of dribbling by mustaf no good on the pullup and we get a whistle on NC State foul thats a tough call right there that looked like a box out to Applause me by Dongo to the line shooting what and second foul on Parker it puts Tech to the free throw line a one and one for by Dango 22 points a dozen rebounds for Dongo 11th double double of the Season 17th of his career Im just saying I havent done a game of his yet that he hasnt had above 20 and above 10 rebounds he has played at a first team All Conference level since February they were waiting for him early in the season and then the light switch went off in February and it stayed on pass no good on the three offensive rebound Hill ball was tipped Here Comes George must Powell blocked from behind the Hustle by pass heres Parker the L to Dennis Parker no Dongo pulls it away Terrys got Powell behind him takes it himself and the foul thats a tough thats a tough thats a tough possession for Georgia Tech I mean for NC State you know they had they had numbers they couldnt convert and they gave up an and one sty Michael okell and Jaden Taylor last carry to the line for the N1 cant give up n1s if youre going to foul make sure he doesnt get the n one hey free throw no good middle Brooks back out there for the pack and he was productive offensively 13 points and six rebounds but picked up foul number three and four early in the second half Styles Baseline fallway no it tipped Powell secures a three here and Georgia Tech matches its biggest lead of the game Applause 18 George one assist from a new career high doesnt get it there offensive rebound Dongo blocked from behind and fouled by middle Brooks and that is number five for B middle Brooks hes done man Dongo is working down there its not enough to just jump with him you got to box him out see there they both just jump for the ball Dongo is more athletic got to get him out the paint yeah if Georgia Tech can keep Nathan George and by Dango and in by dangos case if you lose by Dango you might lose him to the pros yeah you know for me you know if you you know if he leaves hes going to the pros um hes got great potential man hes show hes putting up the numbers hes making a very good case why he should be a Le you know a first round pick you know he he he has a good tournament run he plays well in the ACC tournament you might you know he might we might be seeing him in the big leagues next year yeah the nothing but Ned crew will be in Greensboro for the ACC womens tournament starting Wednesday on acc Network pregame halftime post game covered by the nothing but net crew 25 points for Dongo and yeah heres the thing now with nil money sometimes you can convince a player to come back for another year if thats on the table but if Damon Stout starts next season with George and Dango as your foundational pieces and you build around that theyre going to be one of the top teams in the ACC absolutely they definitely will be and Georgia Tech might be putting this away yeah theyre running away with this now theyre putting him to bed zip him up foul charer number three sty third fou 20 points for Powell hes got backto back 20po games and Nate George with a new career high with 12 assists and they could they can have pal come back next year as well he could hes only a junior this year hell be a senior next year they you know theyre theyre not you know they they they were they get a a real knockdown shooter you know theyre theyre looking at you know a a a real rank team NC State imploding George uhoh missed the dunk Powell has his back get your bounce up son hes laughing about it everybody has those moments he just wanted to give pal a a little a little uh those four can carry an offense and theyre seen as a team that could be in the ACC tournament what NC State was last year obviously the one thing they dont have is depth you played for Jim beigh who was Notorious for going six seven deep sometimes the starters much like Georgia Tech right now played heavy minutes is depth overrated yeah I I I mean I think it really the depth only really affects you when you get in foul TR right if they can stay out of foul trouble then I dont you play zone right exactly so like when you get into foul trouble it it it hurts you a lot um I I I think as far as fatigue as far as you know if if everybody stays out of foul trouble I I dont think it affects you too much and meanwhile NC state has put up the White Flag here Dongo with a career high Music 27 been a long and trying season for the wolf pack and now the odds are about to shrink even further NC State will not officially be eliminated from the ACC tournament with a loss but their odds of getting there Dro from 23 coming in to now 10 after this game and if Notre Dame which is little injury ridd riddled as well with Braden Shrewsberry now out for the year Notre Dame finds a way to beat wake and Cal beats BC tonight that would be it for NC State Notre Dames not beating Wake Forest tonight no Applause way I love watching Wake Forest Man Hunter silus such a good player yeah theyve just had a couple of uh illtimed hiccups for a team on the bubble losing to Virginia losing to NC State and not very good uh losses there George wide Applause open its been that kind of day for him shooting like I said his career high in assist hes been dropping dimes everywhere hes definitely been contributing to this offense oconnell no good on the three Dongo rebound number 16 Applause EAS roffs Runner not close NC State finishes with Pittsburgh on Wednesday and then at Miami on the final weekend of the regular season Georgia Tech gets Miami here and then closes at Wake Applause Forest wild shot by

moves catching Ali oops hes caught him left hand right hand you know hes hes doing it all hes in position you know hes at the right place at the right time career night for him hes something special couple of WalkOns in there for Georgia Tech Emer Nichols from Woodside California and Marcos Sam Miguel 35 knocks down the triple thats the first three of his career how much did you used to get a kick out of it end of a blowout game when a walk on hits a big shot oh man its its its unbelievable its my f its one of my favorite moments in in sports you see how hard those guys work and practice and shoot around and behind the scenes every single day man they come in they sacrifice you know they work as hard as just as anybody else they give you different looks all year long you know and they never get the glory for it so you know to come out here and and to get some appreciation and score the ball is something special now its San Miguel who has the ball four career points two career field goals and hes not giving this up turned it over almost did he saw his fellow walk on get one he wanted one bad I wanted him to get the bucket Applause too Taylor with a three knocked out of bounds to Georgia Applause Tech a 206 Game ending run by the yellow jackets over the last 7 Minutes Damon Staters team has now won six out of eight could they be this years version of what NC State was last

theyre Prime right now theyre playing well its not you know its sometimes its when you put it all together and thats what theyre doing right now meanwhile NC State season hangs by a thread of Rock and silk now 4 and 14 in conference play in the bottom three in danger of missing the ACC tournament they need a lot of help over the final week of the regular season and need some help tonight time to
