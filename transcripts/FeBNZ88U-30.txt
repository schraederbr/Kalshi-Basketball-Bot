the Oakland Zoo is here and ready for action Pittsburgh with a record of 16 11 overall 7 and9 in conference play same as Georgia Tech the yellow jackets 13 and 14 overall and Pittsburgh with the basketball first Jaylen low their sophomore point guard from Missouri City Texas off to guo Diaz Graham Zack Austin number 55 gives it back to low cam corn has the pass knocked Away by Bay and Dongo and here comes Leed shot clock on under 10 little hesitation to go around Terry who recovers but commits the foul so we heard very clearly during shoot around earlier today from Damon stanmire the secondyear head coach for Georgia teag we got to punch him in the mouth weve got to be physical and that will set the tone how do you go about doing that without fing out your entire roster well yeah you want to play smart defense but you want to be aggressive on the boards when you get an opportunity to push it you want to push it try to get easy shots and transition but I think a big guy this game for Georgia Tech is Lance Terry he has the assignment of Leed and obviously Leed is an all all ACC type of player Lance Terry has his handfuls tonight well Georgia Tech is coming off a loss Saturday at Boston against the BC eagle 6954 and Coach stmy is still steaming about that if he had a bigger bench he might have gone to some different guys this is the ninth different starting lineup of the year for the yellow jackets who get on the board Lance Terry has the first two and not without mention Nathan George the leader in the ACC and assist picks up his first dime of the night well how about that pass it looked like an easy pass but whipping it with his right hand from dang near half court right on point Lance Terry finishing at The Rim Pittsburgh meanwhile coming off a crushing defeat on Saturday at Notre Dame they need this one too to turn this back around by Dango sophomore from senagal has his first point score to Yellow Jackets Doug I think for both these teams both the big men have been playing really good you see cor right there finishing look for them to go inside and try to open up that perimeter play for their guards heres Nathan George number one in Gray the yellow jackets on the back end of a long road trip they came straight from Boston to here in Pittsburgh they spent an extra day in Beantown before coming here they worked out here at the Peterson Event Center yesterday Leed off the great in andout dri everything but the Applause Finish Duncan foul finds George got a clean look left it short fight for the rebound Dongo with an offensive rebound Terry a step back three ball hes fouled by Austin and so Terry will shoot three and I think Terry is just a guy we talked to Coach STM he wants him to pick up the intensity the physicality defensively but offensively early in the season he was really shooting the ball at a high level had that wrist injury really been bothering but Doug we were talking to him in shoot around he says its feeling better so if he can get his shot going feeling a little bit better I think that it bring more confidence to his game on both ends of the floor yeah he missed the Clemson game January 14th with a right wrist or hand injury theres Terry and that is something the Pittsburgh coaching staff and in particular Jeff capable repeatedly went over and shoot around that that dude is going to make passes like that and we got to be ready well hes 65 hes one of the best Playmakers not only in the AC but in the country and to be able to make a pass like that on point to your shooting guard I mean that takes a lot of skill Nathan George one of the best passers in the country I find it interesting Damon STM says of Nathan George his superp power is getting the ball to the second side and thats the way he typically does it great vision and not afraid to make that crosscourt pass here is Terry playing without that right thumb and wrist and hand wrap for the first time in a few weeks and as you said Eric he was saying its more about between his ears at this point got to get comfortable and get ready for it to be hit again and make sure its okay and just picking your spots knowing when to make a play knowing when youre looking to score the basketball hes the leader on this Georgia Tech Team he has to put his guys in good position to score Zack Austin no cam Corin fighting for the ball it goes out of bounds back to Georgia Tech Pittsburgh now one of five shooting and weve got our first block of the night for this number two team in Block shots in the ACC well and if youre Georgia Tech you just got to keep being aggressive to the Basset your shot is going to get blocked every once in a while but you got to keep being aggressive keep putting pressure on the defense GMO Diaz Graham with his first Zack Austin tied for the league lead at 17 blocks per game good rim protection here in the steel city D I think Zach Austin is another guy that Pittsburgh really needs to look for to get something offensively last game he didnt really get many looks Pittsburgh guards need to do a better job of drawing and kicking and Zack Austin has to be able to knock that down thats a good sign for the Yellow Jack its the Duncan pow who missed all six of his threes on Saturday against Boston College buries his first from the corner to make it 94 George attack George commits the foul right here George doing a good job getting in the pick and roll draw drawing ishmail and then Duncan Powell who didnt have his best game by any means against BC but staying confident staying ready to shoot knocking it down in the quarter PO is a twotime transfer started his college career at an HBCU at North Carolina AT and spent last year at Sacramento State out in Northern California and I tell you what even if guo Diaz Graham had been making that pass to his identical twin brother Jorge who are both 7 ft tall he couldnt have made that play well though for both teams those are the plays the unforced errors that you have to that you canot have and obviously both coaches uh are not happy at those type of plays Nathan George with two assists here in the early going Powell uses that strength has it knocked away he thought he was fouled no whistle he goes out of bounds stays with tech with 16003 on the clock in the first again you want to stay aggressive if youre Duncan pile youre youre coming off probably your worst game of the season but you just hit a quarter jump shot the defense comes out on you you want to be able to drive that to the basket continue to be aggressive George turns the corner trying to play off at two feet lost his balance Austin got a piece of that pass Ibrahim Suare back outside shot clock it one did they beat the buzzer no didnt matter either way pit was going to get the defensive rebound off the Suare Miss and so its the second turnover I appreciate that coach cable but its awesome to you know see these guys go from great college basketball players into great college basketball coaches and of course that prompted Eric devendorf and Coach cable going down a long list about that game is leged hits the twopoint shot about the orange and the Sooners is going head tohead you guys remember details that I cant imagine youd remember now what is it 15 plus years later yeah 15 plus and it was funny because he he brought out the details we were talking about Tony Crockett a guy who got hot from the threepoint line that game and all season long hasnt been that guy shooting the threes but he talked about he brought out that holy water and he he put it in in Tony Crocketts hand and then he had the game of his life against us in the sweet 16 so uh I guess a little bit of that uh that magic worked for him low you know what Georgia Tech has completely controlled the glass so far another offensive rebound by nango led to the Nathan George bucket and now its one and done at the other end for Pittsburgh Here Comes George two and Dongo and back to Applause George Doug I think another thing too for Georgia Tech they have a short bench so the guys out on the floor they know that theyre going to be playing right theyre not going to be a lot of quick Subs so these guys are going to play hard and theyre going to play through their Corin denies Suare and that is another shot clock violation unless they count that desperation three everybody kind of looks around the officials called it good and now they will go and of course check it watching live I didnt think that he beat the buzzer but maybe well we talked about him getting his uh perimeter game going Im not sure that uh about that but previous plays under review for a potential shot clock violation well Damon STM as we said wanted his team to be the more physical as weve got a yellow jacket being treated underneath the basket 2hour left that is Ibrahim Suare the red shirt freshman from Guinea being looked at and well coach dmire referencing the fact that theyve only got coming into this game eight healthy scholarship players he said I dont care Ill go with seven Ill go with six Ill go with five and a half if you guys dont play tough and they cant afford foul trouble and they cant afford injuries well he just wants Five Guys out there on the floor that are going to give 100 effort and energy physicality and when we talk about physicality its attacking the glass bringing ball pressure getting up in the lanes and then pushing it offensively trying to get out and transition but Suare is a guy who they really need I mean hes not a big scorer but hes a guy who really holds his own defensively and hes a big presence in the middle had a big game in the win over Clemson they went triple overtime he played extended minutes of course cuz everybody does these days for Tech take another Applause look yeah its just one of those where you land and it looked like his knee buckled a little bit and after further review it was a shot clock violation no basket all right so we get the two reviews now we see why Suare is being helped off the court you think Lance Terry all right now Im sitting with the guy who had a desperation three at Madison Square Garden I know its the other end of the court and then you jumped up on the scores table did you know that your shot did Lance Terry know right there that his shot came after the buzzer well going back to my shot yours against you of course I thought it counted cuz I jumped up on top of the the table so I I did think it counted obviously but I think right there Lance Terry he he probably didnt think it was in but uh we just talked about him getting his perimeter game back going early in the season he was really shooting the ball at a high clip and talked about that wrist injury so its just good to see him getting back to being aggressive on the perimeter and also attacking the basket heo on Doug glad youre with us here at the Peterson Event Center Austin well he missed the three hes one of the better threepoint Shooters in the conference in fact he leads Pittsburgh in made threes and in Block shots hes the only guy in the country now Eric with 35 or more made threes and 35 or more block shots and right now for Pittsburgh you look at lineup for Georgia Tech try to get cor back in the game and see if they can get that inside presence especially with indago being the only big try to go attack and down get him in foul trouble and corins got one of three Pittsburgh block shots to help keep this to a fivepoint game right now mustaf has come into the game he spots up for three way off the mark and thatll be Georgia Tech basketball off the leg of ish legett and so with eight seconds remaining on the shot clock the yellow jackets will have it over near the corner and must hes a guy who really excels in the open court driving downhill getting to the basket once he gets that jump shot consistent hes going to be a whole different player 3 seconds 2 seconds Terry able to beat that buzzer that extends the biggest lead of the night to seven G Tech with this lineup it allows them to get up and down play fast now they just have to be selective with their decision making make the right Music play Terry who his teammates call Pops goes end to end up to steal the 24y old with the flush and this is what coach stmy challenged Lance Terry today in shoot around we know you can score the ball but we need you on the defensive side getting in the lane getting easy opportunities to the rim like that one he by himself is outscoring Pittsburgh so far 8 to six eight points now off the Lefty layup by Jaylen low we just about eight minutes into this game Jaylen low you see him trying to work his way in but now is the time for him to be aggressive look for his scoring but also look to make plays for his teammates Jaden mustaf feeds Powell who draws the second Defender nice wraparound pass to mustaf and a equally nice pass inside to George just great ball mve thats what Georgia Tech was lacking last game against Boston College too many too much oneonone in ISO play they have to be able to move that ball side to side get some Cutters going find the open man eight minutes in here at the Peterson Event Center the home team stuck on eight points and they are still stuck on eight points as is legged couldnt handle that pass third turnover committed by the p and they have had a little bit of adversity since that time but theyve still won four out of six and have shown the capability maybe not against Duke but against anybody else in the conference they can beat him hey Doug he was fired up shoot around and and Im used to those type of coaches thats how my coaches were growing up theyre fired up theyre in their face theyre intense and you know you can see his passion for the game and for his players and he just really wants to win and have his guys ready Jaden mustaf Powell with an airball and weve got a foul on the floor going for the rebound Corin and Dongo were tied up and it is against Cameron Corin the transfer from Florida State hit went to a little zone right there see if they stay in it or go back to the man Corin low Le Austin and cummings just into the game for the first time hes defending Terry right Applause now shot clock at four Terry Stay High hes into double figures already with 11 I tell you what you see a couple of those perimeter shots going your confidence goes to another level now its just all levels attack in the rim on the perimeter in transition good to see Lance Terry back to his form now his career high as 26 couple of years ago when he was at Garder web and you already got to start thinking about that not even Midway through the first half with 11 points Cory off the feed from low it really dug for Pittsburgh the penetration hasnt been there Georgia Techs done a good job of staying in front and putting bodies when they do get by they need to look at going to corn a little bit more just try to have that inside out and see if they can get in Dongo in some foul trouble Terry feeling it little strong that time Austin clears the rebound and here comes Jaylen low fifth in the ACC and assist drives to the bucket finds leet that is a winning combination for the pit Panthers and anytime you can get out in transition and not have to play against a set defense in half court its a win for your team great job by low pushing the ball getting into the paint and finding the open ish and the talked about uh when the ball stops bouncing for him what he might like to do for a career well he said Physical Therapy was his first I guess his first interest other than basketball so yeah Garder web I think that was the track he was on for a couple of years low on the switch trying to hang with Dongo picks up the foul but yeah Terry has switched gears getting away from PT I think and Doug its cool to hear what guys are interested in outside of basketball right obviously the focus is basketball but theyre more than basketball you know they have interest outside of basketball so its just good to hear you know what guys have going on besides that and uh Lance Terry was just awesome to be able to talk to a shoo around Dango Wills his way to the basket could not convert good defense Inside by guo Diaz Graham who receives congratulatory hand shape from his twin brother Jorge number 31 has come into the game Jorge is more of a 34 at 611 where GMO now with the ball is more of a 4 five if you know what I mean they both can shoot it jayen low a little strong off the back iron but what theyre doing a good job of is when Georgia Techs getting to the rim theyre just contested and making it tough for him yes theyll make some of those shots yes youll get some foul calls but just make it tough for him when they go to the rim Powell buries the triple his second made three after going over from distance against Boston College on Saturday Im a big fan of Duncan pow because a lot of players after having a game like that versus BC would come out here and be shy not Dunkin pow coming out here ready to shoot the ball guo Diaz Graham the first of the twins to get on the board back to a sevenpoint game nine minutes remaining in the half thats exactly what you have to do against his Zone get the ball in the middle turn and look be aggressive just like indongo was the middle and the short corner are the two areas of the zone that you need to attack and dont lose sight of indongo hes only made six threes this year but he has made one in each of the last two games he can make that shot he can also block shots Pittsburgh will keep it along the Baseline a lot of the time in the zone it makes you settle but Duncan P right here just continue to be confident shooting the ball and great job by Nate George getting into that middle and dle be patient turn and see what you got knock down the free throw line jump shot Dongo is third in the ACC at 54 shooting from the floor and as Eric mentioned earlier over the last six games hes had five double doubles hitting himself into that conversation perhaps for all ACC Applause honors for to shoot low puts it on the deck lays it up and in hes going left hand if he can every single time I I really love low I just think hes a super crafty guard he hes not super quick but hes crafty he has ways of getting around you he has good footwork he can finish around the rim he has to look to be aggressive throughout the rest of this game Nathan George the ACC front runner in the race for the assist title mustaf cut off by Austin again the shot clock down for the yellow jackets George proving back to Powell thought about it now puts it up Ryan Matumbo just into the game picks up his first personal foul rebounding has not been a strength for pit defense has not been a strength for pit Damen dun had right thumb surgery in late in November missed seven games then came back and was just starting to get himself going a couple of weeks ago when he broke his elbow at North Carolina so certainly that has cost the Panthers is legged consistent as ever now with eight points thats what Pittsburgh needs to be able to do in the half court give low the ball penetrate the middle get into the paint collapse the defense kick out to your open Shooters and one of your best players in ishma Applause Leo Darion Sutton has come into the game for the first time for Georgia Tech so we have seen all available and healthy eight scholarship players who made the trip from Atlanta with one on the shot clock off the window for two dapal he he cant he can do more than shoot the ball you see him working in the mid post area hes strong hes a aggressive to the rim and oh how about low these last three possessions just getting into the lane doing it in transition this guy is a highly talented guard he says I can finish with the right hand and I can do it with style very nice jayen low now with six points on three of six shooting has the Panthers back to within four look I think to your point about defensively with Pittsburgh and rebounding the basketball those are things that a lot of teams are struggling with you see offensively Pittsburgh has the guys who can score the ball but guarding the threepoint line being consistent rebounded and just getting stops on the defensive side pal May gotten a piece of that shot from low on the end line was George ACH and so Pittsburgh will keep possession underneath just really love Duncan Powell coming off not a good game against BC but he stays aggressive he showed you the jump shot but now hes being aggressive in the post a little contact finishing and then low m doing what he does best a little Dipsy dude finishing with the right hand I could go left I could go right I could kick it out to my Shooters lows having a great first half you remember when Michael Jordan switched hands and Marv Albert famously said a spectacular move it was in that vein certainly nowhere near as good as Mikes but pretty nice for Jaylen low Pittsburgh with an empty trip 6 minutes to go in the half Tech led by as many as 12 Powell rattles home his third mate three of the night and when Duncan pow plays well for Georgia Tech they are a much much better team he gives guys confidence he seems to be the vocal leader of this Georgia Tech Team and justs having an unbelievable first half shooting the ball and also going inside like it cut off by Terry feed the post yo Diaz Graham trying to take advantage of the height Advantage he had but standing his ground and ultimately committing the foul was Jaden Musto the 65 freshman from Buoy Maryland out of damaa Catholic High School in DC how about the defense from Lance Terry yeah sticking his chest in there against one of the best guards in the ACC in ishma Legette and just really taken upon himself to be a defensive stopper for this Georgia Tech Team and Coach Damon star said in shoter on this is what we need you to do son we need you to be able to get stops on the defensive side the ball Jorge Diaz Graham number 31 is the pit twin on the floor under 10 to shoot low that was a pass to Corn had trouble handling it Terry tracks it down in the corner it wasnt the best pass by low but if youre your corn you got to go up and grab that with two hands and come back down and finish strong four turnovers Now by pit you see Terry and Powell have been dominating at the offensive end for Tech both with 11 combining for 22 of the 30 Yellow Jacket points and Doug has really been Terry Powell indongo and George that have been the most consistent you know this season for Georgia Tech those are the guys who have really been getting the most playing time and when they play well Georgia Tech plays well as a team so now your Georgia Tech you did what your head coach implored you to do today come out and bring the physicality and throw the first punch but thats not enough youve got to sustain it because Pittsburg has worked its way right back into this game to hang in there yeah its a 40minute game and you know Pittsburgh is going to make their run as well theyre not going to lay down you know when you get tough but you got to continue to be physical on both sides of the ball attack the glass give yourself Second Chance opportunities and when you can get out and run try to get some transition opportunities shot clock ran out its a violation off the a ball from low and so Jeff cable III welcomes low back to the Pittsburgh bench we should give a shout out to Jeff cels mother Jerry she had spent the last few weeks here in Pittsburgh taking care of the grandkids as best she could she stayed until one of her grandsons had a birthday just the other day and said now shes back home in Carolina and we presume watching on the ACC network from one of the uh great basketball families in college basketball history and certainly in the ACC and Im sure thats something she she wanted to do and she enjoyed doing watching the the grandkids I know my mom every time she gets a chance to come and see the girls shes more than happy to take them and I say here you go mom and there is Jeffs brother Jason who is on staff as he has been throughout its quite an assistant coaching staff Jeff C put together Jason was head coach at App State Milan Brown on the right was head coach at Holy Cross and at Mount St Marys and uh then Timmy oul always in motion making noise he was head coach at his Alma M for a number of years at Fairfield its a rarity that you have a staff with three assistant coaches who were also previously division one head coaches and I got a shout out my guy Timmy otou coach UL he was coaching the Syracuse basketball camps when I was playing and I mean I dont know another guy who brings that type of energy to the floor Timo two is one of a kind well Pittsburghs in a three minute score 5 through nine will get a first round by and so thats why this game is so important that along with Virginia Tech Pittsburgh and Georgia Tech seven nine tied for eight the difference at the moment is that Virginia Tech lost both of its headtohead matchups against these two teams so the hes are on the wrong side of that tiebreaker you got to win this game if youre Tech or if youre pit if it comes down to these two teams for a buy or no buy Doug just win we we could go through all the statistics all the situations all all that win the game and you dont have to worry about any of that LE now leads all scores with is dozen George pulls the trigger well short and the rebound Tracked Down by guo Diaz gr its good communication right there by pit just switching on that on George and what I really like about Leed is hes scoring the ball but hes super efficient right he doesnt take three four five dribbles he gets into the lane one two dribbles if he has an open jump shot hes going to shoot it and knock it down hes efficient he keeps it simple and I know you noticed Eric again that was Lance Terry who was challenged for his defense tonight who came over from the help side to knock that ball out of bounds Pittsburgh will keep Doug I want to tell you one thing good offense always beats good defense I like the way you think its the way you played the game at Syracuse absolutely I mean you scored what over 1600 points you were much more 1680 but no ones known count though you were a little more engaged at the offensive end oh and we got to play The Zone and and I had I had that 69 69 610 in the back so somebody got by me that had some guys there to clean it up but sorry youre in foul trouble again mie I just didnt feel like cutting off my guy exactly hey Im sorry but give me the ball next time on the way down all right shot clock at five low high off the window for two and the Panthers within three another thing that low doeses a really good job of is just playing at his Pace good job of keeping the defender on his side and just gives him that little one two second to make a decision does he have the shot does he have the drop Zack Austin before he landed was shaking his head saying no Nate George I know you are trying to look me off but I knew where you were going Pittsburgh had a chance to tie it there the rebounds have evened out considerably after Tech dominated the first several minutes pile to the corner Terry wide open he hits the clean three from the corner its back to a sixpoint game a few games back Terry would have been hesitant to shoot that three looks like his wrist is all the way better and hes not hesitant to shoot at all knocking it down again playing for the first time in weeks without a wrap on that right hand after he suffered a wrist injury that has been hampering Applause him Lows doing a good job getting into that lane now its just about making the decision if you have it kick it out if you dont Applause look for somebody else Powell fouled by Corin its a couple of big guys meeting midair and so Duncan Powell will shoot a pair a great swing right there by po drawing two and then Terry no hesitation at all going right into his shot knocking it down from the corner hes already pretty much reached his season average of 146 points per game sitting at 14 Applause and so Powell will shoot two number three Notre Dame highlights our final Thursday night womens basketball double header of the regular season this week clemon and number 25 Lou Will tip off the night at 6 Eastern and then the Irish host number 24 Florida State in Southbend itll be a great night of Hoops here on acc Network glad youre with us here tonight first of a mens double header as Powell connects on the second 3527 Georgia Tech has been out in front from the start I dont think people know how hard it is because Terry was playing at a high level he was leading George Tech scor him the whole season and then he gets hurt and then try to come back in and find that Rhythm find your shape it takes a lot so its good for him just to see him getting back into that form that he was earlier in the year Austin hes been quiet tonight Dongo trying to save it and he does Austin was my exactor for Pittsburgh he hes a guy who can shoot the ball block shots defensively hes active but he needs guys like low and Leed to be able to get in there and make plays for him but he has to be able to knock down those open Applause shots Terry dumps it off beautiful move but the layup is missed by indongo got to be able to finish but great job by Georgia Tech getting in kicking it getting back in kicking it again moving the defense side to side its a tough Miss by andanga right there know its not doesnt take a whole lot for him to get to his spot and when he gets to his spot hes able to make a good Applause play like it puts it on the deck mustaf staying right there with him and hes going to be called for the foul little hip check now the official says it was more the knee or the thigh that got him either way the Freshman picks up the personal foul his second and that was just the fifth team foul against Georgia Tech and so both these teams not in the bonus but if youre Tech I dont know if you want to give up another foul to give because youve got such a short roster again tonight you want to continue to play physical but play smart move your feet low to Austin with three on the clock Ames shoots and fires Pittsburgh with a tremendous final possession of the half and theyll head to the locker room down by five a big basket right there for Zach Austin pit needed him to be able to get involved low fifth in the league at 52 and their numbers not spectacular but steady each has only one turnover as we start the second half George has four assists low has five assists to go along with his eight points yellow jackets with a basketball to start this second Nathan George off the bounce as it rattled out off the glass and right back through the cylinder 3730 George attack and just a little thing that gives Georgia Tech an advantage offensively is now you can put Nate George off the ball a little bit put Terry on the ball now George can look to be more of an effective score Cameron Corin in a crowd for two six points for the junior out of Allen Texas and I I thought early on in the first half especially with Suare out of the game that they try to put Corin in and go to him a little bit more often look to get Dango in foul trouble maybe this is the half that they do Applause it Terry gives to indongo who gives it back to number Applause zero Danga off the spin cant get the roll one and done for the Yellow Jack Here Comes Jaylen low well that is a great sign to see Ibrahim Suare starting the second half for Georgia Tech he gets the rebound he suffered a left knee injury about four and a half or five and A2 minutes into the game we didnt see him again and the official word at the intermission was that Suare was questionable B to come back but he came out got on the stationary bike went through his paces and there he is again banging for a rebound in the middle of the action for Georgia Tech I mean Its just tough for Georgia Tech I dont know any other team in the country that has have to has to deal with all these injuries throughout the year and Suarez is a guy who took somebodys spot because they were injured and now he comes in and you know gets injured but its just good to see him back out there competing well Suare has started now the last 11 games averaging about 20 2 3 minutes a game against ACC competition but they are still without jav and McCollum who didnt make the trip hes got another concussion and has missed the last four games George off the mark from the short corner so again down kaasi Reeves down Dorian anqua and down LC OBrien with a variety of injuries and other issues and so if youre Georgia Tech you have eight healthy scholarship bodies and it doesnt leave you a lot of wiggle room off the air ball leget comes down with it hell dribble up himself Le gets downhill George pokes it away and he got the worst of that exchange George comes away holding his face Doug just think if they had all those guys healthy what type of team they would be I I mean coming into the season they thought they were going to be competing for a top five top top six spot and theyre still right there you see Leed right here just being aggressive get to the rim good hands right there by Nate George and sometimes in the game of basketball your face gets in the Laughter way Corin hands back to low and I said in the first half Zack Austin was the only guy in the country with 35 Plus block shots and made threes its 45 I shorted him 10 blocks and 10 threes I apologize to Zach Austin Music really hes been getting opportunities Lows been doing a great job getting in there penetrating and getting Guys open he just has to be able to knock those down best threepoint shooter on the team most made threes Georgia Tech scoreless the last two and A2 minutes over for their last four and they commit the turnover that has Austin out on the run and fouled at The Rim by Jaden Musta Zack Austin is said by Jeff capable to be the best athlete he has coached in his seven years here at Pittsburgh he gave us a little Glimpse right there you see him right here he excels defensively but he also excels in transition getting out and I I dont care if you make that I love the attempt right there going up strong and making mop just meet him at The Rim but an opportunity for Zack Austin to knock down two free throws if youre going to attack the rim dog attack it aggressively and with authority and thats exactly what Zach Austin did well hes every bit of 67 they list him at 210 he spent three years years at High Point University and then transferred up and some of the boxes that he checks makes you think he has a shot to play at the next level well he has a role for sure uh I mean at his size hes three and D he can he can really shoot the ball I mean hes an a athletic hes out this world as he just showing you but theres roles in the NBA for guys like that must turns it over low looks for some help he found his trailing teammate legot but he could couldnt handle it and so that is turnover number six committed by coach cable Panthers its great job by getting the loose ball by low getting out in transition I would just go up if Im low just go up and finish it youre right at the rim no need to pass it behind you and youre in transition never pass the ball back behind you when you have an especially when you have an opportunity to lay it up at The Rim George with that crosscourt pass to the corner heres mustaf got the defender Austin off his feet and now George will reload he glances at the shot clock Powell down the lane puts it off the window and in what opened that up was Powells jump shot right hes been shooting the ball well in the first half hit three threes and you have to close out on it which opens up the straight line drive to the basket leg it rejects the screen the first time uses it the second now goes inside the coring what do they say about the guys who set the best screens theyre the guys who get open and a great job setting the solid screen and then getting out as soon as he set the screen you have to help off of that point guard coming off great job catching the ball finishing at The Rim by Cory yeah off the rescreen he he went right to the rim and his teammate found it Pittsburgh down four with the basketball Applause leget creates space cant get the roll Corin tried to knock the rebound away from howwell but it goes to the yellow jackets who walk it up and I know both of these guards are exceptional guards for pit but I just look at the matchup with with pile guard and core and and I just think get the ball inside a little bit see what happens theres a double team come now when you kick it out now you can play off of those close out Powell hes feeling it tonight its amazing the sport of basketball one night you cant throw it in the ocean and the next night you cant miss and now you got to get back and play defens if you Georgia Tech but on on this side of the basketball Georgia Tech has that Advantage with Corin gar and Music Powell Duncan Powell now yes so did Pittsburgh they had a we had wed love to have a little back and forth but I mean thats what made the game so fun you know competitive passionate both teams going at each other love it 4237 you see pits record at home this year very good at the peak they have since they built this building well its almost a quarter century ago now they have other than a little bit here and a little bit there they have been uh really tough to beat at home that is still the case here this season Terry has it Stripped Away by legot ball comes to mustaf finds Powell from the corner hes fouled and will have a chance at a fourpoint play I tell you what Doug he does not remember what happened against Boston College last game hes coming out here shooting the ball extreme confidence and a guy who really took advantage of the injuries that Georgia Tech have you see him right here just a kick out in the corner knocking it down doesnt matter if you have a hand in his face hes going to shoot the ball with a little bit of space and knocking it down opportunity for a fourpoint play well his career high was 23 against Virginia Tech last month he is too shy of that right now now one shy of matching his career high and that includes his time at North Carolina t and last year at Sacramento State Powell having an alltime performance tonight well it just goes to show you what type of player he is you know you have a bad game you could come out and you could continue to play bad or you could come out and shoot the ball and play with confidence and hes playing with extreme confidence and having a heck of a game for Georgia Applause set Powell picks up the foul his first and again Georgia Tech has only eight healthy scholarship players in uniform here in Pittsburgh tonight Austin he was shot ready front rimmed it though and the Miss is grabbed by Lance Terry quickly mustaf has it taken away for the moment but recovered by indongo and he says lets settle it down great Hands by low right there St is a guy whos really intriguing to me hes a strong big body can get downhill hes really good in transition I said earlier if he gets that jump shot going and gets consistent right there hes going to be a heck of a player George has it nearly stolen by low two on the shot clock Terry puts it up didnt catch the iron the shot clock was reset but it is a shot clock violation the officials were on it and itll turn back over to the Panthers that was a good defensive possession right there by pit defensively you have to know your opponent obviously but it comes down to activity energy and effort and guys just scrambling theres going to be times where you get lost but you have to communicate and then you just have to play with a lot of effort on that side of the ball Tech has controlled Second Chance points tonight it was 112 yellow jackets in that category at Applause halftime Doug thats a big stat right there cuz usually the team who has more possessions than a basketball game wins big three by legan unless youre knocking down threes like that I I I really like this this is my first time seeing this guy play in person and like I said all all three levels three midrange to the basket and just more importantly he just keeps it simple he doesnt try to do too much yeah the ACC Sixth Man of the Year last season now a starter this year and playing at an all ACC level boy low has had some quick hands defensively tonight off the takeaway cant make him pay at the other end out of bounds and weve got a foul call that goes against dis legett thats his third Eric Ls been doing a great job of just being active defensively having active hands getting in there on indongo and and pushing it and really he probably just could have went all the way good job by Terry but its not a bad shot right there but he probably could have got a better one Applause so leg it with those three fouls will take a seat out of the powerful wcac Washington Catholic Athletic League from St Johns College High School hell sit out for at least a couple of minutes George off the crossover pulls the trigger and into the game who has played a fairly limited role so far tonight Brandon Cummings The Freshman from Midland Pennsylvania with the Music ball good ball movement to find Corin who is still perfect from the floor well Ive been saying it all game get him the ball he hasnt missed a shot hes going to be efficient around the rim he can pass the ball out of the post and hes going to make the defense collapse now it makes it easier for your guards to play off those long closeups hard to do better than six for six shooting the basketball Georgia Tech they cant get into ISO basketball they cant let it stick they got to do a good job of cutting and they got to move the ball side to side Terry inside against the seven foot are able to initiate the contact and draw the foul who had lunch sitting outside today oh absolutely with the sun shining in my face Im crazy but not that crazy oh man it was it was a nice day to be out walking around here in Pittsburgh Music abut Lance Terry at the free throw line makes a pair hes now got 16 points he has now surpassed his season average of 146 Applause Z Mo Diaz Graham Brandon Cummings with the ball Corin battling with indongo inside for space Dongo had a quiet second half its a great job right there defensively not let him letting Corin get position and seal them but who they get for that one thats going to go against Dongo the sophomore from senagal by the way hes got an old friend for the opposition tonight as we take another look theres that left hand getting low up in the chest and thats why he got the foul call and so low is at the line and uh you know Im I Im never surprised with the connections that you find when you do this job through the sport of basketball as you know Eric seems like everybody knows everybody and they come from all corners of the earth so this is with the old Albany City rocks a team Bongo and papa amadu kti who we have not seen tonight were teammates at least for one day I dont know how long that lasted but they greeted each other before the game today and again two guys from Sagal meeting in Western Pennsylvania to play a basketball game we got a shout out Jimmy Hart the Albany City rocks founder and you know what basketball everyone plays basketball around the world but the basketball Community is really small if you dont know someone personally you know of them so its its just awesome to see the relationships that guys build just through the game of basketball and right on Q the 69 sophomore who played at putham Science Academy there they are pregame Papa on the right I cant assume they were speaking English there I was going to say we could ease drop but my uh African dialect is not so good so I dont know what they were saying two men from Sagal and again Papa has not had a consistent role for Pittsburgh this year but he brings a physicality to this team thats a new career high for Duncan Powell and he has a chance as coach capable certainly understands for his second fourpoint play of the half from that very same spot I tell you what hes bringing the physicality hes bringing the jump shooting hes bringing the straight line drives dunan Powells confidence is at an alltime high right now and again just showing you what type of player he is after coming off that BC game not shooting the ball well coming into this Pittsburgh game with a lot of confidence shooting the ball and knocking down the free throw like you said Doug having a new career high Duncan pow is on a roll right now well he went to high school in Dallas but hes a Carolina kid at heart he spent his formative years in North Carolina as a Tarheels fan hes having himself a career night 26 points in counting and he has been hunting his shots especially here in the second half well on a lot of the possessions hes had the mismatch or hes had the open opportunity so whenever you get those chances you want to be aggressive ball on dungo and that is his second and the fifth against Georgia Tech Damon stmy in his second year is head coach at Georgia Tech his second opportunity as a head coach at the division one level he had a good run at the University of the Pacific out in California of course he had a long NBA career the uh NBA Rookie of the Year with the Toronto Raptors after being a first round pick out of the University of Arizona Mighty Mouse Mighty Mouse and he was a guy who I Look to when I was growing up playing basketball I mean a guy at that height the way he could score the basketball on on all three levels shooting it getting into the lane finishing at The Rim creating for others and now coming into the coaching ranks and and really one of the best guys to talk to I Ive got to do a few Georgia T games this season and again the basketball Community people know each other and its just great to have conversations with a with a legend like that and you know just pick his brain about the game of basketball well his favorite player as a kid was Nate tiny archal and you understand why as a height challenged scoring point guard ball out of bounds to George attch STM Now 51 years old hes a West Coast guy from Portland played many years for the Trailblazers but you saw on his bio there he did spend time in the NBA as a coach with the Boston Celtics in recent years right before taking the tech job a couple of years ago and you see concepts of what the Celtics do with this Georgia Tech Team well even from their offense to their defense but also in the shoot around uh its not its not laidback but its more easygoing especially with you know the injury that Georgia Tech have its its a lot of teaching uh and obviously hes a guy who has that knowledge to be able to teach mustaf picks up another foul you can see hes not so happy about that so that is his fourth personal fou and again for a short bench that is not what Damon statamire wants to have to deal with far more coaches than available players on that bench but but its nothing new hes been dealing with it for weeks and months now yeah and again I think mustaf hes a guy who hes young and if he gets that jump shot hes just his his game is going to excel even more going to the basket and getting out in transition cuz guys have to come up and and really guard him but hes a really good young talent for geord and of course he is the son of the late Jared mustaf who starred in the ACC for Gary Williams at Maryland back in the day played a couple of great years in college part before becoming the 19th or rather 17th overall pick of the Knicks in the 1990 NBA draft by the way Derrick fman went number one that year figured Id throw that in there for you Eric you have to thats my guy DC and uh Jadens father unfortunately died in late October on his 55th birthday of natural causes and yet his son continues to play on and honor that Legacy Nathan George all the way to the basket for two more see eight points five assists four rebounds for George his opposite number jayen low on double double watch with 11 points and seven assists leg it to the left hand no Corin had it able to save it Cummings off the bounce looked like somebody got a piece of it on second effort Cummings now now Powell took a shot to the face he holds his face and nose and goes back to tell coach dmire M Ill stay but there might be some blood on that face of Duncan pow just love the the activity and the physicality of both teams theyre really going after it on the boards now Powells going to head back over to the bench and probably receive a little bit of treatment you see right here Nathan George getting off the screen pit doesnt rotate bottom side and he just has a wide open layup and Nate George is one of the best in the country making decisions off the pick and roll he really excels at scoring the basketball off and then getting his guys involved as well that foul was on Jaylen low his second there you see the blood on the towel for Duncan Powell in the midst of a career game scoring the basketball by the way as uh Dongo waits to shoot his free throws this is the first time tonight that we have had bonus free throws neither team got into the bonus in the first half so this will be our first one and one the Georgia Tech training staffs able to get that bleeding stop Powell can stay in the game looks like hes going to be able to at least for now theyre not going to let him come out of the game the way hes playing and hes a guy that ever since stepping in and being in the starting lineup has really took advantage of that role and just really excelled and gotten better and better each game only a 61 foul shooter and Dongo is emblematic of a team that doesnt shoot the free throws very well 329th in the country out of 364 teams they shoot a dreadful 67 worst in the ACC and only Cincinnati and Minnesota are power conference programs that shoot it worse from the line of course and Dango makes both and the lead is nine but it it looks good he he has a good looking form its its nothing really that you want to change its just being consistent and getting the Reps but he has an NBA skill set especially the way hes been playing of late early in the season you heard you know Whispers of him you know not playing up to what hes capable of but as of late I mean you saw the stats 19 and 15 boards hes rising up those NBA Mock boards theres another rebound for indongo hes in double figures on the glass you know last year as a freshman he made the all rookie team in the ACC the first yellow jacket to do that since Josh aogi back in 2017 whos having himself a nice NBA career Cummings off the steel gives it right back good Hustle by Tech to get back defensively to force what is the seventh Pittsburgh turnover tonight especially off a turnover from Powell they could have just stood there and waited now they get back and then cause a turnover on the other end great job by Georgia Tech continuing to play saw the yellow jackets have 10 turnovers to the seven for pit just over 8 minutes to go here in the second half at the Peterson Event Applause Center get the ball into the middle of the Zone somebody has to flash right there Applause Darion Sutton number 10 in Gray back into the ball game better close out that time under control by leget to keep Powell from making the three and the foul committed by Sutton in transition will take us to our next break lot of emotion on the floor in this key game this rightfully so with still two plus years of Eligibility remaining and really his size at the position is is bigger than all those guys that you named I mean hes one of the bigger point guards and a lot them to see over the defense and he already has really great vision but just being at that 65 66 height allows them to see it a little bit even more of course Canada has been as low makes a couple of free throws for pit quite a booming place for NBA players to come from of course sh G gilis Alexander is the biggest name right now might win MVP I dont know is Nathan George will get that far but Jamal Murray RJ Barrett Andrew Wiggins on on hes just another one of the latest great exports in hoops from up North Dango lost it out of bounds off his leg says the official right there Lee Cassel had a great view Dongo didnt believe it but hes going to lose that argument every single time and thats the 11th Tech turnover well you see pck going back to the zone and Georgia Tech got into a spot where they can be effective in that short corner you just have to be decisive when you get there you wait too long thats when the double team comes low defended by Powell tries to get around him and Howell commits the Applause foul answer a jayen low who is putting together a pretty good stat line tonight well head back to the free throw line see the 13 points seven assists the one thing about both him and Nate George in this terrific point guard matchup is that they are also on the flip side one and two in the ACC and turnovers committed how much of that is just that they are both High usage high volume guys and youre going to have turnovers and how much of it of it has been carelessness well I think its a little bit of both right I mean both guys probably have some turnovers they want to have back but when you have the ball in your hands that much youre in the game youre going to commit some turnovers but now its just about being able to learn from those turnovers and you know make better decisions each time each game Darion Sutton with the basketball gives it back to George George attack up by five with theall B Doug me and you know both they got to get that ball in the high post the high post a short Corner if not youre going to have to screen the inside or outside of that top of the Zone well Sutton got a paint touch George made the extra pass and they got a really good look from Terry just couldnt make it and so Pittsburgh can make it a one possession game step back three blows got it he puts his hands as you saw in the sign of a prayer his prayer is answered in the 18 that night he gave you 32 did he thats what the guys are telling me Oh he gave his own 32 oh there we go waited deflect e no he I mean he was a heck of a player man all Big East type player no doubt Pittsburgh on a run Georgia Tech trying to reestablish couple of point blank shots Pittsburghs going to be called for the foul and the yellow jackets whove been very good tonight at the foul line will head back to the stripe as a team they are 10 of 11 this for a team that again is shooting at a 67 clip Doug if youre Georgia Tech you can get the ball in that middle I dont care who it is and youre attacking the rim now you cause the defense to collapse on you and that allows offensive rebounds to open up and thats what happened right there for andago great job being aggressive on the boards an opportunity knock it down like we said earlier not a great free throw shooter but the form is there its just about the Reps and being consistent and being confident and shooting the ball that foul was on leit his fourth a Shooters roll for indongo and so leeds going to go out how long do you keep Leed out with those four fouls if youre Pittsburgh well you dont want to keep them out too long as long as you can keep it close and keep it within range but you probably put him on the bench for 2 minutes and try to get him back in in Applause there 5754 George atch the yellow jackets looking for their eighth Conference win on the year they and the Panthers both seven and nine an ACC play tied for eighth place along with Virginia tackle Lows foued by Terry its a blocking foul on number zero is second he joined the 100 point Club earlier this season back in December at Oklahoma and as uh we were talking to him after shoot around today again uh some of his younger teammates called the now 24yearold pops and what was the other one uh pops old head old head pops and old head yeah I guess in in uh in this era where guys can get you know five and six years and sometimes even seven I mean back then when I was playing 24 would have been old oh I was 21 on my way out so who who we kidding its still old for being in college but thats the world we live in that thats the world we live in so but I think he he likes it you know I think he looks at it you know hes a leader and when guys come to him saying old head and Pops he he probably just gets to chuckle but hes having a heck of a game today or tonight excuse me just had a pause with a scoring discrepancy this is the correct score now at 5855 and make it Music 5856 and Doug just about low hes he doesnt look really big or strong but an incredible job of getting into the defenders body and drawing the fouls and Georgia Tech was at 57 on the scoreboard should have been 58 so theyve got that corrected and then the yellow jackets cough it up again turnovers have been a problem for Tech here in the second half as the Panthers have F back in it the Zeus starts to Make Some Noise are 12 turnovers theyve been doing a good job with Second Chance points but Cummings gives Pittsburgh in first lead since two nothing and Carl krower loves it and and I think the games that low missed gave cumins even more confidence coming in starting at the point and hes a guy whos really talented can do it on all three levels there you see him showing his ability to shoot the basketball and our coach stmy was telling us that this team still has not gotten its leadership from the floor it still comes from him this is the perfect opportunity for somebody on this team to grab his teammates and say lets go but will that change the DNA of a team and of these players can that change Eric now in late February its a great job right there by low penetrating collapsing the defense and finding cumings who knocks it down but to your point Doug you cant have the leadership come from the coaches theyre not playing the basketball game the guys on the floor are playing the basketball game you know you think guys like Po whos more vocal but Im thinking Nate George hes the leader of the team youre the best player on the team and you need to be to be able to step up huddle your guys up especially in situations like this where youre turning the ball over too much and know calm them down and and and get back into your offensive sets execute and get ready on the defensive side of the ball but hes Canadian hes a lot nicer than we are hes not going to do that come on man that foul was on Zack Austin his second and Dango again who was 61 from the line coming in gets one out of two so we are tied 59 a piece with just over 5 minutes on the clock but Doug usually youd want it to come from your point guard were talking about Carl ker excuse me he was the guy who he didnt have to tell him to talk at all he was automatically talking out on the floor but one of the great leaders that Pittsburgh have had come through their basketball program no doubt big stop for Tech defensively Terry comes for the ball takes it from George to mustaf 12 in the shot clock and theres a foul given up by Cummings out between the circles some 35 ft from the basket first foul on number three The Freshman from Lincoln Park High School in Western PA and Doug Cummings is going to be a really good player for this Pittsburgh team but this is where youre missing leot in the game you know offensively and then defensively hes usually guarding the best player on the other team like it out with the four fouls we will see him come back in at some point maybe trying to get to the under four media timeout before bringing him out and there is the Freshman whose older brother Nelly played a year a graduate year here at pit after a terrific run at C gate University looks like maybe weve got some blood on Applause George hey and theres Big Brother the former Panther rooting for his younger brother who goes by Biba in the family ryell and Brandy dad mom and Nelly are regular figures at home games here this year for supporting their youngest and there is Applause Dad and youre right I mean the upside for Brandon Cummings is very high how about that thats an awesome photo right Music there how cool is it Doug to be able to have your family that close enough to where they can come and watch you play all your college basketball games not only your mom and dad but your brother and other family members and Nelly was on the call early season when kid brother went for 30 against Eastern Kentucky that was that last shot there well thats what it was his brother was on the call yeah Applause after rejecting the screen low to the right hand cant get the roll everything but the layup and here comes George attack on top by two George hoist he was fouled on the three by Corin and Coach capable is incensed and from his pointing in body language I dont think its just that call that hes worked up about he didnt like something at the other end that just was or was not Applause called I tell you what whenever theres a threepoint foued shooter yeah I mean right there you just got to finish that it was a great drive he rejected the screen getting downhill you got to finish that and on the other thats a foul every time you cant come under the shooter right youve got to give him room to land so even if there was no or inse insequential contact up top or with the body he didnt allow for the shooter to land you have to be able to control your clothes out on the shooter anytime you get that close to a shooter its its an automatic foul and so Le is back onto the floor with those four fouls as George makes two out of three from the strike well its been 5 and A2 minutes since Georgia Techs last field goal and yet theyve been able to maintain and get the lead back to four they Trail for just a brief second but for the most part they have led almost the entire game low on the switch drive by adongo who recovers for the rejection and a foul on the floor Applause coach Cel is all the way out in the lane hearing the back and forth from the coaches all game long and theyre doing their best job theyre not going to be perfect theyre not going to catch every call but for the most part theyre doing an unbelievable job well we will get you to blackburg just as soon as we are done here in Pittsburgh with the 19th ranked Louisville Cardinals and the hokes set to tip off the other ACC game tonight over on ESPN has gone final no surprise Duke hammered Miami 9760 and Doug really a big differences in this game and you mentioned it earlier is the free throw for Georgia Tech 19 for 22 from the free throw line and being 61 overall in the season both teams really havent been shooting the ball well this half but Georgia Tech has been getting to the line and knocking them down so now legot draws the foul and hell head to the line to shoot to yeah the Oddity when you look back at the two best wins for Georgia Tech this year Eric they came earlier this month against Louisville and at Clemson despite the fact that coach stms team was a combined 21 of 42 from the free throw line how do you win games when you are a 5050 proposition at the line so they win those games against the second and third best teams in the league and yet theyve not been able to consistently put together wins this year well during that time Nate George was averaging almost 25 points per game over that span and defensively he talked about out and shoot around they were physical they were beating teams up they were bringing energy and effort and it started with Stanford and where they only gave up 52 points so defensively really is where you know they have been controlling these games and then youve had Nate George and then Dango and then tonight youre having pow whos having an unbelievable game but it starts on the defensive end of the floor there two free throws by leget ended a 70 run for Tech who you see has not scored a bucket in a long time and they still have it the AC s Best Shot blocker with another Jack Austin gets up and times it perfectly again Georgia Tech doing a good job getting the ball in the middle of the Zone great job by Mustafa great helps side defense right there by Zach Austin but again another Second Chance opportunity for Georgia Tech an opportunity at the foul line for Lance Terry well Austin came into the day tied with Victor lockin the cincin transfer whos played so well at Clemson especially in ACC play at 17 block shots per game Terry with a Applause switch you talked about at the next level you know usually you look at teams youre like oh hes not the best player on the team but the NBA is about having a role hes a guy at that size he can knock down the threepoint shot hes vers his versatility on defense defense is really what makes him appealing to those NBA teams so if you know he continues to play his role and really excel at that hes going to give himself a chance to make a lot of money Cummings low and legged in the back court yo Diaz Graham and here is Austin the other two Panthers on the floor twopoint pullup now Dongo with another rebound down goes GMO Diaz gr we going to get an off defensive foul and were going to review it and see if were going to have a flagrant Applause foul any forcible contact to the head or neck and were going to go to the Applause video you saw at the end that before is an offensive foul the previous play will be under review I mean he goes up and shoulder caught him in the chops I think yeah I mean we we get this wrong all the time but I think thats just going to be incidental yeah and a basketball play Common foul but what do you think I I mean you see him coming down and they could say the elbow came out and extended and right there but they just said common foul confirm so they did it quickly and yeah we could dissect those plays all day and and try to figure it out well its its a flagrant war or flagrance but in the game of basketball youre going to have those type of plays and and it wasnt anything malicious by Dango both teams now in the double bonus dangos been very active on the glass for most of the night hes got 16 rebounds although he has committed five turnovers nine points and so legot will trigger it in along the Baseline mustaf called for the foul thats his fifth so he joins cam Corin has fouled out of the ball Applause game yeah it looks like Darius Suttons going to come in another young kid whos has potential hes vers versatile on the defensive side of the ball and he can he can hes a better shooter than mustaf so Georgia Tech comes in and brings a guy who can shoot the basketball but back to indongo 16 rebounds nine points when hes aggressive and when hes active and brings energy good things just happened for this Georgia Tech team from the beginning of the season to now a totally different inanga and again the Louisville Virginia Tech game is underway now in blackburg at the Castle Coliseum and the Cardinals ranked 19th in the country are off to a 9 nothing start well get you there just as soon as we wrap things up here in Pittsburgh now its 11 nothing Louisville Applause and now if youre Georgia Tech you just have to be able to handle this Pittsburgh pressure and take care of the basketball and its probably going to come down to knocking down free Applause throws pit going to extend that zone a little bit further so now that open or the middle of the court is wide Music Applause open five to shoot Applause Terry fires it up under pressure and its an airball that Pittsburgh Defense Forces another shot clock violation its a great job by being active in the Zone by Pittsburgh but if your Lance Terry you cant get lost out on that Wing once you see George come off that pick and roll you have to be able to come behind and have an option for the quicker shot of the top of the key 14 turnovers Now by Virginia Tech or rather Georgia Tech they get you to Virginia Tech and just as soon as we Applause can low right to the rim that time he calls his own number and finishes and honestly he can get to the basket anytime he wants it doesnt matter whos guarding with the lineup Georgia Tech has in right now theyre going to switch everything first Pittsburgh field goal in 7 and 12 minutes and it draws the Panthers back to within three actually it was closer to 8 minutes since that last one and so now coach stouty uses a timeout with a minute 38 remaining in regulation see right here just getting to his strong hand and if youre Nate George you got to know that hes trying to go to his left you want to try to force him to his right but easier said than done low get to the hole when he wants finishing with the strong Music hand heres a good look at the 63 75lb sophomore out of Fort Bend Marshall High School top 10 in the ACC in scoring assists Steals and free throw percentage the possession arrow belongs to George atch both teams with a couple of timeouts well theres a reason that Lows projected in the second round on a lot of NBA draft boards hes a guy whos crafty he can shoot the ball he can create for himself and others and as a sophomore he hes continuing to get better with his decision Mak 13 on the shot clock about 90 seconds left in regulation out of the timeout Tech got the ball in the middle and dangos pass was knocked away and it leads to a held ball and there is that possession arrow coming into play in favor of the Panthers and Doug look great idea by indago it was the right pass you just have to put it up in the air the bounce pass now you just allow those guards to get back in there and thats usually whats going to happen you have to put that up for to go get it low with the ball hes got 22 points legs got Applause 20 left alone cant do that its tied at 67 off the triple from low and a guy and Sun who hasnt played the whole game and low knows that he sees red and hes going to attack that every single time one minute left in the second half Nate George fouled by Cummings no basket well Jaylen low makes 28 of his threes he takes more threes than anybody on this Pittsburgh roster so he doesnt shoot it particularly well but he can shoot it but hes a basketball player and hes confident and hes not going to let Miss shots you know let him lose confidence and not shoot the ball and right from the jump hes continued to attack hes got in the paint made plays for his teammates but now he says its me time put the ball in the hands and make it happen Georgia Tech continues to make its free throws Nathan George is actually a very good foul shooter at 81 and Doug coming back down on the other end from Georgia Tech in that pick and roll situation Im Im Im trapping low Im getting the ball out of his hands denying the basketball something make somebody else beat you Tech is now 23 for 26 Powell with his career high for Georgia Tech hes got Music 26 and here is low with the basketball down by Applause two sing everything and dles capable of staying in front trying to face guard him now try to recover low turns down the shot for a three from Austin low with the offensive rebound dangerous pass leg it gets it missed the layup couple of huge missed opportunities for pit and here comes Tech Terry with low to beat able to do it what a sequence for the yellow jackets who get their lead back to four and how about thats gutsy right there by Terry not thinking he might just pull it out and make him follow him but he decides to go all the way to the rim with the tough so yeah you want to try to be able to get in the lane quickly if you have an open opportunity at three you take it but you want to try to get into the lane make something happen and and and thats not the way to do it right there with that pass my goodness a dangerous pass legot got it puts up the forced three Dives for the ball gets it back out to low his three is long Austin had it blocked by and Dango Pittsburgh with another chance but time is running out and Georgia Tech grabs the rebound once again its indongo and the pit Panthers despite repeated opportunities could not convert against this Tech defense well that sideline out of bounds was not what coach capap Drew up right there if anything youre trying to get a zipper play where you can get low coming off and going right into the screen so he can get downhill and look for a finish or a kick out for three and that is not the play that coach capable wanted or or Drew up they were fortunate to keep possession of that basketball and get those three or four shots based on that dangerous pass youre talking about but Doug how about Georgia Tech I mean you you go on the road to Boston College really have a stinker right against a team thats at the bottom of the league you know youre capable of playing better and then you come on the road against a tough pit team in a tough environment and get a win its going to be a quad one win I mean this its pretty incredible what coach sterm has done with this team and the injuries that they have and we mentioned all the guys that been injured in the beginning of the game and for them to do it with a limited bench and and limited guys it just shows you the energy and effort in the passion that these guys are playing with balanced attack for Georgia Tech to pick up this quad one Victory and get the ti bre
