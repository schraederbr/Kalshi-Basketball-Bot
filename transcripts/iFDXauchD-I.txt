and Stonehill Monday before Thompson comes in on New Years Eve Anthony Eids gets us underway working with Tim Clocky and Roger Ayes and we are excited to have you with us inside the JMA wireless dome Syracuse and Mercy Hurst meeting for the first time ever Orange go right away into Kyle who is sandwiched by two players on this small Lakers lineup Sadique White cant get it down and on second effort does convert and and Matt right away you just got to go inside against this Mercyhurst team Syracuse should overwhelm them on the boards and getting downhill to the basket Mercyurst coming in off a loss at Davidson in which they were out rebounded 3817 Thats by an Atlantic 10 team Syracuse looking to rebound better in general as the ball is poked clear of Nicholas Ivanowskis And its a baseline out of bounds for the Lakers William Kyle so disruptive on the defensive end for Syracuse Bernie Blunt clearly the star for the Lakers His partner in crime is 11 and blue Jake Lemlman for Blunt who can score at all three levels and the Orange take it the other way with a two nothing lead Imagine this for Syracuse You want to set the tone early be aggressive You dont want to let Mercy feel like they have any type of chance in this game tonight Where are you going JJ Stling coming off a season high 15 points Banks in his first two here tonight Got off to a very hot start Saturday against Hoffra You see like 12 points in four minutes his last game versus Hostra He just has to be consistent and being aggressive downhill to the basket Things will start to open up more for him Previous six games in a row he was consistent Score between 10 and 12 points Had 10 early Saturday We wound up with 15 And theres one pinned against the window And the Orange look to convert in the transition game Nick Kings Out of bounds to Mercy Hurst Missed opportunity there And the first sub of the game is for Mercy Hurst Junior Cameron Johnson And Syracuse You just got to get downhill But if Mercy Hurst is going to have any type of chance Syracuse is going to be turning the ball over You have to take care of the ball especially in the half court Leman lefthanded shooter and a 10second violation just absent mindedly bringing it up the floor You see 20 on the shot clock Thats no good And you know its the right call cuz its from our guy Roger He laughter doesnt miss many but thats one of the easier ones When it says 20 you know it took him 10 to get it up the floor See if Syracuse takes advantage of the turnover Zone defense early looking here for Mercyhurst Theyll show it some George converts on his first shot from the field Dayton George coming off a scoreless performance Hes been a bit under the weather Didnt score in 22 minutes against Hoffra Bernie Blunt to answer And that hits with a thud but an offensive board Back to Blunt and its there And why not If it doesnt work the first time let it go the second time Again hes playing in front of family Hes excited to be out here on this dome floor Hes going to be locked in Hes ready to play North of 50 friends and family expected His father the alltime leading scoreer here in section 3 Bernard Blunt played at Jamesville High School And then the fourth alltime leading score at St Joe Good feed into Kyle again surrounded by three blue jerseys and Roger has a foul on Bernie Blunt So your boy Roger not among those that to see Bernie here in the house tonight Cant imagine that uh Bernie will be in foul jeopardy overall Theres Pops Bernard Blunt Jr and he could fill it up And hes not going to sit down the whole game probably laughter As you know Eric when youre a parent its uh thats more nervewracking than playing right Oh absolutely Yeah I mean what an unbelievable feeling to be able to watch your son play where you grew up That Starling aggressive early Always a positive sign Here he gets caught the uh near side line trying to cut off in the press Orange going to the press a little earlier and thats a bit expected And I like it Theyre right away set the aggressive tone offensively and defensively Dont let them get comfortable turns up the heat on a team that you should overmatch athletically Kadir Martin there in the front court and around the horn for Mercyhurst to Christian Gamble Its very high assist to turnover ratio Floater in the lane from the lefthander Cameron Johnson and going the other way Only the Bernard Blunt three so far for Mercyhurst That was off the face of Kyle A turnover in the transition game Mercyurst almost gave it back Pass to Martin Hit him in the chest Levelman a three Thats his 18th of a season and that is his game And Mercyhurst taking advantage of a Syracuse turnover Thats the only way theyre going to be able to stay in the game if Syracuse turns the ball over You have to make smart decisions with the ball Giving it to William Kyle at full speed in the lane Maybe not the smartest right And a cheap foul out front on Mercy versus Christian Gamble in his first team second and Matt they need they need Nate George to be able to get back on track because come ACC play if hes playing how he is right now theyre not going to be in good position going forward in conference play So he needs to get back on track shooting the ball look to be aggressive and then make good decisions Abraham Suare and Tyler Betsy first subs of the game for Syracuse as Sadique White and William Kyle sit Kings off the mark but Stling puts it back and one So a chance at the line for JJ Stling Hes got as many points as Mercyhurst himself just under four minutes in If Im Syracuse Im not settling for any jump shots this whole game Im getting attacking getting downhill and then if we do miss a shot Im attacking the board You see JJ right here doing a good job on the offensive glass Opportunity for and one Bernard Blunt checks out Deshawn Jackson in Starling cans the free throw That looks smooth entering the game just 40 from the line Its one of his best looking free throws the whole year Follow through was just one motion He just has to go up there and be confident when hes shooting the ball Syracuse likes to press I think the players get energy out of it This time Suarez struggled as the last line of defense And on the breakaway Lemlman off the turnover Thats the type of thing thatll frustrate the coaches And its three turnover was already and we only played five minutes Nate George has to do a better job George draws a foul here Misses the shot from long range but three at the line coming for Nathan George We thought maybe itd be important for George to get back to the line more Hell have three free throws when we return Orange uneven start Have the lead JJ Starling off to a onepoint advantage in the dome 1110 with the Orange in front How about Debos dimes first for the Lakers Yeah Mercyhurst just makes Syracuse a perimeter team Make them make threes If they get downhill every time its going to be a tough game And then offensively execute set screens in the half court They have to be able to get clean looks to be able to get opportunities at the rim And then for Syracuse I think they have to execute versus the zone We saw that they struggled versus Hostra last game Get the ball to the high post in the short corners and then to dominate defensively They should be able to overwhelm this Mercyhurst team with their ball pressure no easy passes getting into the passing lanes And if they do that itll be tough for Mercy Hurst even to stay in this game The Orange who really have struggled at the foul line as everyone knows off to a very good start so far Nathan George has hit his first two and converts on a three for three at the line The pressure I think is the way they really do want to play Theres a turnover created off a bad pass into the middle Kings to George One more for Starling Booker And Matt youre 100 because theyve been struggling in the half court If they can get out get get some turnovers and get out play fast in transition theyll get easier looks at the rim Stlings got 10 points already Again even with Mercyhurst were just less than 5 minutes in Mercyurst runs a lot of sets They statistically have the longest possessions in college basketball more than 21 seconds per on average And I think thats a good challenge for Syracuse They have to stay disciplined defensively Any breakdown will be an open look for Mercyhurst particularly with Bernie Blunt on the bench but there are four at the scorers table for Gary Menchels Lakers Good steal down in deep by Kadir Martin Orange turning it over a little much Syracuse has to clean it up again We talked about if if Mercy is going to have any chance in the game cheering with Syracuse turning the ball over pushing out You can see Stling with the offense working really grinding defensively as well Sari kind of backed away and thats a layup for Mercyurst Kadir Martin has his first points And you want to put ball pressure on Mercyhurst You dont want him to be able to see over the defense and make a clear decision But right there its a good job getting it by the rim and then being strong on the finish George to Kings Air ball for three but Betsys on it and hes challenged at the rim Nice job by the Lakers holding strong there Again wholesale substitutions coming for both teams each with four at the scorers table Well if Im Syracuse JJ Charlotte has 10 points Im going right back to him Jumper off the left side from Gamble goes begging and same team rebound with Kings and Suarez But still a open look for Mercyhurst Orange gave up 12 threepointers in just 18 tries against Hofster on Saturday After the relocation Kings a miss and a foul in the rebounding action Its against Suare in Syracuse And number 10 brings us to line changes for both teams and for Syracuse Stling does stay on its going to be physical down there Just got to put a body on guys and go straight up and get the ball But Mercyhurst is doing a great job of of competing and playing with the physicality The Mercyhurst subspring Bernie Blunt back into the game Hes their leading player in every way Preseason first team all NEC Mercy Hearse picked in the upper middle of the pack in the Northeast Conference behind LU and Central Connecticut The Orange will also see Stonehill coming up later this month And leaner in the lane doesnt go for Ivanowski The putback is there for Cameron Johnson You got to give it to Mercy here Theyre theyre executing Theyre running plays and and Syracuse is falling behind You see the cuts and theyre looking at that and then theyre just not getting on the offensive rebound Excuse me defensive rebound Sadique White on the back down Missed badly but William Kyle digs it out and draws a foul Hes a lot to handle for any team transitioning to division one I mean he hes probably one of the best centers in the country as how is he playing right now defensively and offensively Hes just everywhere Hes so active Hes around the rim and hes been Syracuses best player On Cameron Johnson and William Kyle to the line Had a nice day there Saturday Almost at 50 now on the year And the first one here is fought for Syracuses first free throw line miss in the game And the ricochet stays with the cuse into the Mercyhurst bench And Matt we got to remember that theyre going to review it Go ahead Theyre going to take a look here as Tim Cloerty and Roger Ayes head to the scorers table for the out of bounds call is being challenged by Mercyhurst It is being challenged by Mercyhurst which is a sign really for me of Gary Manel saying look we are treating this like the end of the game We want to be as in it for as long as we can And he knows theyre overmatched here in terms of uh talent and physicality but uh they can they get this possession Theyre within one shot of the tying the game Yeah And it looks like it could have rolled up Was right there It might have been up the shin of Luke Fenel Remember the call on the court originally is Syracuse ball white ball So going to need indisputable evidence off this video to award possession to Mercyhurst at 1227 of the first half If Mercyhurst is not correct they would lose their opportunity to challenge a call later in the game If they are correct they can do it again And coach Mancho had the best look out of anyone Yeah he was right there I mean this is similar to the end of the Hofster game Saturday when Adrien Autry went right away challenging a call saying Look I was watching it the whole way After reviewing it theyre calling the four stands The challenge is unsuccessful They will be charged a 30second timeout So that is a timeout In mens college basketball there is a timeout that you cant take with you to the second half anyway So I think coaches think its not that big a deal to challenge one in the first half except that now youve lost your ability to challenge And theres Roger Ayes with a little explanation laughter Hes always uh ready to tabulate Got a high level officiating crew here Roger Ays works as many big games as anybody Same with Tim Clocky and Anthony Eid among the younger but his father was an exceptional ACC official for many years Cayenne Anthony his fathers in the house here tonight as well And that got one off the back iron And Matt I think the thing for Cuse is they havent executed one time in the half court Right If you if you get guys got guys in front of you execute get some passes going and get a clean shot If not attack and get downhill Settling maybe Exactly back door Good look for Blunt Broken up by Luke Fenel Anthony to Stling whos been the hot hand JJ tries to shed his defender Offensive rebound by White Turn around though Gets his own along the baseline and throws it away Great job by Sadique fighting on the boards But once you get it take a look and see whats going on and be aware See where your teammates are Feels like everybody could afford to settle down a little bit You know that everyone knows theres a lot of pressure on this team And the expectation is that you win these games by 30 Youre not going to get 30 over a couple shots and a couple possessions early in the half Theres a miss forced and a weak side rebound by Cayenne Anthony That high pick and roll action Offensive rebound Kyle and a putback and theyre able to get downhill every single time they want to And if they miss a shot more likely than not William Kyle is going to be there to clean it up So just make it simple offensively Approaching the midway point of the opening half Syracuse with a decided advantage on the glass Stling really pushing out aggressively on the defensive end Pokes this one into the back court And if nothing else Mercy Hurst will have to start over with just six on the shot clock Great job by Cayenne getting to the rim And who else but William Kyle cleaning it up Leo Hey right now Stling hit his first four shots of the game and had an early 10 points Still does He Weve seen this on Saturday Eric Deiendorf How does it change He had only five points the rest of the game after a very hot start in the last time out Well he hes at his best when hes getting downhill getting to the basket being aggressive It opens up his outside game but he just has to be consistent being aggressive Make or miss throughout the game You have to continue to be a threat With a short shot clock Mercyhurst wasting no time but after the miss a baseline violation Really empty trips for both teams here High turnover counts Syracuse five Mercyurst now five Orange by a touchdown as Cayenne Anthony has a drive and kick Luke Fel off the mark Anthony on the second chance Scores off the bank His first points of the game And the first one when he drove downhill and kicked it out That was a great possession You want to be able to get those clean shots But great job second time playing off of two feet in balance on control knocking it down Threeminute scoreless drought for Mercyhurst cheering on the drive here Deshawn Jackson again Bernie Blunt out of the game at the moment for the Lakers Kaden Ferman Long rebound for William Kyle Syracuse doing a good job of making him uncomfortable Now the shots that Mercy is getting are rush and force and and tough shots DJ get out DJ get out Nate George trying to initiate Anthony scoop and score Foul as well Getting Cayenne Anthony to the line at a chance of a threepoint play And Matt I tell you what as a former player when you get that first bucket to go down you getting to the rim you see blood Every time Im getting to the basket Im attacking And we talked about his creativity as a threelevel score A little up and under scoop finish with the right hand and one opportunity Pretty English with that one off the backboard Cayennes got a quick first step eight threepoint play Great scorers moves and intuition Not so great at the foul line right now And another miss on another second chance White just punched it off the window This time boarded by Lemlman and Mercyurst Bernie Blunt back in the game Low and left for Johnson William Kyle gets that one hanging on the rim William Kyle Sadique White have been active on the boards They just got to be able to finish the lob for Sadiq Instead its a shot Score it for Nate George Sadique was calling for the ball up near the rim Nathan George says Ill put it on the rim for you And right through the three for George is his 10th in game number 11 of the year And it forces a timeout by Gary Manel of Mercy Hearse This is a great sign for Syracuse when Nate George is looking to be aggressive scoring the basketball They need his scoring ability We know about his passing but when he looks to be a threat scoring itll open up his passing game even more music So off the timeout an opportunity here to regroup An 11 nothing run has gotten Syracuse some breathing room Yeah I think theyve settled down defensively Theyre doing a good job of talking and communicating and theyre forcing Mercy Urs into tough shots and then theyre able to get out and play with some music pace and get some looks at the rim I think people are looking to see Nathan George as more of a scorer Led the ACC in assists last year at Georgia Tech six and a half a game Also averaged 12 points per game Hes been four points below that in the early going here Well you have to look to be a scorer Its going to open up your passing ability Orange doubling Mercyhurst as these programs meet for the first time which is not surprising given that Mercy Hurst a division two power is transitioning to division one That went off the mark for Blunt Another board for Kyle and a long outlet Now they go underthrown meant for White That had to go way higher in the air One thing Syracuse has to do they have to clean up the turnovers And youve got some margin for error with the way that White and Kyle fly right Yeah absolutely But you just want to play a clean game You dont want to go into the next game feeling like you didnt do everything you could Levelman short on the miss and Anthony brings it up himself And thats no slight to Mercyhurst Matt but Syracuse should overwhelm this team and they should be able to execute in the half court and get clean looks George playing off the ball Coughs it up oneonone and Lemlman does Syracuse a favor Open man and the layin from Gamble to Johnson Oh right there You turn the ball over and then three four guys are jogging back They should have had three guys in the paint Mercier shouldnt have had a chance at that layup Seven turnovers by Syracuse so far This is with JJ Starling out of the game Kyle lookaway pass White drives the baseline with four on the timer Draws a foul and Sadi White will head to the line Personal for Mercy Hurst is on Christian Gamble his second Timeout here with the Orange building the lead up to a dozen In the dome Syracuse has a healthy lead against Mercyhurst up a dozen but theres been some sloppiness Its not how you want to come off a loss right coming in being even sloppier right They had nine turnovers against they have seven here in the first half versus Mercyhurst Look no slight to Mercy Hearse Syracuse should overwhelm them but you want to play a clean game You want to execute and you want to be able to be stout defensively and they havent done it so far in this first half Yeah theyre up 12 but they should be This comes back to your idea of Adivos dimes Execution run plays in a way that theyre going to work against the competition youre going to face later in the year Sadique White at the line And Matt most of their points really during the season have been off either broken plays or getting out in transition and playing Come conference play those teams arent going to let you get out in transition like that Youre going to have to execute and score some points in the half court One of the reasons maybe weve seen a little press from the Syracuse defense in this game trying to create that type of situation Second is good for White Now he exits in favor of Tyler Betsy Pressure in place again Im Im a big fan of Tyler Betsy I I just think his size his shooting ability Weve seen him getting downhill Hes strong and defensively hes versatile as well comes out here to guard 65 Kadir Martin Martin a solid player kind of a glue guy Interception here on the back door pass for Bernie Blunt Taken away by Nate Kings Bryce Zephyr getting some first half action as well If Im Nate Kings Im keeping that ball Im not giving it to my center at the top of the threepoint line Keep it and get downhill Heres Kings in the paint Short with a left hand runner that almost went in off ahead And Tim Clock hes got a foul And Matt this should be the first game that Suare gets his first field goal attempt right Just get your hands on the ball and go up and finish He just picked up a foul his second Kiruare has played more than 80 minutes and does not have a field goal attempt The next most minutes in the country for anyone thats played but hasnt taken a single shot from the field is only 23 minutes And Im not saying that you you have to take every shot and you get it right there But but to have seven offensive boards and zero be aggressive Be a threat when youre around the rim Go up Mercyhurst down inside to James Thomas couldnt connect on the reverse and Nathan George dribbles it out Got away with a sloppy dribble but not for long Another turnover by the Cuse They might be double digits in the first half And its almost looking like Nate George is overthinking it Just go ahead out there and and make the decision thats available to you Leman playing off the ball Misses the runner and Suare coughed up the rebound get it back And very often the Origins have gone with the oneman fast break approach The person whos gotten the rebound has dribbled it into the front court Betsy off the skip pass halfway down and out Orange a little icy themselves here of late Have outs scored Mercyurst by 10 in the last six minutes Mercy has gone stone cold Post feed into Kadir Martin but he spits it out See if they try to go to late shot clock action here again with their top player on the sideline and could play in close to the goal as Kadir Martin cashes in And really there was no need to even help on that shot at all You you just left him and found him for a wide open layup Suare got in deep and then sort of got shoved underneath the basket Foul on Mercy Hearse number seven Junal See if we can get a look as Suare gets a shove in the back from Deshawn Jackson Well again it you want to if youre Syracuse you want to be aggressive getting downhill If you miss it itll open up the backboards for guys like White and and Suare Now you get to the line and he has been to the line before 0 for three there looking for his first point of the season in game number 11 There we go And this is on roughly 90 minutes of playing time to this point And we know what his role is right He hes an active guy Be around the rim alter shots block shots get deflections But again if youre not aggressive offensively around the rim youre playing four on five At least want to be a threat JJ Stling New Yorks leading scorer in this game is back in as Akir makes both Now hes out and William Kyle back Suare gets a round of applause Certainly the bench knows the deal with him Out of the trap Back to Bernie Blunt 3118 the Orange in front Mercy Hurst basketball in a bit of a scoring drought Bernie Blunt with an early three but nothing since until this one 3120 Mercyurst cuts to an 11point game Kings hangs on the rim until William Kyle is there to clean it up Half dozen points for him Syracuse up 33 20 and and really bad Theyve done a good job of getting downhill to the rim They just havent converted at a high rate Foul up ahead of the ball Actually it is on the ball Nate Kings called for the reach in His first music personal foul and an official timeout Well be back with the Orange looking to close out the first half against Mercyhurst by 13 as we head to the final segment of the opening half What do you want to see And how about this Matt 1414 in paint points We talked about how Syracuse should be dominating Mercy in the paint and its tied up right now A lot of that has to do with neither team really getting a lot of productivity from sets Mercyhurst spends more time in the half court than any team in the country Had an opportunity here but Gamble drives and they get a long Martin shot that Kyle collects Orange out of timeouts usually do get high percentage shots Kyles got an advantage kicks opposite to a cutting Betsy but they could not get the exchange cleanly But thats the right idea by Betsy Good awareness and Kyle just has to make a better pass Lemlman rejected at the rim by Kyle Lemans got a scorers mentality Hes not afraid Sophomore from Newton Mass out to Christian Gamble Silver Spring Maryland product to Bernie Blunt And thatll get him to the line for three For Syracuse thats one thing you dont want to do is follow a threepoint shooter JJ Stling picks up his second personal and Bernie Blunt to the line Wellveraveled but hes settled in at Mercyhurst Bernard Blunt alltime Central New York great Syracusecom couple years back did its list of the top 75 players of all time Bernie Blunt was third behind Larry Costello and Jimmy Collins Still Section 3s alltime leading scorer and then starred at St Joes a recent Syracuse opponent He was their alltime leading scorer for many years now fourth all time And he still hasnt sat down laughter Proud dad though cheering Backto back missed free throws for Bernie So hes hooked up the uh crowd with ChickfilA but uh Bernard Blunts got a daughter and Bernies uh sister whos a college athlete as well Bernie been at Quinnipiac then Harkham College and Edinburgh which is not far from Mercy Hearse That led to his recruitment by Gary Manel And he has settled in benefiting from having a summer after a very good year last year for the Lakers as they won nine games out of 16 They had a winning record in conference last year transitioning to D1 White has it ripped out Syracuse by a dozen Mercyurst going quickly and another turnover Thats number seven on the Lakers And thats one for Sadique White where you pump fake you take a dribble and then you create space off two feet and go up strong How hard is that to learn Are these bad habits that come in What do you attribute it to if a guy doesnt get that right Well its more so just a feel and having the awareness of whos around you and then playing strong and going up strong at the rim Weave action here for Starling to set up the three Kayenne Anthony drains it from the sideline Thats what Syracuse needs At least they got some movement They got some body movement They got some ball movement And look look what happens You get a wideopen shot knocking it down Thats a player who had a decent look and JJ Stling throwing it out for a better and a higher scoring shot Ninth threepointer for Anthony whos been a little cold in that department Lemlman midrange pull up Tipped in the air and George starts the break Lob to the rim Sadique couldnt catch it cleanly and he missed Cayenne on the wing That was an opportunity for a second threepointer on the counter strike Its numbers and an advantage for Mercyhurst Cashed in by Kadir Martin And Matt Im not saying it was a a horrible decision but it ended up in a turnover and you had a guy wide open on the left side for a threepoint shot and a guy who just made a threepoint shot Sadique on the back now Out for another Anthony triple try and a whistle against Syracuse Looks like White will pick up the foul here And he does And I almost feel like that was a shot where hey he missed me on that last one Let me get this one up He just had good position and White comes over top You got to be more disciplined in fouling With that end line out of bounds though Syracuse can put the press in place in and off the hands of Bernie Blunt touched last by Blunt JJ Starling able to interfere there And Matt I think this is the first turnover they cause from the press If youre going to press lets get some turnovers especially early on I know you want to be able to try to take them out of their game but get some turnovers from the press Shot clock goes to 20 with this front court throw in These are like the endgame situation from Saturday and certainly will arise later in the year George operating from the left to Stling fakes now fires JJ Stling huge first half Hes got 13 And how about that lefthanded pass by Nate George on the baseline But JJ Stling he just looks like a totally different player His shot is smooth Hes holding the foul through Hes had a big first half two games in a row Remember Mercyhurst was unsuccessful on a challenge and called another timeout So theyre unlikely to call one here Lemlman to blunt Leman sets him up again Blunt to Gamble Leman Kyle with another rebound Hes been up over the rim Nine boards for Kyle already Shot clock off Anthony to operate Another turnover Or is it And an empty trip there at the Horn The Orange go into the break with a 16point halftime lead Outstanding first half Had a season high 15 points here Saturday Hes just two off of that right now as the second half begins with Mercyhurst in possession Jake Lemlman second behind Kadir Martin and Bernie Blunt in scoring in that opening half And heres an empty trip for the Lakers as one comes out of bounds to jump And Gary Manels been around the block Over 520 wins in his time at UMass LOL and Mercy Hearse combined He knows the goal is to have a good competitive half here before Mercyhurst gets back on the bus to Erie And if youre Syracuse these first five minutes are super important You want to come out aggressive and set the tone Thats a trip Christian Gable picks up his third personal And if youre Stling you just got to keep looking to be aggressive A little trip right there but keep looking to get downhill to the basket They didnt have a lot of paint points in the first half but they were able to get there and just not convert at a high rate applause baseline out of bounds for the Orange in their offensive end Sadique has it ripped right out of his hands And thats just a case of being strong with the basketball You let a guard come in there and take the ball right out of your hands Leman wheeling around the threepoint arc And now on the pitch back to Gamble Lemlman into the corner for Blunt Too strong Kyle tips the rebound to White and the Orange are on the move Mercier gets back well But a foul here And Gambles already picked up his fourth as he gets in the way of the orange driver And if youre serious if you can you want to be able to push the plays get ahead of the defense and try to get those looks But once you get into half court execute and look to attack the basket getting downhill Defensively they got to do a better job of communicating setting the tone defensively not just for this game but for the next game and then into the conference play Prior to this game Nathan George had had just 16 free throw attempts for the season This is his second trip to the line He was three for three in the opening half applause and cheering Honestly Matt hes a guy who should probably get to the line at least five six times a game Just hes a good foul shooter and just being aggressive getting downhill Again hell become a better passer if he looks to be a threat scoring the basketball Yeah you want the defense to honor that right Open up some lanes Absolutely Even on drop offs to Kyle So now five of five at the line for George Ball poked free and then back to midcourt for Deshawn Jackson Switch Switch Ivanowskis cheering Foul line jumper is good for Jake Leman Now team high scoring honors with seven And what they do say about M they run their sets It doesnt matter who theyre playing against theyre going to execute Theyre going to get to that last option Great find Great shot right there by Levelman Good ball movement this time around the horn for George and the drop off to Sadi White And it all started with him getting it to the paint getting two feet in the paint and then dropping it off Sadique White Pressure in place off the main basket again That length of White really comes into play here Stling has to recover to get in front Blocked shot by Kyle Covers up some misses Kings to a trailing George Just silly Should have threw it up in the air for him Blunts rings the bell and takes contact Good play by Bernie Blunt Hes got a probably about three or four possessions Syracuse turned the ball over and Mercy Hearse was able to come back and convert on the other end They got to do a better job of making decisions with the ball That ones headed into the first row deflected over the Syracuse bench And Matt tell me if Im wrong but if I got a guy that has dang near what seems like a 50inch vertical Im never throwing it at his knees Im throw Im throwing it up in the air every single time He quite literally is the only player on the floor that can get it at certain points He And your 50 is not much of an exaggeration His vertical leap has been measured at 44 in Would have led the combine the last two years Another deflected one and not caught by Sadique White whos had real trouble with ball handling in this game Timeout taken by coach Autry Hes wants to stop the sloppiness early in this second half That one not typically a turnover but the Orange have a dozen of those This guy is living his best life laughter Yeah Phil Collins had nothing on him in the air tonight Orange by 16 Sloppy start again to the second half And uh Adrien Autry said I know where youve been I know what you did And he called timeout Hes trying to get a better start in the air tonight Well yeah They just have to clean it up Look if you if youre not going to execute in the half court then you probably want to try to get out and play with some pace in transition But against Mercyhurst it shouldnt be an issue Again no slight against Mercy Theyve been competing at a high level but Syracuse should be executing at a high level in the half court against this team Youre going to have set a new record for that expression by the way No slight No slight Yeah that was the third time I With all due respect with all due respect laughter Leman down the left alley Leman really can score This guys going to be a problem I think in the NEC Only a sophomore Well how about that From the outside of the threepoint line a little bit in and out And he is lefthanded but its a good finish at the rim Syracuse has to do a better job keeping guys in front Heres the zone Side to side for a Starling three around the rim And Kyle was pushed out of position And really its first time weve seen them play zone I mean they might have been playing matchup zone a little bit early where they hand off but they do a lot of passing off Yes Yeah Syracuse struggled a little against Ha zone on Saturday Bernie PL with the high glass shot Ricochet comes down to Nathan George the Cuse got lucky on that where William Kyle see and William Kyle up to the house top Well I was going to say something uh wrong but he made up for it ran down and went and went and got the oop and weve seen a lot of that from William Kyle this season Stumbling Leman turns it over Orange the other way Threeonone Kyle again and a timeout by Mercyhurst as the Orange have answered off a shaky start to the second half to blow it open to the widest margin of the night This transition game is where Syracuse can thrive And this is where what Syracuse should have been doing early and often William Khan weve seen a lot of that this year Hes looking in the rim and I thought he was going to throw off the backboard but quick drop and swish it through Oh cheering by 18 in the second half and William Kyles been as advertised Matt where would Syracuse be without William Kyle this year Hes been the best player Active energy effort Hes on the boards 10 points nine rebounds three blocks Just another game for William Kyle Again he has been Syracuses best player and cheering he just plays with so much energy and activity and when you do that you cant help but make an impact William Kyle having another solid outing for Syracuse Headed for his third double double You see his points rebounds blocks Hes the only major conference player in the country one of just three total averaging 10 eight and three Hes already got that accomplished with nearly 16 minutes of this game remaining Orange trapping here in the half court trying to speed up Mercy Hearse or make it a little more difficult on them And the Lakers go into a little weave action White has to be careful I like his activity He just has to be careful with his hands Left of the lane Little floater spit out by the rim Tip doesnt go until cheering Martin cashes in and draws the foul Kyle picks up his first personal You dont see that often That was just you know bad timing right there But great job by Mercy as theyre continuing to fight Theyre continuing to play Theyre not going to lay down Go back to your point on White One of the transitions into major college basketball right is learning how to defend without foul Yeah And he has great athleticism Hes versatile Hes super active Plays with a lot of energy but sometimes you got to be able to tame some of that and be disciplined on the defensive end as well Again a zone look by Mercy Hurst with a lob and the slam by Sadique White Thats what that the looks going to be from the diagonal side Theyre playing up so high that backside is wide open every time for Syracuse Already been a 10second call on Mercyhurst in the game Nearly another and Lemlman is short on the three Touch last by Starling I think to the corner New shot clock for Mercyhurst Lemlman on the pull up Ivanowskis the rebound and the put back Nicholas Ivanowskis His brother Ropoulos was a star at Colgate Twotime all Patriot League And Kyle is fouled going to the basket So baseline throw in again for Syracuse Deshawn Jackson picks up foul number three Matt you see the backline I mean right there he was a 63 guard so he You can just throw it up and then you get some by the rim but they have to be aware of that Play it all the way out to Kyle at midcourt Tyler Betsy and Kayenne Anthony on the right side Kion off the bracket Bernie Blunt hit the deck and now Mercy Hurst across the line trailing by 15 Theyre hanging in there And look Im not mad at that shot but you can get that shot every single time They got to have some pace in half court They got to move that ball Its sticking too much Pass to no one in particular And out of bounds So thatll happen Blunt got in the air without a plan Syracuse sub against Gary Manel brings Akir Suare back in with a 15point lead Matt its 4934 But Syracuse hasnt played well You know a lot of their buckets is just because theyre more athletic Theyre bigger and theyre going to get those buckets but we really havent seen any execution in the half court where youre getting clean looks a few times but they have to be able to start getting into half court execute and get some good looks Seven assists and 13 turnovers And again the zone here where it calls upon that execution Slashing drive Good bucket for JJ Stling Fading away First points of the half and he matches this Season high at 15 And if Im JJ Im doing it every single time until they stop me Its either going to be a a bucket or its going to be a foul and youre going to get an opportunity at the foul line Stling guarding Blunt has held him in check for the most part Blunt with just eight points in the game Off the screen Blunt into the paint Suare got to hand that to Blunt on the floor and he sets up Ivanosquez for the bucket Just a quick administrative whistle there Now play on want to make sure that uh Suare was okay as he hit the deck And look Versier theyre going to continue to play man Theyre theyre matching the physicality Theyre inside Their bodies are dropping too but theyre still continuing to play and getting looks at the rim inside Suare his first field goal attempt is good And there you have it The streak is broken Thats right That one would be a hard time to break that You didnt last 90 seconds let alone laughter 90 minutes without getting the shot up Oh man little floater spit out there and going the other way with Cayenne Anthony That must be unthinkable to you Its It is Thats Thats a great word right there Lemlman in the open floor Suare bangs it against the window Scored for Lemlman Hes got 11 to lead the Lakers Leman had 21 at Marshall last year Its just a great job right here just putting pressure on the rim and the goend on Syracuse Ball hits it backward We all know that rule And if Im mercy coach coach Manuel he hes happy with how his guys are competing right now and how theyre playing This is a team that wasnt really ever in the game against Davidson because the Davis Wildcats at home built an early lead something like 102 and didnt look back George drills the foul line shot Hes back in the scoring column more than hes been of late Both teams showing kind of this token fullcourt zone defense Short corner jumper in and out off the miss for Cameron Johnson and out of bounds to Syracuse Just under 12 minutes to go Well see if the Orange can get some breathing room and put Mercyhurst away here Right now its a comfortable 17point lead back in the JMA a wireless dome where the second half has been played roughly even Syracuse outscoring Mercyhurst 1615 since halftime The Orange will benefit from the return of this guy Donnie Freeman whos ramping up his warmups and workouts Did work out with the team prior to the game He has not played since the first four He missed that music Las Vegas trip and everything since So it be good to see him get one game in at least before conference play whether it be Northeastern or Stonehill But they desperately need him back offensively free throw shooting rebounding everything Just kind of puts everybody else in their place They bat in the right spot in the order right Yes And so Donnie so gifted but that uh lower leg injury has been an issue for him Expect him back We would think in the next couple in the Orange Open the ACC on New Years Eve against Clemson JJ Starling turns it over That is number 14 in the game for the Huser season 919 in Vegas against Iowa State Outstanding Iowa State team The Orange next have Northeastern coming in Saturday then Stonehill Monday before that layoff against Clemson Then the Clemson And Matt you think about a lot of these turnovers are unforced turnovers just selfinflicted turnovers That cant happen At least that one went out of bounds That flare screen for Bernie Blunt and he doesnt miss it Long two for Blunt Hes got 10 points in the game You know what Im cheering for Bernie Blunt right now because hes playing in front of his family Its just awesome to be able to come back play in the dome and have your mom and dad and a whole bunch of family members watch you play You you you wanted to see the kid do well Betsy with one off the back Its not always easy Eric You know the deal Sort of the homecoming type game and all that goes into it off the court and the buildup can frequently be a mixed bag Sometimes guys light it up and other times you know certainly Bernie Blunts having an okay game but the fact that hes not you know going for 30 is not a terrible surprise Yeah right And I didnt think anyone thought he was going to come here and have 30 vers Syracuse but just to come in and have a good game in front of your family and have a story to tell Merciers not going away Its been about a 15point game the entire second half One bailed out by his teammate Sha Lang getting his first run Five on the timer Tough shot for Blunt deflected by Nathan George and the Orange the other way Anthony created draws the contact That is what he can do Another chance on a threepoint play for Cayenne Anthony I just love the creativity by Anthony You see right here he keeps the ball low sweeps it through plays through the contact finishing with the right hand And we got to mention hes still only a freshman I I think people think just because hes Melo son that hes a a veteran or something like that This guy is having a really good freshman year and with all the expectations they have coming in I think hes done a pretty good job of meeting him Gamble fouls out for Mercyhurst and Cayenne to the line You know for me that play starts when he gets the ball above the threepoint line He was lining it up Its an aggressive take and a scorers mentality 10 points now for Cayenne Right Defense wasnt set He recognized it and he attacked Nate Kings often draws the toughest perimeter defensive assignment Hes on Lemlman here Frequently its been Starling but now George against Bernie Blunt and a foul as Blunt goes baseline on the Kier Suare picks up his third For Suare right here you got to put your foot on the baseline and not let him turn the corner Nothing That doesnt even happen Okay with Blunt out of the game We blunts in the game now but he and Leman twoman game Theres a deep one from Bernie Blunt It misses badly and Suare runs it down JJ Starling set to return for Syracuse George a Sidewinder tip down to Blunt I I just dont like the shot No passes You just come down and shoot You can get that shot anytime Yeah One looking to create against the freshman Ivanowskis He had Anthony on him and packed him down to the block to score And if I think Im going to say one thing about Cayenne is you want to see him get better on the defensive side of the ball He has the length at 67 66 He has to get a little bit more physical but he could be an elite defender as well Certainly has the frame for it Its the physicality and the transition into the college game that are so important to the foul line to the dotted line and right to the cup for Cayenne Youre not worried about him at this end of the floor Yeah great job of just getting to that elbow area and now you dont have too much far to go and sweep and attack the rim Good finish by Cayenne That one get Betsy with his hand in the cookie jar First foul on Tyler Betsy And Matt I think Betsy is one of the better defenders on Syracuse You see him guarding one through four Offensively I like to see him drive the ball more because when we see him drive the ball hes had success especially with that strong body and being able to get to the line Hes played a little more like a threepoint specialist Great deal of his field goal attempts have been threepointers which is a high threepoint rate Mercy Hurst ball and the cushion for Syracuse 18 matching their largest of the game but the Orange havent been able to blow the doors off this one just yet Going into Ivanowskis and out of bounds Ivanowskis father Thomas played for Manel at UMass LOL back in the day LOL has also since gone division one but it was division two when Manel was the coach there Hes made seven appearances in the NCAA tournament including a recent streak where Mercyhurst made it five years running A lot of success at the D2 level and I think hell have a lot of success at the D1 level They just need time to get those guys in Mercy again so patient Theyll change their sets You can hear him kind of yelling on the offensive end changing the play call on the fly Ivanowskis in deep with the left denied and Sadique brings it up Sadis not stopped Couldnt finish right at the cup And Ivanowskis boards the miss If Im Sadi Im not going away from the rim Im playing off of two feet and dunking on somebodys head Yeah he could have really put it down on somebody there Leman above the foul line Leman can stroke it 13 for him I like Lemans game He He has a good handle on it He gets to his spots and like you said he can shoot the ball this time Sadique doesnt mess around And thats what were talking about right there If youre going to get to the rim at 68 6ix9ine none of that soft finesse stuff Go up and put it on somebodys head James Thomas to Jackson Little confusion there for Kaden Furman who hasnt played much Three on the timer Lemlman from distance Knocked to the floor and Furman gets it back Lemlmans got a pass on the drop off Thats on the aisle again Denial at the rim by Kyle Losing his headband in the prey Threeon one Out to Stling His line drive is no good Another quick shot off the break but a high percentage shot Oh thats one for starting where he can pump and just get all the way to the rim Yeah right Had the advantage I guess is the way I was trying to phrase it there If you missed it you probably would have gotten the rebound In this case they actually did not 10 on the timer for Mercy Hearse They have Bingmpington next Theyll go home to Erie tonight Back to Bingmpington later in the week Ivanowski gets a little bump as he fades away Havent heard a lot of whistles from uh Anthony Eids but the foul here is on Nate Kings his second And heres Sadi going parumpa pump Yeah if Im 69 Im putting on somebodys head especially with the athletic ability that Sadique White has Send it home young fella Its an 18point Syracuse lead matching their widest margin of the game to this stage and the Orange spreading it around the way the game has dictated it JJ Stling got off to a great start but everybodys eating tonight Yeah four guys in double figures and youd hope they could try to do that every single game but its just an example of guys being aggressive getting downhill You love to see Nate George scoring the basketball now We music talked about that open up his passing ability but great job by JJ being aggressive and and Cayenne and then I mean Mr Reliable William Kyle Well I mean its just another day for him 10 points nine rebounds five blocks and how about this Five for five from the field Yeah he typically shows very close to the basket as a free throw is missed by Nicholas Ivanowskis Grew up in Chicago Mentioned his older brother started his career at Northwestern before coming here to Colgate and finished at Cincinnati Oscus makes the second of two And Matt you would think William Kyle has a chance to you know break the field goal percentage record for Syracuse in a season I I know it might have been held by my former roommate Orenz Anowaku He shot like Yeah close to 70 Yeah Yeah 60 68 from the field Kyles in the low 70s right now and only getting higher Six of six in this game What I love about him is he just he he doesnt do what he cant do right He keeps it simple play through the contact finish at the rim finish it strong and then hes just How about this Does it on both ends Oh and JJ has it go off his foot and out of bounds His motor never stops Number 11 Well the big fella getting out in the passing lane I mean we talked about it every game with him His motor is just ongoing I mean he gives 100 effort every single game When you play that hard you cant help but make an impact in a positive way I think there was an initial reaction in the offseason in the roster building period where people were like Well wait a minute Youre going to play with a guy at center listed at 69 He plays way bigger than that And Adrian Autry knew it from the beginning And Im not going to lie I I didnt know too much about him being a West Coast guy right Came from UCLA My question is how the heck did he get any playing time at UCLA Yeah they had a couple of other big people and uh foul here is on Sadi White but originally obviously underrecruited when youre talking about starting at South Dakota State an exceptional leaper Kyle and the skills have come secondarily but uh athletically hes second to none Well hes given himself a chance to play at the next level you know just with his activity and his athleticism You think about guys like Kenneth Reed Ben Wallace you know that type of role at the next level for William Kyle Yeah Fared is a a great comp You can just see if he resigns himself And of course at the NBA level the guy youre passing it to is probably going to make the shot You know if you just go around hunting and you can stick around What a great teammate a guy like William Kyle would be to have And hes actually a pretty good passer as well get a little pressure put on here and the Orange beat it easily up the near sideline Sadique created the contact there and laid it in Its just shy of his career best You know what He just plays with so Im laughing because the little flex he had right there but he plays with so much passion You know last game he got that technical for for talking a little bit of trash but this guys an NBA prospect Hes going to continue to get better and better each game Leman doesnt miss So hes having himself a night just three off of his career best 18 in the JMA wireless though Nice claim to fame for Jake Leman as we get a whistle and its headed the other way Lemlmans career best was 21 against Marshall This Mercyhurst team has really challenged itself with scheduling They played West Virginia They played Northwestern They beat Lyola of Chicago Hung right in late against Miami of Ohio whos picked near the top of the MAC this year Hes done a great job of just being poised in control taking care of the ball and taking advantage of the opportunities Matt hes trying to get his NIL as well Bernie Blunt from Jamesville laughter Puts that through His father an alltime Red Ram great George behind the back into the paint Kyle wont be denied Draws a foul and scored the goal Looking like a career type night for William Kyle Doing a little bit of everything Hes been on the glass and getting the rewards as well All right Lets go baby cheering stage playing in the JMA wireless dome just off his careerhigh Hes got 18 points doing it in a number of ways Oh hes been a confident player out here tonight and hes trying to get a NIL bag as well but hes been doing a good job of handling the ball making good decisions getting to his spots knocking down shots and just being compoed out there for Mercy Great game overall by Leman Off that a quick bucket for the Q to get a 16point lead Four minutes to go Syracuse to get to seven and four with Nor Eastern and Stonehill still to come in the nonconference slate Bernie Blunts had a difficult night Three on the shot clock Leman too late at that pass Martin could not get a shot off in time Shot clock violation is the first of the night for either team Up next for Gary Manels team theyll return here to Central New York to play Bingmpington Saturday and open with FDU in NEC action Little bump William Kyles first field goal miss of the night is boarded by Kaden Ferman And Matt if Mercer competes like this they continue to execute and run their sets theyre going to be dangerous in their league LIU was the unanimous preseason number one pick in the NEC And a good shot for Leman as he matches his career best showing with 21 points Well just like you were saying off air co coach Manzels like Hold on laughter relax a little bit We need you here See what he can do You know really a game against Bingmpington is one where they could have more competitive hopes as Sadi White runs right up the back of Bernie Blunt in the open floor And look were not telling tales out of school Gary Menel and other coaches at their level their circumstance of transitioning into Division One Theyre not even eligible for the NCAA tournament this year no matter what So they go out and they prep their team with these type of games early in the year They get a couple of checks Uh helps their budget It uh is like lifting heavier weights for their team and then they get into conference play It really makes it hard to recruit if if what are you really help to recruit You get to play at Syracuse and West Virginia Well but you dont youre not eligible for the tournament So you know thats thats tough right there But I mean just goes to show you coach Mandelys done a great job with this program Blunt wanted a foul and at the other end the whistle is against Mercyhurst Lemlman sending Nate Kings to the line Yeah thats the tradeoff Everybody knows what theyre getting into in this situation and thats why transitioning teams often look or feel small Its because they have some of their roster was recruited under the premise of division 2 Le Moiness in that same boat and these programs have had success at the division 2 level Mercy Hearse is not far removed from an Elite 8 run at that level Theyve just had backtoback seasons of 25 wins a piece These are the teams that are in their transition process including the Dolphins right here in Syracuse Yeah speaking of Le Moy coach Champion hes done a great job over that Le Moy really building up that program Gave Syracuse all it wanted last year to open the season Step back in the corner Starling the long rebound for a Kings breakaway cheering First field goal for Nate Kings in the game on the dunk Taco Bell White with good defense there against the much smaller blunt Then a block called as uh Blunt was twisting and turning and Nate Kings hit the floor picking up his third personal Nate Nate Kings has been pretty consistent this season for Syracuse on both ends Not shooting the ball great but he does a really good job of putting his head down and getting downhill and and being strong when he gets to the rim Helps the Orange on both ends of the floor not just the threepoint shooter that he was buil as And keep in mind I think we probably underpublicized this Theres the perception oh we played at Oregon State Thats po Its not really power conference right now When you think about what Oregon State Washington State are doing theyre playing in the West Coast Conference Theyre theyre not playing USC and UCLA and Washington and Oregon and uh they may play Oregon Oregon State obviously but uh theyre not playing those teams that have moved on to the Big 10 And the Pack 12 has disintegrated So its not quite the level that Kings was at last year Wellveraveled and finding a home here in Syracuse And you know what And another holiday jam for Sadique White And Nate Kings hes hes a good decision maker He keeps it simple and hes going to compete at a high level every single game Hes going to bring that energy Right to the basket goes near Martin A little too easy there Ricochet to the floor Kings wins it Puts the pedal down Kings to the backboard and finish it Wanted the foul which he did not get But in the final minute the Orange restore an 18point lead Well Matt if youre Syracuse youre trying to score as much as you can You Youre trying to get this lead up Remember they were only up theyre up 16 at the half and so its been only a couple in the second half Levelman the key reason that Mercyhurst has kept it respectable Good move to the basket for him 23 points Were just going to go here and Sadique White will do it Yeah if Im Syracuse Im trying to get another bucket Kings for three Gadir Martin the rebound Shot clock off now Thats good for Ivanowskis Mercyur super aggressive here late in the game Ivanowskis gets the double figures and not the way you want to end the game if youre Syracuse Now down to 14 and Nathan George will dribble it out Its a 14point margin in the end as Syracuse wins 7662
