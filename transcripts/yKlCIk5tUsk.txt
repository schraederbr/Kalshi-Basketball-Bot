dominating You never know though on any Saturday afternoon in college basketball Mike Jamitzky And you know what With uh with Abu in the starting lineup its the first tip theyve won all year which is exactly what Will Wade wanted That was Copelan who stumbled down at the top of the key Eric Lewis Mark Schneer Isaac Bennett are officials Theres first year head coach for the pack Will Wade in his 12th overall in the collegiate ranks It was interesting Tommy Yesterday they spent a lot of time really wiping the court down Keep an eye on that See if theres anything as the game goes on Copeland needs a safety valve and he finds it Van Allen Luben playing 100th career game Shot clock down to four Holloway off the mark and the Bulldogs want to run Not a great offensive set for NC State to start the game Both pack five and three on the season They are 40 undefeated at Lenovo Center Taylor steps into a three to match the jersey number Ibub high for the rebound and he brings a little bit of an edge to this lineup Mike Yeah And you know said hes going to do something out there and uh you know he just he needed a catalyst with this team especially to start the game So he is in there for Paul McNeel Jr who had started every game along with the rest of this lineup for all of the season so far for NC State cheering Ibu against two defenders had it pried away Big guy puts it on the floor and there he gets in trouble Justin Wright cheering had it blocked Van Allen Luben got back in position Copelan swooping to the rim Couldnt calculate the angle Ibup had the position and a foul coming up against the Bulldogs Well Ben Allen Lubman doing a terrific job chasing this play down You see number 22 not giving up on it and uh all just enough of the body to slow that play down Terrific defensive transition DJ Patrick picked up the foul for UNC Asheville Yeah I would look for Abubet to be more of a screener out there in this offense and to get on the offensive glass cheering Tried to clean up the Hollowman miss and the basket is waved off Yeah theyre going to call it on him on over the back First foul on Scotty Ibubine Illinois suburb of Chicago So he may not be the most heralded guy they have coming in this year but he he practiced as hard as anybody yesterday and hes getting rewarded for it here Nine transfers for NC State six played on NCAA tournament teams from a year ago and all won at least one game in the NCAA tournament Shot clock to five cheering Solomon featured him at the top of the broadcast It bounces out Luben had the clearance Williams gave it up Guadier Copelan Luben beyond the arc This is theyve got some bigger wing players and you know especially with Copelan they can post him up inside use his size Ball goes out of bounds and stays with the Bulldogs NC State top threepoint shooting team in the ACC despite the miss last trip down the floor Ibu coming out of the game Welcome to CW Courtside Saturday presented by All State Youre in good hands This is a Nashville team They shoot a very good percentage from three but they dont take a lot of them Matt Ael came into the game for NC State That was blocked by Williams Threepointer is good from Justin Wright to clean up things And talked about them shooting Hes 50 on the year from three coming in cheering Thats his 15th made three Mike he leads the team in that category Williams along the baseline and Ben Allen Luben found him for two Well the great thing you like about Luben there is hes looking for cutters Hes got the ball Hes patient and uh just great baseline cut Quick shot from the corner in front of the NC State bench It is picked up by Copelan Vladier Copelan last year at Mcnes with coach Wade two years prior with Syracuse Off that glass and good and Copeland will go to the free throw line And theres the size we talked about uh tried to post him up earlier but very good off the dro on NC State seeing a bigger basket in the last couple games than this young man right here 25 points a game in his last two Led the team with 22 points at Auburn midweek That was a loss in the ACC SEC challenge 8373 Taylor picked up the foul for the Bulldogs is second Copeland unable to finish off the old school threepoint play The ACC SEC challenge ended up 97 Much closer than a season ago SEC once again coming out on top in the challenge On the weak side it gets batted around into the corner Copeland let it go out of bounds It was a good decision Well Auburn in that game had as good a shooting night as Ive seen in a long time from a team across the board Kevin Overton had 22 or 29 rather and Keshan Hall had 28 points to lead the way In fact Overton and Williams for NC State were teammates last year at Texas Tech the team that made the regional finals NC State trying to return to the ACC tournament did not qualify a season ago after a final four trip two years ago Kevin Keats Williams being unselfish here early on He had that nice back door layup but good pass there Patrick for three and its all net He stayed a little slow closing out on the shooters Pack has lost two in a row three of their last four Theyve also been out rebounded in their last four games Trying to work it inside too strong Luben Well and this a state team too that really has to start to defend without fouling as well Thats been an issue with them with the opponents and free throw attempts Patrick got it back He just hit a threepointer for the Bulldogs Mike Morurell their head coach longest tenure coach in the Big South And weve got a wedgie and a foul and a commercial Solomon was driving and the ball got wedged up on the rim 64 Asheville careerhigh with 28 points and he is currently on the bench for NC State Well well and theres the last two games we talked about 25 points spur and uh you know helps have him come in a guy whos played with Will Wade the last couple years and you know for have a familiarity with what he wants done and to vocalize that and he is a an extremely vocal person in practice NC State coming off its first ever trip to the Maui Invitational last week November 24 to the 26 a loss to Satan Hall a win against Boise State the loss to Texas 102 to 97 Matt Ael on the handles gives it up trying to work inside to the rim Up and in Musa A little bit more of a scoring punch in there right now at center This is White with the pull up midrange and he hits it I tell you what Asheville looks very comfortable here going up and down and in their offense early Wright has an early five points in the first half from Lenovo Center Thats Arsenal Lost it on the baseline Good hands on the drive David Hermes ready to make the play for the Bulldogs Hes down low Solomon back his way against Sier holding his ground Three players now Four players to the deck to try to grab it And the possession arrow will favor the Asheville Bulldogs And that is a that is a long way Tom back the ball down Youre watching CW Courtside Saturday presented by All State Youre in good hands Solomon trying to get something going but uh you know when youre trying to back it in from 17 ft there are just too many hands involved Solomon trying to chase this one down at midcourt and it goes out of bounds Its just the first turnover for Mike Morells team Looking for their first road win of the season Four and four overall 0 and3 away from Asheville You know its amazing to me how many turnovers you see on underneath underline out of bounds plays The teams that have trouble getting the ball in in that situation McNeel angular rebound picked up by Justin Wright So Paul McNeel Jr who had started every game prior to this afternoon is into the lineup for NC State Right Thats been his spot Mike Yeah and uh just kind of drive and pitch offense with this team and right cheering set up shop right there in that right side of the lane So right now with eight points hes connected on both of his threepoint attempts lead the team with 16 made the season As Mike Jaminsky said he shoots 50 from beyond the arc and hes been dangerous so far Copeland fires it out to McNeel Jr Shot clock is winding down He lost the handle Clark able got back Might have tipped it away Here comes McNeel Jr Foul on the drive to the rim Arsenal will go to the free throw line First on Hermes A nice job Thats the second time that State has tracked the play down from behind and gotten a block shot Will Wade in his first year as the head coach for NC State couple of years as the head coach at McN music Two tournament championships with that team Two trips to the NCAA tournament Well and you know its its a little bit easier with the portal when you get a job in the springtime to put a team together now Its its thrown a lot of new faces together but it can be done despite the miss by Arsenals team early on in the season Granted Mike 77 is a team for the stripe and that leads the ACC Yeah And I and I think going forward obviously hes going to have an idea of who you know hes going to have an eye on players who he wants to plug in and uh you know still theres still a lot of value to a freshman class I mean this years freshman class across the country is really good Last year coach Wades MCNE team in the NCAA tournament as a number 12 seed Won in the first round against number five seed Clemson 6967 then lost to Purdue in the second round And thats a traveling violation Back to the pack Yeah right Dribbled right into that Came over half court picked the ball up and theres a a look at Mike Morurell and and his hes had a terrific run at Nashville three straight years or 20 or more wins in a season cheering and in 2023 the Big South tournament champs 120 career victories for coach Morell in his eighth year Copeland stutter step and go the kick They work the perimeter Able trying to chisel his way right on the weak side Well you Asheville is really locking in on threepoint shooters making them put the ball on the floor They They just dont want to start giving up big shots outside Theyll take the layup or the drive Justin Wright has made those big shots outside Couple of threepointers trying to drive it to the team of the NC State How do they do it Gman I dont know That was that was a oneon three exhibition by Ree at the other end That spins off for Copeland Came right to Arsenal to keep it alive And State has had some good looks inside They just have nothing going on 0 of five now from beyond the arc And Copeland can hit the threes Cop shoots 57 from beyond the arc Big Neil Arsenal had a little bit of daylight Takes the shot and misses NC State went by three of 14 in field goal attempts after that last minute Patrick with the volleyball out to Jones Cutter down the lane Solomon Copeland got a lot of the ball and a piece Toy Solomon First foul on Copeland Well take a timeout So he is four of six shooting The rest of the team Mike one of eight so far in the game Justin right so far and he uh and interesting that the three he took from the left side of the floor he missed he needs to get back over to his spot that Lenovo center logo just to the right of our broadcast position courtside here at Lenovo Center and Solomons at the free throw line for the Bulldogs Oh yeah courtside We love it Absolutely love being with our outstanding and talented production crew on the CW Just getting rolling this season in

this month Remember last year he had some early games that first week in December Alan Breed is into the game as well for NC State Heres number seven Havent heard a lot from Williams quite yet That jumper misses on the weak side Luben traveled Oh theyre going to call a foul Mayfield picks up the foul His first Dont forget more action next Saturday North Carolina USC Upstate from the Dean Dome Theres a threepointer Trey Hollowman has it for NC State One of the cleaner looks theyve had And Im waiting for Williams to become a little more aggressive offensively He had a nice pass that time I think he hit him to score the ball Trey Hollerman spent three years at Michigan State Was a captain last year 10sec count Did not beat the clock applause You dont see that a lot And that was just some pressure up the court but also they were a little casual getting the ball in the back court Yeah hes look at Yep was 10 seconds Here it is And they were caught off caught off guard a little bit by this pressure You see theres only two bodies in the back court They had no outlets to pass to Breed did a lot of that defensive work to cause the violation And thats the type of play that Will Way would like to see more of from his team Theres Hollowman just hit a three Now hes got two with the scoop for Trey Hollowman And theyre going back to that Asheville more prepared Solomon bounces out cheering Hollowman at one end Solomon at the other Yeah On the road against a press you get a shot like that you got to knock it down Holmans team at Michigan State Lost in the regional final to Auburn Lets go to the final four Over the top Luben applause and cheering right going to be called Hes a smaller guy Caught inside trying to block out Just went underneath Luben Luben is the leading rebounder for this NC State team Wright picking up the personal his first Luben averages about seven rebounds per game Just over 12 points per game a year at Vandy a year at Notre Dame Mike Moral cant afford to have him pick up his second So getting him a little time maybe to get under the 8minute TV medium timeout Nice What a pass cheering Dang with the jam That gets the crowd into it a little bit which is what they needed on a early Saturday afternoon cheering Just a moment ago it was 147 Thatll be deflected out of bounds and stay with the Bulldogs 70 run right now for NC State They actually had they had a couple of big guys open but uh great job by him just finding the open spot following the driver inside and becoming available Jerry Dang in the ACC last year in Florida State Whistle stop play Foul call block cheering Breed picks up the foul for NC State You know that that that was a play the crowd wanted that that when that arm gets extended usually is called you know against the against the offense This program for UNCC Asheville 21 and 11 last year tied for second in the Big South with an 11 and five record into the corner for Brie He got bumped It was DJ Patrick Last couple of possessions Tom that uh NC State has really been locked in defensively music Much better effort on that end of the floor and theyre going to be shooting the bonus for the rest of this half NC State just one of three for the free throw line so far in the game We mentioned theyre the top team from the stripe by percentage in the ACC so far in the early part of the season Its the ninth game for NC State Also for UNCC Asheville as well Breed at the free throw line this Tuesday Fight night on NXT as the rising stars of WWE throw down and high impact matchups you cant miss action intensity and the next generation of superstars coming your way every Tuesday right here on the CW We got a little bit of a throwdown right here Mike between NC State and UNCC Asheville which has never beaten the Pack in 19 previous tries Yeah And uh theyve come in and theyve looked very poised here early in the game and thats what you want on the road try to establish things although a few turnovers in the last couple of possessions So Breed is now 10 of 11 from the free throw line on the season Trying to get back defensively high off the glass and the miss from the driving Taylor since theyve gone to that 34 court pressure with the two guys up front Good things have happened for the Wolfpack Inside luben from Hollowman Hermes was up on the rim to meet him in midair mind you but committed the foul second on Hermes Well you know with the lack of shooting theyve had from the perimeter Im glad to see State going inside attacking the basket Their bigs have done a pretty good job the last couple of possessions Its been quite the journey for Van Allen Luben Vandy Notre Dame North Carolina last year NC State this year 69 from the free throw line this season for Van Allen Lubman playing his 100th career game And heres the progression Thats what uh college basketball thats not uncommon these days To play for Mike Bray at Notre Dame he left Jerry Stackhouse at Vanderbilt he left Didnt really fit into the plan last year When he played significant minutes Mike he can produce on the basketball And thats the thing really that attracted him to Will He knew he was going to get some time here Uh you know at State Hes averaging just under 27 minutes a game And when he gets that type of court time hes been productive He was great in Maui 17 points 10 boards on average in those three games in Hawaii Stepping back right Thats a tough shot And Luben did the defending Breed had it for a moment He chases it down in the corner Yeah they of course theyre locking in on number 55 right now with right Williams Luben tried to grab it and a foul was called Looks like its going to be against the Bulldogs as we step aside for just a moment Twopoint game Stayed in front on and uh of course North Carolina really having a lot of those titles and uh a lot for commissioner Jim Phillips to be excited about with ACC action in finals 22 national titles for the Tar Hills Legendary head coach Anson Dorance Oneonone situation for Luben at the free throw line Well and this has been a a script change really for NC State I talked about the free throw situation in their last few games and they theyve turned that around Next foul theyre going to be shooting in the double bonus for the rest of the half UNC Asheville now scoreless in the last three and a half minutes At one point in this half they had a 147 lead Mike that has quickly dissipated significant shrinkage on that lead Yeah and its uh its been a combination Theyve been defending better out on the perimeter and uh shrinkage is something you want when youre at home and youre in a deficit If youre trying to win for the first time in 20 attempts against the opposing team you got to maintain that lead and they were unable to do so and and really Asheville has not found a way to advance the ball up the floor against NC States pressure Still a fourpoint game Bulldogs hanging in despite the scoring drought The shot clock is at seven inside Solomon twisting shot Oh he was fouled as well Mike Talented move by Solomon inside Yeah 69 I really like him Athletic Uh and this is just a good you know great fundamental basketball right there Bail out on the foul cheering Solomon to complete the threepoint play You know you you like that for uh for Mike Morell You got two of your leading scorers sitting over there on the bench right now and your teams extending its lead and the Solomon points ending a 130 run for NC State How about that Another 10second call cheering It happened again NC State casual getting the ball up the floor that time Here it is right here Gets down to I dont know It was close Yeah it was awfully close It is Bulldog basketball Both teams have a 10second backboard violation in this game See that very often Good defensive pressure by both teams to cause that Inside of 7 minutes to go in our first half deep into the shot clock for the Bulldogs And Solomon the kick the threepointer Cameron Taylor hits the deck cheering back in and uh Mike Moral trusting him with those two fouls And how about Solomon though 69 scored inside the last time making the play that time off the dribble Bring a smile to coach Morels face Solomon with a chance at a fourpoint play We just talked about that lead going away music for UNCC Asheville They built it back up It could be a threepoint lead with the free throw by Taylor Yeah And you got Taylor whos a sophomore and maybe a learning opportunity here how to play with fouls in this situation That three the first points of the afternoon for Taylor at the free throw line cheering Cameron Taylor averages almost 17 points per game for this team Now hes into the box score with the flooroint play Dang looking for three He can hit that shot I dont know if thats the right shot at the right time I dont know if Will Way was real happy with that They broke the press and he settles for a three Deng has made 93 threepointers in his career Not on that occasion Right now NC State and threepointers just one of 10 from the floor Mike thats what Im saying You know if somethings not working for you and theyve had success attacking the rim go inside Taylor from the free throw line leaning in A soft rim bounce here at Lenovo Center And thats a 90 run cheering after a 130 run by NC State Tell you this this team is going to be really good in the Big South I really like what Ive seen so far from them Last year they lost in the semifinals of the Big South tournament to Win High Point the champion in the Big South Shot clock to five Holloway needs to get it away and he does and misses Right over the top for the rebound Cradles it and dribbles it cheering Nice defense def defensive effort by Asheville that time Steal by Dang Twoonone situation Copeland trying to take it all the way to the rim Had it knocked away by Cory Jones and a foul was called And thats Solomon has gotten in trouble a couple of times when hes put and when hes put the ball on the floor heading at the rim with a lot of bodies there A couple of turnovers out front Justin music Wright picked up his second foul in the process here Mike on the drive and Copeland Cuadier Copeland the senior from Philadelphia Pennsylvania 66 and 220 lbs and a 73 free throw shooter Its a well its normally a pretty tight rotation for Mike Morell with his team and really only 78 guys play but hes got four guys right now with two personal fouls So you know in that situation and youre getting the double bonus I mean you really bail a team out by shooting long jump shots Copeland went eight of 12 from the floor 22 points at Auburn midweek Prior to that the three games in Maui for NC State They went one and two on that trip Youre still in the back court Arsenal defending now Holloway Copeland came up to join him and they forced the turnover applause Fifth of the half for Asheville nice job of leading him using that sideline as a defender See that theyve really done a nice job of jumping that quickly as soon as Asheville gets over the half court line Hollowman has the only made three so far for NC State All the way across the court and the miss from Arsenal Sier kept it alive Copelan drew all kinds of defensive attention Ael is ready for three And he really gives himself a chance when he comes into a game He is hunting that threepoint line cheering Timeout Asheville Matt Ael 13th made three of the season for the freshman from Baltimore Maryland Struggled from the floor just two of 11 against Auburn midweek for Ael Just hit that three The fastest growing cable network in all of television is NewsNation NewsNation respects all Americans and is news for all Americans To find NewsNation on your screen go to newswsnation nowcom Alongside the AllAmerican this afternoon Tom Wormy along with our outstanding production crew for CW courtside Saturday Thats where were sitting and watching UNCC Asheville and NC State And were tied at 25 Mike deep into the first half And you know it was it was funny Will Wade talked about how he thought his team was stuck in neutral a little bit And I think since theyve gone to that three quarter pressure theyve gotten it in gear forcing some turnovers and and theyve gotten themselves energized defensively Nine different players have gotten into the box score Put some points on the board for Will Wade just looking for his players to step up the intensity play with more of an edge disrupt the opposition Made a bold statement preseason Mike we are going to the NCAA tournament See if they can fulfill that promise cheering playing in the nonconference That was deflected Sier over to Hollowan Set off Copeland Kicks into the corner Arsenal had it rejected into the second row Thats two block threes that weve seen on on both ends of the floor Great recovery by Mayfield Arsenal for NC State One of those guys with NCAA tournament experience from a year ago He played for Houston and was in the national finals against Florida Played 85 games in his career with the Cougars I like that you know and not only just getting talent but guys who are used to winning Now granted youre youre putting them all together from different programs but still the miss Arsenal tried to get it on the weak side Solomon beat him to the basketball with the elevation Wright leads the way with 10 points for the Bulldogs in the first half Hes back into the game with his two personal fouls Were tied at 25 tried to go inside anticipated by Copelan Odd player break Hollowman three from the wing and he NAILS IT SAME spot he hit the earlier one from and applause I was you know I looked at it He pulled up on the break for laughter the three I was like I dont know about that Eight points now for Trey Hollowman Second made three Came into the game game shooting 53 from Miami Arc able cheering lays it in at the other end An interesting I I thought there was going to be a timeout right there and theyre under four So Mike Morell really he just looked at his team and said All right were going to play through this That is now a 100 NC State run after the able layup Right inside Double Dean has to kick it out Taylor had nowhere to go cheering able to flex it away up ahead Copeland tried to catch it on the run Got tangled up with Cameron Taylor Trey Hollowman His second three from the wing Thats the spot NC State by five Forgotten about that His coaching has been so stellar and hes watching these two teams trade scoring runs in this first half NC State went on a 130 run Ashro responded with a 90 run and NC State on a 100 run Taylor has a chance to put an end to that Well the big thing was when Justin Wright picked up his second personal foul he was on a roll He was carrying them offensively He went out of the game started to get a l loose with the basketball and they werent making shots Yeah Wright has a couple of threepointers to his credit He got to 10 points and double digits relatively early in this first half Has not scored since Mike Well he had 10 points in the first 10 minutes and then right just like a minute after that picked up the second foul Fourpoint game Hollowman Hollowman has two of the three made threepointers in the game for NC State This is Copen Yeah a little two3 zone look by Asheville Copeland almost lost the handle Turn around from Williams First time hes really looked for his shot in the offense So Darien Williams with four points He is the leading scorer this season for NC State Just under 18 per game Able defending right along the midcourt stripe along with Hollowman And another backcourt 10second violation And Reight cant believe it Neither can Mike Morell Thats the third one in the game Mike You know at some point youve got to make some sort of adjustment against this Theyre just putting a lot of pressure on right to break it with the dribble Williams a senior from Sacramento California tried to thread the needle there to Sier Couldnt finish it off Hes laughing to himself on the way back down the court Now thats as easy a basket as youre going to get Fresh hand from the Gambia attempt Taylor straight away for three and hes ripping the ropes for the Bulldogs and hes into double digits with 10 points and he had a nice clean look at that three too Nice movement ball movement everything on the weak side Copeland had it knocked away Sier going to the court trying to find it Solomon up ahead Taylor Hollowman with a quick close on right Thats what you got to do He hit those early threepointers on the other side of the court cheering 120 to go in our first half of play Shot clock is inside of 10 for UNC Asheville Its down to four Wright needs to get it away from the baseline and connects And there was some contact underneath the basket It was able for NC State and for UNC Asheville was DJ Patrick Theyre going to count the basket And then there was the foul on the blockout So it wasnt on the shooter So Mayfield is going to the free throw line one and one situation after Wright connected on the baseline So Wright leads the way with 12 Taylors got 10 Hollerman and his eight points lead the way for Will Wades team Mayfield at the free throw line And its interesting leaving his guys out there with two with the two personal fouls with a minute to go in the half Taking a little bit of a gamble A onepoint lead for NC State Perhaps a bit of a surprise to most in the crowd And there was a miscommunication as the ball came right to our broadcast position out of bounds and back to UNC Asheville trailing by one Hallelu gave it up at the wing and then was making a basket cut and uh you know it looked like Abel was expecting somebody to be there for the pass from the corner Taylor long rebound McNeel got a piece of it Now Ables got five points in the first half applause Ables off of that NC State bench Holman to McNeel straight away Turn and fire First points of the game for Paul McNeel Jr and his 21st three of the season He leads the team in that category He had started every game prior to this afternoon Nice live Lets see if they can get a stop here and have some momentum going into halftime McNeel the only returning scholarship player for NC State Asheville basketball 108 seconds to go in the first half So McNeel goes out Arsenal comes back in for NC State Williams is going to leave as well Four points Darion Williams in the first half Solomon tried to drop it low That was Mayfield who couldnt handle the pass and went off of the pack So well stay at music this end of the floor Mike with 6 seconds to go in the first half Plenty of time You dont have to rush through the play right here Remember they had a turnover underneath out of bounds earlier Bulldogs led by as many as nine here in the first half That was Solomon going high for the alley Scoop off the inbounds from Taylor and a foul called They put Sonia in the game to get some size inside and just he let Solomon get behind him He had to come over from the weak side to try to help that time Six of 10 from the stripe of the first half for UNCC Asheville Solomon at the line just inside 6 seconds to go in our first half All things considered Tom with the foul trouble that Asheville has had there and Mike Morel has got to be very happy with where his team is right now Theyre also coming off a win Tuesday Mike against UNCC Greensboro That was at Paris Cherokee Center in Asheville 8277 in the victory their fourth of the season City still trying to get very much back on its feet after Hurricane Helen Yeah they had training camp in Charlotte North Carolina in October last year just to get ready for the season The the school wasnt affected that much but you know your daytoday life certainly is Final seconds Hollow trying to get it away Lost the handle That ends the half Mike Jaminsky we got a line of like Syracuse with an upset win against a ranked Tennessee team and they stormed the court at the dome A lot of orange in that game Lot of good things happening Duke beat Florida in the challenge Ready for the second half We crank up the second 20 minutes from Raleigh Luben doublefisted Yeah NC State really played out of the double team well that time Composure and theyre theyve come right back to that pressure More aggressive McNeel almost had the steal Now Solomon couldnt handle it Another 10sec count Third of the game Amazing I mean that was some suffocating pressure by NC State but that thats the difference First half it it wasnt token but it wasnt that aggressive Um we saw the double team now Luben who just had that jam Hes got six points in the game Mcneel wasting no time from the corner Misses on the run Taylor got tied up Williams tied him up and picked up a foul The other big thing that Nashville has to do keep those guys from not picking up that third foul here early And a good aggressive take Thats how you get the call Taylor at the free throw line cheering for the Bulldogs Cameron Taylor sophomore from Charlotte North Carolina and all freshman selection last year in the Big South Mike Morell he and coach Will Wade cheering both assistants at Virginia Commonwealth from 2011 to 2013 They both were assistants at Clemson as well And they had a very warm greeting and talk before the game when they were both introduced And uh great to see that Will Wade head coach at MCN the last two years five years at LSU took that program to the NCAA tournament three times and twice to the tournament as the head coach at VCU for Wade Escape dribble and the miss And in mixing up the defenses UNCC Asheville has done a nice job NC State caught a little offguard that time against the zone Taylor around the edge right to Williams Tied him up Ball stays with the Bulldogs This time Williams got all ball on a driving Taylor Just really good anticipation that time by Williams picking up the driver Shot clock inside of 10 for Astro making the trip from 250 mi west of Raleigh Deep into that clock Solomon front rim And now McNeel I mean he had a short cover on him but that was to the advantage of Hollowman You know him playing a big out front like that with the dribble Hes got the advantage Luben operating in the paint with the kick out and McNeel stepping it into a three Luben over top keeps it alive cheering Unselfish pass by Hollowman Got it right back Copeland And that was really unselfish offense all the way around And it starts with Luben with the recycle of the play Seven points now for Cuadier Copeland who averages just under 15 per game second best cheering on the NC State roster Hes hes been at his best when they played their best competition lately 28 points against Texas 22 against Auburn on the road for Copeland on Wednesday in a losing effort Shot clock down to three Deep into that clock again for right Needs to recognize and shoot McNeel came away with it Luben wanted that basketball Mike flashing in the paint Yeah they theyve why they have four guys playing around one basically Luben going between high post and low post Copler passing tight quarters Luben was ready and completes the play Not an easy pass not an easy catch inside but a terrific play 7 to1 run for NC State Its got its largest lead of the game An eightpoint advantage 4234 States gotten a lot off of that using uh Luben in the pick and roll letting him get to the rim They say they might have got some inspiring words from coach Will Wade at halftime cheering Theyve been locked in defensively spirited practice yesterday Looking for results today McNeel everything but the bucket Right trying to go oneonree as McNeel joins the Frey Solomon front rim Luben They still dont have a field goal in this half 04 now Eight rebounds for Luben inside What a pass Copeland to Luben as they collaborate for the pack Thats 10 points now for Luben Big time factor early in the second half I thought Coach Burell was thinking about a timeout He decides to play on Yeah And uh and again they just got the ball advanced it over half court before the 10sec count cheering screaming It might have been McNeel on a reach in picks up the foul NC State with a 10point lead What a pass Luben the finish from headtohead Manny Diaz has done a fabulous job at Duke Tony Elliott head coach of the year in the ACC Yep Trying to win the Cavaliers first title since 95 Duke all the way back to 1989 They were co champs with Virginia and Steve Spurer was the head coach of the Blue Devils Thatll fall another corner Patrick Well and boy much needed basket You like to see that execution coming out of a timeout with a score Well it was a 91 run to start the second half prior to that three Copeland came up a little bit short That was always an awkward step And now hes Yeah he came down a little funny And then you know boy he he looks like he tra he doesnt and he looks like he travels when hes going to the basket but he did come down a little awkwardly Again NC State this season Five and three Theyve had the halftime lead in all five of those victories And they are putting a lot of pressure on Justin Wright to handle this press and get the ball over half court He is their leading scoreer with 12 points buying five of 10 from the floor and a couple of threepointers for rights Well we talked about it Tom Only 10 He had 10 points at the 10minute mark in that first half So theyve locked in on him He had 18 points in that win against UNCG this week for UNCC Asheville Ael picks up the foul his second Hermes with the basketball Solomon will see if he can pick it up in the second

Asheville I mean thats thats their mo They really lean on their starters for their scoring Theyre going to play a majority of the minutes as this season unfolds Holman has eight Ael has eight off the

This is Williams the leading scorer during the season for the Pack and he now has six with that jumper As I said he has not looked for his offense And here again they they were leaving it to Bright to
