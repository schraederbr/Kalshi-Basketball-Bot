alltime winning as coach in conference history you and I talked with Coach ham earlier today he made it clear to us that his coaching span clears close to 50 years hes been doing this along the sidelines but yet hasnt seemed much like what his team has been going through to start this season Ed to jump it up against nahem McLoud and Purdue controls and this will be Braden Smith The Freshman to handle and take a peek at the starting lineups for Purdue Gillis lawyer Smith Edy and Morton whos their glue guy and this is Morton Music Applause handling important for Florida State to get off to a good start especially on the defensive end of the floor lawyer buries that one we talked with Matt painer earlier and asked him the difficult question as to who is your best shooter and it took him a while to come up with someone but I do believe he said lawyer was shot try for the lob there couldnt connect with flexer and Purdue back the other way and good hands right there by Mills and he puts it in and thats Florida State basketball turning defense and offense Caleb Mills with great hands to come up with the steal in the easy bucket and for Florida States leading score a good way to get started and one of the things to keep an eye on for Florida State they like to play high intensity normally like to play a lot of guys coach Hamilton a limited right now in that regard the Miss by lawyer Here Comes Florida Applause Music State and now the boiler makers back the other way just getting going here in Music Tallahassee needy with a kick Music out and thats out of bounds itll be Florida State basketball and Florida State fortunate lawyer has missed backto back wide open threes and we talked about his shooting prowers so Florida State fortunate but that those are not shots they want to continue to give up and allow lawyer to have because hes not going to miss open yeah 39 and even Matt painer said that maybe doesnt really tell the story of how good a shooter he is agreed he normally doesnt get looks like this these open ones hes normally shooting contestant because hes at the top of the Scouting Report when it comes to Perimeter players for the bullet maker for short Morton rebounds and Purdue on the Applause move and Morton threw it away as the take away with green and green stepped on the Baseline out of bounds its a turnover and itll go the other way uncharacteristic turnover by Morton but for Florida state is kind of par for the course thats what theyve done more than anyone for any of Florida State teams as of late on the season Florida state with 105 assists to 115 turnovers difficult to win basketball games like that just over 2 minutes in I think the other thing we anticipate with Purdue having the basketball would be to isolate 80 down on that low block and thats what Florida States going to do theyre going to try to make it difficult on the perimeter for the guys to handle the basketball and theyve done a great job with that early continuing to turn over Purdue which is a team that normally handles the basketball very well lecher with a nice step in to knock it away and the seals an opportunity to take the lead Florida stay off to just a one and seven start and that jumper will go for green in the ns lead and you see once again Florida State when they score theyre going to go to the 94 ft of pressure and force Purdue guards to have to handle that pressure to try to limit the opportunities for Ed to touch the Applause basketball Ed sets the screen High lawyer from the free throw line and hes Music fouled and I believe they got Matthew Cleveland and one of the things we talked M with Matt painer about earlier today with Florida States pressure and often times with switching on ball screens Etc they force you to have to make individual plays and thats going to be the goal of the seol in this game instead of giving Purdue opportunities to just sit back and no pressure on the basketball throw it inside to Edy theyre going to try to heat up the guards to see if they can get them out of their comfort Applause zone lawyer one out of two Ed had his hands on it seol the other way fetcher the Kentucky transfer he swings it Music Applause and Green books one from De and green can do that hes the one guy thats had some success shooting the basketball for the seol this year two good looks for him already that one for three thats his 20th G of the year it leads the team he was shooting 40 from behind the threepoint line coming in Gillis wide open and that was halfway down it rolls out seminal by three and the Applause Music ball Gillis tracks down the Miss Here Comes Purdue Smith wide open well theyve had some open looks at it just havt able to hit him yeah and youre talking about great Shooters getting those open looks as well oh bid soft touch there for Matthew Cleveland but one of the things you see from Florida State and this is Florida State basketball they have four guys if they rebound the basketball they can push it often times putting your defense in compromising situations but Matthew Cleveland looking to the bench asking for a sub and this is where it gets interesting for Leonard Applause Hamilton GIS able to hit as he answ not sure what defensive assignment that was however I know none of it was to allow GIS to have a wide open three on the other side seminal in a rough stretch right now after a one and seven start and backto back games playing Purdue and Virginia green catch and shoot and that missed everything and time out on the court the seals off to a good start Florida State a twopoint advantage and they got some good deep shooting Darren Green knocking it down from Beyond the threepoint line and speaking of Threes thats really all Purdue has done so far is trying to shoot the three yeah Purdue unable to get the basketball inside to Zach Edy early in this game give Florida State a lot of credit for the pressure theyre putting on the perimeter players making it difficult to feed the Music Post David Jenkins Jr is checked in thats him with the basketball as well as Caleb first also Trey Coffman Ren for Purdue and this is the formula for Florida State basketball the question becomes how long can they sustain this without the numbers they nor play with do they have enough guys to be able to apply this type of pressure for 40 minutes yeah and early on in this season the answer to that question is no they have not been able to play the way they want to play they just dont have enough guys nice block that one rejected by green out of bounds four in the shot clock for new basketball and thats one of the areas of qu state theyre going to switch defensively and you see green just picking up helping out a teammate who was beaten off the dribble and coming up with the emphatic Music block Horton inbounds and gapy said steep on the sideline a turnover out of bounds Florida State ball yeah and the fourth turnover already on Purdue which is uncharacteristic of their guards they havent seen this type of pressure yet this season and we have to mention Purdue plays with a young back Applause court Theres Tom house handling and now a feed down low the NOS moving the basketball and that one Purdue eventually as it was saved in goes back the other way so 14 to go here first half and Florida State leading it by coup and a bucket inside Kaufman Ren in the first twopoint field goal attempt for the boiler makers in the game with over six minutes having been Applause played and stepping on the Baseline was Trey Coffman Ren so out of bounds the double came and It produced the steal but Kaufman Ren on the other end of the floor patient the pump fake able to finish over the top and thats what the way Purdue wants to be able to play they want to go inside out give Florida State Credit for making that difficult for them early in this game you saw a lot of Purdue out in Portland if you were to sort of boil it down and give us sort of the bullet points on what makes Matt painters team so good what would you say well Zach lets start with the big fell in the middle whos one of the best players nationally not just in the Big 10 but one of the best players in the country and the attention that he draws opens up so many opportunities for his teammates on the outside and normally guys who are really good Shooters theyre shooting 459 from the field and 34 from three overall so thats a pretty good shooting team and especially when youve got a big fell like that in the middle that you can play around got that last foul on Trey Kaufman Ren Caleb Mills here the transfer from Houston leading the goals in scoring for the the second straight year warley kick out Mills will try and a fight for the loose ball off of first and it ends up with Jenkins Applause Music Applause first little jump p and they got Caleb first for going over the back to foul on the Lefty but for those who think that Purdue is just about Zach Ed they would be mistaken kayb first can get the job done on the Block as well he would be a starter pretty much anywhere else he just happens to be playing behind Zach EDI but Caleb first a double double against Duke 11 points 10 rebounds is a big time performer as well Leonard Hamilton talked to us about how hes hurt them in the past and hes got multiple skill sets right you could actually play him with Ed if you want to absolutely he can shoot the basketball from Beyond the threepoint Arc can handle it pass it was a very high recruit coming to for tandler Jackson is checked in this is Jackson missed the first few games of a broken thumb see has that right thumb taped up gets into the paint flips it up little strong Newman the Applause Music Applause rebound hins lost the handle and here come the semor beat inside and that one just short as Deontay green couldnt convert and thats been a struggle for the semal this year of course theyre going to continue to turn you over but if you dont take advantage of those turnovers on the other end of the floor your offense can struggle at times and thats where the issue has been for the noes a 99 game here in the early going and its our Under 12 timeout back here in Tallahasse V week continues whoa Is that real speed the flossing okay I believe it is but you normally dont see someone of that age doing it no its a good point well the defense been living here so far 99 here at the Tucker Center John Choy Cory Alexander 11 59 to go here first half now Matt Painter team had some trouble adjusting and he admitted as much he said it usually against Florida State takes us close to a half to kind of get assimilated to what theyre doing I mean its its intense the way they come after you it really is and its simply about the 94 ft of pressure and Leonard Hamilton told us hes watched film on them he was surprised to see so many teams just allowing Purdue to sit there with no pressure on the ball throwing the ball inside to Zach e you have dont have a chance of guarding him that Music way they get it into Ed this time looking for an outlet and he gets it to cofman Ren back to Ed and thatll go asent point yeah if he catches the basketball and you play behind him you are at his Mercy part of the reason why he shoots close to 70 from the field yeah its just kind of mad right I mean hes 74 hard to contest that loose ball inside and a foul good work by Chandler Jackson and the underneath out of bounds play out of the timeout Matt Painter wanted to make sure he gets Zack Ed a touch his first field goal attempt of the day and again its so difficult to defend that great touch at 7 4 he dwarfs normal big man when you consider the guys in the competition hes playing Applause again Jackson gets the Applause first line1 flexer back in Music Applause Ed up and every Florida State score gives him an opportunity to set up their pressure to see if they can heat up the Purdue guards in the back court Applause ran wadell end the game thats him right there Bou on the floor dad Matt was a thousand Point score and Matt painters teammate had Purdue we were talking about Matt Painter in his playing days at Purdue and his senior year 9293 they started out 6 and 0 only got better when he left though the next year they started out 14 and0 be inside and caufman ren absorbs a contact and hes Music fou mat painter a guy known for being able to coach offense very well and hes one of those dudes that he likes some of the an Antics they also do stuff where they give potential recruits personality tests to try and figure out whos going to fit in their system and for the most part theyve done a pretty good job of getting guys that that fit with their culture Ed rebound rolls at home and the soft touch and the one thing Zach Ed averages five offensive rebounds a game thats the astronomical number when you think about it five offensive boards a game out of his 12 rebounds and he has the ability just to shoot over top of everyone but the soft touch that hes displayed twice on the jump Music off that one a little strong Smith tracks it down thats Newman and that missed all of Applause Music it out of bounds and itll go the other way and right in front of Matt per and boo you talked about Matt P known for being such a great offensive coach but how about this Purdue team they have yet to allow an opponent to shoot over 42 from the field and you go back and look at the teams that theyve already played Marquette Duke Gonzaga West Virginia West Virginia I believe was the only team that shot over 40 against them this Music season Rue by a couple Music and warley picking up BR Applause Smith Edy had really good position he sealed off McLoud in that spot and then Edy had it Stripped Away theres a rule with bigs but if you can see their numbers on the front of their Jersey they should get the basketball when Zach Es case you dont have to see the whole one five you if you see one of the numbers throw it Smith couldnt hit tip Ed tips again and the little point guard comes away with it and then what L gets Music Music rejected and that one banked home home from straight on from Cleveland because its been a struggle I wont say take it off but outside of that you got to take that one off you got to call it that or something Bo you cant just shoot it from the line and go glass but its been an offensive struggle this year for the for the no so well allow Applause it e he throws it down plus one and more importantly the emotion after he finishes now think about it on the last possession inside the arena you can hear the commentary after the block shot Zack Edy making sure that there will be no conversation after this one and if there is any its going to come from the guys in Black I love it Zach Ed with a little something to say after the Finish 21 points seven points per game and then a dozen rebounds per game and five Doubles Doubles all anyone you can think of thats absolutely the free throw ability to shoot free throws anyone you can think of right now ahead of Zach me in the National play of the year I dont think so I I think hes got to be the front runner right now right now look at that lecher with Ed closing on him knocks it down its a big three and retired a big bucket by Cameron Fletcher knocking down to three but the fact that Zach edia 74 Sprints out to try to contest that shot says a lot about the way Matt payer coaches this team Applause up Morton was trying to find the point guard bra Smith Florida State deflects it out of bounds and with 12 of the shot clock its Purdue basketball tied at 16 Leonard Hamiltons got to be happy with at least the first 11 plus minutes from his team I believe so you havent had a lot of action from Zach Edy hes been successful when hes been able to get his hands on the basketball but before the stat in a great job getting in the passing Lanes the deflections the Steals and of course the turnover s got seven in on McLoud and a little strong loose ball goes to the Nos and its chance to take the Music lead and that jump wouldnt fall Cleveland puts it in and one thats the effort from Matthew Cleveland Lard hamood has been looking for last years ACC six man of the year making plays without having to have the basketball in his hands the offensive rebound the put back and the lead for the noes so Cleveland at the line and a chance to complete the threepoint play this kid was a big time recruit number 30 in the ESPN 100 I mean talk about a top 30 recruit youre expecting big impact and hes made it as you mentioned six Man of the Year its something Florida State for whatever reason has done well I guess cuz they they Foster that depth and playing a lot of guys over the last five or six years its been the seol of the Year War man the year in ACC 80 inside two more hes got Music nine and we got a flop one well no sorry no longer a warning it is a flop which will be a Class B technical foul one free throw for Florida State and Smith talking to Jeffrey Anderson letting him know there was contact on that he tried to get the call in the back Court green will have the one free throw I like that theyre getting this out of the game personally just I think that it it it started to become a thing where guys Shooters are shooting and being almost taught to to fall after they shoot and then guys are you know getting into kind of flopping over on the defensive side I I agree heartly Im glad that this is in the and again I like the fact that its only one free throw it does not count as a personal foul on the person that gets it but it does make you cognizant of making sure that you dont do it again because you are giving away potential Music points left side warle Gillis just out efforting the seminal and then back the other way and itll be Florida State basketball Zach Edy showing some Music Applause emotion hasnt had a lot of opportunities but when he gets them hes taking advantage of them the big fella finishing on the interior let his emotions show but Matthew Cleveland ahead to the big match ups in the AC Big 10 challenge tonight all right you guys look forward to it under eight to go here first half and Florida State with a twopoint Advantage yeah still to come UNC and Indiana Michigan State Notre Dame and later on BC and Nebraska that was a tough loss for Florida State losing to a Nebraska team pick to finish last in the Big 10 and that was in Orlando yeah surprising and again when you think about Florida State and what theyve been able to do over the past last decade with Leonard Hamilton been a surprising start to this season to say the least Y inside absorbs the contact BT Smith coming over itll be on Deontay green Edy to the stripe Zach Edy made a huge jump last year from freshman to sophomore year making an even bigger jump this year he is big S 4 290 76 from the line so far this year and in his career almost 70 thats pretty darn good I mean most big guys for whatever reason whether its the hands or whatever arent usually great at the line 70 is that a play that is a luxury simply because for a guy that youre going to feature on the offensive in the floor whos going to see it so much you cant afford just to go foul him hes going to draw enough just on his action alone and when you put him at the free throw free throw line if hes making 76 of his free throws that those are great opportunities for Purdue so and again hes going to always draw fouls simply because hes such a factor in the offensive Music end little pull up there Edy tipping it and Edy pulls it down and Jackson couldnt get it to Applause fall D shooting just 35 from the floor so the Florida State Defense has been good and I think they just got McLoud for the foul is Ed hit the deck Im not sure if McLoud was trying to convince the officials that that was going to be a hook and hole but you see as they lock arms as McLoud actually hooking Edy just not a smart play for McLoud I mean at that point youre the one who got the your arms Tangled all you have to do is put your hand straight up youre talking two seven Footers and thats giving away a foul thats going to be necessary for you to stay on the floor 8 short and a rebound for Florida State Camp Fletcher just th six and a half to go first half how about the beginning of the season for Purdue coming off back to back wins over Gonzaga and theyre six and0 and whats often lost in that conversation is they also beat a very good West Virginia team to start it out West Virginia actually played him closer than gonzago nor oh Ed the follow of the Smith misss as he throws it down and Zack edting continues to make an impact hes got 13 and hes already got three offensive rebounds we talked about he averages five offensive boards a game third 30 already in six games this season and thats often the case he turns them into a bucket when he gets his hands on the basketball 30 second time out back after this Purdue by two John chambi Cory Alexander the offensive glass I mean look you isolate him on the Block yeah but he he can go get misses as you were touching on and we weve seen it here tonight but often times if you front Zack 80 means when a shot goes up he now has inside position so hes going to be able to get to the glass and at 7 4 he doesnt have to go very far to be able to tip dunk that back I feel like at times weve seen Florida state theyre trying to front him and then sneak a guy from behind if he successfully catches the pass and maybe try and knock it away but he does a great job of keeping the basketball high so even when you send that help Defender often it doesnt matter cuz its 74 and he keeps the basketball high enough the second Defender wont be able to Applause affect do by Applause Music two Cleveland jumper got it and re tired and nice play by Matthew Cleveland there getting to his spot and being patient to make sure no help Defenders around going to the turnaround jump this ones been tight the whole way biggest lead of the game Florida State by five and more importantly Florida State hasnt had to play a fast enough Pace to really tire out their guys so this is something that may be sustainable for the NOS moving into the second Music half green will try and hit thats a confident shot right there green raising up and we you know the logo here at the down L Taco Center is rather large but still logo R logos the Applause logo one point game now as zinal come back the other way Music Applause Music nice that one ended up right in the hands of our statman sha now the fifth turnover for the simol and for Florida State when you dont shoot it as well when youre not offensively a strong team you can afford to turn the basketball over and not get those opportunities but fortunately on that possession there dead ball turnover which allows them to set their defense Applause Jin being harassed gives it off to first four minutes to go first half beat in Ed looking opposite and then theres that jump hook I mean youre just not stopping that youre not stopping it and you know Florida state is sending the double team but theyre leaving and when you leave Zach Edy is smart enough to be able to see that he knows hes got oneonone coverage leer little short Jenkins gobbles it up Music Applause tried for a a back cut there they isolate eting good look first ball fak and McLoud the block they ran it well but McLoud recovered nicely yeah McLoud did a great job coming to help out a teammate who was in no mans land and its fortunate that that wasnt a goal sending call if you would see that a little earlier someone was hanging back here in jassi John chambi Cory Alexander and number five Purdue leading it by a point uh what do you got on this watch Darren Green well I think its a great way for Darren Green not to pick up the foul grabbing the net so his body doesnt take him into Caleb first a beautiful find from Zack Ed but give nahim mlau a lot of credit for coming over and being able to come up with that block shot getting Florida State the basketball back and not a goal 10 because the ball was not in the air because the ball had not been released if Caleb first shoots that basketball with green hanging on to the net that is the automatic goal end for affecting the rim during the shot 2625 Purdue Florida State looking to Applause Music inbound that shot skimming the front edge of the rim and then Newman gets fou Music team foul number eight so theyll March it down to the other end and Purdue normally shoots right from the free throw line not great so far in this game only four for eight from the charity strike Applause gets the first coming up next over on ESPN in the ESPN app at 915 Eastern its the 24th annual ACC Big 10 Challenge and it rolls on number 18 North Carolina taking on number 10 Indiana at Assembly Hall in Bloomington its another Sonic Music Blockbuster and another split at the free throw line for the B makers coming into the game shooting Clos to 79 from the free throw line and only 50 thats far here tonight off the glass and good as green comes up with the bucket hes got 11 yeah Green showing that hes more than just a threepoint shooter putting the ball on the deck getting to the rim and the nice finish off the glass so hes right about at his season average here tonight as we close in on two and a half to Applause Music go and they go possession arrow it belongs to Florida Music State Darren Green Jr going to be guarded heavily at the threepoint line because hes had success this time getting his shoulders past the defender going off the glass thats TI the game for the no 27 a piece Applause Music Music Applause Music early little shaking Bank Shot the short the rebound newal try and hit confident shot from Newman right in front of the Florida State bench has something to say to the bench and I believe is teed up after he knocks down the three Newman knocks down to three immediately looks back has something to say to the Florida state bench right in front of official Jeffrey Anderson and again if youre going to say something you got to know where the officials are I mean to me the funny part of the entire exchange was Jeffrey Anderson makes the call looks at Matt painer you know kind of like is there something youd like to say to me and Matt painer looked him right in the eye and went no youre right thumbs up Matt payter understands it he a player he he was a player he was a competitor and he also knows that hey you got to know have better quar awareness no if youre going to say something to the bench make sure the officials arent right beside you to hear it Applause Music Applause Jackson over Newman loose ball Jackson gets it back another loose ball tipped in the air and eventually it looked like Hoffman Ren had it for a second and he ended up absorbing the contact that hes fouled but each and every one of these fouls against the simol ends up as they trip to the free throw line on for the bowler makers and both teams doing a great job getting after the basketball trying to come up with the 5050 Ball but it ends up being an opportunity for the bowler makers at the line Leonard Hamilton and his top assist Stan Jones having a chat there with Chandler Jackson cofin Ren knocks it down caufman ran another one of those role players for the bowler makers kue has nine players averaging over four points per game and 10 players who average over 10 minutes per game so we talk about death were used to seeing that with Florida State but Matt payner definitely hasnt for sure and done such a good job recruiting Indiana and cof and ran a guy that falls into that category Hamilton was envious of Matt payter recruiting of Indiana he looks like he pretty much has the run of the state right now Applause green probing and they get the travel cam Music Corin coren just in a bit of a rush on that possession getting an Music opportunity 610 Pro rash will sit down and McLoud will check back in yeah just started to dance a little early before the music started playing I get it freshman playing in a big game against one of the best players in the Music country Smith picked up his dribble F Music Ed Morton a pretty open look that hasnt been Mortons strength all the season hes done everything great but except for shooting green gets another speaking of strength that is definitely his strength there Ken knocks down his third threepointer here on the evening hes got 16 and the foul on Jackson is Morton hit the floor and this is Florida State basketball Jaylen Wy getting out in transition Darren Green finding the corner knocking down the three ball to the game at 32 Aaron green Jr to transfer from Central Florida UCF he led the knights at scoring last year a little over 13 a game El from North Carolina so heres Ethan Morton at the line Morton junor from Butler Pennsylvania I got to give a shout out to his high school basketball coach Mt Clement major league pitcher Matt Clement had a really nice long career and was a very good pitcher but hes a poops junkie and that was Ethan Mortons coach in high school I like it we had another famous baseball Hoops junkie in the building earlier today huh David Ross the manager of the Cubs connecting with Matt Painter who is a huge Cubs fan David Rossy lives here in fahass twopoint game its been a good one here in the first half and theres Edie getting into it defensively first collects the tip and Purdue will hold for the last shot leading by two ah will they mistake there they were supposed to Im not sure the Freshman knew the clock Matt Painter not happy with that hes having the conversation yeah Matt painer just looked at Bren Smith and just said come on man you got to know and again its a its a freshman mistake Braden Smith of course hailing from the state of Indiana played high school basketball at a very high level not sure if they had a shot clock and not sure if he was in that situation before he always had the green line ler and and well go to the break Purdue on top at the half the number five team of the country on the road and leading in but just by two lets send it back to the studio Music now e fres refres just a game Florida State turn him over eight times in that first half you know Matt Painter would like to see that change in the second half and what lonard Hamilton would like to see change is more points off those turnovers only four points off of those eight turnovers for Music S Edie inside off the glass and good he has 17 but one of the things you see with Edy he recognizes he looks first to see wheres the double team coming from is it coming if youre going to play me oneonone Im going to attack you but he also knows how to find the right guy Cleveland and one and Matthew Cleveland will go to the line and a chance to finish off a threepoint play thats the second answer to a Zack Ed bucket that Matthew Cleveland has had in this game and the second time as well respectively that its an opportunity for and one a threepoint play for GL Matt painer talked to us earlier about the fact that they tried to get involved in recruiting Matthew Cleveland both of his parents Engineers from Georgia Tech he was selling the engineering program from Purdue said they couldnt get far them SM pushes into the front Court Purdue by a point hes getting started here second half its been a rough beginning of the year for Florida State but here tonight theyve acquitted themselves quite nicely against one of the top teams in the country to the corner Gillis ball fake gets inside gets a piece of the paint and not able to hit Florida State the other way a chance to take the lead green off one foot and booked that one 18 for Darren Green Jr and green does a great job recognizing Edan drop coverage and as he gets ah head of steam going at Ed has to backpedal so he can get that shot off not giving him a chance to gather his balance and block the shot its a hard shot it is but its not a runner thank you for not saying thaton off the mark and green with another he is red hot tonight hes got 21 and playing with confidence and forgive me its not even floating thank you for not saying floting it was a Applause runner that one opposite and count that for flexure lawyer just like to start the game lawyer was able to knock down a three to start scoring for Purdue does the same here to begin the second half someone going to have to find a way to cool off Darren Green Jr for the bowet maker leer jumper and that rolls off Gillis the rebound green and Cleveland theyve got 33 of Florida State 40 Applause Music points Warrior will try hits another doesnt get easier than that for La he still had the basketball before Florida States Defenders left him on that possession giving him an easy look to regain the lead for the ball makers Cory Caleb Mills been quiet in this game and Caleb Mills has had stretches where he struggled offensively for Florida State as cam Fletcher comes up with the offensive rebound the foot back but Mills has to regardless of the offense continue to defend lawyer wide open and E couldnt secure it Florida State basketball with the lead Applause and now Smith but they dont have numbers he Applause Music waits right now You got to be thinking Im going to take the big fell off the dribble and one oh boy bra Smith putting it on the deck ended up on the floor but he put it home off the glass and itll go to the line but as a guard when you have the basketball that far away from the basket and youve got a sevenfooter stepping out to guard youve got to be thinking aggressively Im going to put this ball on the floor Im going to the basket now there may be help I might have to drop it off but Ive got to at least put that level of pressure on the opposing teams defense for disrespecting me by putting a sevenfooter on me its like having a mouse in the house inverted its the right its the reverse of the mouse in the house yes Music Applause Music Smith rattles it home Purdue with a 4442 Advantage Hills hesitated 80 rips down the rebound Applause Music Applause Smith will try need got a hand on the rebound but Sims the other way chance to tie it or take the lead with a three Fletcher and McLoud puts it in a great job by cam Fletcher sealing and just getting the shot up on the glass even though he didnt make it by Ed coming over to help gives his teammate an opportunity for the fo back nice rejection there by Applause McLoud tied at 44 151 to go seminal is looking to pull off an upset Purdue with a thir third biggest climb in a single week in the AP rankings from 24 all the way to five and how about that note Leonard Hamilton has the most top 25 wins while his team has been unranked in NCA history 55 of them this would fall into that category so try it for number 56 here tonight coach ham takes a lot of pride in that and he takes a lot of Pride also in taking jobs that other people didnt want when when he took over at Oklahoma State when he took over at Miami and then when he took over at Florida State this was not a very good basketball program but has built it into a Powerhouse not only within the ACC but a team that you can rely on to make a run in marks a down year this year but this has become one of the Premier programs in the country be inside Caleb first able to Corral it theyre playing first and Ed together Smith kicked to the corner thats first and Smith able to scramble for the rebound needs some help gets it off and Applause Mort good look first inside and puts it in you see the versatility of Caleb first on that possession shooting to three and then getting inside finishing and thats part of the reason why you can play these two together and theres Tom house with a much needed three and all of a sudden Florida stay back in front by a point but one of the things that Leonard Hamilton does by getting his guys in the first half and giving them some action they get confidence and you see house is a much more confident player with that shot here in the second half that we saw in the first half has got a Little More Bounce to a step especially after he sees one go down that last foul on Camp horen Music Deonte green theyll check in for Camp Fletcher Deonte green more than likely if Florida state had a healthy group wouldnt have played this season just returning after a knee injury in j January but thats too easy right there yeah you know no need to even talk about that that was like that was like on that felt like on a Nerf hoop back in the day youre in your bedroom Nerf hoop you know there are people out there listening that dont no idea what no idea what Nerf hoop is which is sad it is its terrible Nerf hoop was probably the most inexpensive entertainment oh gosh magnificent Applause Music Applause Music good ball movement first inside that wouldnt fall and out of bounds Florida State basketball Purdue by a point take a look at the Edy dun one of the reasons why Zach Edy is so efficient is because hes playing on a Nerf hoop at 74 hey hey you know whats the the best part about it hes a good athlete and the thing is its not like hes slow and he cant jump things like that hes a relatively good athlete especially for a guy thats 7 fo4 hes leaving the ground when he dunks the basketball which makes it even more difficult its not as though hes just tiptoe dunking he did start playing basketball until he was 15 kid from Canada baseball was really the sport he was a pitcher and a first baseman can you imagine standing at home plate well its got to feel like hes delivering the ball from about 3 ft away exactly Randy Johnson at a different Applause Music level Ed right now directing the offense from the paint didnt get the opportunity in the post that he wanted SM that the basket puts it in Applause marle flips that up first rebounds Here Comes Smith for new by three looking to extend the Music Applause lead good pass first with a throw down off the feed from bra Smith that was a beautiful f by Smith normally I can see him coming that one I had no idea where he was going with the basketball way down to rebound grabbed by Newman another nice find and first rattles it home and just like that its an eightpoint game what weve seen the difference between the level of defensive intensity we saw from Florida State to start the game pressure on the basketball its no longer there here in the second half and Braden Smith is now out here dropping down John chambi Cory Alexander whats changed here in the second half the level of pressure on the basketball in the first half Florida state was heating the basketball up now theres no pressure on the ball which allows Smith to be able to find Caleb first after Darren Green falls asleep on the Baseline to start the game Purdue had five early turnovers to start the second half Purdue has five assists no turnovers here in this second half and part of the reason why they built this lead to eight Leonard Hamilton talked to us about this earlier today the level of intensity the level that they can put out in the first half because they dont have the numbers it dies off in the second half hard its hard for them to be able to execute their plan play the way they want to play with the full 40 is really challenging a nine old Purdue run DB first has been at the center of it hes got seven second half points Cleveland inside and gets that to go and most of the work that Matthew Cleveland has done in this game has been off the dribble attacking the basket maybe he needs to be a little hungrier for his opportunities trying to get downhill Cleveland and a Florida State drought that was a little over 3 Music minutes time the bo 1101 to go time out on the court and well take it with it a number of beautiful passes from brayen Smith with no defense who beged to bark the question whos on first thanks for doing that I appreciate you Caleb first former Mr basketball of the state of Indiana G Alexanders going to need a moment to himself just to drink that one in listen I got my baseball guy in here come on man what better time to use that was perfect whos on first the only thing that would have been better if Terrence man was still here we could drop people will come Ray people will most definitely come there you go or we could have man on first then whos on second yes they get the foul on I think on Fletcher yes C Fletcher pick up his first and Fletcher trying to get in there and get the steal on J and Jenkins had a hard time handling the basketball in the first half so the no will go after him Ed lost the handle what do they call it here well I can I can guarantee Zack Ed did not shoot the basketball up to the shot CL Florida State basketball wow to say Florida State basketball Music trying to cut into the deficit here and green who been quiet for a bit able to draw the foul but I like what green is doing when hes attacking on the pick and roll he continues to make sure he keeps eating on his heels because if Eds on his toes recognizing that hes going to pull up and shoot a jump shot he can gather and go block the shot but as brain continues to go into his Runner he doesnt allow Ed to be able to gather his balance and affect the shot well the fourth annual Big 12 Big East battle tomorrow night we got two games for you the first ones the top seven matchup kraton going up against Texas thatll be a lot of fun and then C PA traveling to Lawrence to take on Kansas Big 12 Big East both games on is and the ESPN and Boo this is the last year of the ACC Big 10 challenge tonight is actually the last night of the ACC Big 10 challenge 24 years of number of great instant classic games great basketball over a large span but we welcome in the era of the ACCC SEC challenge next season Applause Music Applause Newman puts it on the floor and Fletcher charged with his second foul Music Applause Music Applause Smith has made an impact here in the second half getting his teammates more involved goes Baseline Music Here and Now Newman shot clock winding down havent said that a lot Jenkins for and an offensive rebound and a put back Mason killers and thats for du basketball and you mentioned it very few opportunities to run the shot clock all the way down but even when it shot under distress the guys in Black not giving up on the opportunity chasing it down for the offensive board in the put back jumper wouldnt go and a foul inside unproduced after a strong defensive possession the simol unable to come out you see Gill is getting inside position on green as if he were the defender blocking out and the easy offensive board and put back to extend the lead to eight I mean its interesting Id be curious how many shots have been taken its usually something I my eye on with the shot clock under 10 its its been very few it has been very few in this game and you know Purdue is normally a team that again scores in the 70s 80s you know I believe the record for Matt painer is 64 and two when theyve scored over 80 points and again its a team that he talked about his ability to coach offense but this Purdue team defensively is special under n and a half to go produ lead is eight and a nice move there by cam Fletcher yeah nice by cam to avoid the charge getting downhill attacking the basket leard Hamilton was raving about him says hes a warrior will go to battle with Cameron Fletcher any Applause Music day F wanted a travel and a turnover Cleveland inside and Applause one I believe its better that the fans didnt get the call that they wanted cuz if they had it would have been a dead ball turnovers we see Cameron preter avoiding the charge and then after not getting the call Florida State comes up with a turnover getting out in transition Mills to Cleveland Cleveland with the finish the flex and an opportunity for his third and one on the evening Matthew Cleveland with 16 points in this one and rattles that one home the kid from Atlanta having himself a nice night with 17 points and its a threepoint game and Cleveland played his best in the biggest games for Florida State last year so recognizing that this is a big game Cleveland stepping it up Leonard Hamilton got to find a way to get him consistently doing this on a regular basis that painters Purdue boiler makers took the giant leap to number five of the Applause country feed inside Ed and one and he is pumped up the boot youve seen a lot more Zack Edy than I have have you ever seen him this emotional in the game weve seen a number of opportunities where he scored through the contact opportunities for an one but letting out that emotion afterwards really demonstr and showing it off here tonight with 21 points mentioned his career high is 30 I theres just no no question that when he gets it in a certain position hes almost impossible to stop Music Music Applause Music Cleveland collects on the move and that one was off the mark that was the first mistake weve seen Cleveland make one more to Cameron Fletcher who has a wide open look on the Baseline gets him a better opportunity Applause but again a chance for FSU to cut the lead its a fivepoint game and that one rattles home for Mills and now its a threepoint game we talked about Mills being relatively quiet in this game if Florida State can get him going down the stretch to go along with Cleveland and green they can absolutely make this interesting here on their home court Applause offensive foul on Newman so Brandon Newman charged with the foul break in the action and its a threepoint game out the foul trouble against spy 46 from three and then over on ESPN after Ohio State Duke Coach the walking double double Trace Jackson Davis says a Relentless offensive rebounder loves to catch the ball off the right block he gets it there he goes to work boo we look forward to more of our double header coming up after we go final gentlemen and here in Talahassee a good one number five for du getting all they can handle a lot of conversation on the sideline Cameron Fletcher Stan Jones all getting involved in the mix for Florida State and thats really where Florida state has struggled this year its really from a leadership standpoint who is that guy whos that veteran that has been through the fires and can lead these younger players to really what the culture of Florida state has been in my opin I think that Cameron Fletcher is that guy I sent a text message to his high school head coach and Mentor Tony irons earlier today you saw cam I talking about this free game message today not sure if you got it he said I got it sent you a message today not sure if you got it he said I got it loud and clear I felt like you were heckling him well it might have been a little bit of heckling but at the same time its because its because I care I understand its because I care and again this program is a very proud program and tradition and Leonard Hamilton needs that guy to be able to step up I think cam is that guy it not able to hit and theres Fletcher with the rebound and Fletcher with nine rebounds thats one off his career high Mills trying to turn the corner and its poed away Edy secures it TOS the turnover for the NOS an opportunity to possibly tie the game with a three and you walk away with the empty Applause possession here gets inside off the glass and Applause in pretty nice move there from Fletcher lawyer putting it on the deck especially for a guy whos supposed to be just a shooter recognizing the defender running him off the threepoint line getting downhill and getting a bucket when his team needs him a little strong for cam Fletcher and now Smith back the other Applause way and that one off the glass and in theyll bra Smith with the deuce and all of a sudden its a sevenpoint game Music Music its amazing to think you look at this lot on the court for Purdue and you ask the question who has the most rebounds BR Smith has nine leads all the boiler maker yeah all right my bad the little big fella little big fella getting in the mix that 80 slacking only six boards for him tonight so I mean if the seven board guys is not going to go get it I just got the side eyed Y Man Point look my mistake you knew it was coming you used to working with you know those S guards the power forwards spam inside and maybe score that one Applause no Jeffrey Anderson was speaking to the Purdue bench it will be a foul great officiating crew by the way tonight led by of course Bert Smith Jeffrey Anderson my guy John gaffy I mean a a really good group personable group willing to talk to players and as much as I you know talk about my guy ber Smith freegame I love him to death I keep telling him Im going to crush him on air but hes such a good official I have a hard time doing it I want to though no thats my guy great group we out T night I the Jeffrey Anderson did a good job as everybody on the Purdue bench was jumping up and down because McLoud touched it and Jeffrey Anderson very demonstratively said no it was still going up as he pinned it to the Music glass they get a foul on as he was a little too close to Darren Green Green who had a tremendous first half hes been quiet since the break thats the Applause first green providing that scoring for Florida State a necessary goto guy is that sustainable can he be that guy for them this season I mean over the last couple of Seasons we realize that cayb Mills is going to be inconsistent hes going to have his games where he goes for 20 plus hes going to have his games where he struggles to get the double figures if Florida State can add another score consistent score that would help oh nice great look and Smith finds Ed it doesnt get any easier than that right you can see bra Smith is comfortable amongst the Music trees and that one drops in Applause kills and now some pressure this is what we saw from Florida State to start the game but theres a difference in the pressure after 36 minutes of game time in comparison to in the first four and McLoud rejects that one and its out of bounds official time on the bo Purdue leading it by S on the road 351 to go 915 Eastern itll be North Carolina and Indiana and following us Michigan State and Notre Dame over on the you itll be Boston College and Nebraska could come down to your alma mater at Nebraska tonight what happens if its close you know 77 is the tie yep weve seen it multiple times and Grant the fellas going to have to deliver Applause yeah the ACC came into today with a 5 to3 lead in The Music Applause Challenge from way downtown lawyer little strong another stop for Florida State this is where theyre going to have to make that push three and a half remaining you cant continue to allow Purdue to be able to play with the sevenpoint cushion Cleveland jump stop of the paint lost the hand Cleveland and green have been their offense in this game shot clock at six Cleveland little short Applause Applause Music Smith hesitates ball fake into the E flips it up and in hes got a game high 25 points and hes played a game high 32 minutes the fitness is really impressive almost as impressive as the hands that is a difficult situation to put a 7 fo4 guy in but he continues to be successful Music yeah the hands are the hands are good he gets it in a certain spot he hes able to secure it almost every time it seems but you know there have been a number of times where theres really like why would Brandon BR Smith pass him to basketball right there but he continues to make it look so easy where you say well thats why because hes got great hands Music green and now Mills loose ball Mills gets it back fires it up and the tip ends up with Mills trying to scoop it home couldnt do it and E the rebound fla States had his chances here just unable to be able to get it to go down and thats been the struggle for the nolles throughout this young season is finishing basketball games had a 19point lead on this floor against Florida ended up surrendering that lead and losing that game and they just got an offensive foul on Ed Zach Edy talking to Jeffrey Anderson wanting to know he was pulled he was not trying to run and create the contact he was pull into the contact as you see Edy setting the screen Caleb Mills tries to go under and Caleb Mills does a great job of selling that because he does pull Edie into that foul green shot contested and a big rebound from Gillis so Purdue basketball under 90 seconds to go and the lead is nine Smith gets Music bumped right now Matt P having a conversation with his point guard trying to get him to understand time and score with a lead and a full shot clock theres no reason to penetrate and go downhill fortunately for Smith he was bailed out but Matthew painter who was a very tall guard himself not a big man he was a guard but hes not happy with his point guard and again hes a freshman Matt painer has the ability though to deliver the criticism and be angry and also funny at the same time like hes delivering the criticism and all the coaches and you can see their radio crew and some of the other people plus the officials are smiling yes what because its funny its funny to us it might not be funny to bra Smith fair enough but its definitely funny to us but I mean again but Matt painer of course as a great coach but hes right dont go in there theres no reason nothing good happens for you up nine theres no theres no need to stop the Applause Music Music clock kick out Cleveland thats a three and count it and thats the evolution of Matthews Clevelands game if he can add that consistently his game goes to the next level and he becomes a preier score for the Florida state simol with a consistent threepoint shot so the lead is 8 107 to go Timeout on the floor and again Michigan State and Notre Dame coming up 7163 doesnt get any easier for Leonard Hamiltons group their next game is against Virginia do you have that I will be there on the call in Charlottesville for that game look at Virginia then back at home against Louisville who has struggled windless on the season thus far USC Upstate St Johns Notre Dame both here at the tuck so after the road game at Virginia four straight home games for Florida State and if youre Leonard Hamilton regardless of the outcome of this game I believe that you can take away some positives of this and again once in the ACC theres no moral victories but youre playing against one of the best teams in the country and against maybe the best player in the country in Zach Edy right now and for the way that Florida States competed in this game if you clean up some small mistakes this is a winnable game for you yeah there were opportunities where they took the lead opportunities where they could have kept it tighter and again I think one of the topics you look at Baba Miller whos a freshman from Spain suspended for the first 16 games of the year due to a a travel benefit that he received and so this will be now what seven more games he still going to sit out and hell probably end up being one of their best players 16 games is a long a lot that is a lot for I mean again that travel benefit had to have had some extra bonuses or something I mean because if it was just the travel 16 games is a long time that is half the season be inside flexer the deuce and its back to eight the full court pressure Newman double team Newman looking for some help and he gets foul foul call Borton was actually standing right in front of B Smith trying to call the timeout he saw his teammate under the rest 50 point6 to go Applause Newman knocks it Applause down talking to Matt Painter about all the kids and the different sneakers they wear Brandon Newmans rocking some pretty sweet green Kobes those are the mambas I believe I like those yeah very Music nice Im color blind though I think the momas were all black I didnt know they were green until you said it probably should have discussed that PR you know what you you got to tell me these things thats that is totally fair that is on me I led you right into trouble I probably should have told you I was color blind at first here they are Music there a pair of sneakers as a kid that you you grew up they it hadnt quite exploded the way it has now I mean Nike was getting big and Jordans Music Applause Etc the Air Force One okay poster yeah yeah yeah with Moses Malone absolutely you know the what the whole team yeah changed my life I became a sneaker head the first time I saw the Air Force One and Ill be honest with you boo I probably have 100 pair of Air Force ones right now wow and simply because that is what brought me into the sneaker game Applause okay so I like the dunks and the Jordan one I see you rocking the fly dunks right now my man got a nice Shoe Closet Im going have to when I Im going to send you a video of mine when I get home but the dunks and the Jordan one my wife cant tell the difference between the two right they are very similar look and the thing is with before Michael Jordan wore Jordans he wore dumps in the NBA so thats the thing because when he first started playing Jordans were not created yet they were still big manufacturing he did wear them as I did not know that he did wear them his rookie year but he did not wear them to start the rookie year so it was later in his rookie year when he started wearing them he would wear dunks in games prior to that oh wow the lead is Music 10 oh and score the basket and that painters a little frustrated well as a coach you want to make sure that your team finishes the game the right way and again at this point twos dont really hurt you but you dont want to add the free throw by fouling and give them opportunity to to three and stop the five he back in but again its another example Eds back in and he can make free throws yes so that you dont have to take him out down the stretch and be fearful of your big guy not be getting fouled and not being able to go to the line and take care of business Applause Music and theyll March it down to the other end as Brandon Newman will get a chance to shoot so Purdue will escape and improve to S and0 MERS team will head back to West Lafayette here tonight Ill be honest I was not expecting this result Florida State definitely competed here on their home floor and not that I didnt expect for them to but the way Purdue was playing I knew this would be a tough task for the simol but Leonard Hamilton had his team prepared for this action tonight too much Zach eating but outside of that you got to give some of those a lot of credit for the way they competed here on their home Feld yeah big time nice night for Darren Green Cleveland as well house Off the Mark out of bounds and thatll do it and Purdue improves to seven and a oh with a road win 7969 the final Cory enjoyed it great hang out with you my man no doubt Matt payner and Company pick up the win up next Michigan State and Notre Dame lets head out to South B ran kuster Jordan cornette Bs take it away Music
