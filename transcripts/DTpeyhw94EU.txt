having think about what it could be like for Rutgers when Mulcahy gets back into the lineup and then McConnells got his legs underneath him because he played in just the last game thats his first game back and now getting his first start of the season its a big lineup I mean theyre big they share the basketball well they understand who they are and also what theyre not which is a good thing our officials for this one bill Covington Jr Brian OConnell and Tommy Morrissey here tonight from Miami Applause hurricanes one loss in the season to Maryland boy that seems really good Ryan cant wait to see what they can do this year surprising and you dont expect that from year one for Kevin Willard but so far so good and inside to get things started is North Shan ONeill like that theyre going right at Cliff omury hes just a big beast down low he blocks a lot of shots and dunks a lot of basketballs heres your starting five for Rutgers tonight as you said Simpson had been in the starting lineup a true freshman but McConnell is back number 22 well keep an eye on him and his progress here tonight only loss for Rutgers this year was to Temple inside that was volatmag couldnt get it to go omir who does such an amazing job boxing out and getting rebounds has it for Miami but also going straight up there underneath is Jordan Miller on the reverse as you look at the hurricane starting five here tonight Applause pretty solid for them coach larinega told us and he can go six to nine maybe 10 Deep but its a rotation of what two guards two forwards that hes kind of seeing how they youre feeling it out at this point in the season because theyre trying to figure out kind of who can be the initiator the facilitator how can we play Isaiah Wong in this position off the ball Nigel pack still learning that point guard position hes more of a combo guard but obviously handling the basketball somethings not gonna have to do here and Beyond heres McConnell works it into mag Applause going up against Nigel pack nawat Mack and the first basket for Rutgers tonight youve got to find where youre going to have the advantage and you have to play to your advantage if youre Rutgers not a dynamic offensive team theyre so good defensively so they can be efficient on the offensive end part of officiating his excuse me part of efficiency is finding out where you have the advantage heres wolka Poplar pulls up and he hits good start for the Kings shooting in this first couple of minutes of this game and the biggest challenge for Miami when you get one you watch this game is ultimately how do they adjust to the different defenses for Rutgers how do they adjust to his own how do they adjust to a matchup traveling violation coach L how about it his 700th career Victory a couple games ago they honored him here before the game tonight in Medford Fleet when you look at wins at one institution you think of over time that service to the institution when you think of 700 career wins in college basketball thats service to the game so for that I think a lot of us would say thank you Jim larren egg I mean service to the game keeps it going seven plus uh 20 plus winning seasons the most by Miami head coach and hes going to be inducted into the Miami sports Hall of Fame next year this pass knocked down and intercepted by Andre Hyatt thats an example of not reading the Zone correctly if you understand theyre in zone you understand what passing weights are there and our which capacity lanes are not there cant throw through the middle of the zone McConnell working against Isaiah Wong a little bit of a size advantage and he hits it off the window size Advantage but not an easy shot I know for Caleb McConnell its going to be good to see the ball go through the net so you want to take good shots early but but really hes going to get back and find his rhythm on the defensive end Miller again on the reverse one of the foul dont call the Scarlet Knights running down by two here early just over three minutes gone by first half McConnell got a call for the offensive Music another wrap around you talked about it his Defense John Big 10 defensive player of the year last year had 70 steals he does it on both ends of the court its amazing to think how many steals he got and a lot of its on the ball but but he is great in terms of anticipating where the ball is going get it in passing Lane hes got great length but hes played enough basketball to have a good feel for the game a lot of family members and attendance for him here tonight from Jacksonville Florida his mom and Company in the house here close to 2530 family members to watch Caleb McConnell hes back in Action here he is he pulls up from midrange going to get the bounce offensive rebound not there from Meg too strong Applause omir lost the handle off his leg Rutgers possession Music good job of Steve Michael has done seventh season theyve went to backtoback NCAA tournaments probably would have been three straight but obviously 2020 so theyre trying to go back to back to back thats his message for the team this year if they can do it John first team ever in Rutgers history to do that its its hard to put into words the job that Steve pipels done at Rutgers when you think about how irrelevant they were you go to the Big Ten and youre even more irrelevant now you have a team that nationally has talked about as a tough out and quite frankly a couple years ago they should have beaten Houston they had that game one just let it slip away but this is a program thats on the up and up and theyre not doing it by having the best players theyre doing it by developing the best team Hyatt got it knocked out of his hands Wong feeds Poplar runs into a roadblock and thats almost intercepted again Nifty dribbling from Miller behind back for omear that was that was close to being a broken play it was broken on the defensive end because they got scrambling offensively it really comes down to take a broken play and turn it into an opportunity awesome pass from Jordan Miller 84 hurricanes timeout coming at the next whistle we played almost five minutes in the first half and well have that break now as a foul is on omear and a good start here for Miami eight before they leave what do you think here part is this a good play Broken play were just incredibly athletic play look these guys are so skilled it just comes down to whether they can put those skills together make up the type of team that can make another run Music what style of game do you want against this Rutgers team and he went back to his principles said look that wins anywhere and I thought it was a great point Music heres Moana mag four Rutgers McConnell Music Applause again using the window there and its a twopoint game hes using an angle in physicality right he had a good angle to the basket because of that Isaiah Wong coming up trying to take it away coming hard over that stream good angle uses body created space and just off the glass apparently the glass still works sex of Miamis first eight points have been in the paint here tonight Applause AJ Casey is in he kicks with the Miller who misses on the three and McConnells got it Applause Music Amore got it Im sorry to laugh but like he Palms the ball like its a tennis ball and when you watch a dunk because theres a 99 chance hes gonna have a dunk in this game it honestly looks like hes slamming a tennis ball into the basket said you saw that in warmups here as the jumper is off the mark from Nigel pack whos coming off a really good game 16 points in the win at UCF on Sunday evening Music back to McConnell hes had his way here and he tries this one at Short Millers got it Pat good luck to Casey into the script out of his hands by mawat man for only season for Rutgers as you said it Mel cahey the senior guard had like a stinger in his shoulder so hes now missing his fourth game of the season here tonight from McConnells back so its going to be a drastically different looking Rutgers team right as we move forward this season for sure it should be but you hope that they can get it back think about Big Ten starting play first week of December here so thats coming up youve got Indiana then you go to Ohio State so you want to be at full strength but also you want to be at full continuity at that point too we can get into conference play so not enough time together with all the pieces McConnells out of bounds on the sideline thats a good point I mean you look at the early part of the schedule and you feel like okay you can get some wins there which you know I know theres been some Gremlins soon who have you played well yeah thats fine you build up confidence you get some wins and like you just said you had Miami tonight you got Indiana you get Ohio State you got Seton Hall you got Wake Forest so thats a little bit of a stretch if youre Gonzaga and you dont play anybody its hard to figure out how good you are but if youre in the Big Ten I dont care who you play out of conference right like if youre a Rutgers you got to win in the Big Ten to be in the NCAA tournament so Rutgers is in a situation where they dont have to go out and play everybody they need to build with what theyve got they need to develop continuity with this group much different than they were last year Nigel pack kicks it up to the top long foul on the floor its on mag thats his first for Rutgers Miamis doing a good job of moving it relatively quickly theyre cutting hard and when you back cut hard to keep the defense honest you back cut hard they stay towards the pain a little bit and then it leads to Long Closeouts Isaiah walks gotten some long Closeouts hes been able to attack him some been found some have been a driving kick its got Antoine wolf Hulk coming into the game here for Rutgers for the first time tonight number 13 true freshman out of Cleveland Ohio Applause first big man off the bench for them back inside omir speaking of big men and hes fouled hell head to the freethrow line Music difference when Cliff for more hes not in the game you know you just see you Attack the Block right away theres no hesitation from Miami were going to Attack the Block when Cliff from where hes not in the game understandably so coming up next on ESPN the ESPN app 9 15 Eastern the 24th annual ACC Big Ten challenge rolls on with North Carolina and Indiana thats from Bloomington another Sonic Blockbuster coming your way tonight at 9 15 Eastern on ESPN feels like Carolinas trying to replicate their season last year which also means theyre trying to replicate the early season struggles where guards are super selfish and take 50 plus percent of the shots theyll be good late but they may have to learn the hard way in Indiana could wake him up Indiana has the potential to be a really good team this year cam Spencer a lot of traffic underneath you cant get it its tipped out though to Derrick Simpson and they get in for Wolf Hall whos inside against omear gets to step and gets the bucket were tied at 10 if Steve Pike and tied at 10 if you can steal a few minutes with this lineup that would be fantastic for Rutgers this is not a great lineup for Rutgers a lot of your Firepower on the bench Camp Spencers gonna have to be that stabilizer out there McConnells taking a breather right now of course we do have another timeout coming here rather shortly he is packed backs off the defender gives it up here for Anthony Walker and that is going the other way we will be back in a moment eight minutes gone by from Miami were all tied at 10 Music in Miami 1010 Rutgers and the Miami Hurricanes Mike Corey John Chrisman here on the ACC Big Ten challenge got the game coming up right after us BC at Nebraska as this battle rolls on here this week Rutgers travels he didnt know that yeah right and heres the thing there are places that you travel to there are other places that you say ah hard pass Miamis not one of them you make the trip to Miami when you can Music also when you have players that have ties to the State of Florida its a good excuse to come back for a visit Caleb McConnells family in the house his mother Stephanie right up the road in Jacksonville Florida come down here to watch him play and what was he telling us about earlier you know he had some workouts with the NBA came back wanted to play won the win one to finish off strong and what were we hearing about his Prospect at the next level who knows about what his real Prospect is but what you do through those workouts is you kind of get an idea of where you stand like what do I need to work on obviously you think people are confident in who he is as a Defender but can you create can you be a knock down shooter I mean those are things you have to do we talk about three and E guys at the next level its real uh if you can defend multiple positions if you can make threes you may have a chance I think when you go through that process youre humbled a little bit by how many incredibly talented players are out there Im sure I know I was uh but even really high level guys that you think might be a first round second round draft pick youre humbled by the process because not only are there a lot of guys coming out the same year youre trying to come out theyre a lot of grown men who have been scratching and clawing in the gleg overseas and in the CBA if it still exists and some domestic SemiPro leagues they want to keep playing ball and It Aint Easy and thats the thing you just said that its not just about here in this country its internationally and its really only about the first round these days the other thing is well why does the NBA not want freshmen they dont want projects you know theyll take some if theres theres high level potential but if you dont want projects you look overseas you get some of these 18 19 year olds overseas theyve been playing against grown men for three four five years its the reason why Luka doncia can come in and be effective right Mattoon same thing when he got to the league because hes been playing against men Isaiah Wong was called for the foul from Miami Spencer gives it up on top this is Jalen Miller who misses a three fight for the rebound and more he had a hand on it instead its Miamis Miller as he dumps it underneath the Poplar great play probably not the best thing in the world to jump in the air in that situation but he read it really well made a great play a little misdirection with the eyes not enough Defenders back for Rutgers first Miami field goal in over four minutes they had started two for three and were two of seven cents to that last bucket right there and they have a twopoint lead think this is a tough scoring lineup for Rutgers tough shot here from Spencer and rebound goes into the hands along hes got Bensley Joseph for three and thats in and out Applause Music and a nice talk with Bensley Joseph earlier today that Team guys his role is continuing to develop just a second year sophomore number four from Miami yeah your role should have gone and you get on the floor however you can get on the floor thats a guy whos willing to do whatever it takes look out that things that thing hit above the square long the other way counted to the foul and thats been a big deal so far from Rutgers the last few possessions the jump shots have been the first pass of the break for Miami theyve been off and running hes gonna stop Isaiah Wong hes just too gifted hes played enough basketball to understand how he gets his but for Rutgers a tough lineup not a good offensive lineup some jump shots that go the other way and Miami is right back in control of this game how many minutes they go without a bucket four four minutes Derek Simpson called for the foul for Rutgers long calves off the threepoint play all ACC 13 selection the last two years in records at times well go through lulls offensively Im not even sure what that is they have the potential to be good but they just theyve done it year over year Hyatt for three count it that was a good if it goes not if it doesnt that type of shot coach Michael recruited him out of high school second year of the program transfer out of LSU nice speed to Miller for the bucket Jim Blair Davis said were not sure what defense there we just get into some action I said whats the action ball screen well nobody really defends the ball Street particularly well and Miami just exposed that that was a nice feed from long thats the thing sometimes just changing your defense you know gets a team off balance for that possession and Rutgers does it so often that you could really create some some issues heres another three submissions too I I like the switching defenses they dont pressure they dont pick you up full court theyll extend their pressure a little bit but its not willing to get a steal to score its more about just disrupting the rhythm of the game eighth threepointer of the season for higher than second on the team and he pulls Rutgers within one as Wong tries to do it all here through traffic and he gets it its a big time playing Im not sure Rutgers can switch and give up the matchup where you have Caleb McConnell on Isaiah one youve got to get the ball out of his hands and get Kayla McConnell back on McConnell coming to work himself kicks it back Spencer for three in the tie yes three threes in a row for Rutgers its 19 all between Andre Hyatt there and Kim Spencer once again Rutgers goes through a little bit of a low comes back three straight threes and now were tied up we got a ball game here lets go set lets just line them up and drain it but this this next one with Cam Spencer this is good offense and thats Kayla McConnell doing what he knows how to do get into the pink get that pink touch one of those principles who talked about 10 rules thats one that Miami doesnt want to allow they do not want to allow paint touches that lead to open threes and you look at the shooting percentage 75 percent from three for Rutgers the thing that jumps out to me in this game when you look at a 1919 score you think Rutgers the bigger team theyre going to dominate the pain its not how it goes 146 in terms of points in the paint and its not about feeding the posts its about attacking off the bounce Miamis been able to get there Isaiah Wong has sex omir or Isaiah ones got five omearas got six from Miami and the top scorer Hyatt for Rutgers as you said with those two threepointers theres Amir North Shadowmere first Nicaraguan to play division one college basketball NCAA active leader in career rebounding average I mean the guys been outstanding transfer out of Arkansas state brings that energy and just that powerful presence experience the game in college basketball has gotten older and older because of all these transfer rules and I think its probably the best thing about the transfers I know we want kids to be able to go where they want and have the freedom onetime church thats fine but I think the best thing is we have more experience on teams long for three its short Music Applause Music Applause everybody says we want to get old and stay old well the transfer portal is another way to do it thats how you do it now whether you have the chemistry or not thats always the challenge Music Applause pass intercepted McConnell heres Poplar and thats going to be picked off Spencers got it and Spencer gets it stolen away from pack getting back on t heres Wong and he holds it up rebound pulled in by Hyatt the best sequence its been a good game so well live with us Rutgers is looking for their first lead of the night five turnovers for Rutgers four for Miami so far heres Hyatt and its a traveling violation but to your point about a lot of transfers and this and that how about both of these teams did not lose anyone to the portal thats pretty amazing it is and Im sure people can come up with their reasons why but its the two desirable programs youre also coming off of a suite or excuse me an elite eight appearance why the heck would you want to leave that and I understand guys are getting better offers or options elsewhere but its a program only up and up and Rutgers is certainly such as well new facilities its a big difference youre not playing for Rutgers five six years ago youre playing for Rutgers which is naturally relevant nowadays Applause Music challenge for Nigel pack kind of being off the ball but but being asked to handle it from time to time its gonna take some time for him to really grow into his role and let that role evolve mag for three its good and that stops a little mini spurt that you dont want for Rutgers he had three turnovers in the last four possessions and now theyve got their first lead of the night 2219 on another three fourth one of the game Music Applause coming up on six minutes to play first half long slashing through how about that yeah that yeah that was just a little miscommunication Cliff Memorial was saying ice ice meaning you got to force him to the Baseline where hes got his help Simpson Cross Court to Hyatt back on top for McConnell Applause the posters Mack James McConnell nice little touch pass underneath and score it for Clifford Amore as he finally gets into the ax here for Rutgers and he will he he doesnt have to do it on his own he doesnt have to sit on the Block and wait for the ball hell get his opportunities with good ball movement steal Simpson from McConnells rejected by omir but put back up and in by mawat Knack Rutgers starting to get more and more active there on the offensive glass particularly when the shots come closer to the rim those long shots led to Long rebounds and run outs from Miami heres pack Five Point Ruckers lead almost another steal and Miller counter foul is called on Derek Simpson its his second for Rutgers long Closeouts and gambles just get you beat and they put your teammate you put your teammates in a bad situation so you know Macs gonna go for that steal and by going for the steal and not getting it its now five on four so youre asking Defenders to scramble cover the threepoint line but also protect the rim thing you want to do is put somebody like Clint Memorial in a bad situation to pick up fouls because youre gambling around the perimeter when truthfully thats not who you are defensively Jordan Miller has been outstanding fifth year senior second year with a program third team Atlantic 10 selection and George Mason a couple of years ago and of course the connection of larenegger being the coach there previously now here at Miami and its just done an awesome job they said you could almost make a case that you know he is one of our best players on this team heres a three and its good by Hyatt whats going into him tonight three for three sometimes when you see the first one go youre reported a heat check and if the heat check goes all bets are off five of six for Rutgers from threepoint land and Miami is oh for five Miller directing traffic Applause tries to find omir somehow he collects it and puts it in is tough he understands how to operate in a small area not an easy catch just gets his balance and finishes on the opposite side of the rib everybodys aware of Cliff omorian hes a shot blocker so you have to get to the opposite side of the river fourth annual Big 12 Big East battle tomorrow night weve got two games for you top seven matchup here Creighton in Texas Seton Hall in Kansas thats a nine oclock to follow it up tomorrow on ESPN and ESPN app I really like this Creighton team Im a fan of Texas what Chris Beards doing but I just feel like theres still more upsides for Creighton do you think length ball movement Pace hell remind me a little bit in terms of the movement the pace of a Gonzaga in Arizona which I think is antifragile and impossible to stop theres a three Amore he was left wide open offensive rebound by Hyatt Music Applause Spencer resets see if anybody correctors knows that Andre Hyatts three for three points yeah right yeah get it to him Spencer misses thats thats where a really good point guard understands Andre Heights the feeling we got to get him the ball somehow theres got to be an action that gets him involved McConnell trying to get a steal and a contact no ball here is Poplar hes puts up a three thats in and out by him is still missing on all their threepoint attempts but thats what omir does Applause Music hes not going to push him around omoris got the length Advantage but in terms of outworking him I I got to give him here the advantage right I mean he just goes afterward harder than anyones on so physically strong ball is loose and its picked up by long Applause six nothing run Miami has regained the lead over the last one minute and 35 seconds its been that kind of game gave him runs back and forth so you could string together a few good possessions Music mag green section Poplar oh and a little bit of trash talking going on there as well at the end of that play that so they can understand that theres a tremendous amount of talent its also a great baseball player back in high school as well I think I think we undervalue what we have in terms of opportunity not only to play but to get better here in this country the resources given to this game its insane when you really understand the financial dollars that are given to this game to the teams here to have the facilities to have the training the health care the food everything that we have we take it for granted we truly do AAU I mean kids are sixth graders and they got fresh shoes for every game I mean its weve probably crossed the line at some point and its not recent weve cried across the line a long time ago but but it takes someone from another country to really point that out how lucky we are yeah hes appreciative for everything theres no doubt about it and has another big rebound here in this game hes got five already to go along with a gamehigh 10 points hurricanes lead it by one coming up on two minutes remaining first half pack from NBA range Applause tough one theres no rhythm in that shot what do you want to see here offensively for Rutgers Applause its a tough lineup I just theyve had some challenging lineups I dont know where the offense is going to come from but you gotta get got to get Andre Hyatt back involved somehow well youre fine with that you have a guy thats knocked down three straight threepoint shots hes got to get a look and what you have to do is you have to read what the defense does around him are they going to run him off the line theres no way theyre going to let us let him step into a shot shoot over the three that was the right call thats goaltending yep Dean Reber gets the basket for Rutgers as omear called for the goal 10 almost a steal from Reber Miamis over seven from threepoint range here tonight but theyre shooting 50 percent from the field overall now Miller wants the first three of the game and hes got it and that was a good job by Matt Abby recognizing the defense moving the ball be patient now you also have to watch at some point Rutgers in that 23 Zone may switch out and go man they did not so they were patient kept moving it and got themselves a good look Millers got 10 points to tie omir for the game high for Wong as well usually when Im quiet its because Im trying to figure out whats going on yeah Johnson team five yeah dont worry hell hell come up with something heres a three from Hyatt its his first Miss of the night McConnell cleans it up and a foul is called and Rutgers has a chance to regain the lead from the freethrow line I I like that Andre Hyatt got a look I would rather that they work the ball for him that they ran something to be able to get him an open look maybe drive and kick because you knew at some point if hes not touching the basketball hes three for three for three hes going to shoot the basketball so best if you do something for him to get a good look and then if he misses then you start to scale back you get back into your action but again you watch that ball go out hard close out shot goes up another Defenders behind him and you have opportunities on the offensive glass yeah absolutely no box out that time on McConnell as he went right through the lane to get that rebounds in the bucket Miller checks back in for Kim Spencer for Rutgers omir goes to the bench for Miami because he just picked up his second person to fouled only the third with only 45 485 seconds remaining first half and Rutgers is back in front Caitlyn McConnell should feel good getting back into action to talk to us and he said look I just got to find a rhythm again you can do that on that on the defensive end first and I think hes starting to find out where hes going to fit in with this group offensively Diner team has led by more than five points were in a onepoint game here now with an 18 second differential shot clock game clock faking on the three pensley Joseph heres the pack for three no good Millers got it shot clock reset the 20 still 23 seconds left in the half Applause Casey passes out of trouble in the corner and a timeout taken by Miami 141 remaining in the first half will be back in 30 seconds Rutgers is running that zone again Id still screen the top I would set a ball screen on the top of that zone I dont think theyre going to be in zone but I would look to get Isaiah Wong turning the corner and if someone steps up to switch then you clear and give him room to work play to your matchup advantage heres Nigel pack gets the Miller and he hands off the Wong Zone you got to screen it Joseph passed the Miller dangerous there its intercepted and stolen Rutgers Jalen Miller three seconds hes blocked by bedsley Joseph and the follow is not there and thats the end of the half they didnt get a shot off but did a nice job there in an outlet Rutgers got a late basket lets see that again not the prettiest of plays obviously a bit of a breakdown Bentley Joseph made the right point if you have no size at all but you have guys that can break it down off the bounce get inside the paint lead to a driving kick now you get long Closeouts now you get to the basket so easier opportunities when you have guards that can get there yeah and the tallest guy that got out there six seven so yeah they dont have a very tall team Miami one of the smallest in the country ranking outside of the top 2 30 nationally actually in average height heres McConnell on the drive to get things started in the second half offensive rebounder Mori keeps it alive for the Scarlet Knights Music what about a Mori how do they get him more involved here now theyre trying to get him on the post I wouldnt over commit to getting Cliff omury the ball and I doesnt mean he cant do anything with it he gets his own and he impacts the game in his own way and right like this offensive rebounds and stick backs why why go out of your way to stare him down just to throw him the ball if theres a way where you can get him along the Baseline maybe get him on the block with the defender on his back thats one thing but its not that dominant type of postpresence on the offensive side of the ball doesnt mean he wont get 1516 points a game he does but he does it more on his own than anything else you just called him right on cue theyre off to the two misses from Spencer and Amore puts it back up and in and with the free throw after the foul on wooka Poplar its Rutgers by four just underway here in the second half I would also say its hard to live in the paint if someones occupying the block so you have a dominant big but he cant really get the ball in the banks the defense is taking that away so so vacating the paint from time to time is whats giving Miami opportunities Isaiah Wong shut off the foul line Works through the lane rejected by McConnell Applause on the kick for Spencer back in for kale McConnell speed away over Miller love that shot not just because they got taken out all the time when I shot it but its the greatest way to get Space without sending the chicken wing to Defenders way saying you didnt have a high percentage with that one oh I shot a decent percentage its just one of those things like we barely allowed to shoot threes gotcha Amir he couldnt get his feet away McConnell with a rebound up to Spencer Applause Music Applause shut off the base side of Maury timeout Miami and Im gonna give that one to cam Spencer cam Spencer did a masterful job of working that Baseline just in terms of reading defense hes got his head up the entire time shows the ball high throws it down largest lead of the game for Rutgers foreign dont ever give up Carter with a V Foundation to highlight the urgent need for cancer research this is game changing research that helps save lives please join the fight against cancer by visiting vorg donate 100 of your donation goes directly to cancer research yeah and that speech was was kind of the ignition moment right for for a huge huge movement that that really has changed the world in a number of ways but its also inspired a lot of people in this great game to be awesome uh theres a lot of people at ESPN I think he has been done a great job of carrying on the Legacy but theres a lot of good people that have done the same and I think I commend the people that have carried towards so to speak and have done nothing but build from whats in Valvano started that night I mean amazing hell do more with everything outside of basketball that Ill ever do in my life and for that you just cant say enough Applause let alone thanks for helping make it industry I get them high it for three no good for Rutgers Applause big tennis ball and a bucket is hanging about seven feet off the ground thats what its like for him to Dunkle basketball Music Applause wow Music packed for three rebound omir and somehow he puts that up in it Nigel Packs got to get his feet set hes got to get shot ready theres no reason why thats not a step into in Rhythm three he hasnt found Rhythm because hes been catching not ready to shoot I had asked about trying to get Amore back in a little bit more involved but hes certainly seen it here in the second half that was an unbelievable Throwdown on that last sequence so they got another chance at it here in the offensive rebound lets see what theyre doing here now unmanned in the late clock situation Applause hes got 11 points now which leads Rutgers and scoring two seconds to shoot he comes up a three and thats good Applause the junior Clifford amore NBA potential out of Nigeria on the Kareem Abdul watch list for the top Center in the country Applause and here is omir guarded by amore runs into a double team and a foul is going to be called Applause Music all right so watch tennis ball Music the feet above the ground it just Palms that thing and throws it down like its nothing look at the reach oh like its its humbling and then its made even more humbly when he goes out knocks down a three its just impressive I mean you talk about NBA potential I almost feel like anybody who plays at this level has NBA potential its just that people arent reasonable enough with their potential right their potential is not to be Kobe Bryant or Lebron James or Michael Jordan your potential might be to be Al Horford somewhere down the road where you just make a career of being a great teammate yeah thank you very much is right I mean last year he was number one number two in terms of dunks in the nation and he could be the first first round pick since Quincy doobie back in 2006 for Rutgers who had a threeyear NBA career respect 19th back then in 2006 doobie is actually coaching at Somerset Academy Charter High here in Miami got his first win as a varsity head coach the other day thought he might be in attendance tonight but hes out there coaching his team Amore is delivering in this second half what a gamehigh 14 points as Rutgers has a 10 point lead here in my partner he asked me how do you get Cliff omury involved well you do absolutely nothing hes going to figure it out on his own somehow he gets lost within the defense now those were switching defenses a couple guys dont realize theyre End Zone but this is what he does hes able to physically dominate he gets the basketball tough situations where its the only thing you can do is foul and if hes knocking down threes look out well on Lookout offensive rebounding advantage to Rutgers 125 Second Chance points 154 you see what Amores done here in the second half and then Miami entering the game shooting 33 percent from threepoint raise not that bad and then tonight theres just one for 11 from the outside and its a 10point Buckners lead a big part of that if Nigel Packs gotten some decent looks just hasnt seen anyone go down I think hes got to really work off the basketball to be shot ready when I say shot ready youre stepping into the shot as youre receiving the basketball Villanova says that we talked about it you know I did that game Villanova and Temple it shot ready means you are catching and already in your shooting motion by the time ball gets done Villanova two and five the start of the Season another played a lot of tough competition they got some injuries yeah no Justin Moore theyre a different team but tough no James J Wright is probably the biggest deal of all Miami won for their last six and thats here in this half and a three ball from Miller he changes that decent defensive possession but if Miami can start seeing it go through the hoop again get multiple stops this has been that type of game right run after run who can string them together Millers got 13 with omir for the team high for Miami now Connollys fouled and well have two free throws coming up you know we talk about flow and Rhythm its really hard against Rutgers because of what they do in terms of switching their defense disguising their defenses kind of hiding what theyre doing at times theyll show a 23 drop out into a man not sure if thats a man or a matchup gotta read the principles ultimately you just got to play ball second fouling Isaiah Wong the finals got one more free throw coming up tonight 9 15 eastern North Carolina Indiana on ESPN the ESPN app before us as the ACC Big Ten challenge rolls on you were saying anywhere too pleased with North Carolinas early action kind of like what it was last year its kind of like its typical where you like have a great season you finish up so strong and you forgot all the little things that made you who you were late uh Pete Nance is filling in for kind of that Brady manic roll spacer but also good Defender good length but its been so guard heavy to start and thats hard to believe when youve got a Armando Bay cocktail mode Miller again for three not good and Amore there for the rebound Applause Spencer keeps it over for Andre Hyatt can lose money in the first half of three threepointers Amore not a good pass that time for mag quickly on the run as Nigel pack dumps it from Miller and hes fouled so in transition thats one thing Miami said hey we can beat them up the floor in transition dont have to worry about those changing defenses all the time for Rutgers in the half points you dont want to allow Rutgers to get set I didnt say you dont want to play against the set defense so the best way to do it is force it up the floor and then make them respond to you make them chase make them Scramble now youre in control of The Possession anytime you dont know what youre doing or dont know what theyre in it leads to a reset and that means the defense resets too where they get to see the basketball communicate get set up mag with a second personal foul Miller whos the youngest of four Jeffrey Javon and Justin he was telling us last week he trained with his brothers friend during covet in boxing and was learning a lot on what it took to be a boxer controlling your breathing handeyed coordination some stuff that hes transferred over you know to the basketball court and then after basketball he said whenever thats done once again the TV broadcasting no he does yes he does he got enough competition now boxing a lot of guys like boxing in terms of the training they dont like boxing means theyre getting hit right thats something you just cant appreciate I I dont get big into the UFC I I can squeamish at times but man I give those guys credit for being able to focus the way they do in such a physical fight yeah and taking those hits youre absolutely right heres McConnell as he scores on the midrange and hes back into the flow here now just a second game back missed six weeks for the knee injury Applause and hes got 13 points one off his teammate Amore for the team hot Music half and the more hes got it that was good offense but just better defense and the better defense Im talking about for Rutgers was the scramble they they scrambled out to the basketball three separate times where they were chasing the play but took the shot away three balls blocks by Harlan Beverly from Miami Applause Im Gonna Make The Point again because at halftime coming out of the break I was watching Paul Mulcahy who again is out again with a shoulder injury I was watching him interact with players and what you saw was an experienced leader and its not just in what hes doing or saying its how the team responds to him which means thats a significant loss not not having mokay here is significant and its significant when youre trying to build a team for Big Ten play as well Spencer coming off the spring gets the ball in the inbound theres wolf whos back in Forum Mori hes going to get a breather hes got 14 points and eight rebounds the average is a doubledouble and hes on his way there again heres Wolf Hall shot clock two got it off and its ripped away by Miller on the rebound Music Jordan Miller tipped up and in by one all right so this is a lineup but Im looking at it youre asking for Caleb McConnell Kim Spencer Andre Hyatt hasnt really been doing as much in the second half but youre asking for them to do a lot when your offense is to throw it into Wolf Hall and ask him to make a play thats going to be tough sled and they try to go inside and its intercept and its long again not not a good offensive lineup for Rutgers right now long for three Applause and thats what you do you punish a bad lineup by attack and you punish a bad lineup by just taking the ball away from you take away passing Lanes force a bad shot you get the ball inside you think you have the advantage you do not Miami took that away and then they went on the attack on the other end youve got to punish a bad lineup That is a quick fivepoint run by Miami to cut the lead in half well you look at the offensive glass you get beat no one stops the basketball no one blocks out Isaiah walk he gets to the rim tips it in and then the other end Im not sure where youre going here this isnt your offense if your Rutgers and then no one really stops the ball good screen no one steps up Isaiah walk again and this is what its been back and forth now the problem is for Rutgers I dont know whats back and whats forth whats good and whats bad for Rutgers hes saying it was good when you had a good lineup in but you lost it with one or two pieces out so thats where I go back to that Paul McCain being out thats significant you just dont have the confidence with some of the bench players that have to play significant minutes talking about the senior out of Bayonne New Jersey at six seven didnt play in the last three games this is his fourth game missed with a shoulder stinger and he had never missed a game in his career until these last games that hes missed here this season he led the Big Ten in assists last season talking about that senior guard thats out for Rutgers and a steal here by Wong all of a sudden hes doing everything Applause Music was not really going anywhere on that possession didnt get into anything just not going anywhere theres nothing there and yes Isaiah Wong comes up with the the steal and Cliff omury picks up the chief foul they came right back in and he was called for the foul Music second Miami began one for 11 from threepoint range so theyre two for their last three now Music foreign Applause takes it in strong what do we have offensive foul Jordan Miller I I dont know whats happening we just dont call travels anymore but when you catch the ball and then step into it thats the Trap yeah Im sorry weve gotten to the point where we try to justify it with whatever the NBA is doing say well The Gather rules or were going to allow the step back that takes four steps backwards right and I love the people that argue its they just say their argument is its not a travel its great youre all your experience in the game tells me its not a travel its a travel offensive foul Rutgers Dan Rieber Dean Reber called for his first and this will take us to a timeout just under 12 minutes to go from Miami Kanes in a comeback Trail deficit is only five five Rutgers leads it by five the lead has been cut in half they had a 10point Advantage Rutgers with seven turnovers total of the first half and theyve got four in the last three minutes here John whats going on I think at times its lineups I mean you you look at the different groups Rutgers has had on the floor theres no real continuity theres certainly no flow and defensively poor communication its going to be a challenge not a lot of teams are incredibly deep but but Rutgers is one where you can go into your bench but you are going to sacrifice something and right now theyre sacrificing too much Isaiah Wong pulls up tough shot and he hits it Applause Isaiah Wong if Kayla McConnells not in the game youve got to attack with Isaiah 1 you can get to the basket he can pull up some jumpers I say walls did really good tonight this is a seven nothing run over the last one minute and 10 seconds for Miami get right back into this thing Simpson gets it to him Mori and the outstretched arm with a length lays it up and in from Point Blank Range it was incredible I mean he looked like he was going out of bounds like hes going to jump out on the Baseline it just extends the left arm and finishes thats not going to be your offense though what going inside the Clinton where hes not going to be what wins the game this will help Showtime Zurich Simpson Applause but remember when you see this this group Kayla McConnell on the bench a few other starters on the bench its all about stealing a few minutes 5447 Rutgers just got the last two buckets and Laurie with a game high 16 points I think what Rutgers did there in terms of going back and trusting that man I wanted to see him play some man and this is just as simple screen actually trying to turn that corner you feel behind great read by Simpson Applause bounce to everybody that was that like there was a time there was a high school when I was like oh wow wow you guys have two guys on your team that can dunk you know our high school warmup and half the time kids cant shoot but they can Doug its impressive Music well Derek Simpson controlling it now here the true freshman ball gets knocked out of bounds done a good job understanding that theyre undersized youve got to play If Youre Gonna front you gotta play backside help and with the backside help hasnt been there its often been against the zone so when theyre sitting in zone you dont have that backside help youre gonna get beat but when its there you just force a tough pass Music got it swings it out Andre Hyatt wide open for three not there rebound by Miller Applause popplers put a little quiet tonight gonna get that one omear battling again I mean hes that one guy right there hes always going after him lets say Hes listed at because he looks six five six seven yeah he looks six five six six its like Charles Barkley six seven two forty eight number fifteen in white for Miami heres Simpson on the tank no foul rebound omir heres Wong Miller wants an alleyoop he doesnt decide to do that and he takes it out and well set something up Applause pop work Miller for three Max got the rebound its a challenge right now for Isaiah walk he needs a shooter on the floor he needs somebody to kick too but also someone to keep defense out around the perimeter hasnt been the night for Nigel pack though all of eight from the 404 from three hes gotten decent looks 44 shooting for the game 33 percent of this half from Miami Applause inside amore nope Here Comes Joseph Applause nine minutes to play in this contest Music Applause Music Miamis largest lead is five Rutgers largest lead is 11 seven right now Leslie Joseph not there Miller offensive rebound feeds the cutting omir and free throws coming Applause Music oh it was close I dont live for Lori once that verticality on that play but youve got to turn and square yourself to the shooter he was sideways went up and yeah while he had his hands up in the air hes sideways you got to be straight up facing the defender or offensive players thats his third personal foul for Clifford and Maury Music Two Shots foreign what a lineup we got coming up for you on Saturday starts at noon with the big 12 Championship followed up by the American Athletic Conference Championship and then the ACC championship before Sunday at noon for the college football playoff selection show well have the exclusive reveal the final college football football playoff rankings and find out whos going to be playing in the fiesta and Peach bowls all coming up this weekend TCU win that game I think they do I think they do I think they get in there I think a lot of people are kind of pulling for them right they have to youre sitting there at three right now and validate your season win here college football playoff Georgia seems to be pretty darn good though what a year for them whos Michigan yeah Sunny dice an amazing job at TCU this season big weekend coming up inside with a hook is mawatt Mack something we havent seen a lot from Hawaii mag and see them step out shoot some shots but to really take the initiative to find a matchup that you like and attack it on the on the bounce Junior from Australia puts Rutgers back up by seven Music Joseph slashes for the defenseley Joseph none of that this Factor glue guy million other cliches or analogies to talk about what he does for this program but we only see if you can get somehow involved in the finish in this game he got 7 45 left and he hasnt really impacted this game yet Spencer for the Scarlet Knights Applause kayak she has to throw himself up in the hoop its taken away and pensley Josephs Off to the Races Applause a job by Nigel now youre sealing that off I think its soccer they call that a Coachman thats all I know mag well they just shoot for Rutgers crowd is on their feet cant silence some of that shot but an offensive rebound of the three by Hyatt tapped by Amore saved from going out by highend what a play Brown orange juice louder 10 to shoot again McConnell pulls up finally its rebounded by Nigel path thatll tie it Applause said it at some point you got to get Nigel pack going hes got to be able to impact his game and its not just about him scoring its about him now drawing Defenders further from the basket where you can start to attack the pain again whether its on the bounce or the pass Nigel pack steps right into it thats just too easy 53 for Miami and its stuck a little bit with the defense but theyve also been aggressive on the offensive end they have been the aggressor here late in the second half its been back and forth a bit but if you get Nigel pack going late look out different team youve got to defend here for the final 609 well you can see it and over the last 10 minutes Rutgers had led by 11 but theres been two separate seven nothing Miami runs that have got them right back into it we are now tied 609 remaining the last lead from Miami was with 120 left in the first half theyre up 3331 and I like what Miamis done defensively just switching things up from time to time being disruptive on their own with switching defenses and Ive got to say omir has Applause hes taken that advantage that you come into a game with Cliff omore you think you have the advantage omirs taking that away he has matched him you know poundforpound fight for fate its all been there that ones been a bit of a wash then exactly the numbers are so similar omearas got 15 points and eight rebounds omeary oh Maury excuse me has 16 points today rebounds so its right there exactly right heres Derek Simpson now for Rutgers Applause falls down lost the ball Miller had it for the moment Ned gets it back and now were gonna have a tie up and a jump ball is called and its Miami possession just some bad possessions offensively for Rutgers I mean getting it in a bad spot trying to put it on the floor not sure where youre going there just nowhere to work because he got cliff omori on the Block so youre driving right at an occupied block and it plays into the hands of Miami he now gets the basketball you extend this defense I would be cautious because Miamis got ball handles that can dribble right through it Applause a little bit of pressure here from Rutgers with a tie game at 56 just under six minutes to play Applause Ensley Joseph is going to bring it up Music the guy that was born in Miami was here for just eight months before moving to Massachusetts now back to Nella Steele McConnell he got it knocks away and its out of bounds off of long a good job to stop a basket and transition I like this matchup I like the Caitlin McConnell Big Ten defensive player of the year versus Isaiah Wong and they have been back and forth but Wong has matched him on the other end too hes been physical in the defensive end Spencer for three and youre shaking your head as its rebounded by Miami if you dont shoot it right away then you dont shoot it at all that little hesitation takes all the Rhythm out of the shot it becomes a low percentage shot omear gives it up the pack Miller for three in the lead Counting Applause they hit 13 in the first half theyve hit four here in the second half Godzilla bounds stays with Rutgers no omirs doing a terrific job of fronting in the post but getting on that high side you get on that high side youre just taking all the passing opportunities away just been opportunistic on the offensive end hitting shots that one go back omirs defense is kind of the unsung hero in this game youve taken that Advantage Away by forcing omori into bad spots on the catch Hyatt for three to tie it back up front room had a handout of an instead Hyatts gonna have it Applause she slashes through and flanks that one and its still gonna be Rutgers possession its a 10nothing run right now by Miami yeah records up 158 in terms of Second Chance points and its not that theyve dominated the offensive glass theyve just kept possessions alive Spencer for the tie its a better shot tips by Wong into the heads of Miller hes got packed and it got knocked away and stolen that was Spencer back on D number 10 for Rutgers Applause second in the nation and steals this program thats why Applause McConnell mag underneath higher yes one point game Applause the other thing about Rutgers is their first in the nation in Perimeter defense threepoint percentage defense opponent shooting just 18 coming into the game and that was first aid true in the first half not here in the second half Miami score of eight Amir to the hole not there he couldnt get it Connell intercepted Bensley Joseph three on one Applause foreign lead for the hurricanes with 3 13 to go well be back what at the time obviously but this was you know as you started to see things come together for Rutgers started to see the fight and it was different 2018 Rutgers ends up winning this game and they started to look like a team that you could see being an NCAA tournament teams whether they could win in the Big Ten threepoint victory for them and now here we are tonight Music Applause where the hurricanes have taken control on some big runs here you see it 122 over the last four minutes and 49 seconds now the problem is theyve given up some runs as well so its kind of big tits attack your turn my turn basketball and look thats the way the game played nowadays where you get up and down the floor sometimes you make shots sometimes Miss shots you got to be able to flow with it but I think Miamis had more answers in terms of being able to find a way to score being able to get the ball off the bounce into the paint and cause problems for the defense get the ball inside the back to Cleveland Moore he really hasnt been dominant down low hes made plays hes impacted the game but hasnt dominated it anyway and I know youre looking to see a little bit better of an offensive set here for Rutgers uh with the possession right now yeah and I think this is where you start to see no Paul Mulcahy yeah thats a big deal hes there hes their stabilizer their anchor the facilitator their initiator but he also has a great feel for the game he knows where the ball wants to go senior guards been out for the last four games Rutgers did have it on the 11 point lead in this game as Spencer misses a three Millers got the rebound they are one for the last 10 and theyre taking away the credit wants a foul back to Spencer McConnell for the three of the tie thats good foreign Applause Music but the second chance opportunities are killer for a defense he did everything right you didnt secure the rebounder or careless with the basketball on the rebound 158 Second Chance points in favor of Rutgers McConnells got 16 that was his first threepoint attempt and make for the night well they didnt even count that one as a second chance Point apparently my mind is eight three good point heres pack of the runner its not there its tipped around omirs got it and hes battling with mawat nag of Rutgers theyre going to call a jump coach Furious from Miami he wants a foul instead its going to be Ruckers possession again not a second chance point because it doesnt come off from a rebound but you create a second opportunity with the steal and you can get Kayla Mercado in open three you tie this thing up theres so many correctable issues in this game for both teams like youre that close to pulling and pulling away but you just have to have the Polish not a lot of teams have early season polish Brown has been on their feet for a long time here at the watsco center and a ton of red jerseys as well and shirts and behind the Rutgers fence they traveled well and a lot of fans here in the area also here tied at 61 five to shoot traveling violation yeah what youre alluding to is Clarks a good place to retire if youre from Jersey oh yeah you know you and I are both living in Jersey taxes were going to pay until retirement well make up for it when we end up down here someday but yeah no great a great show out from Rutgers took a little while for this crowd to get here for Miami but they got a fun product on the floor and a big shout out to the Amigo Grill and Company uh awesome was that that was fun that was good casual Steakhouse Francisco it was only us were the only one in the building it was awesome timeout Miami all right lets go strategy here for you Mr Chrisman tied up at 61 minute 36 to go you know it all depends what Rutgers doing defensively and maybe Rutgers shows a little Zone and then they switch out to man if they get late in the clock but I think youve got to attack quickly you got to see if you can create advantage on the offensive end if you play your turn my turn meaning we just work it down and spend 30 seconds on a possession and take a bad shot and then you give it to ready he cant do that Miamis got to be attacked early Rutgers has to be patient you got to move the basketball you got to get it side to side if theres an opportunity for a dumping which it hasnt been there omir has been so good defensively but for Miami look to get into an action quickly whether that action is something like a flare screen or a restroom ball screen its as simple as that I also want to say Bentley Joseph has been a game changer for this Miami team right now this night because hes been the one hand on the basketball which has allowed Nigel pack and Isaiah Wong to play off the ball where where theyre actually much stronger so Vince and Joseph may have a lot to do with this hes been stable and good yep hes the first off the bench we talked to him before the game he said he likes that role he understands it and hes been a huge part of this group right now the sophomore out of Arlington Massachusetts and the big part here is sideline out about to get to see what the defense is doing makes it much easier to attack Amir and nor Chad omear puts Miami in front by two a minute 15 to play Connell is checked by Bensley Joseph and a timeout Rutgers Steve pikel calls it with a minute and seven seconds remaining in this contest so this is where Rutgers has to have to be patient right youre gonna look to attack if you have it but the first thing you have to do is create space part of the reason why theyve turned the basketball over the last few possession is they havent had room to work they havent had space they havent had space to throw passes they havent had spaces to drive so if you can just clear space move it side to side be patient maybe look for some duckins they might be there depending again what Miami does defensively because theyve been going into Zone that staff right there that you saw Steve pikel head coach Carl Hobbs Brandon Knight TJ Thompson the assistance not only did they not lose anybody in the portal that staffs been together all seven years together in Piscataway New Jersey I think this is a big reason why this team is picking up steam trying to make it three consecutive NCAA tournaments in the early part of the season they got a 51 record and here they are down by two at Miami but the challenge is now again we go back to no Paul mulcahey you dont have that guy that can sit there read the defense see rotation see what defense theyre in for cried out loud youre gonna ask guys like cam Spencer to make a big play he struggled tonight Ken Spencer a guy who comes in averaging 17 points a game hes won a 10 from the field hes won a five from three right so hasnt really dotted can he hit a big shot I think Rutgers just has to move the basketball be stable and steady on this possession because the last few have not been good Rutgers is out of timeouts as you see Miamis got one remaining possession arrow Music favoring Miami if we get a jump now one of the things that we havent seen much of is any sort of like with with omir playing on top I would love to run somebody along the Baseline and try to take him out and allow Cliff omury to duck in if hes gonna sit high oh Lord should be out of the game position if somebody got cuts across that Baseline and takes a beer out and more hes over the foul line with Hyatt the balls in the hands of McConnell Amore sets the screen heres Spencer on the drive on the kick Hyatt fakes on the three goes right to the hole and misses rebound by Miller 50 seconds remain in the contest Miami ball twopoint lead yeah Miami really dodged one there Great Seal by omori to give Andre Hyatt a wide open layup Im not sure what happened we just got careless and Keith sometimes you get too cute just power up jump stop power up Nigel pack that that huge three earlier dagger time here he goes again Applause foreign Applause by long and its out of bounds Rutgers ball and how about Nigel pack on a night where hes three for 12 two of those three look this is the biggest thing you cannot leave a man isolated on the top of the key when you get a guy like Nigel pack dribbling hes just gaining Rhythm and please believe that shots probably going in inside is mag and it goes off the rim and its rebounded by Miller and a foulis called with 81 seconds remaining how about the fight for Miami they havent figured out who theyre going to be yet and its going to take some time but theyve had answers in this game Rutgers has given away some opportunities in terms of some buddies here at The Rim I think the biggest one too Rutgers has just been careless with the basketball when youre careless with the basketball you dont finish strong you dont capitalize on opportunities thats been the problem down the stretch two missed layups right there for the Scarlet Knights and with just 81 seconds remaining Miami to inbound with a fivepoint lead and you have said it how about Nigel pack well he had an impact the game in some way shape or form he made a big three and that was huge so he hits a three now he feels like hes at least hot or on again and you allow him to Rhythm dribble into a shot thats just too easy well thats all it takes is one youre absolutely right he started over eight thats not gonna rattle him right hes just gonna shoot hes open hes gonna put it up in that situation at the top of the key look if I ever get stuck on on a good shooter whos got room to drive Im going to turn around and say be ready to help because theres no way Im going to let him walk into a shot with rhythm off the bounce so I said before the shot went up I said dagger time like Ive been there before yeah thats an in Rhythm shot and that becomes a 60 70 make shot well you called it hurricanes seven and one in the ACC Big Ten challenge over the last eight seasons trying to go to eight and one and what a job down the stretch here in this one and I mentioned Benji Joseph played 25 minutes today no turnovers Applause Joseph makes it 6861s a sixpoint sensor made in McConnell nag for three not gonna be enough Miamis coming back from an 11th Point deficit to beat Rutgers by seven tonight here at home to improve to seven and one on the season give Miami all the credit in the world in terms of their fight down low omir was terrific I cant say enough about what a weird did in this game but Isaiah Wong was terrific Nigel pack stuck with it he hit the big shots
