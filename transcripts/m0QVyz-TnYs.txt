game already this season yeah cine Ninjas the transfer from West Virginia University really long great at The Rim but the thing thats impressed me the most about him on film is his skill level for a guy with that type of length and size hes pretty skilled its about ready to go here and about the weakest tip off youve ever seen what a buzz kill about as nice as the weather outside today well youre right nice to be indoors this evening uh cold and rainy day here in midnovember in South Carolina now the Tigers will get us underway Chase Hunter coming in Gotta Love what Chase Hunters bringing to the table at the point Applause yeah Chase is off to a great start this season hes been really consistent for the Tigers theyre going to need him to be able to continue to do that nice lob middle Brooks finds Brevin Galloway the grad transfer and were underway Tigers score first here come the Spartans this what that starting five looks like and this is what we talked about theyve got some link theyve got some scoring ability in Jai at the five today as they finish right there Jordan Gainey knocks it in so Jordan Gainey the reigning Big South freshman of the year last year off to a great start already this season gets the Spartans on the board no changes to the Tigers and theyre starting five how about Chase Hunter to the basket hes been so strong when hes gotten to the rim this year finished really well getting downhill great creator for those post players as well Applause States got scores gaining preseason First Team all big South jumper for three short Trey broadnax tried to get into the actors him and away for the Tigers so a lot of set plays from the upstate tonight and so weve already seen two already were going to see a lot of inside out type of offensive actions a lot of set plays for Dave Dickerson and the Spartans body controlled there by middle Brooks to avoid the charge Hunter nice kick Tyson cant buy the three and down with the board the Spartans thats Kadarius Smith Music broadnax picks his dribble up Tigers up a bucket here you see the Spartans patient offensively they want to get themselves a good shot the deflection by middle Brooks the Spartans late in the clock now in and out no good a onehand rebound by Ben Tigers playing Five on four at the moment Music great initial possession by the Tigers defensively Reverend Galloway Off the Mark Galloway unafraid to pull a quick trigger JD thats something youll see often with him yeah having the opportunity to coach Brevin Galloway for four years at the College of Charleston there has not been a shot that Mr Galloway has not liked three no good off the back iron Floyd redo Jr Applause Galloway pushing the tempo Hemingway wanted that from the moment he crossed half court and missed it teams are shooting at about as well as uh we said the weather is so far outside quote teams are getting good looks just hadnt gone down yet you know Upstate done a really good job shooting three at over 40 percent allowing about 27 from three so far this season I think a big part of that for the Spartans is they try to take really good shots coach Dickerson talked about that being something they take a lot of pride in wide open triple knocked down by Hunter good start for Chase hes got five great driving kick by the Tigers always want to create one for your teammate and they were able to do that right there Applause Spartans havent given a lot 27 actually 24 and a half percent theyve allowed from downtown the first two games against Brevard and Duke heres Jordan Gainey two long steps and hell head to the line first foul of the night whistled against Alex Hemingway Applause Music heres another look at the kick by Hemingway beautiful feed great pass put it right on location made it easy for Chase Hunter to catch and shoot good offense by the Tigers gaining two for two from the line this year Spartan was 15 attempts a game they make two thirds and Dave Dickerson going right to his bench Amir langleys gonna come on he started one game down low plays about 15 minutes a night mare is a transfer from Western Carolina University got the start at Duke on Friday big physical strong guy at The Rim and now here comes Justin Bailey The Freshman from just down the road at Blue Ridge High School averaging 125 points per game the lefthanders off to a great start for the Spartans this season yeah we highlighted two guys not in the lineup in our open but you see how important they are to their teams particularly on the offensive end Galloway down the lane beautiful feed for Middlebrooks and he will get a chance to convert at the line foul whistled against Langleys first defensive possession the Western Carolina transfer picks up his first so you talked about both teams offensively early and uh both teams are trying to find their Rhythm you know USC upstates had some really key injuries so far this season theyre trying to figure out how to fill those roles and Justin Baileys going to be a big part of that and then for the Tigers you know so much of it is going to be who can provide a punch off the bench coach Brownell going with Dylan Hunter here early in the game today I think hes a freshman that they have to find a way to help get in rhythm Music thatll bump his brother Chase off the ball with him in the game second free throw good by Middlebrooks tigers have doubled up the Spartans here early broadmax finds bayley Bailey quite a spark plug off the bench relocates and gets the feet in the corner 10 on the shot clock again Bailey nice step back the Lefty missed it strong so the Spartans are in no hurry right now theyre okay letting it get late in the shot clock and obviously coach Brownell is excited to see the Tigers defending so well throughout the clock right now Galloway puts it on the deck gets in the lane and draws the foul and he will go to the foul line when we come back to Little John Coliseum in just 51 in his career including a perfect 30 record on the sidelines for Clemson absolutely uh its a great thing that he got to do this on his birthday talking to him yesterday morning last thing I told him before we got off the phone was I wanted to be the first one to wish him a happy birthday but I know he wants nothing more than to see his team play well today yeah both these teams coming off losses that that one on Friday for Clemson and particularly crushing a game that they could have easily won in Colombia you lose in the final moments of the game but turn around jumper to South Carolina so far so good to start for Clemson as Galloway hits the two free throws and the Tigers find themselves up six yeah the Tigers got off to a great start offensively Friday night you know they were able to find some Rhythm but then turnovers late in the first half stalled the offense beautiful feed there in the Finish By langleys great execution coming out of the timeout by uh Dave Dickerson and his team Ian shefflin in the game and PJ Hall first touch for PJ blocked on the way up first and missed the rebound and I love the battle between Hall and whoever ends up at the five langlas are in Jai for USC Upstate yeah coach Dickerson talked about that that position for them would really be by committee and so well see a lot of guys match up with the tiger big man tonight Janey misses his first threepoint attempt you dont see him Miss many no the Spartans have gotten really good looks so far Galloway rejected on his way down the lane Applause thats Kadarius Smith and back the other way they go no good again and a foul whistled against the Spartans underneath as shefflin hits the deck foul called against Langleys thats his second so now Dave Dickerson with a choice to make and he will bring Floyd redo Jr back in so the Spartans are gonna go a little bit smaller right here itll be interesting to see how the tigers are going to match up right there whenever uh who PJs gonna guard and who Ian will guard Dylan Hunter the freshman at the point Josh Beadle in the lineup as well sitting in the right corner right now for the Tigers theres Hunter down the lane somehow got the ball to the rim fouled on the way up and thats a Fallon Rideau I think one of the best things that the Tigers have done early in the season have been Chase Hunter and Brevin Galloway attacking the basket on the dribble uh Brevin Galloway obviously a fantastic shooter Chase is a very capable shooter as well but theyve done a great job of attacking Closeouts getting downhill being able to get to the freethrow line but also creating for their post players some easy shots with some dump Downs nine different players for Dave Dickerson averaging double digits in minutes hes had to go deep into his bench here already without trouble has not just laying lays but Rideau also with two fouls and so much of that for Coach Dickerson and the Spartans has been because of the early season injuries that theyve had four guys that theyre without and those that happened in just the last couple of weeks so theyre still trying to figure out that rotation um and as they start to get some guys back itll make them better in the long run Music Tigers up five now this is broadmax beetles on him a really good on ball Defender so Trey broadnax and Josh Beadle two guys that know each other well played in the same AAU program Trey broadnecks has great size from C over defenders terrific pass to find upstate native Jordan Sarat in the corner for three Jordan Sarat one of several Dorman High products in the game today including the one that just made that pass a little too high for Chase Hunter you know thats something to follow here we see this three from Sarat a lot of Dorman on the floor today a lot of guys know each other very well very very well theres a lot of South Carolina guys on the floor and even though trade broadnax is from Savannah Georgia he played for a South Carolina AAU program so these guys are very familiar with each other Applause Spartans can tie with a two take the lead with a three again they dont mind triples coming down the left side a lob a little bit strong good rotations defensively for the Tigers forced to rad into a tough spot yeah you can tell the Spartans are going to make the Tigers defend late into the shot climb and uh youve seen some great discipline even right there that lane Line Drive Tigers were able to stay home you call that stunt and stay you know you want that guy to feel like youre coming as he drives it Lane line with his left hand but then ultimately make him have to make a play over a Defender and turned into a turnover thank you shuffling looking for Hunter Tyson and a foul whistle and its going to be called against the Spartans thats the rat that gets called for the hold so fouls Palling him quickly here JD and Dave Dickerson didnt like the call no they are and the Tigers have made a really conscious effort early in the game to try to post up the Spartans Music Hunter looking for Tyson across skip pass fetal in the corner cant knock it down Beatles still looking for his first points of the season and now a foul on the rebound and thats going to go against the Spartans as well and thats the third player with two fouls as sarad picks it up one more look at this up under the rim so interesting battle right there underneath the basket Jordan sarad a true freshman from Dorman High School Hunter Tyson obviously a sixth year guy for the Tigers theyve been really conscious right now coach Brunell and the staff to try to go inside to whichever one of those Ford matchups that they like the best and you see Hunter right there on the offensive glass lid on the basket right now for Clemson havent made a basket in over four minutes and thats ultimately what cost him on Friday night he got off to a great start in the first eight minutes hit a low in the middle of the half bangkoks took advantage and they never could really overcome that Dylan Hunter overcomes that four plus minute drown with a nice running bank shot Music I love Dylan Hunter you know I think hes got to be a guy that can step up and help the Tigers offensively well he just got his clock cleaned on a screen but the three too strong by Gainey Here Comes Chase Hunter down the floor crossover this is where he is and his element and fit finds PJ hall for the slam its been one of the best things that the tiger guards have done this year driving the ball playing off of two feet finding their bigs for easy shots at The Rim broadnax to the wing under Tyson defending the drive of Smith long athlete from Nation Ford High School and other South Carolinians thank you Justin Bailey driving goes up into Hall and couldnt get it to go Spartans is three for 13 right now PJ Hall doing a great job staying vertical at The Rim back to home Music Hunter Tyson in the lane missed it couldnt give himself a third chance Applause broadnax nice slip and then the errand pass by enjoy 11 15 to go and that leads us to a Timeout on the floor now before we started today a moment of silence here at Clemson due to a tragic situation that occurred this week in Charlottesville Virginia Powell with you all right JD lets put your coach hat on for a second what are you saying in these huddles to try to get guys to knock down some of the looks that theyre getting right now well both teams have got good dribble penetration you know and theyve gotten open shots uh you just got to keep telling them that those shots are going to go in trust your process all those simple things that as coaches we always talk about you always got to believe the next ones going in Tigers five makes 13 shots so far three for 13 and now the Spartans with a little pressure trying to crank things up a bit and Coach Dickerson has done this all the way back to when he was an assistant at the University of Maryland for Gary Williams he loves to bring a little bit of pressure out of the timeout how about Alex Hemingway down the lane with a soft Lefty finish hes a guy the Tigers really need to step up and help them in the scoring column moving forward only two points uh three points this past Friday night hey whistle foul and Dylan Hunter check out this play by Hemingway yeah absolutely you always talk about if somebodys going to pressure you you have to make them pay for doing that and so great pass ahead by Chase Alex is able to get in the lane terrific finish Dylan Hunter picks up his first Tigers will be in the bonus throughout the first half and quote just to finish that point on Hemingway for just a minute you know he led the Tigers in scoring on their trip this summer to France they need step up and continue to try to help them as we move forward as the schedules only going to get harder PJ Hall and thats the second time into possession that Justin Bailey sprawled out and PJ Hall whistle for the charge right there and again you said it those guys are teammates you know he understands exactly what PJs trying to do when he puts it on the floor like this no he absolutely does and uh you know Curtis wheeler guy in the upstate of South Carolina that runs that upward Stars program we talked about all those guys that are on the court Ive been in the gym many times to see all these guys playing together representing the state of South Carolina its great to see him on the court tonight together Applause Tigers continue to defend well another drought for the Spartans poked Away by Galloway and now Hemingway with no numbers will walk it across Music Revan Galloway finds Hall power dribble Stripped Away once again Bailey getting his hands dirty and then Hemingway with the turnover has a careless pass there Alex up the floor rejected but a goaltending call honestly I thought for a moment JD injai might just try to dunk it down himself right there he is a long athletic guy running the play down from behind you talk about how hes protected the rim so far this year for the Spartans you know we didnt have a lot of turnovers in the first eight minutes of the game weve seen uh several in this last four minutes in this segment enjoying native of Senegal 610 transferred from West Virginia really really talented long guy at The Rim he will be very good for the Spartans in the Big South Conference this season nice finish there on the midrange by Gainey great job of gaining being able to get the get downhill create some space for himself hes the first name on the Scout for every opponent for the Spartans so hes going to have to be able to create his own shot freshman of the year in the Big South last year him and way he misses the three Applause coming up on nine minutes to play here first half so you get a great fill for the Spartans and what coach Dickerson wants to do they got a missed shot right there but instead of pushing in transition walked it up he called a set play weve basically seen that every possession so far from the Spartans nice drive the block but a foul whistled on the drive theyre gonna get Chase Hunter for some contact thatll be chases first Music and the two shot foul coming up there so even right here in this isolation action that was a set play called by coach Dickerson as they walked it up the floor they were able to get Trey broadnecks isolated on the right side of the floor where he could come downhill Trey broadnecks is a big strong guy from Savannah Georgia his dad is Horace Bob Max head coach at Savannah State University but six foot four 185 pounds he is a big strong guy really talented guard for the Spartans Music Jordan Sarat back in now as ninja sits down Applause free throw for broadnax in and out Spartans have split four free throws to start Applause EJ Hall Applause Music pass and screen for Hunter not much you can do about that great seal by PJ in the post outstanding Post Feed by Chase Hunter DJ with four points we talked about his ferocious rehab process doctor said hed play in December but Brad Brownell said he circled the South Carolina game all along and now an illegal screen called against the rat thats his third foul so coach Dickerson running out of options look at this seal One More Time by Hall my favorite thing about this finish right here about PJ so much about tonight is going to be PJ coming off of the South Carolina game you know obviously was recovering from that injury worked really hard but tonight is even a little bit harder than Friday because hes got to get his legs back under him showed that explosiveness right there he looks pretty good Paul nice backdoor feed a couple extra passes Hemingway knocks it down beautiful basketball by the Tigers and the Spartans want to talk it over outstanding ball movement all created with a back door cut and a pass from PJ Hall able to find that in the corner one more pass to a teammate when they won a national championship as an assistant for Gary Williams the South Carolina native loves the University of Maryland no question about that I love everything about that as we get an offensive foul here Val called against broadnax as Hunter hit the deck he averaged 44 points a game that season and just casually dropped 129 in 39 minutes in the biggest game for his team Major upset Victory I mean thats thats a little Moxie right there saving the best for right there at the end of the year absolutely really important 81 game in the ACC tournament to step up like that for your team traveling called against Middlebrooks you mentioned in the turnovers starting to pile up a little bit we had a cleanly played first few minutes now six for the Spartans and four for the Tigers and really the issue for USC Upstate is they dont have any points off the first three turnovers Clemsons got nine off the six giveaways for Upstate yeah and the Spartans have got some really good looks offensively they just havent gone down now theyve started to turn it over a little bit and the Tigers have turned that into offense theres a look at your points off turnovers Lefty three for Bailey freshman Jordan Bailey Justin Bailey excuse me 125 points per game they need him to step up and right when they need it he hits that big three Applause foreign middle Brooks pitched back to Hunter hes tried to penetrate several times today two for two from the floor six points Galloway will get downhill and who is this on Yep theyre going to call the foul on Bailey so thats his first how about the shot from Bailey out of the wing great drive and find by Jordan Gainey finds his teammate and then Brevin Galloway continues to use this strength to get downhill youre talking about a sixyear senior right there in Brevin Galloway going against a true freshman able to use his upper body strength to get downhill get to the freethrow line for Evan a few weeks ago arent you tired of school I mean I was tired way before year six man come on and he and you know what I didnt like how last season ended I was hurt and he said when I found out I had a chance to finish my career the way I wanted I had to take it and especially the opportunity here close to home kid from Anderson yeah having coached into the College of Charleston seen him since he was in high school at Seneca and just his growth and his maturity really really proud of what hes done both on and off the basketball court Applause Music across the looks it down hes got a gamehigh eight so theyre starting to move Gainey around off a lot of screening actions right there they brought him off of a baseline pin down he was able to curl it to his strong right hand and get to the rim and finish hunter gets his pocket picked broadnax eyes up the floor no look pass beautiful and Smith the finish and now Clemson wants a timeout as Brad Brownell not happy with his team has four quickies for the Spartans there JD so much of it is a game of runs and so the Spartans win that segment seven to two theyre right back in the game the lead a little bit but four straight buckets for the Spartans here they started this game a little bit slow offensively but theyve seemed to find that Rhythm you were talking about a few minutes ago yeah I think theyve started to settle down just a little bit you know theyre coming off the Duke game on Friday night where they never really uh got sped up or looked at a place it really is more a thing of Dukes length forcing 23 turnovers here theyve been able to execute they just hadnt been able to make shots but theyve settled down in the last couple of minutes and have gotten some good looks Hunter stopped at the elbow Music Bailey not gonna let Galloway have it Applause skip pass Hunter Hemingway in the corner cashes it in a beautiful crosscourt look PJ Hall gets up a little bit gimpy so one of the first things that you notice coming out of that timeout coach Brownell put him right back in the game but middle Brooks is back up off the bench hes going to get PJ here in just a second again this is Bailey you see his creativity on display here in the first half inside deep two knocks it down I love that kids game its the first thing that I noticed on film watching him you know how well he shot free throws hes shooting 75 percent hes nine of 12 from the free throw line and there you even see him face up and knock down that jumper Music nice curl by Galloway banks at home Spartans bench wanted a foul bear on the pushoff and Dave Dickerson is upset there again I think hes upset with the defense more than anything else well theres been two physical plays on each end of the floor right there uh PJ on one end and then Brevin on the other neither one was called the officials are letting them play Music lob injai gonna go to the line Applause the insertion of enjoy in the starting lineup here you see the skip pass great find by Chase Hunter Alex Hemingway hits his second one of the game and then this faceup jumper right there from nji thats impressive a guy with that type of size and lymph his ability to protect the rim make that faceup jumper and then that pick and roll in the last possession right there between him and broadnax outstanding pass by Trey broadmax gets injot to the free throw line ninja just two for seven in the first two games of the season coming in I guarantee you the 18foot square up faceup jumper was not on the Scout no that wasnt on the video edit that the Clemson staff showed yesterday for sure and thats the thing about preparing for games like this you know the Clemson staff he loses South Carolina on Friday night three days ago and so now theyve just been pouring into this film trying to get these guys ready to play because I can promise you dick bender and staff at Clemson Billy Donlon they know how good this Upstate team is some reinforcements coming in both ways Thomas Shada in for the first time for USC Upstate hes digging down on Hunter and boy they came together Jordan Gainey locked up with Hunter there as he stumbled backwards and now like cooler heads will prevail no we said it just a second ago this game has gotten a little bit physical this is a confident Upstate team they take a lot of pride in being able to pressure the basketball they want to be physical with you and youre seeing that on display right now gaining a very good player off to a bit of a slow start this season has three for six today but over two from downtown hes four for 11 a little bit of a volume shooter hes not been able to get more than maybe one or two clean looks so far today so Jordan Gainey is the son of Justin Gainey University of Tennessee basketball assistant long time college coach he played at NC State had a chance to visit with him last night and talk about his son hes so proud of what hes done but I even asked his dad the question is there any pressure to follow up what he did last year because you look at his stats as a freshman those are really really impressive those are going to be hard to talk because now everybody knows who you are going into every game hes going to be the first guy that they talk about in a scouting report Danny just an unbelievable Applause Revelation for this team last year as they won 10 League games first time in the upstate history winning team conference games in the Big South Conference and now youre seeing that seeing them start to get in a little bit of a flow now Danny looked at his bench like now Im feeling good hes got 11 no hes feeling more comfortable now Duke didnt give him a lot of space on Friday night the tigers are trying to be right there on every shot but hes a talented guy on her right to the rim and theyre going to count it 3423 tigers by 11 after the goal 10 well step aside and take a break well complete the first half after course stats riveting analysis from JD Powell well give a little bio for Clemsons newest signee that happened just recently and then of course well give you some highlights from here in the first half some things just stand out to you so far JD as we enter the home stretch of half number one as both teams have taken a little bit better care of the ball theyve gotten some easier shots the biggest thing is to look at the shooting percentages you know uh Clemson is up about 22 percent from where they were about eight minutes ago the Spartans have settled in as well so both teams are finding an offensive Rhythm now if you ever seen a game a lot coming from the foul line and points off turnovers Tigers plus five in that free throw Department broadmax has run the point pretty well for the Spartans here in the first half Applause in Jai little dribble handoff Applause Music Applause feed back out three on the way way off the mark from Smith Chelsea Wiggins checks in for the Tigers the really talented freshman Im sorry that was RJ Godfrey but uh you know one of the big things coach Brownell is going to talk about is just being able to trust him lost his man a little bit there defensively and he got loose and Josh Beadle lost the ball out of bounds there being a little bit out of control getting downhill sure you look out on the floor right now for the Tigers you see uh two freshmen you see a sophomore with two older guys but this is going to be an interesting three minutes right here who can win the last four minutes of the half is such a huge part Applause foul whistled against Godfrey there you see it physically Godfreys impressive son of Randall Godfrey longtime NFL linebacker but even for a freshman hes going to come out after this sure the North Gwinnett High School native obviously physically really strong coach Brownell loves his intensity and his intangibles particularly on the defensive side but being able to play without fouling thats good thats been a big part of Coach Browns message to RJ first free throw good kiberius Smith 68 255 well put together yeah hes a great story you know he from Fort Mill South Carolina signed to Upstate and hes a guy that has stuck around hes gotten better throughout his career I remember when he was a younger guy coming out of high school uh was a little bit thinner but its just continued to improve his game its gonna have a great senior year Applause Tigers lead cut to nine its been as many as 13 Spartans have not LED in the first half Chase Hunter nice pocket pass to shefflin Applause Tyson spins couldnt get the roll really good oneonone defense by kataria Smith right there was able to force the tigers into a tough pullup once again broadnax running the show Spartans content to play in the half court broadnax finds some room on the Baseline three on the way yes sir theres Bailey getting into the act just second three of the night all started with a ball screen action right there balnacks came off drove the Baseline was able to find his teammate in the corner for a wide open shot the Spartans have gotten good looks theyre starting to go down now Banks shot up and good Ian shefflin finds the glass Music be back up to eight correction thats Galloway who founded and Brevin continues to attack the rim well off the dribble floater blocked from behind there good defense by Galloway tigers with a chance to run go goodbye Hunter Applause enjoy another rebound thats five for him in the first half talking to the upstate staff before the game that was the biggest thing they talked about with cine enjoy they talked about his rebounding productivity in the minutes that he plays talked about just how productive he is in those minutes and how many he can get done in that small amount of time Spartans a chance to cut into this lead further Gainey going back to the line PJ Hall gonna get the final 93 seconds on the floor here Music Beetle picked up the foul that put the Spartans in the bonus Applause gaineys first is good and the other thing to take note of is Upstate has gotten into a better offensive Rhythm as theyve started making their free throws you know they shoot the ball well from the freethrow line but they were three of six to start the game theyve now made their last four in a row starting to get into a little bit of a rhythm Applause Gainey cooking now hes got 13 points in the first half hes got his team from 13 all the way back within six and has really good scores too Gainey continues to get to the freethrow line Hunter Tyson straight away nice ball Movement by the Tigers great job by the Spartans and a blocking foul called tried to draw the charge and Bailey couldnt get the whistle thats two fouls on Bailey so Brevin Galloway attacking the close out to his left Justin Bailey tries to cut him off thats about the fourth confrontation at The Rim or right there that uh Block charge call that Dave Dickerson hasnt gotten yet hes trying to get his staff to calm down theyre not too happy about it right now Galloways free throw up and good yeah the Tigers have gotten to the line of bunch here both teams eight of 11 from the line early its been a physical game very physical both into pain and on the perimeter see that in the 18 fouls called so far and dont look now Brevin Galloway with 12 points hes six of six from the charity strike Spartans foul issues continue that will be a factor in the second half no doubt about it Dylan Hunter the point right now finds his brother Chase Music floater from the foul line nope again good defending by the Spartans chance to go two for one if they wanted but they did not seem interested in getting that JD no the Spartans havent played very fast at all today theyve wanted to keep this thing slow try to get as many good shots as possible Gainey quick first step and hes going to go to the line well he teleported right past the defender that time and hes disappointed that that didnt go in you know thats a great look for him and so now coach Dickerson is going to try to get a defensive group on the floor to manage this last 23 seconds without fouling try to get some guys off the floor that might be in foul trouble meanwhile coach Brownell is going to bring Alex hemen way back try to get the best offensive group that he can on the floor for this last possession big right here quote so Jordan gain hes at the freethrow line he can cut it to six then it becomes can the Tigers come back down uh how are these last 23 seconds going to play out to finish the half and for the Spartans its really been about survival you talked about the Tigers were up by as many as 13 Spartans have been in foul trouble basically throughout the half theyre just trying to finish this thing well be out of here down six coach Dickerson will take it Tigers will hold for the last shot here good battle Brewing here in the first 20 minutes Applause Tyson kicks to the corner Chase Hunter rips the cord and thatll send us to halftime good play from Brad brownells Tigers there to close a half great find by Hunter Tyson the play was to go inside the PJ Hall and the postup didnt have it was able to find his teammate in the corner Chase Hunter knocks down to three and is able to push the lead in minutes and a half but theyve got to continue to attack the paint whether its off the dribble with Chase Hunter and Brevin Galloway are throwing it inside the PJ Hall and you see hes going to start the second half after not starting the game so here we go yep the nine starters that began things and PJ Hall out of the locker room Spartans Tigers LED for double digits for a little while but this has primarily been a single digit Advantage for Clemson throughout this game one nice Cut there and speaking of extra passes Smith going to work on Tyson and he throws it away that was great defense by Hunter Tyson that time it was and Kadarius Smith just caught himself in a bad spot right there on the Baseline he left his feet had nowhere to go with the ball Hunter Tyson no points in the first half but six rebounds and some good defense like that we have our first whistle and thats on injai now again we talked about how the fouls are piling up semi ninja the only one for the Spartans has played down low thats not in foul trouble at the moment but the first set of the second half for uh coach Brownell is a postup a high low look from Hunter Tyson trying to post up PJ results in a foul Galloway looking for an outlet Music the length of Smith defensively hes been a problem for Tyson not a problem on that move as he has cracked the code and hes got the first points for Clemson here in the second half sure and we talked about it at halftime for Hunter Tyson to not score in the first half and youre up nine thats really a good sign for Coach Brownell and the Tigers Applause Music Applause Chaney off the screen hanging and hitting how about this kid he was out of the locker room it felt like immediately sprinting out here to get a ball to get some more shots up he was ready to go and thats great use of his pivot foot right there to get a shot at The Rim outstanding Hemingway tried to feed it back to Hall and again Gainey knocks it away so Hunter Tyson is able to get downhill to his right hand able to turn the corner and then right here this is outstanding footwork by Jordan Gainey drives it to his left pivots back steps through able to finish Dannys showing that midrange game Applause Galloway back to the basket loses it five to shoot wide open layup that time he lost the ball and it helped him out I think cleared a little space it did Coach Dickerson is not going to be happy about these first two possessions uh for the Spartans to for the Tigers to be able to come out and get two layups like that thats not what hes looking for coming out of the locker room now that ones a careless turnover there Gainey with a little bump of the shoulder on his way by on the handoff and thats been a point of emphasis really since last year to try to clean that up it is you know those guys those bigs get put in such a tough position right there trying to keep play without their hands play without putting their body into that guy oh Hall with the cut to him Applause and Wilson not happy at all hell chat with the Spartans the Tigers in command early second half Music so much of the Tigers offense is predicated on those bigs being able to pass the ball from the top of the key so its a set play Brevin Galloway clears out right there allows PJ Hall to bring it to the left drops it off set play back door that was nice now you see all smiles on the Clemson side on the upstate side of things though you said Dave Dickerson with a very simple message for his team in that timeout yeah it was great to be able to listen in to coach Dickerson right there in his first question when his players sat down was how can we expect to win this game giving up three consecutive layups coming out of the locker room and so that tells me two things squawk it tells you what their expectation was coming into Clemson tonight they felt like they could win they know that they could and then the question was what is their standard right now defensively because clearly giving up those layups in a half court arent it Alex Hemingway by the way you saw that graphic 12 points five of seven from the floor most important to me three for three from twopoint range not something were used to seeing from him wild shot in the paint and then an open three for Bailey hes three for four for downtown how about the youngster from Blue Ridge High School cooking so much of it for Mr Bailey right now is being able to play off of his teammates hes getting really good looks because of the attention that Jordan Gainey gets and he continues to knock him down Tyson nice spin to the Baseline feed for Hall who flushes it Applause Tyson could have had him and lay up there but instead shares the ball thats the 10th assist of the game on 19 makes for the Tigers its one of the best things that the Tigers have done so far on this early season is that interior passing whether it be from a guard or from post to post because that one was from Hunter Tyson great driving kick right there by the Spartans finding Justin Gainey Im sorry uh finding uh the gallon of perimeter but then right there Hunter Tyson down low finds PJ for the easy dunk excuse me Applause this is Trey brodnax his first point of the game missed all three shots and both free throws in the first half theyd have four assists so a good job running the show third year sophomore transfer from Navy and a third year sophomore who spent a year at the Naval Academy in their prep school so really a fourth year in college my favorite thing about his game at Duke 29 minutes only two turnovers really good job taking care of the ball and Cameron Indoor Stadium on Friday night Kadarius Smith off the floor getting 102 for a moment Music PJ Hall going to work shot missed by Dylan Hunter Gainey where theyre gonna hedge on him I would imagine just about every possession of the second half and broadmax just took his eye off of it he did just got a little bit ahead of himself as Justin Bailey threw that back up to the top its a frustrating first three and a half minutes for the Spartans State theyve made shots so far in the second half sure just to turn the ball over yeah and then unable to get some stops you know they didnt get a stop until that last possession with the missed three but the Tigers continue to try to pound it inside this time PJ Hall in the high low action trying to find Hunter Tyson at The Rim thats good awareness there too because you had a switch you got a point guard in broadmax with Tyson on him an obvious postup situation there broadnecks picks up his second foul thats the third on the Spartans Lang lays back in by the way guarding PJ Hall Hunter the drive in the float no good PJ a strong rebound and gets it great job of wedging his Defender up underneath the basket and then being able to use his length to rebound and finish over the top all five Spartans on the floor right now I have two fouls so no real second half foul trouble nice defense by PJ Applause Music PJ Hall using this length creates that deflection another Spartan turnover Chase Hunter Applause the other way no numbers though all Gainey too strong oh wide open Bailey to the bucket so the Spartans havent attacked very much in transition they pitch it ahead redu finds his teammate Gainey running behind him Spartans are able to get an offensive rebound get an easy one at The Rim they havent gotten very many easy so far tonight nice kick by Dylan Hunter PJ Hall in and out and a foul whistled and again its going to be a foul on broadmax fouls continuing to pile up for the Spartans a little bit more aggressive sometimes and that was an aggressive shot right there they got into a ball screen switch he created some space got it off 20 points for him Music Hunter using that scream rejected here they come two on two Gainey puts it on the floor and missed he was between the dunk and the layup there and Clemson with a free possession the Dylan Hunter throws it away in a foul he was grabbed on the way by by redo Music great drive by Hunter Tyson great body control right there to finish the 68 guy making it look really easy floating through the lane how about this from Gainey oh its amazing how sometimes the hard ones can go in and then you get that shot right there at the rim Jordan Gainey wont miss many of those Dylan Hunter misses strong Tigers will be shooting free throws from now to the end less than seven minutes into the second half already in the bonus Music this is redo Music broadnax and a foul whistled against Ian shefflin hadnt seen Ian much today picks up his first foul we havent seen Ian and so much of it after the Citadel game played so well 22 points uh did not score in the game at South Carolina on Friday has not scored yet tonight I dont believe and so the Tigers need some production from that other post player coach Brownell is hoping that it could possibly be Ian Hunter Tyson both had double doubles against the Citadel theres a lob to space and shefflin able to pick it up three doe upset with himself you can tell hes trying to get it back Music Ian nice feet inside the twohanded flush the Tigers continue to go to that high low action and the Spartans havent been able to solve it yet tigers have 13 were up nine at the half and they have extended it broadnax nice defending by Tyson out of the corner drop down to help and still was able to get to his man 21 to shoot broadnax fouled on the drive so the Spartans get Ian schifflin in a ball screen switch broadnax sees it immediately tacks downhill able to draw the foul but the other thing twoqual right before this 12minute media timeout Coach Dave Dickerson takes Jordan Gainey off the floor allows him to get a breath so that he can catch it through the media timeout coach Dickerson wants that Under 12 to get here quickly though so he can put it back in and itll send broadnecks to the line Brad Brownell saying that was on the floor hes not going to win that argument beetle in as Dylan Hunter checks out points for Dylan foreign Max knocks down both free throws 8746 as were under 12 minutes to play here in Clemson he and Chef win nice feed to Hunter thats as easy as it gets right there Ive been really impressed with the Tigers ability to execute coming off of free throws and dead balls so far this season theyve gotten some really good looks at The Rim evidence there again with that layup Tigers Roots heading well defensively on the right side broad knacks floater over him and way how about that really tough shot Tigers stayed home were able to use their length but broadmax sometimes good offense is just better than good defensive Flynn looking to enter it in Music beetle finds Tyson on the right side Chef Flynn looking to go oh beautiful kick to Hemingway yes sir Alex Hemingway continues to play well for the Tigers today thats his third made three really going to help his confidence moving forward largest lead of the game so far 14 the second time the Tigers have had it sure and I go back to coach Dickerson subbing Jordan Gainey out that media timeout waited just a little bit longer than coach Dickerson wanted to to get here Langley gets a chance at a threepoint play when we come back after a Timeout on the floor Tigers up a dozen because the plays like this scoring but hes been a good teammate as well today youll see all the different ways hes gotten involved JD absolutely the back door pass is what really makes him such a special player you know his ability to pass it from the top of the key he has great length at The Rim hes an outstanding finisher but he can stretch the floor the accs both to improved player last year obviously coming back from injury but hes off to a great start played well Friday night against the Gamecocks and uh and looks good today I was worried about it you know how does he come back after that physical game at the University of South Carolina Friday night played 22 minutes but hes off to a great start tonight with 10 points hes played 17 minutes and theyre not going to let him go full board still probably in that 20 to 25 minute range that we as weve had conversations but you know the doctors originally told him coming back from the injury that December is probably best case scenario coaches have said he himself circled the South Carolina game and wanted to get back for that and give him a lot of credit for attacking his rehab with that in mind how about Ian shefflin with authority great job being aggressive on the glass by Ian shefflin the Tigers need him to step up and be able to provide some extra punch down there Tyson to Beetle and a timeout for upstate Dave Dickerson not pleased at all with how his team came out of the timeout some hustle from Clemson leading directly to offense sure the Tigers find Two Shots right there at the rim one an offensive rebound Ian schifflin on the putback right here coming in crashing the glass and then the second one just turning a turnover into offense tigers have done a good job of that so far this year Hunter Tyson gets it out on the break finds Josh Beadle running two layups at the rim and thats really been the story of the second half so far the Spartans have not been able to stop the Tigers in the paint Thats now 40 points in the paint its the largest lead for Clemson today 6650 we talked about during the break JD USC upstates got to make a choice here because they they have not been able to defend without fouling inside theyre giving up points in the paint they got to kind of pick their poison a little bit and hope Clemson knocks down some shots so they got to change they cant turn the ball over we know that and and that especially in a full court situation just a careless way to lose the ball and give up three points on the other end absolutely it was a pretty good defensive possession even the one before and now again shuffling comes in makes a great hustle play but then they turn it over that leads to a live ball turnover and a layup theres no defense for that broadmax nice curl by Gainey Applause Music Lang Lang trying to make a move on sheplin with a left hand he missed it Galloway clears the board and Amir Langley is going to be aggressive down there watching him on film this week he wants to try to score particularly over that right shoulder or lefthanded post player pretty good move just couldnt get the shot to go down Applause Chef Flynn again a skip pass Hunter for three Applause thats the second pass in the second half that Ian shefflin has found a shooter on the perimeter really good offense right there by the Tigers Gainey wide open hes not going to miss those 22 points for the sophomore Gainey Music Applause and Gainey knocks the ball away from beetle finds a teammate up the floor nice Up and Under move by Bailey and four quickies for the Spartans right back in it Jordan Gainey showing some defensive presence right there knocking the ball away from Josh Beadle leads to the transition basket for the Spartans which they have not gotten many of Music Chase Hunter who he wanted it Music Galloway skip all the way to the corner rebound cleared by Surat and I think Brevin Galloway thought Chase Hunter was going to shoot it he wasnt quite shot ready kind of fumbled that catch threw him off rhythm Applause Gainey thought about it hes got a smile on his face he wants the ball back nice speed on the Block Applause Langley kicks it back out fade in the lane got the roll broadnax has got eight second time weve seen Spartan guards get into the lane in the second half use that pivot foot really well to create an angle to be able to score really well done by Trey broadmax there Applause Galloway with the right hand it just plays like a guy whos been in college basketball a million years doesnt he his body is in great shape quote its the best that Ive seen in three years I love to see Galloway attack with you and JD you made a good observation both these teams shooting very well in the second half but it feels like the shots that Clemsons getting are a little bit easier and theyre converting them into just a slightly better rate one of the biggest stats that I love to study Quark when I was an assistant coach was what are we giving up from two right now because Im a big believer whoever can score it at The Rim whoever gets the most layups is probably going to win you look at the Tigers in the second half theyve been able to do that theyre 1115 from two when you can get to the pain and get those easies those kick out threes become so much easier whenever youre getting those inside outlooks Tigers 6 of 17 from three but theyve scored it primarily in the pain named Hunter Tyson gets the rebound needs some help tigers are going to make it a three or four point possession after Galloway splits the pair Chase Hunter cant shed his Defender good job by Bailey to flank him pass goes out of bounds with three to shoot the Tigers will inbound and we continue to see that high low look Hunter Tyson posted up the Freshman Jordans rat he got some over the top help that time from Trey broadnecks though Galloways got to put it up and a shot clock violation as shefflin went up high couldnt tap it in time that was a tough catchandshoe situation for Galloway good defense out of the timeout by the Spartans but you know what over Brevin Galloways career watching him at the College of Charleston and Boston College hes one of the best tough shot makers late in the shot clock that I ever had an opportunity to coach I was almost surprised it didnt go in broadnax what a pass in the kick out no good on the three thats Sarat he made his only one in the first half Music Hunter Tyson mid post oh what a move and finish for Hunter early transition offense Hunter Tyson able to get to the rim posts up Trey broadnecks the tigers are able to get another Basket in the paint Tyson did not score in the first half hes got eight so far in the second Music Smith couldnt get it up over shefflin say what shefflins given some good possessions a defense with long arms forcing Spartans to come up a little bit short no I agree and the other part is his offense you know I think that coach Brunell feels like hes got to be that second post player that can step up and give the Tigers a scoring punch in the paint strong rebound grab by Smith Spartans want to push here Music broad Max runs right through Chase Hunter and I think he knew he was sliding his feet there blocking foul is his third Music great early postup right here by Hunter Tyson Tigers recognize the matchup right there in the paint Hunter Tyson takes his time able to get to a spot and scored at The Rim but Quark the other thing that I would tell you too is that I think that we came out of that under eight media timeout and you can start to see the physicality of the game wearing on both teams thats a bunch of fouls on both sides theres been a bunch of really physical plays at The Rim youre starting to see that just a little bit more aware on those guys from both teams both teams in the bonus now one and one Gainey Hemingway all over him Janey gets inside and he just flings it up there and it goes out of bounds off the tigers that is a free possession coming for the Spartans thats the first time weve seen Gainey really Force One yeah trying to get to a spot you know trying to use that shot fake and stepped through Tigers didnt go for it but they get an extra possession right there on the uh missed box out fixed defensive rebound by the Tigers Danny a kick out well get it back Applause Music Smith sarad drives good defense by Hemingway three on the clock nice split there broad nags gets the roll really good defensive possession right there by the Tigers the Spartans got into a switch you can hear coach Brownell yelling to him to stay on the perimeter with Gainey but uh Spartans are able to find one late in the shot clock Tyson a quick three Off the Mark Music if Upstate can answer here with a bucket Music its a rat Music swing around broadmax to the rim and hes fouled on the way by Dylan Hunter really smart basketball player right there by Trey broadnax I can promise you he knows that theyre one foul away from the bonus he catches it on a reversal anytime a big is running into a ball screen its a great time to refuse that ball screen and drive it back to the Baseline in the NBA and international they talk about they want to refuse as many as 80 percent of the ball screens Trey broadnax able to do it right there hes going to get to the free throw line because of it chance to get it to 12 points is that just because the defense relaxes a little bit you feel like you can get to that outside shoulder I think most of that becomes you know we have a plan when they use it you know we want to force guys into a ball screen when he can refuse it we dont have as much help to the other side Applause Chase Hunter cross attend second line for Clemson Music DJ Hall sets up Hemingway yep great job by PJ Hall creating that shot for his teammate interesting to see PJ gets back in the game right there it immediately leads to a Clemson basket for a teammate Music three and hes found the going tough the last few minutes now hes got it in a scoring position Applause Bailey second leading scorer on the team and tried to find Gainey and the ball goes out of bounds its a great cut Jordan Gainey does a great job of moving without the basketball now hes a little bit worn down right now were late into the game hes driven the ball multiple times but Ive been impressed with his ability to play without the basketball you know first half they were bringing him off of those Baseline curl actions it was able to help him get into a rhythm getting some free throws and even right there you know that play hes going to make that play most of the time off of that back cut uh pass to the rim he just saw PJ coming out of the corner of his eye and couldnt finish it were doing Langley back in Applause drive and he lost the handle Galloway off the turnover tigers good and Retreat defensively and then they left broadnecks alone for a jumper and an official timeout Applause and thatll take us to immediate timeout under four to play tigers in command Music done it all season you know hes averaging 818 points per game early in the year obviously but he just continues to create for teammates thats probably been the thing that has impressed me the most about what Chase Hunter has done this season so much of the offense that especially Ian shefflin has gotten even PJ Hall some of the other guys has been because of offense created by Chase Hunter when hes gotten into the paint and found somebody else one step we didnt throw up there three of five from threepoint range and if hes giving you that in addition to what he can do driving and creating that midrange game its a complete player if he can round that out no hes off to a great start you know one of the most improved guys in the ACC so far in the early part of the season if hes playing with a lot of confidence my favorite thing is the pace that he plays with it absolutely absolutely uh now four of six from three tonight uh Chase Hunter is off to a great start this season and even 20 for Hunter oh a foul called against Galloway there as he runs right through Bailey on the cut I wondered if coach Dickerson might Gainey back in the game heres the last shot by Hunter well get back to that look at that smooth stroke sure and so much of that one right there you know thats a contested three you know Brevin Galloway drives it to his left he finds Chase but you can tell in that shot right there he feels really confident theres no hesitation in that his eyes are on the basket immediately never any doubt about whether or not he was going to shoot that basketball and we wondered if he might put Gainey back in after the media timeout he gave him an extra 37 seconds of game time to rest and now hes back on the floor two free throws up and good for Bailey freshman from Blue Ridge High School here in the area got 15 hes a leading scorer for this team per game coming in first two against Brevard and Duke sure and Coach Dickerson has talked about you know with the injuries that Upstate has had so far this year theyre going to need to get some guys to step up by committee and Justin Gainey is uh right there at the front of that group right now Hunter loses it PJ Hall nice hesitation move in the finish for the left that is a high high level finish right there qualk he took it to his left faked back to the other shoulder and then to go to that lefthanded jump hook thats really really nice PJ is quickly getting back into form after that injury broadmax nice dump down and the Finish Langley delivers Trey broadnecks continues to be really good in the pick and roll thats about the third time that hes been able to find that big uh with his eyes up guy at The Rim really good job by Trey 12 points five assists for him today and the Spartans have played well you know its 80 to 64 uh I know it feels like its a little bit further away than what it is coach Dickerson and the staff will go back and watch this film tonight and theyre going to leave Clemson disappointed you know they felt like they could come in here that this is a game that they could win I think you have to give Clemson a lot of credit for their mental approach coming in after the game on Friday but coach Dickerson and the Spartans will return home theyll play Coastal Carolina on Friday before going out to the Air Force Academy early next week which is while a great trip and a beautiful place its a really hard trip so the Spartans have their best basketball in front of them theyll be able to take some really good things away from this tonight Hall misses the front end of a one and one that was Langleys fourth so again that early voucher for the Spartans you still got two minutes left here but theyve only got one with four theyve done a good job managing that nice Cut and the Lefty finished broadnax again Sparks do a great job in their cutting action playing off of some of those screens thats about the sixth or seventh time weve seen one of those guards come off of a curl be able to read it get to the rim and finish Tigers will take on Bellarmine coming up on Friday team has already knocked off Louisville in the ACC interesting matchup how about that feed from Hunter PJ missed the bunny really good Bellarmine team coming in here on Friday night they do an outstanding job of shooting the basketball Tigers will enjoy watching this film tonight coach Brownell will hopefully enjoy a couple of hours of his birthday and then theyll get right back to work dick Bender Sean Dixon uh Billy Donald the outstanding staff that they have over there they will go right back to work get ready for a schedule thats only going to continue to get harder after Bellarmine Loyola Maryland and then it really gets hard now Iowa and moving forward from there December is an incredibly hard month for the Tigers you didnt see there they have Loyola Chicago Im going to go ahead and say theyre the only team before January 1 that is playing both loyolas Loyola Maryland Lewis Chicago and of course theres Loyola mayor Mound as well but I mean you get two loyolas on the schedule thats one heck of a way to fill up your bingo card so I love what the Tigers have done by trying to schedule games on neutral site floors theyre going to do it in Greenville but theyre also going to do it in Atlanta and Atlanta the Georgia area has been such an important piece recruiting wise for the Tigers anytime they can go back to State Farm Arena in Atlanta and play coach brownells done it less than a minute left Tigers up a dozen DJ Hall blocking foul whistled backside Defender thats shayda who rotated over one more look at this PJ turning face Music yeah when you see that drive and finish right there um you know the trainers are theyre going to tell you the pjs not all the way back but hes pretty close you know its late in the game hes played 20 plus minutes drives that to his right thats an off balance finish off of two feet takes the contact I know hed like to step up here now and finish this with these two free throws this is a free throw there Applause hes now oh for two from the line thats uncharacteristic BJ coming in 78 for his career from the foul line and so much of that is just getting back into a rhythm you know and thats what these games right now are about played well at South Carolina came in and gave the Tigers an immediate impact Five Points uh early in the game in South Carolina his night is done tonight hes one day closer to being fully healthy and ready to go could be the last possession offensively for the Spartans Music Rod Max looking to get an angle on Hunter Chase puts his chest into her twice Shada nice back door cut for Gainey whos tied his career high now with 24 last possession of the game but the Spartans continue to move without the basketball really really impressive theyre going to be so many things that both of these teams will take from this film tonight that theyll be able to move forward from and build them were talking about the Spartans pick the Finish middle to the bottom of the Big South thats just Ill just say thats laughable theres no way that there are more than a couple of teams in the Big South got a chance to be better than this squad well when I spoke to coach Brownell yesterday morning I have not watched Upstate yet but coach brownout was quick to tell me how good they were on film and when I watched those two games that theyve played against Duke and Brevard theyre good theres not seven teams better than them in the Big South right now theyre going to have a really good season Tigers win it 8170 here tonight you see the mutual respect Brad Brownell and Dave Dickerson have for one another its a good battle tonight JD on the uh on the one hand you had USC Upstate coming in here playing well but the Tigers finish on top so many good things that the Tigers will take away from this coming off of that disappointing loss on Friday night against South Carolina they responded played well theyll get ready for a good Bellarmine team on Friday for JD Powell our staff here in Clemson Im William clarkenbush thanks for joining us tonight inside Little John Coliseum again the Tigers get back in the win column with an 8170 victory over the USC Upstate Spartans well see you Friday as the Tigers take on Bellaman right here on acc Network extra
