excited about a chance to to leave the ship I think lead back to just one for Miami after the triple was good by Burger Applause Isaiah Wong will pull up and deep 23 feet out rattled around the rim and bounced out into the hands of CJ Fulton I think Coachella might have liked a little more ball movement before that shot right there Bolton a really good point guarding quarterback for this leopard

the Miami Hurricanes and Jim larenega think he could be a superstar for this team absolutely thats one of the first things I noticed when I stepped out here was how different his body is right now hes really really in great shape Rivera works on the Baseline Fulton will fire away for three and hit this teams going to be tough theyre going to want to they like to shoot the threes and theyre going to square up and go ahead and let them fly deep downtown from the near side wing for CJ Fulton hes got five its 11 10 Miami with 13 and a half to play here in the first half Jordan Miller Works Baseline

very physical rebound by omir see his talent inside bar side three the right wing is good for Kyle Jenkins Applause fienne has a fourpoint Advantage they are on an eightnothing run over the course the last two and a half minutes the Miami Hurricanes one of their last nine from the floor Harlan Beverly will fire for three ahead Harlan Beverly a fourth year Junior out of Detroit Michigan played in all of four games last season Murray missed the final 30 due to lingering back injury that required surgery the last time he saw substantial minutes in college basketball youve got to go back to the 20192020 season its really impressive to see players weighed out injuries like that especially a back injury that can be a really tough one to recover from especially in the sport of basketball Beverly topped the key looking firing can he make it backtoback no too short not strong enough one and done for Miami offensively pulling the ball into the front court is Burger can help the hamburger threw it away he had Justin vanderbond the Boston College transfer wide open it was great help by Miami they set a pick stop stop over the pick and he threw it away I think Jenkins was hoping vanderbaum was going to roll and he popped out the ball ended up on the Baseline so a turnover Music and Lafayette Miami with a chance to retake the lead Bensley Joseph Anthony Walker Nigel pack North chattel near Harlan Beverly the five on the floor for coach larenega theyll work down low for North Chad omear who pulls up and thats no good my struggling from the floor early lafayettes playing

Lafayette boy theyre quick with their feet theyve hung with Miami the first 10 plus minutes in this game but now the turnovers are starting to cost them yeah theyre getting a little uh a little ahead of themselves down there a little panicked Jordan Miller checks back in Anthony Walker will take a seat talking about Harlan Beverly by the way just got this note its the first time that Harlan Beverly has seen game action officially in 347 days it was his first threepointer made since January 2nd of 2021 against your former alma mater the Clemson Tigers thats awesome its so great to see a kid hang in there like that for a year and and recover from an injury like that I really like that Nigel pack gives minded lead back they lead by two under nine minutes left to play in the half here in Miami welcome back college basketball good to be back with you on acc Network extra oh Boyle working on Miller this is an easy look from the elbow yeah its a good bucket for Van Der Bond hes a good looking shot squared up face the basket and pull the trigger this first bucket is a leopard so all square 17 all Nigel pack too strong off the back of the iron and offensive rebound by Jordan Miller and then Miller and North Channel Mir both go up well see who they credit the basket to you I think it was Miller it was Miller and hes got his first points of the season pressure and a tight man here Ryan Pettit the guard bringing the ball up the floor Lafayette that threes no good by vanderbong because its back in the hands of the leopards theyll fire away again this time its DJ Berger its 20 to 19 Lafayette hes 24 from Deep hes got six points here for the first half tonight two teams that arent scared to shoot it from way downtown now it gets swiped out of the hands of Nigel pack Harlan Beverly with a dribble drive and thats going to be a charge Mike Jordan loves what he sees on the far side of the floor for the Lafayette Leopards they lead by one 733 left to play here for the half in Miami Music foreign Music Applause Coral Gables head coach Jim larranega in his 12th season as the head coach of the University of Miami basketball program 226 victories 141 losses and he led his hurricanes on a remarkable run last season Murray have culminated in a trip to the elite eight I thought he did a masterful job last season he took that team and he gave them free reign to sort of come together as a team with a unique characteristics and they just meshed and became magical last year he did a fantastic job with that team it was amazing we were talking earlier you rewind a year ago we were upstairs in the Suites here broadcasting a Miami exhibition against Nova Southeastern up the road in Fort Lauderdale one of the Premier Division two teams in college basketball Miami won that game like 10695 but you walked out of it feeling rather unimpressed and as the year went on they got better and better and better yeah I remember Kyle we walked away scratching our heads a little saying whats going on here and Ill tell you what its just like you said every week they got better and better and they meshed and gelled Music had their own personality as a team and they just really came around at the end and so much of it Murray its predicated on chemistry if theyre in trouble coachelle will call timeout theyll run a set offensively but its the oldfashioned motion offense you trust your teammates you know where everybodys going to be and you make it happen on the offensive end you got it and that all starts with trust in the man at the top which is coachell they trust him they know his system works theyre going to stick with it and make it work Isaiah Wong pulls up 43 no good too short one and done Fulton down with a rebound Murray really the biggest difference here in the early going Miami has eight offensive rebounds but they havent been able to convert in just five second chance points thats not enough Kyle youre gonna fight your way to get second uh rebound offensive rebounds youve got to convert those youve got to make those count and make the other team pay and they just havent been able to convert those tonight burger with the basketball five on the shot clock steps back in the face of Wong no good and air ball Jordan Miller has it here comes Miami in transition there for the second best team in college basketball in transition last season behind only Arkansas State but Miami turns it over Applause Dash Rivera seeing a lot of run here early vowel on the floor and theyre gonna get Nigel pack with a foul and a little push underneath on the far side the Baseline see here a little too much with that right hand and left forearm yeah refs just going to try to clean it up a little bit so it doesnt get going for later in the game well Nigel Packs gonna have to take a seat thats his second and youd assume hes probably out until the start of the second half 2019 Lafayette hes scoring drought once again nearing two and a half minutes for Miami a scrappy leopards team here early Applause Bolton the point guard working on Miller Far Side Baseline now vanderbahn up in a blocking foul has got to be called underneathon Bensley Joseph once you get in that Arc down there it doesnt matter if youve been stationary for five minutes yeah Joseph kind of bailed him out there because he was too far into the basket Im not sure he was going to convert that anyway Music anderbond saw action in 10 games as a freshman at Boston College last year LeBlanc shots against Virginia at 45 rebounds at Florida state scored five points against Duke with the ACC tournament in Brooklyn Ill tell you the transfer portal has definitely changed basketball right I mean for the kids as well as the programs and the teams Ill kiss off the glass for Van Der Bond its 2119 Lafayette leading Miami 5 41 left to play in the first half and Coral Gables as we start the college basketball season here tonight Vander Bond hits a pair so a threepoint lead for the leopards Music Lafayette went on an eightnothing run earlier in the half their largest lead four leading by three with 5 30 left to play Wong with a dribble drive right hand off the glass nowhere close down with the offensive rebound nor Chad omear missed the first got it again and hell go to the free throw line mayor definitely has a live body down there he gets a couple offensive rebounds and again cant convert we need to try to finish here long went up and just threw a wild shot off the right side of the glass omir tried to pop it back in got his own offensive rebound nor Chad omear in a six foot seven 248 pound third year sophomore out of Bluefields and Nicaragua was a second year freshman in Arkansas State last season where he earned Sunbelt Player of the Year honors he was the Sun Belt defensive player of the year played an all 29 games started 28 averaged nearly 18 points one of two it helps too hes got a 611 wingspan and a 37 inch vertical so hes a hes a hes a physical specimen inside yeah Jenkins into the hand of Rivera and thats a turnover see if Miami cant convert off this turnover here Ryan Pettit The Freshman out of Westfield New Jersey at his right shoe on the sideline so another turnover by Lafayette thats now their fifth turnover of the half to Miamis two yeah hes got it underneath for omeary wants the basketball back working down low on oh Boyle Isaiah Wong up top the Miller dribble Drive kicks it out to Bensley Joseph Wong 43 from the wing no good way too strong omir came down with the offensive rebound hes fouled in the pain with 4 45 showing on the game clock here in Miami there was a lot more ball movement on that possession got it got the ball to go inside a couple times come out you know its the old Inside Out throw the ball in somethings going to be open when you kick it back out good shot it just didnt go worth pointing out as well Miami in foul trouble here in the first half Lafayette in the bonus last foul was on Pettit his first team fifth yeah its a traveling violation on North Chad omear Music a slow start to the season for Miami one of their last seven from the field oh for their last four they havent scored in nearly four minutes and theyve elected to shoot 16 threes 16 of the first 28 Shots tonight on Pace to shoot 3043s in this game yeah thats a lot Applause another turnover Here Comes Miami in transition will get Poplar with a dribble drive and he threw that left arm but the foul is going to be called on Rivera that could have gone either way for me especially when Poplar extended that left arm yeah watch here lets see what he does with his arm a little bit of push off of that left arm well take it Applause Justin vanderbond will check back in Rivera is going to have to take a seat thats his second foul here in the first half so Riveras got two Fulton the quarterback has two long way too short on the Baseline jumper the hurricane seems to be forcing just a little too much here Music turnover by Lafayette itll remain leopards basketball but both point guards here on the bench Nigel pack has six points but two personal fouls and now CJ Fulton with Five Points hes got a pair of fouls Applause it back up top to OBoyle this is CJ Berger oh Boyle will fire away for three too strong off the right side of the iron Bentley Joseph down to the rebound for Miami works right comes back hell pull up and hit a pair and were all square boy that was nearly five minutes of basketball without a bucket for Miami especially Joseph breaks the ice with 3 40 left to play in the half were all square we got a good one here in Miami tonight Music lets go Center 22 all Miami and Lafayette with 340 remaining in the first half the Miami Hurricanes tonight boys shooting just a mere 27 from the field last season this is a crew that shot 47 yeah a reduction at 20 percent that that hurts a lot they just need to uh its one of those nights where the rims are a little tight they might want to try to get some shots from a little bit midrange as opposed to shooting threes and try to get get the bucket to open up a little for him and then they can go back to shooting threes after that 16 in the first 30 shots taken by Miami have been threes here tonight Miami five of 16 from threepoint territory vanderban hands it off no will keep it hell fire and pull up and hit silky smooth and a nice touch for the sophomore Center good looking shot squared up looking at the bucket Andrew bonds got six Wong inside to omir who works right and DJ Berger might have got a hand in there and omir is going to head to the free throw line for a oneonone opportunity you can see the Lafayette Defenders frustrating the Hurricanes a little bit it goes down inside and you see him collapse with three guys here we go goes inside they come down with the help swiping at it hit him in the arms area of concern for Miami early as well just one of four from the charity strike one for two needs to hit the first to get the second and he misses too strong off the back of the iron so Miami unable to capitalize on their opportunities early Lafayette hanging around theyve got a twopoint advantage Vander Bond now the sevenfooteromear off his feet now he pulls up a bit too strong but boy did he just create a nice look for himself about 10 feet away from the basket Miller for three and its good here we go Music smooth stroke no hesitation put it in its an area of his game that hes worked on Anthony Walker Wugga Poplar and Jordan Miller Coachella lumped into a category you know we cant have those guys shooting five threes a game but theyre good enough that they take one two or three we feel like were going to be in a really good spot yeah oh Boyle in trouble into the hands of Berger Applause Music wow from Deep with two seconds left no good Isaiah Wong has the rebound that rattled in and out that was halfway down for TJ Berger another three for Gordon Miller too strong thought he was feeling it tried to get a string a few right there Miami up by one 140 left to play in the half here in Coral Gables Berger just looked him off oh Boyle for three top of the T and he rattles it home boy Mike Jordan has got to love what he sees out of his guys here in the first half of Miami tonight just look over at that bench they all love it theyre going crazy over there theyre really happy with their performance at this point Jordan is as animated as any other player on the bench heres Isaiah wall Miami a onepoint lead well we said it about 20 minutes ago neither team is afraid to shoot it from outside and its proven to be the case Miami with seven made threes here in the first half seven of 19 37 from threepoint land Pettit far wing underneath oh Boyle contested and the bucket with a foul theres that old adage never foul the jump shooter Leo OBoyle for three its good give him another one from the free throw line oh Boyle a senior out of Scranton started all 30 games last season nice penetration with the kick out to him in the corner Poplar had to go running out after him and fouled him far side corner three is good and the foul Applause misses the opportunity for the fourpoint play so its Lafayette by two with 45 seconds left to play here in the half oh Boyle scored in double figures and seven of his nine Patriot League games last year Bentley Joseph now with the basketball far wing top of the key hell fire away for three and miss and theres a foul on the floor North Shadowmere is a big strong young man down low s gonna be not Justin vanderbong s first of the half yeah lafayettes having trouble keeping a body on those guys down low and theyre having to get real physical with them foreign Music has as many rebounds as any hurricane had in the first half last season Ken mcgusty had eight against Alabama and omir misses again Miami struggling mightily from the freethrow line a whistle on the floor Jordan Miller pointing out that there seems to be a wet spot up near the elbow so well take care of that 31 seconds left to play here in the half Lafayette for all intents and purposes can take the final shot here in the half and go into the locker room with the lead yeah Im sure thats what they have on their mind here theyve really put up a good effort this half playing with a lot of intensity a lot of energy playing very physical Music 30 to 28 Lafayette 25 seconds left to play in the half hard screen set by oh Boyle Berger with a basketball Applause fans of CJ Fulton whos back in with the two personal fouls dribbling working against Wong oh Boyle for three no good hes got his own rebound puts it up no good omir with the defensive rebound and he tosses it right into the hands of CJ Fulton heres a heave at the buzzer its no good off the left side of the glass and at the half here tonight right 30 28 in favor of the leopard what do you make of the first half I just think anytime you play a team that youre supposed to be uh its an underdog that team always has nothing to lose and everything to gain and some of thats going on theyve done is theyve taken Miami away from their game and theyre theyre almost dictating the terms here at this point 20 more minutes on opening night in college basketball here in Miami tonight the leopards with a twopoint lead coming out of the break against the Miami Hurricanes in the paint looking Fulton up top Jenkins for three is no good a foul on the floor two Miami players are down because that was going to be on Leo OBoyle first foul Nigel pack got twisted up down low and hes grabbing at that left hamstring but Jordan Miller just asked him if he was okay and he said Im good to go Nigel pack had two fouls in the first half so two its CJ Fulton the twopoint guard for these respective teams Miami spreads them out offensively pack will fire away for three that was no good omir down with the offensive rebound thats his 113 bound he is he is down there with his lunch pail hes working away hes definitely uh hes doing a great job down inside hes been outstanding down low in the paint however hes been unable to convert offensively oh four from the field one of four from the free throw line hes got a couple of opportunities right here and two very quick fouls by the leopards and we can see on that rebound he got he brought that ball down too low and the guards came down and tried to strip him of it instead of trying to keep it up higher oh Boyles gonna have to check out the Sharpshooter for the leopards vanderbonds back in omear out of the recess I suppose just the change of scenery now on this end of the floor makes all the world in a difference for North Channel mirror Music now a hybrid press here by the Miami defense to make this leopards offense uncomfortable Music Rivera underneath for Van Der Bond who pump fake looked like he had an easy layup now he goes back underneath he puts it up its no good boy the first look Murray I thought he had an easy look and a layup in at The Rim Yeah I think youre right hes a little intimidated I think or surprised that he was open that way theres North Shadow near down low with the right hand four quick points to start the second half for Nord Chad omear Five Points 12 rebounds Applause above the key they work it down low for Jenkins good ball movement for the leopards Fulton again dribble Drive got tangled up in transition Here Comes Isaiah wall Applause Great lead pass from Poplar really made that happen right there uh stealing a dunk Mike Jordan calls it timeout six nothing run to start the second half for Miami theyve got a four point lead over Lafayette Applause has not been a whole lot of scoring in the paint here tonight both teams satisfied to shoot the ball from 22 feet out and Beyond yeah just four points in the paint for Lafayette eight points in the pay for the hurricanes out of the timeout CJ Fulton leading the charge for the leopards on the far wing trouble picked up his dribble Music Jenkins over to Burger burger Baseline step back three on the way no good and transition will get popular working with the left hand back up top long for three after the dunk hes got a triple give him three more hes got 13 great defensive possession for the hurricanes come down at the other end gets it a its a three turns into an offensive possession there now Miami pressuring defensively this is a team last season there have certainly been some guys no longer here right Kim mcgusty Charlie Moore Sam wardenberg all three of which led a massive helping hand to the elite eight run but when that team last year smelt blood in the water they attacked and they just stepped on your throat and they didnt let up and they did a lot of it in transition Here Comes Nigel pack look at him fly up the floor underneath for Jordan Miller out for Poplar in the paint underneath he had a little bit too mustard on that yeah that was a great look he was hoping to catch him down low get a nice little dunk down below a little too much on that tried to throw it up originally for Jordan Miller who had to just swing it out to the near side Baseline for William Poplar right idea just a little bit too much zip on that pass yeah Music Applause Music Applause Music burger with a high screen from Van Der Bond rolls Burger double teamed up top now Fulton right wing Miller switches on to him in the paint looking underneath Jenkins three on the shot clock its no good second chance opportunity no good North Channel Mir down with the rebound another rebound for nor Chad OMeara Wugga Poplar with a strong drive and hell head to the freethrow line he put on the Jets there he turned it on and went to the hole nor Channel me or five points 13 rebounds Poplar heres another look taking it to the hole strong knew hes going to get hit held on to the ball goes to the freethrow line for two its the 46th time in the last 54 games by the way that Isaiah Wong has 10 plus points wow pacing the scoring here tonight with 13 points and four rebounds poplars first from the charity strike no good tight Rim rattles in and out a Leo oh boy will check back in for the leopards Miami the seven point lead on a ninenothing run to start the second half thats exactly the kind of thing you want to do when you come out of a half Rice go on a 90 run I think it ten so the scoring drought at three minutes and 40 seconds to start the second half for Lafayette Music theres a look underneath and a bucket for Jenkins Kyle Jenkins Junior out of Connecticut started every game he appeared in except for senior day last season had a season High last year 18 points at Duke inside Cameron Indoor Stadium Isaiah Wong for three feeling it that misses off to the right team 40 left to play Applause Jenkins up top Lafayette slowing down the offense inside for Leo OBoyle now Fulton thought about pulling up and hes fouled by Jordan Miller and Miller thats going to be his second personal foul 38 32 all Miami early here in the second half Applause Music okay wed open second half pulling away with a sixpoint lead your thoughts kinda Murray as we come out of the recess here to start the second half first five minutes I thought the Hurricanes did a fantastic job regrouping at halftime they came out much more intensity and you can definitely see it on the defensive end and I think its really helped them open up with that 10 100 run when we got going so a sixpoint lead for Miami Lafayette hanging around here in Coral Gables tonight had a twopoint lead at the half a little bit of foul trouble oh Boyle for three its no good a bit too short a foul on the floor are they gonna get Isaiah one I think they will reached around and grabbed the hips of Josh Rivera Applause boy looked like a pretty good box out to me yeah I think they were trying to say he initiated the contact backed out but I agree with you that was a little questionable so Isaiah his first foul of the night DJ Berger being double teamed by Joseph and Miller Fulton 43 its good Lafayette back within three with 15 minutes showing on the game clock here at the watsco center new floor by the way a new look for the Hurricanes here in Miami this season Nigel peck on the other end Applause matches the Fulton three Music all right hurricanes are making them work really hard for everything Applause good Hustle by Bentley Joseph ball rolled off his fingertips and sitting on the sidelines so itll remain Lafayette basketball yeah look at this hes on the ground chasing the ball two people on the ground chasing the ball they really uh Miami has definitely picked up the intensity and thats what they would consider on the coaching staff winning plays you got it this is a a Lafayette basketball team obviously nobody knowing what to expect and itll be a couple of weeks probably a good month before you really have a true understanding of what you have uh but these are the type of teams that coach larnega loves to schedule early in this case tonight Lafayette will play a similar style shoot a lot of threes and theyve got a bit of a height advantage yeah I do think this Lafayette team is a very good team theyre going to win a lot of games in The Patriot this year Jenkins is three no good off the left side of the rim a leopards team by the way that lost their two leading scorers in Neil Quinn and Tyrone Perry Quinn transferred to Richmond Perry to graduate to Tennessee Tech nor Chad omear underneath he could see the grit on his face wow very athletic play right there and watch Bensley Joseph guard a Defender one of the elite defenders in all of college basketball not just the Atlantic Coast Conference and now you see the intensity from Miami defensively you can hear the crowd and CJ Fulton is forced to call timeout 1338 left to play Miami by eight Music leaves Mike Jordan with the wood just one time out remaining the Final 14 minutes of this contest here tonight uh the intensity Murray has quickly picked up here for Miami in the second half yeah its its tripled what it was in the first half they really have come out and decided uh they want to put an end to this and theyre going to get after it so Music Miami outscoring Lafayette 155 here in the second half an eightpoint lead Lafayette had a twopoint lead at halftime Fulton 43 deep right wing its good the sophomore out of Ireland hes in his own its one of those nights for him hes in the zone right here now little Shimmy Shake on the near side wing and he fired away a step back three for Fulton Lafayette back to within five pack over for Wong Lafayette just daring Miami to shoot the three they pulled up 24 times from three tonight theres a turnover yeah just a little careless dribble off his foot the leopards trying to pull closer Applause Baseline Drive and Jordan Miller is going to get called for another foul thats going to be his third and Anthony Walker set the check in for Miami hell give Miller Jordan Miller with three fouls Five Points and five rebounds North Channel mere three points away from a double double hes got 13 rebounds and seven points Isaiah Wong leading all scores tonight with 13 Music point lead for Miami and TJ Berger stepped on the sideline turnover by the leopards Music DJ Fultons got a Lafayette High 11 points Lafayette now with eight turnovers Miami was six Nigel pack shook him off and he missed that was a quick shake off he is quick with the basketball in his hands in the paint behind the arc on the elbow Music nice look underneath for Jenkins nice feed from Leo OBoyle okay hes been calling for it down low hes had a mismatch there they switched Lee back to just three 1244 left the play a timeout coach laronega having a conversation with Nigel pack well take a break Miami by three Music the getaway sales event is going on a couple assists for Miami tonight a big addition to this program this season well you can see he can really stroke the ball very comfortable fires away he can also create space for himself with those quick moves he has he was Kansas States most improved player last season the big 12s most improved player first team all big 12 17 and a half points for rebounds a game and thats an offensive foul Anthony Walker his first foul of the night doesnt have a point doesnt have a rebound slow start to the season for Anthony Walker now an opportunity on the other end here for Lafayette to tie this game coach L having a conversation with the officials yeah Im not sure he had his feet set on that Remy stallions Leslie Jones Anthony Eads the officials here in Miami tonight all right Applause Miami defense continues to pressure the leopards 15 seconds on the shot clock Lafayette still unable to get anything going offensively all right got double team an opportunity in the corner for three no good off the fingertips of nor Chad omear two seconds left on the shot clock omir just went flying into the camera crew down on the Baseline so the leopards here with an opportunity with about two seconds left on the shot clock Music The Mirrors all right were flying into the seats not on the Baseline boy both teams are playing with a sense of urgency out there right now now the officials have gathered and I think they want to take a look at the clock I think they want to see how much time is left on the shot clock 4340 Miami leads over Lafayette 1124 left to play uh lets see here that ball looked like it actually probably went out around 39 seconds left uh so a nice job here by the officials to probably stop this thing and get this correct it did look like that ball might have hit the Baseline with about three and a half four seconds left and thats what theyll continue to review how about Lafayette Murray not going away in this ball game they are they are just persistent they will not go away they keep the pressure Miami really amped up the pressure and these guys are handling it they are coming back for more usually when you put that kind of pressure on a team uh they turn it over they throw it away they try to get rid of the ball as soon as possible and its not happening Lafayette is really handling his pressure well Music thank you Music man they put 18 seconds back on the shot clock I think maybe it hit the rim okay then thats what they were checking for I think it hit the rim when he when he put it up all right so an opportunity here for Lafayette didnt even think about that saw it hit off the hands of North Chad OMeara and thought maybe they wanted to add a couple of ticks left to that shot clock but lafayettes got 18 4340 Miami lead CJ Fulton up top right wing Miami continues to pressure the leopards defensively underneath Rivera working Fulton for three in the tie yes Music Applause all square with 11 minutes left to play the plus Center Fultons got 14

OBoyle and North Channel near set the check back in Anthony Walker will take a seat and he struggled tonight two points over five from the floor oh for three from three so Walker takes a c North chattel mirrors back in theres a lot of athleticism here on the floor right now for Miami well get Poplar maybe the most athletic player on the team omir can jump right out of the gym instead of the fact that pack Wong and Miller out there Jordan Miller one of the best offensive rebounders in college basketball a little undersized but he was unbelievable on the boards last season yeah really is a lot more athletic this year this team is theres Isaiah Wong step back three no good he gets fouled by TJ Berger now Isaiah Wong will try to capitalize on three freebies something Josh Rivera couldnt do on the other end all right maybe a little bit dances around the pick reaches around at the last minute and catches him here I think hes got a tendency to do that yeah very sneaky right there

John Simmons who played for the Kings from 98 to 2002 stands that lead by eight this is their largest lead it ties their largest lead of the night Applause turning point right now when that clock

Fulton with seven seconds on the shot clock down to five oh Boyle for three thats a hierarchy three no good nearly came down with his own offensive rebound the balls in the hands of Nigel pack packed

excited that basketball is back cheering on their Miami Hurricanes who made a Deep Run and an appearance in the elite eight last season Applause Miami by seven 520 left to play along hands it off to Jordan Miller the leopards are packing the paint poplar pushed off and its an offensive foul and he just asked the official how leading his case but hes not going to get it here hes using that off arm right there now wolves is going to check out Betsy Josephs gonna come back in Music now woga didnt like the call but it was the right call as soon as you see extension with either the right or left arm Music you dont see too many guys embellish it all that much youre gonna get called for yeah Lafayette has not scored a bucket in their last five minutes and 53 seconds Music Applause hes at right now Justin vanderbaum with a bucket in the foul hell head to the freethrow line to Lafayette right back within five a chance to make it four its hanging around Kyle or off so just hang around long enough they think theyll have a chance to win Ive been waiting to see if they could feed Van Der Bond a little bit more on that low post block area all night long lafayettes got the size advantage in this contest tonight he makes it its a fourpoint game 5 13 left to play Music Applause Music Miamis attempted 313pointers here tonight more than they attempt at all of last season with authority Jordan Miller look at the strength he definitely elevated over everybody there used his left hand put that in that was a beautiful shot that was strong with the left hand a back door cut for old Boyle turns it over Bensley Joseph to the rack and he got fouled hard he slipped and then he got fouled by CJ Fulton and CJ Fulton thats going to be his fourth personal foul Bentley Joseph will head to the freethrow line for two Music right wrist a little bit he got up uh out from under him here maybe he slipped a little longer so he stepped on his foot so he only he kind of ran himself right into the foul there was really not a whole lot CJ Fulton was he going to do in that situation TJ Berger set the checks back in for Lafayette hes not gonna be able to leave Fulton on the bench very long though I think they actually called that foul on the floor so this is a oneonone opportunity for Bentley Joseph and he misses it but Jordan Miller tipped it around at the end of the hands of the leopards in transition and itll remain Lafayette basketball just not Quicken off offensively Kyle Jenkins uh was the recipient of that pass but Bentley Joseph was just screaming back down the floor yeah ideally in that situation you want the ball in the middle and you want two guys one on each Wing just didnt pan out Miami by six Lafayette with a chance to creep in a little bit closer yes Kyle Jenkins caught the Kane sleeping a little bit under the basket right there Miami has not been all that sharp in this ball game here tonight Applause Lafayette has played really really well North cattlemir give them two and a chance from the free throw line for an extra one thats what they brought North Channel mirror to Miami four right there look here hes using skill and strength theres two dribbles into the rack pure skill and followed by pure strength right there conventional threepoint play for North Chad omear the lead is back to seven Applause Burger five on the shot clock step back three lets it fly no good Vander bombing left hand no good grabs his own offensive rebounder Tangled Up Down in the paint whistles its a jump ball well head to a timeout with 3 43 left to play itll be Lafayette basketball when we come back 3 43 left to go Miami by seven leopards of Lafayette Isaiah Wong pacing everybody to 16 points tonight CJ Fultons got 14 Lafayette hanging around here Murray uh if you hate the harp on it but if theyve been if they could be a little bit better from the free throw line theyd be probably within two or three at this point yeah theyre really going to be disappointed when they look at that and see the three uh the opportunities they missed with the free throws Music Applause had it swings it Fulton two left with one they got it off no good here comes Isaiah Wong in transition Nigel packed thats an easy bucket Applause pack one of the foul did get it on Miami by nine their largest lead of the game with three minutes left to play trying to put this one Out Of Reach but Lafayette has not gone away all night long it has definitely not been easy for him tonight Fulton underneath its taken away One More Time by Miami Applause thats the 12th turnover tonight by Lafayette theyre five of 14 from the freethrow line its made all the difference in the world in this game to open up the season here this evening Nigel pack says I dont care what the score is Im gonna fire away shot right there kind of uses his man as a little bit of a screen there fires away now with 220 left to play Miami going to try to Salt it away Applause pet it for three is too strong Rivera with the offensive rebound but he gave it right into the hands of Isaiah Wong Applause Miami not slowing down offensively pack says Ill do it again no good oh man might have been an opportunity there though yeah OMeara really wanted that ball in the post right there he wanted it and an opportunity to kill about 20 more seconds yeah but under two minutes left to play Miami with a 12point lead now its a long back to nine Fulton hes got 17 big night for CJ Fulton to start his season Applause minute 30 left to play lafayettes got just one timeout left Bentley Joseph goes hard to the rack that Amber bonds screaming its got to be a tie up underneath Music for a hold and Betsy Joseph will go to the free throw line Joseph gives that hesitation move and just keeps pressure on the defense here hesitates goes pressure all the way theyre going to call that every time hard to the rim and he got tied up with vanderbond Music really nice showing for this Lafayette ball club though under the direction of first year head coach Mike Jordan here tonight previously at Colgate as an assistant for nine Seasons hell be really really encouraged when they put on the film yeah I think he will uh he should be proud of his players tonight next up for Miami Friday here at home against UNC Greensboro its for Lafayette theyve got a brutal nonconference schedule two games inside the friendly confines of the Kirby Sports Center playing Five Road games before their home opener on November 22nd this weekend theyre at St Johns to the Big Apple they go Applause and Joe pack with the offensive rebound after a couple of opportunities Miami will pull it back larenago whistling saying settle down boys yeah trying to take the air out of the ball here get it over with Music five on the shot clock Wongs gonna have to fire away down to two Bentley Joseph will pull the trigger no good door Channel near the rebound and omear going up he got fouled hell head to the freethrow line for two Im not sure he went over the back here a little bit maybe hes just jumping over everybody boy can he fly though can he its unbelievable Im telling you the guy that hes not a pogo sticker 240 pounds right hes uh hes a big man Music sorry nothing to hang your heads about if youre Lafayette coming out of this ball game tonight theyve been really really good and Mike Jordan when its all said and done and they cool off a little bit theyre going to be really really proud of the way that these guys play yeah and you think about it they went on the road here right there at an ACC uh ACC teams home court and you really never know how the kids are going to respond right they could have come down here and been intimidated and been uh you know forced into playing a different way but they didnt they came in and they puffed up their chest and they played hard did a fantastic job and it helps the Hurricanes right it helps you have to play against a gutty tough team like that its the first North Chad omear 11 points and 15 rebounds its the first 15 rebound game by a hurricane since nicer Brooks on December 8th of 2020 against Florida Gulf Coast University this one on Ice in their home opener against the lafayettes leopards here this evening Kyle Jenkins for three is no good Music all right I feel pack coughs it up and now Jenkins gets fouling boy pack just got triple team down low on the Block hes pleading his case and he got held I got fouled but to no avail Kyle Jenkins would go to the freethrow line look at that triple team down low yeah they just surrounded and then pack who had it taken away commits the foul Music yeah he just came down with that right arm a little too hard Music looks like Isaiah Thompson and one additional leopard here will check in in the winning moments of this contest here tonight Thompson a sophomore guard out of White Plains New York as Jenkins misses the first all sorts of problems with the freethrow line with leopards here tonight Devin Hines the sophomore out of West Palm Beach back home for a night average seven and a half minutes as a freshman last season hes into the game for the leopards here for the final 42 seconds left Applause nice crowd on hand at the watsco center tonight we thank you for joining us for opening night of college basketball a long season awaits for both of these teams Isaiah Wong calls time out lets take a quick break 42 seconds left Music its been a fun opening night of college basketball Isaiah Wong with 16 points for Miami Fulton was 17 507 from Deep for the leopards Jenkins has 12 for Lafayette Nigel pack has 14 in his Kanes debut or Channel near with a doubledouble 11 points and 15 rebounds for Miami Music has this kind of Talent on the team this year that youre going to see some major upsets I think theyre going to really beat victims Isaiah Thompson vowels Nigel pack we had 42 seconds left Music burger and foot check back in both with four fouls foreign Music misses on the other end theyll probably stop fouling at this juncture down by 11 Applause the Boyle hands It Off The Fulton nearing the final 30 seconds left to play youre in Miami tonight Lafayette needs a three theyre gonna have to fire away Music and theyll work it down low to Jenkins far corner now prepared and he misses Bentley Joseph down with the rebound and that should do it and maybe not Applause we are still playing hard down to the end oh Burger commits the foul send Bentley Joseph to the line for two Lafayette gave Miami a run here tonight this little contest on opening night yeah I think its the kind of opening game thats helpful for both teams I think Miami both both sides are going to learn something from the night and uh hurricanes had to battle all right had to show some character tonight to really really hunker down and get ready to win I think for Miami what theyre about to put on film will expose maybe a little bit opening night and uh you may very well see a much more polished team four days from now yeah these games are great for the coaches and the players as well right you get a chance to look at it all on tape and break it down and sort of talk through the good things and the bad things right its all about the good Bad and the Ugly here final 10 seconds left to play I am even a 13point lead as they head towards an opening night victory over the Lafayette Leopards Jordan Miller takes it away and thatll put it on ice Miami beats Lafayette by a final score of 6754 Murray German your final thoughts as we wrap this one up here this evening hey it was a fun one to watch fun one to work guys came out and played hard did all they could to win both sides and thats all he can ask all right so for Mary Jarman in our entire production crew
