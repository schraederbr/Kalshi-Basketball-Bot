scuffling though as we mentioned down the stretch dropping for their last seven so we are set to go Clarence Armstrong Ron Gruber Jamel Spearman our officials as were about to tip it off in the night cap here inside the Coliseum Applause Virginia Tech the 11th seed NC State number six hear the ACC tournament and the Hokies win the opening tip Greg Gantz starting off guarding grant bazilly that puts a little more athleticism on him Couture launches the first three but short and a high rebound Tipton control nicely by Smith Hill launch and hit it but he was not waiting around Smith needed that one his last two games hes been five of 25 from the field just four of 14 from threepoint range so thats a good sign for NC State if the quavon Smiths getting off to a good start its on the night started for North Carolina against Boston College tough move inside vermonts down to strike DJ Burns having to guard Justin mutts with Gantt on bazilly and that means that I think Mike young is going to put DJ Barnes in as many ball screens as he can to move them around the floor so they can attack him out on the perimeter both of these teams take care of the ball really well Burns getting in close EJ burns the big grad has six nine out of Rock Hill South Carolina Kevin Keith sixth the air at NC State to the schools most victories in a regular season since 198788 no foul will go against mutts number one DJ Burns is a load inside hes got a great touch and the feet of a ballerina with the way he can move those feet Making Moves In The Post he transferred in from Winthrop where he played for Pat Kelsey whos now the head coach at Charleston just punched their ticket in the NCAA tournament but he started his career Tennessee you know people think oh hes a mid major player transferred to NC State now he started at Tennessee play well down the stretch honorable mention all ACC this season with a strong move but no Smith with a rebound good job by NC State to stay in front to make that a really tough two for Sean Padula NC State defeating Virginia Tech and their only meeting in Blacksburg 7369 but as mentioned Hunter Couture did not play in that game hes hurt at the time spin by Burns and youre right as far as that footwork he just didnt finish it he can spin in the lane and hes got such a soft touch thats for the kick out bezilla gives it up Couture will drive it no finish though DJ Burns came over and bothered that shot and it takes a bump uses the window beautifully wanted to foul too oh he created that contact that was offense initiated but you like the aggressiveness or quavion Smith to start this game all accs second team as was his teammate jarkel join us a lot of big games 32 against FSU 25 against Georgia Tech he gets hot and he can get rolling much taking the pain blocked by Burns it was all over him good recovery by DJ Burns boy when he screams he stage screen for a while jointer getting it inside for the quick strike by Gantz not a big scorer a great start for North Carolina State getting the ball down Court quickly if you can score quickly in transition thats not going to go as a fast break basket but it was early offense score they can 78 points again number two in the conference off the fake Collins got a good look at all Nets Applause Andrew Collins with a really nice move there the shot fake thats Smith off the floor and then the little pullup jumper from the midrange so you stay bidding for win number 23 he dropped their last two regular season games to Clemson to Duke a good double team by Justin mutts off the dribble by DJ Burns when he spun he spun right into mutts Couture is such a spectacular tournament last year mutts maybe one pass too many hes a terrific passer and at times maybe 21 selfish and thatll misfire by Smith that was a heat check fire took way around Smith that was a logo shot but Smith did a great job help side defense knocking that ball away and NC State wants to get their their number is 40 deflections if they get 40 deflections they feel like theyve been really active defensively NC State of the deflection Joyner will lay it in thats what you cannot do Dave against North Carolina State but Doula took the ball got and knocked away and then all of a sudden youre watching NC State lay it in on the other end its one thing we should not see a lot of in this game both of these teams do an excellent job of taking care of the ball Collins again but not this time a little bit too early that was just on one side of the floor didnt make the defense move back only turns it over about 10 times a game Joyner feeling it absolutely buried that one to make it 134 this is a confident tandem of guards with Joyner and Smith there is not a shot they feel like they cannot make now both of them averaging 17 a handful bazilly yes and one passing theres the passing of Justin mutts leads him in assists averaging close to five a game thats fifth in the league as a forward ESPNs exclusive presentation to college basketball is brought to you by New York Life over 12 000 agents there to help guide you through lifes happiest and most difficult times and Ameriprise Financial advice worth talking about Jay bill is this NC State program every case there in the 50s in 1959 ACC tournament Champs a rich history in this tournament an incredible tradition in history in the Atlantic Coast Conference of Tommy Burlesons who played on those great NC State teams with Monty Tau David Thompson Tim Stoddard who went on to fame and the Major Leagues with the Baltimore Orioles whatever case was really one of really the one that started it all the tournament used to be played out of Reynolds Coliseum which Im sure a lot of coaches in the league werent too happy with back then a good start here for the pack Applause out here for Joyner Smith will let fly got another one you cant even figure out what his range is as long as hes inside a half court he can put it up as you said he had been scuffling with that three and only hitting 33 percent for the season hes taken over 250 of them about eight and a half attempts a game but on fire here early tonight Greensboro or Casey Marcel is doing such a good job defensively switching off blowing up dribble handoffs and exchanges medulla needs that much room to Fire and hit a 61 sophomore you can also really get rolling beyond that threepoint line John Padula went to Edmond Memorial High School in Oklahoma you know who else went there who did Phil self Joseph claims to be the best player ever at Edmond Memorial but I dont necessarily believe that medullas in the photo definitely in the photo shot clock down to five finding an open man underneath and the dunk Solana getting free and NC State playing free and easy now they are really spreading this Virginia Tech defense out youd have to go out so far to guard Smith and Joyner mutts spottied up and fouled on the plate 1347 left here in the first half what do you say in The Scouting Report close out the trekwavion Smith at 2930 feet and then the little screen up top and then a rescreen in the slot and dewana just rolls right to the basket nobody able to pick him up thats why you want to run so much out of the middle of the floor its so hard for help to cover all that you run it from the side help his position you run it from the middle its more difficult for help to recover black picked up his first foul the Doula will try another not this time swung inside again and once again the Finish By Joanna with the floor so spread that opens up and these screens are being set high and that opens up the roll theres just a lot of a lot of space on the court the Courts 50 feet wide and right now NC States using every inch of it and theyre finding the big the 611 Junior thats going to be a whistle inside NC State averages about 13 assists a game but that wasnt even a screen it was just a little rub and then a roll to the basket those little random screens in transition kind of an early drag but sometimes you dont even have to set the screen youre so worried about the ball but the screener becomes open on the roller OT at the line NC State hot they have made eight out of 10 to open up a 2211 lead Collins hits the bench and coaching will get another and big DJ Burns time to get back on so Im gonna back him off for a moment too bad he doesnt have any Personality yeah hes not having any fun playing the game its real drudgery hit a six nine grad from South Carolina when NC State plays a home game when DJ Park the burns gets the ball the crowd starts cheering just when he gets it before he does anything they love him has hit some big games against weight 31 points nine rebounds Applause Music Applause jump shot on the way and that wont fall but everything else has been falling early on theyre going to get a second crack because Burns got the lot more cello driving he takes the foul and hell be at the line oh Rodney rice just was bending over for that ball you got to get possession possessions more important in position and its more important than trying to take it the other way you got to get the ball first and Bryce was there to get it he was hurt earlier in the season he is a talented offensive player that is going to be really really good Rochelle drops in the first former Virginia Cavalier played two years for Tony Bennett in Virginia Applause and hitting 42 percent beyond the threepoint line thats the best among the regulars and he had 15 points the last time these two teams played hes such a good Defender you know the balance of the guards that Trio of guards that NC state has they can all score theyre pretty good Defenders Marcel I think is the best of the threes the tour doubling back hell draw the foul held up the ramp past their sixfoot sophomore with number one Couture is such a good cutter and constant motion and with his shot preparation hes ready to shoot it when the ball arrives that makes him even more dangerous 43 at the threepoint line a spin by Padula cant finish the play NC State wants to run Smith quickly gets it to go what a tough shot too oh probably got hit but it didnt seem to bother to quavon Smith making that first shot well hes seeing a big basket right now he is attacking at both ends of the floor yeah quick 10 points for him and a great early sign here for the wolf pack Applause choppy Offensive start here for the Hokies Jay yeah they got to start putting some back Cuts in the tour drags the foot and a travel Applause Smith averages about 17 points per game that is third in the league but gets the block on Sean Padula and just a rip and run and taking it the other way good luck staying in front of for Cleveland Smith wants to be a coach and in the Huddle he called for this screening action he wanted to set up this play that helped them win the game against Notre Dame last night and Jensen must gave him a shout out like hey if he doesnt set that screen we dont win that game I dont get that dunk and thats just how smart Hunter Couture is is he knew how they were defending him earlier in the game he brought it up to coach in the Huddle and Coach had enough trust in him that they let him run that action and the result a gamewinning play a gamewinning screen from Hunter Couture oh thats a exactly right Holly he is a really smart high IQ basketball player but that you know that could solve this whole employee issue just hire the guys as assistant coaches offensive here on burns 2312 NC State hes also you know trying his hand interviewing you know working with the Press Corps and firing off some questions that Mike Young his head coach had fun with that question and the next question so Hunter Couture is far too smart to be a member of the media senior out of Orlando and missed the first time they played lets got Airborne left it short followed the Miss right back up that almost went but hell be at the line Justin mutz is a really good rebounder started his career at High Point went to Delaware and then to Virginia Tech hes got two masters degrees already and hes the leading rebounder on this team eighth in the league just under eight rebounds a game but you talk about a respected player around the league that really does everything out there great passer outstanding Defender yeah look at all the degrees I asked him about a month ago I said are you going to the doctorate is that in your future and he said well not thinking about it right now but maybe down the line when Im done playing ball a scholar athlete of the year you dont get all those in one year hes had to work a lot longer than that mutts as the stripe drops it in he makes 62 percent Four Points so far tonight by the way two fouls on DJ Burns of the wolf pack and he goes to the bench 1106 to go in a half so in a little bit of trouble Music right now Virginia Tech theyve been getting spread out and you have to stay on NC States best Shooters and thats gonna thats gonna spread you out a little bit but the help side has to be active and you have to move on the Flight of the ball in order to stay with NC State Joyner back it up averaging 17 cell wants to drive it keeps on working cant finish the shot though he did everything but NC State switching a lot of exchanges theyve been aggressive in for kids this kid had a great look inside its going to be batted out thats going to stay on this end with 10 and a half to go yeah Lynn Kidd is that four double figure games this year he had 14 points and five rebounds against NC State earlier this year but he hed love to have that one back that was an easy one and he makes 66 percent of his shots but that one would not drop a nice job by Jack Clark to really stay with Couture off that staggered screen kid giving up the dribble shot clock at eight Collins trying to Baseline sealed got it inside the kick out is missilla got an excellent look but it wouldnt fall it was a good look but a little bit of a rough shot but Couture might take the first one yes jumping inside Joyner Applause kid knocks the rebound to a teammate here come the Hokies behind rice States doing such a good job of putting pressure on the ball if there is an opening to make a pass vision is taken away the tour to the paints not there NC State airtight D heres Smith yes sir another one from Lee downtown what do you do with that and you think youve stopped the ball all of a sudden the 27footer goes up and youre taking it out of the net whistle here with 9 50 to go and a foul on rice you should say on Joyner I mean thats beyond range hes three steps outside the threepoint line Hunter Couture is a really good Defender but you know you dont think about and you need to with turquavion Smith but you dont think about man I got to pick him up at 26 feet and make sure he doesnt pull up after we stop the ball so much for a shooting sloppy so itll be rice at the line here for the Hokies and drops in number one and Padula coming back on they need someone to get a hot hand Virginia Tech has missed six consecutive shots NC States done such a good job of staying with cutters putting great pressure on Sean Padula and sticking with Hunter Couture off every screen switching if necessary and NC State when they switch they switch to take something away I mean theyre looking to get a hand on the ball and they can be really disruptive Keiths calling for a play Applause cant handing off medulla out on Smith up he goes for two more he made that look easy well you press up on him and youre seeing Virginia Tech hedge on just about every ball screen action but you press up on him and hes going to go by you you give him some face hes going to pull up and knock in a 25footer he is 15 points Todd half for it to cuevan Smith Collins going around the back trying to get free gets the jumper up there but no where the quality of shot difference between what NC State is getting and what Virginia Tech is getting is pretty Stark heres Marcel oh yeah and thats the biggest lead tonight 3116 NC State to timeout Dave some of these are four pointers youre not gonna have to go to replay to see if their foot was on the lines my goodness what a shooting exhibition from Deep from the NC State Wolfpack Subway series Colgate Red Raiders demolished Lafayette in the championship game for the Patriot League third straight turning logo Matt langel has built a dynasty at Colgate a fun offensive team to watch they take care of it and shoot 41 percent from three as a team Oklahoma State on the bubble first team out for Joe lunardi doing it well right now theyre getting to the rim with Chris Harris there but the bottom line is theyve got a lot of length and speed they already have three blocks in this game back to OB and Jay in Greensboro gentlemen thank you very much NC State on fire from 35 out of seven to open up a 3116 lead North Carolina won easily over BC tonight they face the number two seed Virginia in the quarters tomorrow winner this one will take on the 3C Clemson NC State shooting has been the headline and the thing were going to talk about but their defense has been pretty good Justin mutz going oneonone in the post against Greg Gantt and just went right through his chest but if you havent seen a lot of easy shots for Virginia Tech in this first half sure havent different story for the wolf pack as the shooting from mid Court Moana getting active here in the first half hes had a couple of baskets not this time Smith double team passed right out to Casey Marcel they got it right inside the ball movement has been really good for NC State and Smith has 15 is an open man underneath its kit for two a really good little low Cross by Hunter Couture subtle cross screen to get link Kidd open and Couture knows that if he sets a screen first hes more likely to get open than off any action as a cutter yeah well swing it Marcel that three wont drop and a little bit of momentum all of a sudden for the Hokies you got to get some stops in order to eat into this lead but this is a resilient Virginia Tech Team theyre tough much up top working on Marcel he bats it away right to Smith over the top for Joyner to lay it in great teamwork there Padula on the other end theyre going to try it and the stuff by can well thats the way you answer you give up an easy one in transition due to the deflection and NC States got a number of deflections in this ball game but thats the way you answer yeah Joyner sticks in twopointer what are you doing MJ Collins played really good defense there that was just Superior offense over good defense play the series back and forth by the way Hunter Couture scoreless so far thats a major story for the oak hes given a tournament he had last year underneath for kid and thats going to be an offensive foul thatll be a charge at 5 49 to go the nothing but net crew will be back at 11 30 Eastern after this game to break down all four New York Life ACC tournaments second round games well have post game interviews plus a look at it Thursdays quarterfinals all on the ACC Network and of course more on Jim Boeheim and the end of his career as the head coach of Syracuse University a huge story here today I love watching nothing but Nets but boy Kelsey Riggs has a tough job she has to say National Champion Luke Hancock National Champion Joe Berry National Champion Carlos Boozer takes her 15 minutes for the intro to go through all the Championships a lot of wins up there on that set a little Bob Smith again gets hit and hes going to shoot three thats how hard it is to guard him right now look at our national champs and shes just looking at Kelseys looking up one of their accomplishments Luke Hancocks had he finally wore a tie though did you see them down in Miami I did talk about Casual Friday my goodness youre professionals gentlemen were a tie well they are a lot of fun to listen to and break down if anything thats happened here at the ACC tournament its just nothing like this event Smith meanwhile at the line shooting three working on 15 this is the first couple though hes too close yeah gonna be the problem 71 percent at the line for the sophomore I think the mini slump is over I think thats a pretty good bet the way he shot the three tonight makes one of the three and its 3622 he has 16 maybe thats the answer just foul him every time down he scores fewer points who will catch fire for the Hokies they need an answer to that question is really calling for it but a whistle there bodies dropping both of them Hokies Brazilian a little bit of pain there and Couture is down two Victoria hurt his elbow earlier in the season was out for quite some time looks like he took a knock there Clark with his second foul its been so difficult for Virginia Tech to make passes against the NC State Defense theyve wound up dribbling more than Mike young would like I think it was brazily hitting his own team yeah yeah and fell right over the top of him checking out his own elbow Grand pizzelle 69 grad from Wisconsin and so Couture is shooting a one and one as they go to the monitor here hes 75 percent and theyre confirming the shooter thats the reason Clarence Armstrong is over there at the monitor and a 3622 Advantage for NC State they look good from Jump Street tonight so check out the bracket again our New York Life ACC mens tournament bracket one more quarterfinal ticket to punch here tonight Clemson awaiting the winner Virginia North Carolina at seven oclock tomorrow thatll be on ESPN so Couture will be the shooter Music and Hunter the number five man all time and threepointers made at Virginia Tech at the foul line he was the most valuable player of the ACC tournament last year when Virginia Tech went on that fourday run to win the title and stamp a ticket to the NCAA tournament we had 31 points in that final against Duke he was just spectacular when you were checking out the bracket and all the seating before things got underway in Greensboro who were you picking to go all the way well Miami I think Miamis probably the best team but you never know in this tournament format its not often that the number one seed or not as often as you would think that the number one seed goes on and wins the tournament and you know what Dave sometimes for NCAA tournament success sometimes not winning the tournament in the worst thing too strong and tipped out by NC State with 449 to go it just had the feel of being pretty darn wide open coming in yeah nobody had really a stat no team had established itself as being Head and Shoulders above the crowd the best teams proved to be the more consistent you Smith too strong medulla had to rebound knocked away oh yes exactly what to do with it its a beautiful wraparound pass by gan 3824 the pack so far any handoff action you know the pressures really gotten the Virginia Tech and Mike young holding his hands out saying settle down a little bit settle down off the offensive rebound Gantt takes it to the basket draws the defense and just wraps right around Lynn Kidd just a beautiful pass got two Defenders to commit and NC State is clicking on just about all cylinders in this first half leading in the paint 1610 leading from the logo by a bunch there a lot of the shots have come from Smiths back on top for Joyner who makes 36 percent beyond that line hell fire up another one yes sir hes just measuring it just give it a little Shake step back his step back move is so good but you could just see him measuring that shot and Kevin Keiths telling Casey Marcel get up and impact the ball Applause y going strong Banks it in that was a strong move by Grant basili I dont know that any big guys play better over the last 10 12 games ACC honorable mention 12 to 69 bazilly five points tonight fairly quiet Joyner shot clock at seven here he is again rounding out and he comes free to Padula hope hes trying to cut in hell drive it and blocked by dewana and did he Sprint to the other end Smith with a triple yes wow this is like a video game how do you guard this back court for NC State good luck to you the tour has been silenced tonight and the Wolf Pack threatening to run away with this thing in the first half Joyner on Padula Applause Marcel off the fake a step back and before the shot he drew the foul on Couture NC State rolling here to a 4426 advantage ESPNs exclusive presentation to college basketball its brought to you by principal when you take care of your team they take care of business probably Music Applause all right everybody its two cups coming over at halftime Jim behind no longer the head coach at Syracuse after 47 years well hear from the Hall of Famer what he had to say after the game also bubble teams that actual have those highlights to quote Jay bilis Joyner and Smith are legit well they are and obviously the pressure is great from NC State but Virginia Techs been in the bonus for a while like slow the game down get the thing inside get free throw stem the tide that way a little bit I dont know if theres any slow into tarkwavian Smithtown Dave make sure billis picks up the check it would be a first I pick up checks I just hand them to Dave and grateful grateful to pay and this guys made a difference here dewana 611 Junior huson has scored eight points well hes been active on both ends of the floor but after he sets a screen he rolls hard to the basket and posts up and to NC State anytime theres two men on the ball they pass out of it right away so theyve been moving the ball from side to side and Smith and Joyner theyve got 31 points combined I mean those two were outscoring Virginia Tech by themselves facility downstairs Awana coming out of nowhere again to block the shot look at Joanna hes a rocket down the lane Joanna will scoop that lay it out what a half the speed of NC State they are getting the ball down court so quickly and they put a ton of pressure on Virginia Techs transition defense but you hesitate for a second as bazilly did going up for that shot and dewana knocks it away but just cant buy one in and out on that long range shot 4926 under 90 seconds to go in the half wolf pack just rocking and rolling Joyner couldnt handle that one and out it goes but they havent made many mistakes Applause just a great recovery by Juana coming all the way from the top of the key and as soon as he blocks it it is just a oneman fast break but Moana did not quit on the play got all the way back after blocking that shot and then got the stick back the tour for mutts a dribble down knocked away in a whistle with 105 left in the half even on that dive to the basket by Justin mutts Greg Gantt was right there its been an active help side defense theyre moving as the ball moves and the pressure on the ball has been excellent theres been a number of deflections steals everythings challenged again with a personal mutts to the line so it admitted four left in the half NC State with a basketball and pressing 50 points here their offense has been high octane all season long averaging 78 points a game this is another level above that tonight no question I mean this has to be if not the highest scoring first half in ACC play its challenging for it Applause Joyner on the pullup pop the follow up and in and they are relentless on that glass that was Gant making it a 10nothing run sharkell Joyner so good at snaking off those ball screens he can split Defenders pull up boy thats so the jobs not done once the shot goes up I mean maybe maybe there wasnt defensive rebound because everythings been going in what a patch whipped ahead and Joyner with the Finish wow man down on the other end thats Gantz Greg Gantt for the wolf pack in some pain with 181 seconds before the break and the trainers out to attend to Greg 6A Junior hes out of Fayetteville North Carolina and the play continued on without him and a lightning strike for the wolf pack to lead it 5326 and well look for the replay it looks like exactly what happened looked like his knee got twisted up here yeah I got all got stepped on by Justin mutts and that that is an awkward angle that right leg is inadvertently stepped right on his right foot Applause its nice that people can get along isnt it yes it is awfully sweet and a nice hand for Greg here in the building but hobbling off its good to see him just walking under his own power that was that was not an attractive happening so Ernest Ross 69 sophomore in for Gantt hes going to make his way toward the tunnel and the locker room here just before halftime 5326 NC State rocking and rolling here in the first 20 Applause and the Hokies recover Doula no and thats it for the half biggest halftime deficit of the season for the Hokies NC State certainly earned that 5326 at the break NC State was good in every area of play better than good Firepower we saw from NC State was how well they played on the defensive end and you know NC State you take a look at that shot chart those Os might be a little too close than the actual shots I mean they were 63 percent in that first half seven of 13 from three and Joyner and Smith combined for 33 points in that first half just a fantastic half Burns was in foul trouble in first half hes going to draw a foul here lets go to Holly Virginia Tech coach Mike young said you know Ive been a lot better than this stuff hes always such a goodnatured man but he said were just not getting to them their ball screen coverage is excellent right now and those are big league guards were just not connected enough defensively and were not making it difficult it is essential we get to them better dont give them so much space and he said I promise were going to do a better job here in the second half well one of those big league guards hits again Smiths had a terrific game NC State closed the half on a 172 run they got serious and you know youre hitting floaters Runners threes step backs you name it and then Ebenezer Joanna is the first half was fantastic I love saying Ebenezer oh me too he had a career high 11 points he blocked a couple shots and because of his play Virginia Tech was Scrooge get it nicely done its fun to say not just at Christmas time five 28 itll be basily at the line Music drew two Defenders anytime you help up which Jack Clark did there youre gonna have an opening but thats been few and far between in this game for Virginia Tech just its been so difficult against NC States defense to get any openings and in that first half Sean Padula and Hunter Couture combined for one of 11 from the field Joyner shredding to D with that hand left hand cant get it to roll in the tour with only two points Miss and the dunk by a must on the nice follow he has eight and I like Hunter Couture letting that fly in transition you can get a better shot against NC State early than you can trying to grind it out because their their defense has been excellent their help side and switches have been Timely Applause cell thinking about it shot clock down to six and Couture with a rebound and the Hokies are a quality opponent they won 19 games mutts will line up the long one not there for him Applause but the wolf pack in the first half of times are just playing with them isnt a tiptoeing through and he converts how many steps does he get I mean theres no way you can guard him if he gets three steps he is 23 nine out of 11 shooting is really trying to get positioned behind Burns he did and hell lay it in what a pass Casey Marcel was switched off onto Grampa zilli just fronted him and you know you just when youre smaller you just front and fight and thats exactly what he did what a move oh and what a shot too by the big guy Burns light on those feet he doesnt look like he should be able to do that but you watch it on film you watch him in person his feet are fantastic swished in and a threepoint answer by Padula been pretty quiet in this one with six points NC State just giving Virginia Tech a little more space in the second half than they did in the first Joyner loses the dribble burns on bazilly mutz is coming good pass Clark will drive it and back into boy thats how to play out of a double team that will hook pass to Marcel gets it into the corner and the shot fake and drive from Jack Clark that was really pretty his first basket whats inside but the Hokies right now are just trading baskets they are and its awfully difficult to win that way but at least offensively what Virginia Tech is doing is getting the ball down Court quickly and trying to strike early no they need some stops easier said than done and bodying up his bazilly trying to chase down Smith hell commit the personal his third DJ Burns is a lefty and catches it on the left side of the floor makes a move just a spin little drop step to the basket one two three four thats thats hard to guard 16 20 to go I can stay with him for three steps not four black to the paint Scoops it in thats a pretty play Applause Jack Clark transferred in from LaSalle double digit score there hes a good rebounder versatile skilled and hes another guy that gets deflections out there yeah hes long Colin Zips it here to bazilly kind of inch a little bit closer Collins some quick dribbling cant convert it though nice job by Marcel to get late pressure on that shot Joy knew to push it out quickly thinking the same thing they are lightning fast you have to get back on the Wolfpack but youre dead Burns muscle in his way threw it away Collins with the pick leading the charge here for Couture the tour going in strong in the bank well that was a strong move tour gives that a little shot fake and its not a violent fake but its so effective because his credibility as a shooter so good Clark lines it up and it rattles in from threepoint land what do you do I mean you stay with Joyner put two on the ball and then Jack Clark just a little pick and pop and drills a three on you then the story of the night wolf pack hitting from way downtown over and over and over again and just thrown away by Padula there was nobody home theyve turned it over eight times in this one 6640 all wolf pack so far tonight up next deliwich from Hot Pocket womens day and how better to celebrate than showcasing the best women in the ACC winning the ACC tournament for the first time in full history and of course we are here with those incredible women the ACC Player of the Year Liz kitley and her bad you know what guard George I almost are on national TV sorry about that you guys have been so great for so long twotime ACC Player of the Year how have you been able to really elevate your game um I will attribute that to my coach coach Kenny Brooks um he spent a lot of time and effort into me to make me better and probably hundreds of individuals over the last few years so I will attribute it to that do you guys have time off the election Sunday is coming up where are you excited to go and what are you hoping to accomplish Georgia at this point Im ready to play anywhere and against anyone I love March its my favorite favorite time of the year so Im just ready to see where we go who we have on Sunday you guys are here trying to encourage the men what do you think right now about the game stuff is crazy but NC States offense has been really good so credit to them all right well thank you so much International Day of the women and I could not have picked you more incredible women to be celebrating with thank you Bob so much love that response too you know when youre you asked where do you want to go where do you want to play in the term Ill go anywhere Ill play anybody anytime anytime and Liz kitley the twotime ACC player of the year so its kind of depressing but I played against her dad Ralph kitley played at Wake Forest I actually actually was one of the hosts of Ralph kitley when he visited Duke and after a weekend with me he decided anywhere but here so he went to Wake Forest to do a little foul a moment ago Clark taking the Baseline on another Nifty move you give him nine which is so difficult to guard NC State because the floor is so spread and that opens up driving lanes and Jack Clark taking advantage of it in the second half much to the paint and one they need a lot more of that Justin mutts a 67 seed here from New Jersey with the basket and hes got a dozen got injured earlier and here he is on crutches that is not good to see hes got his first start of the year against Duke back in January and he is an important piece of this NC State puzzle with his ability to guard and rebound yeah good passer too 6845 the pack dominating effort so far here tonight much like North Carolina against Boston College where cell from the corner shorts threepointer has been a huge part of the attack they are eight out of 16 mutts went all the way in for two NC State just not stopping the ball first seven minutes of the second half but theyve got such a big lead now four different NC State Shooters have hit a threepointer tonight so to your point who do you guard up and they get it to go there jump in front of the roller tag Dewan as he rolls to the basket and that opened up a offensive rebound Lane for Casey Marcel and you give NC State Credit I think they dont quit on any play mutts around the back gets kicked right to kid into the paint literally kicked how many deflections has NC State had tonight they got they always have a goal of 40 Kevin Keats is a Rick Pitino guy and thats that was a big stat for Rick Pacinos getting deflections shows how active your defense is and you know if you chart it you can coach it you and I were chatting before the game as Couture gets two about the difference from when you played in this tournament at Duke years ago and players today playing you know three or four consecutive days I mean players today have the ability because you know the training methods medicine everything have come so far thats going to go the other way the players feel so much pressure than 20 30 years ago well the technology with rest and recovery and all the all the players wear monitors of of all their vitals so they know exactly what to get them as far as their hydration nutrition is so much better back in the day they gave us a slice of pizza and so get some rest I mean its so different now but these players have to do more too I mean theyre theyre you know for a big guy now you know back in the 80s you know before you have to as a big guy you had to wrestle your guy for a position at the free throw line on down these guys are guarding three four ball screens of possession its amazing the activity level yeah that recovery Begins the moment they leave the floor mine begins in the bar ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is brought to you by principal when you take care of your team they take care of business foreign 7049 the Wolfpack impressive here this evening in Greensboro 11 49 Applause jarkel Joyner trying to get the ball being guarded by Sean Padula he has been spectacular in this game not only his scoring but hes got nine assists not a single turnover only turns it over about 10 times a game anyway very stingy Joyner looking to make a move here on padulo shot clock to 10 Applause swing it up here for Smith he cashes in hes done that all night just a great play by Joyner to get into the lane and then that extra pass which was the right pass got a wide open look for uh turkey on Smith its been a clinic offensively for NC State he is 26 Padula with an answer here as he drops into triple nine points for Sean tonight you have to chase him off of those screens you cant go underneath because hell just stop and pop games like tonight just a reminder of how amazing the Hokies run was last year in this tournament felt like it came out of nowhere on the drive the script shot by Joyner and that was a 30foot drive by jarkel Joyner yeah but that run last year I mean that Kevin Aluma who started out at Wofford where Mike young was the coach had some great teams with Fletcher McGee and then one of the great names in college basketball storm Murphy yes that is a that is a future meteorologist storm Murphy If Ever I heard coming up next the weather with storm Murphy its gonna name other meteorologists change their name too 2313 last year won the ACC tournament title for the first time a scintillating run no buzzer beaters last second shots great performances those dont come around very often though Padula on Joyner he just got too far underneath Applause and up ahead swatted Away by much but theyre going to convert that Smith Johnny on the spot is 28 another play where NC State didnt give up on the play ground Smith did not just assume that that bucket was going to be made months with a short one left is short who was the meteorologist you grew up with you remember Bruce schweigler schwegler is not a see I grew up with Johnny mountain and then I live in Charlotte now where Larry Sprinkle Applause now he changed that to sprinkle no way sure he did theres a long line of sprinkles that were great on the weather Joyner shredded everybody and a whistle here in the pay those with five on the shot clock and back to as you say not give it up well again the speed of darkell Joyner had some choices here but Mr Clay Dan Smith just kept going right down the middle of the Court just ran the pipe I cant believe you think Larry Sprinkle changed his name hes not an Entertainer hes a professional I cant believe you didnt blink when I said schwagler thats the heat changed his name just to make it easy for everyone to pronounce he probably came from the sprinkle family and just couldnt take it I think youre probably right its a long line of sprinkles Joyner at 85 percent at the foul line one of the best foul Shooters in the conference as far as you know the sprinkle family theyre in the donut business and Larry just broke away no future on it you enter to the bench and pressure here from NC State leading 7952 Music huge first half with a wolf pack and theyve kept on keeping on Couture cant bury it rebound tip theyll stay on this end Applause you know the huge news coming out of Greensboro today was at the end of the Syracuse loss to Wake Forest Jim Boeheim gave a fascinating couple of answers that were hard to decipher during the press conference whether or not he had retired he said he had actually as Couture drills that he said I had actually given my going away speech my retirement speech but everybody missed it and then about an hour and a half after that the university announced that was the end for Jim Boeheim it had to be a little cryptic as a retirement speech if everybody missed it right yeah how did everybody get that wrong but one of the great coaches in the history of sport not just the history of basketball and with over a thousand wins its actually over 1100 they need to give him that hundred and some back I would agree with that yeah but national championship of course and incredible success in a place where that was never a given I mean to attract the caliber of players over the years and the teams that he did to play at Syracuse and Im a Syracuse guy and I can tell you what its like in the wintertime there to have those guys come year after year to Jim recruit the way he did and make them the teams they were I thought that was amazing absolutely amazing and uh already a member for the last couple of decades in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and hes in a number of Halls of Fame just an amazing career but it is over at Syracuse thought we might never hear that shot clock down to five and knocked in again this time from the wing and everybody in on the ACT for the wolf pack tonight the brown pass is a he was a high school football player but can use either hand around the basket good Defender and NC States death is impressive they can keep fresh bodies out there they played Joyner and Smith a lot but they Kevin Keats can go to that bench and keep some fresh bodies coming at you throughout the 40 minutes NC State pick to finish 10th in the preseason ACC poll they have proven to be a whole lot better than that Applause just the improvement from last year to this and sir clavion Smith and then adding in what a great pickup jarkel Joyner was from Ole Miss Ile lets fly not there for him nice spin move by Ross but gives it right back the long one Switched in by Rodney rice Rodney rice is a good talent hes going to be a really good player out of DeMatha High School had an injury this year what his first game back was against Syracuse sometimes thats not the most fun to have to be thrown into it against that Syracuse Zone Applause ass from the corner got another one on the water triple they have been reigning threepointers in a Coliseum tonight and they have come from everywhere theres not a spot on the floor where NCD NC state has a drilled to three and the answer by rice but 10 out of 19 for the wolf pack from threepoint distance Rodney rise is a bucket getter but he had a clutch three late against Notre Dame that was a huge shot whistle stops the clock foul is 6 45 remaining NC State actually 11 out of 20 Sonic has treats under two rates of NC State its hard to believe its been 40 years since they won that National Championship but Thoreau Bailey one of the leading scorers on that team told us he sees some real similarities about whats going on now at NC state has the potential to do some great things the person and we got a chance to talk to those guys a little bit about what it takes first of all theyve got to be tight tough things they went through doing a great pushing to win thats called who used to say NC State brought all of the living members of that organization backed its 40year anniversary they were back on campus two weeks ago and they did get to talk to this team and and share their experiences share what it took and thurl Bailey said hes been very impressed by what hes seen there really likes the coach really likes this young team and makes me feel old that that was very special that we get to memorialize it so if youre not alone on that one Holly hard to believe I mean I look at David Thompson and think I used to have a David Thompson poster on my wall when I was a kid one of my alltime favorite players had him up there at Marcus Johnson on there yeah that old Adidas poster Marcus Johnson David Thompson wasnt just one of the greats in NC State history he may be the greatest player ever in the ACC I mean the Skywalker was something else and sadly because of the rule that the NCAA put in when Lou Alcindor now Kareem AbdulJabbar went to UCLA they put in that note dunk wall can you imagine the Highlight I mean David Thompson put off highlights anyway right but could you imagine what he would have done if he could dunk the ball in college what a huge mistake that was by the NCAA but thurl Bailey was a great player he was a senior when I was a freshman I had to guard him a few times and it was not pleasant he is not only a great player but one of the nicest human beings youve ever met in your life its interesting you can watch a clip like that you can tell if youve never met him well Phillips 66 Big 12 mens championship bracket now the Big 12 roundly considered the best league in all the college basketball led by a number one Kansas theyve got West Virginia tomorrow three oclock at ESPN well West Virginia has played really well especially of late and its a team that actually usually theyre theyre known for their defense and rebounding theyre actually better offensively this year than defensively and Eric Stevenson has been fantastic hes the seeds he has coming out of the Big 12 and hes got Oklahoma State as a first four outs Kansas can lose their first game and get shut out and theyre still a number one seed in the NCAA tournament theyve won so many quality games but that thats a league that just has no bottom its amazing just how good that league is top to bottom hes foul number four on DJ Burns and well put Poteet to the line from the rice transfer now that 83 NC State team the champions that Holly was talking about you know that reunion they had Terry Gannon was back and Derek Wittenberg Sidney Lowe Ernie Myers Roselle McQueen and I think Terry Gann is still upset that when Derek Wittenberg put up that shot that Lorenzo Charles dunked in to win the championship he was wide open on the right wing and Wittenberg didnt even look I think still calls it a pass with Justin Gainey recently hes on Rick Barnes staff and Justin gave his sons a really good player by the way but Justin was talking about you know being on the list of the alltime great NC State point guards and were talking about them and I was thinking okay Derek Wittenberg would be upset if he wasnt on this list even though he was a two guard and then I thought well Derek Wittenberg would say he was the best center NC States ever had hes the best power forward NC States ever has a small forward face turn around and a shot by Joyner and they just keep on coming hes got 20 Ian Smith have been putting on a show Joyner as much passing the basketball tonight as anyone jarkel joyners been magnificent all game long thats going to be an and one Boutique slow to get up but made the basket obviously on the dunk youll be at the line Smith by the way with 30 points now look gannons wide open didnt even look at him wide open it worked out pretty well and Wittenberg still insists that was a pass and hes petitioned the NCAA to give him an assist on that play even though it was an offensive rebound you know you see the celebration and Jimmy V racing around looking for someone to hugging all that dont forget what a Monumental upset that was a staggering upset I dont think anybody outside of the NC State family thought that the wolf pack was going to win that game I mean theyre going against Clyde Drexler and Hakeem Olajuwon Michael young Larry Michelle I mean they were unbelievably good sure were Benny Anders thats semifinal game between Houston and Louisville you know Louisville back then they were called the doctors of dunk Ed by Danny Crum I mean it must have been 20 dunks in that game why do we love sports why do we love basketball its games like that passed right on cannot hit that one but a whistle with four 54 to go and these wolf pack fans in attendance in Greensboro they just want to celebrate tonight so late evening as it is laying their way on into the quarterfinals Tawana picks up foul number three and to the other hand itll be bazilly shoot where he makes 70 percent hes been playing exceptionally well here over the last month month and a half for Mike Young Music Casey Marcel about to come back to the four for Kevin Keats no one point late in the season for the first time since 1982 NC State was ranked in the top 25 in both North Carolina and Duke were not the first time NC State had been in the AP poll since January of 2019 top 25 at this point heres Smith 30point game for him black steps back well when NC State plays with the kind of defensive intensity they played with in the first half this team is going to be really hard to beat for anybody nice with an air ball Music Applause and 422 showing you think about Virginia Tech this team was 111 before Hunter Couture got injured with that I think its a lower arm elbow whatever it was but when he went out that sort of stopped the momentum of this team then Grant basily really came on but you think about what might have been had Couture been healthy all year long and he is able to return as Clark misfires but a whistle on this with a covert year he has not said if hes going to take that or not and come back to Blacksburg I remember when Mike young first got the job coming from Wofford to Virginia Tech theyre playing in the Maui Invitational and I had not seen Hunter Couture play and he had recruited him at Wofford and I said uh you know what do you think of Couture and he said he can play Anywhere and its come so far as a Defender hes an excellent Defender and you know Mike likes to joke that when he first got the Virginia Tech he couldnt guard Mike young I think he could have but that was probably a little bit of an overstatement hes a really good Defender one of the smartest players in the college game over a thousand career points that was there on Senior Day in Blacksburg and he was honored his mom and dad had a great video talking about many of the things you just discussed but well see if that video proves to be true in the entity in fact is going to hang it up as a college player or return the Doula going around the back he gave it away Joyner Joyner on the feed for Clark and hell step it all double digit assists for jarkel Joyner he has done everything in this game 20 points 10 assists for him under three rice cant hit Poteet will send it back out hell try it again and he hit that one shot both those from the exact same spot Applause but too little too late although he has 11 two and a half to play Applause NC State intelligently going to use every second of the clock before they get into something Joyner kicks it out interrupted by rice so itll be NC State ball Music back had dropped four out of seven coming into Greensboro but looking great tonight ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is brought to you by New York Life over 12 000 agents there to help guide you through lifes happiest and most difficult times Music Northern Arizona looking to take down top seed of Montana state in the Big Sky title game northern Arizonas only seven division one regular season wins and only 40 minutes away from an NCAA berth tell you what guys I did not Envision looking up as Larry Sprinkle reel when I started my day today sprinkle reel well just ask Jay billis real as rain eight seconds on the shot clock he could always go back to LA Dallas rains can give you the weather in addition to Johnny mountain and thats for real heres Purcell around and out with a triple has played a terrific game come on out of nowhere tonight 611 Junior under two minutes to play Thomas Jr rattles it in thats a nice move under control gave a little shot fake got the defender off the floor Applause Smith and Joyner for the wolf pack have combined for 50 points 15 rebounds 13 assists and one turnover really a fabulous performance by the NC State guards really everybody for NC State contributed but in the first half as impressive as the shot making and that was impressive I mean its like a video game the defensive effort was what I thought started everything it was such intensity on the defensive level or on the defensive end and Virginia Tech couldnt run anything in the first half no it was suffocated were selling company about to celebrate this one their fans are already getting into it shot clock will expire here good a minute 19 to go and so it is on to the quarterfinals that field is set the quarterfinals will get underway at noon tomorrow Day games at noon and 2 30 and the night games at seven and nine thirty well I think with one exception maybe it was the 89 game all the top seeds have held havent they that is correct one thing that will be interesting for the wolf pack a little bit worrisome is Greg Gantz thats the downer of this to have such a great performance and then you know Greg Gantt was leaving on crutches and you certainly hope its nothing season ending Ross kind of tipped on his way to drop into and up to 95 points for the wolf back under a minute to go Applause so winding up with a couple of blowouts here in the night sessions that one rattles home Applause and thats 17 for him but hes got a lot of offensive game hes going to be a really good player hes good now but hes going to be really good guys with a step back and round it up and stuffed in Earnest Ross with a highlight at the very end of the game 69 sophomore getting up there Poteet hell draw the foul with about 25 seconds to go late in the game theres a nice little step back but nobody lays the body on Ernest Ross and Above the Rim finish for the sophomore from Florida Music coach Keiths going strong to his bench now in the last seconds Applause she stayed from the opening tip really control this game in impressive fashion kind of shot the lights off for most of it Applause got a great performance from their backcourt Not For the First Time certainly this season and it wont be the last those guys can light it up now KJ Keats of a 510 freshman son of head coach Kevin Keats is into the ball game Wolfpack had a 27point lead at halftime theyd already set that pace to score 100 points at 97 here and I know theyre supposed to dribble out the clock but when everybody gets into the game youd rather see him just play it man stop with you let him roll let them play take a 25footer thatll work all this time to dribble out the clock she stayed rocking and rolling here tonight Greensboro impressive from tap to buzzer by NC State dominant on both ends of the floor so Clemson is next the number three seed North Carolina Big Win earlier as well against Boston College
