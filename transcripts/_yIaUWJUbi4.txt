they want to get back to that stany defense they had during the winning streak setting it underway Jamie lucky Matt Potter Tony chazza are officials here in Charlottesville and we are underway as North Carolina wins the opening tip number 10 in the country coming in theyve been a very good road team to the six and two on the road in conference play RJ Davis gets the first crack at it but off Target the rebound is picked off by Ryan dun who just might wind up the defensive player of the year but hes got great competition on his own team with Reese beakman he absolutely does that and ran dun who leads the ACC in blocks of course Reese bman in steals so both those guys have the characteristics to get it done as ACC Player of the Year bman trying to penetrate and pop and hits the first bucket of the afternoon I love the aggressive Movement by Reese beakman to get into the painted area using his size over RJ Davis thats something that Virginias guards with that size Advantage can do B out of the double Ingram will Slither in and hit that shot nice give there from B and OB youve got to consider the fact that not only is this armo bops fifth year but this is about the 10th or 11th time hes played against Virginia so hes very aware of that post trap in North Carolina prepared on that first possession hes had a lot of injuries when hes taken on Virginia had one monster game where had 29 and 22 yeah big performance but of course this a school and well talk more about it that Amando Bott absolutely considered when he came out of high school D makes a strong move cant finish it thats a problem for him not a lot of offense despite all the great defense could owe it a kick here cormack Ryan will finish that with a triple from the corner cormack Ryan has hit four threepointers in the last two games respectively shooting the basketball extremely well 50 over those last two games from Beyond The Applause Arc pman will back it away Virginia 14 one at John Paul Jones Arena and hell get two more hes off to a quick fourpoint start but thats it once again Reese beakman using his size over RJ Davis just getting into the painted area and using that 63 frame to shoot over the top of this Mara Davis Eli Canó The Freshman point guard looking in Bott trying to get clear hell spin to the Baseline and a shove as hes fouled right there on the Baseline with eight on a shot clock and followed by Jordan Miner great battle between the two bests from the guard position in the ACC Reese beakman attacking RJ Davis off the bounce doesnt beat him initially but backs him down using that size to score over the top we can expect to see a lot of that from Reese bman throughout this game Ryan off the inbounds big rebound by Bott and a monstrous return and that is the problem for Virginia Virginia has given up over 10 offensive rebounds 10 times this season Armando Bott one of the best the ACC has ever seen on the offensive glass theyve got to find a way to keep a body on him hes coming off a tremendous game against Virginia Tech 25 and 12 roie gets a good clean look that clangs away rebound spun to Miner and thatll roll off the 10 Jordan Miner everything that could have gone right until the shot and K backs it away bayot up high this time well see how dominating Bott will be today hes been in and out in that category this season when hes been good hes been very good Ryan with a shot clock out to eight RJ Davis now the player of the year candidate in the conference he heaves a long one and cant hit strong defensive stand by Virginia on that possession not only coming up with the stop but also forcing North Carolina to use a entire shot clock to get what was a contested look done on a perimeter heres mcne might be the key to the whole thing today for Virginia if hes PA beyond that threepoint line where hes 46 the first one wont go I agree with you Obie I believe McNeely will have a lot to say about this one Virginia needs that threepoint shooting to be successful bacock somehow got the pass to Ryan along the Baseline Carolina three for six out of the gate Virginia two for six strong drive kdo all the way through nobody picked him up and he lays it in ell only gets about eight points a game but hes open because of so much attention being paid to Armando Bott both Defenders actually staying back with Bott not knowing whether to switch or to hedge that screen roll action caught in the middle giving up an easy layup Huber Davis going to go to his bench and bring on a couple of guys in a moment as done is shorts rebound coming free but there is a whistle another foul against Virginia and the crowd doesnt like that very much but a personal against the Cavaliers 1533 to go as we hit our first media break today North Carolina with a fivepoint lead on the Cavs the biggest problem with that last possession for Virginia it results in a foul for Ryan Dunn Ryan Dunn picked up two fouls in the first half against Virginia Tech on Monday night and had to spend a lot of time in that first half on the bench then you can ill afford to have Ryan Dunn on the bench especially when his matchup is Harrison Ingram who may absolutely be the best X Factor in the ACC now Virginia of course one of the great defensive teams in the country nothing new there theyre number three 59 points a game against them so very very tough to score although Virginia Tech was able to get behind their defense to get some relatively easy baskets which was a shocker in blackburg to see anybody do that against Virginia and Tony Bennett told us playing his day we got dominated on the interior by Virginia Tech their bigs did a number on us ly kid had 14 points in the first half coming up with deflections running the floor dunking the basketball Tyler niichel had 13 points and six assists First Virginia Tony benett had no answers for the hokes in blackburg on Monday night but its been a long week for the whoos to recover and Tony Bennett said they have used that in the most constructive manner they possibly can to prepare for this game here understanding the importance of this one so a 94 lead here for North Carolina and everybody in the building awaiting the result of Wake Forest and Duke and what was an absolute barn burner going down the stretch Hunter Salis had a big big game with 29 Points and wake four stays under defeated at home on the Music season so that game is over Wake Forest has knocked off the Duke Blue Music Devils and theres an injury at the very end of that game so its a fascinating way for the day to unravel because if North Carolina wins this game give effect ducas law North Carolina will have a couple games clear inside the ACC at the top of the league and we welcome you to our ACC and ESPN Blockbuster today from Charlottesville Virginia number 10 North Carolina taken out of Virginia Cavaliers a Sonic Blockbuster and a Dandy here today North Carolina at 20 and6 Virginia at 207 and for those just tuning in nationally North Carolina has not won here in almost exactly 12 years Cory Alexander and OB in those games when you consider what has happened in this building for North Carolina they have only averaged 54 points a game on this floor Hubert Davis told us hes never won here as a coach and that means during his time as an assistant for Roy Williams or as a head coach hes never W in this building and right now off to a great start for the tar Hills led by RJ Davis 21 points a game a look at their starting lineup its brought to you by degree Davis leading the ACC Ingram Bott and Ryan all get double figures and thats going to be a turnover but North Carolina needs their defense cor to step up really fire up again the way they were about a month ago they absolutely do during the month of January there was a 10 game winning streak that started in the end of December when North Carolina was the best defensive team in the ACC only allowing their opponents 30 65 field goals and less than 30 from Beyond to three they have to get back to those winning ways to finish up this ACC season strong Jak gr slamming on a break shot clock down to five here does MC see it hes going to drive the Baseline go for the reverse B was there to cover and Virginia has missed five consecutive shots after a pretty quick start and when Armand Bott has Jake Groves on his back he should get the basketball missed opportunity for North Carolina on that possession its going to be difficult enough for Blake Buchanan to defend bot but thats a possession where he should have got the basketball Virginia just the one loss here on their home floor at John Paul Jones Arena theyre 14 and one the only stumble against pit beakman will lean in but miss it he hit his first couple of shots today well Virginia theyre going to have to have a steady diet of that Rees beakman getting into the painted area trying to score hes going to have to be aggressive and putting points on the board for the hoos set tremble up top for Davis shooting 41 beyond the threepoint line hes had a tremendous season at 36 against wake T night there as they Converge on him and Trigger the break to bman who will scoop it up and cannot finish with the accs leading shot blocker getting a stop on one end of the four however Virginia unable to finish it up on the other end engram cant connect rebound pops free but a foul here against Carolina Virginia 0 for seven as we give you a look at the standings now up to the minute given the Duke defeat at the hands of Wake Forest Hunter Salis a big game today leading the way for Wake so theres Duke slipping behind a little bit thats a half game at the moment pending the outcome of this one and Armando Bott very fortunate on that possession had a little was a little too excited in his conversation with Jamie lucky after picking up that foul Jamie lucky stayed poised and just stay teared down Bott as Bott walked away fortunate to not have a technical foul issue to him on that possession on top of the foul Groves gives it up here for beakman Groves on the spin airborne and a stop there by Seth tremble Seth tremble one of the better defenders in the ACC right now coming into guard Rees beakman however got switched off on Jacob Gro did a great job on the post in that possession North Carolina looking for win number 21 64th time theyve won 20 thats the most in the ACC Duke is second with 58 Davis shot clock to five Trimble gets a look at it he drives it leans right in and stop Buchanan able to get it up there off the fingertips great job defensively by Buchanan denying that opportunity recognizing the shot clock wearing down back to Buchanan he stumbles bot colliding with him and thats going to be the second foul on Armond Bott 1239 remaining in the first half as you see Blake Buchanan coming up with the block shot keeping it in bounds and starting the offense for Virginia as Bott picks up that second foul going to be interesting to see how Hubert Davis plays this does he keep Bott on the bench for the remainder of this half or trust his 50year senior to be able to come back and play Spot minutes to the bench he goes 1239 to go in the half arando who has scuffled with that throughout his career the 611 gr out of Richmond Virginia hitting the bench with a couple Tony Bennett matching Hubert Davis as RJ Davis and Armando Bott go out Rees beakman and Ryan Dunn also exit the game so Tony Bennett going to take this time to get his guys some rest mcne cant get the shot buan will try and missfire North Carolina the top rebounding team in the ACC also the top scoring team neither team has scored in over 3 minutes of this game we went to our first media break with 15 half remaining at 94 and the score Remains the Same jayen Washington got it back cant hit it though so theres a lid on both baskets here in Charlottesville North Carolina again has never lost this many games on an opponents floor in a row ever around it up and another rebound for the heels well coming into this game youre expecting a lowscoring game thats the way these games are play between Virginia and North Carolina however weve seen guys missing easy shots that youve expected to see them make throughout this game throws with the foul on the Baseline 1137 left as we take a timeout ACC leading the way more on that when we come back here very good basketball coaches leading great basketball programs OB you and I did a game in North Carolina on Martin Luther King birthday weekend and we had two black coaches Hubert Davis and red archery from Syracuse and the best thing about that entire thing in my opinion was the fact that you didnt even recognize the fact that it was two black coaches until I mentioned it to you indeed kind of about time you know yeah and it really is about time but you know one of the things Ive always loved about this conference is that we always been at the Forefront in diversity and inclusion the ACC by having 60 of his head coaches who just happen to be black but the more that we dont talk about it and the more that it becomes common place I think is where were getting to where Martin Luther Kings dream actually was here here North Carolina with 124 lead Armond Bott in a little foul trouble he just passed 13th Place on the NCAA alltime rebounding list passing Bill Russell 1607 in rebounds for Armando North Carolina with a basketball trying to build on this advantage against Virginia vgia Virginia has a very difficult time coming back on anybody when they get down by significant numbers Ingram lost it a sprawling attempt by Murray to keep it alive and will itll be Virginia ball and guys diving on the floor OB this is an important game of course for both of these teams and you see tame Murray getting on the floor after Dante Harris comes up with the strip but how about Harrison Ingram flying in knocking out of bounds not allowing Virginia to be able to take advantage of the live ball turnover those are the type of plays that Harrison Ingram has made for this team all season long maybe the most versatile player in the ACC and absolutely a huge X Factor for North Carolina stford transfer been a grand slam for hubt Applause Davis long drought here Court Virginia and on that shot theyre not going to bust it and an official timeout here by Jamie lucky with five on the shot clock officials get together that shot clock should reset that basketball hit the rim Jamie lucky going to go over and talk to the team talk to the scores table about resetting it to 20 seconds a Sonic Blockbuster match up here so somethings got to give an outstanding offensive team against a great defensive team I think the difference this year in this matchup because the game is going to be played in a pace where North Carolina will be fortunate to get into the 60s the difference is North Carolina has been a better defensive team this season than they have in the past when theyve come into this building that is their advantage Bean with the g and an emphatic Slam by Buchanan to finally end that drought Virginia has that happened quite a bit this was 7 and 50 seconds 7 minutes and 50 seconds and OB all three Virginia baskets have either been scored or assisted by reys beakman Virginia cannot win if he has to do everything for them in this game theyve got to find someone else to help them on the offensive end but ree beakman on the Move doing a great job once again getting into the painted area drawing the shot blocker and Washington dumping it off as Bak New Cannon finishes strong with the two Hand flush bigman number one in the conference in assist per game hes number two in steals roie and hes going to be walking with it a travel in the lane to give it back to North Carolina Carolina playing for the first time in a week its their longest break since games around Christmas last Saturday an impressive win over Virginia Tech got 25 and 12 from bot 17 rebounds from egram and Airs the rejection High out of the sky by gross and they turn it into points bigman on Davis and Davis is going to pick up the personal but back to the block shot Virginia doing the job defensively great job by Jake Groves getting over denying that opportunity Elliot CAD with a burst of speed getting into the paint and Dante Harris does a great job of tight roping the Baseline you see grow with a huge block but even as impressive as Harris tracks it down he tight ropes the Baseline to keep it in bounds Ro from the corner no lets see if Davis starts to get rolling hes been pretty quiet so far Cory well hes been quiet because hes got the AC accs ring Defensive Player of the Year guarding him and its tough to go and get Buckets against Reese beakman but one of the things that Hubert Davis talked to us about was during this long week they were able to get back to practicing on themselves sick pass and by doing so a lot of that has to do with their defensive effort a very lowscoring first half to at this point coming up weve got Texas and Kansas followed by Texas AM and Tennessee a day and night chock full of college basketball here on ESPN in our family of Applause networks n the team lights out North Carolina 5 for 15 Virginia three for 18 and thatll spin out by Ryan to this point cor M Ryans two threepointers have been the Difference Maker thus far in this game with a sixpoint lead for North Carolina got a good look on that possession unable to get it to go beakman on the dribble leaning in thats going to be blocked big defensive play by Jaylen Washington CAD on the other end gets two and he earned those and we ask youber Davis do you want to continue to push the tempo against this team he said absolutely thats who we are were not going to get away from our characteristics but they have to get good shots that was a great shot BYO a pop around it up bes gone cold after Good Start Virginia has six points with eight minutes to go in the first half and its been all about ree beak with the two buckets in the painted area and driving and dishing as quarterback cant lines up another three unable to get it to go but hes getting good looks against this Virginia Defense and one of the ways you have to beat Virginia youre going to have to do it against this pack line from Beyond the threepoint AR the boun for Buchanan Buchanan gets a look off the back of the iron Virginia absolutely stone cold if youre just tuning in Duke is already lost today and a terrific game played by Wake Forest that game came right down to the final couple of possession shot clock down to eight they catch made by Washington got in close hell draw the foul as Buchan went for the block and the big freshman fouled him North kada wants to run they want to push the pace control the tempo difficult to do against Virginia however Elliot kadoo taking it from point A to point B as fast as you can the Finish over Groves for this of Virginia they need a break to grab something to make him feel better theyre three for 20 one from the field 0 for three from three they have only one assist in the game to this point I realize thats the way Virginia often not maybe not this badly shooting the ball but theyre not an offensive Juggernaut but this is tough for their fans to watch well no I I wouldnt say that for their fans its simply about winning thats the most important part for the Virginia fans they dont care if its 40 to 39 as long as you win they have learned to embrace the pace in Charlottesville that is the motto here regardless as the point the the scoring its always about having at least one more Point than the opponent the issue right now is the fact that North Carolina has 14 points and theyve been able to do this with RJ Davis not able to get going and Amando Bott on the bench with those two fouls all you didnt say it youre in a lump Ill say well I mean again I mean beauty is in the eye of the beholder I hear there there are many people here that love to watch this style of play and to be able to beat North Carolina which Virginia has done eight consecutive times on this floor no basket there cornack Ryan committing the foul and also to be able to compete with the Duke Blue Devils of the world in this league Tony Bennett bought a program here that is that plays a certain way and this the way they have to play because youre not going to go and get the McDonalds all Americans they they dont want to play This Way Cory they dont want to shoot three for 21 no no do that its not about the shooting three for 21 its about the pace of the game of course everyone would love to make every shot they take well it made one in the last 11 minutes youve got to do better than that I agree with that wholeheartly Obie but what Im saying is this is the pace of the game the Virginia wants to play theyre trying to find someone that gives them some type of punch offensively but more importantly theyve held a team that averages 83 points a game to 15 points after playing 13 minutes that is working for Virginia thats the other side of the Clover I get that theyve played good defense and theyre still in the game but somebodys got shot get 6 and half minutes to go you have six points in the first half kadoo gives it up getting it back shot clock getting inside two and swished in by corack Ryan hes been the difference OB hes made three threepoint field goals in this first half nine of North Carolinas 18 points for Virginia were asking whos going to step up outside of Reese beakman well with RJ d struggling as well as Armando Bott on the bench corack Ryans been that guy for Carolina bman tough shot hell draw the foul and be heading to the line where he makes 74 Armando Bott with a couple of quick fouls remaining there on the bench hasnt made a major difference Kad with the foul there and bman will shoot it a college game day Sunday 1100 am on ES BN from blackburg Carolina taking on number eight Virginia Applause Tech and hell drop that one in and thats a positive sign for Virginia Obie the last time they played on this floor they were one of 11 from the free throw line so Reese beakman getting to the line making the first two of the day for Virginia things are looking up now they got to find a way to get of points on the board offensively kick ball here yeah they W for 11 and they won the game which is still staggering like you shoot one for 11 from the line youve done a lot of other things well if youre winning that game and OB the score of the game when they beat a Wake Forest team that just beat North Carolina on their home floor was 49 47 so not only did you win the game you beat a very good team which now should be cemented as a NCAA tournament team they try to give it up on the bounce and out it goes so they turn it over Virginia locking up defensively and itll be three turnovers now for North Carolina you go back and you see Elliot Kad Elijah gerud both first year players from the New Jersey area on the floor right now these guys have seen each other a lot over their careers in high school and now having an opport to play against each other in the ACC pman on the move again boy did everything he wanted to do just couldnt finish it and a collision as Ingram went down and a foul Applause here and thatll go against dun be number two yeah the second foul on Ryan Dunn now Tony Bennett going to have to go without one of the AC SE top Defenders trying to contend with Harrison Ingram on the intent on the inside Jacob Gro going to come back into the game as Jordan Miner also steps back in Virginia been able to buy minutes with Armando Bott in his second foul on the bench and Tony Bennett will take a timeout so hell take the break two Virginia trying to break into double figures with 505 to go on the half and steals the top two candidates in my opinion for ACC Defensive Player of the Year this year and thats where Virginia hangs its hat but theyre going to have to find a way to put some points on the board here Ryan with a clean look switches that in from threepoint L cormack Ryan who has had success on this floor during his time with noted a and now youre talking about a 60e who is showing up and showing his experience 12 points for ma lion out of the 21 for North Applause Carolina Rose takes a pop there the foul on the youngster Kad hit him for his second foul Hubert Davis will bring in Paxton woic a 65 grad who can hit a 32 Kack Ryan by the way with 12 points Virginia is a team with e Obie this is where Virginia is going to have to find some way to get Jacob Grove some looks beyond the threepoint line of course North Carolina knows that and theyre not going to give him anything easy but Jacob roves is the guy in my opinion who has to be that guy that ignites as offense for Virginia we were here to watch him make five threepointers in the first half and then go to Clemson and knock down three threepointers in the first half in Two big games for Virginia rolling inside Washington lost control of it Carolinas kicked it over four times course the Cavaliers rarely do that just about eight turnovers per Applause game stopped at the foul line and bad spacing right there Groves running right into mcneel ger down the lane no would have had a number of layups and pretty good looks that have not gone down Ingram heres Davis and hell draw the foul with 335 to go theyre howling here because they thought there was a foul on the other end but Virginia with one field goal in about 14 minutes of point in this game is now over for four leading the ACC at 21 points a game so we come up on 320 to go here in the first half OB North Carolina is a quarter of a way to their average they average over 82 points per game that shows you how good defensively Virginia is with arando Bott only two points foul trouble and RJ Davis who AES 213 scoreless the problem is for M Bryant has been a Difference Maker as Jordan Miner is able to come up with the second chance points Virginia a gritty bucket they desperately needed b seven minutes two fouls Ryan Dunn nine minutes and a couple of fouls too and poked out of bounds by Virginia and beatman and Tony Bennett will get the big fell Cannon back in So Virginia finally gets to double figures off the top of your head what did you say in the Tony Bennett era the lowest points in a half were for Virginia I dont even have to go top of the head OB I know these but by memory it was in the first half it was 15 points versus Iowa State and in the second half it was 15 vers Duke so that is the lowest in the Tony benett era of points and a half and right now Virginia with 10 points flirting with breaking that record here today they just went another seven minutes without a field goal 234 to go before the Applause break and Miner will head to the Applause line and this is a scuffle for him 57 for the grb out of Kingston Massachusetts transfer from marabac and looked really good on that first one so as bad as things have gone for Virginia its only 211 theres still very much in it if they can find some people as C said who can make shots and Tony waiting on that but its important to do it here at the end of this first half in the last 2 and 12 minutes in order to have that momentum going into the halftime locker room I do believe Virginia will have something different offensively in the second half but they need to make a run here be in transition mcne off the front of the iron big rebound by ger theres going to be a foul there against North Carolina on the HIIT that was Davis I believe and how about Elijah gerw the best athlete on this Virginia team skying high for the offensive rebound and now an opportunity to put points on the board for Virginia and once again Obie if ger is able to make both these free throws now were talking about a sevenpoint game still 212 remaining so as poorly as things have gone offensively for Virginia is simply about staying in contact because its a Virginia team that struggles when they get down big trying to get back into games as mentioned this place has been an absolute House of Horrors for North Carolina going back to 2012 thats a last time they won here February 25 of 12 so when day shy of exactly 12 years and the this was going toam lucky going to go over and make sure that that was RJ Davis cuz thats his second foul and so Armando Bott already on the bench with the two fouls Jamie lucky wants to be certain that it was RJ Davis that they got the right person that they call for that foul this already has the feeling of a bizarre finish doesnt it I its just setting us up Obie you and I are both movie critics its a movie that starts off slow its going to have a major climax at the end youre talking about a blockbuster its a Sonic Blockbuster OB its going to be a thriller its a Sonic Blockbuster 212 left to the half this is what theyre taking a look Applause at is going to pick up the personal for North Applause Carolina and gertude will head to the Applause line Virginia did have their 23 game home winning streak come to an end when they fell to pit here on February 13 He will knock down number one and they Contin to creep back in this thing from the foul line which is a a not a reliable source for The Who thus far this year only shooting 64 for the free throw line on this season the worst in the ACC however now four straight free throws made to make this a sevenpoint game as the crowd here at jpj starts to get even more lively Ryan catches fires got it oh hes been the answer OB as he shushes the crowd corack Ryan now with his fifth threepoint field goal in this first half and immediately put that index finger up to the lips to quiet the crowd big big half for him game in averaging 11 points a Applause game mcne wants to get closer on the bounce Miner very strong under there Washington with the block did a good job staying home defensively well yeah give North Carolina a lot of credit Withers and Washington both just Walling up on the interior not allowing Jordan Miner to be able to get a good shot off and thatll go the other way thatll be against North Carolina and that that is going to be on RJ Davis so thats going to be his second foul Yuber Davis going to most likely get a sub for RJ here with 126 remaining and Hu is not happy at all on the sideline right now well hes lost his top score for the last 126 of the half and he has had bot for the last 1239 of this first half however cor M Bryan has had himself a shooting Clinic here beakman kicks Groves out top heres ger again and its 36 points a game on the bench right now here for North Carolina poked by Ingram with the thefts and will lay that up and in and a whistle as well made a beautiful move to the basket he held the ball out High to his right and got hit and made it anyway but Harrison Ingram does it all getting out into the passing Lane creates the contact with Elijah gerud and finishes it off opportunity for the and one as Harrison Ingram steps up and makes a huge play to now get the lead back to 12 in and out 2614 under a minute to go her to attack and whistle Washington going up high went for another block 532 to go in the half how about the Freshman Elijah gerw getting it done and a guy that hasnt played many minutes as of late but Tony Bennett trying to get some type of energy injected into this building goes to the first year in gerw and he has responded the tough offensive rebound making free throws and now an opportunity to get back to the free throw line to get it back to 10 well he has been a jolt of energy here miss is on the first foul shot but he has given Tony Bennett a nice little jol to life he absolutely has done that and youre talking about the best athlete on this Virginia roster and again hes going to be very good in this Virginia uniform its going to take time for him a young man who TS ACL to begin his senior season of high school so hes just getting back into playing form and miss the pair there Applause though trible up top Withers with the swing downstairs theres Washington double up shot clock to seven knocked Away by beakman and bman will slam it Virginia really baiting North Carolina into that turnover thats what Reese beakman does best and one of the reasons why he leads the ACC and Steals and is one of the best defensive players for karmac Ryan coming on the road being that third score for North Carolina with Armando Bott in foul trouble RJ Davis now sitting with those two fouls and Obie had opportunity to eat breakfast this morning with both Mike and rosemary Ryan they made the trip now from New York to see their son and he has rewarded them for coming to watch him play well he sure has a season High 5 threes for him 15 points his career high is six hes almost gotten that in a half Carolina holding for the final shot before the break K gives it up why not Ryan again at this time the follow by Davis at the horn wont drop he had a tough first 20 minutes Virginia certainly did but 36 different here at jpj but theyre going to have to find a way to get quality looks on this offensive end Ro gives it up MC hoists it cant hit it and they remain with a big goose egg in the threepoint column they R for seven but a tough shot with only 3 seconds remaining on the shot clock for Isaac mcne and we talked about North Carolina defensively they have shown up in a major way on the defensive end of the floor this afternoon B and Davis back in there open up the second half where Hubert Davis Hubert by the way is 50 and five when North Carolina has the lead at halftime but of course this place has been a completely different story for North Carolina charlotts F the E straight losses trying to snap that here Ryan again not this time Virginia shooting a little under 177 the first half and a rare turnover for the Cavaliers and thats three today and just miscommunication Ryan dun slashing to the basket Reese ree beakman expecting him to be outside the threepoint line as the two having conversation going back down the floor but look at that number lost eight straight road games at UVA the last win in 2012 and as you mentioned there been some great North Carolina teams that have come in and lost in this building andry downstairs for bacock very difficult angle Miner stayed with him right there on his hip great job standing his ground Jordan Miner whos made a difference for this Virginia team anchoring the interior often times they dont have to double team when hes in the game beakman trying to spin on RJ Davis got in close and knocked it down and thats by Design Bree beakman taking advantage of his size once again and also remember RJ Davis playing with those two fouls cant afford to pick pick up another one so by Design Tony Bennett sending ree beakman into the post Beakmans got three or four inches on RJ kadot to drive it and it rolls off the 10 Miner collecting it on the Baseline hes had some really nice moments in this game absolutely had a great moment there keeping Armando Bott one of the best offensive rebounders in ACC history off the glass keeping them from getting a second chance points Miner spinning left and lays it in one of the best moves of the day by Cavalier and a 40 run to start this half for Virginia this environment feels different North Carolina has missed six consecutive shots going back to the first half they got to get this man going Davis will draw the foul and RJ Davis headed to the Applause line the one area where people have been able to exploit North Carolina as they start a smaller backcourt with RJ Davis and Elliot CAD ree peakman who has about a four inch Advantage height wise over RJ Davis just gets to a spot and uses athleticism to raise over top for the bucket minor second foul Davis a 90 foul shooter hes also on Pace to set the Carolina record for most threes in the season held by Justin Jackson in 201617 today its all about gaining ground on Duke the Duke Blue Devils fell in Wake Forest earlier today in a Dandy of a Game Hunter Salis with 29 for the Demon Deacons and you see the switch now defensively RJ Davis guarding Isaac mcne Kack Ryan taking on the challenge of guarding Rees beakman they dont want to put RJ in that position but now they get the switch Reese has to go right back into the post bman Nifty bounce feed and laid in by miner thats the pass of the day that has to be the recipe for Tony Bennett give the basketball to Rees beakman and allow him to go make a play this is a game where hes going to have to do a lot for Virginia Bott doubled again thats every time he touches it Ryan straight on yes another triple but the mistake is the short close out by Andrew roie you understand back Ryan has already made five threepoint field goals you dont close out short you run him off the threepoint line hes not had a great year for threepoint distance 32 but hes having a great day and hes had a handful of really nice ones at 18 against Villanova 20 against Kentucky thatll roll off the iron and now here come thear Hills trying to build on a 3122 advantage on the road where they played well theyre six and two in the conference wins it pit Clemson andc State Boston College FSU and Miami Ryan again and time in and out tapped out and out completely by bacock so the scoring picking up here thank goodness for that here in the today when you consider what has happened with RJ Davis having to go up against the best one ball defender in the AC and one of maybe the top two or three in the country and Reese beakman but RJ Davis is not just a score he does things to help his team win and hes going to have to continue to do that to get a win here on the road missed all six Ro on target for a threepointer and Rod will stick it they finally hit the first threepointer they had been over for seven and only made six threepoint field goals in the last two games combined for Virginia so a welcome sight to see roie knock one down Davis on the drive hopping into the lane and hell go to the line these are shots that typically RJ would finish a high number of and be going to the line for a threepoint play it just hasnt developed that way today but you also consider we talk about Reese beakman and his steals Reese beakman also averages over a block per game so from the guard position RJ playing probably against probably the better shot blockers that youre going to see as a on ball Defender 32 25 NBA coming your way on prime time Saturday Jaylen Brunson and the Knicks in Boston taking on Jason Tatum and the Celtics who lead the East coverage tipping off with NBA Countdown at 800 Eastern 500 Pacific OB if I told you that when jayen Brunson was in the seventh grade he was actually here working out on this court his dad Rick was an assistant coach for Dave loo back in the day so jayen Brunson Charlottesville ties run very strong so much so that Tony Bennett actually thought they would had a chance to get him when he was coming out of Hostage L another rebound on the sck back hes been a presence he has 10 points he came in averaging Four Points a game and that was one of the areas where Hubert Davis talked to us about they havent been great securing defensive rebounds for a team that leads the ACC and rebounding Jordan Miner exploiting that on the Tar Heels as of late the Virginia barely got to 16 points at halftime but now theyve close the gap to six is Davis and and out just not his day he still hasnt hit a shot OB its a sixpoint game right now big possession for Virginia done on the Bas thats a block by bot wait did he time that perfectly yeah underrated part of his game we talk about the rebounding and the scoring hes been a guy thats defended the rim very well he threw that off Miner on the Baseline so its going to be North Carolina ball 33 27 but Jordan Miner getting the job done on the offensive glass coming up with the offensive rebound and finishing it and right now the crowd looking at all these beautiful big screens as Amando Bott attempted to throw the basketball off of Jordan Miner but I believe what the crowd saw was the ball hitting Bott on the way out see if we can get a better look at that heres treble to Davis under 14 to play who would have thought this game would be this close the way Virginia shot the ball 5 for 30 at one point Davis finally on the board with a threepointer another streak on the line OB is the fact that RJ Davis has made multiple threepointers in 20 consecutive games Jamie lucky with a another timeout here an official stoppage of play and Tony Bennett who received a technical foul two games ago yeah bench warning here oh but they got the bench warning but however Bott never threw that basketball off of Miner it just went off his hands out of bounds and think about that play RJ Davis knocks down a three on that possession so now a ninepoint game in comparison to six with Virginia with the basketball yeah Tony got his first technical since 2010 this year the lean in by beakman and cleaned up by Bott was pass Bill Russell on the alltime college rebounding list Bott going in strong not there and a foul will go against Virginia on the interior and the crowd howling again here now they believe strong a call has gone against them dun will pick up his third foul for Virginia this is a big Miss as maybe the defensive player of the in the conference goes to the bench we shall see 13 minutes to go and dropped in by Withers and he heads to the bench and Ryan dun and jayen Withers both going for the basketball thats a 5050 ball I understand EX exactly why the crowd is upset about that one 5050 ball thats no ones possession Im not sure why Ron Dunn got called for that one not much there 13 minutes to play Wake Forest beating Duke earlier this afternoon Ro putting a head down and kicks to grov who barely made the catch in the corner Andrew roie again shot CL down the six heres beatman to drive into the blue shirts long one roie no that missed ugly and it never got to the rim so its shot like violation OB we take a look at the standings in the ACC this is coming into our game now given a result of wakes win over Duke North Carolina the top dog at the moment by half a game and theres Virginia third place 11 and five OB at this point in the game for Virginia youve got to understand the climate things have not gone your way but however the crowd is after these officials you have to find a way to attack the basket Force the officials to make the call for you in comparison to shooting jump shots and bailing the officials out to where they dont have to make that North Carolina continues to attack the basket they lead the ACC with 18 made free throws a game Fall Away not there Withers snatching the rebound Crowds Are Always terrific here at John Paul Jones Arena theyve been a big reason why Virginia has been so darn good not just against North Carolina against everybody for a long time 14 and one here this year B is stepping on the line and he will turn that over so we will take the break 1151 left here in Charlottesville North Carolina on top yeah Im not a big subscriber to Joey bracket I subscribe to Jimmy brackus which would be Jim beheim and congratulations to my guy having Jim Bean day at Syracuse earlier and coach bahim and I both believe that Pittsburgh also is in that mix and they will be the sixth team from the ACC that will be in the NCAA tournament with the outside chance of the orange who got a big win today at home nice home win bigman fouled before the shots re beakman the 63 senior from Milwaukee and Obie we had a chance and we talked with Hubert Davis about it earlier today the value or devaluation of the ACC by the national pundits its really just gone too far however one thing is for certain we all within this league recognize how good of a league it is and the coaches absolutely play a part in that just flat better than the national narrative as Harris steps back and knocks one down Dante Harris maybe he could be an answer today for Virginia a guy who transferred from Georgetown missed about 10 games this year with an ankle injury he can play offense and he can be a playmaker also so it doesnt all fall on his shoulders of Reese beakman to go out and make play for Virginia for M Ryan hes been the story today for North Carolina H his highest number threes this season Davis on the Move RJ Davis working hard tough angle there and Bott with the rebound in a second effort and he has seven for the day and thats where amondo Bott is at his best getting Second Chance opportunities for his team he and Jordan Miner have battled in that area here this afternoon bot slams it in they get it to the big fella and Armondo does the rest the 611 grad to make it 4229 just a little late on the rotation by Elijah geru getting over there that could have easily been a steal had it been anticipated Applause earlier thr wants to launch boy got a really good look and it kicked out and a whistle in the lane there with 108 left and back to the Slam by Bott Armando Bott who came up with the offensive rebound earlier puts back two second chance points on this one off a nice five from RJ Davis now bot just picked up his third so three fouls on Armando just came up with his fifth consecutive double double last weekend when he went for 25 12 against Virginia Tech yondo has 26 20 and 10 games throughout his career as he comes up with another rebound none bigger than the 2922 rebound effort he had against Virginia a couple of seasons ago but he has not been able to get going on this building here where he considered he would be coming to school Davis just been stone cold today one for 10 shooting it pakman drive through and theyre going to wave it off no basket there its not going to be the popular call here here but its actually the right call when you see the play Elliot kdo tries to wrap ree beakman up earlier in the play theres the foul as you go ah I dont know OB thats a little closer than I thought it was I may say thats an an one on that one from this angle earlier that looked as though it was but looking at it from under the basket that possibly should have been an ant one third on can Ryan with the Applause block second try here beakman no Ingram with the rebound man as he its a monster rebounding games at 19 against NC State 17 against defu and averaging nine rebounds a Applause game RJ Davis and itll be kned Away by Virginia so North Carolina will retain possession under 9 minutes to play it has been physical down low when you start talking about Jordan Miner Armond Bott two strong guys going at it and they have been mixing it up all day long Bott who missed a majority of the first half with those two fouls has made his presence felt here in the second half shot clock to three Hubert Davis pointed at that and batted away from AR J up ahead Harris Harris feeding ger and a block and a foul on the play corm Ryan and that is a great foul by cormack Ryan because Elijah geru can flat out fly he was about to take off and finished that one strong hes about to rise up for a flying Gertrude Texas and Kansas coming your way and thatll be followed by Texas AM and Tennessee you cant say flying gertude and then go read a promo while Im laughing I tried you got to give me a time to get my laughter out on that one before you go to promo at the line for two and sinks number one and hes had a presence in this game no question ger is really giving Virginia good minutes off the bench and the energy that hes been able to establish getting on the floor it takes a lot for Tony Bennett to trust you as a first year but hes starting to gain some and this will go a long way with him and Elijah Music gerre so Virginia stuck at 30 points they managed to score only 41 on Monday at Virginia Tech a really ran him off the floor and Music blackburg Ryan lost the handle out it rolls and back over to Virginia and the great job defensively by gerw forcing the turnover on that possession first and foremost running corac Ryan off the threepoint line and forcing him to put the basketball on the floor which is not his strong suit and getting possession back for Applause Virginia Ryan on mcne Le hes had a rough shooting game and this time itll rattle Hall and a nice spin the first field goal for iMac going to the turn around jumper and give North Carolina a lot of credit for the job theyve done defensively on mcne and a whistle here against Virginia mcne had been 046 Groves with the foul and another moment here North Carolina try to win on this floor for the first time in 12 years and they lead Virginia 4232 with the ball OB ACC tournament and Washington DC the last time it was in DC in 2016 it was these two teams on the floor at the end of it and North Carolina was able to win that ACC tournament went on to the final four That season but a strong contingent of Virginia fans both in the mix on that one is Tony Bennett not happy with this call yeah thats going to go against McNeely as he tied up with the Freshman Kad Tonys been hot today M number two Kad got away with one on that one OB it looks as though kadoo grab McNeils arm pulling them both down and fooling the officials into calling that an offensive foul on McNeil Bon for Davis Davis a runner just nothing dropping for him but a second chance opportunity Harrison Ingram coming up with the offensive rebound now the fifth offensive rebound for North Carolina who come into the game leading the ACC averaging over 12 a game yeah they a two great offensive rebounders bot and Ingram Davis one for 11 shooting launches again right in front of the shot clock Bon another offensive board and this has been the struggle for Virginia throughout this season one of the things has been an Achilles heel for the whoos giving up Second Chance points Kad B tried to follow and hell draw the foul with 635 to go going back to what Tony Bennett was upset about but watch watch Elliot kdo grab the arm of Isaac McNeely tough to see from that angle and Tony is trying to show Jamie lucky exactly what I look ATT to see it where kadoo originally pulled mcne into him and fooled the officials into calling that an offensive foul taking away a possession for Virginia on the offensive end of the floor where its been difficult enough to score so they cant afford turnovers they both coaches over the course of a game have gripes he has a couple yeah he does have a couple in this game however one of the things that as you see watch Elliot kdo grabbing the one has his hand wrapped around McNeely and then grabs his shoulder pulls it to him kadoo got away with one on that one cuz that would have been the fourth foul on Elliot cadu bman trying to bring the who back here hands off for dun and a collision thatll be a blocking foul against Carolina with 616 to go but Virginia for an important stretch of the game here unable to chip away at this lead not an overwhelming Le lead but cant seem to draw any closer well and thats one of the areas where Virginia can use some production from Ryan Dunn who gets the easy bucket inside the zone as his big brother Justin the major league baseball pitcher of course OB all the in your area is in attendance with his father Ed Mom Donna here this evening made the trip down to watch Ryan play Cross Court Canó with a catch big open would look but no and now done coming up with a big rebound Virginia could absolutely use his energy here in this last stretch gerud whos been the Energizer Bunny at times today itll be knocked out of play in Virginia will retain and cor M Ryan coming back on now replacing Trimble for North Carolina ran to his 18 Applause points and six out of 11 from three made one only one three here in this second half Virginias done a better job defensively staying connected pman oh got everything you wanted except the basket the follow up by miner but theres that guy again Jordan Miner has been spectacular for Virginia on the offensive glass and Miner now in double figures with 12 points to go along with his nine rebounds well his big crowd stepping right back in it again trying to make a difference who will respond for North Carolina Ingram back for the Freshman shot clock winding down a misfire beakman playing with a lot of quickness and energy knocked away and stolen away by Davis on the turnover and bman will foul him way before the shot and just a rare turnover by re beakman one of the most shorthanded players in the ACC just mishandling the basketball coming down and really trying to direct traffic trying to talk to Isaac MCN about what they wanted and just raise the basketball up high enough for RJ Davis to take it away from him and its been that type of stretch for Tony Bennett and his team as of late on the offensive end Davis with eight points now and one of his quietest days of the Season by far on the road here in Charlottesville but at the line hes as close to automatic as you get yeah 90 right now he will be the alltime leading free throw percentage leader in University of North Carolina history and youre talking about some great players coming through and of course as we talk about that kiss of death yep as your announcer Jinx for you 446 to go and 4536 North Carolina but he has been a spectacular foul shooter right ahead of my brother Shaman Williams and RJ shooting at 90 this season most likely will finish the year at number one but has the opportunity to come back and play another year as his class is the last class that will have the co year trs going to be foued ingr went up the block as Virginia got it inside that paint with four and a half showing Elijah gerud has been great with his cutting his movement away from the basketball putting himself in position to get fouled and get to the free throw line throughout this game ingrams first Gs been spending a lot of time at the line and he makes Music 70 and tomorrow Elizabeth kley and number eight Virginia Tech will be hosting North Carolina at 200 Eastern on acc Network the college game D crew will Tip It Off from blackburg at 1100 am on ESPN the castle guard is going to be rocking as my brother cousin Kenny Brooks and the hokes take on Deja Kelly and the tar Hills in there one of the loudest Arenas in college basketball not just ACC Liz kitley a great great player what a spectacular career Two time ACC Player of the Year and could possibly win it a third but her biggest comp comptition is Georgia Amore the point guard for the h another Miss there by Davis Applause 4537 pman negotiating again over the top ler no he hasnt missed many of those today yeah thats a bucket that you need to be able to finish especially trying to come back and yet Virginia hanging around as they so often do but now four on five Bott slams thats what happens when you gamble for the steel and you dont get it you put your defense in a tough spot Miner who went after the steel and didnt get it when he falls down now youre playing 514 Applause offensively and a whistle with 317 to go and a timeout Timeout on the floor and a 10point game Jordan Miner thought he had the steal but when you go for it and you dont get it as he goes down now its a 514 Advantage for North Carolina the easy finish from Armando Bott nothing away from Armando Bott for getting into this great company however I have to mention that Tim Duncan and Ral sson both did it in four years thats true this is year five for Amando Bott so hes had many more opportunities to do it I believe this is now his 159th game in a North Carolina Tar Hill uniform which is still a tremendous accomplishment because over 50 of his games throughout his career hes had a double double but theyre still in asterisk beside it Virginia try to creep a little bit closer and with threepointers like that from mcne they can so its a sevenpoint game great execution out of the timeout by Tony Bennetts group to make it a sevenpoint game and getting Isaac McNeely going theyre going to need his shooting prowess down the stretch here to get a win they made on only two out of 13 beyond that line Davis one for 14 today Ingram keeps it alive and a second chance here for Carolina its been a big difference in the game the offensive rebounding for the tar Hills has all season and you talked about how they have two legitimate threats as far as offensive rebounders and Bott and Harrison Ingram on the inside both of them come up with big plays but now Virginia does the job defensively and gets their 24 shot clock violation of the season 24 after we go final K thank you very much this one a grinder a rock fight however you want to describe it low scoring game 47 to 40 but Virginia has the ball trying to hang on to it here a Reach In by Ingram and commits the foul at 213 to go look at T swizzy Taylor is everywhere OB we saw all over the NFL playoffs the Super Bowl and now shes made her way anybody no I mean you well not here definitely not here MN at the line Music 88 sophomore from West Virginia makes number one and Virginia still very much in the game despite shooting 28 for the contest but the reason they are is because theyve held a team that averages 83 points per game to 47 and right now with in Striking Distance at five can the defense come up with another huge stop for Virginia to try to get him an opportunity to make it a one possession game Carolina fans asking where is RJ Davis Bott has shown a block done with a rejection the accs top man McAn transition hell launch it and well short and a whistle in the paints but Jordan miner going after another offensive rebound gets the foul so he has an opportunity to get to the free throw line on the one and one and how about the accs leading shot blocker Ryan Dunn taking on Armond Bott at the rim and now done the gim me Miner with an opportunity to make this a onep possession game if he can take care care of business here at the line and he misses the front end its a struggle for him at the line under 60 sense was a struggle for Virginia at the line and you and I on Monday looked at the free throw shooting numbers and you told me plain as day this is going to hurt Virginia in a close game at some point defensively by reys beakman hes just sealed up his second straight ACC Defensive Player of the Year War hes been great with big stops and all over Davis open man is Ingram on the feet and he will lay it off off the window but so much attention being paid to the shooters coming off of screens you forgot about Harrison Ingram under the basket for the easy bucket Big Mo Davis right with him coming up on one minute to go and another whistle and a timeout timeout Virginia 1 minute 14 seconds to play in Charlottesville and North Carolina the number 10 team in the country going to hang on and pick up win number 21 more importantly overall their 13th win in the conference and that will give them two games of separation from the Duke Blue Devils who lost away Forest lets check with the studio and Dave we want to let you know weve got big 12 action in the on Deck Circle Dylan D Su in Texas an eight sieges startout the day according to Joey brackets resume opportunity in the fog that game game coming your way after we finish up in Charlottesville Music 4942 and a minute 14 seconds to go mentioned this earlier North Carolina playing for the first time in a week their longest break between games since Christmas time a Davis telling us it was great to have all of that practice time not worrying about a game midweek Carolina beginning the day tied with Duke for first place with five to play nine to get off his shot ger sinks it big bucket you can see the confidence that Tony Bennett has grown in Elijah gerw in this game alone having him on the floor here at frunch time stop the clock here with a foul and 536 to go but a good foul to pend Harrison Ingram to the free throw line in comparison to sending RJ Davis there whos normally the guy he and cor M Ryan who shoots 87 with Davis over 90 those are normally the guys shooting the basketball from the free throw line down the stretch Harrison Ingram just 57 as opposed to 90 for RJ Davis at the foul line but he will hit number one one free throw that makes a twopossession game still with you two threepointers this is an important free throw to try to stretch it out to three possession for England and thatll roll off Bott wins the battle and they get it back and a reach around foul by beakman so 458 to go and itll be Davis again to shoot Armond Bott has not had a strong offensive game however he has done what he does best North Carolinas alltime leading rebounder which he accomplished in Four Seasons comes up with a huge offensive rebound off of a Mis free throw that sends the accs well one of the accs best free throw shooters Joe Gerard actually number one RJ Davis to another one coming for RJ Davis bot by the way now with 90 games with 10 or more rebounds and his decorated career for North Applause Carolina his second free throw coming that time he makes the pair and North Carolina will take the timeout leading 52 to Applause 44 so another break here in Charlottesville Ron Sanchez associate head coach of University of Virginia Sanchez went to watch him in the eighth grade and text me and said this kid is going to be really good Virginia offered him as a ninth grader but he chose Chapel Hill and its been a great decision for amont mman look for a blow by it wont drop for him and a big Miss and another foul to stop the clock 349 North Carolina trying to Salt this game away at the free throw line today so one more look at Bracketology Joey brackets earlier today putting Wake Forest in after that huge win against the Duke Blue Devils last four inine with Virginia Clemson Duke in North Carolina in the ACC who might join them thatll be fascinating this is not a bad loss for Virginia again I mean North Carolina right now is 62 on the road in the ACC strong possibility they win this when they go to 72 on the road but this is one of the best teams in the country and they proved that today because because they can win ugly this was not a highscoring game for them and Virginia wanted to make this game ugly thats the way that they compete with North Carolina the reason why they have a eight game winning streak on this floor against the tar Hills but Virginia offensively just could not get it going and you know to your point as ger flies in and cant connect North Carolina has shot a season low 32 and theyre going to walk out of here with a victory Virginia has done their job in the eight game winning streak on this floor Virginia has surrendered 54 points a game to North Carolina you look at it its 54 points they did their job defensively they just could not get enough offense out of this group and they finally snap that losing skid here at Virginia North Carolina wins it 54 to 44 over the Cavaliers their first win
