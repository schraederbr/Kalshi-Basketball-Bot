want to get up and down and run Syracuse and Cornell theyve been playing for over 100 years todays no different Freeman on for the tip against Raglin and well start with the orange on offense lets lets have some fun in Syracuse New York your starting lineup just a little bit different today jier Davis in place of Eddie lampin whos a little banged up after backtoback games in Brooklyn heres Starling taking to the rack out of bounds Cornell Applause ball for the big red experienced group different from most teams Syracuse will play this year guy Raglin Jr is the tallest player at just 68 Syracuse needs to be able to have a fast start a quick start take care of the ball as you see right there R everybody on the Cornell team can shoot the basketball they play at the highest Pace in the NCAA biggest thing with Cornell can they make good decisions playing at that fast BCE yeah guy Ragland is the supposed big man hes the one you just saw knocked down that three he shot over 40 last season 35 this year from behind the arc the orange looking for those first points heres jquan Carlos into the corner Starling had 27 against Texas Tech last time out and that one short thats Cooper Nord on the boards and thats a shot JJ can get any time probably wants to take that one back the orange need to start off aggressively attacking the paint Cornell really has no rim protector theres AK o car misses his first shot Davis on the Applause Music Applause board down low to Freeman the freshman and his first shots long the orange start 0 for two Jack we talked about Donnie Freeman being able to be an inside out guy but start inside and then work your way out and you see Cooper Nord continuing to do what Cornell does best and that shoot the basketball and play at a high Pace he is a premier shooter 39 last season a marksman from deep and thats what this Cornell team wants to do they want to shoot a lot of threes and thats how its been these past few seasons Cornell has had a winning record for three straight years last year they had their first 20 win season in over a decade and went to the NIT for the first time in school history lazir Williams the senior guard crosscourt to o car he spins and takes his second shot that one Falls and its eight nothing Cornell Adrien arrey has seen enough I mean Cornell is just playing how they want to play you know theyre getting up and down theyre attacking theyre being aggressive kind of like what Youngstown State did the last home game Syracuse played theyre just being aggressive aggressive in playing their game its and this is what Cornell wants to do they want to shoot threes with guys like Raglin the big man and and Cooper Nord everybodys dangerous from Deep Well great job by Raglin you see him he was going to set the screen then he just popped back and knocked it down and thats just you know Cooper Nord doing what he does knocking down the threepoint shot a threepoint shooting a huge part of this Cornell team 32 this season so far but dvo what are your other dimes for Cornell the rest of the way yeah so for Cornell I I think defending the basketball obviously we know they can score the basketball they have to be able to keep Syracuse outside of the paint and then also get good shots you saw right there they got two good shots right there they have to be able to screen well and then they play in that fast pace are they able to get their guys ahead of the defense and get some easy looks so Cornell starts three of four from the field knocking down a pair of Threes an early eight nothing lead Dome crowd still on its feet waiting for that first bucket Carlos aggressive down low cant get it to fall Davis fights for the board but Raglin rips it away and that should be an area of success for Syracuse today the glass but not so far 10 nothing after The Nair Williams land again Corell is being the aggressive Syracuse offensively looks tentative they look hesitant theyre not being aggressive at all this has been an area of concern for Syracuse all close games this season the orange are three and two they havent won a game by double digits the three wins being Le Mo Colgate and Youngstown State in double overtime heres Freeman the jumper that one Falls and the orange are on the Applause Music board tried to get the pass down low it rolls out of bounds Syracuse ball dvo what do you got for the Q in your dimes today two things that they have to be able to do Transition defense we talked about the pace that Cornell plays with getting up and down Syracuse has to be able to stop the ball they have to be able to get back in transition and then secondly attack the paint Cornell has no rim protector they have no shot blockers they have to put the pressure on the defense get two feet in the paint create from there and see what opportunities that they have Starling attacks the paint with the floater Davis cant get the the board Cornell again Cornell is going to push make Miss theyre going to get up and down a double team up High raglins free over to Jake Fegan that ones long rebound by DJ Nicks into the ball game Williams can hit the three jier Davis is there his first start for cutes Freeman kicks to the corner Starling short Williams on the the board and if Im Syracuse I dont want to continue to play in the half court I know JJ missed a shot but been able to get out and run and get some early opportunities in transition would favor the Syracuse basketball team Raglin at 68 good shooter but here down low took an extra Applause Music Applause step 102 Cornell with an early lead headed to our first break Jake should get the head job this year that he wrote a letter of recommendation via email to the athletic department all roads lead back to Central New York Jakes just 36 years old in his first season moving over from that associate head coach spot after Brian Earl took the head coaching job at William and Mary but as of right now dvo this a program headed in the right Direction A Few Good Seasons in a row and theyve built up to a point where they can compete against Syracuse well we talked to him before the game and we talked about how Cornell is different from every other school because they dont have any transfers you know theyre theyre bringing these guys in and theyre staying and hes done a great job of creating a culture being there 11 Seasons as a head coach and knowing the guys on a personal level hes done a great job of just you know creating that chemistry creating that culture and getting guys really to compete at a high level it was also cool to hear him say that he was excited to come and play in the dome here and Coach here he said his guys are excited to play here some some coaches will play it off cool like yeah we dont care its just any other game he was honest and said no were really excited for it this is one of the best venues to play in a college basketball if youre not excited to play here at the Dome I dont know what to tell you I mean he he knows what type of atmosphere this is hes played in it hes coached in it and hes didnt to have his guys ready and obviously they are tonight the 102 lead about five and a half minutes in here on Thanksgiving Eve thats Ryan kashin goes to the bucket for two hes the tallest player in the rotation at just 610 and expect him to play 10 to 15 minutes a game well thats something that Donnie Freeman just has to be more physical you just let a guy take you off the dribble going into your chest and just shoot a a hook shot right over you its you have to be more physical on the defensive side of the basketball back the other way off the glass and in for Jacob beckles the Speedy sophomore Guard from Philly a 12point lead already Syracuse shooting just one of 11 from the field transition defense was was the key for Syracuse and theyre doing a terrible job of stopping the ball and getting back just nobody touching the the offensive player straight to the basket with no no anything and just easy layups starlings floater off the mark kosin on the rebound a steal from Bell to the hoop cant get it to fall Freemans got the Music board short floater cant fall either and there is just a lid on the rim right now just Syracuse just looks disorganized offensively theyre shooting shots that you know every shot right now is tough and defensively they seem like theyre not communicating theyre not locking in the thing that they can do right now is try to get out in transition and get an easy look heres Bell short jumper its short a horrible start from the field for Syracuse one for 15 thats AKO car and it stays a 12point game Bell through contact finally gets an easy lay in and it ends the 4minute scoring drought dck when youre one of 15 somebody has to say give me the ball just put your head down and get to the rim and try to make something happen good job by Chris Bell taking it all the way to the basket DJ Knicks for three thats strong Davis on the board JJ Starling a rough start to this one 0 for four after going nine of 15 against Texas Tech down in Brooklyn jquan Carlos knocks down the midrange jumper thats a positive seeing Carlos knock one down early hes been struggling in this early season Syracuse needs to be able to get something from him on the offensive side of the ball and hearing from coach ay after the Texas Tech game you know he said guys like jquan Carlos they dont need him to score a lot but to just get a couple of buckets from him would be huge and theres another bucket for Cornell on the n Music one Jake ju car caros good pull up midrange knocking it down Cornell is just back inside the Dome Cornell leads Syracuse 166 and the shooting Wes have continued in this early season Syracuse needs to attack the paint play off of two feet create opportunities at The Rim try to get to the free throw line if they dont have opportunity as the RM suck the defense in and look for that drive and kick well our sideline reporter sha dorelis says more on Syracuses shooting W yeah Jack its been five close games thus far this season for the cardiac cuse in fact theyre one of the only teams in the nation that hasnt gone on or conceded a 10 nothing run so far this season that just changed at the start of this game but thanks Sean its definitely been a rough start Syracuse is two of its last 12 three of 17 overall from the field this isnt typical of a Syracuse team not to be able to shoot especially one that we expected to have a good shooting touch this year well look Jack three of 17 okay we understand youre going to go through shooting Wes at times but what I cant understand is the effort on the defensive side of the ball youre missing shots now youre letting that lag over to the defensive side of the ball youre letting that affect your effort that cannot happen for Syracuse as Starling gets fouled on the cut as Syracuse has a few Subs in the game Elijah Mo Peter movich The Freshman Off the Bench and for the first time this year Eddie lampin coming in as a sub Corell makes a couple of swaps as well Jake fan back into the game their leading scorer averaging 16 a game heres Bell just two points for him on the board download of my storage and hes fouled by Adam Hinton the junior guard I think thats a matchup that you you go to right away you see Peter had the mismatch regardless if hes a scorer or not hes going to create some type of you know mismatch within the defense where theyre going to have to come and help and create for somebody else now this seems like a game that could be a good fit for Eddie lampin down low because of the size difference you think thats why that sub just happened right now if if Im Syracuse Im attacking the paint Im looking at Eddie to get something down low and and you know get the Cornell team in foul trouble right now Cornell is doing a great job of just being aggressive attacking off the bounce and taking what Syracuse has given him so far theyve given him some great shots 50 shooting from the field is Cornell heres AK Oar the 67 Wing whos one of the most complete players on this team he swings it pass to NAS Williams Thats deflected out of bounds and it stays with the big red forell is a team they dont have one individual guy whos really going to break you down everybody on the team can shoot the basketball they can really pass it and thats how they create shots for themselves shot clock low just two seconds and they dont know it thats a violation thats the fourth turnover for s for Cornell something that they dont typically do turn the ball over a lot and and Syracuse hasnt been able to turn teams over this season playing at that Tempo youre going to get shots up early and quick and Syracuse right there doing a good job just being solid defensively you dont see that from a team like Cornell that wants to take those shots within 15 seconds of the shot clock usually but a good defensive stop for the C heres more The Freshman guard someone therere probably hoping to be kind of a microwave Off the Bench Starling up top pulls up for the Jay off the mark another Miss for the orange the jump shooting just cant go right now well if youre not making jump shots you got to attack the basket you got to try to get to the free throw line Syracuse is just continually settling good rebound by movich something he did a nice job of against Texas Tech down in New York in 11 minutes he had six boards lamin working on Raglin draws the double Starling attacking the rim gets it to fall a great Baseline Drive by JJ playing off of two feet but earlier into possession if youre Eddie lampin you want to be able to get the ball down lower my stovich fouled right there itll stay with Syracuse and its taking them a while to figure out that thats what they want to do were still seeing a lot of jump shots from Syracuse even though you know like you said the goal should probably be to attack the paint we know its early in the season we know they still trying to figure some stuff out even with the but when you get down like this when your shots arent falling the one thing you want to do is be aggressive and attack the basket even if youre not finishing at The Rim youre aggressive youre looking for fouls you get to the free throw line now youre seeing him go in the hoop that way Bell had a nice one last time out with 22 just two points today Starling the lamin he loses it recovers finds the pass to Starling three on the shot clock the runner through contact offensive board lamin got foul you start to see Syracuse pick up the energy a little bit see JJ doing a good job of playing off of one foot he has no balance no control play off two feet so you can get a cleaner look thats the fourth foul on Cornell and my Doric to inbound almost stolen away by Jake Fegan know DA one thing about this Cornell team yes nobody imposes you with size Raglin the biggest guy at 68 but everybodys always flying around trying to get a deflection or a rebound theyre just active ja theyre active like you said they play super hard they know their roles and they know what to do on the defensive side of the ball coach Jake has done a good job of letting them know hey this is your rotation this is where you need to be Cornell is a well coached basketball team my storage finds Lance lamin who doesnt get the layup trying for their third shot of The Possession Mo knocks down the three first long range for the day for the orange best time to get a threepoint shot off a offensive rebound good job by Elijah Moore knocking it down Nord from downtown the response is short Applause just a sixpoint deficit right now Starling to the rack through contact misses both the JJ right now one for nine I like the aggression I like him getting to the rim those ones will end up falling Raglin hits the three two of them have fallen for him today just like Youngtown State just like Le Moy just like Colgate bringing those big guys away from the Rim making him play if he can shoot it if hes pump fake get back to the get back to the paint and play like that but Cornell doing a great job of making him play away from the basket and thatll be a foul on Jacob beckles now one thing it seems like sarcu has to focus on his the transition defense but the three ball is falling for Cornell today Raglin knocks it down big you saw right away when he came here hes out there hes outside in the neighborhood picking up trash and doing all hes you know what hes really put himself in the Syracuse Community and um you know great job by his him and his staff this first year its definitely been a fun year to watch the football team is thats a foul on Peter movich his first of the game Peters a guy that seems to bring a lot to the table hes already got five rebounds in just four minutes you know Peter is an energy guy hes active he doesnt care about seeing the ball too much he just wants to win basketball games hes young hes a freshman hell continue to improve but how do you get consistent minutes right now as a freshman just by playing hard and being active and thats what Peter brings theres Ryan kashin the big man for the Cornell big red his shot is short off the glass and its Syracuse ball and heres my thing Donnie Freeman just give him a little bit more resistance you cant just let him back you down back you down and turn around and go right to the hook you see right here Donnie I mean good job us using his length but you have to be able to body up a little bit more defense is about being a little bit more physical bringing that physicality to that side as well full court press from Cornell and Syracuse hasnt had a problem breaking it yet but it just makes everything a little bit tougher get into your offense slower just seeing a Defender 94 feet at you now you have to be ready right away Freeman trying to muscle his way to the rack and he draws a foul Jack how can you be stronger going to the basket good job right here by Donnie Freeman finding the opening and get into it but again be lower play off of two feet and then explode up and through just a little nudge there by that Cornell guy just had them all off balance good job being able to get to the line though the foul on Chris Kane the senior forward Freeman knocks down the first one its been a good free throw shooter on the season 9 of 11 hes been a a pretty productive player in his freshman year 10 points a game and and nine rebounds a game to lead the team a guy that you know came in with a lot of pedigree that theyre asking a lot of pretty early on yeah he has a lot on his shoulders I think he put a lot on himself he has a lot of expectations hes a good player hes a talented player hes versatile he has to get stronger and he just has to continue to learn how to play the game he has a bright future for Syracuse beckles the Speedy guard picked up his pivot foot that time and thats another travel that was a good job right there by Donnie Freeman just hedging High making beckles think about turning that corner thats what caused the Applause travel heres Lucas Taylor the Georgia state transfer that they havent gotten a lot of offense from early on Movic to Freeman working on ragley puts the shoulder into him but great defense by Guy Applause Raglin thought about a transition three right there something weve seen a couple of times Cornell is doing a good job just being patient theyre not forcing it theyre taking what comes to them n launches a three but Freemans there on the rebound Syracuse just one of its last eight from the field more from Deep he hits another Elijah Moore hes been a bright spot in this poor start for the qes and I think hes a guy that could really help Syracuse even if its you know putting JJ off the ball letting him handle it you saw him do that a few possessions earlier but hes a guy who could really really shoot the basketball and Syracuse needs it right now A star in high school threepoint shooting contest winner Elijah Moore kind of some instant offense for the or Music 20 to 16 five and a half to go my stovic a twohanded slam ja offensively Syracuse isnt doing anything special theyre just coming off those curls coming off those hands up when they come off they have to look to turn the corner be aggressive and its going to open up that pass just like a repeater John Jake calls a timeout its a twopoint lead for Cornell as Syracuse has gotten into a roll right here well dvo you talked a little bit about kind of how this orange offense has started to flow you think its from guys like Moore well Moore is definitely a guy who could be instant offense Off the Bench hes a guy who could handle the ball and you see Lucas Taylor right here hes doing a good job being patient and finding Peter for the slam its been big for Syracuse today that some of the other pieces are getting involved now JJ Starling has two points Chris Bell just two but its guys like Elijah Moore and Lucas Taylor Peter movich making it work JJ staring is not going to be able to score 26 points every single game who is going to come and help him whos going to be guy to come off the bench to be the spark is it going to be Moore is it going to be Taylor whos the guy thats going to come in and just create opportunities on offense not necessarily score the basketball but just create opportunities for his teammates and you mentioned earlier about Cornells team that a lot of these guys know their role theyve been here for a few years on the Syracuse side where a lot of these guys its its their first year here in Syracuse how hard is it to figure out what your role is so early on its so tough especially with the transfer portal now bringing all these guys in from different places trying to Jael them together trying to get them to buy into a role a lot of these guys were the man where they were theyre at before here so to come in and buy in to a role that coach red wants to have its tough but if they want to win game they have to be able to do that hintons three is short Freeman pushing the pace a spin Freeman on the shot put and he gets it to go for two this is how Syracuse basketball should play they want to be able to push the pace they want to try to create Advantage they want to try to get easy looks and easy opportunities good start for Donnie Freeman kosing from downtown thats short another board for Donnie Here Comes Starling full head of steam and Syracuse takes the lead Jack its nothing special its a full downhill attack getting into the paint and just attacking the rim it almost seemed like early on Syracuse was stunned by Cornells pace and now theyre finally catching up well they were just tenative they werent being aggressive they werent attacking and now you see the difference in when theyre attacking the basket oh car misses the fade away and right back into it pushing the pace Starling goes through his chest its a block on Cornell thats Jake Fegan for the big red see JJ just put your head down and getting into the paint and again youre not going to finish every single time but what youre going to do is youre going to put Cornell in foul trouble youre going to create opportunities for Shooters on the perimeter they just have to stay aggressive Syracuse has to stay aggressive and continue to look to attack the paint Syracuse gets its first lead of the night and if you were listening earlier you probably heard our sideline reporter Shawn dorelis say Syracuse hasnt had a 10 run all season until now an 110 run over the last 2 minutes and 51 seconds this is something they desperately needed desperately needed again they started off slow lethargic no effort no energy coming off a Brooklyn trip that they really played pretty well defensively the effort was there the energy was there offensively yes they could have shot the ball better but coming into a game you know on thanksgiv G Eve you got a good crowd here you want to see some excitement you want to see these guys have some joy to play in the game of basketball this you dont get these opportunities to play in front of this type of crowd all the time you have to bring that energy and you have to bring that effort one thing someone might say if theyve watched Syracuse this season they might say well they play to the level of their opponents why do you think that is if that happens well again I I think you know when youre starting slow and the other team starts off fast it is kind of like a shell shock but you have to be able to shake that off you have to be aggressive on the other end you cant worry about you know if youre making or missing shots Syracuse has finally found its role a fourpoint lead for the orange pet with the slam putting it down JJ get down to The Rim finishing for Music two you got guards like JJ Starling Five Guys on the court that can run the floor it it should be something that they excel at you have shooting you have versatility talked about JJ being able to create for himself and others they should be able to thrive in playing Fast Pace that that is what Syracuse basketball is thats what the Cornell big red are built on as well second in the country with just 14 seconds per possession this season well Syracuse is on a 13 nothing wrong over the last third over the last three minutes well see if they can continue that towards the end of the first half here Taylor to the rack and he gets the floater a good drive by Taylor tough shot tough make but you see Syracuse offensively when theyre moving the ball when when theyre moving bodies theyre getting much easier looks when they isolate two three four dribbles its always ends up being a tough shot Applause Nazir Williams back into the game heres kashian Nicks from the corner gets the three to fall the fourth three ball for Cornell and defensively Syracuse just ball watching not seeing where the shooter is laid on the close out Cornell is going to knock that down every single time Freeman open Lane twoheaded slam s Syracuse has the advantage in oneonone matchups they have the advantage in athleticism they should have the advantage down low in physicality they have to be able to take advantage of these things that they have over Cornell do you think Cornell has just played really tight defense or the shots arent falling I think Syracuse early on they were just out of RI Rhythm they were they were stagnant offensively they had no effort now you see him picking it up a little bit theyre starting to push the pace theyre getting easy opportunities now youre starting to get some confidence going when you have to play in the half court the lead grows to seven its just over two to go open Lane no bucket Freeman on the Applause rebound Donnie with a nice move cant hit the floater and I think Donnie realizes that he could take his man off the dribble every single time Nord from Deep another three for him Cooper Nord a dangerous shooter thats his second thats fifth for the big red Jack thats a second Miss by Elijah Moore defensively we know you can score the basketball but we talked about him being able to pick it up defensively hes talking to Cooper Nord too I dont know if you saw that right there right in his face and I like the talker but he just hit one in your face race as well you have to be able to do it on both sides of the basketball AK car heres Nord downtown Long Scramble for the board and Cornell pulls it down Williams cant hit the shot either on a back door cut Cooper Nord Jack this is effort thats effort defensively theyre theyre standing theyre looking theyre not going after the ball theyre just watching it it seems like with this Cornell team and the amount of ball movement they have is Nice Shot for more they can catch you ball watching sometimes oh they can definitely catch you ball watching they the back door is probably greater than 10 every single game Syracuse has to do a great job of helping on the backside and just being aware foul on the floor its on Nazir Williams a senior guard for Cornell ja dont get me wrong I love the talk I when I played I I was the guy who was talking but you have to be able to back it up you cant just keep trading baskets back and forth at some point you have to string together some stops defensively do you have a favorite guy that you would jaw at through or four years you know what AJ price from Yukon okay was a high high level player and and we had some battles man he was a guy that was not afraid to go back at it with you and I mean the Big East back then it was multiple guys who were talkers but you know hes one guy that really stands out in my mind AJ price you got to be able to back it up thats what Elijah Moores done today he leads the team with 11 points hes three of four from three Freeman knocks down the pair and its a ninepoint lead for the C under a minute to go Syracuse is finally found its Applause stride Raglin from way deep and its well Applause short you see choam more bringing the ball up a little bit more often its good to see other guys bring the ball up other guys handle the basketball besides JC three guard lineup right here with jquan Carlos Kyle cuff into the game and more like you mentioned heres more another three thats short fights for the rebound second chance hes got it to fall following your shot right there great flare screen right there by Davis to get the initial One open well Syracuse started as slow as guys are super talented and theyre more than capable of scoring the basketball second half action on Thanksgiving Eve weve got our Seline reporter sha dorelis with us Jack I spoke to coach Jean Jakes coming out of the half and he told me the key to the second half is finding the balance between pace and patience theyre getting looks up early but theyre not the best quality that he wants to see well thats been the case these past few years for Cornell theyve played really fast towards the top of the country at PACE every season and thats Pace right there guy Ragin pacing the team with nine points and three threes but he said theyve kind of refined their pace and speed that they play at when youre playing at that Tempo the highest Tempo in college basketball its hard to make decisions that quickly so sometimes you have to be able to slow it down so you can make better decisions the orange up by eight heres Davis down low Starling up top to Freeman from Deep long on the three and oar is there for the board Jack you dont want to start the second half off settling for threepoint shots what got you back into this game attack in the rim what should you to start the second half attack the rim weve seen a little bit of both from Starling hes two for 10 and 0 for two from deep and Nas Williams all the way to the bucket for two hes been an aggressor today again just being aggressive putting your head down getting to the cup but no rotation from Syracuse no weak side help Syracuse has to do a much better job of communicating with each other on the defensive side of the basketball and Coach Autreys about to have a pretty quick hook as Peter Movic ready to check in at the scorers table maybe Bell can get an open look instead to Freeman the spin off the glass and a pretty finish from the freshman and great awareness by Donnie just seeing whos on him as a smaller guard just turn around and go right up to the rim and Coach ay changed his mind he sent Peter back to the bench Cooper Nord finishes for two we talked about those back door Cuts theyre going to do it theyre going to get the ball on the elbow and then theyre going to cut right off the ball you have to be aware you have to have that weak side help come over nor 10 points as you see there four of eight from the field 11 a game this season and last time out had a careerhigh 20 in a win over Iona no call on the aggressive take from Starling Nord from Deep he knocks it down Cooper Nord he is a marksman from three bad shot on one end coming back get a train transition look on the other end thats what Cornell wants you to do JJ has to do a better job of going in off the two feet and not going off a oneand attempt and one for Chris Bell he hits the Applause floater JJ going in one hand Cornell just tipping it out of his hands and getting back in transition not something Syracuse has done well Cornell knocking down the transition three weve talked about how Syracuse cess to improve its transition defense and at times it has how much harder does it get when you also have to defend the three ball when youre getting back well yeah but you just have to be aware this is basketball theres going to be Shooters all over especially in the era of basketball now everybody can shoot the ball you have to be aware you have to communicate then you have to run back although Cornells not a big team they make up for it in their threepoint shooting like you said they have Five Guys on the floor that can knock down a three at any time instead of a three a baby hook for guy Raglin he gets two and its a fourpoint game and Regans a guy who hes an inside out guy he can bang if he wants to you seeing right there with the jump hook over the left shoulder and Coach Jake said that guy Raglin is going to be a guy well no pun intended that Cornell depends on all year long one of a couple of seniors on this team Nas Williams being the other that have a big load on their shoulders this year hes a guy who has experience hes poised hes calm he doesnt let little things rattle him no look pass from Starling into an and one for Donnie Applause Freeman good things happen when you move off the ball good job by JJ getting into the lane finding Freeman finishing strong at the rim and Freemans got some confidence in him today 14 points and a lot of these finishes down lower through contact we see hes a slender guy but hes not afraid to go at people well you know what he has a good job of using his length on both ends of the floor but he just has to do a better job of being low and really being physical and embracing the contact 15 points for Donnie Freeman also nine rebounds to go with it and thats a Cornell turnover and another turnover caused by Donnie Freeman having a heck of a game on both ends of the floor doing a good job hedging just making it hard for that guard to turn the corner now Freemans a guy that weve seen play a heavy portions of games but also 10 to 15 minutes in others and it seems like defense will be a key for him to stay on the floor and and for Coach autrey to have trust in him Freeman kicks to Starling gets it right back theyre looking to feed down low now you cut off that Freeman at the hoop a nice finish off the glass and the Freshman stays aggressive we talked about it in recent games whenever Jer Davis gets the ball in the mid post weak side cut exchange cut down the middle just get some movement going you cant be stagnant Noz Williams just two of eight from the field oh for four from three Syracuse has made its last three shots theyll initiate through Freeman who draws a double Starling a nice fake pull up cant hit it here comes beckles one of the fastest guys on this team the trailman Nord knocks down another wow Cooper Nord is keeping Cornell in this game Freeman the other way cant hit the midrange Jay Williams with the board and Cornell is going to push the pace M or Miss H just got lucky right there rimmed out by nordon Bell and transition straight to the hoop nords got the rebound Im attacking the rim Im not going to the side Im going right through his chest right to the front of the rim Cornell has already taken 27 threes now as that one bricks off the re the rim from guy Raglin it just has to be some more toughness some more urgency they hit a shot its going to happen but you have to bust your tail back you have to get ready to play on the other end Davis to the rack lays it off the Applause glass Here Comes Nas Williams slapped on the hand he gets the n one the foul on JJ Starling the pendulum has swung back and forth early in this second half no doing a great job in transition just finding his opportunity and knocking it down and Jer Davis with the straight line drive finishing with the right Music hand Syracuse leads Cornell by six 6 minutes into the second half and the Freshman sensation Donnie Freeman is a big reason why Donnies just being aggressive hes not settling for jumpers hes using his physicality hes using his length hes getting to the rim and hes creating opportunities not only on off offensive side but hes doing on the defensive side as well hedging create making those guards tough to try to turn the corner Donnie Freeman 6 to 13 17 points nine rebounds probably his best game in a Syra Syracuse uniform it seems like so early on in this season hes made a lot of adjustments hes hes gotten better so quickly and Im not saying hes you know reached his full potential by any means but looks like weve seen some jumps early on he definitely has so much room to grow so much room to improve hes one of the most talented freshman in the country the more games he gets under his belt the better hes going to get I think a big thing that Im seeing from Donnie is one hes not settling hes attacking and two hes not getting down in himself when something goes bad yeah Freemans 17 points lead Syracuse heres bell with a short floater that cant hit lamin second chance no and Cornells got the rebound Jack a question I have is how can Eddie lampin insert himself in this BAS game is it going to be rebounding is it going to be on the offensive end he has to be able to bring something to the Syracuse team lanins been limited today just four minutes 0 of two from the field hes not too injured that he cant play but hes a little banged up and wasnt in the starting lineup this evening right now he has a guy guarding him that probably weighs 40 lbs less he has to be able to impose his will and just be aggressive at The Rim AK car aggressive to the rim and he draws a foul on Peter movich hell head to the line for two you know its its been so important that Donnie Freeman has has played well because Starling and Bell combined four of 19 from the field and like you said lampin hasnt done much Applause either fourpoint game after the free throw from oar K whos got three points now as Lucas Taylor and Elijah Moore check in of the game for jquan Carlos and Chris Bell how about AK look at that body hes looking like a tight end or a defensive end in the NFL hes former walkon just a hardworking young man a bright young man whos worked his way on this Cornell team and really one of the top players on this Cornell basketball team more up top looking to extend the Syracuse lead hes already got 13 points tonight the ball cant stick it you cant have five six dribbles you got to continually move the ball you got to move bodies around thats how youre going to get open opportunities lamin pointing up right there I assume that means he wants to pass up well thats yes you want to be a hes a guy that probably isnt going to bend down too much you want to be able to put it up to him where he can catch it and then just go up finish high at The Rim just 3 and 12 seconds to shoot lamin doesnt get fouled it rolls out of bounds well he has to understand he has a size Advantage so theyre not going to call those little Ticky tack fouls right there you have to get lower and you have to be able to create an angle and then just go straight by fourpoint lead for the C foul on lampin looked like a slap on the arm of Ryan kosin just just an undisciplined foul right there just doesnt look super comfortable in this game so far it in both halves hes played now its hard when youve been on the bench for most of the game youre trying to find your rhythm youre trying to come in and bring some value to the team its just hard when its you know youre in and out youre in and out of the game another straight line drive playing off of two feet defense rotated late and thats going to be the result its either going to be a made basket or an opportunity for two free throws at the line oh car going to the line for two dvo you mentioned last time he was at the free throw line that he was a walk on and before he was a walk on he was actually a student manager he wasnt recruited out of high school he made it to Cornell strictly on academics he was the valid Victorian at Clovis North High School School in California so he became a student manager for the team and you know most basketball teams have their managers versus coaches games and and John Jake said he was giving him buckets like he was tring shots and he was the best player on the court so they realized we need to get this guy out there so Oar got a try out made the team as a walk on and in practice they realized again like he might be the one of the best players on this team what an unbelievable story it was funny when we were talking to coach Jake he was saying he was giving me Buckets you know him being a former player he obviously knew that this guy could play and he had a spot on the team and you know he he hes done more than just being on the team hes you know one of the top players on this Cornell team hes got the size too in the ivy league when you know the matchups are big you dont have to have sevenfooters but a guy like him whos 67 240 that can shoot thats a matchup problem against smaller teams and hes skilled he can handle the ball he can pass the ball he could shoot the ball I mean he looks like hes an NFL tight end you know holy cow hes a guy whos going to create a lot of mismatches especially in the ivy league 12 points five assists four rebounds per game those are the averages for o car on the season and theyre also told hes graduating early will have eligibility you know could look to play elsewhere in the future its definitely a bright future for AKO car and he will definitely have some suitors after him fourpoint game 8 minutes its into the second half Syracuse has once again found itself in a razor thin battle inside the Dome Starling comes away with the steal pushing the pace Mo in the corner b Elijah Moore does it again and those are the opportunities that Syracuse wants to get great job by JJ on the defensive side of the ball pushing it getting the easy look for choa Mo knocking it down hint its three short Moores got the board here come the C again no its stolen by fan another three for Cornell its short that time off the finger tips of oake and Taylor gets fouled in the corner Elijah Moore hes been so important today 16 points hes got four threes he is just Fearless for a freshman see JJ great job defensively get ahead to my guy choa Moore elbows up sevenpoint lead for Syracuse over Cornell in the second half big reason why Elijah mois shooting hes just been Fearless Moore is fearless he doesnt let mistakes bother him hes what we call a shot maker I love him getting into it I love him talking trash he has been a Difference Maker in todays game for Syracuse six of nine from the field four of six from three yeah hes a star only as a teenager a freshman but he was a star in high school hes got almost 150000 Instagram followers he became a a sensation and big reason why is that Bullseye tattoo on his elbow if you could see it on some of his made threes like you said dvo elbows up he points that bullseye on his elbow at the opponent and it gives him some more flare I love it it but I met I met Elijah in the summertime and I tell you what one of the hardest working kids that I have ever met he was in the gym in the morning he was in the gym in the afternoon and then you check his Instagram hes in the gym at 1130 at night the kid is the ultimate worker and is paying dividends out here on the floor yeah his dad has echoed the same thing his Dad Tai said hes made a lot of sacrifices you know high school he he wasnt a partyer didnt go out or anything like when Syracuse hosts Miami those are two of the best passers in the country too in cam Ward and Kyle McCord Saturday at 330 pm thats on ESPN and hey if you want to come to the Dome call 888 Dome ticks get your tickets and come by theyre trying to pack this one for a huge send off for the Syracuse football team well here in the dome Wednesday Thanksgiving Eve Syracuse basketball has a sevenpoint lead over Cornell Eddie lanin turns it over throwing it over michs head and Cornell will take over dvo you said one thing that youve noticed as Syracuse has started to push the pace a little bit more and and theyve gotten points in the paint theyve been aggressive going to the hole pushing the pace being aggressive getting two feet in the paint creating opportunities at The Rim creating opportunities for perimeter looks its not complicated Jack you have to be aggressive and you have to be able to make decisions while youre being aggressive darling a guy we highlighted earlier on just two for 12 today but a couple of guys have stepped up with him being quiet theres Lucas Taylor midrange he sinks it second bucket of the day for Lucas Taylor Jack you talked about JJ having a a slow game but really not too H not having a big impact today at all but for Syracuse to be a good team or to be a great team they have to have these other pieces that are playing well the Elijah Moors the Donnie Freeman the Lucas Taylor where can you find your Niche where can you find your role where you can come in and make an impact when youre on the floor Starling the floater little strong Nas Williams pushing ahead oh the way to the hole and he lays it up and in and honestly I have no idea how that happens with surrounded by four Syracuse guys and he just goes right by nobody gives him any resistance to the rim that ends a 70 run for Syracuse over the last two minutes Moore gets a screen midrange jumpers Off the Mark and weve got a foul on the floor looks like its on DJ Nicks of Cornell on that rebound and Jack Ill tell you one thing even though JJ is not having a great game offensively you see right here looks like he had a hook down the arm a little bit coach Jakes not all too pleased with it hes a pretty mild mannered guy getting a little animated there didnt agree with the call hes actually a really great guy we had a great conversation with him before the game he is mild manner he seems laidback and two back door cut by Kyle cuff gives the orange two and grows the lead to nine good to see Kyle cuff get involved going back to that JJ thought hes not having a great offensive game but hes doing a great job of defensively being there and pushing the pace creating opportunities for his teammates cuff hasnt gotten to play a ton this season hes entered the ball game a couple of times here and making an instant impact cuff is a guy whos a great defender great on ball Defender a solid shooter and hes super athletic Raglin goes right by my storage but a little too heavy off the glass and you dont want to start out that that High Jack back out to Taylor Starling the quick fake and now he pulls it back out a hop step freeze up a little bit of space and gets the friendly roll for just his third bucket of the night thats a tough shot right there by JJ but going back to Donnie Freeman you cant start that far out now theyre just bringing the double team right away you got to get the ball in position where he can be effective hes got such nice quick motions that free him up here he goes straight into the body of Raglin just a good shot maker thats what he hes really proven this year and hes really the only guy in the team thats going to be able to create shots off the bounce like that but hes a strong guard he can play through the contact and still have balance going up through his shot and this is clearly not one of his best games but he still has 10 points hes got four rebounds and three assists he finds ways to contribute and like I said earlier he he hes doing stuff that doesnt show up on the stat sheet hes defend ly getting deflection hes getting the ball and pushing it which is creating early opportunities for his teammates Nas Williams hits the three cuts the deficit to eight for Cornell Cornell is not going to go away theyre going to continue to play they know theyre theyre right there Taylor fouled by Cooper Nord that time going up for the layup Taylor with an aggressive take as we head to another media timeout eightpoint lead for Syracuse with under eight to Music go Elijah and then the versatility of Donnie they have really held the Syracuse down tonight vers Corno you know dvo I think sometimes Lucas Taylor headed to the line here for a pair sometimes I think it gets underestimated how much turnover this team actually had from last season you know the only two players that get a solid amount of minutes that were back are JJ Starling and Chris Bell and from last years team theyve had to replace 61 of the scoring and Elijah Moore and Donnie Freeman have shown they can help fill that hole and its still early too I think guys are still trying to figure out their roles figuring out where they fit in in the system and Coach red is still you know changing the lineups a little bit obviously the lineup will shorten as you go forward into the season but you know guys are are just starting to get comfortable and really feeling what they can bring to this team really nice play on defense by Lucas Taylor and when you mentioned the the rotations kind of getting changed around Lucas Taylors in a lot of these games for his defense yeah we talked about what role can he have and and defense is is the role that he can play hes a guy thats versatile he could shoot a little bit he could attack the rim but I think defensively hes is where he can really have a big impact for this team I know you said he used to talk trash you ever stick your tongue out at somebody like that Im not Im keeping my tongue in my mouth I I dont know about all that Ill talking a little bit of trash but heres Taylor midrange knocks it down Lucas Taylor defense into offense exactly Jack I think hes a guy who can really get himself going on the defensive end now he has a little confidence now hes feeling good and you see him hitting a shot down on the offensive side of the ball good to see him three for four with seven points on the night he came into this game three for 12 on the season hes hes doing a good job just moving without the ball cuff doing a good job getting in the paint drawing the defense just finding the open shot or the open player and Taylor knocking down the shot yeah Taylor had an interesting path to get here he began his career at Wake Forest didnt get a lot of playing time so he transferred to Georgia State where he led the team in scoring with almost 15 points a game had seven 20po games and got to come back to the ACC where he said he grew up in the ACC always wanted to play there born and raised in rowy North Carolina and he got his wish getting to come back three for 0 Carri to make it an eightpoint game and theres a whistle on the Music floor looks like just a substitution for Cornell DJ Nicks checking in and Jacob Becks headed to the bench and Syracuse defensively on that possession just didnt communicate guys were lost and you dont want to get lost against this big red team if theyre open theyre going to shoot it and more likely than not theyre going to knock it down Freeman tried to make the pass down low to Movic its kicked out of bounds and dvo yes its an eightpoint lead right now but once again Syracuse has founds themselves in a very close game with an opponent that they probably shouldnt be yeah they probably should be beating this team you know by by 20 25 points but again I I dont want to take anything away from Cornell coach Jakes has done a great job of preparing his team and coming here and just competing at a high level but we talk about the first half and the slow start that Syracuse has having to dig out of that hole and play from behind is something that you dont want to have to do every single game how about that move from tny Freeman tying a career high there with 19 points well Carri of the cup foul beforehand on the floor looks like that ones on Lucas Taylor Taylors First of the game speaking about Donnie Freeman I mean hes a guy we weve been talking about often during the season just a super talented freshman and the more reps he gets the more game experience he has under his belt the better hes going to be and you see on that last possession just pulling that out of his bag hitting a one foot jump shot and you know he has all the talent in the world its going to be fun to see his progression hes starting to look a lot more comfortable on this team the number six overall recruit in the country theres a travel from Cornell another turnover Applause theres Coach K coach Jake mild mannered getting in the refs year a little bit but hes no Dan Hurley by any means he keeps it pretty calm if anyone saw you know those last couple games he is Def I dont think anyone is is is a Dan Hurley but hes a hes an unbelievable coach I mean he must sweat through five shirts a game that that that guy yes hes a winner big time but holy cow he gets heres more step back Jay oh flies in for the board but couldnt get the put back Jam Cornell the other way re ball just short its tipped Freemans got it much better job with Syracuse getting back in transition Donnie all the way to the hoop gets blocked by Kos 10point lead for the orange Taylor tuck defense on Oar and its a foul slapped him on the arm thats Taylors second defensively when you make a guy have to change direction one two times two three dribbles Im tired by the time I get to the rim regardless if hes making the shot or not great job by Taylor just getting up pressuring the ball and making him make a tough play Kyle cuff gets a nice salvation headed to the bench only played five minutes of this one but like you said tough on ball defense and he tries to do everything he can out there if you know your your your minutes are going to be limited make the most of them when you get on the court Kyle cuff did that oh car hits the first of the one and one Syracuses committed seven fouls so Cornell in the bonus well these last five minutes Jack Syracuse just has to be able to take care of the ball get good shots move the ball move bodies and create easier looks for the for themselves for the free throws Jer Davis checking in for the Freshman Peter Movic see Cornell going to a little two three Zone thats pretty familiar for this building that is you should know and there you go nice pass from Freeman to Davis the jam brings it back to a double digit lead if youre going to beat the Zone youre going to beat it from the high post or you going to beat it from the short corner youre going to beat it attack in the gaps they were ready for it right away back door cut by Nas Williams and theres a foul on Applause Syracuse great job JJ just getting into the high po high low feed pretty easy Cornell didnt get back in and its a easy two for Jer Davis and its just something else we get to see Donnie Freeman do today thats kind of been expanded part of his game a great pass right there just a super versatile player I mean he can pass he can shoot dribbling you probably dont want to have him dribbling too much on the perimeter right now but thats a skill that he will continue to get better at and eventually hell be able to play out on the perimeter and handle the ball Nas Williams knocks down the first the highest scoring returner on this team at 11 points a game last year hes got 12 tonight an all ivy league second team player last year honorable mention couple of years ago the senior Guard from nyak New York and the big thing about Coach Jake these guys want to play for Coach Jake they they want to come back in an era where everybody is transferring in and out hes been able to keep his guys as one unit that goes to show what type of Coach he is but also what type of person he is the first year head man has kept a good nucleus together and brought a big group of upper classman back see right now that backside is wide open for Syracuse Davis through contact gets it to fall talked about Davis just being the enforcer sometimes you just put your head down put your shoulder in his chest play off the contact and finish great job by Davis finishing at The Rim o car through the trees passes it out and Raglin hits the three guy Ragin Jr again his fourth three of the night sevenpoint lead for Syracuse four minutes to go dvo are we ever not going to have a back and forth game Jer Davis great job just attacking the rim Cornell is not going to go away Jack you see Raglin knocking down his third triple of the game Applause back inside the Dome Syracuse leads Cornell by seven and yes there was a little bit of a panic early on the big red had an early 12point lead over the orange since the early first half Syracuse has kind of figured out the style of play its needed they got a couple of freshman to step up too big time dvo in Freeman and more yeah the Freshman have been doing their thing tonight but Syracuses has been aggressive overall in this second half 38 paint points 42 rebounds plus 10 theyre just doing a great job of being aggressive and attacking the basket and Syracuse has already matched its season average in rebounding with 42 in this game a mark thats much better than last season an area of struggle the past couple of years but this years squad has has definitely made a big difference under four to go a sevenpoint lead shot clock dwindling double team startling to Freeman goes tough to the paint and gets fouled hes headed to the line Jack we talked about numerous times when Jer Davis gets that ball in the mid post cut see right here JJ just attacking great job finding Freeman and an opportunity for two at the line fourth foul on NAS Williams right there the star guard just one shy the quota you cant be hesitant when youre playing any sport right but when youre playing basketball when youre aggressive what does it create it creates opportunities for yourself it creates opportunities for your teammates and it also puts the other team in foul trouble youre talking about Williams already with his fourth foul 21 points for Donnie Freeman a new career high I know you were an aggressive player you shot a lot of Threes you got to the hoop went downhill but if you ever were tentative or or not necessar super aggressive at any point why might that be I I never been like that I I dont know you just have to have a its a mindset you have to have a Fearless mindset you you cant worry about if you turn the ball over if you miss a shot you have to continue to play because the game of basketball those things are going to happen youre going to miss shots youre going to make mistakes but you have to continue to keep playing and you have to continue to keep playing with confidence it seems like this Syracuse team is kind of just is taking its time to figure out one the identity and two the ability to lock in and and make plays when it matters right now thats not the case just a sixpoint lead and it dwindles to four Nas Williams with an aggressive take playing with four fouls hes not scared I tell you what they have to finish this game but then they have another big game coming up in Knoxville next week they cant be tentative at all in that one you said it off the top must wi game for Syracuse and the the real strange reason that that it is a mustwin game is because we never have to talk about that its been 43 straight Syracuse wins over Cornell and well go to our sideline man Shawn dorelis on whats happened since the last time Cornell beat Syracuse Well Jack a lot has happened you mentioned its been a 43 game winning streak for the orange over big red that dates back to December 4th 1968 20 447 days since but whos counting back then the number one song on the charts was Marvin gaze I Heard it Through the grap Vine the number one song on the charts right now a bar song by shabzi I think I heard that one on your Pregame playlist I might have had that one going I I think you had the Marvin Gay going dorf I have the Marvin Gay going right now definitely Im a Marvin Gay fan absolutely just a fourpoint lead for Syracuse and like we said 43 straight wins over Cornell thats in danger this matchup is not usually very close of those 43 wins just five of them have been decided by single digits you have to give credit to Cornell they they havent stopped playing Syracuse has punched him in the mouth theyve made shots theyve been dominating him in the paint and Cornell is just not going away again it goes to show you what type of team they are and what type of Coach they have just two and a half minutes and a two possession game couple of freshman out there running the show more to Taylor for three fre just short Freeman fights for the board whos it going to be it stays with the orange offensively sir its just stagnant you cant get in those isolations every single time Cornell is boxes and elbows theres four guys waiting for you to attack the paint you have to move the ball you have to move the bodies it sounded like earlier on you likeed their offense best when they werent dribbling a lot Syracuse is at their best obviously when they can get out in transition and get opportunities that way but in the half court you just have to move the ball it cant now you got opportunities you got angles you got Corners to turn get downhill and take advantage of those just five to shoot Starling drives loses control cant get his second chance under two to go Cornell with a huge opportunity big red have made their last three Williams open look B by Taylor what a rejection Applause a game saving block right there that might have been a game saving block right there Jack oh my goodness no helps side Taylor showing his athleticism and more coming down knocking the three that was an unbelievable block shot right there game saving three for Elijah Moore on the other end but that was incredible Taylor just floating all the way up to the rim to keep it for I mean what a SW thats a fivepoint swing right there thats a wide open layup right there Taylor just getting up and he floated he Flo could have called it it was almost a goal but he just got up before you see pushing the pace on the other end after the block shot Elijah Moore has been doing it all night why not do it again knock it down well Cornell calls a timeout because now its a sevenpoint game and just a few seconds ago it was about to be a twopoint game Williams had the open look to the cup a great block by Taylor this has been a good game for him especially on defense its funny how one one play can really change the momentum you know of a whole game you know just that block shot getting out in transition creating that opportunity for Elijah to knock it down who has been outstanding all night Donnie Freeman and Elijah Moore really have been carrying this Syracuse basketball team on the offensive side of the ball dvo imagine the feel in the dome right now if Taylor wasnt there and that was a layup from Williams coach ay probably would have called the timeout it would have been a two point game and these fans probably would have looked a lot more uncomfortable than they are right now well its giving me a lot of Youngstown State field yeah big time you know up up late in the game then they come down and hit two dagger threes to send it in overtime but Taylor was making sure that is not going to happen tonight I mean thats been every game theres been you know no room to Exhale fourpoint win over Le Mo twopoint win over Colgate double overtime against the Youngtown State Penguins those are the wins on the season and Sarah exuse is hoping to add to that tonight currently a sevenpoint lead over the big red and Jack a win is a win but you want to try to find in these games especially some space in between yourself and Cornell so you can you can figure out you know different things to do offensively figure out how guys can come in and play in different roles when you have to play close games like this every single time you really got to stick to what you know and whos on the floor and you really cant find out you know about other things about the players that youre trying to do they definitely want to find space between them and Cornell because right now looks like theres a lot of space between them and Syracuses next opponent Tennessee the number seven ranked team in the country a three ball from Jake fan is Off the Mark Taylors got the board and Syracuse pushes the other way Moore saves a pass an incredibly athletic play to keep it from going out of Applause bounds now this is the time time right here where you hold it for an iso you hold it you go at about eight and you just attack downhill thats going to fall on Starling shoulders all the way to the rack Up and Under Freeman with a putback jam that might just be the Applause dagger Williams for three short Moors got the Applause rebound well Syracuse has been playing with fire all game game long but they picked the right time to make a couple of huge plays and were going to go back and theyre going to go back to that block shot by Lucas Taylor which really ignited the fast break to allow Elijah Moore to knock down that three to separate themselves even more JJ Starling fouled on the other end hes going to the line for a one and one one one JJ struggled a little bit on the season from the free throw line just 67 but tonight Syracuse 13 of 14 a much more promising Mark and really where they should be every single game they shouldnt we shouldnt be talking about Syracuse missing 11 12 free throws they go down to Brooklyn and they have a chance to beat Texas they miss 11 free throws same thing with Texas Tech darling cant hit him both it stays a 10point game going to have to be a quick shot for Cornell let play solid defense without fouling back to a cut by fan my stovic called for the foul hes going to the line for a one and one thats going to be a foul Every Time Peter you just got to keep your hands straight up you cant come down Music Jake fan scoreless so far on the night gets his first one to fall had 15 points last time out was one of the hottest Shooters on this team 11 of 17 from deep in his past three games but today 0 for three from the field Jackie came in as Cornells leading scorer at 15 and a half at a game Syracuse done a great job on him defensively its been a weird game across the board Fegan kind of a noow and then for Syracuse Starling Bell lampin not putting the points up tonight stays a ninepoint game big rebound Freeman and Cornell continues to foul and I dont think its really a huge surprise seeing Freeman in more score the ball like that we know what theyre capable of but maybe to really have this team and put them on their shoulders and and you know in a game I guess youre expected to win but its just great to see other guys step up and Donnie Freeman Elijah Moore have had heck of a game today Cornell calls a timeout in this ninepoint game with 208 on the clock Syracuse has done enough to survive this game dvo but that certainly wont fly next Tuesday when they play number seven Tennessee it will not fly at all if you start slow against Tennessee theyre just going to bury you I mean theyre physical theyre tough defensively they have veteran leadership their point guard Zigler is one of the toughest point guards in the country they have shot blockers they have transfers coming in Chaz lanir whos probably one of the best guards offensively in the country coming from North Florida these guys have to start off fast and they have to continue that throughout the game if not theyre going to go down to Tennessee and get blown out I know one of the biggest issues youve pointed out in a lot of these games is is just that hesitancy is that kind of the biggest thing you got to get through to to stay in a game like Tennessee and get on it early whenever youre hesitant youre going to more likely make a mistake if if Im going to make a mistake Im going to make a mistake being aggressive trying to do something trying to make a play and then you learn from that mistake as you go forward in the game but you cant play basketball being hesitant you cant second guess yourself you have to attack and then you have to see the decision that you have to make Taylor makes it a 10point game two for three from the free throw line tonight hes got eight points a season high for him make it nine and Jack he Lucas Taylor has really been a Difference Maker we talked about the two freshman all night but Lucas Taylor has has had a solid allaround basketball game Nord from Deep his threes long clock continues to quit to to tick just some smart defense to close it out Fegan goes to the rack gets two makes it a ninepoint game and a last second foul well for a moment there Syracuse was going to end with another single digit game and and looks like now theyll finally have an opportunity to win a game by 10 plus well if if Im the fans Im probably a little bit upset if Im JJ Starling Im not too upset Im going to get two more points for myself yeah well you know we talked about how its an off night from Starling but still got 11 points going to the free throw line hoping to get a couple more and maybe not the perfect momentum he needs going into Tennessee but this has been a good stretch of games for him his past three that he really does need to be the guy in a game like that great players when they dont have their offense going find other ways to get their themselves going to get their teammates going and hes done a great job on the defensive side of the ball hes done a great job of pushing the pace and creating opportunities by getting in the lane not only for himself the first teammate well it might have been a scary one but Syracuse pulls it out for a 10point win over Cornell the 44th
