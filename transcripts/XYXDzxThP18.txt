and and he is one double double away from number 70 in his stored Carolina career Lehi controls the opening tip officials this afternoon Ron Gro Doug Surman and Le Cel leh High pick to finish second in The Patriot League behind Colgate they turn it over and RJ Davis will workrate this tar Hills offense to start Davis and B both returning starters the other three starters all transfers Ryan from Notre Dame Ingram from Stanford and loic from Brown payot posting up on perin gets the offensive rebound second chance no good roic had it and it was wrestled Away by Sinclair we get a held ball possession arrow to UNC and interesting on that first possession Lehi decides not to double when the ball ball goes down low to Bott lets see if they stay with that strategy as this game progresses I think they might have to switch that up bot with those two offensive rebounds now the alltime leader at UNCC and offensive rebounds getting title HBO as Harrison England the Stanford transfer gets past the Lehigh defense and speaking with the coaching staff as you take a look after the Lehi starting five but they Phil Ingram is a X Factor guy and you know what bot brings you know what Davis brings but uh if he can give them that third and fourth option offensively they think thats going to be key for the success in their season Bott picked up his first foul and for Lehigh this team is led by its back court keth Higgins and Tyler Whitney sney one of the top back courts in The Patriot League Peril in too easy he had 16 in the opener against Cornell Lehi 0 and two played on Friday lost to Penn State thats beautiful offense by leeh high that time pick and roll the outside defense for North Carolina late heres Higgins lehis top scorer a season ago now Jaylen Sinclair 55 and brown to point guard Higgins from 15 rebound po already three PS loic the brown transfer feeding P to turnover and here comes Tyler Whitney Sydney nice move nice feed inside and Lehigh rewarded with the foul you can see early on Lehigh that time again attacking of the perimeter trying to get the ball in the paint and thats going to be key for North Carolina stopping dribble drives Lehi their picked to finish second in The Patriot league and their strength is their back cour so thats going to be key this afternoon for North Carina in particular the perimeter players theyre going to have to keep these guys out of the paint oh we saw Monday against Radford as bouay Momo steps to the line a Radford especially in that first half was able to get inside the paint get a lot of shots in the painted area that game was close until North Carolina pulled away in the final 5 six minutes heres Davis us the screen from bot and he knocks it down a 16 point per game scorer a season ago and thats all set up by Bott screen when we spoke with Coach Hubert Davis he said Bott yeah everybody talked about his rebounding and his points they should but hes an excellent screener that time he freed Davis up beautiful screen something under talked about in his game he sets excellent screens to set his teammates up Davis looking to push Lehi gets back with concern Mountain Hawks today transition defense Davis separation Music and watch this beautiful offense in his rhythm cross to the right and then pull up Pern from the outside in and out a rebound to Harrison engr former P 12 freshman of the year at Stanford slips acock calling for it down low watch this match up H there are banging around and theyre staying home on him theyre not helping Ryan left to a pit short Here Comes Tyler Whitney Sydney block to the rim by bacock comes back to pery to Applause shoot Higgins had a 23point game Friday against pen St shot clock into single digits Higgins against Davis has a size Advantage turns another rebound that is five already for bacock heres Ryan hesitation off the window and two shots Applause coming and here right look at the cross to the right by Davis beautiful offense not bad Diva thats a guy that can get his shot off and then the defense by Armando Bott that time on the help side blocking the ball and I think the key thing in that kept the ball in play to try to give his team a chance to gain possession the last foul is on HUB Moma the sophomore from Unionville Connecticut as first for M Ryan we saw him a lot in the ACC Hook when he played at Notre Dame 25 years old 12 points a game G last season excellent Defender he also gives North Carolina threepoint shooting an area they struggled in last year I think all those things check the box experience a guy that can knock down threes and I think underrated off the bounce as well too hes a guy that like RJ Davis shop clock winding down hes a guy thats not afraid to put it on the floor and play off the bounce and you know you look at that starting five that hbert Davis went with and those guys combined for over 450 a game so again a lot of experience in starting unit well we get our first look tonight at Elliot kadoo The Freshman lot of expectations hes a pass first point guard Higgins hits the jumper and cadell who controls we classified to join this team a season early so there was no waiting for kog he got there Applause early Le one of the better guards in the Patriot League thats a beautiful pullup jumper hes a guy that could definitely get it done on the offensive end but right now early on North Carolina with the threepoint lead against Applause Lehigh Auto Owners ures your car because sometimes something from out of left field your team looks like year in year out in the age of the poor Caleb love leaky Black Pete n Puff Johnson Dantes Styles among seven transfers who left North Carolina but transfer portal take it they also giveth yeah and I think I hit on it earlier the experience uh that coach Hubert Davis was able to bring in over uh 300 combined gains for these guys right here alone uh as key transfers I think the big one though for me uh cormack Ryan you know what hes going to get hes been around uh the ACCC a lot of guys uh know him but I think Withers and Ingram I think those two guys are kind of the The X Factor guys if they can give them production and particular whether its coming off the bench I think thats going to be key for North Carolina in particular when you talk about V and then you Davis setting his rotation yeah and Ryan Withers and w three guys that can knock down the threepoint shot Ingram is somebody who can defend pretty much any position on the court a lot like leaky black but more versatile offensively yeah I think thats the key thing for the spacing we talked about Bon as we take a look at a three by Higgins again I talked about one of the better guards in the Patriot League thats a deep contested three hes a guy that can fill it up thats going to be key for North Carolina they dont want to let him get it going early in this game the answer at the other end by Ingram on Q the former McDonalds allaman who was originally recruited by Roy Williams yeah and again great great spacing Lehi right now not doubling again whether its bot or Ingram theyre staying home playing straight manto man thats a beautiful spin move take the hit and finish second foul on Momo threepoint play unsuccessful Higgins has five of the nine for Lehi M Hawks with a couple of Subs in there the Whitlock the freshman Applause B chevar in there as well here is kadu he lines up a three way off and it was last Touch by Jaylen washhington and and when we spoke with Coach Davis yesterday he said defending the threepoint line against Lehigh was going to be huge and they struggled against Penn State only made three uh threes in in that game but he knows Lei is a team that is capable of knocking down threes in particular their back for players early on theyve been able to knock down some this is an area though where Lehi had some issues in the second half against P State just getting the ball across they struggled handling Penn States pressure Higgins back iron rebound RJ Davis Carolina pushing pull up by Davis and thats seven for RJ and his footwork some of the best in college basketball he does a great job onew right up into his jumper squared up and thats a thing of beauty when he gets it going from the perimeter thats great transition offense Whit loock Up and Under Davis was out of bounds as he was scalled on the floor its back to Lehigh right here again getting after it Lehi early on yeah his right on the line good job this officiating crew veteran crew and all about positioning when youre like officiating these games Ron Grover Doug Surman and Lee Cel right in position to make that call Cam Gillis out to Higgins whos got seven carrying his hot hand from Friday 23 vers Penn State and again a guy that is going to be in discussion for player to year in The Patriot Music League this back court tandem K and Davis you get the sense youre going to see a lot of these two playing together Kad again Lehi daring him to shoot and hes taking the bait hes more of a passer that really plays into Lehi uh they want him trying to attack the paint thats been an emphasis this year for North Carolina obviously tried to get out play a little faster but uh that I dont think is a strength of his game yet they rather have him trying to get into the paint and either find opportunities for his teammates or get the ball into the paint trying to score for himself the big thing for Carolina this year just finding more chemistry on court off the court this was a team two years ago well documented made the run to the national championship last year preseason number one missed the tournament and Caleb love and Armando Bott never could seem to get on the same page a year ago love has transferred out and again Kad being that pass first point guard none of the coaches none of the players are going to say the quiet part out loud but the reality is guys want to play with somebody whos going to share the ball yeah again thats really his strength his passing ability setting his teammates up I think thats going to be key as this season progresses Withers the Louisville Transfer shows you what he can do ke theme again attack back of the basket thats a beautiful drive and finish that time by with with the left hand roic guarding Whitlock Higgins has seven for Lehigh chevar no good on the three bacock back in there grabs the rebound inside to withs out to kadoo inside the arc and he hits his first F goal and thats better at that time they were daring in the sh the three you dont have to let it fly work it in a little closer good decision that time by the Freshman Kota a foul with 1149 to go in this first half North Carolina with a 174 lead on Lehi wuk picks up his first attention Walmart shoppers heres some straight talk for you use your loved ones to save money on wireless so you ready to commit to two lines to save cash have you ever saved your parents anything now congratulations on your future savings whats important in life family and saving money right and not necessarily in that order more lines mean more savings with straight talk just 25 each other they get along as a group as you take a look at the resume for Hubert Davis and I think thats key I think though the big thing for them threepoint shooting last year they were uh at the bottom half of the ACC and the country in three point field goal percentage of this year I think thats going to be huge and particularly when you have a player like B can you space the four with shooters 31 from three last year Carolyn on bot whos got one foul shot clock down to two down to one and AR bot already with six rebounds in this opening half Withers looking to get Baseline spun back posting up the Fall Away too strong thats a great job of blocking out that time by per he didnt get the he tipped the rebound out but he kept Armando B off the glass and thats something coach talk to us about before this game they must have keep bot off the offensive l block going to his right gets around wji and Paxon woic picks up his second Music foul roic has the headband for a reason before Mondays opener he needed 10 stitches took an inadvertent elbow to the forehead during shoot probably not the way you want to start the season later today womens college basketball triple header on accn number 17 Louisville and to Paul at 4 Davidson taking on the uncom and then the evening is capped off with Team USA and Duke in an exhibition game and more on the stitches Ro ho Davis said thats something thats never hes never experienced as a player take a look at him two by The Freshman Kau he is smooth hes going to be a good one Elliot cadell the ACC preseason Rookie of the Applause Year harn brings bot out to the perimeter shot clock again in single digits a long three no good by Whitlock Gau quickly up ahead to Ryan down low bacock great position gets his follow and one and it wont show up in the Box SC but the pass by cor M Ryan sets up that play for bacock again their transition hit ahead corm Ryan right to Bott coming down and thats another area that Bott does a great job running to the rim thats beautiful transition offense by North Music Carolina when youre an undersized team like Lehi its almost not fair when he catches the ball that low yeah and and thats a design play and something that North Carolina wants to do this year play a little bit faster be opportunistic in the transition game this is going to be key them too right here the pressure how does Lee High handle the pressure when North Carolina picks up they struggled the other night Friday against P State JT Ts a big body 42 in there he can set scream tan down low has a size Advantage kicks it to the corner Whitney Sydney dribble drive around bacock sco not there Ingram the other way hes a Swiss army knife leans in no good tan almost lost the rebound out of bounds Whitney Sydney again over bacock altered 10 rebounds in the first half with 927 to go for Armando Bott its just amazing I mean already the leader in rebounds and this story hes on base for 40 rebounds tonight I mean most guys dont get 300 rebounds 400 rebounds for their career this guys got over 1300 again I said it in the tip his jersey will be in the rafters when he leaves North Carolina one of the most productive and dominant rebounders in college basketball uncs alltime leader in rebounds alltime leader in double doubles and we get a foul on the floor its jt1 his first early in the game Lehigh theyve done a pretty good job perin in particular on Bop theyve stayed home lets see if they stick with this strategy where they start doubling up Carolina starting to play more through number five Bott against tan got tied up jump ball possession arrow Applause leh thats not bad defense again typically if he catches it that low he just barrels his way down hes underneath in that restricted area normally hes going to store but thats actually theyve been let him play its been physical with the bigs early on theyve been consistent with that Ts a big body hes got 40 lb of girth on bot good defense by Ryan Tan using his body too strong to Ryan grabs the board third stop for Cormac Ryan started at Stanford then Notre Dame now UNC Bott spins inside tan falls down count the basket well here Lehi youre going to have to probably change that strategy up hes just good right now to go single coverage right here they stay home because of the spacing excellent for North Carolina and if youre North Carolina you got to continue to go to that matchup and particular if theyre staying single coverage tan has the weight to body with Bott down low but botts the better athlete and I think too again youre talking about a guy thats uh up there on the alltime list in terms of points uh and this story uh program uh thats a tough matchup I think for anybody but in particular The Bigs of Lehi again theyre going to have to probably change that up and send somebody or at least with the do try to slow him down a little UNC on a 12 one run Armando Bott six points 10 rebounds in this first half t to the bench with two fouls Henry adasu 611 240 lb from Cameroon in at Center bacot gets a breather as well for UNC this is Ben kosman started 16 games last year gives it up to Higgins kosman out to Sinclair shot clock down to three Whitney Sydney the corner three doesnt go and that is going to be out of bounds to UNC and Lehi in a bit of a scoring drought here one for their last 11 and they had a good look on that possession excellent ball movement they got some dribble penetration got a pretty clean look just unable to convert and youre trying to pull off the upset on the road as you take a look at Co have so much success at this Lei program you got to have to knock down some of those open looks when you get them that is doct to you Dr Brett re thank you for correcting me and really enjoyed our time speaking with him before the game was such a great job bringing guys in the key thing we talked about the transfer portal he doesnt lose a lot of guys once he brings them to Le High telling us when guys commit to Lehi theres an investment in being able to graduate in academics in education they have one transfer on the team and hes from division three Bowden College shout out to the polar Bo Zaden High looking for his first points as a Tar Hill almost got him there guitar Hills have a 10point lead with 723 to go in the opening Applause Music half lehis last win against an AAA round one CJ McCollum and the mountain Hawks took down Duke 7570 Lehigh was a 15 seed Brett Reed was the head coach and the beat Duke shirts popularized by the UNC faithful they added a word to the top of it and he shared a great story uh with us about Roy Williams uh after that game said anytime youre in North Carolina make sure uh I take you out for some dinner said he didnt think it would be appropriate right here but he needs to hit coach Williams up for that dinner what a performance though by CJ M as The Story Goes the team that had the floor before that Lehi Duke game was North Carolina and you know the history between Carolina and Duke so when leehi started hanging with Duke and an upset looked probable all these fans wearing Carolina blue turned into leehi fans and said those fans turned that into a home game for Lehi crowd got behind the mountain Hawks they beat Duke and Roy Williams said hey anytime youre back in town I got you for a sandwich he got to get a stake with that one P Ryan knocks down to three hes got four second three of the game for UNC and I think thats underrated hes just not a catch and shoot guy excellent Defender we talked about his experience corat Ryan is a guy that can play off the bounce as well too very few holes in this game thats a big pick up for this North Carolina team I will say thats a two here comes paralin shot clock again down to two they got to shoot it Higgins does and hits well Higgins has come as advertised and thats not bad D thats just a guy again Im going to say it youre not familiar with the Patriot League they got some pretty good teams and hes a guy thats going to contend and be in the discussion all year long for player to year shot clock winding down and he can go get you a bucket jum ball Ryan a pretty good Defender thats a contested deep shot clock winding down and hes in a couple of those today already 10 points for Higgins who leads all scores he was lehis leading scorer Friday with 23 at Penn State 15 a game a season to go to lead the mountain Hawks as well RJ Davis from the corner hes got s thats just too easy thats a break down commun B RJ Davis too good footwork set play underneath no help and thats shooting practice right there beautiful execution by North Carolina on out of bounds underneath Arn the senior against the Freshman Zaden High shot clock down to five down the lane Runner not there for Joshua Ingram UNC quickly the other way Davis gets it back from Ryan 13 for RJ Davis his third three and a timeout re thats a clinic on how to run transition offense uh ball barely touches the ground Give It Up to cormack Ryan back to RJ Davis for a three ball North Carolina is rolling right Music now Music being the best takes hard work it takes early mornings planning Precision sweat sacrifice and teamwork thats why Old Dominion Freight Line the number one National LTL carrier for Quality works hard to be the best in the game and is proud to support those striving to be the best in their game Old Dominion Freight Line helping the world keep promises a game High 13 for RJ Davis three threepointers on four attempts hes a streaky player but when hes on this is a different offense yeah and I I think its how hes getting those looks theyre clean looks we talked about the out of bounds underneath no help by Wei but in transition again you can see the emphasis they want to be opportunistic in their break you cannot run transition offense any better than that last possession unselfish ball barely touched the ground and then RJ Davis with a wide open look on the throwback from forat Ryan Ryan defending Higgins now bot out to meet perin cam Gillis The Freshman from the outside you said it look we have to defend the threepoint lineman we talked to him uh yesterday he said thats right at the top of the list for us that was the first thing he said we have to defend the threepoint line you surprised that they have not doubled much when the ball goes into Bott well its worked again perins done a pretty good job again hes I think been pretty under control but this area right here for reive has been a problem angram swoops to the Applause bucket def def veteran against greenhorn as Davis was matched up with Gillis this is Joshua Ingram played of St Joes High School in mouin New Jersey pretty good alumni list there a dozen for Higgins and the guys that came from Joshua Ingrams high school as North Carolina turns it over Andrew bam Carl Anthony towns Jay Williams the guy who says were halfway there didnt graduate but went there for two years on number 19 North Carolina not a lot of cupcakes on this nonconference slate for the tar Hills and I like that again veteran group talked about the chemistry with this team anytime you bring in a new group Core Group end but uh those guys that he brought in all have experience so I would not be as concerned doing that with guys that have experienced already at the Collegiate level to is back in along with Davis Bott Withers in England Pern from the outside how about Dominic Pern senior mat manger four student in high school already hit some threes this year he was 0 for8 from three last year watchs the battle away from the basketball between him and B tell you both those guys are going to be sore tomorrow they bang physical Davis ahead of the P has it taken away by Gillis Davis gets it back B to Kad Withers better than 40 from three last year instead the running hook Withers there on clean up Duty thats his great second effort that time by Withers all set up though by peock tipped it to him it is a very very small sample size not even two games in you can already tell there is just more of a connectivity on the court of the heels I think Define roles I think thats key in this one right here everybody accepting and knowing what their role is hains the step back and one thing youll see from Hubert Davis especially early on theyre still mixing and matching with lineups trying to figure out what the best combinations are and we asked him the other day about the rotations again that was something uh again third third year end the rotation figuring that out will you go more than 67 and he said look I got 11 guys I got 11 starters and I think because of the guys he brought in it gives him the ability to be versatile in his lineups he can go big he can go small and the key thing is is hes added some perimeter shooting one and one one for Bott that was the seventh team foul for third B Moma youre going to see a lot of that this year when Carolina faces teams who have trouble matching up down low big guys for the opposing teams getting in foul trouble early eight points 12 rebounds for Armando B here in the first half I mean he might have a double double he probably will before this half gets out thats just crazy but hes on his way to another double double again typically youd say Hey you know second half were not we got 228 to go in the first half hes almost got a double double and hes put up those numbers in 12 minutes and hes got some rest here in the first Applause half K guarding Whit L freshman against freshman Ingram the wing three got Joshua Ingram Lei hling around thats a great action theyve been getting clean looks again pin Downs communication needs to be better for North Carolina on some of these pin downs and also ball screens Withers has it roll out half of Le Highs shots have been three six of 15 40 from Deep theres of three thats good Burke chahar hes the Bowen College transfer senior from marota Georgia first points of the Applause Season K left it short rebound to Joshua Ingram and Lehi has cut this thing to seven and scored six straight Harin battle for the board Che AAR not there and here comes kdo kdo B pass B fouled oh heres his chance to get the double double and thats a beautiful find that time by Koo in traffic right here crossover beautiful Court vision and thats something that the coaching staff and Hubert Davis really Rave about this young man right here Elliot cadell The Freshman highly recruited coming out and they just Rave about his passing ability on display right there with that play Beautiful find for Armando bot Kau had six assists in the opener against Ratford I like how Hubert Davis put it he said he genuinely loves to pass and to see others score and that can be infectious for a team yeah in this day and age thats a very rare most of the times guys are worried about their points points per game and definitely not that tight player Armando Bott has just recorded his 70th career double double in the history of the ACC theres only three players with 70 or more double doubles its bot its the great Ralph Samson and the great Tim Duncan and in simply put set in and open his jersey will be and these Raptors when he leaves with takes a rebound away from Applause bot Armondo inside against perin no double and thats a dozen to go along with a dozen boards thats not bad defense by Pern thats just a beautiful reverse pivot and then finish with the left hand that time by bot still continue to stay single coverage when the ball gets entered into post to B Whitlock works against kdo Whitlock was Mr basketball in the state of Minnesota last year final seconds first half Trimble in the passing Lane Higgins gets it back got to put it up Higgins and trap it and it Music counts hes in there for Bou Moma who had three fouls in the opening half Sinclair to paralin spins it around the rim and here comes RJ Davis this 13th rebound to Bott Bott has one threepointer in his career on 16 attempts Higgins picks up Davis bot fell down underneath Davis teardrop gets his own Miss back out to Ingram three rims out comes back to Ingram again down low Ric blocked by chahar and Lehigh controls and thats great recovery by chbar looked like wji was going to have a open layup came out of nowhere blocked it and the key thing kept it in play and gained possession for Lehi Jaylen Sinclair went over the 100 assist Mark last time out paralin front rim rebound number 14 for bot Davis Falling Away another second chance for UNC Davis jumps up hes got 15 with a chance to make it 16 oh thats a great read by RJ Davis he has the big parin out on him just clear it out let him go to work nice little jump stop let him fly by and one and interesting conversation we had with uh coach Davis about RJ Davis he said look hes the the only guy in practice that gets the call one time out so he said look if the guys arent getting after in practice I said you get one time out RJ Davis is the only one that can do it to kind of rally the guys said hes only had to do it one time it speaks to his leadership hes the guy that theyre looking for and they said hes been more vocal this year taking on that leadership role thats something CH in his senior season he hits the free throw one of best free throw shooters in the ACC and statistically the best in the history of Carolina basketball Ryan rips the rebound away from the 68 280 lb to tan Ingram from the Baseline rebounded by Higgins Whitney Sydney has been quiet today just the presence of Bot made that shot so much tough even though it went in Im not sure how he got that one degree of difficulty off the chart that was high up off the glass with his left hand oh right now Carolina just killing Lehi on Second Chance opportunities but an offensive foul called on Applause engram Lehi hanging around I think thats the best way I could describe it theyre doing a great job just when you think North Carolinas going to try to stretch the lead they make a play that time coming up with a huge charge and trying to cut it back down the single digits on this possession Keith Higgins has been most of the offense for Lehi Tyler Whitney Sydney their second leading score and part of that Dynamic back court that last field goal his first points of the game pull up is good by The Freshman Gillis theyre hanging around they were down the half deficit now eight theyre really high on the Freshman leaving some great minutes off the bench against Penn State in his first game and thats a beautiful pullup jumper under control they play through Bott bodies up against ham using the window 14 for Armando Bott if Im North Carolina right now every offensive possession down Im giving him a touch just play bot forced Lehigh to make a decision no need to shoot jumpers isolate him on the wing and then let him go to work chahar backs down Ryan Tan for the easy Applause Music two Ingram posting up on chevar and will get a blocking foul on chevar he tried to pull the chair out that time took the first hit and then pulled the chair out moved himself back and see that time takes it and right there yeah thats again he could have easily called maybe potentially a flop on that one again the way theyve been banging around all afternoon I really impressed though with the Lehi bigs again thats a lot to ask under size at times when youre going up against Bop but theyve done a good job thus far playing very physical with this North Carolina team now the expectation for Lehi is to compete for a patriot League Championship Colgate is the team to beat in that conference and they have owned that League theyve won it four years in a row Colgate the favorite this year again leh High picked second and I think the the issue balance right now again its similar to what they had with Penn State Higgins was the only guy in double digits in that game same thing in this one now its been spread out out a little bit you had seven different guys hit threes in that first half but I think uh can they get that second and third offensive uh guy going for this Lehi team tough to depend on just one guy to give you all the production and the guy they need to be that second guy is the one inbounding Tyler Whitney Sydney the Junior from Somerville Mass 4 for 13 against Penn State 1 for seven today is seeing some more minutes today after putting up seven points in the Penn State game the go back in there for UNC threepointer no good Armando Bott with the car Zaden High another freshman is in there for UNC Bott through traffic got and thats great Patience by that R again didnt give it up too early sometimes guys would try to throw that in traffic he just waited long enough to throw that ball to Bott thats excellent offensive Patience by Ryan and then he shows off his defensive chops up ahead pass deflected Bott didnt see it had his back turned Gillis Catch and Release good and Lehi cuts it to eight you can see why they are high on this freshman thats excellent transition offense and on the road again and buries a three to keep this thing with N Signal digits for Lehi RJ Davis cannot answer offensive rebound and it does not fall for Zaden High when we come back the Freshman from San Antonio Zen High to the free throw line hell try to get his first points as a Tar Hill pants on in the morning Im just like everyone else except I make gold records thats Armando Bott this year every time he gets suited up for a game it feels like hes going to break some kind of record past somebody on some list today he moves to 11th in UNCC history on the scoring list passing Marcus pagee whos on the Carolina bench I mean its just a phenomenal the career that Armando Bott has had and you take a look at that bench that he has at solvan Shawn may Marcus Paige and look Armando Bott that Jersey will be up in these Rafters when he is done what hes been able to accomplish here at North Carolina the numbers just dont lie theyre just massive what hes been able to put out in terms of production and no one will accuse him of not enough cowbell either Zaden High cracks the scoring list so you got Bott number 11 all time for Zaden High thats his first point as a Tar Hill make it two I think he is going to be another guy again Off the Bench giving uh hbert Davis the luxury of a depth and I think of these minutes early on we talked about their out of conference schedule theyre going to need a depth and I think he is going to be a key piece in particular if you have a guy like Bott in foul trouble or you want to give him some rest uh the production that he gives them off the bench is going to be huge for the Carolina season Whitney Sydney knocks it down thats a three hes got five Carolina turns it over Gillis almost traveled Ryans a terrific Defender and on the Baseline Gillis draws the foul all of a sudden a sevenpoint game and thats a smart play that time by the Freshman gills he could have easily Jack that three up would have been a contested one let me take it Ill give you a head fake and then try to dribble drive and kick to somebody else you get a a foul but Lei right now again making good decisions with the ball and the key thing is theyve handled the pressure and not turned the ball over against North Carolina Higgins over Bott its good and Le High down by five Keith Higgins again youre not familiar with the Patriot league but he has got one of the most lethal pull up look at the elevation that time Bott late on the help and hes a guy First Team all League last year hes going to be into discussion for Player of the Year this year having another phenomenal game on the road at North Carolina adasa had picked up the foul for Lehigh Carolina cant connect we get another foul this time against Lehi adasa again moving pick fivepoint Advantage for UNC they led by nine at the half Lehigh has outscored North Carolina in this second half threepoint shooting has been the difference tonight Lehigh 9 of 22 Carolina 3 of 13 they go to Bott trying to play bully ball rebound to Gillis Lei can make it a one possession game with a basket here under best players has it Tyler Whitney Sydney throws it up to a theim hes got seven five in the second half and the mountain Hawks pull to three and another foul underneath I think they got adasa again who is coming to the game and just fouled and what hes trying to do is establish a position early in terms of keeping Bott out of the paint you dont want to let him catch the ball with two feet inside the paint so hes trying to battle him beforehand yeah that right there again hes trying to get around and Bott trying to get the ball there but again if he catches it with two feet in the paint a lot more difficult to defend him so he TR to push him outside of the box and checks in number 42 for Lehi Here Comes Davis to the basket and hes able to draw the foul Two Shots coming RJ Music Davis third foul on 10 and lehis got to be careful 1310 to go second half youre already in the bonus you put Carolina in the bonus and youve got one of the best free throw shooters in the league at the line Fridays ACC PM with Mark Packer and Taylor tanon bom will come to you from Atlanta they get ready for college football Saturday Syracuse and Georgia Tech The Prime Time game starts at 4 Eastern that game right here on accn Saturday at 8 Eastern last night Thriller at Keenan UNC in double overtime claiming the victory bell knocking off Duke tan looking for help shot clock at 10 puts it on the floor now Higgins Falling Away does not go offensive rebound was there perin lost it Davis pushes Davis D malane kick out kdo Bott down low no double Bott against perin yes the friendly roll and thats great spacing by North Carolina excellent play that time by Kad getting the ball to bot and then the sping was there Whitney Sydney Cleaves down the lane tipped to Kad The Freshman pushing great move and he is Applause fouled well arando Bott had a double double in the first half one of the more dominant players in college basketball leading Lehigh 1155 to go second half Anish Ro Malcolm hucke happy Sunday UNC football big win last night UNC basketball looking to follow it up second game of the season for the heels they beat Radford on Monday and Armando Bott 18 points 16 rebounds today his 70th career double double third all time in the ACC if youre judged by The Company You Keep man that is Elite uh Elite probably a understatement uh I mean youre talking about two of the best to arguably do it not just in the ACC but in college basketball and he is right there with him and I would not be surprised matter of fact Im going to go out in Lim Im thinking he may be number one when he leaves North Carolina so hes at 70 he would need 18 more over the balance of the season to catch Duncan or pass Duncan hell have a shot I I mean look hes a guy that averaged the double double last season and last two seasons and the way that he is doing it right now hes a better version of what he was last year I would not be surprised to see him have a double double in every North Carolina game that he plays in remember two years ago he had 31 double doubles which tied David Robinsons NCAA record RJ Davis using the screen from bot shoots over Whitlock RJ Davis wor 20 points and speaking with rubert Davis yesterday he said thats a part of botts game thats underrated again RJ Davis gets credit for the two but he said poock set some of the best screens and that right there was an example of one of them he freed up RJ Davis to have a clean look off that pick and roll k through the contact hes got Applause seven Whit Rock puts an end to a 90 UNC Music run Lehi uses a timeout 1035 to go in the second half Mountain Hawks got close North Carolina his cushion back up to 10 North Carolina but in his life and certainly what a life it was that he led impacted so many Beyond of the North Carolina family he was a tremendous offensive player but his defense one of the best on ball Defenders that this league has Music seen Harrison Ingram against Joshua Ingram and its Harrison who wins the namesake battle rber Davis has to be pleased with that offensive possession that time they were very patient they didnt settle for a jumper that time work the ball into the paint thats been a strength for them right now theyve dominated the paint 28 point paint paint uh points for North Carolina only 12 for Lehi Seth Trimble and Jaylen Washington couple of sophomore holdovers out there Ingram hits the corner three hes got a dozen to go along with six boards and UNC extends to a 15point Applause Music Advantage time out on the floor 93 total by Verizon is Wireless that goes all in for you that means unlimited data powered by Verizon priced by us for just 25 a line no contracts no credit checks sounds pretty hard to beat but all in is all in so we added Disney Plus premium on us so rides are a little more because it cant be total unless its all in total by Verizon now for a limited time get a free Samsung Galaxy 813 5G when you switch only at total by Music Verizon Harrison Ingram was brought in as a transfer from Stanford couple of years ago he was the Pack 12 rookie of the year he brings a lot of Versatility you lose an elite and premium Defender like leaky black Harrison Ingram can guard almost any position on the court offensively he gives you a lot more I think that last play really sums it up his ability to knock down jumpers you I think thats going to be a key theme for North Carolina a team that really struggled shooting the ball from Beyond The Arc last year again starting off the season its early they havent shot it particularly well well and this game theyre 44 from the threepoint line but theyre going to have to knock down those open jumpers that time thats a good sign off with great ball movement to get a wide open Corner three Whitlock over Seth Trimble whose calling card is his defense as well Withers the Louisville Transfer down low Jaylen Washington hes got that 74 wingspan working the baseline kadoo from the outside back iron and Elliot Kad now 0 for three from Deep lets see with this lineup in right here no Bott no RJ Davis lets see if North Carolina can keep this lead a block by Trimble Seth Trimble a gall as a sophomore out of Wisconsin boy if he can give you any kind of offense you can dream on the type of player he can be yeah right here again great uh defense that time not giving up on the play but problematic though again in this game the guards of Lei have been able to break down North Carolina off the bounce thats been a big reason why theyve been able to hang around in this game theyve been able to get into the paint and then get some wide open look from Beyond the perimeter and we saw Radford do a lot of that Monday as well another steel RJ Davis whos back in there Davis with Washington Withers tremble and Music Ingram Ms in there for Lehi with the three fouls Davis against Whitney Sydney creat separation and thats 22 for RJ Davis weve seen him do that a couple times in this game hes able to stop on a dime and then raise up for his jump ER thats just a beautiful midrange Applause pullup Sinclair the point guard of this offense guarded by the much taller Withers drives on Withers trying to use the quickness Withers may have gotten a piece rebound Ingram one thing we have not talked about in E this game for Lehi fatigue remember they played Penn State Friday night Grove had a practice at T at 1030 the next morning on Saturday and then came to North Carolina so I think fatigue may play a role in this game but one guy that is not tired is this dominating in the paint Second Chance points its because of big number five really I mean thats really been the storyline of this game you look at the second chance points the rebounding that is huge that was a concern for Coach Reed coming into this game you talk about the fatigue factor I think if there is a question mark though still out there for North Carolina a threepoint shooting I think thats uh going to be a theme four of 15 today 26 from the threepoint line that number is going to have to improve as they get deeper into the schedule we already talked about their nonconference slate one of the toughest in college basketball UNC able to get the ball back after Trimble missed the free throw Ingrams got a dozen working on a much smaller Gillis offensive rebound B with the put back so thats 20 points 18 rebounds it is the 21st 2010 game for Bott if he gets a couple of more rebounds itll be his third 2020 game of his career I mean it just to think about that I mean its just almost like you expect it when he gets out there hes just going to get a double double and I dont mean this to diminish his accomplishments but hes made it look so routine it doesnt even feel like a big deal when he does it no it really Applause doesnt heut exclamation thats a beautiful post entry pass by RJ Applause Davis theyre going to get Trimble with a reach in going for the steel and this is all set up look at the postentry pass thats a beautiful angle by RJ Davis the gamble that time by perin and then B finishes the rest the outside was not there and again all set up by excellent floor spacing by North Carolina you have to defend a guy like RJ davidon excellent recognition by North Carolina theyll get the foul on Withers instead his first Moma rebound by B so 22 and 19 now they had an open three if he took one and made it this place would have exploded anding and deing on the inside speaking with the coaching staff they think he could be an XA Factor guy for North Carolina hes been impressive I think in the post hes got the ball close and then hes been able to finish Trimble the other way was trying to catch a body instead hell get to two shots at the other end Bott picked up his 20th rebound so thats his third career 20 point 20 rebound game Bott looking like uh Luke May that time on the outlet pass thats a beautiful long pass by Bott and look at the numbers today I mean just rolls off hey you know just another 2020 game for Armando vot his third and his career you just dont see numbers like that at any level a guy who started 130 plus career games just to give you a quick snapshot of what Bott has done today he broke Tyler hansboro career record for most offensive rebounds at UNC he picked up his 70th career double double third 2020 game fourth 20 or 21st 20 10 game passed Marcus pagee for 11th on the alltime scoring list were two games into the season but I think the conversation that uh we had with uh coach Hubert Davis about him said what were the things that you challenge him coming into the season what more can he do and sometimes you hear guys talk about well we got to shoot threes hes a big thats got to shoot threes and and not him again thats not his game and I know a lot of people talk about guys playing at the next level do you have to expand your game Davis said look I played in the league played for some great coaches he does what he does best and thats a rebound set screens and be a guy that can do the little things to help you win and Hulk when you look at the bigs in the ACC the five that you see on that list filipowski omir PJ Hall Quinton post who was hurt early last year made a big difference for BC when he was back those are quality bigs to have one of those five is a big advantage in the ACC this year I cant wait to see these matchups I mean you go down the list all of them a little different physical guys you got guys that are matchup issues on the perimeter with their ability to knock down threes there is no shortage of quality bigs in the ACC obviously Armando Bott right at the top of the list with the things that he can do on both end into a Applause for again context important this is Lehi yes picked to finish second in The Patriot League now they dont have the size that the ACC teams have as wh Sydney hits a three but weve seen Armando Bott do this against quality teams too Davis not happy that time with his team giving up a open look Lehi continues to shoot at a high clip from the threepoint line theyre close to almost 40 from Beyond the yard corac Ryan the drive the dish and Seth Trimble back to the free throw Applause line right now North Carolina up 18 but it doesnt feel like it doesnt feel like its its its 18 theyve done a great job credit Le high now looks like North Carolina may win this theyre going to look like theyre going to win this game but I make no mistake about it its a lot closer than it looks in terms of score later today womens college basketball triple header on accn number 17 Louisville hosting to Paul the UNC woman 16th of the country welcome Davidson making the trip from uh just north to Charlotte and then youve got Duke and Team USA in an exhibition contest to cap off the even Whitney Sydney hes done most of his damage in the second half T rejected by Ingram and it belongs to North Carolina thats just great recovery Ingram and I think the key thing in that kept it in play a lot of times guys will punch that out of bounds that time Ingram blocked it gave his chance his team a chance to gain possession which they did went off the leg of Tyler Whitney Music Sydney Ryan Carana breaks the pressure Im not sure that ball hit the floor if you want to teach young players how to break pressure show that last clip ball never touch the ground three passes and then a dunk by corack Ryan you cannot do it any better Whitney Sydney the corner three knocked out of bounds so much of this season is about chemistry for North Caroline official grer of the ACC Armando Bott RJ Davis and UNC theyre bringing the groceries home 80 to 59 less than 4 minutes to go here in regulation at the dean doome and its been a new world order in the ACC these last few years we have seen not just bigname coaches leave we have seen some of the Giants in the history of college basketball step aside Rick patino left Louisville after the 2017 season he was fired and then youve had the retirements of Roy Williams Mike shashy Jim beheim after this past season Tony Bennetts kind of the Elder Statesman now in this league but there is a power vacuum amongst the coaching fraternity when you lose those kind of heavyweights yeah and I I think you know when you think about it too we talked with Huber about this as Lei knocks down another three when he took over again you had Co and then now the added of navigating niil I think you throw that in there I think its remarkable what Hubert Davis has done his first year as you take a look at Carolina with some really good ball movement again not settling for a jumper but youre right theres been a lot of changes in the last 3 years but still quality coaches as you take a look at one of the best to ever do here the Hall of Famer coach Roy Williams and you know look Hubert had a chance to study under him and learn all of the tricks of the tra recruiting to game management uh to obviously dealing with some of the personalities but uh youre right it is definitely a different world right now with transfer portal and nil and become more and more difficult for the these coaches to navigate that so again Hubert knows the significance of him being at the helm of North Music Carolina hes got PA now at Lou and shy at Duke Hubert Davis as you said at his Alma moer Adrien Entre in his first season at Syracuse where theyre playing mantoman defense its things are changing L was the preseason pick to win the league UNC picked third got Miami coming off the final four and really in terms of age if you want to go there its Jim Rona and Leonard Hamilton who are the Elder Statesmen in this league Tony Bennetts the one with the national ttle as Washington draws a foul down low theyre going to call an intentional and again I think end the game 233 game really in hand for North Carolina they dont want anything to get out of control lets take another look see yeah again and I think thats a good call cuz its not a play on the ball he just grabs his shoulder and I think thats the right call again not that malicious or vicious again it wasnt a laack but again you still have to make the play on the ball and Coach Reed right now talking to his guys and and want them to finish strong Jaylen Washingtons an intriguing piece hes one of the four main holdovers from last year Washington and Trimble the Soph mes Davis and Bot the upper classman and Washington this guy was a top 50 player coming out of high school when he came to UNC at the beginning of his freshman year cut short duee to an ACL injury he was rehabbing that he suffered in high school so played in 20 games last year not really a big impact guy again you see that 74 Wings span can he give you minutes and quality minutes in games where an Amando Bott gets into foul trouble well I think these minutes right here huge again uh its important uh for these guys to get game reps and I think the luxury of having a lead right here now look people are going to look after score 8562 but really with about 10 minutes to go in the second have Lei right there uh within single digits in this game uh but youre right uh the minutes that Hubert Daviss bench rotation I think thats the question mark to go along with the threepoint shooting of theyre going to need guys to contribute uh when he goes to his bench and thats another big they plucked from the transfer portal James okono getting in the game originally from England spent the last couple of Seasons at West Virginia hes 68 Music 240 Louisville has emptied a lot of its bench Jason pyo 20 in there Ben Music canosan Zaden High pulls it down theres wji the ground transfer out rebound Ado Tommy coni down low leim Milling Retreat roic gets fouled with 123 left yeah you think of some of these leehigh players now getting into the game Brendan Reed at bin thats the coachs son think of it from a grandparent moment when these guys are old and talking to their grandkids hey I played at the dean doome I got to get into the game sometimes you you lose sight of that in the world that were in this is a big deal for some of these Lehigh Walkins yeah and I think again in any sport again whether its football basketball it does not make a difference as some of the guys whether they walk B are guys that are role players that dont get big minutes or any minutes when you can get them into game in particular in a place like uh the Dean Smith Center uh really its a phenomenal thing things that theyll be talking about for years with their families and their kids Ro hits the free throw and Carolinas brought in the walk on kraton Lebo number 14 Rob Landry number 22 in there as well along with Dewey Ferris a fourth generation tarhill another walk on 34 this is is Reed the coachs son Brendan Reed knocks down the three his dad at Dr Brett Reed and his 17th season as lehis head coach that has got to be happy with that footwork you can always tell a coachs son that was a textbook coming off that screen the crowd wants the walk outs to score Farris had it rejected kicks it to the corner and that three no good by J P and looking ahead for a Lehi as you take a the B for Rob Landry on a Sunday and hes got a smile that stretches from here to Raleigh Jason saigo at the other end just get out of the way have a threepoint shooting contest right now but the Lehi again theyre theyre not going to get the win here but again theres going to be a tough out obviously pick second end of the Patriot League itll stay with youc theyll run out the clock you played when the walk on score why is that such a big deal because they do everything that the starters and guys that get regular minutes do without any uh really promise from the coaches that youre going to get into the game so when you get a chance to get them in there uh both coaches pleased uh with being able to do so Lehi made it interesting for a little while in the second half and then North Carolina blitzed the mountain Hawks and pulled away
