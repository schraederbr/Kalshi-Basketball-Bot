thats going to be a fun match up to one yep Gregory at 12 and a half points a game hes also their leader in assisted for a contest and hes also their steals leader at almost two a game so first meeting in 16 years between neighbors if you will Appalachians made the move down the mountain we got Trey Steins to put the ball in the air hell work with Ted Valentine James breeding here tonight and we get a look at the deacons and the Mountaineers for the first time in 16 years and Appalachian has it first and here is the aforementioned Donovan Gregory going to work for fourth year head coach Dustin Kern earlier on Wake Forest looks like theyre trying to do a lot of switching in their mantoman and this is what Gregory can be really effective because even though hes only six five he can get down in the lane and score as a postup count Terence harkham into the lane with the clock winding down and the Mountaineers on the board first Arkham averages 10 points a game hes been double figures in three of their last four and the deacons have kind of swapped around the lineup tonight Appleby Hildreth Williamson group three guard flavor with the two pigs Carr and Matthew Mark meaning Zach Keller The Freshman will come off the bench tonight for Steve Forbes theres cam Pilgrim left it on the front rim and last Touch by Appalachian it will stay with the Demon Deacons while Hildreth is a player whos really pretty similar to Gregory in terms both of size hes Hildreth is 64 200 pounds in the ability to get down and play inside effective before it sure is and he leads him in rebound because the young man from England here Gregory matched up against Appleby with the defensive oh under the corner Hilder from seven to shoot out front heres car the Delaware transfer a little Spin and shot no good and the foul will be ticketed to CJ Huntley the 611 sophomore from Huntersville North Carolina draws his first thats going to send Andrew Carr to the line Junior transfer from Delaware at 6 11 averaging nine and a half points right at five rebounds hes hes a very skilled player once yep and the first of the two is off the background only his 13th freethrow attempt for the year so he had a double double in the win against Utah Valley s ten and five through the Blue Hens this season I go and it hits the back end of the two shot try to get wake on the pool car has had some problems with fouls this year see the Mountaineer lineup that we spoke up Huntley absent is a young freshman from Pompano Beach theyre very excited about hes averaging six rebounds and got 25 blocks 10 balls will take away and a turnover off Appalachians into the floor heres Williamson okay being a little Fall Away Williamson is a really good player for Wake Forest but hes been bothered by back problems Applause get going on on the offensive end wake suddenly becomes extremely dangerous live for Huntley deflected out there by Carr heres Wake Forest had hilders ahead couldnt find him in transition an Appleton back for Carr thought about it hell take company Baseline into traffic and the scoop got blocked out the lead Thompson got a hand in there he and Huntley both were measured in their approach both teams have started in the mantoman neither one of these teams plays racehorse basketball but each one will take transition opportunities when they can find them Gregory out front long two runs out for Harkins Applause and heres Hilton wakes not shower timid at the offense its not the least heres Williamson deacons on the board with their first field goals thats the kind of thing that Applebee can do everybody talks about him driving the ball to the basket but he can shoot the three he can pull up from the midrange he is a very dangerous offensive player tie up will be there first field goal puts wake in front of him Applause shoot a high percentage if you do that at back in front now Huntley is I mean he can play inside but hes not a back to the basket guy about half his field goal attempts are from threepoint range but when he gets one that close 690 Duncan and its 7 feet marks can dunk it too Matthew Marsh puts it right back in the face of the Mountaineers with his first basket the corner three ball Huntley missed everything Williamson the rebound Deeks in transition heres Carr now Appleby against Harkin tyria three and the rebound pulled away by the Mountaineers hunting we said Appleby could shoot the three but youd rather have him shooting that contest of three thats driving the ball to the basket Place jumped by Hartford yeah one point lead for Wake Forest almost four minutes in Hildreth quickly heres Carr on the win Andrew Carrs got 33 threepoint attempts coming in and the jump list on the front Applause Music Applause CJ Hundley and now heres Gregory on the return I think they just wanted to see what wake was doing defensively Gregory on the scoop and Score first record of the senior from Charlotte Christian hes extremely skilled extremely versatile hes a strong guy he can operate against taller people inside hes done so for most of his career it is a veteran piece to a very transitional roster for Dustin currents heres Williamson trying to answer airball the three Carr comes out its a nice job by Carr he kept moving had that ball hit the rim hes got no chance to get it and regain the lead and two teams have got some interesting wins in their pocket so far in their first respected 10 games but still trying to find what their coaches with term I think a consistent identity theres a fee inside and Jackson is five well get a couple of free throws out of the timeout but weve already had a couple right at the iron a moment ago heres the cut from Huntley for the Mountaineers and at the very next sequence Matthew Morris finishes for the dates Music took Appalachian back to the NCAA tournament and he and Steve Forbes have something in common here as we watch uh Justin Epson go to the free throw theyre both 10 games into this season and heres Forbes in his third year here and they both are still finding out who their basketball team November December thats the time when you put your team together and both of them are trying to do it interestingly West each coach so far has started eight different theres eight different guys who have started the game for these teams so its not like they picked Five Guys and theyve stuck with them theyre trying to move pieces around to find out who can do what in which situations and substitutions for Wake Forest during the break Bobby Clinton is coming in the young man from Sweden at 6 10 he wears 34 in the gold and also for the first time tonight we get a look at Davion Bradford and theres a three from Damian Williamson out of the corner its his 12th of the year and again Williamson is a guy who can really create some offense for Wake Forest hes a good Defender too but hes been hampered by some back issues so thats a good sign for the Deeks it sure is heres Gregory a little follow there over the top of Bradford thats Gregory shot right there he can get to that 15th foot range there in the lane or around the lane or at the freethrow line and get to hit that little Fall Away jump shot hes dead Donald McGregor a pair of field goals Appalachian moving to Hildreth lost the handle on it the roll to the deck and looked like he got locked up with ground it was off the bench but another look at Donald McGregor here unless you mentioned Gregory is a veteran guy and this year he leads the team in just about every category but threepoint shootings he only attempted three threes last year hes already made three this year hes not a threepoint guy but hes the guy who gets the ball close to the basket he can score himself and hes a great facilitator hes got more than twice as many assists as anybody else on the team theres the young and Clinton making a move couldnt finish here to play Beyond Brown in transition into the corner and thats Tyree Boykin back inside theres absent turning with the right hand and score Justin absent on the board he took a long time he was in position he took a part and easy play and made it a hard one but he converted hes got some skill down around the basket four in a row for the Mountaineers theyve tied the ball game at 10 Appleby threw it away heres Gregory with the turnover only hell just to beat in a row to take the lead the other Ranch Appleton finished Bradford does what video you gotta be careful Wes you cant relax if you make a basket with apple be in the game because he gets right down the court and even though thats a tough shot he draws the defense to him and that puts Bradford in great position for that tip 12 Hibachi Walker into the line you see both coaches have no problem getting to the bench early in the ball game brown leaves it inside Epson foul by Applebee on the way up so a couple of free throws for Justin abson whos been apps offense here in the last three sequences well Brown is the guy who you cannot get out on him as a threepoint shooter Upstate more than 44 percent of their shots come from Beyond The Arc but Brown is not one of the threepoint Shooters he is a slasher hes looking to take the ball to the basket and hes penetrated twice now and created easy opportunity he came in only six for ten so hes not a great freethrow shooter but as active as he is down underneath the basket hes gonna need to improve that free throw shooting screw Strokes because hes going to be at the line a lot Lance Taylor or Lucas Taylor rather Softball play Forest North Carolina is checked out absence missed all four free throws so wakes made a lineup change so is Appalachian ball game locked up at 12 Williamson on the attack here is Clinton driving to the left side had a clock cleaned up and heres Brown leading the break for Appalachian and he lost the handle on it but Ted Valentine said it was last Touch by the deacons so we stayed tied at 12 at the under 12 in the Twin Cities tonight on acc Network amazing the six guys have hit 10 or more through 10 games now thats thats really remarkable through 10 games yeah I mean youve got to go a ways to find a school like definitely spent in this game right now dont you I mean everybody talks about three portions and heres Walker going to work at the post and Bradford did a nice job defensively there yeah it really did a nice job moving to Steve Walkers a guy is a pretty good postcut threepointer for the car and thats created by Applebees he gets gets his head and shoulders around this guy hes got that quickness the defense has to come to help but Carr is standing in the right spot thats a great pass too Carhart is talking thats his 10th reporter of the Year puts weight back in front you see this once again somebody stepping out on the sideline but heres the Apple Big Dish Applebee drives and brown has to come and help so he drops off Carr but again he could have thrown that in cars ankles and its not a very good opportunity to for the shot but he throws it right into what coaches refer to as the shooting spots that hes able to catch it and let him go Apple will be trying to save Brown defensively here is Lucas Taylor who averages about 11 minutes a ball game off the first bench first and now eight to shoot applications Give It Away Boykin equipment and beer here appeared to be surprised and receives the ball there but Wesley was four feet from the basket wide open this boy can go into work the back down bustle Up and Under and score him with the right hand Tyree Boykin was an outstanding fact he was a division two AllAmerica Union University in Tennessee scored almost 1700 points then and were finding out the secret in the transfer portal can sometimes be the really good D2 player theres no question about that they just have to adjust to basketball at this level theres a foul on Brown out in the perimeter so his first thatll be the second round the players thats a D2 level are very good players most of the time West theyre just smaller and Boykin at 61 190 pounds to that last movie was another classic post office conference MVP a year ago at 19 and a half points he shot 44 for the floor and nearly 40 for three okay where are you playing heres Carr running another Andrew Carr has become the shooting star for the dates hes got nine of their 18 and he came into the game West only shooting 27 from Beyond The Arc a couple of first half threes from Carr all of a sudden the Mountaineers find themselves in a fourpoint hole breaks the largest lead of this half Brown the Peaks defensively done a really nice job getting out on these threepoint Shooters without giving up the drive to the basketball right around Lucas Taylor he went around Taylor like Taylor was nailed to the floor thats what Bradford can do just as were talking about how the Dukes defense is not a lot a lot of penetration thats about as much penetration as you can get Junior from Sacramento with his first basket stops the Wake Forest run Williams said his shot fake quickly another three by car no back remiss and Trey Steins with a whistle on the Baseline and it is going to be well Taylor just gets caught side and you know you got to prevent that guy from going to the Baseline and Taylor just got caught on his defensive stand with his feet all pro and we said Browns really quick he made him pay for it Second Battle on CJ Huntley by the way a moment ago so hell go to the bench on the third team time against Appalachian that brings uh absent back on the floor Williamson are catching two three pretty straight from Damian Williamson weve seen him do that a lot less during his time at Wake Forest looks like his back might be feeling a little better and thats good news for Wake Forest yep Williamsons got a pair of Threes wakes got their largest lead of this first half its five for the Dukes Music theres Gregory trying to size up foreign Shooters I dont think African beat Wake Forest two at a time and tsuka working inside will draw the brown foul and get a couple of free throws second on ground itll be the fourth on Appalachian so not a lot of fouls for app but impactful ones because its two on a pair of players who have both contributed here in this first half so free throws coming up for John latuka transfer from Marist this one is good dont forget Saturday on acc Network and the ESPN F college basketball doubleheader starts at one oclock well go to the Peterson Events Center North Florida out of the a sun visits Pittsburgh and then at three oclock weve seen that Cornell Syracuse game before doubleheader of basketball on acc networking always streaming for you on the e s PNF leading six for the Deeks and heres Boykin soft jump shot for his second field goals thats a nice job doesnt Force the three to try to force the drive but finds the open in the midrange yep fourpoint game Marsh to his fellow Englishman Hildreth with the right hand broken the rebound to the Miss Appalachian is still without a three tonight average is better than nine a game Applause Applause Appalachian but if it hadnt been Andrew Carr from behind the line tonight its been Davion Williamson Dan well wake is making threes Appalachian is not and thats why weve got a fourpoint lead for the Deep from Kansas State it tooka from Marist Carr from Delaware we expect to see Monsanto from East Tennessee State later in the ball game tomorrow yet speaking of handgun will travel out front he tooka background Miss he took as a guy that has been suffering from some injuries too they really expect him to be a pretty good score and hes just sort of getting back into the swing of things probably going to work against Marsh here mantis comes down to Gregory here is boyfriend trying to work Baseline on him A Little Fall Away with a right hand and Tyree Boykin got the roll did not start tonight for Dustin Kearns his average just seven in his last three games but hes got six here in the first half and after within two hes been a little more disciplined in his shot selection tonight Williamson could not take it by mantis Tuka trying to give a push driving Boykin to the Rock and blocked out of there by Huntley Mountaineers on the move harkham trying to finish on hillgriff and retire all right absom is you know the top 15 and blocked shots in the country and that led to an easy basket Returns the favor all Holly second field goal both of them dumps for Matthew Marsh but what a pass by hildred lots of times when you throw that pass though the big guy is startled to get it youre right good hands by Marsh here is Boykin Applause a little shot fake Fall Away found it away gonna post up he and that fall away is not really a good shot for him Carr heres the Tuka Hawkins tried to draw the charge that pitch wanted it didnt get the call Williamson threeracks on the drive had it stripped out of there Madness with the Wake Forest turned on him Applause man has thought about it Applause deep from the letter F hello fellow standing on the end was Christopher Mattis that is what you call a deep three West collection goes in front on their first three of the night and he shot it from so far it might have been four heres Williamson leaner the rebound Harkins Gregory look at everybody dan look at its like a four out five out on the wing and basket is good for Gregory and Steve Forbes time out half dozen for Gregory appalachians got their largest lead of the first half five in a row by Dustin Kearns and uh Wake Forest giving us some pretty good opening 20 minutes here Dan by hildred as we talked about his ability to get inside and he just makes a nice little dump off pass and credit Marsh who was looking right at it but speaking of looking theres mantis hes standing on the middle bar of the F and I know you want to push out and defend their threepoint shots but whos thinking you got to go out that far yeah you didnt think you had to push out to the parking lot right its very interesting Dustin Kearns happy to see that one go in Boykin all his field goals are two pointers but the app defense weve talked an awful lot about Applebee and the half defense has really kept him under control so far Tyree through traffic heres Carr looking for his third three and a half thats where Appleby has been that is most dangerous not scoring tonight but getting the ball to other people into school a dozen for Andrew Carr Applebee you know he hurt his ankle in practice on Monday well theres theres mantis yep Williamson was right in his face thats the guy who made one and thought okay next chance I get no matter what Im letting it go Mountaineers go right back in front entering 13 with the second of their own here Applebee turned it over on the dribble heres harkham thought about the live and he double dribbled yep sure did Applause meanwhile Christopher Manus is the story so far and thats I mean Williamson is about as close as you can be but mantis he was shooting that one he decided he was shooting it before he ever got anywhere close to the ball and three to the Dome to finish up too making sure everybody was aware threepoint lead for the Mountaineers Appleby able to force a blocking call off the whistle of tech Valentine whats up Tyree Boykin it will be his first that is six on the Mountaineers in his first half Appleby has only scored one field goal tonight less and as we said hes the leading scorer in the ACC coming in yep hes only had three shot attacks Carr lighting up another one now tyrees been bothered by a little bit of an ankle so we dont think hes a hundred percent but still plenty good to play Forest trailing three under three to go even if hes not at 100 hes still pretty good no question Gregory trying to get an advantage on Williamson just the roll and the Fall Away Express I thought he took that a little too far pilgrim my cars been hot from the perimeter just two deacons have hit threes in this first half Williamson and Carr account for their foul 13 to shoot and heres Appleby trying to get on the board from behind the line and cannot Applebees a guy that if you let him go to his right hand he is really going to drive the ball hard on him but when he goes to his left hand lots of times its just a dribble or two two and the pullup its not that he cant do that but thats just not the best part of this game Gregory trying to use a screen from Huntley does and an 18footer is good for Donald McGregor hes got eight on four field goals lead is five for the Mountaineers back to that number again for a second time theyre just swarming Apple car inside up strong and good boy Andrew Carr and hes been solid thats 14 in the first half well he scored in traffic that time he caught that ball in traffic but Appleby is really finding him that was a tough tough pass to make and a harder one to catch the only player in the game in double figures cuts the Appalachian lead down to just three points theres a cup easy dump for Christopher Mass and were going to get a mountaineer timeout from Dustin Kearns wow Mattis Has Come Off the Bench hit two threes and a little back cut for a dunk and a fivepoint lead extended by Food Lion and then at four oclock number five Notre Dame number six Virginia Tech and then well finish with Clemson and top 10 NC State right here on acc network streaming live on the ESPN app wow once again Appleby tries to get into the lane but he is surrounded time to help thats helpful the possession arrow goes to Appalachian State so it will belong to the Mountaineers for 65 seconds to go that had the feeling that Appleby was trying to force things but thats really what he does he forces the pace of the game Gregory Mattis against Williamson foreign Applause Applause Music nice job looking off the defense giving himself a lane for the basket Mountaineers can make it the final possession of the first half they have to choose and I think with the way Gregory can handle the ball that they will choose that you know Gregory West has been getting the ball in the lane close enough but the Mountaineers have been watching him they havent been going to places where he can find him for both of three and a reach in foul with 53 prevented by Hilton uh thats 21st 13th weeks Ive never been a fan of giving files ever but particularly not in the first half so cap state will put it in play and here comes Taylor back for a second time there is Lucas and he will replace Apple Brown comes out and Walker has come back in Gregory to put it in play theres Mattis working against Taylor for three at the horn oh Applause Christopher Mattis in this second half has come in hes hit three threes and a dump and going to the locker room he gets also have to defend the two better plus they got to get Appleby going on offense and for Dustin Kearns I think they got to continue to defend Appleby and do a great job inside the threepoint Arc both things they did very effectively in the first half Madness starts the second half for the Mountaineers out there with absent Huntley harkham and Donald McGregor and cam Hildreth rolling to the basket nice shot by Pilgrim his second field goal the Deacons close it to a four point and I think hilders is the guy who can do some damage on the inside bars with Carr Williamson Appleby and the aforementioned Hildreth on the floor for the dates Mattis nice pass to Gregory the dribble then tried to fire it inside and boy nice play Mars here is Williamson in transition and blocked by Memphis Music CJ Huntley whos now down on the floor oh big sophomore from Huntersville took a spill and then some bad Advantage for the deacons and Damian Williamson Banks home his third three of the ball game and Trey Steins gonna stop playing here and allow CJ Huntley to collect and Regina parte the App State trainer out to check on the big man at 6 11 oh Marsh came down with that rebound and an inadvertent elbow right and the reason Williamson was wide open for that shot is Wake Forest had a five on four and thats thats important for the deacons to take advantage of those situations Williamson he probably hadnt had that much time to shoot a three in the game during his entire career so quickly five in a row and down to a onepoint lead for App State Gregory front harkerman now back to Donovan Gregory with eight to shoot A Little Fall Away nope Gilbert nice job and then its forced and that is absent who could not finish the freebie on the backside Appleby a little cross gets to the basket and slapped off the window by Hopsin and award the basket for Tyree Appleby just his second field goal pass here in the ball game but its enough to put wake in front well this is what Appleby does so well particularly in transition just gets the ball to the goal thats the first time weve seen him get loose for a play like that tonight West 70 run by the deacons to start the second half Forces Unit a hit by one they really have picked up the pressure on the defensive end West I think this matchup Gregory and Hildreth is going to be a key to the game moving forward Gregory tried to bounce it to Huntley and Mountaineers turn it over eight of them now in the ball game for Dustin Kearns teams pilgrim hell take harkham on the drive Williamson against Mattis Music Carr trying to make a move rolling against Hibachi Walker who checked in to replace uh CJ hunt and now mismatching Williamson trying to take the big guy inside and then cannot finish it but what a great rebound by far its wake a second chance Hildreth passes inside good look for marsh and he had it stripped out of there by Gregory he just took away youre a big guy like that you got to get the ball and make a move now five to shoot Appleby trying to find a room man air balls won and Trace diets gonna call a foul and its going to be on absent on the Applebee three itll be the first on Justin abson first of the half and Dustin Kearns is in disbelief well absent is trying to block the shot and the official rule that he got Appleby on the arm a little litigation on behalf of Ty rebound one around a lot of litigation by Tyree so three free throws for Appleby who is 86 percent in the first one good foreign Applause but hes worried about Appleby going by him but youve got to be aware of the shot clock in that situation 20 or more in five games including what he did against LSU and hes got a way to go to get the 20 tonight and then two in the first half hes already got four on this half third one ready and good seven now for Tyree Appleby its a 10nothing run Mountaineers have yet to scratch here in half two we played just about three minutes Applause Walker heres Harkin Gregory trying to deliver to debaji Walker hes got a mismatch against the African in traffic almost lost it against Marsh slips it into Markham the scoop and score for the Mountaineer great job by Walker to maintain that pivot for really good defense by wake that broke down just at the last second twopoint lead for weight Appleby back through traffic fell off the front rim boy thats one he normally makes Gregory slotting in knocked around couldnt finish and look at the whistle in the foul I think theyre ticketing absent with the foul Marsh at the deck our beggar card its just a great job by Walker to maintain his pivot foot avoid the triple team and then as everybody left a nice cut by harkham Brown Music mantis is out and hes a threepoint shooter Brown is in hes not a threepoint shooter he drives the ball of the basket so thats really a change of pace by App State here thank you car takes off Baseline oh at the Finish what a job with all the ball Hildreth time to finish line and draws the foul on Walker well Carr flushes on the Baseline and then Hildreth tried to double down but Andrew Carr the scoring star so far for the Knicks who are up four Music and because hes got a seasonized 16 and were still early in half two hes done a nice job West both on both ends of the court but offensively hes been moving very well without the ball hes made himself available when Applebys been able to penetrate Matthew Marsh with the free throw Pete by the way now is eight of 19 at the freethrow line this season and marshys the guy West hes got to start making some free throws here he puts himself in a situation where when he gets the ball down low Thats all folks are going to do is follow him that one in lead is five 132 Run for the Beats to start this second half they Trail by six and really appalachians twopoint shooting and their overall shooting in the first half was spectacular but its been a bit more of a struggle for Dustin Kearns Mountaineers here in the second 20 minutes well we talked about the fact that the Deeks had to maintain that threepoint defense could pick up the twopoint defense and they have done that very effectively second first on wake Theres the Man from Lone Tree he is very happy with the way that his team has ratcheted up the defensive intensity here at the start of the second half now the question is can they maintain it throughout the second hand yep Gregory and theres Brown I had already told you this is a slasher hes looking to go offensive end of the floor for the Mountaineers and working on Hildreth and fourth cam hilders just stuck Xavion Browns opportunity and tries to finish it the other end bars cant close it Walker off with a rebound now Appalachian trying to find an advantage with Gregors a little crossover and Appleby stripped into the ball over the in line itll stay with that state but two pretty good plays at the iron both ways yeah yeah West but its too I think very poorly executed fast break situations this is a great job by Hildreth just refusing to let Brown get past him and then Gregory here hes the best part of his game West is that little pullup jump shot and he had the opportunity to take one there and elected to take it all the way to the basket and got the shot blocked so two poorly two very poorly executing fast break situation Lefty three Walker too strong back for him Miss and Hilder pulls it away havent seen very many open threes like that for Appalachian State time zabachi Walker by the way its got a 44 rate from behind the line it hit 103s coming into the ball game holder backing down Boykin score largest lead of the night for Wake Forest at seven the difference in Hildreth from a year ago Dan very noticeable well hes much more aggressive Wes Applause and confident too I think that has a lot to do with it sure does Applause Boykin over the top of marsh now the rebound recovered by the Dukes Wesson when youre 61 trying to shoot over 71 thats thats not an easy pass car inside down with brown and Andrew Carr has got 18 now on his seventh field goal and a timeout taken by Appalachian State Dustin Kearns I think was looking for a charge at the weekend of the floor and maybe another whistle along the way this team Trails nine and theres Aaron whos a semester behind they are twins hes a semester behind Andrew and both as you said great young people and uh fun night for the Muse family at least until the ball went here nice strong move by Greg with Ill tell you what hes got a double figure Knight on his fifth field move and hes been struggling a little bit scoring the ball the last couple of games but hes got the Mountaineers to within seven its been a hard second half for Kearns group to travel out on the perimeter by Carr and a turnover by the Deacon thats that really frustrates a coach right there you have a little bit of a cushion and you just give the ball away I mean you werent trying to make a play it wasnt capacity where if you completed it it goes to the basket its just it you move your pivot foot and so now you give the ball back to App State six turnovers tonight for the deacons and six turnovers is not a bad total at this point in the game was yeah they were minus eight in that margin on Saturday at the loss in Atlanta to LSU Matt is back on the floor catching shoot three and fouled by Williamson so Williamsons first second of the Deeks and heres three free throws coming for Christopher Mattis and thats a situation where Bradford just has to jump out on him because he had missed tonight Williamson trying to come over just hits him on the elbow mantis seven of eight at the line hes got a dozen now in the ball Wesson he has shown you said catch a truth thats what he does he catches it its gone you just cannot give him that kind of look Applause Music who said wait a second that guy played only five minutes a game last season averaged two points in one rebound and hes got 13 tonight he had 25 against Charlotte for West in that Charlotte game they lost the game theyre up by 22 and ended up losing by nine but Mattis came off the 360 first half and made seven straight threepoint baskets yeah so guess whats happened tonight theres a kick and that was off the foot of that and all of a sudden its a fourpoint game here comes the Swedish freshman Clinton for the deacons after the turtle again a little bit of frustration for Steve Forbes you have a turnover where you drag your pivot foot and then you just dribble the ball off your foot as you got to tighten it up on the defensive end thats what got you going in the second half anyway yep we have not seen Huntley back on the floor since he was shaken up earlier thats a nice job applicants Gregory for pointing out of the corner first three gets him nine its an eightnothing run and the Mountaineers do it to the point one point game Dinkins with the lead theyll have the rock but Tyree Boykin buries a triple as we go to a break Cindys for gentleman Carl tasty and he too was from Dobbins Bennett High School in Kingsport Tennessee when skip Brown wasnt the first one and he wasnt the only one but Wes he was the guy who personified a shift during an era when he played with two forwards two guards and a center and either one of your guards could handle the ball well skip Brown was the guy who handled the ball 99 of the time for the deacons he was a true point guard when there was no such term right well the term wasnt in common usage lets put it that way yeah heres Hildreth he is a combo guard with Appleby and Williamson and cam Hildreth got his fourth field goal of the night and Wade pushes it back to three and like Gregory Hildreth is doing his best work within a few feet of the basket Applebee the poke and the score how about that boy what a sequence about Appleby Dan we talked about it at the top its not just the number in the points category for this guy and hes a he supplies so much energy and here he goes almost got it from Boykin one more time Skip and heres parkum three and Hilder the rebound thats a really nice defensive adjustment by Wake Forest the guy they didnt guard out of the threepoint line was Gregory and thats thats great because hes not a threepoint shooter car now hes working on a season High tonight for Coach Forbes this club and almost nine minutes in Hildreth trying to extend the Wake lead Williamson looking for the big number cant finish the three Clinton almost took it from Hartman and he couldnt handle it and now heres Gregory lost the handle on it and turned over by Appalachian note James breeding gonna step in help try Steins here I believe and it will stay with the Mountaineers this is a situation where I think that Hildreth hit the ball as he was trying to make the spin move I dont think he was spinning to go all the way to the basket with I mean I think he was trying to spin around for that short jump shot nice defensive play by hildren Boykin out of the ball game Gregory Over the Top of car is he rebound on the backside for Wilton fivepoint lead for Wake Forest the timeout Applause Forbes team trying to find another bit of momentum and theres Williamson through traffic blocked out of there by Nance way too many for David questions Harkin the sophomore from Butner North Carolina now for Gregory Markham off the dribble score thats a heck of the play by Harkins came off the bench the last two he said three double figures in the last four games and hes got eight tonight Mountaineers to within three that Hildreth back to work Applause foreign Applause Music Applause Music Applause has been doing that very effectively in the second half I thought Clinton did a made a mistake bringing his Defender to that play but Hildreth was able to score anyway fivepoint game for Wake Forest and how many backgrounds tonight have we seen back guards mantis another three and trying to make the save was absent going into the Mountaineer bench and James breeding says last Touch by Upstate Applause Music here well hes hes got to make a night hes got to make a tough move to get around the car and then hildridge just backs in backs in backs in and despite the fact that Clinton comes into the lane with a 610 guy Hildreth is able to still make the play so its a fivepoint game its better than nine minutes to go Music car quick look at Marsh and hell put it on the deck recovered a distance and there is Huntley moves back to the ball game after being shaken up early second half foreign Music Applause Music Applause Music state Music blocked away on the drive by Appleby that was Huntley here is Gregory leading the way hell feed Huntley Marsh got it up on the rim and theyre going to score the basket for CJ mutton its a funny looking play right there with walking through this dance this is a tough play right here the ball and it hits the backboard and I think thats why its called the goaltan James breeding is stopping play here for a moment Music Applause Music that was a close play right there because I originally thought watching it live the car hit the ball from underneath while I was going up in the air but it looked like he missed it and didnt get it till it hit the rim so if the ball hits the glass and then he hits if the ball hits the rim hits the cloud hits the backboard you cant you cant touch it Applause thank you Applause part of the world against Walker man is trying to help Builders left alone nice dribble step side and the three was not collected in the corner by Carvel t7 hes checked into the ball game timeout one point game under eight to go they had played in 16 years you didnt think anybody was walking off tonight did you back to Winston after this we love our new home theres so much space see womens hoops right here on accn and always streaming for you on the ESPN app Music still play basketball wolf actually Coppin State Kevin keetson Juan Dixon went to work the other night and so I mean Ill tell you now Keith might be watching tonight coach I will tell you Dan and I like the Retro Jerseys drive and offensive foul on Mildred as the clock was shot clock was expiring tset the young man from Baton Rouge whos a transfer from Northwestern State stepped right in Dan but its really a nice job of coming out to help defensively because hilders went right by mantis and thats the situation where Hildreth needs to pull it up but youre right West he was in a hurry because the shot clock was running down mantis tried to fire to Huntley on a pick and roll and Appleby just traveled well theyre calling the foul they are calling the foul Ted Valentine Apple became Music Applebees causes such a but hes able to get into the lane mantis knows that hes trying to stay in front of him and he just cant personal imagine Sports on Appalachian and theres another foul and thats on Gregory for the push Donald mcgregorys second were trying to lob it to hildren thats a clever play Applause Music fifth on Appalachian Music three on Wake Forest as we play here in half two Marsh had it poked Away by Hunter I mean they dont play very often I mean they havent played in 16 years the last meeting was late November 2006 Wake Forest has won all 20 meetings with Appalachian and I think tea set just got called football sure did so car key said draws his first hes a transfer from Northwestern State a very decorated High School career same high school as Reese Speakman of Virginia Scotland bill down in Louisiana and now Appleby had it knocked away in last Touch by Keith this is so far one of the weirdest possessions Ive seen all year in any game yeah okay just clarifying I was giving us there just the ones youve done fouls Music three fouls for the Mountaineers alone on this possession to give him six as a squad heres car now working on Walker that is an offensive foul on car so the fourth foul at this end of the four is the first underway cost nice job Walker Dan yeah but what carb does Wes is he turns his shoulder if he keeps backing in hes okay as long as he doesnt turn if you turn your body so youre perpendicular and you go to your Defender and you go right into his chest with the shoulder that is automatic for the officials really nice job by Walker moving his feet the list there were four fouls on that position unbelievable and the ball went out of bounds and there was no shots wheres Walker and now Gregory with 12 to shoot back for dabagi Walker around Marsh in traffic nice Up and Under and the Mountaineer are in front on the first basket of the night for the grand transfer from UMass he took that ball I thought into trouble West but he was able to convert thats a great play six nothing run by at state Appleby trying to put the dates back in front and does with a foot on the line for two 11 for Tyree Appleby the nine of those coming in the second half we said at halftime West that he had to come alive a little bit offensively and he certainly has in the corner heres a three and an air ball off the hand of tea set were covered inside shot clock did not reset they really want to get it to Madison here he is fall away two got Christopher Madness first field goal to the second half hes got 16 now theyre just changing leads at each end of the floor 82 run by the Mountaineers back after this the JMA Wireless Dome thats hard to thats hard to get your head around saying all right just move along to the next one one point lead for Appalachian and now Appleby who had a two little crossover trying to get into March deflected by hunting and heres Gregory into Mountaineers and heres Walker again on the drive too strong the followers on the front ramp slapped out heres Williamson Damian all the way good finish Clinton cleans it up everybody go a little too fast by the way shot clock didnt we said white ball didnt hit the rim on the Williams and drive Appleby looking for Carr theres Tyree forced it and the rebound from Mattis that probably slipped down Mountaineers with an advantage heres Mattis inside Huntley lost it and a foul took a trip falling all the way forward Ted Valentine out from underneath he gets on Matthew Marks bent it over a lot of activity not a lot of results the big guy looks like hes worn out first on Marsh fifth All the Way Forest Marsh tries to come into the play and he didnt mean to but thats just a tired foul right there Marsh is out so late now going with a small amount Hildreth Williamson Appleby Carr and Bobby Clinton 610 freshman from sweet mantis against Carr on the drive Christopher Mathis has got seven in the second half and 18 in the ball game Aaron hes more than a threepoint shooter obviously West Appleby for the top rebounded Clinton Williamson attacks on the win the ball dont disagree with me there 10 to shoot Builder though good option to have in your pocket Applause as the shot clock goes off thats a great defensive play Gregory all the way to the basket and knocked out of bounds last touch of the Deeks kabaji Walker came from nearly the top of the key to come down and help out harkham because Hildreth was setting him up for another one of those back down plays hell just dropped the ball off but it was a very tough shot inside four to go people Mountaineers a threepoint advantage and the veteran Gregory handling tried to go to mass and thatll get us to a break nine to shoot for every state when they come back Mountaineers and another tight fit in the ACC back after this Music kearnss team a onepoint victory its a threepoint Advantage under four to go they only got seven to shoot man is picked up on the dribble heres Gregory with three on the clock and a backroom Miss thats rebounded by call good job getting out on mantis on the drive Appleby rebounded car Williamson shoots the time hits what happened between he divorces the defense to react and therefore youve got some offensive rebounding available and that creates a wide open three six in each half for Damian Williamson hes got four threes tonight for his dozen tied at 59 coming up on three to play Gregory skip for Walker and Huntley couldnt squeeze the orange and then commits a foul after he lost his balance CJ huntleys third but its team foul number seven now so thatll send Appleby to the line so coming to the other end is Tyree Appleton trying to make a foul on hooked that will be three for three at the line hes got a oneonone opportunity coming in at 86 percent I might have in him at the line trying to put the deacons in front and good on the front end one point lead dont forget ACC PM Mark Packer Trey Boston Tyler Tannenbaum talk football the latest from around the conference weekdays at four on acc Network and always streaming on the ESPN app Applause he does not have any assists foreign lead for the deacons trying to win their 11th straight here at Joel Coliseum Gregory backs down Hildreth with the right hand rebounded by the sophomore and that was a close shot for us but it was not an easy shot and you got to credit the defensive Gilbert he did a great job moving his feet and just stand between Gregory and the basket 12 minutes since Andrew Carr scrapsed in this ball game Williamson looking for another three Platinum cant finish up the dump on a Ted Valentine whistle will keep it at the Wake into the floor its on to bhaji Walker and a twoshot opportunity one of the things that Lake Forest has done very well was particularly here in the second half is get on the offensive boards theres the young man from Sunrise Christian Academy in Kansas but grew up in the south of Sweden Bobby Clinton played on the Swedish under 20 national team they really think hes got a great future the versatility has shown is Way Beyond just shooting 70 run by the dates four point lead this is almost a must score for Parker Walker clutches on a three cant get by car now well spin him into traffic and score tough shot Ozzie Walkers got a pair of field goals here in the final few minutes marches out of the game so you have the opportunity if youre out of state to drive the ball with the basket Applause Appleby uses the Clinton screen now finds the freshman back for Carr blocked recovered by Huntley terrific play by Walker heres Walker thought about the three skips out Harkins Shoots for the lead backside follow Huntley Tom thoughts a timeout with 80 Seconds to go in the ball game Dan for West here in the second half one team has run out and then the other team has changed it has been a very interesting interesting ball game well an apple I taught it at the hit the offensive glass and Walker has been a factor here that missed by heartcoming got a wide open three but they were so conscious of defending the three and walking through so much pressure there when anybody in the side of the basket to block out job just being in the right place at the right time all right lets go with Steve forbess huddle here okay is it one of the three guards you got you got the ball in their hand they got 25 to shoot 120 to go but I think what you have is the guy who has made plays and created things for you all years after so I think thats your first option but Hildreth has done such a great job getting the ball down low if he can get it down there and draw the defense weve seen him home score but be able to kick it out to Williamson so yes I think its one of the three guards in this situation Appleby Williamson or Hilda who youre looking for this basketball well each schools got one timeout as the deacons put it in play no change Personnel wise for either school during the timeout Appleby race to the rack and scores against Gregory its just the Wake Forest offense they set up and everybody moved to once the other side of the court and allowed Applebee to get going Tyree Applebys got 15 cleared out the right side Applebys the strongest for his right hand and theres a good defensive play by Hilton great play by Hildreth and now the deacons can afford to burn it a little bit here yeah but they still dont have enough time to run out the clock and so if youre out of state you can afford to play good defense without foul another drive by Appleby missed the layup heres Gregory and Appalachian Baseline harkham finds Huntley through traffic put it up got it blocked gets it back harkel back for Huntley they skip heres Gregory 12 to shoot Manus is out front heres parkum for the lead got him and Applebees down looks like Appleby hurt his ankle Applause Terence harkham has put Appalachian in front on his first three of the night Tyree Appleby Hood been nursing a bit of an ankle issue coming into the ball game is down and Mark armor the Wake Forest basketball trainer now in his second year out to have a look at the Deacon going west that was the situation where it was great Patience by App State on the offensive end they moved the ball from side to side they forced the Wake Forest defense to Chase and based on the way Harkin has shot the ball tonight I dont know that thats a bad shot for Wake Forest to give up but theyre chasing the ball and again that comes out of Walkers hands Walkers been a factor down the stretch and debaji Walker who started his bird Cleveland State with Tyree Appleby in fact were finding out tonight they were roommates in the Vikings program and this has happened to well in the hard news here is is that something like this and Steve Forbes not just tonight hes at Rutgers on Saturday and Dan next Tuesday night dukesy well youre right Wes this is theyre sort of up against it you just hope Applebys okay yep you know they said he was having a little bit of an ankle problem and Applause just hope thats nothing more serious so Applebys having to go to the Wake Forest locker room through the tunnel here at Joel Coliseum meanwhile Steve Forbes got to huddle his unit and this is whats ahead for Wake I mean its theyre no gimming now well Wes I mean Virginia Tech is having a fabulous season and that game see the way they start in League Play Duke Virginia Tech Carolina my goodness so now Wake Forest is out of timeouts theyve got to go the length of the floor with 147 left and they cant this is a situation West where youre down one so you cant afford to take the last shot right youve got to go up and get the first good shot but you can Williamson and Hildreth seem to be the most opportune guys for forums heres hilbrith at the Timeline with 10 hell take it on the drive and fished around and they go to the deck here Marsh had it and now Walkers got it with 23 left and a hell ball is called but possession belongs to the Mountaineers West that was a situation where Hildreth was going to the basket he was trying to get it up obviously youd like it to go but they thought they were going to crash the boards a great job blocking out by Upstate and now unless you steal the ball you got to follow immediately because Dustin currents throw at the length of the floor here Dan try to or just get it in I think you just get it in in this particular case Wes you know you throw it to length of the floor you always risk throwing it out of bounds on the other end with nobody touching you saw that in Louisville earlier then what happens is it comes right back down underneath the basket yep now if you can throw at the length of the floor and have one of your guys catch it then thats a different story both schools are out of timeouts with 23 left to go as current burns his last one Music all youre worried about getting here West is getting the ball in back well and by the way masses came on the floor during the dead ball for Appalachian so theyre clearly trying to get at least five good freethrow Shooters out there well and thats the other thing that youve got to have guys out and out there who can make free throws right and wake will certainly be trying to not only defend the inbounds pass but if its caught by the Mountaineers get a foul put them on the line right yeah youre not particularly worried if youre Wake Forest if you commit a foul before the ball goes in bounds as long as you dont get called for a flagrant fight because the deacons have got one on the house to burn Dan theyve only got five team fouls that makes it even more difficult it sure does but you got to be careful if you follow a guy off the ball West uh thats a point of emphasis this year they want to get called for a flagrant foul first thing youre trying to do is steal the ball so Carr defends the inbounds pass theres a spot throw in for Gregory cant move and he tried to get it to harkham touched his hand and goes out of bounds to Wake Forest now again wish they dont have any timeouts right 13 left and now James breeding and Ted Valentine want to look at the clock here they want to look at the clock absolutely theyre looking to see who touched the ball last harkham was litigating that maybe a deacon got a hand in there but thank you well Wes the point here is that the clock starts when the ball is touched in bounds and so if the first touch was by the App State player harkham Im not sure how his whole second could have kicked off the clock well 23 if March touched the ball first then thats when the fox gets stuck so lets have another look here Music and Trey Steins are at the monitor across the way and Steve forums huddles with the defense and Wes lets look at this again and watch when the clock starts it starts on the parking touch and it should stop when the ball is out of bounds and the balls about out of bounds until he touches something out of that okay so thats what the officials are looking at it did not appear there that the clock started on a on a on a on a potential car touch all right so the shot clock operator didnt change the car touched it foreign so its very possible that the ball was touched by Harkin and one second went off the clock before the ball touched out of bounds so Jan that bridge says yep thats the word thats what were doing so theyre going to hold with 13 wake will have a sideline inbounds play here on the near side as we look at it and debaji Walker will defend that pass man not West let me tell you something was 13 seconds left you have the chance to catch the ball dribble it and shoot it what you dont want to do if your Wake Forest is catch the ball with your back to the basket if youd like to catch the ball going toward the goal if you can absolutely freshman is defending the rim Walker will defend the inbounds pass at 6 11 here is Carr attacks soon foreign Music well Steve Forbes had the Whiteboard out in the Hummer and he had a lot of time with the review to draw it up and the guy who owned the first half for the dinks closes the show tonight in Winston well theyre still looking over there to see if the ball was out of his hand I think it was Music right the clock doesnt start until the ball is caught balls caught starts clearly out of his hand there you go first points in the last 14 minutes for Andrew Carr and youve got a flare for the dramatic boy that is a heck of a play to get him open for that and then he just does a nice job being patient he wasnt in any hurry at all and the big question for the Geeks West this is a great winform but what happened to Todd what happened to Thai Appleton yep deacons are headed to Rutgers on Saturday before beginning a resuming ACC play against Duke here next Tuesday night boy what a night for Andrew Carr he finishes with 20 four deacons and double figures and a heartbreaking loss Rapala today Appalachian they everything they lose is a close game yep well Steve Forbes his team wins their 11th straight at Joel Coliseum theyre seven and four headed to Rutgers on Saturday night had a uh boy what a tough night for Appalachian who by the way is uh eventually headed to the desert next week to play in the Colangelo classic but uh boy great to be with Dan Bonner tonight the 21st win in the series for Wake Forest they won all 21 of them but boy tonight my guess
