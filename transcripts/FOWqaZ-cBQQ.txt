up in the 90s tonight if they can get it So we are set to go Louisville at number 24 in the country NC State trying to get into that top 25 They are as hot as a firecracker NC State has the ball for the first possession in red tonight And theres Copeland whos been an assist machine McNeel Jr backs away and off the back iron cant hit the first shot A lot of what NC State talked about today in practice is the sides of the guards for Louisville 61 62 and the comparison of length to NC State shooting over the top of the smaller guards Thats going to be knocked down deep into the corner A threepointer by Isaac McNeely Thats his game He makes 40 as we give a look at the NC State starting lineup Darren Williams a key man of course 15 and five per game Trey Holland is going to be really important defensively tonight Yeah hes had his best two ACC games in the last two prior and youre going to see him on the ball Will described him as a pit bull on the basketball to transfer from Michigan State Just that basketball IQ and pressure is what you need to get up underneath Mikel Brown Jr and the head coach Patty there Hes up one So Conwell to put it in here for the Cardinals Theyre 17 and six Theyve won five of their last six games 74 in the ACC NC State at 186 92 in the conference And heres Mike Brown a 65 freshman who can be hot and cold When hes hot hes incredibly exciting Hes been chilly lately shooting it NC States game plan is they switch everything Positions one through five Hadley wriggling free inside the 67 sixth year man for the bucket to make it five to nothing cheering This is a building that can get as loud as any place in the country on a given night Williams will let fly Hes 42 from threepoint land Conwell will attack and its tipped out of play and theyll keep it on this end If you look here at the bottom left look at F come up and he seals Darren Williams right there seals him up and acts as a screener which allows Harley to get to the rim Those are the types of heads up plays that your bigs need to make in order to create driving space Brown averaging 15 points a game Drives has that quick step and lays it in So dynamic off of dribble That little hesitation considering hes such an elite shooter Throws the defender off and then what a great lay with the left hand Excellent start here for the Cardinals on their home courts cheering leading at 7 nothing The swing pass by Copeland Thats going to be out of play and theyre going to turn it over So a couple of quick turnovers here for Will Wade Not only is he brand new to NC State he brought nine transfers to Raleigh six of whom played in the NCAA tournament last year And if you remember his preseason wish was to be right there contending for top four in the ACC And this sixgame winning streak has them right there in that position Although he doesnt want to talk about it Yes he just wants the double by Thats all he cares about is a double buy in the ACC tournament Turnover Williams There you go Thats how you attack him cheering Good stay at home defense there by Mike El Brown on the cut Copeland leaning inside and lays in two And finally NC State on the board NC State really good at attacking the paint using that size and physicality One dribble down Hadley and hell draw the foul in the paint Foul on number two McNeel Thats his first team And the foul will go on McNeel as he picks up number one Javon Hadley Thats goending Thats goending The ball hit the backboard first Was just about to talk about how good the officiating has been in the ACC this year Roger Ays Ryan Groover AJ Desai Excellent crew here tonight Well they missed one I mean it happens We all miss one And this is a grade A officiating crew though Everybody misses one Yeah its allowed Its athletic competition screaming Its not really allowed but you know laughter depends when its allowed Yes Last two minutes we dont want to be talking about Its 7 to2 Louisville What a pass on the cut and a dunk there by Ben Alubin So NC State bouncing back after seven nothing deficit Ben Alen Lubin eight straight games with 10 or more points Hes been a factor in this win streak for the Pack McDe with a long one Got it He has six quick ones Talking about one of the most lethal shooters not only in the ACC but in the country Have to have better awareness on where McNeely is on the court at all times Copeland who just picked up an ACC player of the week A spectacular week for the 66 senior Good slip at first slip inside and the 611 junior out of brew will lay it in by Louisville looks very sharp offensively Well Fruit came out for that screen and just slipped it The defender stay high and it led to an easy dump cheering McNeel feeding in the corner Long one there by Williams Wont fall He has a couple early misses Conwell wants the paint Slams on the brakes Brew will dunk it Now the Cardinals at home in rhythm cheering and applause Theyve got the crowd here at KFC center behind them right away cheering Copeland finding Williams 66 senior cheering So much on his shoulders this year preseason ACC player of the year Will drive it Went for the bank and came up empty He hits cheering the deck Loose ball Theyve got a threeon one Fouronone now They run the break and a foul applause above them in the ACC rankings So they havent beaten Miami North Carolina NC State UVA Clemson They got swept by zero So playing in a game like this sets their tone getting their best player back in Mikuel Brown Jr and the rhythm that theyre going to find with their perimeter but also with the intensity on the defensive end Javon Hadley at the line Copeland fouled him right before the timeout and theyre going to keep it right here as its tipped out by NC State So right now everything breaking Louisvilles way in the early minutes Louisville number three in the country in threepoint attempts per game 334 per game number five in makes a little bit over 11 per game So they live and die with it and have got 10 to get up a shot on this possession Roots getting inside Cant lay it in So the Wolfpack try to cut into it Talented freshman out of Baltimore Matt Able with it Miss an opportunity for a post up with that Albert down low Williams gives it up Guadire Copeland Look at that handle Hell drive it Stuffed by Ali Khalifa And a foul called on the play with 1505 to go in the first half He didnt think so with the sevenfooter from Egypt They missed giving the ball down low to the big had that match up on him and then the drive cheering Thats a tough one Copeland knocks down the first Hes 77 If it comes down to a foul shooting contest these are two of the very best in the conference cheering NC State makes 76 And Copeland leads this NC State team in free throws made with 98 The next most made on the team is 64 If it goes to show you how aggressively he uses his size his frame and physicality to get to the free throw line Well Wade brings on Terrence Arsenal 66 junior out of Oman Texas Hes probably only going to play eight guys tonight Louisville by comparison might go 11 deep in this game Great job by Van Allen moving to apply pressure Khalifa is so good at passing the ball to the top of the key Kalipo over the top gets it downstairs to Hadley and his pass is picked off Able stepping right into the lane So NC State picking it up here the last couple of minutes going up against Khalifa Thats a very tough angle and hell commit the foul on Ben Allen Luben former North Carolina Tarheel and Khalifa picks up number one the Egyptian magician because of his passing ability Hes outstanding with it Hes one of the best passers in college basketball You know you have to give a lot of credit to Van Allen Luben being undersized at 69 does a really good job of carving out space and finding a way to get to the free throw line Fifth nationally in field goal percentage a lot of his play inside out as a passer and defender He holds his own down low on the block You mentioned formerly in North Carolina You can bet he watched Duke and Carolina on Saturday What a finish You were there You saw the court storming as well Caught you by surprise Yeah Well the the the court storming I feel isnt the issue False security is and if people on the floor and Yellow Jackets dont have the authority or training thats a system failure not a fan problem Frank Well they run a great play and an easy basket by Conwell underneath Typically hes beyond the threepoint line but that time gets inside You know just to finish that point Obie most of the time these are third party event staff people and were asking seat ushers to manage chaos and frankly that should not be the case I say keep the kids off the court I know theres exuberance there at the college level but someone always seems to get hurt and there were injuries There were players and personnel who got knocked around Big drive there by Conwell Tipped off the iron It wont fall in transition Hollow off for Williams Boy he got a great look Hes had a few early on and he hasnt cashed in Williams the 66 senior Khalifa loves to give it up Brown swishes it in from threepoint land Once again if there is no pressure being applied to Khalifa and youre not deterring his vision cheering that is an assist waiting to happen Hes not the first Ali whos drawn plenty of cheers in this town but he can really dish it Hollerman in the paint will lay in two 13 minutes to go and in the first half Louisville making it tough on the Wolfpack to get consistent rhythm in their offense Brown looking to hand off in a loose ball picked off by Arsenal HOLLERMAN BANKS IT IN Holl for three Threepointer off the glass Not even a hint of a grin He has five Conwell Oh hes hit on the elbow Shooting a three Hell be headed to the foul line Thats his first And just the pass here Yeah Matt Ael really not keeping contact towards a shooter playing a little bit up on that And Khalifa is such a good passer passer Sees that spacing delivers a dime right in the pocket for Muel Brown Jr to knock down a three in the corner So three shots here for Conwell Excellent The line 83 Had 24 against Duke earlier this season Had 24 against Kentucky 25 against Cincinnati You think between him McNeely and MueL Brown Jr I said it earlier I thought they had one of the best back courts in the country and a guy like Cwell that just 117 points per game over his last three in a little bit of a shooting slump But this is a team that when they start to make shots from the outside and they bring that defensive tenacity OB they can beat anybody in the country Conwell with another one coming and then he drops in all of them He has five points 2312 the build and Conwell to take a seat NC State a very good shooting team In fact probably the best shooting team in the conference when you consider threepoint accuracy and overall nice dish downstairs Luben will stuff it home and five points for Van Allen Luben NC States top man on the glass too Seven rebounds a game Woolly to the baseline Got himself shot underneath but they really buckled down on him Yes NC State off the window on the strong drive there by Hollowman So they cut it down to 2316 Swatted away by Van Allen Lubman but a foul before that Goes to show you how he values the ball and also that limits the team from getting out in transition Hes showing you just in his vision the tempo in which he plays why hes so critical to the Wolfpack team We were talking to Will Wade extensively about him during their practice today Ven Allen Lumin getting a step that cant hit from close range He said I didnt necessarily see it coming at this level He said Obviously I knew hes a good player outstanding player because he had him at McNe State before coming here but he said this is a whole different level that Copelands playing at right now Louisville one and done Copeland will drive it scoop it and bank it in So that was on Q He has six And for more lets go to Molly Timeout The first message in NC States huddle was as soon as the shots start falling well be right back in this game So thats got to give him confidence And head coach Will Wade also really frustrated with his team cheering defensively telling them stay in front of the ball You need to pressure the ball Youre letting them run up and down the court You got to put pressure on them Make every touch difficult Guys to your point Molly right there Matt Able able to get a deflection that leads to a fast break jam by Copelan Brown steps back A nice save McNilly comes away with it but the hustle was by Rogers on the sideline to keep it in play Out of the double Hi to drive it Hes been playing a little nicked up and he cant hit close in Luben grabbing a rebound and heres Copeland Hes starting to get going with a couple of terrific passes That would not be one of them He fires that one Thats her third turnover Well Matt Ael doing a really good job getting that outside hand deflection on the ball Thats being down in the great defensive position and then making the pass to Copeland for the strong finish in transition Those are the type of plays that Will Wade wants to see from his team defensively switching positions one through five having active hands and getting a ton of deflections Now for the a tough stretch beginning really tonight for both Louisville and NC State inside the ACC The Cardinals still to face North Carolina and Clemson on the road McNeely with a miss on a layup NC State running McNeely off the threepoint line making him a driver Arseno kind of tumbling into the paint Theyre fortunate to retain it Good pass The jumper will not drop out of the corner by Arsenal on the run McNeely off the fake Cant hit the three Didnt attempt it Conwell will A nice job finding a guy whos a little more open A great job by McNeely using a head fake and then letting the defense transition below the basket Nobody recovering to the threepoint shooter Cardinals by eight Copeland McNeely on him off a couple of spins leaning in seeking out some contact Boy he was in and out of the cylinder Brown Jr to push the tempo Goes up strong and draws the foul Tell you what when Duke blew out Louisville they were incredibly physical with Michael Brown They pushed him all over the court and it really paid dividends in a huge win for Duke Now music the upcoming schedule for coach Kelsey and his team We mentioned those games coming up at North Carolina at Clemson Theres also one at Miami This is a gauntlet schedule This is the opportunity for Louisville though You only get better by playing against the best And obviously going against a guy like Boopy Miller allows you to do that defensively with the way SMU has been playing North Carolina just with a massive win over Duke Derek Dixon Seth Trimble Hes going to play against guards that are bigger stronger guards that can knock him off his position And thats where your conditioning and your IQ come into play Theres no doubt about it Nobody questions the talent level of Mike Brown Jr Its about settling into the pace and the temple of the game and making the right reads 80 at the line for the freshman from Orlando And Oval back on top by 10 He has seven points Under nine minutes to go in the half cheering Fable never got there Picked off at Louisville trying to turn that into points Hadley down the lane Will lay it in That just opened up for him cheering Siobhan Hadley the sixth year man out of Minneapolis This is his seven nothing run now for Louisville Williams whos been really quiet pounding it downstairs and drops in two Williams there is nobody stopping that freight train on the court His first basket Brown with a great touch Buries the three 10 points for him in the first half cheering Sa handing off for Williams Williams lets fly Got it Talking to Will Wade today before the game he said he does not want this game to be attracting Pace is going to be very important for NC State Brown again Yes sir Hes had a big half with 13 applause Three for four from threepoint land for Mike cheering Williams will step back and fire Hes feeling it Knocks down another one and hes going back and forth with some fans here in the front row Little bit of conversation I dont think he minds it Him and Cardier Copman are two guys that dont mind a little trash talking if anything And gets them more engaged in the game Brown gives up the dribble Heres Conwell Brian Conwell averaging 18 Zuberus on the low block Shot clock down to two Brown fires again Rebounded away by the Wolfpack And Williams has the last eight points for NC State Those arent the shots that we want for NC State Get a quality possession We just talked about tempo and pace That pace plays right into the way Louisville wants it to be And he got an absolutely hot hand in Williams They ignored him there Conwell cant hit it Oh Zubus goes down hard on his back with a big time thud 6A junior Really really interesting kid Yeah I just extremely smart and great vision Can make reads and frankly I think hes a guards dream to play off of Hes starting to knock down the threepoint shot more but also he finds the gaps and he finds the players who make the shots Conwell traveling with it Six minutes to go first half Theyve kicked it over five times And just speaking of Muhammad Ali you talk about a guy who owned his name his voice and his convictions when it cost him everything He proved that his legacy is built by controlling narrative not just winning titles Truly incredible You connected to Howard Coell forever You get a chance to go back and I know its a long way back but watch some of those interviews between those two some amazing journalism done by Howard Kosell but what comes out of you know the that sense of justice from Muhammad Ali as you mentioned amazing And neither was afraid to challenge each other in their positions And I think that was such a respectful thing that you dont see typically in todays news cycle No you dont see those type of relationships anymore You sure dont 10point lead Brown gives it up Andrew Woolly into the fray now for the Cardinals trying to pick up their 18th win of the year Khalifa shot clock is down to 10 Conwell not afraid to let it fly from beyond that threepoint land Going to drive it Couldnt get one off Brown off the fake Lips and buries another one Hes had a half 16 for the freshman Talked a lot about Brown Jr cheering and shot selection and picking his spots on the floor Just extremely patient and getting the right shot off at the right time Big fight for the rebound Still loose About six guys hitting the deck Brown comes away with it Good hockey assist Woolly cheering And a great move on the baseline by Prior the 11th man to get in the game for Louisville here in the first half And theyve opened it up here 4328 timeout with 5 minutes to go in half number one We talked a lot about rhythm and pace for Mikuel Brown Jr As the play develops youre going to see the ball driven down to the spot Crosscourt kick Look at the head fake right here Head fake Oh just the eyes It wasnt even a head fake frankly His eyes staring at the rim Got Matt Ael off the ground A side step And you talk about him being a rhythm shooter OB hes a guy that once he sees the ball goes in hes in a rhythm but he can do it in a variety of ways Putting music it off the dribble but also doing it from deep Pels who was working diligently with his team in a long workout considering it was a game day workout on passing the ball the flow of the offense Well made 14 baskets nine assists in this one a whistle and a foul Six players already with at least one assist and this one And coming up on ESPN and Boo Shabis already texted both of us saying move it along because this is what you have coming up next laughter Undefeated number one Arizona in Lawrence taking on Darren Peterson and number nine Kansas at Allen Fieldhouse in a dandy Nice job seeking a contact by Hollerman He draws the foul with 448 on the clock Fifth team to shoot it You happy that the Seahawks won last night Not how do you feel about that Not particularly Ive been waiting all day to ask you You know my you know my area code the 617 I live and breathe that it was uh but but look Seattle is the best team in football They proved that definitively all year long in the biggest game They were spectacular You know who I felt bad for All my friends who are Jets fans who got a chance to watch Sam Darnold win a Super Bowl right Poor guys No question 4329 Congratulations to Seattle Man did they deserve it Holman at the line Lets go to Molly Well Obie in their team huddles Louisville head coach Pat Kelce has been emphasizing intensity which is no surprise if youve met Coach Kelsey but hes telling his players to continue to defend with physicality get into their bodies to chase NC State off of the threepoint line A big emphasis of theirs not letting the Wolfpack heat up from long range and theyve done a pretty good job of that so far And conversely Louisville shooting the lights out beyond the threepoint line They had their biggest lead tonight at 16 points So NC State in first half trouble as hot as theyve been Luben trying to cut into it a little bit Khalifa stayed home and he comes away with a loose ball Around the back goes Conwell Everything clicking right now for the Cardinals It was right out of the gate Williams fighting for the loose ball Its tipped back Lumen shovels it AHEAD FOR WILLIAMS SWATTED AWAY BY CONWELL Terrific block Woolly trying to drive it and a foul Are you kidding me applause Calmwell 63 Do you talk about turning the ball over and staying in the play defensively Give me that in the first half You know hes in the flow state And the beautiful thing about the way hes playing right now we talked about pace and patience And I think a lot of times when you missing eight games is a lot of games The game of basketball is similar to anything you do in life Its all about repetition And the more reps you get the more you actually feel the flow and the rhythm of the game And right now youre seeing Muel Brown just in his natural authentic playing style which is catch shoot and being a playmaker Hes been spectacular here tonight 19 points to lead the Bill to an 18point advantage Suess Greenbergs point Vader Copeland one assist on the day and three turnovers Its a guy whos been a phenomenal playmaker for this team averaging seven assists per game Able gets back his miss and knocks that home for his first basket NC State came in playing so well hitting a lot of threes not turning the ball over but theyre getting crushed on the boards That was something that Pat Kelsey talked about needed to have a major advantage Thats going to be goalending by Alubin So to get to 50 still three minutes to go Well there are these little breakdowns defensively for NC State and it comes down to scouting report You know that Conwell is a strong lefthanded driver If anything force him to drive right Those are the miscues that happen defensively that you just have to be sharper when youre going to win games on the road Mike Copeland very frustrated to this point just trying to get off a good shot Theyve made it hard on him Theyll keep it on this end Well if you remember earlier today when we were waiting to talk to Pat Kelsey he said that the the number they want to play fast and then will way told us well I need this game to be in the 70s if were going to have a legitimate chance to win Well Lubas 50 in the first half Abel lost it out of play Its back over to the Cardinals Some frustration starting to show Yeah this is where NC State just needs to dig and start carving their way into this lead Its not going to happen with one shot Its going to start to happen on the defensive end Brown again with a touch loses the dribble finds Prior Jason Prior going in strong and deflected away And a stop there by Copelan Drag screen on the crossover Nice look underneath there for Luben Thats what NC State needs to do Secondhand transition getting that drag screen and allowing Copeland to make reads in the middle of the court Theyre going to turn this over on the shove through Thats his first And the foul will stop the clock at 203 to go And Oklahoma and Bandy coming up tonight at 900 Womens college basketball on ESPN 2 coming your way Reagan Beers number 11 Oklahoma against Michaela Blakes number seven Vandy And of course right after our game Kansas and number one Arizona at Lawrence Fieldhouse with Boo Shabami and Fran Friscilla Darren Peterson playing backto back 30 plus minute games One of the best shot makers we have in the game of basketball going against the size and the physicality of the number one team in the nation the Arizona Wildcats Mike El Brown Jr trying to break 20 points and he will on that bank give him 21 A tremendous half for the freshman cannot answer Are you seeing a top 10 pick in the 2026 NBA draft or what Arsenal with the shove on McNeely commits the foul Once again patience secondhand transition The big gets back He takes the direction on the side Utilizes that frame Thats going against somebody in Copeland whos 67 the difficult shotmaking ability off the right foot in traffic Well you force him out to shoot threes and hes been killing them right now The number six prospect in the upcoming NBA draft for you Whos number one Darren Peterson Its not not even the question anymore Getting a chance to sit courtside in that game against BYU and AJ Deansa The game is so effortless As you look at my top NBA draft prospects I have Peterson AJ Debona Caleb Wilson I think rises above Cameron Boozer I think Cameron Boozers floor is high I think the ceiling for Caleb Wilson is higher Well the coach and the star certainly in lock step in this game and Mike Kell Brown Jr has been splendid and he has just given Louisville a 20point lead in the first half against the hottest team in the conference coming in You know when I think about the top freshman in the country well talk about this in the second half My first 12 picks in the NBA draft are all freshman are all freshman I dont know if thats ever happened before in the history of college basketball Amazing Timeout Eight has missed 19 shots They have exactly one offensive rebound Turn the other way And Louisville is beating him up on the glass Heres Brown again Can they stop him at least one time before the end of the first half Khalifa over the top Good move Roots What a sweet move that was Go to left hand and then just piling it on Roots got a lot of minutes where Mikel Brown Jr was injured Came in and get gave them great energy on the defensive end and also some scoring On the drive a scoop shot up and good by Copelan who has 10 first half points That just makes it again a 20point disadvantage for the Wolfpack out from the left side Got to get Brown a shot If he can hell turn around and fire Not there this time So the last 10 seconds before they head to the locker rooms Louisville got off to a tremendous start They never took their foot off the glass And thats going to be the end of the first half with Louisville leading at 50 Challenges with switching everything is you lose concentration on who and where the shooters are on the floor all the time Well thats not the way the Wolfpack needed the second half to get started as Conwell buries a triple 13 points for Ryan Conwell Most of his shots are from threepoint land Luben in heavy traffic will draw the foul as we get started here in the first half minute of play 5936 Louisville Another foul on Brown his first So we were talking with Will Wade about the schedule and you know this sixgame winning streak Now it did start with an overtime win on the road at Clemson which is a massive win OB a massive win But since then the caliber of teams inside the conference and he said this has not been top draw yet because most of their really tough teams are coming well starting now with Louisville And look theyve shot the ball exceptionally well during that period from the field and also from the threepoint line Defensively I think a lot of the challenge for NC State is the way they start games the sense of urgency If you look at the way Louisville started this game it was a sense of desperation And I know sometimes coaches use cliches do you want it more But you just felt in the first half every 5050 ball was something that Louisville got and NC State did not Conwell reversing field knocks down the shot and draws the foul So Ryan Conwell a senior out of Indianapolis setting to the line looking for a threepoint play Thats his first And talking about a guy that leads the ACC and made threes per game mixing it up in his offensive bag showing you that he can put the ball down the ground and create at the rim as well A really strong upper body frame can play through contact with the best So hes hit a three and now threepoint play against 16 6238 NC State was redot coming in and maybe not playing the toughest as far as opponents but they were playing exceptionally well Copeland on the spin move getting in tight Hes missed a number of those this evening He and Williams have makeable shots on the run Conwell for McNeely back for Brown Jr Hes at it again Give him 24 points Never want him or any Louisville player to turn off when the balls going cheering through with the foul to put Ben Allen Lumin that unique shooting style at the line 10 points for him He was instrumental in that big road win at Clemson with 226 rebounds A long way to go for NC State Down 25 on the road Conwell gone off to a quick start here in the second half Cant convert on the layin and he goes right into a cameraman So numbers here and a swat away by Fu It was just a a five on four You have to find a way you got to give that ball up and get something else Zipping the pass and deflected off of NC State Its a five on four OB Somebody is open You cant dominate the possession by dribbling out the ball So Conwell to put it in Patel talked a lot today about what they learned from the Duke game about being unselfish in the ball having energy and being passed around Everybody getting touches and trying to find that offensive rhythm by getting everybody involved Race for that in the corner and itll go the other way Brown attempting a three That one did not go after he hit five of them in the first half NC State came into this game averaging 86 points a game Kelsey has been very happy with his teams defense for long stretches of the season Not necessarily a Duke He wasnt happy about anything in that one but defensively he likes his team Its a team that when theyre locked in the metrics prove that they could be effective especially with running in transition Once again just having himself a night 27 points Seven out of 10 beyond the threepoint line for Mike El Brown Jr cheering lighting it up Copeland throws it away Picked off by Brown This slam he makes sure of and the lead balloons to 30 applause and cheering cheering and applause tying a careerhigh by El Brown cheering Played for the rebound and it will be the Cardinals ball Copeland typically does a better job of taking care of the ball A 235 to1 assist to turnover ratio Just telegraphed that last pass and Brown Jr was right there in the gap ready to explode in transition Mike Kel tying his careerh high at 29 against Kentucky That makes you an overnight start LOUISVILLE CATCH FIRE NOTHING BUT NETS I mean he is not touching the rim As my friend Anchorman would say that escalated quickly applause 32 a new careerh high cheering Now hes been magic cheering Hes able to fire and short Conwell to push it Corner three The feed and the slam by roots And right now they are just rubbing it in on NC State applause cheering It has gotten out of control here at the Young Center and the fans are loving it here Louisville cheering Holman penetrating the bank shot and a whistle too So a rare positive moment for the Wolfpack Needed that just to get for 42 points Theres so many lessons Ive learned from him OB in business Obviously he became one of the largest franchise owners in the country Over 100 Wendys and Chile locations at the peak He acquired companies like Ebony and Jet Magazine At his peak his net worth was over 600 million But ultimately the way he led his life the way he treated his family and the way he mentored young athletes um was just incredible You call him he would pick up the phone he would spend time with you He would be patient with you and I love when players like that give back to the community Ali Khalipa as the C parted for him and the Cardinals just laying it on Junior would love this tonight Also he would love to mentor a lot of these young players who are making millions of dollars to play this game And this game has become professionalized That is okay to say out and aloud And these teams are around these young players and you hope they can achieve the success It all starts with surrounding yourself with smart people 774513 for Van Allen Luben But 32 already for Mike Brown Jr McNeely let fly Threepointers have been deadly tonight for Louisville They have been in this string of games Theyve been winning Great ball movement there for the Wolfpack We havent seen a lot of that tonight but Panel and Luben again Lets bring in Molly McGrath Louisville doesnt plan to let up despite this large lead The first thing coach Pat they never take their foot off the gas even though theyre up 30 plus points playing this game zero to zero sets the stage for how theyre going to play in their next several games Brown has matched the Louisville alltime freshman record with 32 points Just a matter of time when he breaks that set by the Bradford Smith and may very well do it on this possession Just under 14 minutes to go at Louisville Also for NC State youre not going to get back in this game off one or two shots Its going to come from a series of defensive stops Brown behind the back look for Khalifa Way things have been going tonight But the Cardinals Im surprised that didnt go in A whistle and a foul on the baseline Crowd not enamored of that call Thats on Isaac McNeely number one So the fans are digging in deep as well They want every possession They want every call to go their way despite the Giant lead Well thats four fouls now on Louisville If I were NC State I would continue to attack the paint get to the free throw line try to stop this clock and carve into this lead Hand off for Hollowman Williams Conan again Arsenal got an opening and lays it in Arsenal Little eight nothing run here for the Wolfpack which they really needed in the opening minutes of the game to counter Louisville Thats when they got off to the races and started hitting those threes as Conwell burries another one 19 for Conwell So thats around his season average Able tough move there will draw the foul cheering Foul number 13 8051 Then our ESPN NBA Wednesday double header coming your way Loaded with star power Jaylen Brunson and the Knicks in Philly taking on Embiid in the Sixers And Wy and the Spurs squaring off against the Warriors Its NBA Countdown tipping off at seven We could be looking at an NBA finals of the New York Knicks versus the Spurs if the Spurs can get through beating a team like Oklahoma City But man Victor Wimayama is a special player to watch Him and Castle the way they defend their size their length and theyre going to be one of the powerhouses in the NBA for a long time And dont let them get a top 15 NBA draft pick Dont let that happen as well with the talent thats in college basketball Able a freshman from Baltimore a consensus fourstar recruit and smooth at the line Four points for Ael and for NC State Louisville doing a really good job of getting into the paint But look let them take a tough two You have to stay home on threepoint shooters And that is Connie McNeely on the court right now Mcilly pounding the floor Gives it up Seven to get off a shot Zuberus on about speed Connival got tangled up there and hit as he spun the shot up there with 12 minutes to go Those with just 47 on the shot clock And able number two And one of the disadvantages to switching everything is Luben was guarding Connley on the perimeter got caught standing up defensively Connley recognized that saw he was overextended back door cut him right to the rim So Conwell to the line he makes 83 You played in a lot of these games when you were starring at Duke You had a huge lead late You were star Would Coach K take you out here for an extended period of time just to give you a little bit of a rest stay away from injuries a little bit or were you just dying to get right back in No I wanted to win the game by 60 if I could And um I I know some people might think thats unsportsmanlike but I really dont give a damn I mean and thats how we played right Its if we won by 60 I wanted to win by 70 And if anything I think it set the tone cheering for how you felt next time we played against you So you never want to take your foot off that gas Able going airborne Theyll get zerous for the foul Crowd does not like that cheering Thats the right call cheering So to be able at the line once again Im not sure if its good for your health to be running into the 6A junior from Greece Zuberus Four years in Greek Pro League He laughed cuz he knew he couldnt get both feet outside the restricted area All right lets go He is built like a Greek god Ill tell you that Makes me want to go home and do some pushups and abs You and I both for about six years Says the athlete he most admires is the great Leon Messi and before the dipsy do attempt there by Brown A foul 1153 to go five assist to ratio assist to turnover ratio and a guy averaging seven assists per game So far in this game only two assists with four turnovers and theyve limited how many touches hes had on the ball So Copelan watching from the bench picked up a couple of fouls but more than anything else its been the dominating play of the Cardinals all the way around Reason hes on the pine right now music So 1153 remaining Nice crowd here as there usually is at the KFC Yum Center on a very cold night They have loved what they have seen from Jump Street And now Brown working on a 32point game Shot clock to eight Conwell hes been a hot hand in the second half Boy hes tough to stop on a drive like that Taking some punishment but making a shot Hell head to the line How about that What a strong righthanded drive And look how he brings the ball to his left hand to finish up and underneath away from the extension of the defender number five You know hes a guy that gets to the free throw line about four times a game but with his size and frame he should be getting to the free throw line eight to nine free throw attempts So good at drawing contact and then finishing through it Looking for his 24th point and short on that one but back up to 30 for Louisville able back for Williams They have locked him up tonight Nice dish there Hes a very good passer Valon Luben could not make the shot I should say Sier cannot make the shot Its a good pass by Darren Williams but you want him to shoot that ball Its point blank at the rim He has to get that shot up Brown a determined drive spins it up there and a foul on the play with 1106 to go and thats going to be against him Lets check in with Molly Well guys Louisville playing with a lot of physicality tonight and head coach Pat Kelsey as the team go through what they call football practices to set the standard for toughness and physicality and team captain Kobe Rogers described them to us and said theyre the best practices we have a good up and down fourminute war where we dont worry about fouling just play hardnosed basketball And these practices so physical that coaches often have to wear pads and players I spoke with said the better the football practice the more physical they play in their games that week You dont have to worry about fouls Heres Brown Yes yet another threepointer and a new careerhigh 35 And thats a freshman record applause and cheering here at Louisville The kick out for Williams and too strong And another rebound for Briman Really good on the glass too Hes got eight rebounds Fitting it inside Prior Oh got a bunny Couldnt hit it Well the Cardinals with a terrific night here at home It started out so well and they never let up Able with a pullup pop in and out Mikel Brown is absolutely on fire but Im still unsure how he gets so much space on the perimeter and how NC State is just not applying pressure 247 Conwell smokes one from threepoint land Hes right behind him He is 26 They had made 15 of cheering 21 Well all year theyve been among the most prolific threepoint shooting teams in the country They put on a show in this one NC State with a quick answer but 9056 applause and cheering Well lets see where it takes us in the last several minutes here Brown will drive it again Lays it up and in What creates the drive is the fact that hes made the last seven threes Now all of a sudden theres a sense of urgency to get out and contest the shot but his eyes on the rim is the ball fake he needs and gets him an easy lay Tough drive there Holliver And a foul too Hes headed for the line for a threepoint play And just look at this space right here as he comes off Let him play Look at that space Look how do you give him that much space Theres no way you can give him that much space He steps right into it And of course that was Conwell hitting that one I mean they did it to Mel Brown too off switching everything and lack of communication Those guys been left wide open from the outside And those guards have the green light Do they ever I mean look we can talk about the lack of communication or the sense of urgency by NC State but right now were seeing the ceiling of how good Louisville can be Mhm And if youre watching this game tonight as a Cardinal fan youre thinking to yourself Hey we can beat North Carolina Hey we can beat Duke if we play this way Now granted you may not shoot this percentage from the threepoint line every time but just the ability to extend the floor with the way these guys are playing this evening a sense of urgency defensively you can compete against anybody Copeland with a misfire Hes had a tough night Came in the best player in the conference over the last week Hollerman no And Khalifa with another rebound 37 points tonight for Mike Brown Jr with the basketball at the logo You think hes thinking about 40 OB Got to be right You would be 1000 Conwell is too Brown Jr held up flips it up there Hell draw the foul on the dribble Dicky B and the battle against pediatric cancer Louisville just continues to lay it on Theyre really embarrassing NC State They almost have a 100 points and we just got done with the under eight timeout Uh there is no doubt about it They are making a statement this evening Before that basket they were shooting 61 68 from three Able an awkward looking drive but the follow is up and good And Aluma with a basket to give him 17 On the other end fast strike by Hadley NC State just didnt get back Copeland will lift off the mark The thing is Louisville is still pushing the ball Uh theyre playing with a sense of urgency Hadley with another one Theyre truly treating this game as if its 000 Closing in on a 100 and a foul as well 647 to go See this pass right here just look at the vision just having his head up seeing it from the side crossing over So Kobe Rogers running the offense Ben Allen Luben back to the stripe 70 foul shooter And then a threepoint play Hes been one bright spot tonight with 20 for the Wolfpack Came in averaging 13 but not many of them Ali Khalifa Conwell beyond the three Loves to live out there Shot clock to 10 McNeely open Seeing a little bit of that Egyptian magic there on the passing Fun to watch Copeland tucking that shoulder Ben Allen Lubman with the rather unusual shooting style So trying to get to 100 but a little too strong there for Hadley And Brown coming back on Mike El Brown Jr working on a 37point game which is the freshman record new freshman record for Louisville Hadley hits the bench and Conwell will come out as well for Pat Kelsey Are they going to put him back in So can I tell you something OB Its 6 minutes left to go in this game music Youre up 34 points Not only do I think Pat Kelsey is sending a message to NC State I think hes sending a message to the nation that we dont care how many points were up this is who we are and were not going to stop playing Louisville basketball Look how everybodys down in the stands Theyre still communicating Theyre still showing hard on screens Theyre still getting deflections Theyre playing as if a team theyre the team down 30 points in this game applause Conwell getting a really nice hand as he steps out applause with 28 Brown junior is three points away from 40 Hollerman flips it up and drops in a basket 9866 Louisville cheering See if Mike Cal gets another three Hes been a threepoint shooting machine Hes going to go for two He banks it and draws a foul Foul I tell you what Pat Kelsey is still as you said coaching this game like its 6565 coming down to the last possession He is just absolutely screaming like Canai Root about switching on that last play on Hollowman staring him down And at some point you think you got to get Mike Brown Jr out of the game 38 points for him And coming up ACC Network mens basketball on Wednesday Virginia Tech and Clemson hoping not to stumble on their way to Duke on Saturday at Wake Forest and Georgia Tech at 9ine RJ Goffrey one of the top players in the ACC And Clemson a team that just does it by committee as Louisville has hit the 100 mark with 522 left to go in the second half Now Mike Brown with nine threepointers School record is 10 incidentally So he still has a few things individually to play for although this has

know exactly how many points he has She is 39 You let fly too strong What a rebound Gets it back He steps into another one Wont shoot it Directing a little traffic Heres his three cheering Well theyve

evening Again they got that quick first step They had a 13point lead very early in the game I mean real early because of that guy in particular And they just never stop I tell you theres no better feeling as a starter or a guy that plays a lot of minutes than when some of your players that show up every single day in practice that do all the grunt work on the scout and reports they take you through it they talk you through it get a chance to come in like Sherman and knock down the three So the final seconds what has been a glorious night for the Louisville Cardinals the number 24 team in
