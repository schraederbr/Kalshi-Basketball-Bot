league and beating Cal Bill Cington will throw it up Isaac Barnett Anthony Eids are officials Carter Welling Carson Tout for the jump ball Tout a little jumpy and Welling wins the tip for the 13 and3 Clemson Tigers 30 in the league Wins at Syracuse at Pittsburgh and Wednesday impressively at home against number 24 SMU You can see early the point of emphasis is to get the basketball inside the guard That should open up opportunities on the perimeter for everyone else in white RJ Godfrey where zero is the leading scoreer at just 12 a game Extremely balanced Clemson team and Dylan Hunter averaging nine a game has the first two I believe when you talk about balance you have to look into the dictionary and you would find Brad Brownell and the Clemson Tigers You have eight guys averaging over five points per game and no ones scoring over 12 tonight Starting five for Notre Dame Logan Ims Braden Trusbury a terrific shooter in Harelson The guards Garrett Sundra Carson Tout are the bigs Heres the 67 freshman Harelson who shot is rebounded by the 611 junior Carter Welling A lot of transfers for Clemson which is unusual for Bradell Returned just one rotation player that was Hunter Godfrey who was at Clemson went to Georgia and transferred back in Just had a shot blocked and thats out of bounds Apparently last touch by Godfrey in the starting lineup with Justin Porter Jake Wallen and Carter Welling Garrett Hunter doing a nice job defensively right there He gave up the baseline to Godfrey but using his limp to be able to get over and block the shot offensively for Notre Dame Cory what do you look for early Well when you consider Notre Dame and you think about the fact that youre not playing you dont have your leading score in Burton This is the guy Braden Shrewsbury whos going to have to be aggressive on the offensive end as Harelson knocks down the three ball That has not been his strong suit throughout the year only shooting 154 but you can see improving and putting the work in from beyond the arc He hadnt made one until last game against Cali Hit two early as another early three in the ensuing Irish game Its a Clemson team that plays at one of the slowest tempos in the ACC wrapped into Godfrey by Hunter Walling gets a quick double team Cant find an outlet Tout knocks the ball away and its a shot clock violation for Patty Irish bigs But look at the size of the trap You talked about it When youve got Sundra at 610 tout at 68 trapping Godfrey along that baseline where it adds another defender Thats a significant defensive stop for the Irish Notre Dame at 10 and5 coming off a 15 and 18 year 812 in the lead They look much improved even without Marcus Burton Heres the junior Logan IMS coming off a careerhigh six assists and eight rebounds though he didnt score Made a big impact at Cal Yeah And is in the game as he lines up a three is able to knock it down but hes in the game primarily to be the primary on ball defender Michael Shrewsbury told us earlier without Marcus Burton they need someone who can guard the ball Logan has been that guy Clemson which never trailed Wednesday against SMU down 62 as Justin Porter cuts into the lead 37 threepoint shooter with a triple And Porter really has been a significant advantage for Brad Brownell and Clemson giving him the other double figure score Time stepped out of bounds Notre Dames first turnover Third year for Micah Shrewsbury This program has grown a little bit every year yearoveryear Picked 10th in the ACC They returned more than half their scoring though Again a lot of that on the bench with Burton But he brought in Cory a very strong very well reggarded freshman class Yes And they continue to recruit freshman which is almost unconventional right now But this Notre Dame program is about retention and development Terrific find by Welling Jake Wallen hits an early three and the last 12 points in the game have come from two Notre Dame threes and now two Clemson threes And great ball movement against the trap Clemson prepared that time with the trapping in the post to get it out and find one of the shooters on the perimeter Heres IMS an offensive foul will send it the other way going against Garrett Sundra Brad Brownell 16th year at Clemson Most wins at Clemson longest tenure coach in the ACC The win Wednesday against SMU Cory that was a real identity win for this program Talking to Andy Enfield before that game he said We want it in the 9s Clemson wants it in the 60s and Clemson want it in the 70s Yeah And again thats Brad Bros calling card is what they do defensively Hes built a number of great offensive teams but their core theyre always going to be a good defensive unit Moving the ball around very well as Welling misses a three First miss from deep for Clemson Aen Shrewsbury second leading threepoint shooter in the ACC 46 had five threes against Cal a week ago Heres a three for Sundra Too strong and tipped into the hands of Dylan Hunter But unbelievable ball movement by the Fighting Irish on that one That was a play that you clip even though you didnt make the shot RJ Gotfrey bullies inside and now four of the five Clemson starters have scored It was amazing We were able to sit in on the Notre Dame film session and one of the things that Michael Shbury talked about was you got to feel what that first duck in is going to be like And now Garrett Sundra felt it from RJ Garfield on that possession Shrewsbury in the lane Back rims Eight in a row for Clemson which is shooting four for six in the early segment Wallen for three In and out Applause Clemsons first subs will check in after the next whistle Ace Buckner Nick Davidson but a Johnson all to the table Applause Heres Harelson Pulls up for another three THAT ONES GOOD AS WELL BUT you can see the confidence growing in Jaylen Harlson We mentioned coming in hes only shooting 15 from three but already two of two beyond the arc in this game as he continues to grow in his role Strong attack by Godfrey and he draws a foul Looks like its the second against Sundra 109 lead Good shooting early here in Notre Dame Hes becoming more comfortable but his coach Michael Shberry told us that he is seeing something different each and every time out RJ Godfrey at the line That foul was the second on Garrett Sundra Cole Cerna Brady Kaylor are into the game for Shrewsbury and Sunder Music John thank you very much Iowa State remains undefeated on a day where weve already lost one undefeated team in Michigan here in Notre Dame Indiana A team thats undefeated in the league Clemson with two ACC road wins looking for a third road win in four games seeking a 4 and0 ACC start And Cory the Tigers have shot it well so far Four for seven Notre Dame not far behind at three for six as we get a block shot and a foul Nick Davidson fouls the Notre Dame big Carson Tower Early shooting Notre Dame three of four from three And the big story there Courty Jaylen Harlson who would not get a threepointer at his first 13 college games had two against Cal and he has two already today And Jaylen Harlson also playing the point guard position makes a nice find to tout on the way to the basket Michael Shrewsbury told us Whoa that was a little bit long there when you consider the uh free throw attempt going glass first by tout That that kind of caught me off guard Yeah he did that against Cal last game and it had the same result Hes 10 for 24 That one is in Okay So the attempt is to bank the free throw in Okay Unconventional but effective on the second free throw Coaches always told me that square is there for a reason Yeah Im not sure Im not sure if thats the reason 1110 the Clemson lead Tigers had buckets from four starters which is right in line for an extremely balanced Clemson team coming off a fourpoint win at home over SMU Jake Wallin misses a three And the rebounds knocked out of bounds off of Davidson Itll go to Notre Dame If youre just joining us Notre Dame again without Marcus Burton Preseason all ACC Hes going to be out for a while still after a broken left ankle against TCU December 5th Without him this freshman Harelson has played a lot more on the ball averaging 15 points four rebounds two and a half assists per game Ducks inside here uses the window and puts the Irish in front Maybe its something they work on with the Fighting Iris in second possession where somebody went off glass for at least one point Marlene kicks it to the red shirt freshman Ace Butner Clemson team with only one returning rotation player from last year Butner sat out the year with a shoulder injury Heres Chase Thompson who misses a three Rebounded by the Notre Dame freshman Brady Kaylor And one of the things the Fighting Irish have done pretty well thus far is theyve been limiting Clemson to one opportunity Some of them they may but when they havent Notre Dame has not given up any offensive rebound Funning Irish team that won 4740 at Stanford last week and lost 7271 in a late fourpoint play at Cap Kaylor gets fouled by Davidson who picks up a quick second Tayen Harelson has the ability to play with the ball in his hands at 67 once he gets into the painted area the enough size and strength to be able to finish over the top And Jaylen Harlson is the freshman thats not getting enough love When you consider how much weve talked about the freshman all season long so many different guys that are playing great basketball He really needs to be included in that conversation Over 14 points per game And thats after only being able to play partially in game one of this year Got a concussion in that game Missed their second game but since has not had a single digit scoring game Off to a great start today We had a conversation pregame and he didnt know that hes scoring in every game Double figures in every game which you were nervous about then but well hes already got eight Hes not at 10 No announcer jinx on my young fell 1411 as Notre Dame brings in a couple more subs Kevin Jai the 610 senior and Mark Zachary Carter Welling to the basket Count the bucket and a foul Welling the fifth Clemson starter to get on the scoreboard can tie it at the line And this is one of the things that Michael Shrewberry talked to his team about When the big guys from Clemson catch the basketball in the middle of the floor they arent necessarily looking to move it side to side They are looking to play oneonone find their way downhill just like Welling did on the last possession 66 free throw shooter will tie the game at 14 Dallas Thomas checks in for Wall for Clemson So both teams go deep into the bench early but they change the matchup now Its Butter Johnson who goes up to try to pick up Harelson 94 ft But thats one of the points of empisence for Clemson Theyre not going to allow him to be comfortable Nice trap right there Passed over it to Kaylor Johnson crashes down Got a piece of the rebound which is grabbed by Ace Butner Johnson Applause Butner takes a three Thats good Ace Butner the 62 red shirt freshman just his 63 of the year And of course son of Clemson legend Greg Buckner whos now with the Milwaukee Bucks coaching an Ace getting in the scoring column early Its a young man Hes the only person throughout this season to lead Clemson in both scoring and rebounding in the same game Another three Haroldson turned into Steph Curry IN THE LAST TWO GAMES And so now we get a little bit of a look to the sideline because he is in double figures already with 11 points and now a careerhigh three made field goal Welling trying to rip down the rim is fouled again Pretty entertaining start here Clemson to Notre Dame 17 all Looks like you can appreciate Michael Shrewsbury and his statement afterwards but I completely understand his reaction I mean again in the heat of the moment as competitors you lose it And again youre talking about a team that has not been 2 and 0 ever in the ACC They had a chance to be able to do that And with both games being on the road and to be able to lose it in that fashion Im not saying that he was right cuz he didnt say that he was right But Im telling you right now I completely understand Michael Suss reaction Its been a lot more measured this year generally Micah Shrewsburys got a much better team this year too Some good wins for Notre Dame They were almost the first team to go on that Cal Stanford ACC West Coast swing and win both Justin Porter just took it away from an unassuming Sir Mohamd An easy pick and score for Porter But you can see the difference with Sir Muhammad running the point guard position in comparison to Jaylen Harrison who has handled the basketball extremely well against the pressure Clemson is going to guard you 94 ft Thats one of the reasons why they play 10 players to keep someone fresh to pressure the basketball Shrewberry is defender Thomas fell down and Shrewberry is the third Notre Dame player to bank in a shot Yeah thats more conventional though and again a great shooter like Michael Shenberry is no mistake when he goes to the glass 20 to 19 the Clemson lead Godfrey Thomas in the corner Porter in and out for three Offensive rebound Welling up with the left hand No Kevin Jai rips down the rebound in the crowd Applause Shrewsbury thought about firing off the screen from Jai Shrewsbury should never think about it It should always happen when youre shooting 45 from three It should never be a thought And Mohamds called for a travel second turnover More mens college basketball tonight over on ESPN Texas and Alabama in Tuscaloosa following our game at 8 Eastern 7 central And then AJ Debatza and number nine BYU travel to Utah Thats all following us on ESPN and the ESPN app Already been a wild day including the first loss this year for number two Michigan 9188 at home to Wisconsin Welling denied at the rim Both Kaylor and Tout were there for a Notre Dame team that blocks the fewest shots in the ACC That was a meeting at the summit A nice pocket pass from Hunter to Welling but you mentioned it I believe its Kaylor who got a little got a little arm on that on that one as well Tout credit You know in the NFL players can get a half sack Should be a half block each Welling is fouled Must be a continuation Oh thats a bucket Love the stick to it Welling splitting the defenders coming down to try to get keep him away from the rim Tout a little late trying to get there to take him away Gets to the opposite side of the basket and uses the glass the conventional way Taylors hit with his second foul Few seconds after he may have gotten a little piece of Welling He gets a lot of him here Hell stay in the game for now with two Welling converts his second threepoint play and he leads the way with seven for Clemson Logan six for 10 for Notre Dame But they turn it over again Kaylor throws it right to Porter when you can see when the reserves come into the game for the Fighting Irish theyre not as adept at handling the pressure that Clemson puts on you defensively And theres no drop off from Clemson when they go to the bench Applause Leading the ACC in bench points per game Gets a miss three from Hunter So now you look at it its actually the starting lineup for the Tigers on the floor right now playing against a number of the reserves I nice move inside for I follows up a scoreless game Saturday with an early five And I becoming much more aggressive as everyone really has without Burton on the floor having to expand their roles on the offensive end Applause Godfrey drives it into the brick wall of Tout Godfrey to the right hand draws a foul against Tout Thats his second and he becomes the third Notre Dame big with two first half fouls So when you say Godfrey runs into the brick wall of talent does that mean a brick wall is running into another brick wall Those two guys are alone and you mentioned it Micah Shros Shrewsburg told his team you got to feel that first duck in from RJ God 67 240 senior They felt a couple already as Godfrey hits the first and Ryder Frost going to check into the game as you mentioned the foul trouble up front Frost had 25 points in his first two games with the Fighting Irish and in the next 10 five Hes only got five points which by the way all came against Houston Yes Well go figure The only team you scored against in the last 10 is the best defensive team in America the last half decade I mean but I can only imagine like you score 15 in your debut I mean you got to be feeling pretty good about things and back it up with a double double figure game in game two and then all of a sudden you dont score again Applause Harelsons been out for a little while here for Notre Dame and hes going to come to the scores table right now with a fourpoint Clemson lead Well the the offense has stalled with Harelson on the bench and a lot of it has to do with Crimson being able to ratchet up his his pressure especially on the basketball and the ball handler after scores off a missed three by Mohamd But Buckner is cut off on the baseline Clemson eight for 17 to start Has only turned it over one time Notre Dames out shooting them but theyve turned it over and that ball is in Got deflected in for a goal 10 The bucket good anyway for Buckner A great feed by Godrey Carson Town only one foul Harlsons been great Cory but Clemson only one turnover Has a sixpoint lead Well and when you consider look at the three white jerseys up front the pressure Wine doing a nice job of pressuring Harelson but hes prepared for it Clemson was really able to take a lead in this game when Harelson goes to the bench off of a number of turnovers because the Fighting Irish werent unable to handle the pressure Shrewsbury only two points early only two shots Well defended for to shoot I switch on to the freshman Thompson I gets by him I gets it in Seven points for Logan Ives A 37 per game score And veteran move by I recognizing with 4 seconds he had more than enough time to be able to get to the rim Didnt have to force a bad shot from the perimeter Buckner into Godfrey RJ Godfrey barrels it home Seven points for Godfrey coming off of the second highest scoring game of the year 17 on Wednesday and Ryder Frost the next in line to feel that duck in by RJ Godfrey as Goffrey was able to finish without much resistance Shrewberry has really not been able to shake free for a clean look as it attempted a three a deep one Heres Wallen for Clemson Notre Dame without an offensive rebound in the game Step back three No good from Johnson Applause Theres Shrewsbury Finally gets a look and missed it Got a hard screen by J to Spring Applause Thompson for three Now a whistle mercifully stops this brick barrage Debbie Antonelli in the building Just you two will be calling that game tomorrow Im not doing Youre not calling that game No Mark Ney will be Oh Mark Neils calling that game with Debbie Okay Well you and Debbie you know did the double header Yes Yeah Okay Was a double header We did double header last week Its all very confusing Yeah it is Thats what Im saying We did a double header at Clemson last week You know we deal at NC State and UNCC last week We were at Clemson Wednesday and then were both here today Shes not working Shes just sitting five seats down from you Well I mean she is a you know when not doing air a Clemson fan You You were unaware of that Calling her out No I mean again Debbie her her did you not know about Debbie Debbie and I worked 100 games in a row until today travel against I thought you going to say Debbie is a hoops junkie shes not working that she definitely is that 100 tomorrow Debbie will be there and itll be a great game North Carolina and Notre Dame two good ones in the ACC Duke which is 50 in the league and Stanford 4 one five Eastern Sevenpoint lead for the Tigers here Notre Dame with six turnovers shooting 53 Harlson knocked away by Porter has had a careerhigh four steals Wednesday and already has two And a great job by Porter really in the passing lanes right there Close enough to Shrewsbury to get the deflection but able to disrupt the offensive possession for the Fighting Irish really like Porters improvement Transfer from Middle Tennessee Hes been a lot more active defensively of late Gets into Shrewsbury here Too late Its a three for Braden His first of the game And the size of Braden Shrewberry allows him to be able to shoot over a smaller defender especially trying to trail him off of a screen Porter Music Butner for Wallin missed it in the corner Rebound to Jai Three rebounds off the bench for Kevin Jai And Shrewberry will have that catch negated by an offensive foul Braden Shrewsbury A little chase action going away from it and then getting it back The nice screen by Tal enough to free him up to use his size to shoot over the top of a smaller Porter trying to catch up to him And you see the threepoint field goal leaders throughout this season thus far Ray Truberry second with 48 also second in percentage to Jakari White of Virginia who has been out but shooting 50 from beyond the arcber had an 83 game earlier in the year against Evansville 3026 the Clemson lead that foul was the third on Kev Jai he is still in this game three first half fouls with four and a half to gos going to go right at him and Jai goes straight straight up Good defense by the senior who came over with Micah Shrewsbury from Penn State and a travel called against Tout Now Ace Buckner trying to poke the ball away from him and Anthony Eid has to get in between the two But its amazing when you see that Remember Michael Shberry comment to us earlier today about tout is like the big brother and everyone feels better when the big brothers around and again tout taking a little exception to ace Buckner trying to swipe the basketball away from him as hes trying to explain to the official that he didnt travel even though it was called a travel The eight Notre Dame turnover Hunter cuts got the feed from the big up top and left it short Clemson has missed its last five Shrewberry three is well short I believe Florida got a piece of that one Deflected a ton of passes Might have tipped that shot as well Wine Keeps his pivot foot down Misses rebound Shrewberry and he was out of bounds when he got the ball Extremely well When you consider throughout his career here theyre six and six without Marcus Burke But this year three and two and a lot of that is because of the the emergence of Jaylen Harlson at the point guard position and not only because of what they do offensively I think there may be a better defensive team because of the size and theres no mismatches without Burton on the floor However Michael Shbury made it very clear to us he doesnt have another player that can guard the basketball the way Burton does And they dont have a timeline for his return yet Fourpoint Clemson lead Tigers have not hit from the field in over three minutes Porter end of the shot clock Heave draws the iron and its off of Welling out of bounds to Notre Dame But thats a great example of what Notre Dame can do defensively simply because with the size along this lineup you can switch And when you switch theres no mismatch So at Harlson with the point guard at 67 you got Shrewsbury at 64 65 Everyone else is 68 and up on the floor and so theres no differentiator when it comes to mismatches on the block but also these guys can guard on the perimeter Havent shot it in a while He gets fouled here by Wall just third on Clemson And listening in to coach Greens message from studio Clemson only two fouls You got to attack the basket Put some pressure on the officials to be able to get to the rim Jaylen Harlson Im just not sure he heard coach Green but I did But Jaylen recognizing that and getting right to the rim putting that pressure on to be able to get to the free throws right 63 free throw shooter out of Anderson Indiana the recruiting ranking Hes the highest ranked recruit ever at Notre Dame 19th overall because there have been some guys recruited here who have probably been the best players in the country or close to it but they were not in the ranking system You go back and you think of course AD Adrien Dantley recruited by the gentleman you got to meet today Thats right Digger Phelps along the sideline and of course the great Lefonso Ellis was a top five prospect in the country when he was coming out of high school Godfrey into tal Godfrey wins it with a left hand this time and becomes the Tigers first double figure scorer of the game Nice play there by Randle Godfrey not even working on going back to that right hand but using the left hand showing his development We talked about the Fighting Irish and how retention and development is such a huge part of their program How about RJ Godfrey developing in the Clemson program spending a year at Georgia and then recognizing theres no place like home Heading back to the Tigers The Orange Slippers still fit for her way I thought I had some action Always shot ready but it was a little short Third Clemson turnover The nice trap on the interior and waiting for Godrey when he was able to get to play oneonone gets to that left hand and able to finish over the top Porter foul Shrewsbury on a cut RJ Godfrey said to Brad Brownell this is a great piece in the Charleston Posting Courier that when he left to go to Georgia he told Brad Brownell he loved him and it was part of a business deal the reality of college sports these days he started every game at Georgia last year boomerang back home to Clemson He said I took for granted Brad Brownells philosophies the first two years how theyve helped me in life and he has been a real leader real focal point The team with so many new faces Kaylor off the bobble Not have deserved it but he got it But heres the best part about it and I I doubt we have it The reaction from Michael Truzberry Once Caleb took the shot he immediately just put his hands on the top of his head Like what are you doing And thats one of the no no yes shots Porter answers with a rattledin three Second three for Justin Porter whos got eight And Clemson which has led most of the way is back up six Harlson attacking into Wallen The Utah transfer Harlson leaves it short Wallen grabs a rebound The final minute and change of a first half thats been controlled by the visitors Porter shot fake drives it and gets fouled Thats on the way up A twoshot foul going against Notre Dame The cut the bobble and then the onelegged fall away But during this entire my bad whenever you say my bad when you made the shot you can only imagine I just wish we had the reaction from Micah Shrew He immediately wants Cull to shoot the basketball put his hands on top of his head and hes still going to be subbed out even though he made the shot and having a conversation with Coach Ruse He didnt want to look Great job Never again Cathedral High School Brady Kaylor So he shares that with Micah Shrewsbury a couple of Indiana natives same alma moater Applause Life as a freshman Thats it Its life as a freshman And Coaches love them and you got to live with those type of plays even though it didnt end up being a mistake Shersbury jumps out to stop a potential three I driving I leans in Couldnt get the roll Offensive rebound to Tout He sticks it up and in The first offensive rebound of the game for Notre Dame And Tout one of the best in the country defensively and offensively on the glass Leads the ACC in offensive rebounding over three per game with this first second chance point to this one Leading active rebounder in all of Division One Northern Arizona for four years 10 seconds in the half Porter on a cut He scores it What a sweet stroke from Justin Porter whos got a dozen but left enough time for a quality look Cole Serta banks it home Well if there was no backboard Notre Dame might be down 20 Thats their fourth bank in the second half One more Saturday night in early January from PCEL Pavilion with a fivepoint Clemson lead and an early Tiger foul Starting fives are out for both teams Ims Harlson Shrewberry Sundra and Tout for the Irish Dylan Hunter who picked up that foul Porter Godfrey Wallen and Carter Welling with seven points three assists Clemson five man in the first half knocks this ball over the scorers table And how about this Notre Dame with a 7 to five bench points advantage Clemson comes into the game the number one bench scoring team in the ACC close to 33 points per game They only had five bench points in this one And thats one of the strengths of this Clemson Tiger team is that they score and they have so much strength in numbers Only Ace Butner of the five reserve Tigers scored 34 from the starters I had seven in that first half Good drop off for Touty whos blocked but foul And a nice job by Tout allow Dylan Hunter who was trying to block the shot from behind to fly by Nice drop off by as you mentioned the pocket pass but as Hunter flies by Tout is able to go up strong and Welling comes in with the foul So Carson Tout put his first two free throws off the glass One of them went in I love that Bill Cington Jr going over having a conversation with Carson Tout And again Im sure it had something to do with conversation a little talking whatever it may be but theres no technical foul Theres none of that Its just a simple conversation Thats the thing that you love most about experienced officials They understand how to take care of a problem before it becomes a problem You dont think Bill reminded him now you can use the backboard here I dont think that had anything to do with it I dont think BC is is giving out free throw shooting tips And if so Tal did not listen One for two again Welling floats it home And Clemson has had a big night from the junior transfer to Utah Valley Carter Welling leading rebounders second and seals tied for the team lead in blocks and scoring at just under 10 a game And a nice impactful transfer out of the whack Harlson into Wallin A lot of contact there and no foul up ahead Porter three for Clemson Notre Dame rushes back in transition Justin Porter on a step back Finds Hunter for three Its good Dylan Hunter and Clemson has its largest lead of nine I was talking with player development coach Terrell McIntyre Clemson legend earlier and I asked him I said Does Dylan Hunter need to be more aggressive on the offensive end of the floor He told me straight up CA hes doing exactly what Brad is asking him to do in running the team Shooting at 41 from three Hunter first three years was 27 Ninepoint lead missed three by Shrewsbury And heres Clemson with Hunter again Wallen set up for three and Tout grabs a rebound Sixth of the game for Tout 1241st of his career Most headbutt right there between players Yeah its well two guys with a similar headbands similar mops of hair Eric Sundrew was limited to few minutes in that first half but foul trouble Missed a three Sun taking on the responsibility of having to defend RJ Godfrey Thats thats part of thats a scouting report turnover right there Luis heard Michael Shrewsbury and his staff talk about these guys are trying to play off the bounce when they catch the ball at the top of the key Theyre not really trying to go side to side That time is able to get in and disrupt the drive from Wells Applause with the ball right now Skips it to Sundra Didnt want to shoot the three Ives will I is everywhere 10 points just too shy of a careerhigh already And the adjustment to get Ims into the starting lineup was a defensive move but its been an offensive push here for Michael Shberry today His third straight after 13 off the bench A cutting Hunter will bank it in Clemson uses the window and two buckets in the second half for Dylan Hunter And I like Dylan Hunter playing a little more aggressively because he is the third leading scoreer on this team And its the returning all the returning points So hes the guy that understands the culture as to what Bradell wants that Clemson grit as they call it Eightpoint lead for Clemson Harlson spinning Theres contact and a foul against Wall Its his second Harlson will shoot two Music Applause A nice job by Sundra finding him who relocates Able to knock down the three And on the other end Dylan Hunter who just knocked down the three of his own Now attacking the basket able to finish through a little bit of contact high off the glass And no it wasnt a floater Kevin did I say it was a floater You probably did Applause reflexive for you You did say someone floats at home earlier but not a floater Okay thats different It is different Ive worked with you enough I dont want to wake up the beast that is the floater Cory Alexander The dueling duos today 22 a piece for Godfrey and Porter Harlson and I surprising duo for Notre Dame in terms of Logan Ims in his 37 a game Hes got 10 Harelson now 13 as Putner has come off the bench along with Nick Davidson for Clemson Hunter and Welling to the bench Butlers pass deflected found its way to Godford But Buckner spots up for three Way too strong Its going to stay with Clemson with seven to shoot Tigers led by five and a half Have extended it to six football home games The Bears are playing by the way in a little bit against the Packers That guys going to be dialed in So who you got You got the Steelers at home home underdog and Aaron Rogers or the Texans on the road on Monday You know Ive got way too many friends and family members as the shot clock goes off Ace Buckner not recognizing it to the dismay of Brad Brownell along the sideline But Ive got too many friends and family that are Steelers fans But Mike Tomlin is from the great state of Virginia And even though Im a Cowboy fan I root for Mike Tomlin So Im going with the Steelers right Even though they the Steelers faithful were very rude to my guy Mike Tomlin earlier this year And I would love to see him win a Super Bowl and then go take one of these other jobs What do you think its go to the Browns after they win the Super Bowl Turned it over in the back court Shrewberry Theres his dad Micah Shrewsberrys Irish have trailed most of the game Theyve turned it over 10 times And dad will take out his son And And one thing about Micah Shrewsberry he hes going to coach Braden harder than he does everyone else I was fortunate to be around coach Rusberry when he had a conversation with Jim Beheim about coaching your child And again coach Beheim gave him some some tips some wisdom And Michael Shrewberry absolutely coaches Braden as hard as he possibly can And the younger Shrewberry is on the way next year Finish at the other end by Justin Porter Clemsons lead has been stretched to nine here Porters got 14 shooting at five for seven Clemsons been hot in the half Kaylor Applause got Harelson a good look at a while Notre Dame His four made field goals were all early Applause Heres pass knocked away by Porter Finds its way to Kaylor who missed it Almost another broken basket for Brady Instead Clemson can get its first double figure lead of the game Applause On a back down Davidson Double team comes whips it out to Porter Godfreyys gotten the offensive rebound Went right over the top of Notre Dames Harlson Now Davidson he misses a three Another offensive rebound for Godfrey and he is fouled Menacing the backboard RJ Godfrey draws a foul against Harelson But when you look at the lineup of the Irish its a smaller lineup right now in comparison to what Clemson has on the floor And even though Tout is on the floor hes away from the basket defending Davidson which leaves RJ Goffrey on the interior with a much smaller defender trying to keep him off the offensive glass Backto back offensive rebounds for Godfrey to keep that possession alive Godfrey will take a seat Wall lead as well Welling back in the game but a Johnson and Porter gets free Shook in off a cut and Micah Shrewberry is furious and the inflamed Irish head coach takes a timeout Largest lead for Clemson Notre Dame right into the game Clemsons got its largest lead Michael Shrewsbury called a timeout And now his Notre Dame team has to hang it up and see what the rest of tonight brings Ace Butner gets hit with his first foul Largest lead for the Tigers Notre Dame has not scored in more than two minutes which similar to the first half when Jaylen Harlson goes to the bench Thats when Notre Dame struggles on the offensive end of the floor Only five points for the Irish in this second half Two more from Kar The put back pushed in Freshman out of Fisers Makes it 5041 Applause Clemson trying to go 40 Backto back years in the ACC Theyve never started 40 in a conference in backto back seasons Welling is fouled by Jai Thats going to be the fourth on Jai with 1335 to go One of Mike Trusberrys staff members is going to inform him thats for Jai and Notre Dame will get Carson Top off the bench late to replace him Applause Justin Porter takes a seat for Clemson Hunter back on the floor 34 Buckner in the air No good Applause in trying to push its way back into the game Led six2 early Clemson has led just about the whole way since Music Applause I young lineup on the floor here for Notre Dame along with Shrewberry and Toutton Shrewberry will drive it with four to shoot Find Kaylor kicks it Colerta clean look in and out rebounded by Kaylor on the glass again offensively Kaylors second chance will roll off and tout is held by Welling So a relentless energy and pursuit of the ball keeps possession for the Irish And you got to love the energy as you talked about the pursuit of going after the offensive rebound Serta gets a good look unable to get it to go but Kaylor comes back in Shot denied goes back at it unable to get it to go And Dennis Tower with another offensive rebound opportunity picking up the foul against just keeps trucking on the offensive glass Down by nine Serta window rebound Welling Great allaround game for Carter Welling tonight We got a foul way away from the play Going to get Kaylor on that one trying to keep Davidson from getting post position Third on Brady Kaylor and Harelson will return with 1233 to go Notre Dame down nine Applause Inbound is to Welling Three guards for Clemson right now Welling and Davidson Music Butner follows his own miss up The put back is there on the weak side Carter Welling into double figures and Carson T lost a shoe Brad Rundell encouraging his guys and loves the grit the toughness from his team Both these coaches talk to us about the toughness that they have within their roster They may not be the most talented team but they know that theyre going to get a fight from these guys each and every night Harlson fouled by Johnson And youve seen a lot of the league early already Fair to say Clemson from a talent level not in the top of the league but from a togetherness consistent level is as good as anybody in the league Thats very accurate The culture again youve got the longest tenure ACC coach on the sideline And to my recognition hes never won an ACC coach of the year which is a travesty But the fact that this guys been such a good coach for so long and never won an ACC coach of the year But Bradell is not a guy thats looking for credit Hes looking for results and hes been getting him from this program 87 and 33 over the last three plus seasons Buckner is floating No the trophy last year should have been split three ways between Pat Kelsey Jeff and Brownell These three teams dominated the league Great finish by Harelson and a free throw coming as Harlson back in the game Makes an instant impact and sent earlier this year Then went on to beat Georgia in the championship game in overtime of that one So all those wins Brad Rell thinking to himself keep on winning WVU Bostons got a lot of good wins already He came into the day with six wins in either quad one or two tied for the 10th most in D1 very very very early brackettology Joel Andardi says theyre looking like a six seed right now Theyve got a good resume This would be a quad one win on the road at Notre Dame by eight Yeah Notre Dame at the net 60 is a nice job by Kaylor coming over and blocking the jump shot And again thats not a small guy in Wayland who hes hes able to go up there and get that one Six rebounds and a block for Brady whos made a bunch of good plays today Little shot fake at three Oh Bradys feeling good right now You knew he was shooting that and it was a bad shot and hes probably going to Clemson knew he was shooting it too But he but he was feeling it and hes going to come out of the game Garrett Sandre on his way to the scores table now Michael Shrewsbury the first face he saw was going to be the next guy in the game Porter a game high 16 slicing through up for grabs and it stays with Clemson and he knows it Yes And hes going to get hes going to get a private conversation with coach Shrewberry And again this this is the life of a freshman The reality behind it youve been the guy your whole life right You can take any shot you want and then you come to you know Notre Dame Youre talking about one of the top eight winningest basketball programs in the history of the game Davidson a rattled three set up by Hunter and Clemsons lead is 11 again But you dont get to do what you want as a freshman This very very rare that thats the case And again Kaylor is going to be a really good player and learning his way around the college basketball Davidson rebounds the Harlson miss He just had the first bench points of the half for Clemson Remember Butner had all five of their bench points in the first half For a team that comes in averaging over 32 bench points per game which leads the ACC is simply about strength and numbers for the Tigers this year They beat you with their depth Guys triple down to the double Found Wallen Has not been great from three today Six in a 23 still lead by 11 and Porters got another steel Justin all the way for two more Clemson steals leader Justin Porters got seven in the two games this week and thats 11 turnovers for the Fighting Irish compared to only five for Clemson So Clemsons defense has been very disruptive throughout this game Haroldson pulls up for a three I tell you what this guy is an elite rebounder The numbers dont tell the story Porter getting a hand in the passing lane and then tracking it down Shrewsbury not adding insult to injury by fouling Porter after the steel And Justin Porter up to 18 points You say the numbers dont tell a story for Tout No And hes the leading rebounder in division one active rebounder Thats a good number But its a great number but the number doesnt show how he goes and gets him If you go back and look at that rebound his back is to the basket Hes avoiding trying to I mean hes trying to go to the basket Hes getting fouled but hes grabbing it with one hand and covering it Being the leading rebounder doesnt show the way that he goes after it Hes 68 Hes a big guy Hes not 611 Hes not 7 ft He often does especially in this league now have to go against bigger players but hes still averaging close to 11 rebounds per game The third leading assist man about two a game seven points 10 and a half rebounds Hit one free throw and its a 12point Clemson lead with 840 to go Davidson with a slow motion drive into Tout One footer is short Tals physicality forced Davidson into a fall away shot Thats not the toughest that Brad Brownell is looking for Notre Dame minus three on the glass Theyve only lost the rebounding battle twice Those were in losses to Kansas and Houston Kaylor gets hugged up So when I say numbers dont tell the story this counts as one It doesnt even count as a rebound But look at that That is elite effort timing athleticism So again now take it back Do numbers tell the story He doesnt get a rebound for that because he gets fouled He will he got the rebound and then he got a foul No no no no They called the foul on that I dont know if he gets the rebound for that one If only there was some way we could find out Decept our imagination Taylor misses the front end of the one and one They thought transferring up from Northern Arizona that that rebounding skill would remain as Johnson misses a three Michael Shrewsbury said rebounding translates at every level and it has from the Big Sky to the ACC It really does Thats one of the things that Michael Shrewsbury with his NBA experience of course spending time with the Boston Celtics thats one of the main things that they talk about at the NBA level Rebounding transcends the level youre playing If you have the desire to go get it you often will And of course Tout has that And he also has a couple buckets Seven and 10 right now A block and a steal for Tout 11th time in 16 games hes got 10 rebounds Johnson passes up an open three Hunter finds Godfrey who scores it Hes got 12 points on four of five shooting from the field I love the way Dylan Hunters played throughout this game especially when hes attacking the basket dropping off those pocket passes to his big guys who are willing recipients And Godfrey able to put that one in for two under the leading assist to turnover ratio in Clemson history Has a couple of assists zero turnovers tonight Ives for three and Rainbow will go And Dylan Hunter upset with his teammate for not switching out on that one and allowing Ims to get an open look when he got hit with the screen In his 73rd career game I has a careerhigh 13 points Godfrey sets up Porter way too strong and sort of got pushed by Johnson I think Coington realized he couldnt just call that out of bounds So more free throws coming for Notre Dame trying to hang around with Clemson up nine Clemson in control and the guy thats controlling the pace is Dylan Hunter dropping the some of the athletic ability that is shown in those meets Unreal Its uh among the leading sports for people at home going Oh my god how did they do that Yes exactly The training the repetition that it takes because the average unfortunately did not happen The average person cant do what they do Cal by the way national runners up a couple of years ago part of that beat as well Thats after this game 6 and a half or so to go Sevenpoint lead for Clemson Porters had a big scoring night Harelson has shot it well for Notre Dame Tigers looking for a quad one win on the road and a 40 start to the ACC with three road games Brad Brownells going to take a timeout Well it was a Under six to play Porter with 18 Godfrey behind him with 14 I can get it to go And Godfrey is going to be called for a foul The tug on Tout first on God And once again its because of the effort with Tout going after every shot that goes up RJ Godfrey whos as strong as anyone in the ACC still having his hands full dealing with tout on the offensive glass Tout is three for six all off the glass Applause Hes getting more comfortable Well that one definitely looks better than the first one throughout the day That just really caught me off guard I I thought it slipped but now that hes taken his eighth free throw attempt of the game you recognize that is his style And now five of eight increasing the percentage for the Fighting Irish who have been struggling from the line not just today but throughout this entire season First time Touts hit both free throws tonight as four trips to the line Theyre hanging around the Fighting Irish down by just seven Knocked away Tout tries to CALL TIMEOUT IN THE AIR and he got it Carson Tout with a takeaway and the aerial timeout and theyve gotten the ball after a Carson Tout steel and timeout And Notre Dame no stranger to deficits and being able to come back from those deficits Theyve done it twice this season already So when thinking of double digit deficits so this is a team that is more than capable especially on their home floor of pulling off a elite comeback I pass up the shot Knocked away Porter in the cookie jar again He gets fouled hard by Shrewberry Theyre going to go over and review this one Is Barnett already giving the signal Was called the comet foul The officials will see if this And often times what comes into play is the result And thats I think theres a strong chance that this one gets upgraded to a flagrant one And when you consider of course you cant measure intent Bill Coington is at the mic but not going to Oh there he is We have a common foul on Black 11 reviewing for a potential upgrade All right Bill Coington Isaac Barnett Anthony Eids Remember the call on the floor is a common foul So you have Shrewsbury coming in with what would be considered a windup And Im not sure that they will deem that as necessary or a basketball play So watch the right arm of Shrewberry as he goes I do believe this will be upgraded to a flagrant one And again it is a basketball play Hes trying to get to the ball and knock it away but because of the contact and the result this most likely is upgraded to a flagrant one Part of the flagrant one criteria can be an excessive or unnecessary act Now he doesnt come all the way down Thats only because his arm hits Porters shoulder and bounces back up But the body also runs directly into Porter knocking him out of bounds I think that will be the excessive and unnecessary part Also the push or hold from behind And again Shrewberry is is trailing Porter on that possession So I do believe this will be upgraded to a flagrant one Music After review well call it flagrant foul Two shots Clemson ball on the end line 20 seconds from the shot clock Anthony Eids uh just filled that in a little bust He said swinging a follow through defenseless player So flaker one as you imagine it would be upgraded Cory its going to be two free throws for Porter and Clemson will retain possession from there But how about the momentum shift Notre Dame with the basketball down seven and an opportunity should get it to five even four which would be as low as theyve had it throughout this game But another steal the fourth of the game for Porter as he makes the two free throws to get to 20 points on the evening and more importantly pushes a lead back out to nine Clemson with the basketball and opportunity to get it back to double figures Hit his season high 21 a week ago at Pit Hes got 20 today and in the interceding period just seven points Wednesday but a careerhigh four steals against SMU So three terrific allaround games in a row in the last eight days for Justin Porter And hes tied that careerhigh four steals still with five minutes remaining here in this contest Porter came to Clemson out of Middle Tennessee State Shawn Dixon one of the Clemson assistants knew him formerly at Middle Tennessee And Justin Porter has really fit his way into the system with his energy level his activity defensively He can make shots 37 from three into the night Two more today Two for six Under five to play Clemson has led the entire half Porter inside on Shrewsbury Drops it off for Willing Its bobbled and its going to be off of Notre Dame with six to shoot But that was great action offensively by Clemson Not only do you use up 24 seconds on the shot clock but also the ball moves from side to side forcing Notre Dame to guard Constant motion Runner into Godfrey Hes going to go at Tout This has been a fun matchup to watch Godfrey got it on the rim Rebounded by Ims IMS on the floor with Serta Kaylor Shrewberry and Tow Havent seen Harelson since the 9minute mark I short from three and Tout was all over Welling who hit the deck Carson Tout will pick up his second and Tal who forces so much physicality this time He picks up the foul and you can see that great call as hes get the left arm wrapped around I cant even tell who that was in the white jersey was arguing that he was being held first but the officials didnt agree Its the fifth foul on Notre Dame And Jaylen Harlsons in the game for the first time in about 5 minutes Under four to play Clemson by nine in search of three road wins in its first four ACC games Double team Welling dribbles away from it Three to shoot here Godfrey didnt realize it He finds Porter whos fouled with a second to go They found it just in the nick of time Godfreys a little hobbled there might bang blue painted area on the floor and they have not been able to do that It is a 304 advantage for Clemson and points in the paint throughout this game And when you look at this Clemson team it is a more experienced group than what youre seeing with Notre Dame whos playing a lot of young players and that physicality often times comes to experience And that was the first line that Micah Shrewsbury told his team is theres no substitute for experience Another turnover and another steal for Porter A careerhigh fifth Hes got 24 Justin Porter in complete command And Clemsons lead is 13 Harlson spinning and winning for two And thats the third turn of the game for Braden Shrewsbury And a couple of them have just been not been able to catch the basketball as he is subbed out by Kaylor And it has not been Braden Shrewsberrys night Only five points two of seven from the field And youre talking about a guy who comes in averaging close to 12 points per game at 21 Saturday at Cal The game before that he did not score at Stanford So a real roller coaster start to the conference for him Wild pass Porter collects it Porter guarded by Ives Porter steps back Long two is buried Justin Porter unconscious with 26 now And this is uncharacteristic as to what weve seen from the Clemson Tigers throughout this year Rarely do they have a 20point score of one guy who really carries the offense But Justin Porter has been just that Another steel Uhoh Up top GODFREY He got it back from Porter A delicious again you know players have he he mentioned the Georgia game where youve got three to four players on the Clemson ro roster from the state of Georgia Well now you have coaches from Indiana when you consider Donlin as well as Brad Barnell and this is a homecoming for them a place where theyve struggled throughout their tenure at Clemson And so a rewarding what should be win for the Tigers with 206 remaining now up 15 and coach Donland up with coach Brownell Both guys up front of the bench making sure they finish this one off Yeah they both got family members and friends behind the bench Brad Brownell said My familys from the other side of the state but Ill still have some folks here tonight You mentioned building hes only won in once Yeah And he his sisters here We were on the elevator together coming to the game and so he told me his sister would be coming down and then so I see people on the elevator with Clemson gear on and I looked at her and I said You wouldnt happen to be Brads sister would you And she was just so surprised They favor I could tell Yes Brad Brown graduate of Depal where Michael Shrewsbury coached a decade later Mhm Porter Applause Hunter end of the shot clock gets it to Welling who banks in a three So So really what it is its this end of the floor Thats it You notice we havent really had much bank action going on outside of a couple of tout free throws on the left side But the bank has been open to our right throughout this game Its the right bank and as Serta buries a three on the other side Notre Dame is going to come up short here A week off in between their devastating loss at Cal See how they would respond Well I think the bigger issue with this one is not necessarily about the Notre Dame response as it is the opponent And you got to give the Tigers the T the Irish with the basketball down seven Opportunity to cut into the lead Get it to five maybe even four with a three They turn it over The flagrant one foul and the the lead balloons for the Tigers ever since Clemson has won six straight by an average of just 48 points per game Brad Banell said I dont know if were going to have a lot of blowout wins this year as tight as the league is and this was not a blowout the whole way but Clemson has stretched its lead out little by little here in the second half and its going to be a comfortable final margin of victory Mark Zachary getting some minutes here at the end of the game The converted football player misses a layup and thats going to do it Clemson with the ball Clemson will end the game plus two on the glass plus eight in the turnover column and plus 15 the only column that matters So for the first time the Clemson Tigers start 4 and0 in conference play in backtoback years They stretch their conference road win streak to 11 the second longest in the country behind only Houston
