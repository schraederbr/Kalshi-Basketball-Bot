And McCrae with a strong shoe game wearing six for Florida State Hes got the ball now He is third in the ACC in assists behind Booby Miller and Miamiys Trey Donaldson Florida State shaking up its starting lineup Luke Clouts getting some fresh bases in there that dont normally start Here is McCrae looking for room underneath and he hoists hoist that one up over JJ Starling for the quick two Starting lineups for Syracuse Nathan George starting to find his groove of late 14 points five assists over his last five JJ Stling had one of his best games of the season and we mentioned Donnie Freeman His return has opened things up Thats Nick Kings and thats what he does 45 for three at Oregon State last year Absolutely right Nice plays designed for a flare screen for Kings to come off Gets his feet set fires away Hes been up and down in a Syracuse jersey but when he gets going it can really pull McCrae pulls the trigger Hes got all five early on for Florida State a 30 threepoint shooter on the season And he just needs to be serviceable out there Hes going to attack the rim first If you get that defense to come out and commit to you defensively it gives you that much more space Really nice start so far for McCrae Florida State takes a lot of threes Theyve attempted the most in the ACC Donnie Freemans first attempt doesnt go Battle for the rebound Its a mere maluke and he is called for a traveling violation Luke LZ who was on that 2012 Florida State ACC championship team with Bernard James and Michael Snare first year head coach replacing the legend of Leonard Hamilton and TOE came from the NBA Very much an NBA approach in how this team functions Absolutely Theyre trying to play wide open move the basketball play quickly Very much in the same vein as what the NBA teams that he worked for do Sacramento Kings and the Golden State Warriors Just a terrific basketball mind And as he continues to grow into this college basketball profession theres going to be some bumps and bruises but I like the way theyre playing early Tomas Basong attacking the rim Looked like a lot of ball Im going to be honest with you Anish And Im glad you said Tomas Hes been called Tom We asked him directly at practice What do you want to be called And there was about a fiveminute back and forth where the European politeness showed up He is from France and he said you can call me whatever you want Thomas toas Finally we said what do you want to be called And he said after long consideration Tomas So Tomas Bon Hes got a giant future That three doesnt go for Kobe McGee whos come in on a heater He had been 10 for his last 22 from deep Now Nate George the Georgia Tech transfer Freeman double team cheering turns it over Here comes Bassan leading the break and lays it in And Florida State off to a fast start A big difference from their game against NC State on Saturday where they lost by 44 And the reason he went with this starting unit he said it in the shoot around this morning This is the team that gave me the most effort against NC cheering State Tomomasz Bass led Florida State in scoring with 14 and he said thats not why I started him Its because he got out of the passing lanes He gives me every ounce of his ability and whenever your ability also has a 73 wingspan those things cheering help Stling miss fires coming off a 19point game on seven of 11 shooting They have the win against Pit on Saturday cheering Al McCrae spent two years at Jacksonville started at Wake to Chanty Wiggins the Clemson transfer Wasnt long ago just two games ago Florida State went toetotoe with Duke for 40 minutes And Wiggins a big reason why Absolutely Hes a guy at 610 can step out and knock down shots And over his last three games starting to find his rhythm cheering during conference play shooting 38 over those three games Thats something hes capable of George the three cheering to stem a 90 Florida State run About Nate George send the man to the deck Big time shot McCrae picked up the dribble cheering and applause Now Bass got the step on Freeman Denied by Kyle Syracuse among the national leaders in block shots Freeman cant finish at the rim Maloo turns cheering it over on the rebound Stalling a chance for a threepoint play and thats a killer if youre Florida State Maloo Good effort Get back in transition Get the rebound You have to be careful The Syracuse guards will come back And nice job JJ Styley just understanding the rhythm of how this game starting to be played A veteran guy scored a thousand points in a Syracuse jersey Theres two more One shot You asked a great question about JJ Starling Anishh to Red Autry You know whats different about it Well he doesnt have to be the all the time guy this year right This roster is very talented They did a terrific job putting these guys together They fit well and you can see it Maybe his production is down but he can focus on some of those other things You called Syracuse Pit on Saturday as Steam drops it in the D2 transfer from Florida Southern and Stling was efficient He didnt force a shot and Brett Autry said with this team he doesnt need to be efficient He thought what we saw on Saturday was the best version of JJ Starling This starting unit for Florida State has played well here early giving the team the energy lift theyve needed as Freeman drops it in his first two Underrated part of of Donnie Freemans game A cutter off the ball You see it right there His guy turns He sees the back of his defenders head You cut to the rim and Nate George and these guards for Syracuse excellent passers Theres George with the steel He led the ACC in assists last year Hes got numbers and Freeman plays above cheering the rim How fast is Donnie Freeman in the open floor Just running rimto rim Terrific pass And this is what makes me optimistic about this Syracuse team They can really get out and go Bang Gets it over the elite shot blocker William Kyle Here comes Starling Syracuse looking to push cheering George from Freeman Too strong Offensive rebound Kyle he backs down steam finds it cutting Clayman who scored six in a row for Syracuse And I would love to harp on Donnie Freeman being a good cutter Thats poor defense on the other side of the ball Florida State you cant lose where your guys at Thats a good call Nate George pulling him down Hey weve got a good game These guys going up and down Nate George they get a steal They can take off and go Anishh And Im just gonna keep talking music and I apologize because this is where were at My man gets a steal Hes off in transition Were just gonna throw it up And Donnie Freeman hes going to bring us to commercial laughter Amen America So stand up if you want a chance to win a free Pizza ACC Network basketball is presented by Tro Price We present Donnie Freeman Donnie Freemans been money I I mean as a cutter away from the basket out to transition Throw it up and he knows how to finish And nice pass Willie Kyle the third I Ive been really music impressed with his skill set too Not just a leaper not just a dunker not just a shot blocker Hes got some ball skills too Uh terrific pass out of the post But Donnie Freeman hes such his cerebral approach to the offensive music end of the floor has really opened up this Syracuse offense He missed nine games with a right foot injury had injury issues last year where he missed 19 games with a broken bone in his right foot since coming back which was the start of conference play against Clemson averaging 22 a game at 27 and the road win at Georgia Tech music 22 over the weekend against Pit And Gre Autry told us before the Pit game that second half of the Clemson game he started to really you could see his shoulders relax He got into the game he was selective about his shots but you got to guard that guy Sean Cy Wiggins with his second three And this is a Florida State team They live by the three They die by the three And its on both ends of the floor Absolutely right And heres the thing They need to guard a little bit better out on the perimeter Sure But if they rebound the ball thats the biggest thing If they finish possessions and take off running they can find some looks too because theyre at their best playing against the defensive flux Starling fouled in the corner by Somerville Florida State leads the ACC in threepointers attempted Third in threepointers made Here is where the disconnect begins But not a great threepoint shooting team Only 32 as a team which is second worst only behind BC in the ACC But this is the style that Luke LS wants to play at Florida State This is his version Its the NBA stamp So cheering what he is doing with this team this year is telling everybody out there were going to play like NBA teams do Were going to play fast Were going to shoot threes Were going to rely on spacing And hes trying to put that in as a culture setter in year one What a three for the corner Tyler Betsy knocked down three triples on Saturday I mean Nate George what a pass on the inbounds set He fired that like a fast ball to the opposite corner Tyler Betsy hes a shooter We all know that And Nate George the vision the ability to get it there through all those hands Impressive Somerville took a little contact knocks down the three America East Rookie of the Year last year at UMass LOL He has been the nulls most consistent threepoint shooter this year Well lets say this too Uh maybe Florida State needs to play more basketball games in football arenas cheering Away from Excuse me Yeah I mean moving the basketball Martin Somerville hes got this in his game The lefty models his game a little bit after off of James Harden Kind of the same cadence same pace doesnt have the same size but that lefty off the bounce You can see some of those similarities Somerville gets free wide open in and out Florida State had been eight of 10 and four or five from three before that miss Somerville in the passing lane Thats what Florida State does well Nine plus steals per game and Steen on cleanup duty now one rebound shy of 800 for his career Hey Florida State they they were jarred loose a little bit against NC State coming out with some different effort And heres the thing you got to get back if youre Syracuse Four guys in the paint and transition offense for Florida State or the Orange Benson open and the Cincinnati transfer knocks down his second three Hes now five for his last six from deep Florida State in a loss Saturday at NC State or home to NC State 5 for 23 from three Theyve already knocked down four Le Jones that looked good Goes off the back iron Akir Suare the rebound And here comes Carmelos kid Ken Anthony I love how Florida States loading to the ball here early Theyre switching everything out on the perimeter They can do that with this lineup Steam switchable on the defensive end of the floor Look how theyre flooding to the basketball But these are opportunities for the future Anonys three not there Battle for the rebound to Jones Jones transfer from St Bonaventure About 3 hours from here in Olean New York cheering 70 mi south of Buffalo Ive heard Oleans a vacation destination From who Mike Cory Anthony splits the D Where have we seen that before Absolutely I love it The low gather underneath the defense hands Thats something you work on And Florida States going to grab a timeout What a terrific move by this young man Hes learning Hes developing Thats part of his deal Hes not all the way there yet but hes getting there And little moves like this they tell the story K music Anthony hes got talent Hes trying to get Cuse back in it brought to you by science One two three Number two is number three ACC mens basketball is presented by Troll Price Invest with confidence Brad Johnson played football and basketball at Florida State So did Charlie Ward Heisman Trophy winner in football Then went on to a long NBA career Played with the New York Knicks Jim Brown played football basketball played lacrosse He was one of the great lacrosse players of all time Donovan McNab was on the basketball team as well when he started as the quarterback for the football team And we bring that up because weve got a couple of multisport athletes early enrolles now football players playing basketball Jason Lopez a fourstar wide receiver for Florida State Calvin Russell fivestar wide receiver the biggest recruit Syracuse has had in a quarter century now part of the basketball team Wheres the time to do homework Anish Im not going there laughter I didnt have time playing one sport Well in their defense I went to school here You get away with not doing homework Thats not true There are some majors where they tell you your grades dont count I had one of them as Somerville knocks down the three Hey Martin Somervilles off to a good start Moving without the basketball How about FSU now going elongated two3 zone Those bottom wings getting out there far so they can get to the shooters Somerville in his last game did not make a three for the first time in his career Need to find some way to penetrate cheering this zone Get in the middle get to the baseline force some rotations Thats tough Not sure I like the offensive possession though And those are the shots Red Autry told us that JJ Sterling doesnt need to take anymore Well with Somerville catch release no good A rebound snagged by Sadi White another freshman Well he needed to take that one There wasnt much time on the shot clock but youre right I I mean he needs to be a little bit more selective and the makeup of this team has allowed him to be but I love the way Florida States pushing this basketball right now This is how Luke LS wants it to look Tempo spacing flow Van blocked Thats Suare the Georgia Tech transfer Anthony spearheads the break gets tied up and fouled cheering And a good defensive possession by Syracuse staying in front of the ball Sadique White gets beat Help is on the way by the name of Suare Takes off running A foul on McCrae his first Thats the third team foul cheering Florida State stays in the zone Bens knocked out a couple of triples Another offensive rebound Sadique right the turnaround Not there cheering Suare acted down low but Jones able to find the carum McCrae spin cycles right over Betsy Too strong Is Suare active or what when hes in the game He absolutely has been especially on the offensive glass but hes always around in a perfect backup cheering center Hes going to give you big time energy Cant just be this guy Willie Kyle who comes in and gives you great minutes Sure but you got to give them breaks at points But I love the energy right now for Florida State Up two on the road Tough place to play Good crowd here tonight And theyve come out setting the pace with the intention of attacking Syracuse on the glass Florida State went through a mini gauntlet went on the road to UNCC Duke at home NC State at home The schedule a big reason theyre 0 and three in league play as Kyan Anthony swivels to the basket Hes really good at that Got a mismatch out on the perimeter A Maloo hes got talent Hes athletic Hes about 7 feet tall but he gets stuck sometimes on a guard and its difficult for him Jones on the drive beats White We were at Florida State shootaround and there seemed to be a fear when Kyle is in the game helping on drivers because Kyle is a human pogo stick who can jump out of the gym and they didnt want to give Syracuse any dunks Absolutely right Hes a vertical spacer People talk about hey can you space the floor out Theres two ways to do that As a shooter on the perimeter or if you can throw it to the moon to Willie Kyle and he can finish for you Shot clock at three at two Betss cheering got to put it up Hes blocked by Jones And the Florida State bench applauds the defensive effort The Seinals have come to the dome Theyre shooting it 11 of 20 from the field Five of nine from three Theyve got a music twopoint lead This is the next The Miami Hurricanes at home to play for a championship Touchdown Indiana Electric Its what every little kid dreams of The CFP National

Russell Wonder how long its going to take him to get used to the weather You never quite do laughter Guess not But I hear you Football like basketball is played indoors Sure Great point cheering I like this move right here by Syracuse Youre struggling a little bit with energy How can you turn it up a little bit Come out fullourt press Doesnt have to be anything crazy A little manto man just to turn up the intensity and be intentional about how youre playing And we got a foul on Sadi White Number one on a freshman Say this about Sadique White This freshman really talented one of the most athletic players in the country out of Charlotte North Carolina Theres a lot of his physical traits which if youre familiar with Syracuse history you say Hakee Warick Absolutely And Hakee Warick turned into a first team allAmerican and a conference player of the year Were not saying Sadique White is there yet If you look at where they were as freshman the numbers are very comparable Warick as a sophomore took a massive leap and at the end of his sophomore year had the block in the championship game against Kansas Biggest play in the history of the program You watch Sadique Whites highlight reel from high school Oh its its silly Shots dunking on people He catches a lot of bodies Anthony over Steen Rebound tap back to Steen Hes north of 800 career rebounds today On the drive McGee The tap in by Steen Waved off Really nice job Kobe McGee Youre playing fast in transition Quick shot fake You can attack the cup They get the foul on Sadique White on the first try like Kobe McGee transfers over from Drexel averaged 14 a game there Just a quality score coming down at Tallahassee and hes come on of late 13 points per game over his last three We remind you tomorrow on ACCNA basketball triple header on the mens side Pit and Georgia Tech start us off at 7 Eastern Then number 14 North Carolina we got Caleb Wilson We got the womens basketball promo Im reading the wrong promo here Its Louisville Notre Dame Virginia Duke And then tomorrow we do have a triple cheering header Georgia Tech Pit UNCC Stanford Duke and Cal And here comes Florida State still in attack mode One thing Luke L was talking about we have to be better on the glass One thing you cannot give up a free throw box out That will drive a coach crazy So McGee back to the line cheering You mentioned he was a Drexel transfer His forte there was the threepoint shot 44 last year And over these three ACC games hes found his stroke from the outside Youll see you know Florida State so far this game really attacking the rim Syracuse doesnt foul much This is a team that plays pretty strong steady Theyre ahead of the play today so far cheering Florida State has been able to get to the cup a little bit too much Im sure for Red Autrys liking but Luke LS has to love the energy that his teams coming out with He felt that was lacking on Saturday in the 44 loss to NC State LS looking to get his first ACC win as head coach You know what I love about what Florida State is doing right now is theyre changing defenses almost every time up the floor What its causing Syracuse to do is sit and think about it and theyre trying to get to their spot and then theyre taking tough shots at the end of the clock Yeah if youre Florida State youre going to give that up every time Thats Donnie Freeman with three on the shot clock having no choice but to do it himself And at the other end McGee in the corner for three The last thing you want to do is give a shooter a couple of looks at the free throw line to get comfortable for Saduk White Couldnt corral the pass Now McCrae and his Florida State debut McCrae set a school record with 17 cheering assists Tried to do it himself there Stalling Freeman wants it over Steam McCrae slams on the brakes Florida State plays at one of the fastest paces in all of Division One A pressure on defense Theyll turn you over McCrae stripped gets it back Still plenty of time Song got to step on White He got a hand on it Now Sterling Stling takes it all the way and lays it in With the basketball in his hands theres not many as fast as JJ Stling in transition He is a blur getting downhill in the open floor He admitted after the game Saturday that up until that Pittsburgh game he wasnt himself this season but he had 19 in that game Meanwhile Kobe McGee stays hot Thats his second three He is now 12 for his last 26 from three And we get a whistle down low Kobe McGees coming off screens ready to go And if youre a defender you you cant go underneath the screen on a shooter Thats just tough Were going to take another look at it right here Anish if youre guarding him you cannot go underneath that screen Sadique White thats a freshman mistake right there You go underneath and Kobe McGee a guy who is known for knocking down shots gets an easy look One knocked back as George tried to inbound it Chanty Wiggins all 610 guarding the inbounder Not yet Kyle double team quickly looking for help Stling machetes through the D Rejected by Hoo George has the room out NOT UNDERNEATH Got his man in the air Got fouled before the shot cheering They get Wiggins Its his second here Maluke Just outstanding Look at the help side 12 coming over Hes got good bounce And Luke LS wanted effort Well hes getting it Foul call on Chanty Wiggins number seven there for leaving his feet early And if youre the primary defender just square him up and let that guy come over to help Luke one of two holdovers from the Leonard Hamilton team last year He and AJ Swinton William Kyle cheering gets the two Its a fourpoint game We told you Florida State a team that lives by the three dies by the three In the first half theyve knocked down seven of their 11 threepoint attempts cheering and applause really getting a lot of high quality looks changing sides of the floor consistently Been really impressed with how aggressive theyve been getting into the paint to try to create for their teammates Somerville gets some space Now you got to go George wants to push before that zone can set up and he finds a wingman and Betsy And thats just terrific defense into offense You run the floor Tyler Betsy understands his role Get to that corner and let the best passing point guard in the ACC Get busy Five helpers for George Another turnover Betsys knocked down three triples Hes had the hot hand Stling shot fake Drives the up and under Yes And Syracuse takes the lead cheering and a timeout by Luke LZ Syracuse is at their best when theyre playing quick Theyre getting stops and theyre in the open floor Just a terrific job getting out and running Run the floor Tyler Betsy Nate George hell find you That shot is butter And on the other side JJ music Stland Weve seen this a time or two havent we Anish An up and under Not Jay Biliss way the court of Syracuse various Hes got three superiors cheering Its good to go All right Brotherhood music tomorrow on ACCN Pit goes to Georgia Tech UNCC and Duke both out music west Heels at Stanford Blue Devils at Cal All that Wednesday Triple header including a little ACC after dark on ACCN Syracuse seven unanswered and couple of turnovers by Florida State have triggered the Syracuse transition game The zone by Florida State gave Syracuse a little trouble Its easier to score when the zone cant set up Absolutely right And music thats when Syracuse was at their best against Pit in their last contest on Saturday This is a team that can function in transition because they have so many different ball hand ball handlers in the open floor The problem is is when Florida State has gotten back in that zone its gotten Cus back on their heels a little bit Get stops get out and run and you can find some easy buckets When Red Audrey took over as head coach one of his subtle changes from his predecessor was to play more mantoman defense Syracuse predominantly a mantoman team when theyre on defense but Florida State showing some zone tonight Heres McCrae working on George gets the step Kyle may have gotten a piece He came in third nationally in block shots tops in the ACC Betsy he check Oh yes cheering His fourth three of the half He had three in the win Saturday at pit And its all spearheaded by my man Willie Kyle the third getting up and blocking a shot above the padding Unbelievable athleticism A prey to Steen Gives it up Bung Steen juggled it Shot clock at five Jones over Betsy and that puts an end to a 100 Syracuse run Betsy again cheering in and out That would have been number five Thats a quality look Was it early in the clock Sure But youre willing to live with those And how about Syracuse giving Florida State a taste of their own medicine switching defenses But now youve got to run Now you got to get out and go Florida State able to get back defensively George slicing through the defense but traveled Just an unbelievable defensive possession in the middle of the zone by Will Look how high he gets here Anish throw it to the moon That is unbelievable And it leads to this transition offense Tyler Betsy laughter Tyler Betsy comes in the trail spot and knocks it through My man Ron Ays is talking trash to me while Im trying to call the game Roger Or Roger excuse me Well Ron Ron Groover Roger Ayes I apologize Was he giving you grief about your shoes No He said that one looked like one of mine from three I mean just really good play so far and good defensive possession by Cuse Now some Florida State turnovers of late here have thwarted some of their momentum cheering We saw a week ago Roger Harris give out one of the best technical fouls youll ever see It was Will Wade the NC State coach waved him off Was it deserved Debatable Debatable And Roger came right past our broadcast position and said thats for waving off a what three decade plus ACC head official Donnie Freeman knocks down to three Now Syracuse heating up from the outside Theyre seven of 18 and Florida State in its previous two games allowed 33 combined threes with opponents shooting better than 51 Good job moving the basketball Last possession here for Florida State Theyre going to hold for one more quick ball screen You have shooters on the weak side Get your guys in an advantage cheering About a sixsecond differential McCrae calling for the pick from deep back iron Follows a shot McCrae to Steam Final tick Sterling lets it fly off the backboard No good The sophomore transfer from Cincinnati Fourth made threes in the opening 20 for Syracuse Hell start the second half on the bench Both teams come out with their original starting fives applause Kings with a corner three and rattles in and out The rebound by Kobe McGee He knocked down a couple of threes in that first half McCraes the engine Started his career at Wake Forest Two years at Jacksonville third in the ACC in assists Plenty of room Three doesnt go Offensive rebound to Luke comes to George Syracuse looking to push They had number for Kyle and he crashes down hard Defensive stop Florida State you got to get back But Willie Kyle he gets out in transition You get it Tough play I think he banged his knee on the hardwood Were going to go take Oh excuse me Theyre going to call it on the on the floor Not a shooting foul On the pass Second half Foul is going to be on Florida State And a chance for a threepoint play for Syracuse Uh just really good use of the of Nate Georges eyes Look at him Hes looking off the defender looking off Its right there in front of you And Donnie Freeman tough finish over the top of Aaliier Maloo Uh just really good Look hes looking off playing the game with his eyes Thats a step ahead and wed expect nothing less Seven assists for him on the board 13 points for Freeman cheering MCCRAE PICKED UP A FOUL ON the Kyle attempt The other foul was on Maluke Syracuse again trying to run Its knocked away by McGee Stling passed up the three cheering Instead its Kyle whos got that insane vertical jump How nice is the stats guy for Syracuse Because that could go one of two ways Thats either an offensive rebound or its an assist And another turnover for Florida State A turnover started wearing its ugly head for the Seminals late in that first half Its now continued How about nice shot fake JJ Stling Im calling it a pass Anish Derek Wittenberg agrees friendly statistician here at Syracuse They give Starling the assist George cheering to Kyle and the Thunder Syracuse starting to figure out Florida States two3 zone Just a really nice job getting the ball into the middle to your best passer Quick look away Really Kyle the Third knows how to finish Seven assists for Nathan George Wiggins had a couple of threes in that opening half McCrae to Ste McGee puts it on the floor The runner good High skill level there by Kobe McGee High off the glass Look at George just looking to push Kyle wanted Freeman on the back door cut A turnover cheering Nice ball movement Syracuse starting to understand We get to the middle of the zone and Nate George just manipulating the defense William Kyle like if hes within 10 ft of the rim hes hanging from iron I mean just an unbelievable athlete McGee no good Bon batted away A fl foul on the floor against Syracuse Syracuse fans arent going to like this call but I I actually do like that call Nate Kings wrapped around boxing out Tough look Well take another look at it here Keep an eye on the off arm of Kings right His right arm is wrapped around Tomas Bone And it is Tomas For the Florida State fans wondering hey wasnt it Tomas We got a foul on the shot by McGee And that is on George his second cheering Bas told us at practice today He prefers Tomas At first he said you know what Thomas Tomas Tomas I dont care And we said well we care What do you want to be called And finally he said you know what Tomas cheering I said Tomas I said Im Im Im willing to die on this hill that its Tomas cheering Hey Kobe McGees had a good game so far He has Hes had a good little run the last three games Absolutely Hes played really really well As the competition level has gone up hes gotten better I like his game Hes got good size He shoots a nice ball He lets the game come to him too Hes not a guy thats going to force the issue Feeling himself a little bit right now Gets three free throws And this is kind of what got him loose in the first half the trip to the foul line and then the game started to come a lot easier Shot making started to fall Last thing you want to do again Nich let a shooter get to the foul line and test it out McGee came in averaging 13 a game in Florida States three ACC games Hes got 13 tonight and hes been shooting it well from three in that stretch as well Stling back to George defended by McCrae George theres the walk and thats what terrified Florida State at shootout Unbelievable Somebody foul somebody so I can see it again Steam Theres the foul Its going to be a foul on Syracuse But I got to go back and look at this one again Come off the ball screen No help Throw it to the moon Anish Kin at the rim He is eye level Such an impressive athlete This guy will big time big time high jumper High school last year Nothing against Eddie Lanin who was the center Lamin led the team with 16 blocks Kyle came into the game with 46 Syracuse wanted to get more athletic Willie Kyles a good place to start Steen at the free throw line misses And you know the thing too Willie Kyle didnt fit UCLA They play a slower methodical pace under Mick Cronin here for Syracuse Hes found a home Tough move Stalling on the baseline drive and theyve steamed the goend before the free throw Syracuse 5447 Craig turns it over Freeman to George The three is good cheering And Syracuse has opened up a 10point lead that matches its largest of the game Luke Lou needs a timeout And its not just Donnie Freemans ability to score Its his ability to handle it in the open floor Draw two Hit Nate George Return the favor Hes been passing to you all game Ladies and gentlemen please welcome Syracuse University It worked Come on cheering Nice screaming cheering and my man William Kyle III third He doesnt score all that many but when he does theyre loud A quick easy bucket here And his ability to affect the game on the defensive end of the floor This was in the first half Look how high Anish he music gets off the floor The apex of his jump He can take a quarter off the top of the backboard And in the second half hes just found ways around the rim to be effective So quick off two feet Long wingspan If you throw it within 10 feet of the rim my man will finish the music rest of the job He is just an unreal athlete His hand was about halfway up the backboard on the block shot Higher than that I mean my goodness Yeah This was a kid who came over from UCLA didnt play a whole lot last year but two years ago the Summit League defensive player of the year at South Dakota State and he offers athleticism on both ends of the floor 69 pogo stick out of Belleview Nebraska Tries to dunk on everybody your mama included Jake Jones turns faces for the offensive rebound and draws the foul Thats where Florida State got rhythm in the first half on the offensive glass And whenever you decide to go zone coming out of a timeout you have to remind your guys that when the shot goes up you have to find a body A lot easier to rebound when youre playing mantoman defense because you dont have to turn around you know where your guys at Youre in zone Go find somebody hit and get But Tomas Bong hes done a nice job today attacking the offensive glass being around the rim I love this young freshmans future 72 wingspan Does a lot of really good things on the I got him at 74 to Oh I I cut him short 68 Frenchman He scored in double figures in three of his previous five up 14 a careerhigh last time out against NC State Kings It doesnt go Steen is there Now Somerville And again you see Florida State changing defensive pressures Right Full work Get back to his zone Little bit of man Depends on that time down the floor trying to rig the game up a little bit Left it short cheering McGee hustles for the offensive board Somerville gets the three Theyre going to live behind the threepoint line More than half their shots are threes And that is the eighth threepointer for Florida State tonight How about the composure in the face of a terrific contest by Nate George Just relaxed confident easy Good defense there by McGee Takes it away from Freeman McGee bumps with Kings The basket counts And thats three on Nate Kings Florida State flipping the script a little bit Anish playing some defense changing it up a little bit and theyre getting steals forcing turnovers and finishing in transition Kobe McGee have yourself a night out in transition Okay Certificate Triple header tomorrow on ACCN Pit goes to Georgia Tech UNCC and Duke both out west Carolina at Stanford Duke at Cal Little late night ACC after dark Meanwhile Kobe McGee with the lights on has been on here at the Carrier Dome The JMA wireless dome Careful No I He has been Hes been really good Um I did call them the orange men earlier There you go But it was orange spacemen So for anybody confused No Kobe Kobe McGee has been terrific Hes been patient and a lot of times when a guy starts feeling himself and hes playing well uh youll force a shot or two Not the case for him four or seven from the field Every shot has been a quality look And thats when you thats what you get when you get a transfer from Drexel who has been a lifetime scorer at that school He comes down to Florida State He understands if that balls working Im going to be able to find opportunities Hes done a terrific job today He was the first player to commit to the new staff Luke Lous youngest head coach in division one Betsy catch release count and pull away Has he been feeling it Five for seven from threepoint range And not a second thought I mean one track mind right there He caught it Knew it was going up I thought it was a good close out by Steam How about 68 on arms high release Have to get a little bit closer than that Hes got 15 That doesnt wins the battle on the glass and able to draw the foul Its on Betsy Ken Anthony checks in You talk about all the pressure that he faced coming in Theres dad Carmelo Anthony who is a legendary player and that doesnt even begin to do it justice with what he did at Syracuse Lone season here in 03 was a 2010 guy freshman of the year and oh by the way won the schools only national championship as Jones hits the group I was talking to Red Aut before the game talking to Alan Griffin assistant coach earlier in the day and they both said you know the whole idea of being Carmelos son and following in dads footsteps the pressure the expectations none of that stuff bothers him No hes a mature young man And I think to compare him directly would be irresponsible but unfair to him because hes a six five guard who can score it But his dad was this imposing quick you know big size big time scorer William Pal Speaking of which thats a grown man at the five spot And before the game when we got to the gym this afternoon around noon there was one guy warming up here for Syracuse That was Ken Anthony And now this was earlier before the game today just while the teams were warming up Carmelo giving his son some pointers Love that So Carmelo wore 15 at Syracuse Cayenne wears seven which is the number that Carmelo wore through a big part of his pro career including most notably with the Knicks and the Olympics And the Olympics Yeah Arguably the greatest fee forward of all time I I dont think theres much question Its like him and Kevin Durant Id put Charles Barkley in that mix too Barkley was a heck of an Olympic player I would I would argue Carmelo because of how many times he played in international competition Just a terrific terrific player Ball spins sideways Syracuse led by as many as 10 Florida State Has the deficit down to three White went for the steal Out of contact with Jones 10 to shoot Somerville That pass is deflected Somerville for the tie Got it He plays at his own paceville after watching Somerville play today And I and I saw him a little bit at UMass LOL Hes a guy that doesnt get sped up He takes his time in his shot Unbelievable composure in the face of pressure defense Florida State 10 of 20 from three They got a chance to retake the lead Jones to McGee Thought about it Jay Jones had a game this year where he hit 10 threes That one no good He and Betsy crashed to the floor I thought he got fouled Stling hesitation and fouled by Basson And I like the aggression by Syracuse hitting downhill JJ Starling I I mean he puts so much pressure on you Tomas Bong whos done a lot of really good things tonight Hes provided energy Hes done a lot of good things If you get your body position correct you could set yourself up to take a charge But hes a freshman Freshman are allowed to be freshman Contrary to popular belief this years freshman class has raised the expectations for everybody And last year that too I mean you you see the success of last years freshman class and the rookie class of the NBA this season Conanipple Super Flag having outstanding seasons So Syracuse at the free throw line tonight just two of five entering play Theyre amongst the very worst free throw shooting teams in the country at 63 However since Donnie Freeman has come back a pretty good free throw shooter in their three ACC games theyre close to 80 from the foul line but 63 on the season Thats why theyre off to such a good start in ACC play I mean Freeman just opens so much up for you on the offensive into the floor And sometimes shot making breeds more shot making Somerville forced that one And thats going to be Oia back on Wiggins his third foul Good box out Nate George And Wiggins I appreciate his assertiveness This is a guy that hasnt always been like that Great kid Transfers from Clemson down to Tallahassee He has a lot of skill at 610 He shoots the ball well Consistent effort in that same vein Youre willing to live with some of those over the back calls Last year at Clemson he played almost 24 minutes a game at 610 and he averaged only 29 rebounds Thats it to George Shots like a three George cheering through the contact with a chance at a threepoint play Just a really good play Nate George playing away from the ball Nice pitch ahead pass and you have a stampede downhill Betsy attacks the gaps Nate George goes right away and see Somerville slightly out of position Thats an older player recognizing I have an opportunity to get on top of the shoulders of the defense and finish Sixth team foul on Florida State Somerville and Nathan George the ACC assists leader last year at Georgia Tech to the free throw line Been terrific tonight And what I mean with with a stampede as soon as he catches it hes catching it on the run to go Theres no hesitation in his mind whether or not hes attacking the rim Its really good work by George Syracuse now three for seven at the line McCrae hits Turbo and a foul Hey I just talked about a freshman not taking a charge on one end Same thing here with Ky Anthony You got to get out in front Anthony picks up the foul We take immediate timeout threepoint game here in Syracuse Monday the ATT Countdown to the College Football Playoff National Championship on ESPN Amen This is 100 each And hes got 200 Our ACC Network crew has Miami covered before during and after the College Football Playoff National Championship game on Monday Inside Access at 5 the huddle at 6 music Then its field pass for the game And the huddle is back for the post game We are down to Miami and Indiana Terrence Oglesby All right time to make the picks Put it on the line Its an easy one for me Im going Miami Why am I going Miami Well I got three reasons One I like Carson Beck Two the defensive line for Miami has been terrific And three I want to see Eric Mlane go nuts on everybody on Twitter Thats probably the biggest one of Im going to go Indiana In the words of the great McBain Mendoza Fernando Mendoza Theyve got the Heisman winner Elijah Serat at wide receiver Kurt Signetti coaches this team where they dont make mistakes They play together They tackle in space They dont beat themselves They have bludgeoned Alabama They sledgehammerred Oregon I love Miami in the trenches Maui Noah on the offensive line Bane to Saint Bassador in the defensive line I I just think Indiana all the stars are aligning for the Hooers Youre about to become a football program How many people knew Mark Cuban was an Indiana alum until about 5 minutes ago Well I did because because Im a basketball guy so I I dont know if that counts Im probably not Im thinking most people most people Youre absolutely right Indiana alums now coming out loudly and proudly wearing all their Hooser cheering stuff So I think its going to be a great game but I I I like Indiana No ACC bias for Anish Strong Not a not even a little Right down the middle Thats it Jim Phillips on line one Here comes Le Jones MCCRAE GOT blocked by White But the put back there by Jones and Florida State with a onepoint lead 1120 to go for a Syracuse team thats won backtoback ACC road games Now the way the ACC is set up this year theres more quality wins to be had from the last few years but Florida State would be a quad three loss And George turns it over Kyle Anthony trying to make the case the ball was tipped From our angle it was not tipped So I I could have gotten a bad look at it I dont think it was tipped either How about Florida State AJ Swind coming in the game making some things h happen Syracuse needs to wake up a little bit Well be back in 30 seconds Nate George eight points 10 assists four turnovers and thats been the one bugaboo whos had five or more turnovers six times and in the last two games both wins hes turned it over six times And he was attacking the defense looking to draw two and thought Kayen Anthony was going to step into it Cayenne kind of out waiting for the ball Excellent point guard match up McCrae over George Thats a goend cheering on Sadique White That ones close but I trust the eyes of Roger Ay whos been doing this for a while Were going to be able to take another look at it Sadique White a terrific athlete Robert McCrae goes up Thats on the way down Very close to a correct call Threepoint lead for Florida State Nolles in the midst of a 60 run Theyve mixed up their defenses all night Freemans been quiet of late Jump step and foul on the floor before the shot Its on Wiggins and thats four Thats a big loss because he gives you floor spacing on the offensive end plus the size to match up with Donnie Freeman Johny Wiggins four fouls Thats thats going to be tough Freeman 79 at the free throw line One of the better free throw shooters on this team And he makes the front end of a one and one Both teams in the bonus Straight in Back I would imagine Syracuse looks for Donnie Freeman a little bit more over the last 10 minutes and change of this game Hes been efficient tonight and hes six of nine from the field One for three from beyond the arc cheering Hes a guy you can go to in times of need applause Hes got 16 cheering Theres AJ Swinton Thats a careless turnover applause Swinton pats his chest as if to say on me Thats a killer Swinton didnt play in the first half Created a turnover right when he got in the game But youre on the road in conference play At least its a dead pole turnover but still need to take care of the basketball Fancy cheering has had the hot hand from three Five of seven from downtown Sadique White puts it on the floor takes it to the rim Syracuse with a onepoint lead Such an athlete How much space does he cover Long strides Gets to the cup cheering The floater falls Hey Robert McCraes a handful He is I mean he is physically strong 11 for McCrae Anthony the baseline drive Out of bounds to Syracuse 19 to shoot And in comes Bang for Swinton Pretty good minutes by Swinton coming in creating a turnover Just trying to create some havoc Havoc Thomas Basson has proven himself to be an every second guy Betsy left wide open and that is his sixth cheering three of the night Thats a careerhigh for threepointers made in a game Theyve needed him to be big Florida State going zone They needed that guy to step out An ancillary piece Tyler Py two time Gatorade player of the year in the state of Connecticut out of high school showing exactly why Top 65 repeating cheering the steel They got Betsy as a trailer Anthony instead took it to the rim White on the offensive glass and it swirls through Nice play Sadique White You see bits and pieces up cheering Here comes McCrae cheering McGee Florida State looking for an answer Syracuse cheering has made four of its last five McGee lost it Shot clock down to five Its tipped away And here come the Orange in transition again Anthony blocked for the foul cheering and applause Comes back to getting stops Right With this Syracuse team they get stops They have so many athletes that can get out and go Kenne Anthony just seeing his opportunity to attack Not in legal guarding position He was on the body first before the block shot Le Jones his first So Anthony 61 from the free throw line misses the first and Syracuse five for 10 now at the stripe William Kyle checks back in for the Cuse Somerville in for Florida State Swinton back in there as well One out of two Its a fivepoint game Eight and a half left cheering Syracuse has won two straight Florida State has lost three in a row and eight of 10 picks up the dribble cheering Steam bodies up Kyle on Kings Another turnover Live ball Sterling the long cheering above the rim applause Talk about athleticism Anishh Sadique White has it in spades And a couple of forced turnovers have ignited have ignited this Syracuse crowd cheering get a couple of turnovers Oh now it looks like they are warning Sadique White and they gave him a technical foul So after the foul a technical foul 742 to go in regulation a personal foul and a technical foul Thats why you first talking Everybody As we were going to break Sadi White picked up a personal foul and then his reaction to the foul earned him a technical foul Little too much and some colorful music Im sure wording excuse me not music Uh cant do that Heres the thing A few possessions prior catches a lob dunk few before that big time defensive stand Like this is part of the maturation process You have a super talented young player whos a freshman trying to make his impact felt on the defensive end of the floor cheering This is a grow This is a growing experience for him So Kobe McGee will shoot the two technical foul free throws 76 free throw shooter cheering 18 points for McGee He and Betsy lead all scores learning experience Now a one and one for Somerville This is a personal foul on Sadique Someville an 84 free throw shooter And its got a chance here This technical foul coupled with the personal be a fourpoint possession And at this point of the game just cant happen three Be smart for me All right cheering and applause Four fouls now for White and Somerville gets them both So Florida State takes advantage Thats a threepoint game with 742 to go And it seemed like all the momentum was shifting in Syracuses favor A lob dunk some defensive stops Florida State struggling to create any offense without turning the basketball over Now you kind of take the air out of the gym Technical foul You came back from break and the crowd out of the game Here comes Anthony Tries to split the D Turns it over Somerville Pushes the other way to Jones The tip by cheering Steam No Kyle fighting for the board Numbers for the Q Anthony kicks to Kings lets it fly The two is good And a little bit of energy Nice play Ken Anthony I thought he had the lob there to Donnie Freeman stays a little bit more patient and Nate Kings cheering when he gets his feet set and hes not rotating his hips on the three Somerville fouled on a threepoint shot by Sterling Three more shots coming for Somerville an outstanding free throw shooter Just silly Cant happen Try to get through Theres some ball there That is not a lot of contact cheering Nonetheless contest Dont foul Live to fight another day cheering and applause 14 points tonight for Somerville He has shaken off a tough game Saturday Was one for seven two points cheering and a blowout loss to NC State I think everybody had a tough game Saturday but this is a but you see the flow of this game is much different The effort is different And you look at NC State sometimes the style makes the fight Theyre a little smaller Theyre quicker to shooters and they have a bunch of older players kind of in the same vein and it was just a bad matchup Plus talk to Luke Bl They hit everything to open the game They shot 55 from the field cheering 19 of 35 from three But defending the three has become problematic here for Florida State Duke shot it well from three NC State shot it well Syracuse tonight 11 of 24 from three The Orange have not been a great threepoint shooting team this season although they did hit 10 on Saturday against Pit in 22 tries Shot clock at five Kings leaned into that one Long rebound to Freeman A new 20 Skip pass picked Somerville attacking Blocked by Freeman cheering Numbers for the Q Freemans the trailer A cheering blocking foul called on McCrae applause Excellent block on the defensive end of the floor You see Donnie Freeman when youre the guy giving effort Often times youre the guy thats rewarded Kayen Anthony finds the scorer in transition really close to a charge Feet werent set And Donnie Freeman knows how to finish So talented that young man and Tio that dimension the block shot that was lacking for this team last year they had 83 block shots all season last year the fewest by a Syracuse team since 1982 This year when you count today 114 blocks already applause and cheering Thats always been the mark of Syracuse Theyve always had this rim protecting guy some of their better teams cheering and this year they just have mult multiple guys that can be that guy McCrae over the trees Well hes a good looking player Columbia South Carolina native Went to AC Florida Hes a guy He looks like a wide receiver And Syracuse gives it back 8277 535 to go That look by Red Autry I think sums it up for a lot of the Syracuse faithful here Been a tough little stretch here He took a lot of heat after the Hofster loss some of their other losses in nonconference Houston Kansas Iowa State those are all quality teams They almost beat Houston took them to overtime cheering and a double dribble applause This if Florida State can rally cheering it would not just be Luke Louds first ACC win as seminals head coach It would far and away be the goals best win of the season Nulls have not won outside of Tallahassee this year Seven and three at home 0 and3 away from home 0 and6 away from home The whole complexion of this Florida State team looks different than what it has in the last few games Freeman acrobatic is toughman Big time shot from a big time player Are you kidding Jones posting up Freeman over Freeman Nice looking move by Le Jones And Freemans got to call a timeout Syracuse could not inbound it Donnie Freeman you need a bucket You can go to number one Jack Donnie Freemansons coming back from a foot injury averaging 22 points per game And music when Syracuse needs a bucket hes their guy Absolutely How about the skill level at 69 to be able to go between the legs spin away from the defense use his leverage Its a big time shot and this guy can really really play completely opened up the Syracuse offense Yeah they have been a team relying a lot on their defense since Freeman has come back The offense has seen a significant uptick almost beat Clemson and then backtoback double digit road wins against Georgia Tech and Pit Theyve scored 84 tonight Theyve shot 61 from the field and we get a foul and its going to be on Steam And that is the 10th team foul on Florida State So Syracuse and the double bonus line again not a good free throw shooting team but better of late although today only seven of 12 Freeman however four of four make it five of five Luke LS animated over on the side It comes to crunch time in East Theyre going to Donnie Freeman here Over the last three or four minutes its going to be his show Hes got 23 Meanwhile Chanty Wiggins whos inbounding is back in the game Hes got four fouls cheering and applause Syracuse going old school Extended two3 defense McGee from the corner In and out Rebound Kyle Its a good look And if youre Luke Low you go to the guy who has played as well as anybody in tonights contest Kobe McGee just not able to knock it through Feels like it hit every part of the rim just to go out Florida State made seven of its first 11 threes since then Three for 13 There they go to Freeman Theres the double Freeman to Kings Kyle tries to tap it home Loose ball knocked out of bounds by Kyle who flies into the Phottos Under four media timeout Can Florida State spring bring an upset and a comeback Or will Syracuse hold on ChickfilA sandwich All right everybody in Easter box 41 Come on cheering cheering Heat cheering ACC mens basketball presented by Tro music Price Invest with confidence alongside Terrence Oglesby and is Shrav Its been a fun one tonight at the dome Both teams playing a fun fast style of basketball A lot of threes a lot of flow to this game And now it comes down to the Stars And for Syracuse they have Donnie Freeman back Hes put together his third straight 20point game Youve got a feeling its going to go through him Who does it go through for Florida State I I think youre trying to find looks for Kobe McGee and thats what hes been today Hes been patient getting some of these open shots especially from deep but at the same time you have to put pressure on the rim and that starts with number six with the ball Robert McCrae McCrae 13 points six assists He does not have an assist in the second half Somerville dangerous from three Wiggins over Kyle Thats a tough shot Offensive rebound McGee There he is Thats tough Hes had a fantastic game today McGee That will be 20 points for Kobe McGee Two possession game We come up on three minutes to play And again go back to zone defense Can you find a guy to block out And its back to the Donnie Freeman shot They get it to Freeman They were trying to get it to him Had the size advantage Now its Sterling down the lane Tough move Good patience Donnie Freeman too Backing in the defense getting that second defender to commit and giving JJ Sterling an avenue McCrae tries the answer follows his shot kicks it out Three on the way short McCrae chases it down while the state retains possession Now its taken away by Freeman Freemans everywhere in winning time cheering Stling may have jammed a finger shaking his left hand Hes got 11 points tonight on five of seven Another efficient night for the senior from nearby Baldwinville Shot clock at 10 George 11 assists Freeman the three not there And a foul on Syracuse And that will put Florida State at the line It is on Kyle Thursday night 10 Eastern Uh Sunday at 4 PM excuse me Weve got our gymnastics meet Stanford and UNCC gymnastics season starting on ACCN Nice job Robert McCrae You get switched off on a big you better box out Holding his ground and he gets rewarded at the free throw line I would expect to see pressure for Florida State after these free throws Make sure if youre Syracuse youre in a press break This is up to Nate George You need to be communicating right now Hey guys this is where were supposed to be Two minutes to go Youre going to see some type of fullourt pressure cheering That one no good Rebounded by Freeman Florida State 17 of 23 at the line Still a two possession game Less than two to play Trey out to defend George now picked up by Steen on the switch George shot fake kicks to Sterling Lets it float The follow is there by Freeman and one The man is everywhere Nice job JJ Stling putting pressure on the rim Shot goes up little floater and Donnie Freeman like hes done all day today come up with a big bucket flexing on everybody in the baseline The foul is on Steam Originally they gave it to Wiggins It would have been five on Wiggins Rebound there by McGee Syracuse back in the two3 zone Jones strong cheering to the rim Hey if youre a shot blocker sometimes youre going to get Le Jones Jones terrific finish gets the two3 zone Seven to shoot Here comes George Launches way off That hit the backboard And now Somerville Thought that was a quick whistle And a foul is called Its on Betsy and Florida State to the line So if youre the NLES these are chances at three points with no time running off Martinville Mark Somerville on the season 84 Hes been right on that mark today cheering Florida State you got to give them credit Theyre coming off a huge loss at home and theyve come out with big time effort and and I want to attribute it to Luke saying Im going to go with the guys that plays to start this game out They set a tone for the next 38 minutes right That this this is a Florida State team Theyre very much in a different phase of the program after so many years of Leonard Hamilton Luke LS has these guys on the right track They have to continue to figure it out in some of the different nuances of the college game of course but you see what it looks like when they when theyre playing well They reshuffle the starting lineup today George gets it over the timeline 90 to 86 We come up on 40 seconds to play Theres the double now Betsy 10 to shoot Betsy almost threw it away George with five with four down low cheering When fails just throw it at the rim Unbelievable Out of bounds to Florida State 209 on the clock And Wiggins comes back in to add length and threepoint shooting All five on the floor for Florida State can knock down a three Nate George in case in case of emergency break glass and just throw it at the glass and William Kyle will finish it for you A season high 12 helpers for George and also matches a careerhigh Now McGee long three McCrae air ball Freemans there Florida States got a foul now applause They wont STERLING screaming THROWS cheering DOWN A TOMAHAWK JAM McGee launches No good Somerville the rebound His shot swatted out of the air by Betsy who caps a career night with a block shot Betsy
