go SMU won a twopoint game they survived at the buzzer got a late tip in to Win It Syracuse looking for a second straight upset starts with the basketball game four of four a two of five here at the ACC tournament in Charlotte jquan Carlos sets up a three for JJ Starling he was one for 10 from three against SMU last Tuesday and hes one for one tonight good early execution set play he runs the Baseline they go over top he gets an easy look thats what you want if youre a scorer to see one go down early there are the five double figure scores for SMU 22 and9 on really the fringes of the bubble theyd probably need to make it to the ACC Championship Game to have a chance and Matt FR tied up there SMU with the arrow they were on the bubble for a while they dont have a quad one win whats The Fringe of a bubble look like theyre just out out of the next four out for Joel lardy but hes still listing them thats the to the bub thats right BJ Edwards ribs it out Starling and lampin part of the Syracuse starting five with Carlos Lucas Taylor and Gyer Davis and here is lampin and hes called for travel by Bert Smith along with Ron gr and Justin Porterfield on the crew just wonder if Lins going to get a straight up look down low thats going to be challenging think I think Carlos is going to have to have a good game hes been much better hes really settled into a solid role he doesnt try to do too much thats where hes at his best SMU fourth best offensive team in the ACC great shooters from two excellent shooters from three Edwards crossed for three rounded out and lampin controls the rebound he one of the worst Syracuse teams in a long time but its one of their best rebounding team teams in a while lamin best rebounder in the league in conference game spins in for two and another hot start for the orange I love what when Eddie lampin gets involved that he brings great energy he talks a little bit but hes just kind of a funloving guy you can tell that the bench feeds off of his good play Down Low first five for the orange heres yo Miller the transfer from Wake Forest Zips it into the corner Harris passed up the three Edwards will hit it all right great example of balance if you get a defense to Chase and pretty much all four around the perimeter can shoot youre youre beat and Syracuse was beat early in that possession good little ball movement find the open man you got a wide open look balance teams are really difficult to defend Syracuse LED almost the whole way yesterday by 16 in the second half it was cut to one in the closing seconds at SMU 8 days ago they led by 12 12 in the second half and blew that they turn it over used to struggle with that all year and here is Harris the terrific shooter on the slip for you gou flips it short and Davis for Syracuse right there he had a terrific game yesterday you may not always show up in the stats but he influenced everything they did well did that guy it did show up in the stats 27 yesterday five in the opening 3 minutes hes hes even more of a threat when he see a three point basket go down because then youre going to close out hard hes even better off the bouns Mustang 77 and a half a game in ACC play balanced fun fastpaced offense foul on the perimeter here will slow it down for Andy Enfield came over from USC after 11 years there with pretty good success for the Trojans and the Mustangs 13 seven in their first year in the AC see well look you you can look at the success and say yeah theyve won some games they went to NC tournaments sweet 16s you name it hes also put out ridiculously highlevel pros and thats something hes very proud of and thats something that certainly matters to todays players sh Harris around Taylor nice finish by Harris around Taylor who had just picked up a Applause foul the other thing balance gives you is space you cant help off on guys around the perimeter so theres room to work off the bounce hard screen by lampin heres Davis into cross y getu with a block from behind eight to shoot for Syracuse Lamkin Taylor rebound to BJ Applause Edwards second year on the hilltop over from Tennessee Applause Music Miller gets bodied by Carlos and thats off of Carloss me SMU ball when we come back another beans we dont like change and weve had to take on a lot of change in college sports SMU is one of those ones that just make sense in the conference as does Andy Enfield as a coach and mfield two years at Florida G Coast D City 11 years at USC bopy Miller ties it and smus got the last five I just think its going to be a fun brand of basketball and when SMU was was at its height in recent years well say like it was fun great place to play tremendous campus I just think youre going to see good things from SMU in this conference Taylor to The Cutting Starling tough two Banks it in not that tough hes three for three Miller around a screen from Cross was wide open passes it up and then Harris steps out of bounds poy Miller is frustrated with the end of that play really good close out defensively but this is not exactly how you would draw it up but youll take it nonetheless he didnt realize that Defender trailing was like thats what was intended JJ three for three start stakich in beginning zir Davis crosses all over him Starling splits two oh boy out to Carlos hell reset I tell you the decision making of Carlos is different he really understands his role now as if hes got responsibility to really initiate things and facilitate a good game Starling Davis with the hammer jier Davis with a throw down for two a lot of that is yet playing out playing through Eddie lampin down low but it starts with Carlos getting the ball and not being in a hurry just getting into something understand you dont want this to be a real track meet with SMU Carlos was terrific 8 days ago ATU 12 points8 assists 37 minutes Miller floats in home he can really score oh they got to communicate better coming off that screen Davis took his own man out just talked through Applause it Davis from Carlos I think starlings got to touch the ball if its two possessions he hasnt touched it he better touch it on the third first substitutions of the game for both teams headed to the table Harris step back thats really tough three Taylor Maybe their best defender was on him tell me what you really thought about it well it was a really tough three that was a horrific Miss thats what it was go Taylor that wont go all right again Starling needs to touch the ball Harris Motors in Taylor with the off hand block and theres a foul maybe on the body its Taylors second and stting with Carlos having the patience and presence of mind to just move the basketball here you get it into Eddie Lin go ahead great Retreat dribble welcome the double play out of the double you created Advantage bying bringing two your way Eddie lamin did a terrific job of retreat dribbling bringing the defender even further being able to pass over the and conversely the second half it flowed through JJ Starling they used a switching defense to get the match up they like and they attack so bring the double in the first half and then attack with the with the match ups you like sh Caris 85 theres Adrien ay last year Syracuse won 20 games we got bounced by NC State on the WCs way to the ACC title in final four so his first ACC tournament win as a head coach yesterday and John wildhack the athletic director who we saw before the game did confirmed last week Adrien ay will be back for year three despite the struggles of Syracuse this year 14 and 18 faith in their recruiting class they hope theyll be more active in the portal there is John wild hack enhanced nil which is the reality modern college sports and a new GM in Alex Klein so well see if Syracuse can start to turn things around in year three but they are not done of course with year two starlake Kyle cup just came off the bench and cup tried to thread through of my stovic and turns it over I think the other thing to remember in the game today is the kneejerk reaction to hire a new coach is even sillier than it ever was before in the sense that you could go 0 and 10 one look at Missouri for crying out loud you you could really struggle to win a game and then all of a sudden you could be one of the most relevant most dangerous teams in the NCA tournament so year to year its just different cylinder its on cuff SMU by the way made almost a wholesale line change car quendo tremendous shooter is in the game Johan trayor and Keon Ambrose hton two bigs they like to play two bigs at the same time and then tiet gner who is the three right now at 69 so its a very big lineup for Andy Enfield Edwards around Carlos to the rack for Carlos in that situation I like the pressure but you always have to look behind and see whats happening if its opening up you cant pressure too hard no one there to help its smus first lead Starling into barar M storic darling Rises and nem McLoud falling out of bounds gets the offensive rebound back out top seven for M Clouds been a much bigger part of this down the stretch cuff in traffic we got a foul on Ambrose Hilton SM 7775 and a pattern of late for Syracuse their last three Road games they blew double digit leads in the second half its a second losing season in four years last losing season prior 196869 and unless Syracuse runs a table itll be four straight years without a postseason for the first time since 67 to 72 what do you make of whats happened recently with Syracuse and how can they turn it around well look I I think good things have happened I think guys have been understanded they found their roles they know look theyve dealt with injuries too you know Dy Freeman being outs a big one JJ Starling was out for a while so they really lack continuity in that sense they found it as of late but they struggle to find consistency in terms of executing and picking teams apart M storic and a couple of guys were in there and the duckets up by Johan tror and heres McLoud off the back GM it goes he really plays hard he understands I always say what what makes somebody good is not just knowing what they know its knowing what they dont know knowing what I do well and understanding what I dont really do well he plays within himself the lob and okendo rims it out tough pass by the way Chris Bell got credit for that block one of three guys there hes on the floor for the first time hes got the ball right Applause now cup trying to make a play hes rejected by trayor okendo best athlete just about every game he plays watch number eight in white and a great feed to Ambrose Hilton big to Big tror with a stump and a foul its good stuff interior passing a little DB down two guys go with the basketball wide open at The Rim this Syracuse lineup chasing the ball a little bit too much good action from SMU just spaced the floor Mo the basketball Adrian ay dis pleased trar transfer from UC Santa Barbara Miss is a free throw its hard if youre coach alrey you got to find the right lineups and at times it may seem like you play guys too much but in a tournament setting weve seen it you you really tighten your rotations you got to play your best players the the majority of the minutes Applause travel have you watched much NBA recently the amount of travels they allow just like the blatant walking with the ball shiam pivot foots and that happens a lot in our game Ive noticed that guys get away with more traveling than ever before you want to see more travels called not really I just like guys to travel less called footwork all right good no call there Miller just ran into the brick wall my store of Music it game that hasnt found its Rhythm yet 1514 nearly 11 gone by in the first half Starling Movic blocked that was Tibet gner senior from Istanbul pretty much everybody on this team is a Applause transfer Miller up top there it is treor the fritzman high above the rim for a Mustang lead but thats balanced too right good ball movement you get the chase you then break the defense down off the bounce you lift that Defender up hes got to take the driver away throw over the top its hard to cover all five on the floor particularly if F four can put it on the deck and make a play Starling 6 and a half without a point and C couldnt finish hell get back to the Line This is just good stuff you get the ball movement you get a defense a step behind the play theyre chasing it look theyre pointing it out theyre trying to scramble you attack that close out lob over the top theres not much more you can do except dont give up the paint now I would say you you said a possession or two could have been a day ago um that the game really hasnt found itself yet I think it was this possession actually I would argue that that favors Syracuse youre right right it favors Syracuse SMU is a rhythm and flow team to get six guys involved to the point where they average double figures thats a rhythm and flowbased team score 80 points a game Syracuse has been able to play kind of possession to possession at times and win some games whether it be playing through Edie lampin Jr or JJ star is this something that youre trying to do then if youre Adrien ay I think you got to feel it out first you you dont want to stifle your own team by by by slowing the game down you want to find it too cross into lampin and cross gets his Miss but this is what you have to be careful of these quick hitter actions you know two guys coming with the basketball Syracuse CH in the play and the pace starting to pick up SMU was plus 18 in the paint last Tuesday and theyre starting to get their feet in there with more consistency Bell buries a three they theyre going to need that from Chris Bell you hes struggled as of late hasnt really been able to find it Miller around CU off the back of the rim and batted into cuffs hands ahead to Bell cuff to his left tries it out you for a guy whos 62 and it doesnt work but its Syracuse ball you didnt like that Im just saying there are a lot of 61 dudes in this game Kyle cuff he very skilled but is not one of them they have been better decisions one of them is getting Chris Bell off a screen I love this no one there line it up find a little rhythm in that shot be a floor spacer thats going to help Syracuse on the offensive end I dont think Clemsons gotten enough love nationally and and I think part of it is the narrative about the ACC is if if the accs down so thats why Clemsons so good that aint the case if the ACC was really good wed still be talking about Clemson cuz theyre a complete basketball team with a ton of experience I think shefflin and Chase Hunter have played together for like combined 295 games holy smokes mult multiple coaches double unicorn have said to us Clemsons a second weekend team that means the lead eight or final four potentially Louisville is up there too and then Duke right now the favorite to win it all Starling and scored in about 8 minutes rebound yat TOA 1918 Syracuse 14 seed against the six into the cross he will not finish it the first time nor the second but he gets a Music Applause foul and Chris Bell picks up his second selection Sunday returns just four days away 6 Eastern five central Sports Center on ESPN 7 Eastern anology presented by Lowes for the mens field 80 through the NCAA Womens selection special presented by Capital One for the womens field well continue to break it down after that on ESPN 2 ke theres nothing like being an analyst having to cover the brackets cuz there going to be some teams that pop out of there that were supposed to know something about that you are scrambling I mean when when Wikipedia becomes an option for information youre in trouble and if if you really think we know everything about everybody at that level its tough because the other thing you have to consider but the other thing you have to consider is like you cant just say well this is what they do this is who they are like you have to consider how they do match up I want all your spiciest SIU Edwardsville takes on Applause Sunday one of three first timers going to the tournament Omaha and High Point High Points been knocking on the door for while here in the state of North Carolina they won the Big South beautiful campus by the way Ive heard its one of the most spectacular campuses there Music is cuff will back it out 6 and a half to go into lampin hes had a quiet night hes triple team gets his own Miss for a moment and then hes going to be called for a foul here I think he pushed off youu well no out of B out of bounds could have been a foul but just says out youd be a terrible official Kevin why just want to call fouls all the time thats not remotely true some of us like a little flow how many times last game did you call for a foul that wasnt actually called P Ken my gosh although I think I was right I at least wasnt Music wrong Syracuse won for its last seven SMU meanwhile theyve only hit 13 only two for five at the line and theyre not shooting it that well from two either look at Eddie on the deck wants a timeout hell get it come help the man up what effort Eddie Lin first off does the job defending in the post sees the ball hit the floor and his body follows this is all you can ask for at this point look its a winner go home situation big boy hitting the deck presence of Mind call it timeout time out time out Music la Music Eddie lampin had a 23 rebound game earlier this year 14 double doubles in his last 20 hes been everything Syracuse hoped for honestly maybe a little more 12 and 10 on the year willing passer and they feed off of him when theyre playing well its not just the numbers I always say the most important guys its more about what you dont see and he also so brings a certain joy to this team a certain energy to this team that through their struggles thats what they really need hes really found some more joy too his final year at Syracuse only year here jard Davis thats the first made field goal for anybody about two and a half minutes hu back on top Jer Davis has been really good for them I thought he was terrific yesterday another guy plays with good energy and with he and Lin on the flooor theyre tough those are the two guys with NCAA tournament experience theres a three for Chuck Harris its almost like Syracuse needs to score for SMU to find it offensively that happens a lot scoring teams almost need to give up some points to find it on the offensive Music end smaller lineup for Syracuse here with a three guards and a dangerous pass found its way to starling hop skip jump and a pass to an out of bounds cuff thats the fifth Music turnover a lot of those Sidelines out of bounds its Music close or not no not really I will have a Music seat poopy Miller Harris hit the last three The Freshman yigao bullying his way in against lampin and a foul on the floor its Eddies firstan what would you do with that like thats Eddie lamkins a big boy y to is just a little bigger he doesnt have the touch yet you you can see that as he develops a little better softer feel around the rib kind of work both shoulders right right right shoulder left hook left shoulder right hook thats a really big body 72265 we asked Danny ffield about his recruiting and and how they convinced Yola to come here and part of his sales pitch was look at what other bigs have done in my system cross this foul by Davis think about some of the bigs he had at USC the moies yes the allaround games that they develop the thing is they develop their game inside and out and its probably more outside in right great ball movement great balance weve talked about that with indn field teams hes always had terrific length they theyre creative with the different lineups and rotations they have with how they defend Ball Street so youre really going to learn the game a little bit more not by playing one specific way but having to be a little bit more fluid I think he develops really high level pros and its something that doesnt get enough attention and and I know he wants people to know about that he should just Eric Mobley on the bench father of the Moy on the staff here for Andy Enfield brought three assistants over from USC to SMU you know as a paot you always just want to make sure your kids are are good and taken care of I wonder what that feels like yeah theyre good Music y he had a lane violation against SMU which leads by two winner of this game gets Clemson tomorrow night 930 lampin going to take it to igu and he lost possession six turnover for Syracuse and thatll be a foul Lamkin went over the head of bopy Miller and Eddie just picked up his Music second its one of those smart plays Super annoying if youre not poopy Miller and thats a tough one for Eddie lampin to pick up I mean hes a guy that hes hes really got to work hes going to go to the bench who Among Us hasnt hurdled a guy named boopy I dont even know where to go from there and thats where whether it be proud or disappointed one and one for Miller Im do enough to be both hits the first this is the largest lead for SMU at three and again you look up and down on the box score nobody really jumps out theyre doing it with balance Harris with six Miller with five Edwards with five this is what they typically do this is a a bigger line yeah this is a big lineup this is a really big lineup for SMU with Ambrose Hilton out there with eigo big lineup but Syracuse has their own Giant the cloud 74 they got gner right now on Starling his Lane hoping to give him problem 69 guarding 64 Starling out of the double Carlos Starling Clos out by gner and starlings fouled hell be taking free throws when we come back SMU in the lead say there were five votes that went to somebody else 76 out of the 81 for flag every head coach gets a vote and cant vote for their own guy yeah yeah so that means four people looked at the ACC and thought Cooper flag not the player of the year no disrespect Max R know is great no no no great no question awesome but my gosh no question but Cooper flag has just been something else and Ive said it over and over again its not about what you see we put up numbers and stats and hes LED his team in every sta category all that stuff its the things you dont see that make him great he was 17 when he got here earlier this season turn 18 when December something like that I think turns 18 in December but he plays like a 35y old talk about manipulating the game at a young age its remarkable he was a runnerup for defensive player here and by the way he easily could have won that too Chucky he having a great year for lble was awarded that into yigu working on McLoud and the cloud at 74 rips it away theyre going to need more from him down the stretch with lamin in foul trouble with two just got two Jack and the beant Giants down there and its a good battle you toos going to get better and better Syracuse shooting at 40 two for six from three they turned it over six times McLoud dribbles it and then hits the deck thats a travel not often you see nem McLoud put the ball on the ground I think sometimes its its up to the guards you got to understand you youve got to give it to him in a place where he could do something with it and not get himself in trouble Syracuse the worst turnover margin in ACC play this year minus three and a half theyre minus four right now Miller heres a quendo got it thats it I think that I think thats what weve been waiting for is to kind of let SMU find this game with good little ball movement driving kick action and if a quendo can get it going look out that combination Miller a quendo can really open this up McLoud puts it on the deck again turns it over again and somehow saved by Edwards Edwards Long steps off the glass down to yigu oh quendo got his second in a row when he gets going SMU turns into a monster well the second chance opportunities the guy that just made a shot is always the most Music dangerous Lucas Taylor SMU has been smothering defensively but they leave Starling open its good both teams just good attack off the bounds draw defense get the ball moving utilize skip passes and long Closeouts one extra pass you get Starling your best player at open Applause look Edwards got a step on Taylor into McLoud no thank Applause you nahem McLoud abused that shot who was it that was in the John Wick movie boba B yeah but Clouds next hes going to be in John Wick 5 or the next Bond movie he really gives great effort coming in off the bench too some guys just dont do too much right just just be the force that you are Edwards didnt want to shoot cuz McLoud was lingering somebodys got to shoot Miller didnt realize it too late shot clock violation Syracuse ball this is the guy we talked about you got to watch out for Endo getting it going and its all set up by a little dribble Drive action you get the defense to lose sight of a man relocate got an offensive rebounding opportunity move that thing around you too doing a good job of finding the open man on the kick out smus only hit eight threes against Syracuse in the two games hes got five Davis has an answer in Syracuse with some needed threes at the end of the half that was really set up by Carlos though breaking it down right off right off the initial surge got into the paint defense gets sucked in you kick it right back out Jer Davis has been really good at this tournament this is just good Music Syracuse missed its last 12 threes against Florida State yesterday threepoint shooting helping keep them in the game today theyre four for eight 3128 the SMU lead in the finale of a quadruple header day here in Charlotte Clemson awaits the winner tomorrow top seated team has won all three quarterfinal games today Syracuse trying to become the first team seated 14 or lower to win two games in the same ACC tournament heres a quendo driving it on Carlos oh quendo blocked by mlau thats his second and the orange can hold for one what an effort by nem McLoud down the stretch yes I I mean absolutely again not trying to do too much just just making his presence known inside on the defensive end Davis closing seconds puts up a tough one and it ribs out but we got a ball game offense started to open up a little at the end of the half I think that favors Syracuse if theys see if he can get more involved here in the second its Davis right now oneonone with cross and Davis is blocked by cross Ry Miller the tempo Setter for SMU gets it back from Harris and rounded out on a three yeah thats a good start if youre SMU you got a good stop they clearly went to Jer Davis because hes not going to get the double yet they trust cross down low to just defend straight up which he did a terrific job what are the matchups you can take advantage of you Syracuse well I think you have to go back to Eddie lamin but hes got to get it on the Block back to the basket Force the double and play out of it its not about one individual matchup its about creating an advantage from a perceivable disadvantage Carlos off the back of the rim nice rebound by Harris 0 for three start to the half cross the trailer hands off yatu his first points come with authority that was just good stuff by cross and what a great start to the half for him good defense with the possession against Jer Davis and then catching it on the Fly and drawing two and dumping it down for yugu hard to imagine that kid as a freshman 72 265 averaging 10 and six its like the Danny Elman of freshman did you get that reference ref I grew up on Long Island stolen from Starling Here Comes Miller down the floor and bopy Miller will get back to the line you know who probably didnt grow up in Long Island bopy Miller dannyel Mi look this is just good stuff I mean cross is really the guy on the Fly Little P fake draws defense nice dump down I think part of the struggles for Eddie lamin is like he works hard and hes had to play significant minutes and they battle they double thats exhausting hes got to really fight down low on the defensive end I just think you make it easier by well welcoming the double Retreat dribble out of it make it easier for everybody else and then maybe you start to get a single coverage down low Music Miller with a team High seven couple of assists to Steel Somewhere Out There Daniel Montys watching hes like what the heck did I Applause do weve definitely surpassed our over under of zero for Daniel Monte references during this I guess you have to set it in a half sevenpoint lead for SMU their largest was nine near the end of the first half Syracuse cut it to three at the break you know thats thats how JJ Starling got it going in the second half yesterday was was really just getting the match up at attacking get going towards the basket he got pullup jumpers but he got a a lot of floaters its going to force the defense to rotate over theyve been able to get on the offensive glass no not on the shot I guess yeah it was going to be a shooting foul thats cross there are the numbers in the first round so he had eight in the first half last night 19 in the second he had 11 in the first half tonight Grimace as well C team thats been without Donnie Freeman for a couple of months Adrien up was not happy they missed the action he wanted on that out of bounds play lampin will screen yulu flashes out to Starling who throws it into the first rope turnovers are starting to really pile up and an early but understandable timeout taken by Red ay might need to let off some steam here Mustangs by Music seven stop the count they got to play more games unfortunately or maybe fortunately UNC Wake Forest will be a good one 230 here tomorrow after Duke Georgia Tech this place is going to be rocking for the morning session Stanford Louisville and then Clemson against the winner of this game at night out of the timeout thrown away a low pass from Harris just the fifth SMU turnover Syracuse has turned it over 10 times and hit just 10 shots this is a dangerous stretch for the arch jquan Carlos Davis has the switch here hes got the size on Miller cross switched onto him and Carlos misses a three Edwards down the floor no Music Applause numbers igat TOA working against lamin to take control left hand into him lamin swats at the ball its going to go to Syracuse you know frustrating if your SMU to turn it over but I do feel like the cumulative effect of going down low is going to wear Eddie lampin down and they really need Syracuse really needs him on the offensive Applause B Starling into the paint cross its another jump ball on another Matt cross block his second SMU six and the Mustangs had the arrow Matt cross has just a knack for how to play this game he gets over there goes straight up thats the wall up were talking about years ago they either slid in front to try to take a charge or they blew the whistle and called it a foul any play at The Rim felt that way but the wall up has made the game more fun mat cross his third ACC team he was at UMass last year as well Harris nice skip nice shot and the largest lead perz Samu this good little action on the ball side overloaded and Harris just wide open you help over for a split second you get beat from three seven points in the second half all for the Mustangs Carlos hounded by Miller yigu knocks it into the lap of Donnie Freeman and Syracuse yet to score SMU threatening to pull away and its ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball its brought strugles with ball handling 11 turnovers for the orange 10 made shots 11 turnovers and SMU has turned that into 16 points a 10point lead the largest of the game where do Syracuse find an answer as SMU has been all over defensively tonight theyre not going to find it here they had no idea the shot clock was about to expire its been the problem the initial surge hasnt worked and the secondary op option hasnt worked and then they get impatient and turn it over still think Eddie Lins got to be involved but Yus done a good job of forcing them off the block and kind of negates any threat cross quickly into U an can knocked it away oh saved Chris Bell at the death that thing was headed for the Music Applause cheerleaders Applause Carlos Bell for three was contested right to lamin Applause out of bounds off of SMU it feels like Syracuse is playing Five on six right now maybe five on seven at times so negative thats positive toward SM no I honestly think youre right uh I wish I said it first thank you Johns insecurities on full display past 1100 on a Wednesday a better analyst too oh no cuff lost it on a crazy dribble and fouled cross you can see it in body language too and the one guy you dont really see it in is Eddie lkin I I just I think he brings such a great energy but you got to get him the ball in a situation where hes comfortable and he can be a threat they did it in the first class half early where he got it on the Block and he was able to make a play out of the block making it easier for everybody else now EO goes to the bench so youve got an option you got to get it down low against am Rose Hilton Harris for three oh a deep one you go Zone and you give that up going Zone doesnt mean you can get lazy if anything you got to work even harder you got to communicate even more first 10 and a half to the Mustangs lampin squeezes it into Davis finally a Syracuse basket good short roll action lampin made the right decision in terms of putting it on the floor but stopping making the right decision o quendo dribbling through the zone out top Miller corner for cross couple of dribbles slithers inside and gets fouled foul on Daviss third its been really tough but bringing Eddie Lin into the play good little short roll stop good recognition right a lot of bigs they just run through everybody like a freight train he was good and patient and again closing out with hands down if you can step into a shot create good rhythm with your footwork your shot preparation it becomes a higher percentage shot when theres no real close out with high hands it feels like a wide open Applause look cross is two for five at the Line 6 minutes into the half the six seed leading by 11 Davis has a clean look they havent had many of those Cher Davis is is one of those guys that he just changes the game for hes a tough match up at the four position hes strong and physical and if he can shoot it with consistency hes a real threat cross flashes to the high post here gets it from Endo drives it in on cup couldnt finish over lamin but tips his Miss in hes just been tough both sides of the ball the defensive end he stood his ground really well offensively hes making things happen Carlos down it comes to trayor and then jquan took it back cuff on the right wing way Applause short white cross in the middle of this Zone mainly because I trust his decision making Harris cross flashes and rebounds and thats why Syracuse has struggled in years past its tough to Rebound in the zone and they give up one to cross for a 12point lead particularly when you have a baseline Runner that flattens out those bottom line guys and Crosses at the foul line no ones really there to block them out Bell runs right into traffic and a foul called against Miller just the second the half I just again I like cross in his position I like his decision making but I also like his ability to get in and rebound on the offensive end particularly the defense gets spaced out east to west the last guy youre really thinking about is that middle man against the Zone A lot of times guys go with with ball handlers Playmakers but but if you could trust cross to make good decisions hes hes in the right position there really nice allaround game from tonight heres cup with another try lampin back out Carlos hell spin out of three and its Harris eventually Edwards knocked away from trayor by Lampkin orange three on two cup Bell got it down to 10 with 12 to play in the second round winner go home game just feel like the pace is Shifting they try to go Zone the slowest you down but good ball movement kind of negates what youre trying to do in terms of shutting off the water all kinds of space in a Miss three by their best Marksman Harris Carlos just got bailed out by cup there lampin is fouled on the deck theyre trying to fight their way back into the game Syracuse JJ starlings been out for a little while getting some work done in the tunnel Syracuse has to pick things up you got to hope for some misses particularly if youre going to be in that zone and then you got to get out and run huse has missed a number of opportunities in transition this one was much Music better if you want some tshirt who wants a tshirt Applause I cant hear you Applause Applause sh Applause Music Music la Music this is JJ Starling Syracuses leading scorer hes been on the exercise bike for a little bit this may have been the play around 18 minutes to go in the half fouled by Matt cross and we saw a grimus from JJ after that and he played a couple more minutes before walking off gingerly hes been out of the game now for the last 413 again not a doctor but it looks like hit flexor groin area which falls into really annoying category and hes had some injuries that have ranged from really annoying to a lot more than that his career so Syracuse without their leading score a a very tall task and they turn it over again thats the 13th SMU with cross Edwards and now yigu who got fouled by McLoud theyve got gner out there as well along with Harris youo is in a little bit of pain thats left shoulder that you could see right away I dont know yeah okay yeah thats left shoulder 1120 To Go Cement yatu in some serious pain will walk past the bench anybody out there whos dislocated a shoulder understands what that feels like and Im not saying thats what he did but shoulders are Music tough darlings been through that sure if he just got caught up or got hit gosh you dont even know what it is this one thing you really hate to see guys get hurt in this game its a reality I went through a lot of that but just want to see guys play healthy see full teams its a rarity these days Harris commits his first foul after turning it over heres yigu in the tunnel hasnt scored much but hes had a big impact on the game today I mean he was in immediate pain Applause too JJ Starling is back on the floor here for Syracuse so one of the injured Stars returns with a 11 minutes to Music Applause go theyll get him back involved with 15 to shoot bounces it into Davis tough Applause one thecloud fumbling for the ball its down to Edwards smus held up on the glass Id like to see Davis have more room to work I think part of the challenge is cross has been able to cover him with no real room cross find a spot and hes into double figures for the 15 straight game hes one of those guys too that that impacts the game without youre really knowing it difficult on the defensive end physical and tough gets to the right spot Starling off the back of the rim he tracks it down Bell charges in lost it on the way up heres the runout with Edwards and Starling got back to steal it found Bell on the outlet they really needed that shot and cup will draw a foul crashing in there for the rebound its on Edwards is second there are open spots on the floor if if you know how to find him in this Zone its wide open across the foul line area cross just just a smart player to put in the middle of that zone and again its not because of playmaking sometimes you put a playmaker there but other times you just put the guy that you trust to make the right decision that cross has the last six for SMU Starling on the switch finishes over trayor his first points of the half its good to get him going we talked about a second half yesterday 19 points in the second and he just hasnt been able to find it here I mean again tweak something was out of the game for quite a few minutes there drops back into the Zone SMU drops it down to cross again set up Miller for an open three Here Comes Syracuse with 920 to play smus done a good job in terms of ball screen coverage too Starling swatted off the rim by cross Music winner of this game faces Clemson tomorrow a tiger team that went 18 and two tror with a beautiful touch I just feel like Syracuse is at a point where they know theyre gased they know theyre limited probably not at a 100 Health theyre going to the Zone but that Middles wide open lampin blocking foul against cross Syracuse just four for 18 in the second half Eddie lampin will try to get some back at the line and weve talked a lot about the balance for SMU and again having the best player on the floor is certainly a luxury and a weapon but having great balance is a weapon too theres a lot of trust on the floor when you have balance its not about you know you being the leading score or getting the ball to your leading score its just about getting the ball to the open guy and that can be fun cross will take a seat 836 to go Ambrose Hilton back out there who would you say on the floor for SMU could go for 30 on any given night I would say oin thats the first name I think of is oin thats who you would think hes probably played the least of anybody on the floor right now and its and his body language doesnt tell you that they have been really engaged defensively SMU and theyre a better offensive team than they are defensive but tonight theyve locked down Syracuse for an 11point lead remember they gave up 75 at home to Syracuse 8 days ago heres Endo dont give him space he misses everything so you can give him space sometimes good good breakdown there Kev you know I had the Adas title belt for a couple of minutes over got to back you did take it back you did heres yigu we left about 3 minutes of game action AG go grasping his left shoulder and hell sit on the very end of the Mustang bench SMU and jool lardy has them out of the next for out so they probably need to win this tournament to make the ncaas they could get there if they make the final but they got a lot of work to do good news for them theyre doing the work right now theyre up by 11 with 754 to by points assists and rebounds it its often the things that go unseen Matt cross has been terrific for SMU hes done it on the defensive end hes been a facilitator hes been a ball mover hes scored enough 10 points eight rebounds at the moment headed on his way to a double double just been a really impactful performance and its often the a guy that is somewhat overlooked in The Scouting Report that has the biggest impact on the game thats been Matt Ross 15 straight game in double figures 21 out of 22 from Beverly Massachusetts in his fifth College year Miami Louisville couple of years at UMass under Frank Martin when he got a start there and now ending his career for a good SMU team try to pick up win number 23 and stay alive here the ACC Chuck Harris weaving in drops it off or Ambrose Hilton is fouled with two to shoot by my storic Philip 66 Big 12 Mens Basketball Championship bracket Baylor probably sealed its fate as an NCAA tournament team beating Kansas State Iowa State Crush Cincinnati that ends the Bearcat chance and 16 seated Colorado beat West Virginia Kansas and UC and how weird is it to see Kansas playing on a Wednesday currently on ESPN 2 and Kansas leads that game by one with 316 to go he says something I mean you look at the payroll for Kansas State see their struggles you look at Kansas its not what wins right you can get great talent I think Duke is one of those teams where they got great young talent but its really more about the other guys its its the seion James and Mason Gillis and Malik Brown those guys really make Duke more than you know Bell its a lot of tough shots for Syracuse so lack of them getting good action versus the way smus defending them how do you break down the struggles on that side of the ball I think its a combination of both I also think its just theres a limitations of of weapons for Syracuse thats just reality which is something that for decades and decades you didnt say about Syracuse basketball Starling another really really tough shot Ambrose Hilton pulled that one down I think you also get to a point where you get frustrated you get settle and then you get tired and frustrated and you settle even more and I feel like thats where were at with Syracuse right now tired frustrated sadly Syracuse has 10 points in the second half Miller Starling still engaged defensively swats it out of bounds triple sub for Syracuse Carlos Taylor and lampin for bellovich and cup you to checking back into the game good to see that boy thats really good it looked like he might be done for the game and maybe longer its look its not just good for this game or even this tournament this is a guy whos got tremendous potential and hes still very raw he he needs to play games he needs to just get a great feel for how to play with this group I think may nfield can do good things with him Edwards Jr steps through igu sealed off the space this is the largest lead for the SMU Mustangs 15 with six minutes to go Davis a rare open look Starling can Music it and then SMU Edwards gets down the floor ahead of everybody for the layup you see that so often when the shot comes from a guard in the corner the offense gets flat on the offensive rebounding opportunity and then the Run outs often there cross to flex it out of bounds active again for SMU which is up 14 just watch everything gets flat right there there yeah youre getting some guys back Im not sure where Taylors going Taylor ran up on that for no real reason ouch I always tell you about the guys that are First Team all love to play with hatting hatte to play against I I think Matt cross is one of those guys thinkus got about five of those guys cross the top of the line no cross is definitely top of the line like hes probably super frustrated to play against but man if you got that guy on your team like if I was picking up fives with my own team to play some pickup Im like dude Im taking him Im not trying to get hit with screens Im not trying to have a guy in position on the backside as a helper like he communicates well he does so many little things well I think you can CR credit every coach hes played for in that and thats what makes some of these transfers so valuable particularly when were looking at one and twoe teams have you been coached for some guys the really talented ones the question is not have you been coached have you been broken right like a wild stallion have you been broken have you been able to receive coaching are you able to receive criticism theres a lot of guys out there cant receive criticism at least playing for certain coaches you learn whether they can take it or not eight is 12 after the Lin free throws and thats going to stay with SMU on the Syracuse use double team they dont press much the orange but they may need to to get back into this one timeout smus second lets take a look at the SEC mens tournament bracket while we have a second here North Carolina not great saw one and then the Georgia Oklahoma game Oklahoma leads by three with 515 to go I 14 teams is a real possibility Texas beats AM tomorrow its probably a 14 Team league depending on the Oklahoma Georgia game tonight I mean Arkansas is an 89 game are you kidding me I know we talked about the SEC all the time but its no look its insane I think its going to be interesting to see in the NCA tournament I think what jumps out the most was the ACC SEC challenge those numbers you cant hide from but it really doesnt mean anything in the NCA tournament it its just a different world the NCA tournament is can you put it together to win one game thats it and and and its also where that one game at a time actually makes sense that its not just a cliche Carlos commits the sixth Syracuse foul of the half I really do its its so fun to listen to all those arguments which are completely nonsensical about like whos the best conference I dont think theres any question the SEC is the rust basketball conference and its not just top to bottom its bottom to top but next year could be completely different look at the pressure from Syracuse Harris got rid of it to Endo good patience there and then okendo nearly threw it away heres a quendo into Ambrose Hilton out to Miller going to settle this with under 5 minutes to go second round game Charlotte Miller smooth touch hes got a really good floater hit two of those in the first half going to the basket you see a smaller player dribbling at you you dont want to catch a lobo in your head so you dont really commit he finishes it well Starling bricks a three Ambrose Hiltons got Applause Music it SMU breaks pressure again theyve got numbers theyve got a layup from Keon Ambrose Hilton thats got to be what youre talking about if your SMU its like lets attack this pressure lets not welcome it pass the ball around attack the pressure by storic Music Applause no smus got a lot of players that make me think I really like that guy you know what I mean nobody says I really like that guy about nicolea yic like obviously we all love that guy they dont have Superstars they just have lots of really solid like what we did we did we set it up and we basically said look this is a balanced team this is what makes them good no real Music stars he still loves Christian lner that guy many around here do many around here dont yes itll be fun to have Duke Carolina and NC State the three or W Paris beg you paron the three NC schools in the tournament state did not make it in the morning session tomorrow its funny though how you only like theres only vitriol and hate for the teams that are great like how many really stinky teams or programs that struggle to find it have that kind of hate probably shot clog is at 20 that may be the issue here for Ron gr now its 21 this Duke fan is just trying to make it to Music Tomar over updating his dating profile you dont know that all right lets look at the Philip 66 Big 12 meds Championship bracket one more time because we got a good one yeah between UCF and Kansas 83 a pie on ESPN 2 well get to that after the ACC Brack here is the Big 12 8383 10 seconds in regulation that game is on ESPN 2 and the winner gets Arizona good start for Arizona in that conference also Houston you and I have seen a lot of Houston when we covered the American and Houston UCF ciny were in the American as was this Houston yes youre correct Houston is such a fun program to be around because they know who they are they they welcome pressure they welcome intensity theyre just a lot of fun to be around and I typically like teams that that want to get up and down and score it thats where my biases lie but I can appreciate a team with with an identity that they adhere to when they honor with it with everything in terms of how they play who they are Ive enjoyed that program I think the obvious reality is the last two years Danny hurle in the best coaching job of the country Connecticut has won the title back toback years if you broaden it out the last eight or nine years to me its Kelvin Samson that program was dead it was irrelevant frankly and theyve become one of the national powerhouses Samson who should be in the Hall of Fame they take pride in taking your pride yeah not to jump too far ahead but just just look at SMU Clemson I think the defensive performance from SMU tonight has been really good I think its a different matchup with Clemson though where you have a big and Victor lockin who can space the floor that thats a game changer theyve Hil Syracuse to 25 in the second going to have six for 24 but theyre going to get lockin theyre going to get Ian sheflin about Hunter how about the Matt cross Ian sheflin the battle of the of the do battle of the do yes they both have the yeah the shaggy Applause dogs last meeting couple of weeks ago February 22nd Clemson went into Dallas and won 7969 was a big statement game for SMU to try to get they didnt get it theyre the highest ranked team in the net without a quad one win SMU theyre ranked 50th in the net that was a quad one opportunity they went 0 and four so again if theyre on the bubble therere on the very outside of it and theyre going to need to beat Clemson and likely Louisville after that to have a chance at that point youre in the final just win the whole thing its do it its been done before a 10 seed won this thing last year NC State and then went to the final four thats an over and back on Applause Edwards where its tough if youre SMU you you want to see this thing tick tick tick down at the same time if theyre going to pressure up by half court beat them go score Clemson lost a lot from last year but brought back Hunter and Ian shefin one of the great rebounders in the ACC elevated his game as a score second team pick Chase Hunter was the first teamer Victor lockin got some votes as well Davis on the dunk inside leads at 14 and Syracuse takes its third timeout where can SMU exploit Clemson do you think honestly its a great question uh because I just saw Clemson play against Virginia Tech and I was probably the most impressed Ive been with Clemson in a long time where they were so connected on both ends of the floor their communication defensively is as good as anybodys in the country theyre a really strong defensive team on the offensive end theyve really developed something in Victor lockin similar to what Brad Brown Els had with air Sims with PJ Hall where you have a ball moving big who can step out and shoot threes and you use shefin down low he goes short Corner short Corner pops into the right spots gets out of the way when needed there also one of the more unselfish teams they they actually play for one another and I think a big piece of it is I always say that its great when your best player is is the biggest piece of your identity its also pretty darn good when the biggest piece of your identity is your most selfless player and thats Ian shefflin and the connection that that he and Chase Hunter have together after having played I think its 295 games together at one place which is just a stupid silly number that 295 295 games together I mean its not it doesnt seem right it is its not 295 games a year both combined they played them together I think its 164 and do the math okay I dont want to I dont want to do the math all right were going to get clarity on that cuz I aint making it up tayor it its 1139 14point leader here comes a quendo Ambrose Hilton rolls it home Chase Hunter played six years at that place yeah 165 games so youre adding Hunter plus chefing okay combin but thats not all right I see I I see what youre saying the idea is continuity every coach in the country talks about the desire to find continuity with the group they have the problem is most of them have to do it in such short you figure out who your team is in like September October and then you start playing together and you try to figure out some play playground Dynamics to to find one another and figure out what your teams going to look like you really dont know who your team is until you get to January February because youve been tested the superpower Brad Brownell has is he knows who these guys are they know one another theyre selfless theyre giving to one another and and they just look at this is this is a a last dance for them its a good team to do it wait till we find that stat I go in your face Kevin Brown I mean I I I think you just presented it wrong but I see what youre saying anyway we havent even mentioned Jaden Zacharys name and he was the best player in that first Clemson SMU game yeah he was 196 seven assists five steals the one thing for SMU will say they didnt have boy Miller in the game they lost by 10 without their all ACC player got to close this one out first and theyre well on their way to doing that Matt cross now with 11 points SMU leading by 17 they led by three at the half theyve held Syracuse to 21 in the second half Syracuses fewest second and a half points in a game this year is 28 against pit so its been a great defensive effort for Andy enfields Mustangs Syracuse team that was looking for its first three game win streak since the first three games of the year and theyre shortly going to be heading into an offseason of real questions disappointing year after overachieving and getting to 20 wins last year but still missing the postseason this three by Bell into the hands of okendo gorer caught by Jerel Colbert getting his first run of the night hes fouled just think if youre an SMU fan you should be excited about whats coming your way you should be excited about being in this great basketball conference that is the ACC but I think its a team that has tremendous potential in this conference and I think Indie Enfield whos proven to be able to win games and put out high level Pros which is a big piece by the way its a big piece of recruiting when you trust that whats next for you by going someplace is potentially really high level it certainly helps so does the Dollar side its the reality modern day college basketball college sports smus got the endowment they were also very happy they were just named a R1 cig research one University last month poked away from Colbert Here Comes cup in the final 8 seconds nothing in transition today for Syracuse Bell and another Applause foul fou his 19 and mfield loves to talk about the players hes developed 201718 hes up there for NBA first round picks Evan Mobley whos had a terrific career brother Isaiah Moy as well and dont forget Ana aamu was the first rout pick as well the Atlanta Hawks having a terrific year at Atlanta six pick of the draft in 2020 Rob laner was fired after two years that was a surprise to a lot of people after him from 10 wins to 20 and Rob laner is a terrific guy and has had a wonderful career but that set off this crazy domino effect SMU hired Andy Enfield so then USC got Eric muselman out of Arkansas and then John Kerry went to Arkansas Mark pop to Kentucky Kevin young to BYU and uh quite a few of those schools I think youre feeling pretty good about The Hires they made today and smus in there yeah I know I think so but it it kind of starts with SMU making that move it opened the door for USC to pick up Eric Bulman in a year where theyre moving to the Big 10 Nick Cronin fit perfectly for that you know who knows what really works anymore I think every coach out there just wants some sense of stability some guidelines for how things are going to go and and from there at least you could build twoyear teams threeyear teams with a little bit of continuity I think the oneyear teams is going to be hard I really do I I think a lot of coaches are frustrated with that its hard to build anything its hard to make anybody better in a oneyear team you can get them some numbers but like it what is it glorified recess ball is it a ball or are we building something you know we we just had the send off last night for for Leonard Hamilton and while we put up all the numbers about the statistics and the things hes done and and the the wins hes had and all that thats all great what he cared most about was the 97 graduation rate Y and I think gosh what happened to that as part of the conversation now I I get the the value is there the money is there youve got to realize your value in this sport the players should be getting something but I think somewhere in the middle is where we should figure things out cant be so Music absolute another foul this one will go against cuff somehow nobodys F out of this game really want somebody to foul out dont you I I dont Im just shocked youre a big fan of the Left Right arent you of the left right yeah you know when someone fouls out Left Right sit down which is one of the Dumber thingses like someone out there come up with something different right something different he creat what about the na na na na hey hey goodbye Im not a fan of that one either Matt Bartley is producer extraordinaire what about just a hard see you like our friend Michael K does on Yankee H RS our friend huh yeah our friend colleague Michael K baseballs almost here you know were not ready for baseball quite yet we got some good college basketball get you still I got tball coming up with my fouryearold yeah big deal I volunteered as an assistant coach couldnt handle the responsibility of being the head coach is that why youre not the head coach you couldnt handle the responsibility or the town of Pitman New Jersey couldnt handle the responsibility you there was a circle it was either Circle a head coach or Circle assistant coach for darn sure Im not signing myself up for that level of responsibility with you know fiveyear olds youre hurting cats at that age thats about it yeah Im sure in a couple of years Ill call you and say why did I agree to her these cats cuff hits the free throws 70 to 53 and and the nfield can empty his bench here bringing Jackson Young Senior so smus going to move on to face Clemson and sometimes its great to get the madness in these tournaments like we got with NC State last year but sometimes its great to get the best teams were going to get the top eight seeds into the quarterfinals and right now well take a moment to say goodbye to Eddie lampy Jr college career that took him to TCU in Colorado where he made the NCAA tournament played really well gave Syracuse a lift down the stretch but his college career will come to an end here in Charlotte North Carolina look we spend a lot of time talking about the money and and Im sure a lot of these players you fight to get the money but the reality is this is a really special thing yeah were getting excited about some of these guys being able to get into the game for sure but the time you give and the time youre a part of these programs its something youll never forget and I will say the the more time you spend at one place and I say this is someone who transferred the more time you spend at one place the more special it is I was there for Clemsons senior day man that was he felt for it couple of WalkOns in there for Syracuse as well Noah Lobdell one of them guarding young right now you know the whole SMU bench wants young to shoot back Banker Flex on of Jackson look at the bch but you got to understand man these guys that are on the floor right now they work just as hard if not harder than everybody else all right this is this is more special than you know and the thing is the guys on the floor appreciate it because they understand how how committed these guys are why not a Off the Mark Nate Fleer the senior for Syracuse J Quan Carlos has just checked out of the Game decorated career at hopster hillend with Syracuse and the final seconds tick away smus unbeaten in the ACC tournament year one game one a 20po win the Mustangs pulled away from Syracuse and set up a Dandy of a matchup with Clemson tomorrow night yeah theyre going to have their hands full against Clemson I think its a tougher match up particularly the way they invert that big and Victor lockin out
