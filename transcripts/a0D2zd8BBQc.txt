one between Miami and SMU yigu and kid to get us started Bert Smith on the whistle today with Bill Covington Jr and Greg Evans and here is the star of the win on Wednesday night poopy Miller plays with Matt cross BJ Edwards and also Chuck Harris in the starting lineup that Andy enfields gone to here in the last couple of games with Harriss threepointer good to get the Mustangs going and the reason he put Harris into the starting lineup as he felt like they needed a spark at the start of the game and so there you go theres your spark at the start of the game of threepoint basket right out of the block kid the call for the ball against yigu at the Block and the big Fells battle left hand move and it falls off the iron and cross the rebound Miami feels like they need a good start here today Dan yes they sure do and they they need to be able to force some turnovers that need to be able to get out and run but particularly when ly kid gets the ball down there they need him to put it in the basket and yigu is a big man 7 feet2 thats going to be a tough match up ball out of bounds last Touch by the canes so boy Miller will put it in to Chuck Harris you got to find Harris he is a dangerous threepoint shooter Edwards out front with 13 to shoot heres cross who played 24 scoreless minutes the other night in Charlottesville but is on the board here at Coral Gable cross is a guy who recognizes Miss mismatches and takes the ball right at him that time Bea just couldnt handle him couldnt keep him from driving past Cleveland out front working against BJ Edwards heres Austin Schwarz Brandon Johnson transfer from East Carolina hard to the glass on the bounce in the basket for the Hurricanes well now west thats a good move but a very poor defensive play by SMU Johnson is 0 for 19 shooting the three in ACC play so why would you go for that fake and let him drive past you theres a l yigu the catch inside against kid and the big fellow scores 20yearold freshman from Istanbul averages nine points and almost seven rebounds a game for the Mustangs SMU and the manto man they play mostly manto man will play some Zone Cleveland on a hard drive to the basket and the scoop and score Matthew Cleveland who had only two points from the free throw line and took just three shots the other night well hes got obviously got to be very much more active than that for Miami to have any idea of success Matt Cross of course started his college career here at Miami then went to Louisville then to UMass and now at SMU and the rebound slapped around and Clevelands got it for the canes as I say Miller shoots under 30 from Beyond the threepoint Arc unless the clocks running down game absolutely people from Virginia saying where was that the other night look at kid go up and again thats a couple of shots hes taken two shots and those are shots he would normally make hard drive Harris on the window for his second field goal Chuck Harris has got five of the first nine here for the Mustangs Austin Schwarz in the lineup to handle the ball today they do have dine uku for the first time in about four ball games that ball last touched by Miller it will stay with Miami so into the lineup comes AJ ston McCrae and hes going to replace Bea for the canes so since Harris has five of the first nine and he had seven to the first nine the other night you would say that Andy Enfield strategy yeah of getting going early in the game with Harris is working yeah they put Johan tror on the bench inserted Harris and smus been much stronger with the start and Miami gets a second chance off the Miss here Cleveland against Edwards Schwarz out of the right corner and kid the rebound another crack at it great balance by ly kid I how he kept from falling down heres Brandon Johnson out front State McCrae Off the Bench knocks down a three 15th of the year for the transfer from Samford averaged almost seven the last three games coming off the bench for interim head coach Bill Courtney hes not a great threepoint shooter Wes only 28 from out there but they needed that one Miller Edwards at range or Harris rather at range Fall Away over State McRae and Miami had three guys around it nobody could hold on to it itll stay with SMU so the Mustangs lead the canes 97 here early as you see 50 fouryearold Bill Courtney from Alexandria Virginia the interim head coach thats Jim stepped down the day after Christmas here in Coral Gable yigu the catch and layup great catch West and he just laid it right in the basket no no wasted motion whatsoever so Matt had 10 and six the other night at Charlottesville averaging nine and seven he had 10 and 13 rebounds against Duke McCrae back R Music Miss and its a fourpoint SMU lead cross out of the corner a three ball from Matt cross hes got five you know damn prior to the scoreless 24 minutes the other night at Charlottesville hed been averaging 11 and N in three ACC games well Wes also prior to the other night he had eight straight games where he had eight rebounds or more that streak was broken against Virginia but he had cross is a really good player Schwarz against Millers pressure heres John joh Cleveland with six to shoot step back three at the front and yigu the rebound for SMU Wes theres not a lot of player movement on this Miami offense too much dribbling Edwards from Miller poopy on the Baseline now heres Edwards into traffic kick for cross Harris standing near the U knocks down the three Chuck Harris has got eight and the lead is quickly 10 for the Mustangs here in the first 5 and A2 minutes and cross had a wide open three and passed it up to a guy with a better Miami needs an answer its an eight nothing run now by SMU Cleveland tend to shoot and this is Johnson into traffic through a double team turned it over cross has it heres bopy Miller ski and catch three ball from Edwards good wow BJ Edwards a triple thats four of them for SMU and the lead is 13 they are eight of 10 from the floor and on 11 value in every game they play and the premium is also going to be there but theyre going to have opportunities West to get have some success to really improve their net and then they have games like this one where they got to really be careful so they dont shoot themselves in the foot they have to employ the Al Davis Theory West just win baby yep Paul Joe Bay on the flooor he wears number 10 for the canes thats Lynn kid at the post working on Johan trayor kid spins back with the left hand and Bill Covington Jr whistles the games first foul thats another tough matchup as trayor picks up the foul but its not as tough as the 7 foot2 yigu but one thing youll notice when the ball goes inside to LY Kidd SMU is not double teaming theyre going to play him oneonone in there they dont want to give up threepoint shots first free throw by kid is good he is 79 on the year Miami shoots 78 overall and just 72 in ACC play grad transfer start his career Clemson then Virginia Tech and now Miami hes got a pair of free throws W he averaged under two points a game his first season at Clemson wasnt much better than that his first season in Virginia Tech but blossomed into a really good player low post presence last year theres cross on the tap follow of the Miss by Harris Matt cross has got seven here mat he is a tremendous rebounder on both ends West you got to make sure you find him and block him out oach chuku hard drive and a flipping score Divine oach chuku The Freshman from Sugarland Texas whos missed the last two with injury important basket maybe to get him going a little bit in his return to the lineup for Bill Courtney cross inside tried to slide a bounce pass to trayor SMU is going to turn it over but you look at the Mustangs Dan you said earlier manto man for the most part little bit of Zone but they are all offense wow they are really good offensive team you can see those numbers right there and Andy Enfield hes got the reputation of having a tremendous mind for offensive basketball and nothing weve seen from SMU so far this season would give lie to that state sat McCrae this is Joe Bay huku and Schwarz who started the game at the point play together here in the sequence T to shoer Lin kid on the bouns trayor defends him with five kid got to do something hell turn with the left hand missed everything rebound pulled away o quindo Miller bounce pass trayor fouled by Kid and Johan hit the deck but I think his okay on the kid personal itll be his first and the First on Miami that was a hard foul Wes and the officials may take a look at this one and they are theyre going to take a look at that one to see if its a flagrant foul and the question will be the kid make a play on the ball it doesnt make a difference is under for the action on the B but if the contact is judged to be excessive or unnecessary Music so he comes down really hard and slaps him across the arm and he is basically in a vulnerable position trying to go up for the basket were almost 8 minutes into this first half SMU still rolling with that great start up 11 treor the foul from ly kid and after review Dan this officiating crew is assess kid with a flagrant one they have aess kid with a flagrant one weson that contact they ruled that contact was unnecessary and even though he was taking a swipe to get the ball he came nowhere close to the ball so they also decided that that wasnt really a legitimate attempt to play the ball there you go so its excessive contact not really a legitimate attempt to play the ball and ly kid goes to the bench and meanwhile Johan treor gets his first P well and trayor in that particular situation he was the guy whos filed so he shoots the free throw and since its a flagrant one its two its two shots and the ball mhm and Miami gives up an easy basket to Chuck Harris SMU is now 10 for 13 from the field west and Harris has got his fourth field goal hes double figures very quickly in the first eight minutes of the ball game huku plays with Schwarz Kyrie huy where is 15 for Miami hes coming to spell kid Paul Joe Bay on the floor as is State McCrae heres Joe Bay with a quick move in traffic tried to feed it to State McCrae last Touch by SMU 13 on the shot clock and heres Bea back into the ball game Wes weve talked about the SMU offense but their defense has been very solid today Miami just cant penetrate inside so oh good chuku spot throw in on the Baseline and again only 13 seconds very little time they went the lob look SMU covered that up and Endo the steel on the inbounds and cross puts the Mustangs in somewhat of a transition chance here well they want to get out and go back for bopy Miller trayor calling for it against huy cross a catch and shoot three is short and a rebound pulled down by state McCrae and Miami would like to push when they can West so SMU doing a nice job getting back oach chuku on the drive had it red out Terio endo and heres trayor circling underneath and gets the roll three points for Yan tror whos from tours in France and the lead is 16 now now for the Mustangs whove hit seven of their last nine and Miami looking for points for the first time in better than two minutes Joe Bay threw it up on the glass not close W youre not going to shoot a very high percentage when youre shooting shots like that a quindo a three got it and another Miami timeout 25th three of the year for a quindo opens the scoring and its a 19point lead on another 80 run to four in totality and its been driven a lot by the three ball five of their 12 field goals well they have done a pretty good job getting into the lane forcing the defense to collapse and then kicking it back out for threes and then theyre even more dangerous when theyre shooting those threes in transition yep left side heres Betha theyve got to get Cleveland and kid involved in this offense kid has shot the ball a couple times but they havent been good shots hes really good in a screen and roll situation they got to create some of those Joe Bay DS in his sixth three of the year he played 12 minutes the other night at Duke hes averaging about 14 a game and Paul joob Bay a sophomore from France who played his high school ball at West Oaks Academy and what a look that is to yigu for his third field goal Dan wow he saw bopy Miller saw he was being guarded by ly kid and threaded that pass through a series of arms twopoint goal for Jalil Bea The Freshman from Philadelphia and hes a guy with a reputation as somebody who can really put the ball in the basket theyre going to need some of that yep Miami drops back into his Zone boy SMU is cooking from behind the line arent they well theyre cooking from behind the line because theyre getting dribble penetration Dieu to skip it from Miller got deflected pull up two good for poopy Miller and thats the best part of bopy Millers game West attacking that basket getting to the goal or pulling up for that jump shot by the way thats his first point of the ball game its one of those things where hes already got four assists and you think hes impacted the game long before he scratches scoring wise Cleveland threw it away and another look here at bopy Millers delivery to yigu well Wes this what youre talking about he you know kid turns and goes and so Miller has a lane and he finds it somehow and then hes really good at this hes so quick with that dribble Matthew Cleveland cant stay with him and he gives himself just enough room yep to hit that pullup so here is Miller now with a quindo screened by Ambrose Hilton whos checked into the ball game he wears 22 in the red jersey he and yigu playing together Dan heres a quindo up strong against kid partially blocked Edwards recovers lobs and yigu sets it down SED has eight and smus gone the first nearly 12 minutes of the ball game theyve not missed consecutive field goal attempts yet in building what is a 20point lead Cleveland just above the foul line well you take that shot if youre Miami Cleveland is really good with that pullup jumper Miami back to the manto man there goes Miller hell skip it in the corner Edwards La for Ambrose Hilton to catch out of the corner Miller on the hard drive flipped it up over the top of kid yigu couldnt tap it back Ambrose Hilton finally follows it home thats a tremendous size advantage on the interior for SM you and that means Ambrose Hilton has to guard a smaller guy but Miami hasnt been able to take advantage of such a mismatch 22point lead s and a half to play in the first here in Coral gaes you get too is doing a great job making kid catch the ball a little further away from the basket than he wants to five to shoot long three by Schwarz no good Ambrose Hilton the rebound outlet for Miller back for a quendo who thought about it and it looks like Paris stepped out of bounds thatll get us to a timeout SMU in control by 22 and C yigu off the nice lob sets it down Yus got eight SMU leads by 22 as you say the day after Christmas he was named the in top and theres a turnover by Miami thatll be number four on Courtneys canes here in the first half but Wes when you come right down to it uh you know if it wasnt for bad luck Miami wouldnt have had any luck at all since their final four run last year they played 12 of their 20 ACC games with at least one starter out in some cases more than one and theyve been riddled with injuries again this year theres a catch and a score Ambrose Hilton on the board for the second time in this first half and now the lead is up to 24 and Miami has you know as an illustration they us seven different starting lineups this year Bea fallway on the Baseline is good boy what a pretty move Jalil Bea thats his second field goal o quindo tees up another three and Cario has no problems if you give him a window he will jump right through it well and hes very aggressive about it one of the more aggressive offensive players in this league hes always looking for his opportunity he as his third School in three years started Georgia went to Oregon now at SMU and he is a factor offensively and to his credit hes also been part of the defensive prowess they shown again Wes on this particular possession yigu does a great job forcing kid to catch the ball a few feet off the lane so by the time kid gets three or four dribbles and gets closer its too late yeah you see where Miami is defensively in addition to the inconsistencies theyve had today at the offensive end defenses been more of a focal point theres a long three attempted by Brandon Johnson who is now 0 for 20 from three in ACC play quindo collected on the deflection by Harris a quindo from the U Back Rim Miss and Edwards had a crack at it last F touched by Bea and thatll get Matthew Cleveland back into the lineup for Miami and Jalil beo will sit down for Coach Courtney and the canes well Wes its not all on Matthew Cleveland thats not at all what I mean to say here but if Miami is going to have any success at all Matthew Cleveland has to perform on both ends of the Court Miller out front straightway three good for poopy Miller hes got five now now when you give him a chance to set his feet like that Wes thats when hes most dangerous shooting the three and how about that the spin on that ball it was like a knuckle ball going up there yep Joe Bay boy Miami really fighting it now six straight by the Mustangs four their last five from the floor Joe Bay tries to get something on the glass cannot J Jerel Colbert by the way in the game and theres a lobin at the other end Edwards lays it in five for BJ Edwards and the canes went 94 ft sparked by the rebound off the glass by Colbert uh you know as I say I think Lyn Kidd is one of the better operators in this conference in uh screen and roll situation but we have not seen that their run if you want to take it all the way back is 376 in this first half well again theres Schwarz and of course Miami is playing right at the moment without a point guard but Schwarz just too much dribbling yep Cleveland almost had it picked Edwards then had it deflected by Colberg and Greg Evans will take the whistle and say it belongs to SMU Wes if youre going to get if youre going to have any offensive consistency at all you need ball movement you need player movement and the easiest thing for a defense to guard is some guy whos just dribbling the ball on the drive the scoop and the score is good for poopy Miller unless that guy dribbling the ball is going to go right past you and if youre going to dribble the ball thats what you have to do you have to go somewhere the Mustangs are a point off their best first half of the year with four minutes to go and theyve got 50 W they only scored 54 the other night in the whole game against Virginia turned over Ambrose Hilton Colbert Schwarz will run down in the corner and recover it for Miami thats great Hustle by Schwarz sure is 10 nothing run 182 total here for Coach infields Club entry pass stolen away Edwards ahead for Miller and here are the Mustangs again a lob and a catch Colbert and a score jell Colberts first points number one he did a great job running the Court West and the second thing is he did a good job not trying to dunk that thing in with an offbalance play he caught the ball went right back up and theres a foul for it but Andy Enfield in his first year at SMU has really done a nice job this is a very interesting team and a ball thrown away oach chuku I think was trying to bounce it inside nobody home heres Miller the turnover now cross and a quick hitter for Endo who had it roll out and then Brandon Johnson lost it over the in line Andy infield of course 55 years of age first year in Dallas hes 13 and four its his 14th year as a head coach Florida G coast of course Southern California hes 274 and 179 I thought a smart hire by Rick har I think so too I think so too Wes I mean Andy Enfield you know when we first met him he was like the shot doctor at Florida State teaching them how to shoot free throws no problem with shooting here by the way they worked it worked by absolutely absolutely it did but Andy enford was a great college basketball player at Johns Hopkins who scored a lot of points so when he talks about shooting he knows what hes talking about yep Brandon Johnson long three cant buy one a quendo the rebound Mustangs have set a new high for first quarter scoring in this opening 20 minutes and heres yigu going to work on kid and thatll be Lyn kids second foul itll be the second on Miami couple of free throws coming for CET yigu quicker reminder to you super Tuesday number 15 Mississippi State number 6 Tennessee at 700 on ESPN 2 then at 900 from Winston Salem on ESPN Carolina and Wake Forest deacons by the way leading at blackburg this afternoon tar Hills and Stanford Cardinal underway in the ACC at Chapel Hill and a dribble Drive score for boy Miller hes got nine in the first half 56 to8 18 Dan wow its real and at one point this score the score was 9 to seven thats it Kyrie huy trying to get some position against yatu back to Schwarz got deflected keeps it with 12 to shoot Cleveland thought about the three step in two is good second field goal for Matthew Cleveland W that Miami needed that obviously but when that ball went inside the Huey everybody just stood there and watched nobody cut nobody tried to get in position and they were fortunate not to have a turnover Harris working against ston McCrae Bo what a good start Chuck Harris had to the Ball Game and it continues hes now got a dozen in the first half he leads SMU in points lead 38 for the Mustangs and theres schwarzs answer its a twopointer for Austin schwarzs first basket its good to get the ball down the court and try to get the shot up before SMU can set its defense Miller heres yigu again Kyrie huie defending the big freshman from Turkey strong to the basket 10 points for cat yigu and strong is the word for that West he just muscled his way past Wes theyve got 60 points yep sure do and a 38point lead again there goes Johnson Schwarz by Miller and try to get it to huie through traffic and Kyrie huy gets his first point as a Miami Hurricane huy on the board he didnt play this season missed the first 16 games recovering from a hand injury after he transferred from Idaho State he averaged 11 points and a half dozen rebounds a year ago for the Bengals and the Mustangs are going to hold here for the last shot of the half Miller threw it away heres Brandon Johnson with five Runner and alow for the Cleveland Music dunk and thatll be the end of the half GE Tech and Miami in the last two first halves on a Saturday in the ACC 110 45 good Dan and it was funny because Andy infield almost kind of summarized a little bit of what they did last Saturday against Georgia Tech coming off the Carolina lost Dan when they put Chuck Harris in the lineup we needed more offensive punch well theyve gotten it well specifically he needed more offensive punch to start the game yeah and a miss three by Johnson Tapped Out Last by Miami says Bill cumington Jr and theres a look at Harris the young man from Ashburn Virginia who transferred in from Butler that was that was the best ball movement and player movement that Miamis had for a while yep and and over the inline out of bounds last Touch by Cleveland well you get told who just got tangled up inside there that was Miller trying to get him I think Cleveland tipped it away so heres Miller 15 to shoot for the Mustangs theres Harris in the catch gets Betha cross out fronts been relatively quiet had nine in the first half this is Harris on a reroute threw it up and yigu stuffs it home hes got a dozen and thats been part of the problem for the Miami defense the guards for SMU have been able to penetrate past their Defenders and get into the lane and create those kinds of opportunities Cleveland on the drive and samat yigu draws the foul itll be his first first of the half on Andy infields Club one of the principles of Defense first principes you got to keep your guy in front end Johnson didnt do that nice job by Harris to get by no help inside and if you leave a 72 guy that close to the basket thats going to happen Matthew Cleveland to the free throw line 73 on the year has seven in the ball game now he had only two points the other night in Durham he had had six straight in double figures including 22 last Saturday against Wake Forest before seeing that streak snapped on Wednesday or Tuesday night rather at camer now Cleveland is just a really good player and now when youre playing against Duke and SMU today youre playing against two really good teams Miller trying to elude a double team with Johnson and Schwarz here is Harris that three got blocked by Cleveland scooped up Brandon Johnson back for Cleveland out front hell take it down score and draw the foul from Harris thats great play by Cleveland on both ends of the Court Wes yep best sequence weve seen from Miami at both ends Dan in this ball game well they came out with some pressure theyre trying to change the tempo and thats a nice job by Cleveland to block that shot without fouling and then he does a nice job getting down the court taking the contact and still score 10 for Cleveland make it 11 with the free throw he leads Miami in scoring in fact hes the only guy in double figures and the only guy with more than four out of the corner Miller drains the three a dozen now for boy Miller thats his second triple of the afternoon and again he got a chance to get his feet set Wes and when hes ready like that theres and a foul called bit of a push here this is what uh Miller usually does get into gets into Lane and pitches it out but when Miller gets a chance to get set like that and has some time to shoot that three he is a much better than 29 threepoint shooter yigu drew the foul his second third of the half on SMU who only had two in the opening 20 minutes there were only four fouls called in the first half tend to shoot for Brandon Johnson follow away is too strong BJ Edwards the rebound hell pitch it ahead Harris the catch almost traveled with it Crow thought he did you cant travel unless you possess it and Miller lobs to treor for another dunk five now for Johan treor West were liking Groundhog Day here this same thing keeps happening over and over again yeah the dribble drop penetration dance been way too easy for SMU they got plenty of conversion Ops on the back end but they have missed and the follow I think Clevelands going to get called for a push off Cleveland going to be ticketed with the foul itll be his first its the first of the half on Miami Wesson do you know who went flying out of bounds after Cleveland pushed him it was poopy Miller so with all the other stuff he does he got in the way of Matthew Cleveland and prevented him from getting that offensive rebound cross will put it in play to Miller almost three minutes gone now in this second half double team pressure heres Miller skipping it across cross lines up a three Matt crosss second triple of the afternoon he has a dozen now Wes if youre going to trap there you either have to steal the ball or you have to make the guy stop dribbling if you let the guy dribble out youre in trouble its a twopointer for Austin Schwarz its his second basket comes in averaging six and a drive on the endline turned over and out of bounds by Miller and another look at Matt cross on the catch and shoot now Miller gets him the ball after penetration and its just There He Go you see four players around Miller trying to stop his drive and theres nobody there to defend cross SMU with three minutes gone second half still has not missed consecutive field goal attempts today theyre getting great shots and even when you great get great shots its hard to have a run like theyve had Betha off a kid screen toward the corner heres Joe Bay Off the Bench for Bill Courtney now kid the catch backs down on cross double team help from trayor leftand move and a foul will be called on U and its going to be on Cross first on the senior transfer from Beverly Mass on a team Miami that has been struggling on offense ly kid still doesnt have a field goal yep just a couple of free throws for kid who will go back to the line this is his 102nd career game and if you take his last 50 Dan okay which is the two years at Virginia Tech in the first 17 of Miami career hes averaging 12 and 1 12 points almost seven rebounds West last year he was number four in the NCA and field goal percentage thats correct 65 a half in the ACC by the way well and he can operate around the basket but today I think hes really been bothered by the SMU size yep and he got one or two there so hes got three in the ball game I think your point earlier about kid is you know he only played those seven games his first year at Clemson he played 77 of them at Virginia Tech what a difference it made a year ago for him 116 rebounds in conference let alone the field goal Dage on the drive o quendo turns it over well didnt he have the highest increase in scoring average in the conference last year yeah exactly he and Ian chef somewhere right there neck and neck three ball from Cleveland rattled out crossing the Mustangs as they have all afternoon pressing the issue offensively and look at the score on the drive by Edwards when you miss a three you generally get a long rebound and SMU theyre just not hesitating at all theyre getting it and theyre going and of course thats what the Mustangs want to do they want to get out and go dine oach chuku into the ball game wheres 99 for the canes heres Cleveland working on a quindo boy pretty physical on the perimeter there heres Jo bay kick out for Cleveland shot fake launches and with the shot clock going down Joe Bay the offensive rebound kid will give Miami a third try bounces for Cleveland and he cant score it but draws the foul from cross two on Matt cross here in the second half five on the Mustangs I thought would really damage Louis but has given Scott an opportunity and hes taken advantage boy look at this last two seasons they won 12 games today was win 14 for the cards who are now seven and one in the ACC play Clemson is a winner as well they won an overtime game just the second conference game in the ACC to go to overtime heres a backourt steel with pressure Cleveland the F basket and draws the foul from Toc gner so Matthew Cleveland has come with a little more assertiveness here in the second 20 minutes well again the pressure by Miami creates a turnover and you know if Miami can create turnovers and get down and get easy shots to help their halfcourt offense I mean they theyre not bad offensively West theyve been today but they have some capable scores eight and a half for Cleveland make it nine hes got 15 in the ball game Music and front Court comes gorner young man also from Turkey hes a senior transfer from San Jose State started his career at Arizona back in 2021 they brought gner in to shoot threes and he hadnt really shot the three very well so far this year and turned over heres Joe Bay baa with Cleveland kid and heres oach chuku Cleveland on the drive the scoop with the right hand off the glass it in West we talked earli in the game about how Miami was trying those drives to the basket well once you move the ball from side to side a couple times shift times and shift the defense around that drive is much easier gner a three hit the front rim kid for Jo Bay Cleveland ahead the lob and the layup fell off and he draws a foul Matthew Cleveland he has been get a couple free throws here and the foul again on Toc gner and theyre going to score the basket and theyre going to review it I think first well previous play is under review for goal T Wes you can review the play as long as you call it a goal tend and the reason theyre reviewing it now rather than waiting for the next media timeout is because it determines how many free throws there will be its either if its not goal tending its two if it is its an and one after just two fouls in the first half smus now committed seven here with just 6 minutes and 10 seconds gone in half two a lot of free throws left to go now Wes if you grab the rim while the ball if you grab the net while the ball is on the rim that is one of the things that could be goal T after review the call on the floor will stand at goal tending the ball was interfered with while it was on the rim good basket Miami will shoot one free though so Cleveland will get an n one out of this an eight nothing run by the canes seventh field goal of the afternoon for Matthew Cleveland hes had quite a second half now 13 in the half chance to make it 14 if he can score this if you tug on the net while the ball is on the rim and it affects the referees can rule that affects the shot and obviously it did and the free throw good Cleveland is now six for seven at the free throw line well the Hurricanes havent packed it in Wes nope theyve been very aggressive with this defense after his rugged an opening 20 minutes as anybody could survive through Miami come out here with a little more polish to what theyre doing really at both ends of the floor yes well you know when youre getting easier opportunities your offense looks a little better out front is Edwards off of yigao screen back to the big fella and he draws the foul going to the basket couple of free throws for CET on Matthew Cleveland second personal itll be the second on Miami you know its 7 foot2 he sets that screen and rolls to the basket and that leaves ly kid up near the top of the key and there just anybody there isnt anybody big enough to even contest him Yu will have two here Music and the first one is short dont forget it all comes down to Monday night college football playoff national championship game presented by ATT 730 from MercedesBenz stadium in Atlanta number eight Ohio State number seven Notre Dame coverage on ESPN at 730 eastern time and one of the two good for Yuga TOA he shoots a lot of free throws Wes unfortunately hes under 60 for the year oach chuku on the drive blocked by Au quendo Miller coming the other way Edwards one dribble cross standing alone knocks down the three W he actually fumbled that catch but he had all the Time in the World to receip the ball and fire yep nobody around it quite frankly Cleveland against Miller into traffic Joe Bay thought about the three right hand Runner and yigu the rebound Miller for cross again hell launch back rim Miss and last touch gorner and the ball will be awarded to Miami to Beck gorner from Turkey arrived in the United States at age 16 from Istanbul 21 season at Arizona last year at San Jose State 11 points four rebounds Dan hes hit 174 career threes yeah but only four this year Weston in a game like this Andy Enfield would really like to get him going a little bit yep you know gner is one of those guys you know hes made so many threes if he just get a couple to go in the basket then that might change the whole deal hes also a guy that has the longer the season goes for SMU his value to shoot the basketball increases yes Divine uku at the free throw line front end of the one and one is good uku 59 on the year seeing his first action in the last three games missed the last two with injury and again the injury bug has been has been bad for Miami yep and the second and that allows him to set the pressure and Bert Smith little game management here on the shot clock well the shot clock didnt start so Bert decided three seconds have it lapsed so here we go again yep Miller working against oach chuku gatu blocked Away by Kid recovered CET tried to dunk it home going to draw the Applause foul and it is on Matthew Cleveland third on Cleveland of the half third in the Ball Game Y too had a handed the ball off and just cut right to the basket and the defense was a little behind him by the way SMU just missed consecutive field goals for the first time well does that count if he got fouled oh was on the Block on the Block okay all right yolu by the way in one preseason publication was listed as a developmental player I think hes passed on that uh whats he developing now well I mean amazingly at 20 years of age he has already played professional basketball in Macedonia and the Adriatic League i had no idea by the way there was an Adriatic league but there are leagues everywhere West yeah but maybe more importantly Dan he was an under 20 player for turkey in the Euros the hill for what amounts to a homecoming game for Newport main freshman Cooper flag who as you see leads his teams in all five core statistical categories thats just ridiculous for a freshman inside heres Miller hell be fouled on the pump fake by oguk first on Divine and the fourth on the Kings and we weve talked about Cooper flly again you watch him on television you think boy that guys really good and then you see him in person and what you see on television isnt anywhere close to as good as he is right Ive shared that sentiment with a couple different people and they look go like what do you mean and I said well for instance he takes the ball off the glass and in two dribbles sees the floor its just an amazing gift and what a talented kid he is now the other night in Durham Cory Alexander shared a story after talking with some of Coopers family Miller hits the free throw four and the half 13 in the game that some of the flag friends and family for tonights game at Boston bought season tickets to BC to ensure they would get this game wow so the uh and as you and I both know Duke games in Boston always have a strong Duke presence absolutely tonight might be bigger than those 800 tonight on ESPN flag in the Blue Devils against Earl Grants Eagles inside and heres kid out of trouble and now we get a we got a shot clock situation yep I think so theyre going to there it is it should not have reset to 30 it should reset to 20 so there you have it Lin kid still does not have a field goal right he had the ball underneath the basket there there after that rebound and normally he would power that right back up but he actually went away from the basket yiga was right there in his pocket IGA was a big man yep heres Schwarz to put it in play with Cleveland who has been Miamis offense here in the second half 34 the difference here with just better than 11 to play boy Brandon Johnson a little Up and Under and second field goal for Brandon Johnson from Roseville High School outside of Raleigh transferred from East Carolina where started 31 games this season too and average 14 points of contest Miami has played better in this half because their defense has been better a quendo right corner Miller all alone back rim Miss of the Three cross will give him another crack how about bopy again sure you bet boopy Miller now with three threes in the game 16 in the game and its 8247 Wes Miller came into this game with a total of six threes in ACC play Oh quendo with the Applause windmill eight for Cario acendo and that one had a little flare to it well hes a guy I think who likes a little flare oh man does he ston McCrae and the rebound for Miller transition chance for SMU Edwards for cross halfway home and half two o quindo heres Miller on the attack all the way down blocked by Schwarz itll stay with SMU with 13 to shoot and another look at the Highlight play from Caro quindo well quindo we said is a really good offensive player and he enjoys when he gets the ball he likes to attack heres Miller out of the corner thats Edwards and its good wow BJ Edwards is second three of the game hes into double figures with 10 he doesnt shoot a high volume Edwards but he a very good threepoint shooter and now a steel heres a quendo working on Cleveland spinning through traffic hell draw the Miami foul and more free throws I think no well get a out of bounds and its Brandon Johnson its his first its five on Miami Wes that was a harder play by oquindo than it looked because he was off balance he had to catch that ball get himself stopped without traveling and then taking it to the basket Tero quindo has only had one double figure game in his last seven hes got nine the first time they played Virginia this year remember SMU has now swept the Cavaliers and thats the first time anybody swept Virginia since the 2019 season a quo had 21 in the game in Dallas the other night not as successful but hes back to double figures now for a second time in the last eight games and theres a steal by Miller from Schwarz and Boops going to punch it how about you boopy Miller boopy Miller stared at the bench as if somebody over there might have doubted him on his team well hes only 6 feet tall thats what they list him at Im not sure hes that tall nine to play 9147 State McCrae shot clock winding down and AJ State mccraes got five on his second field goal out of the corner a quendo yigao the rebound quickly back for K quendo crossed through traffic and rejected by Kyrie Hui therell be a foul on huie itll be his first Dan so poy Miller I mean he just waits for his chance steals the ball and this is a six foot tall guy who dunks it watch the reaction of the bench look at that and then stares at the bench as if to say do you doubt me so were going to get a break here theyre going to review and I think what the review is is to see if this was goal tended by Miami in particular Matt cross will go to the line to shoot a couple of free throws no goal tend on the play so just a foul cross hits the the first we Andy infield of course coached at Southern California through last season won 220 games out there and we were talking with him earlier today just about people he knows that were impacted and like all of us the devastation the video when you see the devastation shocking it is shocking its just shocking yep cross hit a couple of free throws hes subbed out so Edwards with Colbert Keon Ambrose Hilton has come on the floor with quendo and also Chuck Harris and BJ Edwards out there right now by the way bopy Miller has got his first double double of the year today for SMU State McCrae a shot fake Cleveland with six to shoot and thatll fall off the front rim and Ambrose Hilton gathers the rebound Clevelands got 20 and nobody else for Miami has more than five yep and Miami they got it going a little bit early in the second half when they stopped turning the ball over but theyve had a rash of turnovers here recently and that has allowed SMU to Spur out again quendo wants some help Harris into the corner Ambrose Hilton going to launch hit the side of the glass hes now three for 11 from behind the line this year and theres Cleveland at the other end and another and one for Matthew Cleveland whats that three for him in this half it yep Clevelands now got 16 in the half and the foul on CH Harris and and again when youre when you take a threepoint shot that misses that badly it gives your opponent a chance to get out and go and thats where Miami thats what they want to do they just havent had a lot of opportunities to do that today and Cleveland hits the free throw hes now seven out of eight at the free throw line hes had quite a second half hes got 17 and a half Dan 23 in the ball game and the Mustangs score easily at the other end thats a risk that you take when you pressure West you double team that leaves somebody open and Ambrose Hilton really took advantage of that Music one kick out three Johnson from deep and the rebound for Harris with seven minutes to go its a 43point lead for the Mustangs Ambrose Hilton with the right hand off the window hes a trans for from Alabama from Toronto yeah Wes but he was actually on the team at SMU last year he one of the three guys that elected to stay and his minutes have picked up recently oh guku knocks down the triple second three of the year for Devine uku Ambrose Hilton was asking for a lob they didnt see him in the corner aqu quendo knocks down the three Terio aindo now 7 and a half 13 in the ball game and the senty mark for SMU with six minutes to go six minutes left in the game and Brandon Johnson finally hits a three thats his first three in ACC play Bri ball missed by Harris and what did Bill Courtney tell us about Johnson before the game that he makes threes in practice all the time and he feels like if he just can get a couple to go in the game then the the the Dyke is going to burst cobbert going to be called for the foul 10 on SMU and you see the most 100 point games in a season 9293 those are the days of John shoemate coaching the Mustangs uh not to be confused with the days prior to that where John conak played for SMU and Dave Bliss was coach five of the 100o games this year for Andy infield the amazing thing there Wes is their top is six and 93 and then five this year and their fours are back in the 70s isnt it amazing people could score 100 points Y without the threepoint line or the shot clock and here are the numbers that back up their prow Dan well and theres not one of those numbers thats going to suffer from the performance that theyve had today mhm I mean this has just been a clinic of offensive basketball for the most part now that stretch there early in the second half where SMU turned it over and allowed Miami to get out and go a little bit thats one of the things thatll make Andy Enfield happy because his guys wont have done everything well five and a half to go in a 40point game Harris toet gner drops a three and much like Johnson for Miami theyre waiting for gner to get going and again Wes how many times have we seen that penetrate in the lane the defense collapses they get out and get a three huey on the drive and eludes Colbert and were going to get a foul called on gner going be the third on the senior and a couple of free throws for Miami with 508 to play dont forget tomorrow on 8 c network its a womens basketball quadruple header Boston College host Syracuse to get the afternoon started and then number 14 North Carolina visits Pittsburgh Louisville is at Virginia Tech and Neil iy and dangerous number three Notre Dame host SMU thats a quadruple header on acc Network also streaming live for you on the ESPN app and one of the free throws for hu hes got Music five and its a 42point game trayor right hand score six now for Johan trayor and thats its really tough you cant help out against a guy like trayor because theyve been kicking it out and knocking down threes all all game long Cleveland at the top left side state McCrae now Miami has oh excuse me SMU has made 14 threepoint baskets today I dont care how well you play its hard to beat somebody that makes 143 kid reverses two times and finally scores his first field goal of the day Dan its just its going to be tough for Miami you know Lin kid doesnt have to score 20 points every game but when you get down to the 4minute mark and he scores his first field goal thats a game theyre going to have a tough time winning oh what a tip follow AJ George I believe yes that was George yep on the board just his seventh field goal of the year for the Junior from Fresno who played at Long Beach State a year ago Andy anfield talked about him this morning too that hes a really good player George who just hasnt had a chance to play very much because of the SMU depth yep and Cleveland is uh got a season high and thatll get us to to a break 335 to go in the game really tailed off they only shot 62 in the second half and heres Chuck Harris who started off like he might go for 40 today and hes this is his first point in the second half Dan hes got 13 but Wes thats his job his job is to get him going early and he did 108 to 65 you know back in the 60s and early 70s the old Dallas Chapparal out of the ABA used to play at Moody Coliseum Im sure they came over here to tangle with the old Miami Floridians a time or two and this is like an old ABA game when you look at the point total for SMU and theres a Up and Under reverse for Cleveland hes working on a career high now 27 for Cleveland on 10 of 16 shooting and the majority of that coming in the second half yep all but six of it gorner on the bounce cobbert to work with the left hand trayor the recovery and he left it short Isaiah or beg your pardon Yousef Bama the transfer from Yale on the floor for Miami just this sixth appearance of the year and you see George steal the ball from State McCrae and AJ George Will score off the deflections just like they draw it up yeah just to keep in practice and the Enfield still yelling at the referee and Cleveland has got another basket and heres Harris back door look cobbert the catch and fouled by basama and a quick reminder to you super Tuesday basketball for you on the ESPN family of networks will start you in Knoxville number six Tennessee and number 15 Mississippi State at 7 and then on ESPN at 900 Tuesday night the tar Hills and deacons at Joel Coliseum and the free throw by culbert good and you see Keon Ambrose Hilton checking to the lineup Chuck Harris has come out not often West do you see 112 points nope with two and A2 minutes left in regulation and four now for Colbert Cleveland has 23 in the second half Dan 2 9 in the game Miami has only 20 from other players beside the 23 from Matthew Cleveland wow by the way the canes are headed to California next week Wednesday at Stanford Saturday at cow here is Cleveland on the drive State McCrae the three itll Bound Away and uku with a reset of the shot clock as we go inside of two statan McCrae on the drive and a whistle and a foul will be called I think this is on Jerell cobbert itll be his second couple of free throws for AJ State and McCrae this is the most points for Southern Methodist University in a road game ever wow and we are looking at a Mustang basketball history that started 1916 heres AJ ston McCrae and the first of the free throws no good just his 21st attempt of the year had 10 points last Saturday against Wake Forest he been coming off the bench now the last four ball games for Bill Music Courtney I thought we might see some things today Dan I didnt think wed see 43 as a difference well or and I dont think you thought wed see 113 nope but the Mustangs have been lethal George trying to find a crease inside Ambrose Hilton all the way under the basket comes out on the spin and scores against ysf bash well weson remember Miami only had 26 in the first half so theyve played much better on the offensive end in the second but they havent had any answer for SMU down low heres Lynn kid to work with the right hand hell score second field goal for kid seven in the ball game five and a half and thats what were used to seeing from Lyn kid but I thought Yus size really bothered him early they led by 34 at the half and its 115 to 72 as AJ George gets into traffic and he get the an one roll and the foul is on state McCrae and AJ George in his 10th Game of the Year a chance to complete a threepoint trip and here comes Trey uter and Jackson young into the ball game for the Mustangs well so the game must be over youre putting in your WalkOns who have mustaches yep so utter is a 6foot Junior from argal Texas whos playing for the first time in the last 16 games he played one minute against Florida AM and Jackson young is from Metropolitan cville Texas as Georges free throw spins out he did not play at Virginia he played a minute last week this will be his fourth game against the ACC this year and his fifth on the year ston McCrae spin out of the three Cleveland tried to follow we get a whistle and a foul its on AJ George so Matthew Cleveland whos already got a career high 29 a chance to add to it here in the final half minute well his hes really been active and aggressive in the second half yep and Andy infield has already told his team no shots when they get the ball back here Cleveland the first one well in many ways Dan you feel for Bill Courtney this is a difficult situation that is seemingly getting more difficult by the game yes absolutely without any question now theres a tenth of a second difference between the shot clock and the game clock so well get a buzzer and then well have to throw it in bounds again yeah by the way 117 is going to be the sixth most points scored in a game ever by SMU wow and thats going to be the final here today 17 74 well there you go they just they just let it go nice 43 points the difference and the Mustangs score the most points since they scored 127 against James Madison
