all seven and one in league play coming off a win last Saturday at Georgia Tech Theyve been idle since Took Monday off because of the ice storm And so they are back in action against a Pittsburgh team coming off a win Tuesday in overtime when they beat Wake Forest Panthers on defense first with their blue uniforms Clemson with the home whites They go inside to the big man number 22 Carter Welling And the junior from Draper Utah has us underway I love Carter Welling his ability to go inside and use his length effectively on both sides of the floor Its a huge factor why Tigers are the number two ranked defense in the ACC And again this afternoon Jeff Cable will have his leading scoreer Brandon Cummings coming off the bench Demarco Miner at the point This is Omari Witherspoon The gamewinning shot in overtime the other day against Wake Forest an emerging freshman And a reachin foul as Barry Dunning Jr carved his way along the baseline Hey Perry Dunning Jr is a star This guy goes 66 195 pounds Hes got 21 blocks He leads the team but he can put the ball on the floor and create his own shot at any point in time that he wants Barry Dunning Jr senior from Mobile Alabama shooting two Hes been one of the big additions this year for Jeff Cable III and his staff in year number eight And Dunning has delivered to the tune of 12 points five rebounds per game and he can put up points Last February when he was playing at South Alabama he scored 46 points against Texas State He gets one out of two The ball back tapped all the way to the back court Tracked down by Demarco nicknamed Polo Miner Miners another one of the newcomers for Pit this year who has done very well A senior from Allen Texas Corin lost the ball out of bounds but he will keep it Last to touch Clemson Yeah And thats what Corin can do right all the way out above the threepoint line He is looking to be in attack mode He wants to take the fight right to this Tigers defense Minor check by Justin Porter And heres Corin Shot clock down to seven Witherspoon picked up his dribble in a bit of trouble Gets it back from Corin He fires for three And the Panthers still looking for their first bucket of the afternoon Excellent backs out that time by RJ Godfrey trying to keep Roman Ceppa off that offensive glass The kids got 24 offensive rebounds in his last three basketball games Thats a average of eight a game Thats unheard of Thats pretty good Same starting lineup now for 10 straight games for Brad Brownell This is a balanced Clemson team They dont have a true star They dont have a guy They may not even have an all ACC player at the end of the day and they could win the regular season in the Atlantic Coast Conference I like that you got a bunch of uh dogs out there that just love playing hard for one another Youre right The main guy averages 12 points a game And there is the leader Dylan Hunter He and RJ Godfrey are the veterans on this team Hunter is a fouryear Clemson Tiger who sets the tone Yeah Dont be surprised if Tigers start a little slow Theres a live ball turnover Goes Roman Ceppa to the other end And the Panthers take the early lead 32 Roman Caleeppa the freshman from Brisbane Australia who has been on quite a role as youre talking about Scott Yeah he hes a rugby player He was the number one rugby player in Australia coming out of high school and a guy decided to put on a pair of high tops and play basketball for the Pit Tiger Panthers And this is really the first time in Caleppas young life that he has focused on basketball He had split time in Australia between rugby as you mentioned and basketball And so over the last couple of months hes gotten himself in better shape Hes gotten a better feel for what the Panthers are doing in basketball And the numbers have just exploded Yeah you see the last three games uh three double double I mentioned the 24 offensive rebounds He had 15 points and 15 rebounds last game out Coach Cable says he was the last one to arrive on campus and wasnt in good basketball conditioning Now he is finding himself in good conditioning actually great conditioning and is being so much more effective on the floor RJ Godfrey with a quick footwork and he is fouled A blocking foul will send number zero to the free throw line Well you can see the physicality of RJ Godfrey 672 240 The senior from Sani Georgia is back And heres the matchup we were looking for Corin trying to stay in front Yeah Flashing the footwork that time Spun off of Corin And Corin cannot get in foul trouble In fact thats what coach Cable said against this big uh Tigers defense or offensive attack He cannot get in foul trouble because they dont have the size all the way to match up with all the bigs that the Tigers have Well we have the two longest tenur head coaches in the ACC in this game Brad Brownell year number 16 is the longest and he has had his way with Pittsburgh over the years He is 142 all time at Clemson playing Pittsburgh And actually in this matchup he and coach Cable go back to their days coaching in the Ca when Brownell was at UNCW and Coach Cable was at VCU And the numbers its incredible Brad Brownell lifetime against Jeff Cable is 16 and three Yeah Whos your daddy Wow that thats some numbers right there He has taken it to the woodshed Brad uh coach Bradell looking for his 200th home victory here for the Tigers to win tonight Under five to shoot Witherspoon traveled Clemson defensively rock solid to begin the ball game Yeah both teams going to start a little cold right Its cold outside Its a little cold in here Clemson their last time out they had to have a buzzer beat or three to get a uh a single possession advantage at Georgia Tech and then they went on and got on a 164 run to start the second half I dont know if theyll wait to the second half here at home but um the runs for Clemson when they come they come in a bunch Nick Davidson tries to get to the left hand missed the shot off the window and theres a rebound for Caleppa I like the fact that both teams are going inside for for buckets Youre struggling from the outside You got to attack the basket See Alpa from the corner Air ball long cheering Fans are going to let him know about that Yeah that threepoint shot still a work in progress He can knock him down but hes a streaky threepoint shooter If hes missing early he generally misses for the rest of the game Yeah streaky is right Going into the Penn State game back on December 21st he was only three of 20 from deep And in that game against the Nitney Lions Caleppa was five for six so he can make them Just isnt doing it consistently yet Yeah itll come Hes still young Heres Corin Little too strong Sele has a knack for offensive rebounding Hes got his first here this afternoon Slow start at Little John Tied at three early keeping this thing humming And uh at least they get to keep the basketball floor down for the womens game tomorrow A little easier night hopefully tonight We get a little night off But I thank those guys because we get to do basketball because they put in all that hard work And I tell you what its been a little chilly to start so far Just one of five shooting for the Tigers and one of four for the Panthers So hopefully one of these teams will will heat up as we got Davidson and Caleppa down there wrestling on the block and theyre going to get a foul on Roman Caleppa Is that his second Yeah that is his second on the other side Jake Wallens got two fouls as well I also want to mention the facilities crew here Because of all the ice last week and then the snow that is coming down now they have had to deal with laying down salt and moving ice and moving snow So they have been extremely busy and continue to do it And I got to say considering the fact that theyre forecasting 4 to 6 in today of snow which they dont get here that may as well be 4 to 6 feet around here Correct There are a lot of people in this building who have figured out a way to get here and hopefully able to get home safely afterwards Yeah I I was staying about uh 20 minutes away and I was in a Ford F150 and I was going about 35 miles Ive forgotten how to drive in the snow from my my days in Chicago So kudos to all the folks that uh came out for this action today Carter Welling able to carve out space inside Hes every bit of 610 240 and really athletic Scott Yeah Carter Well hes got both of the field goals tonight doesnt he Carter Welling getting it done here Trying to get his team off of this launch pad here We played five minutes Neither neither team can get going Its been two and a half minutes since Pittsburgh got its only bucket Brandon Cummings their leading score has come into the game number three in blue And so hes instant offense How about that for a stroke Demarco Miner at 37 on the year He has had a couple of stops previously and I can tell you Jeff Cable and his crew are happy to have him in the pit uniform this season Yeah D Meyer is fantastic He didnt shoot the ball very good Just one of six from the outside but he found the range on that one Theres a bucket inside So after not being able to score we get backto back buckets by both squads Well the pass fake by Justin Porter made the student section behind us go oo 76 Tigers back in front Noitis number 25 for Pittsburgh into the game as well He can shoot it averaging over eight points per game Dunning is fouled That personal is going to go against Wellen Well go back to this one here by Pittsburgh Just a little push inside little Vstep to the outside clear some space from the defender knock down the the jump shot And then I love this one right there Splitting the defense Always like those little guys that can go in amongst the trees and attack the rack Well Miner had a huge three to beat Ohio State earlier this season was back in late November in whats probably Pittsburghs biggest win of the season so far Now Carter Welling has two personals Well this is what Big Corin loves to do He likes to use those big wide shoulders in that 240 lb frame and stick them right into the chest of the defender and get those foul calls He gets to the line quite a bit on the season Hes one of about a handful of guys in the ACC averaging 12 points and eight boards This kid gets it done Coming up next well send you to McCamish Pavilion for Caleb Wilson in number 16 North Carolina music squaring off in Atlanta against Georgia Tech Yeah Corin leads this Pittsburgh team with six double doubles on the year and he is third in the ACC averaging over 34 minutes per game And that has had to change throughout the season for Jeff Cable He put together what he thought was going to be a bigger stronger older front line But Papa Amadu Kanti is out for the season Lost in late November to an injury against Ohio State And probably the bigger loss is Deshawn Jackson who because of a heart condition is out for the season Justin Porter buries his second three of the afternoon And so without Deshawn Jackson Cam Corin has had to play far more minutes and far more in the five position as opposed to playing his more natural four Yeah And and he played 40 minutes against Wake Forest the other day and he was only able to get up three field goal attempts That that seems for your best player to only get three shots seems like a something that you wouldnt be spell a recipe for success and you get the victory But hes unselfish But tonight today here hes got to be more selfish Hes got to get himself 10 12 15 field goal attempts Theres K handing it off to Cummings a sophomore from Midland Pennsylvania Grew up a Pit Panthers fan attending the Peterson Event Center going to work out there with his older brother who also played for Pit Somehow able to get the ball to Corin who missed the shot Clemson with it The Tigers have gone to their bench This is Ace Buckner who brought it up Buckners got it back Quarters heated up a bit Hes got five quick points Clemsons made its last three from the floor Godfrey draws the double team Corin knocks it away Three on the shot clock but a Johnson for three Pittsburghs defense excellent on that possession Yeah R RJ Godfrey came over and provided some help against the big fella inside that was having his way and it really just put an end to that pit attack Thats exactly what these Tigers do They play defense by committee They give up nothing easy once the ball gets below the free throw line Under 12 minutes to go first half from the corner No good for Indraitis got a foul down inside Nick Davidson lot bigger than Brandon Cummings who is going to be called for the personal foul as we head to break as a freshman in the ACC Yeah Coach Cable says that times where he has on this team these guy guys that hang their head when they dont do something well But obviously Witherspoon that time showed that he had the moxy to come back and take the big shot in overtime to give his team the victory I love that And Witherspoon was a recruit who Brad Brownell and his staff coveted They offered him as well Second turnover for Clemson But a Johnson called for traveling but Witherspoon was offered by Clemson Virginia Tech Vanderbilt West Virginia Maryland and Butler but it was Pittsburgh where he wanted to be for his fouryear career Well I I I we had a chance to talk to Coach Cable before the game and I I see why he would like to come here I would want to play for Coach Cable He is just a motivating coach that just instills confidence in his players Theyre going to travel right down the lane Kieran Mullen off the bench with two points Pittsburghs first made bucket in over 3 minutes Yeah and they need to get a bump off of that bench So because Clemson certainly is going to get a bump off of theirs Tell you what Nick Davidson has a pretty stroke The numbers are 33 but when hes got his feet set and a little bit of room hes really really good Yeah hes one of these bigs that can stretch the floor So you dont have to play pick and roll with him all the time You can pick and pop him and he can find that range in transition as a trail big as well Terrific ball movement by Pittsburgh Miner off the shot fake able to find Barry Dunning flying in for the follow slam Barry Dunning flashing the hops down there You got to put a body on number 22 Nice highlight Real dunk for Barry Dunny Well the twotime Mr basketball in the state of Alabama Was a bigtime recruit coming out of high school out of Miguel Tulin Catholic in Mobile And he spent his freshman year playing for Eric Muscleman at Arkansas Top 100 recruit He didnt find his way until last season when Dunning went home to South Alabama and played for his hometown team the Jaguars And he has really blossomed over the last two years Yeah look at Coach Cable there Realizes hey Im playing against a tough defensive team Lets not make it easier for them by having sloppy passes and unforced errors Shot clock winding down Clemson still works the ball around but its taken away by DeMarco Miner the rejection at the other end by a sprinting Dylan Hunter What a Johnson went to the other side I think if he goes straight up on the left side hes got an easier lane to the basket Probably accurate but hes trying to get the foul That was his main uh point right there Going from one side of the floor to the other as he get into the body of the defender See this one more time here get that block shot on one end and then Clemsons off of the the other way They they protect their basket Id say as good if not better than any team in the ACC Thats why theyre number two defensively So at the free throw line the former UAB Blazer spent the last three years for Andy Kennedy down in Birmingham Butter Johnson makes the front end Well tonight at 8 Eastern 5 Pacific after our mens basketball quadruple header right here on ACC Network in the ESPN app the Nothing But Net Crew will break down the day in the ACC with highlights and analysis of every mens game and look ahead at the best matchups on the schedule in the coming week What an afternoon of ACC basketball weve got here on the network today The first of four we will send you to Atlanta following us Chance to see the best front court in the ACC Caleb Wilson and Henry Vasar for the Tarheelss are as dynamic aetw punch as anybody in the country The ACC is fantastic this year I mean pretty much top to bottom and its every every squad is loaded Indraitis misses the three The ball pinballs out of bounds and there is question between the officials who was last to touch Yeah its officials Its the players Its all new to me now these guys sticking that one finger in the air and waving it around in a circle Its something that uh we never used to have there but you can see it bounced off of Butter Johnsons right shoulder and out of bounds And some Pittsburgh keep shot clock at 16 Just past the midway point of the first half here at Little John Coliseum with Scott Williams the former Tarheel Im Doug Sherman Mullen had it poked away on his drive to the basket by Porter Clemson comes away with it but then nearly lost it Now Buddy Johnson will dribble into the front court You know Pittsburgh just when they think they got a bucket Clemson stops him at the rim and thats like a fivepoint turnaround as its threepoint shot the other way goes in from the right corner Yeah Dylan Hunter his first three points but he impacts winning as well as anybody for Clemson Had a great conversation with him after practice yesterday Hes got a 31 career assist to turnover ratio Minor no And the man who grabbed the rebound Dylan Hunter said he manipulates the game He has learned in his four years here at Clemson how to handle the game and how with his mind to control what goes on out on the floor on both ends Here he is with it Tries for another three ball This one rattles out Well Pittsburgh right now they theyre searching hard for some offense They dont have corn out there See Aleppas not out there Its got to be Witherspoon and Dunning to be able to provide some some offense here for them Minor drive and dish Dunning No Johnson with another rebound But look how good Clemson is defensively Right We already saw a couple of buckets inside get denied they knock the ball away they get turnovers they challenge the threepoint line There goes Godfrey to the rack Another good look for the Tigers who have made five of their last eight from the floor And Godfrey will be at the line shooting two when we come back a heart and desire to go get that basketball anytime it goes up on that glass Meanwhile RJ Godfrey the senior from Sani Georgia back with Clemson this year after one season down in Athens Georgia He is back home where he wanted to be right along and happy to be closing out what has been a noteworthy career He was a key piece on that elite 18 a couple of years ago Makes the second and the Tigers lead by nine over the Panthers This is my second time getting my eyeballs up and close and personal on Godfrey Jr and I just love the way this guy plays basketball Hes an old school 90s basketball player He plays physical He plays tough Hes kind of like like he and uh Carter Welling are like the steak and lobster It doesnt matter which ones steak which ones lobster but when you got them both its good things takes real real good recipe out there Witherspoon spots up and only hits the glass off to the left Yeah Well in the foul trouble and theyre getting some good minutes from Davidson Not only knocking down shots hes controlling that defensive glass is what Carter Welling generally does Theres an illegal screen along the baseline Confrey doesnt like it but I think the official is correct Well the fouls are piling up Weve got five different players with two personal fouls That was RJ Godfreyys first but uh we havent seen nearly as much of Roman Ceppa as we thought we would coming in because he picked up two early fouls So Caleppa has two Brandon Cummings has two coming off the bench for Pit And then for Clemson Jake Wallen and Carter Welling have two fouls Yeah coach Cable realizes hey I got 11 points here We only got 6 and a half 6 minutes and 45 seconds to play He got Corin and Caleppa back in this basketball game Well they are now one of 12 from beyond the threepoint line And theyre getting farther off the mark as the game goes Yeah it is Its its hard to make outside shots when you havent made any shots And that time theyre going to a foul box it out I think Davidson got the bad end of this one here Hes trying to box out corn whos like wrestling an alligator down there on that block fell He was kind of holding on Officials going to give uh give him the whistle for it First foul on the senior from Mission Vieo California And now the whistle goes the other way as those two bang again This time it goes against Pittsburghs Cameron Corin Yeah I think they got Corin down there He said he likes the right block better Hes down here trying to fight on that that left block and just that little left arm You can put it into the defender but soon as that you know you start getting that space underneath your armpit and that that left arm starts leaving your body frame too much officials going to blow that whistle every time And so Scott Corin joins the growing list of players with two personals And now Davidsons going to pick up a foul for running over applause DeMarco Miner So thats the second foul on Nick Davidson Well these officials like their whistles today Theyre blowing that quite a bit But you can see Davidson with his second quick foul now on one on the defensive end that one on the offensive And when you try to set that that tie screen as a big you have to make sure even if you stop a little short of where youre supposed to be that you get your feet set Anytime the officials see your feet or your shoulders move it into the defender theyre going to blow that whistle Now I would think with all the fouls you are very much right at home Scott Williams I knew you were going to go there I just knew you were going there Douggee ACC leader in personal fouls Yeah Yeah Well hey its something Jordan never did at Carolina So you know I led Carolina in fouls just about every uh one of my four years And as a result you become the alltime ACC fouls leader So I can always hang my hat on that It worked out in a 15year NBA career 545 remaining in the half Terrific defense by the freshman Witherspoon to block that shot Here come the Panthers trying to get themselves back on the board Ill tell you what Karine or Kieran Mullen the 7 foot freshman from British Columbia has given them a nice spark He was the last one I wrote down on my games notes for today And youre right hes given a great bump off of that bench his wheels uh after that rebound was secured to get out in transition and get that bucket before the Tigers could set their defense RJ Godfrey is wobbled in the lane as play continues and now theyre going to stop He must have taken a shot to the head because clearly youd give him a standing eight count music if this was boxing Yeah I dont know if he got it in in the forehead the eyeball or the nose but youre right hes not feeling real good right now Official stop play I thought a player had to leave the court if he stopped to play Theyre going to let him play on Were going to keep an eye on him Im not sure he is 100 yet Get the smell of salt out there Do they use that in basketball anymore I dont Is that just football Back in your day maybe Oh we had everything back in the day Witherspoon off the bounce Again one and done mostly for this Pit Panthers offensive attack shooting only 23 from the floor here in the first half by the Panthers Chase Thompson backing down on Mullen whos going to be called for the foul Lets take a look at what happened to RJ Godfrey Yeah when that shot goes up it generally gets physical You can see a couple of Panthers gliding right into Godfrey It didnt look like he took an elbow so thats a good thing Maybe just a shoulder and uh hell be able to shake that off and continue on Hes tough as nails this kid That foul was on Mari Moore his third as the foul shot is made by Chase Thompson RJ Godfrey comes from a tough athletic family Hes Randall Godfrey Jr His father was an allAmerican linebacker at Georgia where he roommed by the way coincidentally with Dylan Hunters father Bryce and Randall Senior had 11 years in the NFL His son apparently not I mean he looks like he could play tight end or defensive end in the NFL but he doesnt have any want to do that He wants to play professional basketball after his college days are done here at Clemson Witherspoon lost it I am so impressed with the way the Tigers slide their feet the way they hold their ground the way they go at their defensive glass You know you mentioned it no stars on this team right Probably not going to get a first team all ACC performer maybe not a second team maybe not even honorable mention right Brad Brownell told us yesterday that its very real that his team might not have anybody on any of the all ACC teams Hard to believe for somebody whose team is right now just one game back at Duke in second place in the race for the regular season title Yeah second place Theyre 22 in the country Theyre 17 and four and as you mentioned seven1 in the ACC Theres a good defensive stop for Pittsburgh Lets see if they can get that rebound and try to attack before Tigers can set their D Dunning lobs inside a little too tall for Caleppa Panthers cough it up again Clemson on a 122 run over the last six minutes Ace Buckner into the trees and its a blocking foul against Pittsburgh So once again well take a break and have free throws for Clemson on the other side Attack Im too busy distracting you here Excuse me Scott Youre all Im just enjoying your stuff Youre all good my friend I I I I mean listen I I I couldnt score six points in an empty gym So to watch these guys go out here I was a defensive guy you know and I loved your game except for that March day in 87 at the Meadowlands Other than that I was rooting for you Yeah thats where were going to get your Syrac Uh but this this is this is the way um basketball is meant to play You play defense uh and you get out in transition you score uh when youre have an opportunity If not you set it up you move the ball around you take a couple ticks off of the glass off the clock rather and you score You try to score inside But look at the job Even though they gave up an offensive rebound the second shot opportunity again comes from outside the paint Godfrey no but there to clean it up his fellow senior Dylan Hunter Godfrey cant really get going but its the relentless attack of going inside Theyre not shooting a high percentage yet They got a 15point lead They havent scored 30 points yet Were under three minutes to go Well Pittsburgh has more turnovers than made field goals so far today And the cold shooting continues now one of 16 from distance Yeah And if you know coach Capable he knows his squad better than me And obviously hes got some guys in some foul trouble here Doesnt want to get him uh another foul right before the half but you got to get more pick and roll You got to get more punching size You got to get more attack with that ball below the free throw line RJ Godfrey just going to work along that baseline What a spin move That was electric Left the freshman Witherspoon in his dust Godfrey with a reverse Makes it 3013 Two minutes to go in the first half You must have heard me talk bad about how he hadnt done anything in the first half He said Put that in your mouth Williams Witherspoon back outside Miner steps back for the contested three Tell you what Hunter did everything he could to stick with him Thats just a really nice shot by Miner Yeah it it really was Hes had a couple or a couple pit players have had that where theyve kind of attacked into the defense Uh and Clemsons so uh programmed to give ground and not get beat on a drive that theyve Panthers have been able to size up those outside shots Johnson like butter for three Thats great Buddy Johnson is one of these guys that he comes off that pine but hes not a starter but he he has the starters mentality So if hes getting hes got a little uh space on the floor he will fire it up You know Clemson came into the season with 10 players Brad Brownell wanted to play regularly and used line changes like hockey five in five out and he loved the practice setup so that everybody got valuable minutes on the floor But when Zack Foster went down with a season ending torn ACL in his right knee against South Carolina back in mid December Coach Brown Ellis had to adjust things a little bit Still has depth just not as much And they cant play as fast as he wanted to at the start of the year No No he cant play as fast but he doesnt need to right He doesnt need to have a a bunch of guys that can knock a bunch of threes He just has to have Its like a mudslide Its exactly what Pit has had happened to him Its not like a one quick Yeah flash flood Its like a slowm moving mudslide You just keep taking the guys out one at a time taking a play around taking the b ball to the basket getting a guy in foul trouble getting an offensive rebound and um now theyre enjoying a a huge advantage here going into the break Did Dylan Hunter beat the buzzer He did not There was no panic He was still trying to direct traffic but he didnt get RJ Godfrey on the floor where he wanted to and didnt get the shot up in time Well you know listen and and thats not the worst thing though right So you get the shot clock violations 32 seconds to go You got all the momentum of this half You dont want to give uh Pittsburgh a live ball turnover trying to make a a forced pass or try to make something happen uh that gives them an easy opportunity to score where they feel a little bit better about themselves going into the break Right now theyre kind of down in the mouth and they dont have an answer for this Tigers defense Well Clemson on a 133 run over the last nearly 5 minutes The man with the basketball DeMarco Miner the only pit player to score during that time cheering Miner with Hunter trying to stay with him now on the switch Chase Thompson cheering Miner for three Dunning gets it to Cummings Pits leading scoreer Cummings is scoreless as we head to the intermission ball with one another So even if somebody does make a mistake defensively they got somebody right behind them to pick them up Meanwhile Pittsburgh offensively had its lowest scoring half of the year They had scored just 22 a couple of times They go inside for two to Roman Caleppa and he has a chance for three and maybe that is where they can get some offense going Give coach Cable a big bump right there fist bump for going inside to his freshman who was on the struggle bus in that first half and well with the foul trouble They pumped the ball right inside to him and I love the fact that he takes his time Hes patient for a freshman around that basket He plays with power concentration after the contact and he finishes off the threepoint play And look at now Pittsburgh getting up and put a little more pressure on the ball defensively in the back court Yeah foul trouble is going to be a thing here in the second half Caleppa and Mullen have three apiece for Pittsburgh That was the second on RJ Godfrey and he and three of his teammates all with two fouls here early in the second half Nick Davidson Jake Wallen and Carter Welling Heres Cam Corin and Pittsburgh on it Second possession gets right to the rim Corin with a big screen that take the ball hard to the baseline You take two defenders with you and Corin with the good hands in traffic able to finish Like I said he can finish right He can finish length Thats the core we were hoping to see in the first half Well in that first half he played only nine minutes was 0 for three from the floor So you think about their two physical guys inside CP and Corin had to combine two points in the first half Theyve already scored five together here in the second Thats the third foul on Cam Corin A huge problem for Pit I was hoping that wasnt on Corin We want to see a good basketball game today We cant have all these guys in foul trouble sitting on the bench Justin Porter inbounds for Clemson RJ Godfrey out there along with Jake Quin Heres their point guard Dylan Hutter who comes and takes the basketball Picked up on the switch by Caleppa Porter attacks from the left side It was blocked I believe that might have been Dunning who got a piece And now the foul against Indrusitis More free throws coming for Clemson I think it was Carter Welling that got a right hand on that ball to keep it uh alive And Wallen I tell you this this kid dont sleep on him He didnt have a big first half but uh he can get hot real quick from the outside stroking triples Hes got live legs too He can get to the basket in transition as well So you see the size of Wallen Welling and RJ Godfrey Thats tough for any team in the ACC and especially this undersized Pitts squad Yeah And Wallen is a Utah transfer from a football family and you can see it Hes 610 210 His dad Rick played football in the late 80s at BYU and his grandfather Marvin Wallen played fullback at Arizona State and was a Chicago Bears draft pick Good stock here for Clemson A lot of size as you say Scott from top to bottom Yeah and we didnt really see even see the a healthy dose of Ace Buckner Now theyre getting his his dad Greg Buckner played in the NBA when I was in the league and they get another stop down here So the Tigers got back to doing what they did in that first half creating those turnovers Yeah theres Ace Buckner had just one made free throw the red shirt freshman from Dallas who coach Brownell says is his most competitive player on the team A hard worker and as you mentioned his dad Greg played here in the mid to late 90s and was so good Welling tried to go to the left hand couldnt and the foul with DeMarco Miner grabbing the rebound and if its on Wallen that is his third personal Well he had such a good game last Saturday at Georgia Tech Wallen with 13 points his second best outing of the year First time in double figures since early December but hes not been able to get it going thanks in large part to foul issues today Just a couple of points both from the free throw line Yeah but then they can come back with Nick Davidson too if they want to here in a little bit and give him some run Hes got some size and he had a nice little first half as well Miner gives it back to Caleppa Got it Well we talked about Caleppa not having that great outside stroke but hes certainly capable And when you let him get right in front of that basket sometimes those threepoint shots if you get your feet set just become long free throws as little miscommunication that Godfrey throws it out of bounds Well Caleppa has three consecutive double doubles And current Washington wizard Justin Champeni the last pit player with four in a row back in 2021 Weve talked about the rebounding prowess of Caleppa and in talking with Jeff Cable before the ball game he does think his upside if he continues to progress down the road could be in the NBA Pit perfect three for three from the floor to start this second half while Clemson still looking for its first made bucket Down under five seconds Tough shot Did it catch iron Apparently not Its a shot clock violation but the Panthers do believe it did catch the side of the rim So theyre going to take another look I believe Yeah I I think the officials uh were in agreement that that ball hit backboard and then kind of the low side of that uh right left side of the rim So theyre going to take a quick look at this one I I am sure theyre going to put some more time back on that shot clock Yeah And actually Ron Groover has already signaled to us that theyre going to reset the shot clock because the officials review for a potential shot clock violation Well the officials seem to be in agreement but they are going to take a look just to make sure Our officials Jeff Pond Jerry Heer and Ron Groover take another look Did it catch the left side of the rim Yeah Andrew Sidus know he was up against that shot clock And Ill tell you what Im not sure You think it did I think it I think it hit Net I couldnt see if it actually hit rim So well well probably slow it down and get another quick look at it But he was trying to do the right thing and get it up on that rim But again look at that Clemson defense Like youre making your final attack with under two seconds to go in and the shot clock You cant consistently do that with success Noitis the sophomore from Lamont Illinois After review the ball hit the rim Pittsburgh balls side outbounds Teach me how to Douggeie You are always on top of these Im hardly about 50 Youre probably closer to 95 Thats not true at all That youre telling stories right there Mr Williams Well either way it looks like Pits going to have an opportunity to take this thing out on the side with 19 seconds to operate Now they had a chance to rally with Coach Cable Good well coached teams Their baseline out of bounds and the sideline out of bounds plays Um you got to be successful if you want to be a good team especially in the ACC Here a little high pick and roll Omari Witherspoon into the lane Tough shot Got the whistle and he will shoot too Well Clemson makes it work for everything And it looked like Witherspoon initially had the advantage but boy do these Tigers clamp down defensively in that paint Look at that Four Tigers around that basketball And then Witherspoon has to make a a great move with some footwork turning away from that defense and got just enough body contact that he got that trip to the line But when you got to go against that type of defense consistently it makes it real tough But listen they have cut into that 15 point or 17 point halftime deficit Now we got ourselves a single um uh digit deficit Now 3526 Amari Witherspoon has made two foul shots today Thats the sum total of his offense so far Tigers first three and a half minutes of the second half have struggled against this Pittsburgh defense to get it going They picked it up right Like it just it seemed like there was a better body language out of the Panthers here after they had some chance to to go to the break and and look at some film in the locker room Well Nick Davidson that time got great position and able to lay it over the rim Yeah Was that Davidson or Welling Those guys they look a lot like that I think that was might have been Carter Welling down there using that spin move along the uh basket No it was Davidson It was Davidson Youre right Okay Witherspoon straight line drive and his first made bucket makes it 3728 Well a rare opportunity after a made bucket for Pit to score inside and they capitalize So now after a slow first half it seems like both teams here starting to pick it up for those last 60 seconds Timeout here inside Little John as Pittsburghs trying to make a ball game of it Yeah nice little spin move down there by the California kid using that uh right hand hook and then another good move with the footwork taking a hard to the rack Going to say I dont think I had much success in this building and uh except for the one year we went 140 in the ACC Those Tigers are tough here in Little John Thats back when the court went the opposite direction right It was 90° different before the renovation So you ran what would be the wrong way the way Little John is here now Foul against DeMarco Miner and those are the good old days of the ACC when you went to every building every year and uh so the Tarheelss when you lost on the occasion you lost you expected a court storm Yeah And then and and Elden Campbell and Dale Davis the two Tigers main attack there They were fantastic All right Well let me tell you You had seven points 11 rebounds but the best news was only four fouls You didnt foul out Listen I had just because I was the alltime ACC fouls leader I didnt always foul out of basketball games They gave me five and like I think I averaged about four and a half laughter over the course of my career Well as we showed in that highlight the great Alden Campbell was seven to 15 in that game 17 points in his 31 minutes And uh we again keep him in mind You faced him in the NBA finals in 91 as well as he played for the Lakers and you played for the Chicago Bulls Nick Davidson with the dunk as Clemson once again makes it a double figure lead and and the folks here in Clemson South Carolina were so shocked late last year when Elden died suddenly and his name still hangs here in the Raptors and hes still after all these years the alltime leading scoreer in the history of this program Yeah a great Tiger and a sad loss for not only Tiger Nation but also the fans of the NBA Our NBA family were just shocked to get that news See Aleppa with the finish I I could do nothing with him He had calves that were like they looked like they someone stuck bowling balls in the back of both of his leg for a big tall guy He could jump out of the gym Carter Welling misses and the rebound grabbed by Miner And as we were looking at things today about Elden Campbell one statistic from his NBA days blew me away Indraitis off the window No Elden Campbell is the third alltime career block shot leader in the history of the LA Lakers behind of course Kareem and Shaq Kareem and Sha Wow Elden Campbell is number three on that incredible list Yeah And Campbell like I said his athleticism his ability to block and alter shots He was just a tremendous player Years later we would face off uh in the NBA playoffs when he was playing for the Charlotte Hornets and I still have bruises from that series from 2001 Well you saw the banners flanking him What a golden era with Coach Ellis they had here at Clemson with all those big guys that you had to deal with That was a lot of size and strength in those days for Clemson A lot like this group here one of the biggest and strongest if not the biggest and strongest in the ACC in 2026 Heres a big part of it Davidson who transferred in had a lot of suitors last spring and he chose to come across the country and become a Clemson Tiger along with his younger brother Blake Davidson who is red shirting this year But you know Nick and Blake committed the day before their father passed away And so the coaching staff Brad Brownell Billy Donlin the rest of them have really played a key role in both brothers acclamation Heres a wedgie by Nick He doesnt like that their acclamation here to the east And uh you know he is a Southern California Nick Davidson like you 610 from Southern California Hes a surfer Do you surf Have you ever surfed Ive never been on skis Ive never been on a surf board I We used to do the old body boards like the Mo boogie body board lay down and catch the waves We would ditch school after lunch and right down Beach Boulevard 35 minutes and go get in the ocean and and do body boarding and body surfing but I never had a surfboard RJ Godfrey great position on Corin Goes over that right shoulder for two Hes my favorite player on this Clemson squad I know were announcers Were not supposed to have favorites but Im going to say it right now I got a chance to talk to this kid briefly before and he said Im powered by my faith Scott Thats what I want you to let people know And you can see right there this kid hes a big strong man He He is going to attack inside any chance he gets And theres another one of those Clemson turnovers Uh kind of an unforced error but look at the position Hes got the ball Hes done his work so early Hes gotten the ball down at right on that restricted line You know thats a right shoulder turn lefthanded jump hook that hes shot thousands of times You can make him that shot hes going to make it 75 80 of the time Now we talked about the older generation of Godfries in their physicality RJs best friends with his younger brother Grant who was a fourstar linebacker recruit out of Georgia who is now a red shirt sophomore at Kentucky RJs kid brother 63 234 So you know they have beat the heck out of each other a time or two Kid brother got to be pretty pretty tough to play with RJ Godfrey Ill tell you what hes got the size to do it Look at Godfrey going to work again Flashing the footwork down on the block will not be stopped RJ Godfrey uh when you get him that ball kind of anywhere below that free throw line he knows thats his time to shine and he knows his team needs him to operate with efficiency down there in the paint How many points he got now Hes up to nine Hes closing in on double figures Dunning No See Aleppa always going after the offensive glass Hes fouled by Godfrey That is the third on RJ You know Brad Brownell told me yesterday the most pleasing thing to him this year with so many new faces is that all the personalities have meshed out of the transfer portal from the freshman and that the uh players who played bigger roles in other places some in the mid major level have fully accepted and embraced their current role here at Clemson You can see it Its on full display here in this basketball game today These guys have a joy I said it the first half Ill say it again cuz its so fun to watch Some of the best teams to be a part of as a player and even my short period of time in coaching is when guys like playing for one another Ive been on some teams where that hasnt been the case Allan Iverson Philadelphia 76 uh where it is just miserable to show up every day and you got guys that love playing for each other and have a joy for the game and dont care who gets the credit as long as a team gets a victory Thats the best place to be And theres a hard fought bucket inside Is that Dunny No that was Brandon Cummings A wild shot His first points of the day the leading scoreer on the season for Pit Well RJ Godfrey is one of the real tone setters coming back to Clemson this year I love the way this kid operates Hes going against a 610 240 pounder and he technically took the coaching and so we are expecting something big from her thanks to the coaching advice shes gotten from the mens associate Billy Donlin And uh I just think thats so neat that why not utilize those resources You share the same facility You know each other And why not if the mens coach sees something that he can help on the womens side and vice versa you should do it Heck yeah I love that And I love a coach being a coach Doesnt matter if youre one of my play see a way to tweak a a player shot you go help out Brandon Cummings sophomore from Midland PA Lot of time left in this game You know Clemson has not put Pit away yet They Theyre still right there A bucket here goes a long way to cut to that large deficit Davidson got tangled up with Dunning And that goes against Nick Davidson Just the energy now thats his third personal foul but the energy for the Panthers is better here in the second half You got CPA crashing the offensive glass Hes in double figures now and scoring with 10 and five Two O boards Theres an an opportunity for an O board by Dunning And now its a chance for some second chance points See Aleppa has been much more active in the second half The foul trouble of the first half kept kept him in check but he now leads the Panthers in the scoring column with a dozen And tell you that thats a rugby player going full speed in a spin move Oh no he just got his fourth down there reaching But its hard its hard to teach that Im sure coach Cable loves this raw talent that this kid has and hes just going to get better as every game that he has opportunity to be on the football Look at that devastating spin move snorts right there Right into your living room there and finishing with the off hand That is tremendous by this young freshman Yeah 10 of his 12 points coming in the second half in these first nine minutes But back to the bench for coach Cable with those four fouls And so with that Carter Welling at the line How good are the freshman this year in the ACC You know hardly anybody even talks about C Apa with all the other good freshman but I I was looking at some of the numbers in the freshman 6673 points Thats the most points in 15 years uh in division one basketball by uh freshman in the country So I think the ACC is in pretty good shape if they can keep some of this young talent hanging around Thats the key Can you keep them and keep adding to it Carter Welling makes pair free throws Hes one of nine Tigers to score here this afternoon Now Witherspoon is not a natural one but with the makeup of this roster for Pittsburgh Hes got more time as a freshman than they probably would like but that sort of experience I would think Scotts going to help him down the road Its going to help him Obviously its its helping see Aleppa each week each month that goes by his development And I know coach Cable is right now you know tied T14 here in the ACC but his players play hard Even though they make mistakes they continue to play hard for coach 11th Pittsburgh turnover today Clemson with it Wallen inside Welling to the left hand again Great position You got to get your work done defensively before the ball gets in there And it was too late once the ball was in the post Right The offense uh players and we saw it once before with RJ Godfrey This time the big Welling 611 Look at that interior pass Thats a foot outside the restricted area Those are moves that these guys shoot in practice time and time again Im talking hundreds if not thousands of times they work on that right shoulder turn to their left hand jump hook with the coach banging on them with the pad So it becomes routine that now its just muscle memory at that point and youre going to shoot it You know like I say 75 80 of those And during one of those drills yesterday at practice Carter Welling was having a little fun He was showing his personality while getting pounded on and still going up and throwing down dunk after dunk and giving out a big yell There he is getting the rebound He has been a big addition for Clemson this season I I just like this kid right Just barely creeps in double figure scoring Now hes going to step outside try his range from three Dont know if coach Bernell really wanted one at that point in time as he slumps his shoulders on the bench cuz youre pounding him inside Like why not just keep the success that youre having going to the basket Corin puts his shoulder into the midsection of Carter Welling and lays it in Thats the second time weve seen big number two just pound guys inside with that right shoulder using a little off hand Heres Welling He is fouled You know his defense is what really stuck out last year at Utah Valley He was the defensive player of the year in the WAC Second team all conference Spent his first three years at UC Irvine And so Welling closing out his college career presumably here Hes got one more year of eligibility I think Although I only say those things well with not a lot of confidence The way uh things change they they move the goal post and the finish line all the time But I think Carter Welling has another year available to him after this one Yeah And look why wouldnt he want to come back right He came from Utah Valley Got a chance to see some of his action when I was with Grand Canyon uh when they were out there in that Western Athletic Conference Know this kids ability to see the WAC player of the year in 2425 you know this season yeah his numbers are down a little bit but he enjoys the winning here on a a larger stage and coach Bernell give him a big slap on the backside Appreciate his efforts this afternoon and hes one of the guys coach Brownell was talking about yesterday who has willingly moving up to a power conference program accepted a lesser role That foul on Cameron Corin his fourth big number two with the basketball stays on for Pit with over nine minutes remaining in regulation Yeah but coach Cable doesnt really have a choice right Like youre down by 15 points here You got to get some offense and hes the one guy that can provide it consistently And at this point Pit has three players with four fouls Mullen Caleppa and Corin So where do you go Keeps laying until you cant You stay with him right Like and and youre hoping he can stay out of foul trouble uh and youre hoping you can cut into that uh large deficit and then maybe you can start well okay maybe well get him out of here if we can cut into that deficit the next three four minutes and then they have him have him fresh for the last three or four minutes Witherspoon uses the screen by Corin finds a gap and puts it in Very nicely done for the freshman out of St Johns College High School in Washington DC But thats what you got to have right You got to have these guys help one another Score a little pick Get the defender on your backside Now you get yourself back on balance And that little midrange jump shot is going to be true Heres a turnover Quick hands by Mari Moore Corin able to pay it off at the other end How about this Just when they are just about ready to throw some dirt on top of the Panthers theyve come to life with backto back field goals Its an 11point game Hunter and Buckner in the back court along with Porter Hunter filling in the gap behind him Jake Wallen beautifully found by the point guard and a terrific stroke by the big man They cut him off inside but we mentioned the first half Wall could step behind the ark and knock in the triple Excellent offensive display music there by the Tigers And for this Pit Panthers basketball team for the last eight years its been all about family Jeff Cable also has on staff his younger brother Jason Cable who like yourself Scott Williams a former Tarheel They are of course from a coaching family They lost their dad to ALS a number of years ago and he was a marvelous coach as well And you get that sense when you are around this tit program A lot of people say it for them it truly is a family Yeah it is a family We got a chance to talk to him He said he used to watch me play when I was at Carolina His dad would take him to a lot of games How the heck did he end up at two Thats what I want to know Moore tried to beat the shot clock and missed the iron And so its a shot clock violation And that takes us to our under eight media timeout Well step away and be back to Little John in a moment hard for team to run their offense Pick Davidson with the basketball out there with Carter Welling the size along with Jake Wallen And then the two perimeter players Justin Porter and Ace Buckner whos got the basketball now Just over seven minutes to go here at Little John Coliseum Clemson looking to improve to 184 81 in conference play Ace Buckners first bucket is from downtown Yeah he said hed been quiet in that first half and uh hes a hardworking kid son of an NBA basketball player and his dad will be real proud right there A little step back Was that a triple for Ace stepping out there on the perimeter knocking down the long ball Indeed it was Wheres number 21 Just like his daddy used to do here at Clemson Miner off the side iron Witherspoon tracks it down Corin into a double team See Aleppa takes an extra step Thats a traveling violation Ace Buckner all 63 180 of them He is a confident baller here for the Tigers Yeah I love this right here Right Thats just that little inside out move You step back there You get the defender uh just backpedaling enough that he loses his balance and it gives you the extra tick Get back on balance yourself and then you get a clean look at the outside shot Four points four assists for Ace whose uncle Andre Buckner played on Dukes 2001 National Championship team And Ace cant wait to get his first opportunity to actually play at Cameron Hes looking forward to the game uh February 14th which could be for first place in the ACC Its a game thatll be on ESPN Thatll be a fun little family rivalry right there right His dad and then Ace and then his uncle Thatll be fun And oh by the way Duke is being pushed in Blackburg Virginia this afternoon Thats on ESPN The Blue Devils under four minutes to go lead by six over the Hokes Oh they had a comfortable lead earlier in that game Dont sleep on the Hokes I We were just up there last week They have a good sw a solid basketball squad and they uh like this Tigers team They can ratchet up on the defensive end as well cheering Look at that bucket along the baseline by Davidson This kid is having himself one heck of a basketball game Hes knocked down the outside shot Hes played big around the basket And look at him out there directing the defense Uh being vocal Well Davidsons out of modern day high school Same Santa Ana hoops power as Miles Simon LeBron Ellis Mike Hopkins Bold Bowl Hes a good one Yeah Gets away with a little chicken wing right there to wrap that around Corin does see Aleppa does a nice job working the freshman along that baseline and the guys that could always get from one side of the basket to the other Uh the ones that always impress me because I could never do it I laughter I was strictly set to one side locked in there No spin move That was the third foul on Carter Welling Corin missed the front end and so no bonus now Five minutes to go in regulation The Tigers in control as they have been all game Pit led briefly early by a point but its been all Nick Davidson and the Clemson Tigers this afternoon Yeah it put them up to the largest lead of the game now Up by 20 obviously with under five to play This one is well in hand I I just want to see these final five minutes for the Panthers And theyre not going to get this victory but whos going to keep playing hard for the guys in the blue Omari Witherspoon cant get the roll He gets his own miss Had it poked away by Buckner The ball comes to pit and Miner looking to feed Corin and Davidson picks up another foul He got tangled up on the block with Cam Corin Tangled ups a nice way to put it Big Corin putting those big arms on him He was locked up down along that baseline But this is what the young man can do on the offensive end Hes got the ability to stretch that defense Well Nick picks up his fourth personal foul He plans to attend law school after his basketball playing days are done Corin gets the first Hell get a second tonight 8 Eastern 5 Pacific after our mens basketball quadruple header right here on ACC Network in the ESPN app Its the Nothing But Net Crew breaking down the day in the ACC with highlights and analysis of every single mens game here on ACC Network Corin gets a pair Hes got nine points along with three rebounds It hasnt been a a typical corn game right Like hes facing a big front line but you can see the kids got skills right You you seen him down there on that block now Use his size real well use his footwork real well and uh you say hes got that size of that frame and that want to you might see him playing at the next level Good hustle by Barry Dunning to take that pass from Calempa Its been a quiet game for the senior from Mobile Just five points Its a 16point game Yeah See Pitch just didnt have enough of that They didnt have enough opportunities whether you got live ball turnovers or stops and then had a chance to do runouts And when you got to play against this Tiger set defense youre in trouble If you can get them in transition you have much better success Yeah The Tigers are not likely to beat themselves right Scott No not not at all Theyre well coached bunch obviously Uh Coach Bernell we talked about it with this win 200 wins here at Clemson at home for coach Bernell with this win 57yearold native of Evansville Indiana former division 3 point guard at Depal University Brad Brownells team and his program cooking these days up 16 over Pittsburgh last night Theyve got a womens game tomorrow When are you going to get home and shovel music the driveway I dont know But we appreciate it I I Im Im stuck here My flight was just cancelled I got to get a good uh restaurant recommendation Ill be spending another night here down in the in the South Maybe a night or two I dont know how they clear the runways Dont tell me that Is they put me on a They rebooked me on an 800 flight You saying thats not going to happen Uh my guess would be no Oh you mean 8 am tomorrow 8 am tomorrow Yeah maybe Look at that by minor Now hes got a couple outside triples here in this game And this is what I wanted to see right Like guys that dont scoreboard watch here at the end of the game Guys that going to keep competing those are the guys that capable are going to want to have on his squad the rest of the year Some guys that going to stay in that foxhole and fight for 40 minutes Well Clemson is well on its way to beating Pittsburgh for the 15th straight time RJ Godfreys been a big part of the last several or many of the last several Got to remember he went to Georgia last year Minor good So you know what All 12 of his points have come on threepoint shots Yeah those four four triples now He had a couple in the first half and then backto back threes right there And hey its still it is a 10point game Maybe Im the one throwing dirt on the Panthers uh too soon 10 points with two minutes Thats not not unheard of Can the Panthers get stops And could they possibly score 10 points on their own in the last 150 whistle and a foul off the ball Yeah thats going to be two shots now Thats the double bonus for the Tigers And so Godfrey at the line as we take a look at the standings coming into the day Lots of action Most everybody on the schedule today Duke is about 20 seconds away from beating Virginia Tech leading 7158 So those two scores will keep the top of the standings 12 Duke and Clemson Elsewhere North Carolina State is just about to beat Wake Forest in Winston Salem And then were going to be followed by what should be a good ball game between North Carolina and Georgia Tech down in Atlanta just as soon as we are done here on the ACC Network We will send it down the road to West Johnson and 3D who will have the call Yeah Im looking forward to that one there for sure that uh Wacy Reeds is going to have a big game against North Carolina This kid Caleb Wilson have you seen him Douggee He is fantastic The young freshman is uh electric way he plays above the rims I got to excuse myself West Durham Im thinking Wes Johnson the former Illinois and Syracuse basketball player West Durham Hes an institution in the city of Atlanta And Dennis Scott have a home game today coming up at 200 Yeah I think everybody knew exactly who you were talking about The legend West Durham for sure He was around Carolina basketball when I was in school 40 years He was his daddy The longtime voice of the Tar Hills Woody Durham an institution And the apple hasnt fallen far from the tree West is himself an institution around the Atlantic Coast Conference and has been for many many years Well they got tangled up as they uh stopped now to clean up the perspiration off the hardwood See Aleppa was the first on the floor Nick Davidson as well there Ace Buckner saying Give me that D thats what I love about college basketball These kids will dive on the floor for that that loose ball in the NBA They just want to reach for it right They dont want to go down there and and bang a knee or an elbow But in college these kids are diving on the floor wrestling for that basketball And again theres the Clemson defense Thats exactly what weve had for 40 minutes right Anytime the Pittsburgh Panthers they get it inside they just swarm to the ball and they punch it away And that allows for you to withstand like right now theyve gone three and a half minutes without a field goal But if your defense is consistent you can weather some of those droughts Yeah I mean they they only give up 65 points a game Theyre going to be well below that number today uh right now as Pit stuck on 52 Witherspoon steps into a three and misses badly Weve seen a number of those from Pittsburgh this afternoon The Roman Caleppa working hard on the offensive glass He got himself going for a little bit Then he picked up that fourth foul and had to go back to the to the bench And thats about all she wrote Theres only a couple differential between the shot clock and the game clock But people that are here that brave the cold weather uh and the snow saw the Tigers come out and play a great game defensively and they play as a team and its fun to watch sit here courtside and be able to call the action with you here today Doug No doubt The defense of Clemson holding Pittsburgh to 20 from threepoint land Five for 25 And they got enough offense as they normally do from enough different players Nick Davidson Carter welling into double figures Little bit from a lot of guys And Brad Brownells team on the verge of winning its 18th game in a row and improving to eight and one in conference play They defend right to the final whistle Ace Buckner poked it away Pit has two seconds They wont take a shot And that will do it 6352 Brad Brownells Clemson Tigers with a victory His 200th as the head coach when they have played here at Little John Coliseum Yeah wonderful team to watch Just a joy Coach Cable is going to have to get in that lab They got to go
