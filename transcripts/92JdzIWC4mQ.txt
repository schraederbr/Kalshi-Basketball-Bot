theyre coming off a break NC state has not played since December 23rd keevi gets us started here with Dennis Parker Jr The Wolf Pack in red and here is a look at the aforementioned DJ horn hell start the possession in the ball game here for us and we got a clock issue right off the Jump well neither clock started not the game clock not the shot clock and Micah Shrewsberry and DJ horn had a laugh about it and so Bill Covington Jr who works with Tony Henderson and Lamar Simpson tonight well go to the so tables to get this sorted out here from a game management perspective weve taken two seconds off the game clock so now we got to get the shot clock under control that be it NC State by the way they only played once a year ago NC State won 8582 in righ so now its four 6 seconds yep okay and I think theyre going to take 6 seconds off the shot clock that leads n stay with 24 its going to be an NBA possession this first one you feel good about it absolutely okay were going to play on here Irish and manto man this matchup between Burton and Horn is an interesting one to watch early how about ji and burns theres DJ already starting the back down here comes the double team from carry Booth wol pack mve it around with t to shoot horn trying to get inside against Tay Davis here Baseline jumper bounds away and a rebound pulled down by the aforementioned Kev ja heres the lineup for noted a third straight game you get both keba ji and Carrie booth on the floor for Coach Shrewsberry kesn has gotten off to a terrific start but the star for the Irish has been the Freshman number three Marcus Burton Jai gets it to him on the cut hell skip for kesn five to shoot boot they whip it around to the left corner corner here is Burton squeezing Baseline feeds inside and the layup is good for Tay Davis boy that was a really impressive offensive possession great ball movement no Panic against pretty tough defense Casey Morel he headlines the NC State lineup with Burns Parker keep an eye on Jaden Taylor theres a skip pass by Burns and its thrown away tried to air mail one to Taylor Wes its interesting the first two possessions Notre Dame isnt double teaming DJ Burns right away they wait until he starts moving toward the basket and when he starts toward the basket they double team and he just threw that one A Little Too Tall hes a much better passer than that yep Burns comes into the ball game averaging almost three assist a game and he likes to pass hes looking for the opportunity to pass Burton at the foul line left it on the rim and the run through rebound for Dennis Parker Jr The Freshman from Richmond Virginia averaging about seven points and four and a half rebounds a game for Kevin Keats and stepping out of bounds is Jaden Taylor the butler transfer in his first year in RW weson thats what Im talking about with DJ Burns he had a wide open shot from just inside the free throw line and he elected to pitch it out to Taylor for a much harder shot in fact an impossible shot since you cant shoot it when youre standing out of bounds DJ horn picking up Burton at the timeline heres kesn skipping it across Burton tees one up and scores and thats another good sign for Notre Dame because Burton with all the things he does really well he does not shoot the three well only 25 coming in yep that is Marcus Burtons 14th three of the year in 53 tries but here hes had six straight double figure games and hes the accs Rookie of the week and theres a rattle in two for DJ horn first points for the Wolfpack and backourt pressure applied here by NC State M horn is a scorer and he can score from any place on the court hes very good in the midrange and that got poked away from behind by DJ horn into the Wolfpack bench and the Wolfpack obviously when they score theyre going to come after you with that fullcourt pressure and they want to keep that pressure on they dont back off when they get into the half court NC State is top 10 in the country in turnover margin they force a bunch of them here is Burton on the drive he got all the way to the rim and scores five for Marcus Burton of noted AES first seven in the games first three minutes obviously hes got some speed but hes also got some strength too because he went through some contact to get to the rim young freshman from mishak Indiana 12th in the ACC in scoring heres morcel Fall Away nicely done k Casey morels first basket and Dan Casey morels been struggling scoring wise here in the last four games well he has and hes hes turned himself into a really good offensive player and even good offensive players struggle from time to time look at Burton Racing now heres Carrie Boos first shot in the lane and it rattles in dropped in off the back of the back of the rim off that flange for Carrie Booth he is coming to the lineup his third straight start tonight he has doubled his scoring and practic doubled his rebounding in those last two starts well hes long hes athletic he can shoot the three heres horn spotting up another two boo the rebound for the Irish now North Carolina state theyre sort of settl and their Balls not moving the players arent moving theres Burton working on Taylor on the drive this is Davis heres kzne tried to fight through back for Davis thats an open three from the right its good for Tay Davis and theres going to be a foul and the three off the ball Davis has got five the foul is on NC State well Dan Notre As got a Vibe a little bit like Saturday against Virginia seeing shots go in from distance well you know they shot the ball very well in that game against Tay Davis coming in after this shot after he made this shot hes now three for 20 on the year shooting threes so Burton a 25 threepoint Shooters knocked one down and Davis knocks one down as well Irish will keep possession because the foul underneath the basket was on DJ burns his first its the first on the wolf pack so Ben Middlebrooks an early insertion into the lineup for Kevin Keats along with mohamd diara the Missouri transfer has checked in as well so Burns gets a seat on the bench and the jumper no good diara scrambling inside has the rebound I think Kevin Keats is trying to match up sizewise against Notre Dame Kei and booth in the game theyre pretty theyre both about 610 yeah heres morcel for Middlebrooks the Clemson transfer now to Taylor Jaden Taylor trying to find an alley picks up on the dribble Taylors another guy who has struggled recently Morel had a three rattle out and the rebound for Kev Notre Dame is not going to be in any hurry here they want a half court game theyll take opportunity when it appears but theyre not going to rush it down the court look at Davis now starting to feel it in traffic forced it up got block diara recovered to Burton Booth a launch back rim missed Taylor the rebound heres the wolf pack trailing eight early and they want to push it sure do Taylor trying to find a seam heres diara doesnt score very much Taylor rubs off that at Middlebrooks screen on the drive in traffic tried de feed middle Brooks and last Touch by Notre Dame Lamar Simpson on the whistle helping out Bill cumington Jr and Tony Henderson anise Debbie thanks very much we welcome you to South B Indiana with Dan boner West Durham and Notre Dame like Saturday against Virginia feeling pretty good early Irish have knocked down some jump shots theyve got an early eightpoint lead here on NC State theyve made some jump shots but they have heavily contested the North Carolina State shots and Middlebrooks hes got to fire that one up there and midle Brooks just one of 10 now from three on this young season you see the start tonight by Notre a couple of Threes they hit 70 from the floor in the first half against Virginia on Saturday on the way to a 7654 win in here tonight another good feel for Micah Shrewsberry Irish out of the gate 6 minutes in theyve got an eightpoint lead theyre making shots and theyre not turn turning it over Jr kesn with 12 to shoot out on the perimeter against DJ horn step back kesn left it short long rebound scooped up Music diara heres horn for morcel front rim Miss of the three booth and Notre Dame doing a really good job on the glass Dan they really are North Carolina but if you dont pass the ball its hard to get guys in position for offensive rebounds and the ball simply hi move them and Marcus Burton The Talented freshman from Muke Indiana turns it over on the dribble and there is 47yearold Indianapolis native Micah shuber now in his first year at South Ben graduate of Hanover College who put together a 3731 Mark in two years at Penn State got the NY lines into the postseason a year ago and a terrific hour by Jack swri and the folks here to replace Mike Bray interesting lineup in the game now for Notre Dame rer is going to have to match up against the r hes got a tremendous size Advantage does Dr heres Taylor whos been quiet jumper rattles away middle Brooks The Second Chance back up strong missed the layup substitutions now for Notre Dame Julian roer the second has come in hes a transfer from Northwestern hes on the floor we also get our first look at Logan Imes freshman from zionville Indiana and Braden Shrewsberry the coachs son is checked on for the first time heres a rightand turn by ji and a foul on Middlebrooks will be his first its the second on the wolf pack Kevin Keat is in season seven in Raleigh wol packs off to a 9 and3 start of course went to the tournament last year in his sixth campaign NC State 9 and3 they beat Boston College in an over overtime game and their only other ACC contest of the season free throw by Jai is good first attempts at the line tonight for the Irish the three teams to whom they lost Wes have a collective record of 33 and four so they havent lost any of those gimme games second free by ji and the Irish with an early 10point lead and here comes Matt Sona onto the floor now for Notre Dame theres a look at Sona senior from state of New York who averaging about 12 minutes a ball game played Just 6 minutes in the victory against Virginia here on Saturday so the only starter left for the Irish in the game is Burton and he leads him in minutes played so thats not a big surprise and theres Michael oconnell the grad transfer from Stanford feeding Middlebrooks inside against Zona off the window and in for Ben Middlebrooks well that is a great pass by oconnell and he comes in the game the ball really starts to move and middle Brooks did a nice job getting position inside eightpoint lead for The Irish Front Court comes Burt well hes got to work really hard just to get the ball up the court and Taylor almost knocked it here to us well connells got his eyes up doesnt he Dan oh Connell hes hes not a great shooter but he can really pass the ball and he just spots Middlebrooks inside Sona lost him in there I think Zona was surprised that oconnell could actually make that pass DJ horn going to get a break cam Woods besser Alabama Jr whos playing tonight for the fourth time guy who got wrapped up in that twotime transfer deal that seemed to hobble most of major college athletics here for about the last three weeks and stepping out of bounds his eyes and the turnover will send it to NC State we get a breaking the action at South B underway with 8 minutes gone eightpoint lead for Notre Dame when youre great its candid conversation Dan and its brutally honest about his basketball team after the game you and I did and look they two and0 since the light has come on in some respect but winning in the ball going in the basket helps too yeah I Im telling you cures a lot of ills when you put the ball in the goal middle Brooks turns it over noted Ames missed their last four shots after hitting five of their first six Irish have built this eightpoint lead well theyve hit five theyve missed their last five theyve also turned it over twice Davis with Zona Shrewsberry Roper and Imes on the floor NC States got MJ rice wearing number three transfer from Kansas out there there goes IMS on the drive and got it up on the rim and in Logan Imes just his seventh field goal of the Year pushes the lead to 10 for the Irish wol pack just one of their last seven heres morcel Applause attacking Burns Waits at the table with horn and Middlebrooks misses the jumper thats not the shot theyre looking for the Notre Dame defense so far has been really good at disrupting what North Carolina States trying to do theyre forcing them to do a lot of standing around yep Davis knocked down an early three heres Shrewsberry got Baseline couldnt finish Loops it to Roper and Oh What A Catch of it and then bounced it off of morcel into the Wolfpack bench and so well get substitutions both ways dont forget Saturday afternoon on acc Network a triple dip of mens basketball Virginia NC State get a start in Raleigh at two presented by food line then off to Tallahassee for the hokes and simol and then Duke and Notre name Clos us down in South B 600 eastern time all Saturday all on AC DC Network so Burns Has Come Back Horn has returned to join Dennis Parker Jr and Jaden Taylor has also come back into lineup five to shoot heres Davis with some initiative on the D and score Tay Davis has got seven he averages eight and while Marcus Burtons over there getting a brief rest with Carri Booth noted aim is still hel the rope and expanded the lead now to 12 at 18 to6 M Dame has been able to get inside that NC State Defense something they did very effectively against Virginia Burns is going to draw the keevi foul here be the first on J and the first on the Irish and Davis has been very aggressive early and hes a guy who does a lot of the ball handling for Notre Dame when Burton is out and they just nobody stopped him so heres DJ Burns at the line NC States first trip wpe finds itself 11th in the ACC at just 68 of the stri burns 62 Dan Burns does a lot of things well Russ but youre right the free throw shooting is the best part of his game and one of the best parts of the wolfback game is the ability to apply defensive pressure and Wes subconsciously if Notre Dame continues to drive the ball past him then the North Carolina State Defenders are going to back off a little bit because they dont want to get beat to the goal Burns got one of two the rebound pulled away by Tay Davis and then he turned it over in the back court here is horn well he just decided he didnt want any more of that pressure Parker for horn cant blame him horns calling for it horn will fire and hit DJ horns 36th threepointer of the Year fourth best threepoint shooter in the league coming in thats a quite a weapon to have stepped out of bounds did Marcus Burton that is the third time in this game West that somebody has stepped out of bounds its like theyve Shrunk the court somehow and theres a look at the turnover number there is one big Advantage tonight statistically in this game thats it and michah Shrewsberry knows it Kevin Keats knows it they both are aware of that one figure and what it could mean tonight you see so far its a 43 situation well none of the Notre Dame turnovers have been whoa look out well now thats DJ Burns at his finest and Jaden Taylor hes been struggling to shoot the ball but he wont have any excuse me Dennis Parker had a really good game last time out so its 11 not one it was a 10 on the dunk yes there you go here is Davis skipping it in the corner three ball by Booth bounces away Parker and the Wolfpack trying to turn it up here in transition horn working on Burton its really a nice job by Burton to move his feet Burns sets the screen heres Taylor above the foul line long rebound knocked out horn with a fresh 30 quick trigger and the rebound pulled away by The Freshman Carrie Booth a quick trigger rest but coming off an offensive rebound that threepointer by your threepoint shooter that is not a bad shot here is Burton on the drive and a hand check foul on Jaden Taylor so Taylor will draw his first thats the third and look at Dennis Parker Jr now well who whos this thinking do I need to go and double team Burns and he turns his head and as soon as he turns his head Parker cuts to the basket and DJ Burns Im telling you he can find people that is a really really good pass but an excellent cut yep lead cut to six remember it was 12 a moment ago kesn back door there goes ji and a morel foul I believe and that will be number one on Casey morcel it is the fourth on NC State in this first half of play and again West Notre Dame continues to be able to get the ball inside that North Carolina State Defense and either score or get shots close to the basket Kev ja perfect at the line two shot chance here for the transfer from Penn State and the free throw good dont forget Sunday afternoon on acc Network a full card of womens basketball quadruple header well get you started with number three NC States visit to Virginia Tech starts the day at noon then Georgia Tech in Pittsburgh and then Danny keeps going Florida state is in Clemson at 4 and BC Syracuse at 6 all Sunday all on acc Network settle in thats a thats a really good lineup thats a total settle in event 20 to 12 now a couple of free throws for Jai at the line give him four in this first half long three ball by Parker bounds away and morelo run it down second chance with the wolf packe and a foul on eyeses thatll be his first that is a break for North Carolina State because Parker settled for that three the balls got to move and you can get wide open open threes and fortunately it was a long rebound and they were able to track it down but North Carolina State very out of sorts here early on the offensive end Baseline for Michael oconnell grad transfer from Stanford 76 starts by the way for the Cardinal in his career Palo Alto shot by Burns was short heres Morel teeing from Deep too strong there and the rebound for J Notre Dame back to an eightpoint advantage States missed their last five shots Irish have gone without a field goal for almost three minutes kesn left wide open barries him he was looking everywhere except at the basket and you can hear the crowd basically calling out to him because all he has to do is turn and there was nobody there pushes it to 10 222 Notre a trying to find the vibe again heres horn and it bounces away kesn the rebound and here is burton all the way through the runner with the right hand no basket offensive foul Tony Henderson look right down the pipe and makes the call on Marcus Bert itll be his first third on Notre Dame but Jr kesn was looking around to throw it to somebody crowd finally said shoot and he did 10point lead for the Fighting Irish when we come back to South Music B well you see the Huddle around Micah Shrewsberry his team up 11 232 see the way the ball game is unfolding here I see the two more threes you like the shot selections Notre Dame getting here right I do now they started out five for six wellest so the Irish have cooled off a little bit but their defense has been outstanding the defense has really disrupted North Carolina States half court offense and the key to that is North Carolina state has had to play in the half court offense they have not had transition opportunities michah Shrewsberry visited with us this afternoon he said I want to see if we can get Inc state to come play in the mud with us and to a degree that has worked here in this first half theres Burns thats a strong move and finish for the big fella from Rock Hill first field goal for DJ Burns comes with 644 to go in the first half and he went through that double team and he maintained his patience theres a foul y thats going to be on Michael okon his first Burns catches the ball inside and this is something they havent done Notre Dame they immediately double team him but he he spins to the basket as well as anybody and that time he spun right through that double team nine point game heres Burton working on Jaden Taylor and thats a big man getting through that double team heres Burton thats a long three wow wow eight for Burton thats his second three of the first half and again he comes in as a 25 threepoint shooter so you dont mind if he shoots it but now youre going to have to go out there and cover it heres Burns kicking out of the double team for Jaden Taylors three it spins away heres Burton and now the Irish trying to run three on on three kesn tees one up left it on the front rim Taylor had a shot at it couldnt control it poked Away by J W thats only a good shot by kesn if he makes it uh but Burton now theyre theyre they play off of him a little bit does okell because hes been driving the ball to the basket so effectively thats going to make him much tougher to guard if hes going to make that three heres Taylor pushed by Burton defensively toward that far side Burns finally hands to the young man who transferred from Butler now Burns backing down on ji now Taylor on the drive will score Jaden Taylor from Indianapolis his first points of the game he averages 13 for the wolf pack and he struggled scoring recently particularly from three but that cures a lot of heels when you can get to the basket 10point lead for Notre Dame 519 to play in this first half when Taylor is so aggressive defensively Burton sliding through that traffic heres Imes cutting his J back to IMS out front hell launch and oh it drops straight down into the hands of DJ burs oconnell trying to push the issue Hees is under 20 as well out there from out there this year Taylor reroutes toward the basket back out front for Music heres Burns looking for help tend to shoot here goes the big fell to work Fall Away good wow five for DJ Burns starting to settle in it looks like absolutely people are slapping at him and he just maintains his Music composure eightpoint lead for Notre Dame and thats going to be a foul I think conell it is Dan take us through this Dan because I think people at home will go wait a second hows that on 12 well 12 you cannot run through 14 J sets the screen and he has stopped hes got his position established and oconnell just runs right into it the term that they use for that is blowing up the screen Y and that was a point of emphasis for the officials before the season started you cannot give the defense that Advantage you cant allow an illegal screen but you cant allow the defense to just blast the screener 412 to go in this first half second foul on oconnell first player in the ball game with two Roper back on the floor and heres Davis who got off to a nice start with the drive left it on the front rim Burns and heres the outlet its three on none and woods will lay it in easily and a Mah Shrewsberry time out on the third field goal of the year for cam Woods lead is down to six for noted aame under four to go first half NC State got a freebie here Dan well NC State they M that Notre Dame takes a bad shot but number 20 kesn hes the B last guy hes the defensive balance he cant go running in to get the rebound because that creates a situation like that and interestingly enough that is the first fast break Basket in this game for North Carolina state so you see there 11th in D1 in Fast Break baskets and for the most part Notre Dame has contained that by number one making shots and number two taking good shots so you had a combination of things there it was a bad shot there was not a lot any there was no court Awareness on the part of kesn which is why kesn is now sitting down on the bench where he can watch the court from a different angle and all the concerns Kevin Keats had today have all been checked here in this first half all the things he was talking to his team about the boxes have all been checked right Marcus Burton in the drive and kick game the slowing of the tempo way to handle in the screen game right everything here is B I think hes probably a little surprised that Notre Dame has been able to penetrate his defense so effectively and its not just been Burt Kev J trying to get the ball right back to Burton and does Woods trying to play on the screen ja lost it though in traffic turned over again by the Irish and heres horn very quiet half for horn on the sixth Notre Dame turnover DJ Horns only got five leads him in scoring at 15 a game heres Burns at the foul line bounced out for DJ he and Horn have 10 of the Wolfpack 20 pull up BYOB Burt rattle around and finally scooped up more cell North Carolina State getting into a little bit more transition although Notre Dame doing a nice job getting back fallway jumper Taylor second field goal for Jaden Taylor hes got four its an eight nothing run to get the wolf pack to within four here now Taylors a guy who can score he scored very effectively at Butler and thats something that North Carolina state has they have a lot of guys who can put points on the board Ji see Notre Dame with their five out basically heres rer with tend to shoot all the way through Burton over the top of Taylor and it rattled out for morcel youc State trailing four coming up on two to play morcel spins had a path and couldnt finish rolled around and off the back iron its a nice job to get to the basket in transition Music Shrewsberry the young freshmans 21st three of the Year well hes not a high percentage threepoint shooter but hes a high volume threepoint shooter and so you have to be aware of where he is on the basketball court sevenpoint lead for his dads team now horn trying to find a path jumper no good J the rebound for the Irish its really good defensive job by ji to not go and attack horn and allow horn to drive past but just to get his hand up Roper trying to add to it Applause cant heres Taylor changing gears against Burton gets all the way to the basket cant finish but draws Marcus Burtons foul and thatll be the second on Burton its four on Notre Dame with 125 to play here in the first half Dan and when you miss a threepoint shot like that West then thats almost like a turnover and that allows North Carolina state to get out and go and even though the Irish got back they werent able to set their defense and so really nice job by Taylor to take advantage of that and drive to the basket yep so Jaden Taylor going to go to the line I thought Marcus Burton for a moment was checking out hell stay on the floor with 125 to play sevenpoint lead for Notre Dame Taylor at the line going to shoot two here Jaden on the year is 74 AED 133 points a year ago at Butler misses the free Music throw Kevin Keats has got Taylor from Butler of course horn from Arizona state oconnell from Stanford Middlebrooks from Clemson diara who played earlier from Missouri rice from Kansas and woods from North Carolina AT and Id like to welcome you to college basketball well thats college basketball in 2024 and Kevin Keats is one of those guys whos done an outstanding job retooling his entire roster from year to year yep he hit free agency and did a nice job that ball got knocked away Middlebrook Scoops up the turnover on Notre a sixpoint game ahead of a minute to go Taylor launches long rebound rice couldnt get a hand to it because Boo did a nice job on the box out if youre Notre Dame you dont want to get in an up and down kind of game with North Carolina State but this pressure that the wolf pack is able to apply makes you play faster soda Kevin Keats tried to tell you today he was worried about Matt Zona well Matt Zona is a guy who comes off the bench he only averages two points a game but he is a capable threepoint shooter even though coming in hes only 27 horn knocks down a three got eight he shoots a little better than 27 and its his shooting basically that has kept North Carolina state in this thing Irish have six threes of their 11 field goals in this first half and Booth a catching score for his second field goal thats just a great job by Booth running the court final 10 seconds of this first half eightpoint lead for Notre Dame heres horn to work with four three ball rattled around Boo the rebound and the Irish will take the lead to the locker room Notre Dame started off hot and they finished with an eightpoint lead 3426 at the break lowest score scoring half of the year for the wolf pack stay tuned Luke Hancock Justin Walters the ACC Network halftime report well the Irish who beat Virginia in this building by 20 tonight so felt like when he made an early shot Dan it just kind of lifted everybody and the Irish with the lead remember theyre coming into this ball game with a net of 183 NC States got a net of 68 the Wolfpack has three losses but as you said Dan three losses to Quality teams right very good teams and what you have to do if youre North Carolina state is your defense has to get you back into this but you have to do a better job running your offense Shai Burton Davis kesn and Booth start for Notre Dame and Shrewsberry team heres Davis again going to work in traffic against Morel five to shoot kesn against Parker Jr on the drive stripped of it out of bounds turned over to the Wolfpack Davis has a size advantage against Casey morcel and he was in the lane and kicked the ball out thats one that he needs to turn and shoot it because he had a better shot than they ended up getting in fact they didnt get a shot they kicked it out of bounds B picked up his dribble just beyond the timeline Burns had to help him theres Morel Burton has those two fouls here goes Burns to work on Davis little Up and Under with a left hand rolled off the rim rebound cant finish is Parker kesn and the Irish back in the front court again North Carolina State not able to score close to the Bas heres kesy little shot fake almost traveled with it got it out front here to Burton Marcus Burton terrific cat quick fres looking wow that was a cat quick move but it was totally under control theres horn Runner right hand slapped out Davis Morel Scoops right back into big Burns DJ with a left hand bounds away out of bounds and it will belong to Notre Dame and one more look at Marcus Burton showing you his to kick and remember this is an outstanding defensive player and he just doesnt give up a great jump stop and then that little flip under the basket this is an outstanding play yep and hes in double figures for a seventh straight game now with 10 points the lead 10 for Micah Shrewsberry team heres Burton again trying to shake Burns and Bo tried to clean it up foul on DJ Burns W he didnt Shake Burns but what he did is forced Burns to come and help and that that created an offensive rebound rebounding opportunity for Notre Dame and Burton has really dominated this game so far with his ability to get into the lane here is Carrie Booth The Freshman from Colorado originally was going to Penn State following the footsteps of his dad Calvin and play for Micah Shrewsberry and when the coach left State College to come here Booth changed and now is in South B Indiana his dad was a twotime big 10 defensive player of the year at Penn State one of the terrific defensive post players really of Penn States history I dont think theres any question about that and his son is a little bit skinnier than he was and a better threepoint shooter carry were zero Calvin wore 52 and he was a menace at the iron that ball got knocked around on the Miss and burns tried to make the save itll stay with the wolf Music pack well this is what you call a screen right here and that mcel does a great job with the step back he cant knock it down though heres the double team again nice find Burns to Parker I think if youre going to double team Burns you have to do it while the ball is in the air because if you give him an opportunity to catch and look around and almost turned over Booth collects NC State missed their first five shots before the Parker dunk in fact both of Parkers field goals tonight are dunks had to hammer in the first half and that little twoand flush there Davis with four to shoot hell have to fire away and itll be pulled down by horn michah shuber really doesnt like those contested threes but they really had no choice that time very poor offensive set by Notre Dame look at horn get a screen from Burns floater and DJ horn almost tapped it back in third try from Burns no good how did one get back up there to tip out not sure but booth at the other end misses badly and Burton poked it away might have risk the third foul there going to get away with just knocking it out of bounds well this is a situation where you double team comes and nobody drops down in Burton stayed out on the perimeter and Parker was all alone but again you give DJ Burns a chance to turn that head hes going to find the open Man Dan He the best passing big man in the ACC right now Quinton post is pretty good but DJ burn certainly is does it the most colorful heres Morel on a stick back got it blocked Away by Booth or ji hard to tell through the traffic underneath and NC State beginning to assert themselves a little bit here early in the second half on the offensive boards that wears you down defense you get a stop and you cant get a rebound and theres Burns quickly on the bounce against JN seven for burn turns thats his third field goal the lead seven for the Irish Notre Dames LED all the way tonight NC State is never been in front here at purcel Pavilion at the joy Center Burton out near the timeline hard drive through kesn at three bounced out Parker the rebound I think youll take that every time if youre Notre aame look at Taylor try to find an alley on the hard drive and we draw the foul so a notre name foul going to get us to a break just beyond four minutes into this second half wol pack Trail seven when we continue you know DJ Burns is a guy hes really hard to double team now early in the game the first double team he didnt react well he threw it away but since then when theyve tried the double team him hes had an answer very patient spins gets the ball to the goal makes the shot and then this is one of the things he does best hes an outstanding passer beats the double team and then you know he get really score in Opp post so Burns really a good start to the second half and Wes remember we told you that the wolf pack as you get a look at Burnss numbers tonight had only three assists and 11 field goals in the first half they have two assists and two field goals here in the second theres Jaden Taylor at the line and the first one good Wes and the other thing thats really interesting is North Carolina State despite the fact that they Trail they have 14 more field goal attempts then Notre Dame because they have 11 offensive Applause Music rebounds but the second chance opportuni is only four points thats correct so its just a number unless you can convert them but you keep getting those opportunities eventually its going to tell down to five remember the lead at the break was eight 3732 Burton with a Marcus Haynes move saved it for kesn who scor no could fell off the front of the rim and last Touch by Notre D first of all I dont know how Burton saved it and I dont know how KES missed the layup kesn missed the layup because he was going a little too fast and you could really see North Carolina state has turned up the defensive intensity and the offense now for Notre Dame isnt functioning smoothly Kevin ke no surprise theyre doing it with defense here theyre doing it with defense and offensive rebounds at the moment yep and here is burs rolling on ji missed with the left hand IMS Will Come Away With It Logan Imes trying to size up NC ston transition here a ji isnt a threat from out there and Burns doing a nice job just laying off now heres Burton he is a threat and fouled on the reach by horn I believe Tony Henderson out from underneath and the foul will be on DJ horn itll be his first itll be his second on NC State now Notre Dame has one Kevin Keats who hey what we got a exclusive shot of him sitting on the bench there yes and that doesnt happen does not happen much I have I tell you what before this season is over Im going to try and talk him into wearing a uh podometer on the bench well see how far he walks during the game free throw good by bur dont forget tomorrow night 10 Eastern following a womens basketball double header I have confirmed Kelly gramlick Ivory L and the Hall of Fame coach Muffet McGraw will join Kelsey rigs ladies night on a Thursday 1000 all the action on the womens card gets you ready for a big weekend weve already told you about the quadruple header on Sunday right here on acc Network and always available on the ES app West does Kevin need an odometer didnt if he uses puts his phone in his pocket he give him his steps I dont want to I dont want to confuse the matter okay give him the pedometer put it on the belt and lets see how far he walks in the game I probably would be surprised at how little it is but I think its a lot heres Taylor on the drive and a sevenpoint game rebound put up block from behind thats Roper I think that deflected that stick back back but another offensive rebound created by North Carolina state driving the ball to the basket here is Shrewsberry backing it out were almost 6 minutes into this second half look at Burton weaving now Roper IMS thought about it tend to shoot IMS on the drive back for Burton with seven to shoot against Taylor beat him on the bounce fall away is short and Zona tried to finish it in front of middle Brooks Z needed to grab that one West not try to tip it Music heres oconnell look at Jaden Taylor get to the basket hit Middlebrooks on the trail skip for Taylor step back three back rim Miss for the wolf pack ooh dangerous pass yeah Parker almost solved it heres Burton look at the way he handles the ball Dan and navigates the traffic and scores he faked out two guys and just waited for him to fly by 14 now for Marcus Burton what a very very fine freshman this is for michah Shrewsberry huh well hes really entertaining out front horn sets strong Miss got his own rebound kicks Taylor tries to answer Middlebrooks kept it Applause alive wolf pack trailing nine they got his close as five and looked like that time rer got a hand in there and Horn committed to foul are they going to ticket Roper here it is on Roper itll be his first its the second on Notre name in the Music half I mean when you reach in like that I mean he made contact attack but then this is Burton how about this move two guys go by and then that was horn stepping in right at the end nobody went right right past three guys couldnt stop him yep wol pack is just two of 18 from the floor here in the second half one field goal for Parker on the dunk and burns on the little Bank Shot kick out heres morcel fallway to got it Casey morcel and has four points only one double figure game in his last four Dan coming into tonight and that ball got air mailed by IMS out of bounds and M rwry throws up both hands he he was he was open over there but he didnt want to catch the ball hes Talent Im to dribble it West that two for 18 that you mentioned is really important because if North Carolina State doesnt score its harder for them to set that defensive pressure and you can see they make a basket theyre able to set the pressure and they get a turnover Wolfpack who shot 32 in the loss at Old Miss is at 28 tonight down seven Morel little twoman game with Middlebrooks got trapped seven to shoot oconnell rarely shoots Miss badley and out of their Roper Burton working on cam Woods heres Zona for three got him Wes Im telling you Matt Zona came in shooting three for 11 from out there but hes knocked down two out of three tonight he look like Steve cerr tonight 20 to shoot morcel banged around and draws the the foul well get a couple of free throws for Casey Morel we continue tonight from South B Matt Sona just adding to the Notre Dame barrage from behind the line Irish by Music 10 team has continue to trend from Saturday in their big win against Virginia Dan but now theyre sharing the sugar a little bit more five different guys have hit a three here tonight well Davis has made a three Burton has made a three Shrewsberry has made a three Zona has made a three and the reason I mentioned those particular guys not one of them was shooting above 25 from threepoint range coming in yeah and NC State is suffering through one of its worst nights from the floor theyre only 272 and theyre three of 20 here in the second half and they Trail 10 and the score reflects it 4434 as Casey morcel shoots two after the foul on Zona was his first third on the Irish mikah Shrewsberry has said to anybody who will listen that their defense has been very good when they have struggled its been because they cant score and their defense has been solid tonight and they have scored enough to stay ahead morcel got one of the two got slapped out horn that is now 15 offensive rebounds in this game for North Carolina Morel tried to wrap it to Middle Brooks turned it over thats some play by sure is 11 minutes to go look at BT boy hes got hes got horn backing up and giving ground Dan why he was going so fast he left the ball behind six to shoot for Roper thats a three heres OK Connell way too much dribbling on that possession for Notre D Woods trying to get there on the drive too strong off the glass seen a lot of that from North Carolina State tonight you want to get out you want to play in transition but you dont want to be in such a big hurry the offense is not first guy down the court shoots Davis backs out inside heres Roper scor just do that yep sure did got all the way underneath and then found an allen I thought he was trapped under there yep Irish by 11 NC State just one of their last nine now from the floor W in the NC State defensive pressure which was so intense earlier in the half has backed off a little bit and thats what happens you apply great pressure you dont get results you back off a little bit dont forget ACC PM every afternoon 400 Mark Packer Taylor tanom there to get you caught up on everything going on in the ACC theyll keep the wraps on college football theyll be into basketball PacMan and Taylor 400 ACC pm on accn and always available for you on the ESPN app Burns is back for NC State and DJ with the ball at the Block kevi oh nice pass to Morel were get an Irish foul and thats Davis Tay Davis sophomore from Indianapolis draws his first four on Notre Dame and again DJ Burns showing you what kind of vision he has yep I didnt think there was an opening there but he did heres Burns quick trigger with the left hand rolled off the back rim and burns has missed a couple of those tonight and usually he is solid from that range with that little hook shot Davis keevi kesn Shrewsberry and the Freshman Burton on the floor for Micah Shrewsberry heres Burton here he goes against DJ Burns thats big game hunting now the rebound and chai couldnt finish he got knocked away last Touch by the Irish and the Wolfpack will take over down 11 with 9 minutes to go combined shooting in this second half Dan is seven of 36 wow between these two teams noted a four of 14 NC State is three of 22 wow thats hard to imagine not going to hang that in a l i can tell you that heres more horn the spot up nine to play and an 11point Notre name lead and despite their inability to shoot the ball their defense has kept them in it has kept their lead I should say for Notre Dame well pack one of their last 11 after the Miss there and a foul on horn will be his second three on NC State and what the Notre Dame offense has become here West is they spread the court everybodys standing out beyond the threepoint line and Burton is trying to get the ball into the middle well and as he did on Saturday Micah Shrewsberry has put the ball in the hands of his rookie point guard to not just try and win the ball game but to dictate the gears of the game the speed of the game slow the fast all Music that and Kevin Keats has got his best defensive player by his standard Dan guarding this young freshman theres a screen here goes Burton right hand floater front rim miss oconnell the other way thats a great job by Notre Dame to get back because oconnell was really pushing it heres Burns Quick Pass diara three and okell flies in in there for the rebound and hit the deck hard and Lamar Simpsons got a foul and its going to be on Kevin Jos his second its the fifth on the Fighting Irish Wes if NC State comes back to win this game Notre Dame theyre not going to have to look any further than the fact that they simply have not been able to control their defensive board that time nobody blocked out oconnell Applause heres Burns double team quick skips it away oconnell a three nope the rebound for Applause jot kevs got nine rebounds ties his career high tonight Burton on the bench getting a Applause breather in and around the under eight and theres a turnover by Notre Dame heres Taylor ahead this is diarra went for the dunk and hell draw the foul from kesn Mohamed diara went for style points hell shoot free throws when we continue 11point lead for the Irish well DJ horn came in the ball game averaging 15 hed been on a tear hed had six straight double figure games 20 and three of his last 20 or more in three of his last six its been a hard night at the yard tonight for DJ horn and for that matter DJ Burns too well theyve theyve missed some shots they normally make but I think after credit the Notre Dame defense with putting some pressure on North Carolina state in the second half is shooting 3 for 25 theyre shooting 12 right headed to their worst night of the Year by the way diar will be at the line he is just 10 of 16 this year he is scoreless tonight is the junior transfer from Missouri who who is from Montreal sa Saint in France if you say so Im just telling you okay Im glad to Music Applause know second one good and then this allows him to set the pressure and Burton remember is not in the game so whos going to handle this pressure couple of points for diara lead nine for Notre Dame heres Davis who gave him an early lift in the ball game get started Irish have led all the way and the runner rimmed out that was good defensive help that time again though Notre Dame able to get in the lane heres OK Connell skip for diara trying to take Davis on the drive got it for burns oh boy clears against Zona left hand move off the glass and in for DJ bur nine for the big fella from Rock Hill we showed you earlier now hes now four of 12 but hes missed a lot of those little shots just like that and he usually makes them under seven to play the lead seven for the Irish Booth Shai and Burton wait at the table for Coach Music shuberry heres the coachs son Braden twopointer off the Baseline too strong and now Connell North Carolina state has hung around Wes and theyre still within range here Taylor on the drive I think this is where they have to go they have to play through him Burns left hand again too strong diara tried to keep it alive thats a really good rebound by eyeses loogan Im sneaking Music through ims on the drive left corner Davis rattled out kesn couldnt grab it and burns and IMS a collision in the midcourt area another name want a little bit more out of that from DJ Burns no foul was called partisans here at purcel Pavilion not happy well and and Im head he has suffered from shoulder Music injury and Bill comington and Michel rwry he he wants the referees to look to see if theres a flagrant foul and Im not sure just because that arm comes up you know thats a sort of a natural body reaction right and Im telling you if youre going to run into DJ Burns youre going to feel it the crowd wants a review here and so theyre going to go look at it now Burns you know the arm comes up right at the end but I dont know that did he hit him with that arm right and as you mentioned IMS has missed a couple ball games with his shoulder injury well he tries to get in position hes trying to set a screen right know just because theres a hard Collision doesnt mean that was an illegal play so now remember there was no call made on the floor so theyre allowed to look at this and they cannot decide its a common foul it can only be a flagrant one or flagrant 2 and I just you know I just a flagrant file is contact that is excessive Andor unnecessary and I I just I didnt see either one there of course Im not the guy who decides you got Tony Henderson and Bill Covington Jr at the Monitor and they cant go over there and look and decide okay that was an legal screen okay that it has to be either a flagrant one or a flagrant 2 and Im just not sure it rises to that severity so and now the other discussion here will occur with our Trio of officials Well normally when you have a discussion thats this long theyre going to decide its a flagrant foul and Kevin Keats that is a look of disbelief on his face so all right here were going to go Tony Henderson come over and tell Dan what the situation is screen his arm comes up after the contact its not flagrant its not illegal screen its nothing Tony Henderson all right well what you speculate well they agreed with me its not an IL legal screen it was a stationary screen its not illegal hes stationary gets himself established the arm comes up thats not flagrant its nothing here goes Burns skip out Ball moving for Taylor nice recovery by by the Irish Taylors floater too strong diara recovers and draws the foul another offensive rebound thats now 17 offensive rebounds which is a season high for the wolf pack in offensive boards so the foul is on carry Booth only his first but it is seven on Notre Dame so for 540 to go in the next couple of common fouls no two shots here for diara weve talked about how well the Notre Dame is played defensively West but your defense doesnt stop until you have the ball free throw good his third Point dont forget Saturday afternoon triple header on ACCC Network well get you started with the wack in Virginia presented by food line at two then the hokes and seminal in Tallahassee nice win tonight for Florida State and then Duke will be here in South Bend to see the Irish all on acc Network and available always on the ESPN app the lead is five diara is four for fourth the line here in the second half this is as close as North Carolina state has been in a while and theyve never LED tonight on the Drive Burton and Lamar Simpson a foul on the perimeter and that is against oconnell third on Michael oconnell fourth on the Applause Wolfpack that was a break that the foul occurred on the drive because morcel was back there waiting for him that could have easily been Char yep Notre Dame Leed all the way tonight they won two straight including a 22point win here against Virginia on Music Applause Saturday here is Burton and burns knocked it away but it ended up in the Irish bench and mikah shrewbury said sometimes Burton gets a little bit impatient he needed to go around d DJ Burns not try to split in between DJ Burns and Taylor heres the inbounds and now Burton with tend to shoot hes going to put it down and go got beat Burns and that got knocked away and that was last touched by Tay Davis di got a hand on it but Davis then flicked at it 11th Irish turnover with 510 to play very very few things have gone well for North Carolina State tonight but you have to tip your hat to them they have not stopped playing Applause Music yep five minutes to go morcel working on rer left it on the iron and a whistling foul underneath and Bill comington Jr on DJ Burns there I think on burns y yep DJ Burns third on the big fella fifth on the Wolfpack this is what you call clear out here DJ Burns number number 30 M screen he just bounces G right out of the way keba is 254 by the way DJ is 69 275 well DJ is listed at 275 you know though respect the fact that 275 is the number 275 is is big enough thats it fivepoint game MRE Dame I think in desperate need of a score here Burton against oconnell thats a tough match up for o con middle Brooks out there to spell Burns and now heres rooper boy di on the switch six to shoot now heres Davis against morcel at the foul line kesn the rebound press 20 for the Irish hell get it back to number three here in the white jersey hell take oconnell fall away right of the lane eight for Burton in the the half 16 in the ball game what a great job creating space for that jump shot and then he made it despite the fact that Taylor came over to help lead is seven for the Irish under four to go here tonight in South Bend Taylor to answer does with a triple Jake Taylor hits just the third three of the night for the wolf pack and the first not belonging to DJ horn and Taylor had missed over the last couple games 18 of his previous 19 threepoint attempts so that is a big shot first double figure scorer of the night for NC State is the Junior from Indianapolis fourpoint game three and a half to Applause Music go in the corner rer seven to shoot heres Burton against diara Fall Away off a jump stop good I dont know how you guard that 18 for the Freshman sixpoint lead again for Notre Dame heres Taylor through traffic cant finish the scoop wanted to foul didnt get it that was a really tough shot Wes I mean hes trying to be aggressive and I understand that but you cant go in there looking for the foul theara has got to find somebody to help against Burton here hes got to play off of it Burton going to stop pop and diar claims the rebound now thats about his as well as varara can do what a pass oconnell and Middlebrooks draws the foul crowd wanted to travel not going to get it 328 to go and we might be going to the wire sixpoint game Jaden Taylor knocks down a deep three and then at the other end Marcus Burton Right to Work young freshmans got the Irish up six when we come back well its a sixpoint lead for no not Dame 238 to play as the Irish break the Huddle around Micah Shrewsberry Notre Dames LED from the jump tonight Dan well and they have maintained the lead despite the fact that the second half shooting has not been very good for either team but look at those offensive rebounds for NC State 17 offensive rebounds however West Kevin Keat guys have only been able to convert those into eight points Ben Middlebrooks will be at the line the foul was on rer as we went to Music break and Wes interestingly here we havent seen DJ horn in a while its ok Connell who has been running the point guard duties for North Carolina State one and one from middle Brooks is good hes a good free throw shooter yep and we did notice Wes you and I were talking about it when DJ horn came out to start the second half he had a back brace wrap on so he might be having some back problems middle Brook second cleanly through hes got four tonight and West Notre Dame has been ahead this whole game but its its down to a fourpoint game again little backourt pressure two and a half to play kesn ahead for Davis and Jr going to handle it against Morel they want to get it to Burton and finally they do but theres only 13 seconds left on the clock yep theres Davis trying to help with the screen and heres the switch for diara now kesn with five to shoot against oconnell in front of the goal scores thats really a good play by kesney he has a couple inches height Advantage just his second field goal of the night hes got five points Morel tries to get all the way through and does on the layup so Casey morcel and a timeout for Kevin Keats Caseys got seven the lead is four again we take a break in s in well Burton gets it into the front Court as we rejoin you from South Bend theres a reach around on Jaden Taylor his second the sixth on NC State won I think thats a big key thats the only the six team foul and on the next foul of course its one and one so it looks like the Irish are going to have to make some free throws here down the stretch and into Burton with Jaden Taylor defending Applause heres Burton again tend to shoot now wheres the screen its kesn helping got to be careful you dont set an illegal one four three on the clock Burton lost it on the dribble about Jaden Taylor thats just outstanding defense by Jaden Taylor 12th turnover on the Applause Irish NC states only got nine points tonight off the previous 11 Notre names LED all the way heres Taylor and thats a foul on kesn and Taylor might have sold it Just a Touch third on kesn all in the half nine on Notre name one and one for the junior transfer from Butler and this is a situation where kesn he I mean he goes right into him Wes and Taylor May sold it but he I mean he ran right into him Jai comes out Tay Davis comes in Notre Dame downsizing Dan I think theyre worried about handling the ball heres Taylor Taylors pretty good free throw shooter 74 four for five as he hit that one played 65 games in two years in Indianapolis for Butler did Jaden Taylor and the second one good so hes now got seven and a half dozen in the ball game twopoint game close as its been since we started tonight minute five to go roer bringing it into the front Court rer looks a little tentative dribbling that ball and he shouldnt be against Dr heres middle Brooks against Tay Davis wheres Burt with 10 to shoot Shrewsberry going to help with the screen now Davis trying to go to work on the drive and were going to get a foul on morcel I think yes casy morcel draws his second that is seven now on NC State and one and one well Wes this is what were talking about Notre Dame has led the entire game and now theyre going to go to the free throw line and Davis you know hes a 70 free throw shooter but one and one here twopoint game youre laughing at Burns I am laughing at Burns yeah he comes in the crowd booze and he starts taking them on yeah come on keep the booing heres Davis one and one Dan told you 26 of 37 at the line and the free throw bounces away and oconnell the rebound so the front end of the one and one under a minute 45 seconds to go Wolfpack hasnt LED tonight Taylor for the lead lead and it went over the glass was it deflected no it was not deflected NC State was trying to sell that it was deflected it was not with 382 left so now here comes Shrewsberry back on the floor they take keevin ji off the floor and burns goes off the floor and Middlebrooks comes on you know I Taylor that was a very difficult shot and I dont think were looking at the replay there oh theyre going to look now Im not sure anybody touched it but we within the last 2 minutes and the officials can go over and see who knocked the ball out of bounds Music so so this is Taylor driving into the lane and and this league had a pretty good start to the season somehow another though it hasnt quite translated to the National perception at least as we start conference play W uh you know thats one of the things that drives me nuts because the ACC I mean has some really good wins in the nonconference portion of the schedule and it its going to be its going to Notre ball Notre Dame but thats thats a perception the ACC has been fighting for the last couple years Wes and the last couple years everybody says Where The accs Down but still the conference teams have won 21 games in the NCA tournament more than anybody else y tell you what the Leagues got a nine and3 Mark against the Big 12 now which is regarded as the best league in the country at least through the first month of change heres a double team on Burton in the back court Shrewsberry picks it up and what do we have there a foul called oh kesn timeout was called so kesn did call a timeout and Mike Shrewsberry is like Music okay and I think he wanted to know where he gets the basketball so well step aside kesn called the timeout near the fenetic faceing the back court well this is a situation where Jr kesn he is going to call time out because hes afraid theyre going to get a 10second violation now they got it across half court in plenty of time but Wes one thing that timeout does is it buys Notre Dame an additional 10 seconds theres only 24 seconds left on the clock but they have now 10 more seconds to get it over got about a 9sec differential shot clock to game clock here so NC state does not have to foul Dan down only two here oh boy what a dangerous pass kesn thats a travel sure is called by Lamar Simpson right in front of the Notre Dame bench and that is an outstanding job by North Carolina state to keep the ball out of Burtons hands and this is a situation where kesn just doesnt get stopped he needs to do a jump stop and he didnt do it so the wolf pack going to take a timeout and DJ Horns going to come come back in the ball game when we Music continue well you see the Huddle for Kevin Keats DJ horn by the way went back to the table as the we began the timeout Dan hell be on the floor for the wol Haack who now has the shot clock off you see the game reset Wes youre down by two points so youre not going to try to holding for the last shot where North Carolina state has had success is attacking the basket getting those offensive rebounds and Horn hes obviously in the game for his threepoint shooting ability and Horn we mentioned hes been out of the game for a long time West and so since hes back in the game now I dont think it was an injury issue I just think Kevin Keat slot they were playing better with okon handling the point yep well and hes the wolfback head coach quick to tell you oconnell is the best distributor of the basketball we have and now oconnell is going to stay on the floor with more cell horn Taylor and burns well now Notre Dame has nine fouls so if they commit a foul then its going to be two shots not one in one North Carolina state only has seven fouls so any foul that they might commit its a non shooting fou will be a one andone for Notre Dame crowd to their feet here at purcel Pavilion Applause heres Taylor Taylors been effective attacking the basket but this is where youre going Burns rolling on J left hand we tie DJ Burns now with 11 in the game on his fifth field goal 14 seconds left kesn to put it in play and its Burton weaving through traffic rolls it over heres Roper and a foul called on Taylor with 83 left and thats the eighth on NC State so one and one for Roper who is a 58 free throw shooter Wes this is I mean thats why DJ Burns is in the game in this kind of a situation thats where youre going with the ball he collects the two points and Taylor wasnt trying to foul him but in that situation you foul a 58 free throw shooter it might turn out to be okay and here is diara to the table and hes going to replace Taylor youre looking for a rebound here West well NC States got one timeout left in a tie game at 52 free throw by Roper no good okon going to run it down with six five heres OK Connell front court and Kevin Keats a timeout in the dead break I thought oconnell was getting ready to deliver the pass to Jaden Taylor and instead a timeout is called NC State will be out of them and and have the ball with 36 left you know Notre Dame has done such a great job but theyve missed the last two front ends of the one and one sure have Davis and now Roper Dan yep so what do you like here you got all is it DJ Burns Im going to DJ Burns now of course everybody in the building knows that they want to go to DJ Burns but DJ Burns catches it so well inside North Carolina State the if you dont go to Burns the other thing is I think I give the ball with Taylor and have him drive it to the basket dont have a lot of time to drive with 36 left now remember two we had a conversation today with michah shrewbury about the ability to put booth and Davis both on the floor together does he do that for this last possession Dan with DJ Burns in the game like this well hes got ji in the game and Davis in the game there you go and so Booth is not in the game I think theyre worried about the strength Factor but Davis is 69 ke but GI at 610s got a careerhigh rebounding wise tonight and Burton is out of the game hes got four points but 11 rebounds and Davis is going to defend the inbounds pass all right so Taylor is the guy whos going to inbound the Music ball you got horn theyre going to put 4 seconds even on the clock okay so you got horn and morcel who are both very very good threepoint Shooters Taylor to put it in play live for burns DJ on the roll up under layup good one1 of a second left and DJ Burns Music Applause Dan how about that how about this huh well I mean theyre trying theyre not trying to throw it to him but I mean hes the last Resorts they just throw it up there nobody comes to double team and Im telling you he is so good hes so agile what a great pivot and then he just steps right through NC State leads for the first time tonight with one tenth of a second to go in the ball game and the officials are going to look and make sure that one1 of a second is right but remember if its 310 of a second or less Notre Dame cant catch the ball but all they can do in this situation is tip it so you need at least 4 T of a second to catch and shoot and Lamar Simpson and Bill cumington Jr over Applause to get this squared Music away West Notre Dame they shot the ball very well in the first half and we said their Achilles heel this year has been their inability to score and in the second half even though they played really well defensively they werent able to score and particularly missing the critical front ends of the one and one down the stretch so Notre Dame theyre going to put 610 of a second 6 T of a second okay well that changes everything that changes everything you have enough time to throw it in and take a shot you dont have enough time to do anything else youve got to throw it into the back court so lets take a look the clock is supposed to stop when the ball goes through the basket and that 610 of a second is right the ball is through the basket at 610 let me tell you this we have played Four conference games tonight which takes us to a total of 17 so far in ACC play theres been one game five points or lesser overtime prior to tonight NC State played that against Boston College Dan and the wolf packs at it again trying to secure another ACC Road win here tonight they won it Chestnut Hill in overtime and now DJ Burns has given them the lead for the first time tonight with 60 T of a second left Wes you dont have enough time you catch the ball maybe one dribble and then you let it go its got to be kesn its got to be something near the midcourt line right well zone is obviously in there cuz he can throw the ball Justin roer is at the basket in to our left heres Zona uncontested throw tap and over the inline out of bounds and the final wow is 5452 NC State on the D J Burns basket with 610 of a second left the wolf pack go to 2 and0 in the ACC they go to 10 and three on the year and those two conference wins are both on the road great to be with Dan boner thanks to our producer Derek Coman our great crew here tonight in South bent now lets go to Justin Walters and Luke hanock
