to really fit in in this offense for uh for Clemson In fact Joe Gerard Mike is playing his 150th collegiate game tonight after four years at Syracuse and this season for the Tigers And having just scored his 20000 points at this former school a win on the road at the dome Its part of the threeame winning streak for the Tigers This is Shefflin needs a safety valve goes inside cheering and he found his open man and Chase Hunter working underneath the hoop Well Brad Rell talked about it that you cant necessarily run your offense against NC State and hes going to have to rely on guys to make cheering plays and uh Shefflin kept his composure DJ Burns with a nifty turnaround for two Now its going to be fascinating to watch how they play Burns They decided early on to not double team him That look is going to change over the a game Hes got incredible touch for the big man inside for NC State Berno 69 275 cheering lbs from Rock Hill South Carolina as the graduate student in the starting line of NC State cheering And here now first of all you saw now Shaplin is going to be guarding him Hell see different cheering different people And uh boy its just right to him to what you do if you double team him He is excellent at picking out people on the perimeter Very good passer out of the double team He averages close to 12 points per game Nifty dribble from Hunter Attacks the defense Knocked away cheering and he got it back Second chance Gerard Little show and go to Hunter behind the line for three cheering Shefflin up over the top but he knocked it out of bounds fighting with Michael Okonnell Well Burns really loves to work this left box and uh hes got all hes got really positive solid moves down there No double team a lot of team a lot of time to work You saw him take a look around make sure he had that time to operate NC State did not play a midweek game Their last game was last Saturday at Wake Forest A loss 8379 That pass deflected nearly intercepted Morcel grabbed it and the shot clocks at five cheering And that time they got Burns pushed off the block and they came on the dribble Got the ball out of his hands Clemson just one of four shooting to start This is Gerard Course correction Lost the handle and turned it over Horn one on three Elevates bounces off the rim Good hustle back by Jack Clark Mike and then the Tigers turn it over Well and hes been a huge addition for Clemson to get him healthy and talked about you know a guy who played for NC State last year and Ben Middlebrooks playing for State who was down here But uh yeah Clark being healthy has cheering really been a big addition for them Two early turnovers from the Tigers and head coach Brad Brown All in his 13th season Last year they played in the NIT with 23 wins finished third in the regular season standings in the ACC a season ago and eliminated NC State in the quarterfinals of the tournament last year DArras coming off a double double against Wake and uh trying to force things early Its interesting cheering that they got hes guarding DJ Hall and Hall is a little bit more perimeter oriented I think thats the match up youll see rather than Burns guarding him cheering 36 made threes on the season now for PJ Hall 31 from beyond the arc This is Burns midrange and hes got the touch early Mike Yeah three of three so far Three of four actually Three of three But um you know I I think for Clemson theyd rather see him shoot the jump shot Less likely to pick up a foul that way ball again LAUNCHING THE THREE AND THE RESULT is the same And is the guy I mean hes got to get out and at least get a hand up and cheering challenge that jump shot BJ Hall over 1500 career points cheering over 500 career rebounds Shot comes out of the corner on the weak side after the cheering miss from Okonnell Hunter runs it up Hunter driving down the lane cheering off the backboard and in He really does a nice job of absorbing the contact that time but really negates cheering ability to block the shot Hunter had a game high 20 points in the win against Miami on Wednesday at home for the Tigers here at Little John Coliseum where theyre nine and three on the season cheering Shot clock winding down for Burns Morel was the cutter Shiplin met him in midair and a foul called DJ Burns has racked up six early points shooting from all different angles And PJ Hall a couple of threes and a fourpoint lead for the Tigers This Sunday the Wolfpack are coming to CW womens hoops Say Rivers does it all for number six NC State as they welcome Georgia Tech to Raleigh CW

Built to serve Back in Clemson South Carolina the Tigers have an early 106 lead against visiting NC State Almost 5 minutes into our first half Brad Brownell and the Tigers trying to string together four straight wins two of those on the road in the ACC Morcel will be going to the free throw line He was fouled by Shefflin moments ago And this and this is something that Kevin Keys talked to us about that Morcel really needs to attack the basket more not shooting the three ball especially well cheering in the last month Seventh year for Kevin on that NC State bench Free throw is good Or as Po from the new movie Kung Fu Panda 4 might say Scadoo Dont miss Kung Fu Panda 4 Only in theaters March 8th It makes sense I mean Morcel 83 from the line So you know you struggling from the perimeter get into a little bit of rhythm at the line then maybe you can expand your game He had nine points in the loss on the road last Saturday at Wake Forest but missed both of his three opportunities Couple of free throws Morel into the box score And a lot a lot of work in practice against the press and they turned it over Deploying that pressure Horn around the rim and out to Hall And Horn who has not missed much in the last four games has started 02 so far Horn is up over 52 shooting coming into tonight over those last four matchups Mike And the same from three as well I mean hes playing as well as any guard in the country in this stretch 16 of 32 on threes for Horn trying to defend Cant do it Dylan Hunter has the bucket for Clemson cheering Good size of just under 64 Can go into the lane score over people Younger brother of Chase Hunter Horn comes back with a three Kevin keeps telling us he just he needs somebody to step up with him Just so much pressure on Horn to perform 24 25 points a game over this last stretch Hes the graduate student from Raleigh Mike returning to the Pack program Paul looking for a little heat check Hes made a couple of threes already in the game Not this time cheering into the corner and thatll be a three in front of the Clemson bench Diara he was he did not come in shooting a big number but he was two of two against Wake So you know did make some a couple of baskets I mean before that he was uh five of 22 He didnt miss a shot against Wake Mike 13 points 12 boards a double double and he was five for five from the floor cheering At the other end Godfrey trying to muscle his way in Had it knocked away Middlebrooks got a piece of that one NC States on a 6 run trying to increase that run and they will Morcel hit the deck and scored And Marcel has really taken coach Keiths words to heart and he has been effective in the lane First field goal for Morcel Hes got four points Brad Barnell was very complimentary of Middle Brooks and hes doing what he did here Hes very physical a presence inside Made a good defensive play the last time Paul hands it off to Hunter with the shot clock at six to the free throw line on the turnaround Dylan Hunter comes in a just for three points a game but hes been a factor so far cheering Two for two from the floor exceeding his season average of 27 points per game as Mike mentioned cheering cheering Marcel with the kick out Horn is way behind the line and he rips the ropes for the pack Remember I said about 0 for two He heard you Michael Yeah its a distant memory Couple of recent threes for DJ Horn And that one could have been 27 ft away at least Well Diara is really paying attention to Hall now cheering Clark comes back with a three cheering and applause Hes not a big threepoint shooter either Mike No 25 I was going to say thats not has been not been a big part of his game cheering Just his eighth made three of the season for Jack Clark Horn again straight away and he does it again you know And Dylan Hunter just kind of hung his head after that shot Hes chasing chasing DJ Horn all over the court Got a hand up on the shot and theyre like What are we going to do here Horn is now three of four on threepoint chances and nine points cheering fight after the miss and a foul against Horn So DJ Horn just picked up his first personal foul His shooting on point straight away for three and the pack is in front Oh you have never faced anything like this The chameleon is power of all my old nemesises Niasai We have to get an army of the best crooks and criminals Oh youre

what Ive been looking for Mhm Oh my gosh I know How is this stuff so good Hidden Valley Ranch Are you serious about flavor Youre watching ACC basketball on the CW brought to you by Ram Trucks built to serve DJ Horn Mike is built to shoot the three NC State has gone out in front by five and Horn has three made threes in the game Yeah he struggled very early but you know a guy on a run like that hes going to come alive and uh just incredible shooting Hes the one who led this charge back into the lead leaving his defenders shaking their heads Although I tell you Clemson caught a break He picks up a cheap foul right there on an air ball and a hold So maybe a chance to get another second one get him maybe over onto the bench PJ Hall to that bench for the Tigers Hes got a couple of made threes in this game so far and that accounts for his six points Shefflin stepping back offensive glass just a little too strong from Chanty Wiggins right there One he definitely should have converted and you know he missed the shot but it was good to Shefflins been at least aggressive looking for his three Mrs Horn had to give it up Horn had a chance to tie the game in regulation last Saturday at Wake and missed a jumper Sends it inside Middlebrooks position basket and foul Wiggins was defending and picks up the foul for Clemson This all started There was confusion right there There three guys on that Its supposed to be a double team It was a triple team and he was late getting back to Middlebrooks inside That was just blown coverage from the start So Horn will get a breather Stepping out with nine points and three made threes Middlebrooks at the free throw line 68 on the season and an old school threepoint play He did not score Mike last Saturday in 10 minutes off the bench at Wake Yeah I mean you know hes hes going to give you five points four rebounds some you know really physical play inside Not I pumped it hot popping numbers but hes going to be consistent Hunter catch and release front rim DJ Burns the clearance cheering Bron pass into the game Number 10 in red and black Morcel from the corner for three Weak side fight Middle Brooks is there That foul is going to go against NC State Godfrey was there for Clemson First on Middle Brooks Wiggins goes to that Clemson bench Tigers have won three in a row including the win Wednesday at home against Miami And then on the road at Syracuse at North Carolina Mike theyve won four of their last five games That win in Chapel Hill just the second all time for the Clemson program And that was coming after a stretch where they had really gone stagnant It was a home loss against Virginia that they bounced back from on the baseline up and under Josh Bele cheering and applause Really kind of poorest defense by NC State that time giving up the baseline drive Burns is not really a shot blocker out there He takes up a lot cheering of space but does not protect the rim Its not a bad switch up for Clemson to go zone I mean Shot clocks at five Morel slams on the brakes and misses Shefflin reaches for it Especially with Horn not on the floor you really can contest NC State from the perimeter Shefflin the leading rebounder for the Tigers this season Nine and a half per game is third in the ACC Spin move and two RJ and the foul Pretty nifty move inside Goes takes the middle I mean hes just kind of using a Burns move against Burns Good spin back inside using his quickness We talked about hes not a shot blocker Got to the body Godfrey just 48 of the season from the stripe Might have been Middlebrook stepping in early to the dismay of coach Keats cheering Godfrey gets to reload Sophomore from Swani Georgia Shefflins going to check out PJ Hall coming in I mean you just you gave them a point right there You got a 48 free throw shooter You got a lane violation Chances are hes going to miss Why get you know why even lean in in that situation Horn in there for NC State leads everybody so far with his nine points Wants to add to the total That bounces off Middle Brooks comes flying in to knock it around and he got it back against against zone A little tougher to to rebound out of The former Tiger sends it out on the perimeter cheering up top of the board Godfrey Its stolen right back and Horn scores Just very opportunistic Went right on Hes just immediately switched over to defense and a lazy pass 20th time this season horned to double digits Clemsons now turned it over five times Zero turnovers so far for NC State No they theyre one of the best in the country after an early flurry The three has dried up so far for Hall cheering Burns drops it low Great look by Burns to Taylor and there was a foul on the play as well Chase Hunter trying to catch up So Jaden Taylor Burns found him and hes going to the free throw line when we come back You thought you knew Cuomo See the game my friends Expose the game The real Chris just might surprise you so you can change the game Surprising The

Panthers Then in prime time Florida State looks for the upset against tournament hopeful Clemson right here Little John Coliseum CW court Saturday Next week 530 pm Eastern 230 pm Pacific Its only on the CW Virginia had won 23 straight at home rank losing earlier this week to bit cheering and they got the win against weight Theyre one of three teams ranked out of the ACC along with Duke and North Carolina And the storyline for me in that game coach Tony Bennett picking up a technical foul which he hadnt done since 2010 cheering I have to text him and see what he said They got the win and they did coach credit That was probably the most important thing and a typical both teams under 50 We saw them get a win cheering on the road at Florida State last Saturday And thats got inside for the Tigers And theyve had some guys come in to give them a nice offensive lift off the bench cheering By the way game one of CW courtside Saturday was a win for Georgia Tech at home against Syracuse 6560 cheering Shot clocks at 10 for Burns over Hall Misfires Pack gets it back with Taylor spinning Godfrey tracks it down to the baseline Despite that miss Mike NC State at 50 shooting the Tigers at 53 here in our first half Hall three ball Yeah And his his misses have been short too since that early flurry cheering NC State trying to snap a twoame losing streak Two and five in their last seven games Morcel second effort and he got fouled a group of Tigers around him that included Josh Beetle I respectfully disagree It really is You know I I looked at his numbers and its been a prolonged drought from three You know 20 over his last 13 cheering games and he was magnificent last year 41 on the year cheering Coming up on the Subaru halftime report well get a recap from that game I just mentioned Syracuse and Georgia Tech from Atlanta will remember coach Lefty Drielle passing away today at the age of 92 ACC legend first half highlights and stats Its all coming your way from Tiger Town cheering cheering And thats a rare sight for Morcel 83 missing both ends NC State as a team Mike 72 from the line Thats 10th in the ACC Into the back court off the deflection Hunter went back to get it Gerard for three Joe Gerard cheering First points of the game for Gerard Diara the other way and hes got a three of his own I dont necessarily know even though he was two for two against Wig I dont know that that was part of Brad Barnells scouting report that you had to really check the arrow from three Came into the game a 29 threepoint shooter but its not that its a number that he had taken just 24 prior to tonight This is Hall backing down And that I I think for Tom I think for the next for you know few minutes he needs to go back inside get some rhythm and then work back out Eight points now for PJ Hall inside of five minutes to go in our first half of play cheering The lead is four for NC State Morcel cheering free throws coming up for Morcel as he took a tumble Hall picked up the foul cheering Yeah ladies and gentlemen there theres a price to pay for bringing this game to you in the wherever youre watching cheering Well done Held his position although he was in the restricted area Yes he was So Marcel back to the free throw line Our people do a fabulous cheering job Great look from right behind that back Dive into the nations most shocking mysteries Catch the series premiere of the allnew CW original true crime series Crime Nation this Tuesday February 20th 87 central only on the CW He probably hasnt missed three in a row since the third grade That is a crime cheering Morcel missing at the free throw line cheering Much better there Five of eight as a team on free throws for NC State in the first half Clemson has only gone to the line once and made it Gerard pass deflected by Morcel Stays with the Tigers 13 to shoot Ill tell you the other thing too that may be bothering Paul on the perimeter Jiara has done a much better job defending him out there He struggled a little bit early but I think hes getting the hang of defending a big who can shoot the three By the way Mike Joe Gerard has now made 30 70 threepointers Hall tries to take it inside He got denied Pretty good defensive job inside as well Morcel defender on his hip cheering Horn guarded by Clark and a carry against Horn cheering The first turnover of the first half by NC State and that one unforced Its just a a poor ball handling error NC State forces almost 14 turnovers against the opposition Third best in the conference Gerard catch and shoot cheering Okonnell one on three Got the bounce Nobody really stopped the ball so he kept on pushing right to the rim No shot blocking back for Clemson No bigs Michael OConnell Mike the transfer from Stanford Played 89 games

early six points Mike Yeah he got the offense going for the Packer early Six quick points for him They really went to the post PJ Hall some early threes cheering got Clemson off to a fast start And then it was DJ Horn Didnt take him long Hes the games only double figure scorer at this point 11 points three of five from behind the ark cheering Hes now up to 326 career made threes for DJ Horn transfer from Arizona State and Illinois State Played at Trinity Christian in Raleigh This his first year in the NC State program for DJ Horn playing his 145th career college basketball game Gerard had it knocked away by Morcel in midair Heres Horn NC State at 54 shooting as a team in this first half cheering way above their season average Mike of 44 high degree of difficulty did not get the bounce Gerard out ahead The difference really has been the free throw line Jack cheering Clark let the defender fly on by fighting for the rebound with Diara NC State basketball cheering Burns turn around Diara got it away from Shefflin cheering Hall came over to defend and help and a foul is called PJ Hall thats his second So hell be out for the last 229 of the uh of the half And and really I mean the difference of this game and it could very well be a 10point game this year or this half Morcel was shooting at his average from the line Diara 64 from the free throw line NC State is five of eight as a team in the game Coming off the double double last Saturday in the losing effort at Wake Forest for tomorrow on CW womens hoops Georgia Tech heads to Raleigh to face national title contender NC State Georgia Tech and number six NC State tomorrow noon Eastern 900 am Pacific only on the CW Well all things considered I mean NC State has has really kind of kept PJ Hall the miss there in check and and Ian Shefflin has not scored in the first half yet so their front line really kind of neutralized No points and a couple of boards for Shefflin This is Hunter Clark Godfrey the collapsing D on Godfrey Nowhere to go Shot clocks at five Hunter an escape dribble back iron So were inside of two minutes to go in our first half Hor is the only player in double digits with 11 Burns against two defenders He goes down Whistled and foul on a move by Burns cheering Clark picks up his first foul for the Tigers Hes the former Wolfpack player So Burns at 58 from the free throw line this season You know you know its funny Tom and uh you know Brad Brownell told us about how difficult it is to run your offense against NC cheering State He said its going to be come down to guys making plays and guys havent made a lot of plays in this first half and a lot of what theyve tried to do or theyve had to make some difficult shots and they havent you havent done a lot of it Burns has a chance to make it a 10point lead This lead is the largest of the half for NC State That one rolls out of bounds Hunter couldnt hang on to it Just I mean you look at the body language right now for for Clemson They just kind of look out of sorts at this point Thats six turnovers now in the first half Horn Tiara over the top He lost it on the way up Theyre getting 5050 balls Theyre getting offensive rebounds Theyre on a mini 6 run Okonnell working baseline Morel chisels his way through that Clemson defense Cannot complete the play And heres Godfrey Gerard A mismatch here Just a slight mismatch Gerard lets it fly and knocks it down for three cheering And Gerard gets up and he is hobbling a little bit cheering applause Just favoring that right leg ever so slightly trying to walk it off cheering Clemson had gone over cheering four minutes without a field goal prior to the Gerard three his second of the game cheering Burns will back it down on Godfrey The help came in from Clark and he knocked it away cheering 30 seconds to go in the half About 8 seconds differential cheering Hunter Free ball from Hunter cheering Time out NC State N and 12 seconds to go in cheering the first half Tell you what for that was a massive answer for Clemson in the last 50 seconds just went on a 6 run with those threepointers Cutting into the 10point lead Gerard gets it started straight away Yeah they just kept backing up I mean theres no nothing that Burns could do on that play Huge answer And there they had nothing going their way up to that last two shots Those two shots accounting for a 60 run and just 57 seconds for the Tigers at NC State not hit a field goal in over three and a half minutes They led 3929 seems like just a moment ago Largest lead of the first half and Clemson able to cut into that lead with 9 and a half seconds to go in the first half Yeah Tom this could easily be a 12 or 14 cheering point game going in the half Im right You know right now Ive got Ive got one and a half guys on DJ Horn Somebody else got to make a shot cheering cheering scorers table Clarence Armstrong Brent Hampton also part of our officiating crew Theyre just confirming a previous three and its been upheld So the score remains 3935 cheering Just two seconds on the clock Horn stepping back launches a three That will not cheering get there Wiggins might have got a piece of it So thatll do it for the first half NC State goes to the locker room avoid that third one here early at least for the first five to eight minutes or so looking at DJ Burns who got off to an early start in the first half See if Clemson or if NC cheering State goes to him try to force the action a little bit Burns had eight points in the first half We told you DJ Horn led the way with 11 Hes the only player in our game so far in double digits in scoring This is Burns forcing the issue and scoring It was interesting and there were there was a lot of dribbling by him in that possession They should have dug in a little bit giving Hall some kind of help Double figures for the 19th time this season for Burns First basket for Shefflin in the game Desperately need him get him going Gerard cheering comes up with it on the run pass two defenders Rolls it up on the rim Got it to fall Gerard still down underneath the basket momentarily Hall is as well He and he and PJ Hall ran into one another Yeah they Well he Joe Gerard got the basket and took the worst of that by a lot I think he was just trying to avoid the falling debris after the play he made Trying to shake it off Great drive by Gerard Shed a couple of defenders and was able to lay it up and in Hes up to eight points now First conventional field goal for Gerard on the drive Now the officials are going to the scorers table as well Clarence Armstrong and Ron Groover over at the table The defender is more Shefflin Diara Morcel there Theres Hall coming over the top I think what happened not a foul but I think he if you look Burns came in after the play and it looked like his knee kind of ran into Gerard just following after the play It was contact with Hall as well So when Hall fell he contacts the back of the head of Gerard No it was it was Burns Theres Burns as well Yeah its all happening fast cheering So nothing comes of it A lot of contact and just score the bucket for Gerard If you ask Gerard I think something came of it but Well he appears to be okay which is good news for the Tigers Horn quick release Clark the rebound Yeah hes a guy that you cant really help off of so I need to stay at home on him All the way to the basket again for Gerard Hall Got it Second chance cheering over the shoulder into the basket and to the free throw line Well how about one Joe Gerard turning into a driver in this second half and this is a much better use of PJ Halls time here getting inside Its also the second personal foul on DJ Burns who strides to the Kevin Keats NC State bench Well and that accomplishes two things You get him out but it also you know probably less of a chance of picking up fouls guarding Middle Brooks Unable to complete the threepoint play for PJ Hall It was just the second free throw attempted in the game by the Tigers cheering And they are a very good free throw shooting team 78 and third cheering in the conference This is Horn around the edge Gerard tied him up Theyre going to assess the foul to Chase Hunter Thats his second That was really the first foul Maybe a a hand check on his hip but youre going to see that theyre going to spy on Horn Youre always going to have especially coming off the ball screens This the 166th all time meeting Miscommunication cheering Diara and Horn Yeah this horn kind of checked up on the cut and thought he was going to go all the way to the corner Just the third turnover of the game for NC State Shefflin open three He shoots a very high percentage from beyond the arc Mike Well and hes like I said Brad Brownell has really been encouraging cheering to take that shot Okonnell Shefflin Gerard Hunter from the corner cheering Money cheering Kevin wants to time out cheering Its a nine nothing Clemson run with the Tigers up by three after the three from Hunter into double digits with 10 points Chase Hunter on target for the Tigers Were Ram And when trucks are what you do you do truck month better than anyone else You do trucks that work harder and

3929 late in the first half a 152 run for the Tigers across halftime Its interesting now I mean its a good interesting matchup with Clark cheering They got a taller cover on Horn That is Horn his length Maybe theyre trying to get a guy on him to to bother his jump shot Remember the Tigers have won six in a row in the series They won all three meetings last year including the quarterfinals of the tournament Gerard created contact Hell go to the free throw line And in this half is interesting Gerard doing more work in the midrange game and in the paint than Ive seen him recently Okonnell

the game for Clemson He is one of three players in double digits Well the best you mean you got the under 16 media timeout coming out The best thing is didnt pick up that third foul cheering during this stretch So you know they were able to reclaim the lead So well see how long Brad Brownell can have him on the bench for cheering It is a 140 run and NC State has missed its last five shots cheering The other good news for Clemson is that DJ Horn has not scored in this half yet cheering Burns the turnaround with Pack in desperate need of that bucket from Burns and he obliges now with 12 points And I and I think you know given the choice theyll live with him scoring inside Beetle stop and start inside to Godfrey One power dribble over Burns cheering for two See if you take your time

Built to serve Back in Tiger Town on the CW 5143 Its the largest lead of the game for the Tigers Mike who are six of nine from the floor in the second half Yeah it has been a different half offensively for Clemson Very aggressive been attacking inside We talked about that at halftime Different focus for them Joe Gerard has been attacking the rim Good inside outside presence And for NC State its been a struggle offensively Tigers in the midst of that 162 run after trailing by four at halftime 3935 And the big thing too you can see Clemson really cheering locked in on DJ Horn defensively Casey Morcel at the free throw line Spent two years in the Virginia program Second year at NC State cheering Hes played a lot of basketball too Mike This is his 142nd career college basketball game Hunter Beetle and hell stay with the Tigers Clemson shooting 53 for the game Its going to be Morel on the foul for the Pack And because of Clemsons aggressiveness first half NC State didnt get anywhere near the bonus That was already their fourth team foul on 14 and 12 minutes into this to go in the in the second half Clemson 177 on the season 76 in conference play They are three and three against ACC opponents on their home floor Amazing how both teams the same conference record could be so far apart in you know where they are though Not all seven and six records are created equal Although Kevin Keats told us yeah we still have a chance to fight for the double buy Top four teams in the ACC regular season standings Tigers got one of those double buys last year Pittsburgh very much in the running with a win today Burns gave it off That was Taylor The cutter was able to get the shot away late in the shot clock and a foul against Clemson Its the third on Shefflin Third foul announced on Ian Shefflin That was a good cut and and the defense in the lane just got caught looking that time Everybody was looking at Burns rather than trying to pick up cutters Hes such a good passer out of the post Jaden Taylor is a 77 free throw shooter Shefflin leads Hall comes in Dont forget womens hoops tomorrow Georgia Tech number six NC State head coach West Moore against Nell Fortner and the Yellow Jackets in Raleigh Tonight were in Clemson South Carolina Tom Wormy Mike Jaminsky and our outstanding CW courtside Saturday production crew with you and Brad Brown out and Kevin Keats Its the only time theyll meet in the regular season Clemson now for five from the line NC State is 11 of 16 Hunter driving had it taken away cheering That was a terrific defensive run down by Taylor but stepped out of bounds came up the ball This is a great block but right youll see is right there Well he was substantially out of bounds A great defensive play Relatively easy call for our officiating crew Clemson maintains possession with 1344 on the game clock in the second half Gerard gathers and hits more Why are you going to go flying by that and give him an open look at a three Close out under control Get a hand up Youre taller than Gerard 13 points for Joe Gerard Had 18 the midweek win against Miami right here at Little John Coliseum for Joe Gerard to transfer cheering applause Shot clock five Barren State Burn spins on Hall They cheering collapse down on him Shot clock violation That was actually a triple team cheering RJ Godfrey came in late on the baseline You

transfer from Winthre Second year in the NC State program cheering Hes on the bench right now Only seven field goal attempts in the first seven and a half minutes for NC State GERARD TO GODFREY cheering GOING ON A rim bender for the Tigers cheering cheering Over three minutes now without a field goal for NC State Largest lead of the game for Clemson cheering Gerard trying to shut down the baseline on Taylor What a shot falling away Horn still without a point in the half And you can see the way theyre guarding him that his guy is not even looking at the play He theyre just basically faceguarding Horn wherever hes going Including tonight three of the next four games for the Tigers at home Clark on the move He stumbled and there was contact Gerard nifty little pass to RJ Godfrey

for more than 150 years Back at Little John Coliseum the eightpoint lead on the strength of 62 shooting in the second half for the Clemson Tigers Lets take a look at whats going on around the ACC Mike its presented by TMobile Like I said I mean to me the surprise late team has been Pit U theyre proving to be a very dangerous squad in the last eight games of the season Uh Georgia Tech has been very dangerous at home Um theres a lot of games you have to be very careful with going down the stretch Yeah Pit has now won five in a row and North Carolina Duke and Virginia now all have 20 wins for the season Talking about Georgia Tech they defeated Duke and North Carolina on their home floor at McCamish Pavilion Yeah those top their top three are pretty set I think for the double buy Its that fourth spot thats up the ground Gerard cheering rocking the three ball Connell slow to get up 16 points for Gerard when hes shooting with confidence Mike very difficult to stop cheering Even when hes not shooting with confidence still hard to stop Four made threes in the game to Joe Gerard Middle Brooks the cutter Acrobatic shot He got bumped in midair Godfrey was there defensively for the Tigers And thats his first personal foul So Middle Brooks at the free throw line for NC State You You know its interesting Tom that you you talk to coaches and and the fan base thinks that you get a guy like Gerard whos played all these games for Syracuse cheering and you immediately plug him in to Clemson hes going to fit in seamlessly And thats not the case That it takes time to fit into the culture the system the termin ology is different It takes guys time It appears though Mike at this stage of the season its a good fit Yeah No and its its working well And and but it doesnt happen automatically It doesnt happen in November and December 373 career made threes for Joe Gerard Third in conference history I think coach Brownell was trying to get a timeout to avoid the 5second call but it was granted So Timeout taken by Brad Brownell Most wins in school history Mike 258 for coach Brownell Here are the updated standings and we mentioned our teams in our game tonight both at seven and six Well and thats you know projecting out if you know Clemson with the win would keep close with Wake and Pit with eight wins And thats why that that win for the possible outcome the win for Wake would have been huge today to get close to Virginia plus you know the the quad one win on the road to get them up in into that fourth spot Tough loss for them on the road by two points And for Kevin Keats and NC State Mike this is the road ahead and there are some challenging games on that schedule Yeah three of that see they got three of four on the road after a couple of them at couple at home BC is BC is not a tough out um Florida State you know and then of course that uh that the game at North Carolina is the people at North Carolina North Carolina State understand that rivalry NC State won its first three road games in the ACC Theyve lost three in a row since three and three in conference on the road for the Pack Bele tough one Bit of a runner Middle Brooks the rebound Taylor with an alley trying to get it to Middlebrooks out of bounds and back to Clemson He would have been better off putting that one up on the rim That was a tough pass to connect Fifth turnover of the game for NC State Well and with States pressure defense I mean this game far from far from finished theyre going to be pressing for the last 10 11 minutes of the game And we as weve seen with Horn he hasnt scored yet in the half but he can explode Hunter misses midrange Okonnell on the run waiting for the reinforcements Gerard recovered defensively Middle Brooks for three cheering which is he was one of 12 on the year before that shot and Im sure one that Brad Barnell would welcome him shooting at this point in the game Five of 14 on cheering three for NC State Gerard takes it strong Just putting his head down against Okonnell cheering 18 points for Joe Gerard cheering I mean at some point Horns has got to try to take over the game Trying to drive it against Beetle Gerards got 12 and a half Mike you see four guys out for Clemson Nobody back in the lane area Everything cleared out for that drive You know Connells going to play him to try to drive him off the threepoint line So he took advantage of the open lane Gerards 18 points leading all scorers in our game Burns has 12 Horn has 11 But as Mike has mentioned Horn has not scored in the second half cheering Taylor shot clock is at 10 stepping back Thats for a three for Taylor Critical three for the Pack First one theyve made this half after four attempts Jaden Taylor into double digits with 10 His first three of the game at the other end A foul on the drive So that is the third personal on DJ Burns sending RJ Godfrey to the free throw line And you know really with Godfrey at 48 from the line not a bad decision to put him make him try to prove it at the line I mean it is its an expensive foul with three on Burns Pretty solid there Didnt look like a 48 Hunter exits the game for the Tigers Burns again with the third personal Hes got 12 points He is the leading scoreer right now for NC State One of two for God and the lead is 10 9 and 12 minutes to go in regulation as Horn walks it off cheering Horn fires away and knocks it down There was no doubt in his mind that shot was going up The thing to Clemson theyve had bigger guards on him the whole game They tried to They havent had Hunter on him or Gerard 14 points for Horn Gerard fouled in midair Morcel and thats his third correction Second on Morcel Hes going to be shooting three Once again the officials at the scorers table I think theyre going to look to see whether hes going to be shooting two or three free throws Brent Hampton and Clarence Armstrong are looking at it Yeah I mean thats it was clearly I was from over here I was clearly behind the arc So you know just a complete bailout foul could have again the second on Marcel and you laid out the numbers and once again you go by if you want to bother the shot fine but you dont put it a 90 free throw shooter at the line for three How about this across the nation Mike Joe Gerard third in the country Hes probably upset about being third I know if I were shooting 938 Id be upset about being third Three for three from the line Gerard one more to come Maybe two more to come actually He has such an intense pregame regiment Mike as far as shooting is concerned he will shoot for an hour prior to the game before anybody else comes on the floor He goes out with one manager and that cheering person feeds him at various spots on the floor and then he goes to the free throw Yeah And the result is you saw the free throws that didnt even hit the net three times cheering 21 points for Gerard the leading scoreer in our game Burns free throw line 14 for Burns See I and this is no disrespect intended at all but I I dont think DJ Burns beat you DJ Horn beat you Pick your DJ DJ play my jam Whos it going to be Into the back court off of Morcel And a back cheering court violation cheering Coach Keats going to the bench with Okonnell Taylors going to come out screaming Just two points in the game for Okonnell Actually Taylor remains in the lineup Morcel trops to the bench Six points for him 105 shooting Big second half for Joe Gerard Hand off Beetle corn on the weak side And I think you know definitely NC State will will live with him taking those threes Diara another three for Diara And a fist pump after the make Well I mean now hes in especially in this game hes proven he can make that shot Youve got to at least come out and be aware of him Theres almost an over and back He is three for three on threepoint attempts Hes five of five in the last two games Modiara Hall powers his way in cheering Fivepoint game inside of 7 and 12 minutes to go Okonnell looking to go back door and baseline to Taylor out of bounds Will stay at this end of the floor Modiara cant miss from deep Kevin Keats loving it Not so much for Brad Brownell in a fivepoint game My names Cody Archie and Im Erica and were

second half for the Tigers Chase Hunter gives him the 4441 lead Hes got 10 And Mike how about Joe Gerard 15 points in the second half Yeah big and I think you know they they have mixed it up a little bit but overall more of an emphasis on going inside for Clemson in this second half better job attacking the rim Four of six on threepointers for Joe Gerard NC State chip away though They have made their last four shot attempts and it is a fivepoint game cheering Burns Taylor the cutter Nifty pass from Burns He has really made them pay when theyve come in the double team Theyve waited till when he puts it on the floor but he still made a play It is a threepoint game 70 run over the last minute and a half for NC State Hall backing down in the paint cheering Basket and foul PJ Hall and that you know and thats what happens when you have shooters out on the floor and thats maybe what the addition of Gerard has added that NC State choosing to lets play man on man with Yara inside and on you know on a lot of occasions hes done the job but man PJ Hall multiple dribbles inside hes going to score and hes thats had a couple of and ones in there picked up the foul Confency State called to the free throw line NC State picked up a delay of game warning Thats what Ron Grover was motioning over to the scorers table Shlin off the miss Gerard wastes no time back iron trying to follow it Okonnell pops it ahead and then he gets tied up with Clark Second on Clark Emotions are running high on the court right now Mike BJ Hall normally a reliable free throw shooter has missed two opportunities for threepoint plays Fivepoint lead for the Tigers Horn difficult shot Clark is over the top for the rebound And out with Gerard Clarks given that third rebounder up front DJ Hall eyes for the rim He ran it to Diara And then the attempted save goes over the head of Hunter and out of bounds How about the defense by the pack I tell you what its Its Its been pretty consistent on both ends of the floor And that was actually a nice job keeping his keeping vertical on that Not coming down with his arms Sensational defensive play Diara hes done it at both ends of the floor cheering Remember Diara is three for three on threepoint attempts He had only made seven all season before tonight Okonnell shed the defender Thats Burns and Hall struggling for the rebound And the indication on Burns It is going to be Burns Mike And thats his fourth cheering Ninth Thats a Thats the last of the one ones A double bonus next for Clemson And then the next NC State foul Next Clemson foul of Wolfpack shooting one and one cheering And that one was a little shaky but it gives him a little bit of confidence that goes more importantly on the front end of the oneonone He makes it So first made free throw of the game for Hall Now 13 points Counterclockwise spin on losing all of the equipment on both of those free throws cheering Halls on the bench right now after the free throws 14 points for him Gerard leads

finish in Tiger Town Godfrey Series of moves Diara pulls it down cheering Dr the transfer from Missouris had a tremendous game and now Horn starting to heat up again Mike its a threepoint game Yeah And uh you know but better for Clemson to drive him off the threepoint line make him take longer twos but uh yeah I know hes see Im sure last time outs and take this game over Pull up Gerard does not get the bounce Diara another rebound cheering Seven boards for Diara to go along with 10 points Hes cheering put backto back games together for NC State Terrific game against weight the double double

Its a little more like it for TJ Hall Here comes DJ Burns Hes playing with four personal fouls Hes got 14 points Second leading scoreer behind Horn Middlebrooks to the bench for Kevin Keats Yeah that

confidence at the stripe continues to grow for Hall applause cheering he unties us with the free throw cheering applause 18 points now for Paul Brad Brownell trying to coach the crowd into the game cheering A Saturday night in Clemson South Carolina and a collision and a bump Hunter on Horn and Horn is at the free throw line ready willing and able I mean he ran over to that free throw strike

Yeah cheering what a steal by Clark driving Diara came back Mike pinned it That was good cheering Basket interference That was a great deflection A great steal by Clark on the one end And you can see clearly a a goalending call That is the first Clemson field goal in the last four minutes and 12 seconds And it gives the Tigers a twopoint lead over Kevin Keats and the Wolfpack trying to snap a threegame losing streak on the road in the ACC Their last road win Mike was at Louisville January 13th Their last overall win February 3rd at home against Georgia Tech It was win number 200 in Kevin Keats career And uh quietly Jack Clark has had a very nice game tonight Eight points seven rebounds for him And that nice steal and deflection in the open four Moments ago DJ Burns fouled out of the game for NC State Clark made the steal Diara got back defensively but was whistled for a goalending violation And here we are 7573 Each team Mike has had the lead in this game for approximately 17 half minutes Its been that close between the two schools So just getting some moisture off of the floor here at Little John Coliseum Tremendous crowd on a Saturday night to watch these rivals Everything has PS on it down here Even the roads The 166th all time meeting has gone right down to the wire cheering NC State has lost five in a row here in Clemson Taylor Shot clock at eight for Horn Shefflin defending Taylor pumps it up cheering Shefflin Diara held ball situation The arrow favors the Tigers on the tie up And on that possession they got the ball out of Horns hands twice So with exactly two minutes to go the officials are taking a look at it Brent Hampton and Clarence Armstrong are over at the scorers table Diara in red Shefflin in white and orange The players on the court Two seven and six teams in ACC play know what win number eight could mean for their fortunes moving forward to Washington DC and beyond trying to figure out the clock Yeah it looked like the shot clock reset or did Well does the shot by Taylor graze the rim or not Mike Yeah thats the key here Doesnt look I mean its tough to tell from that angle but it doesnt look like it Yeah its right It looks like from that sign it looks like its re its called the jump ball and I think its going to be Clemsons ball cheering So again there was the subsequent tie up and the arrow favoring the Tigers Yeah thats Ron Groover is coming over to talk to Gman to explain as Brad Barnell gets his explanation three Thats why were courtside so we can get the info Yeah the uh the shot clock was re It was an error reset So it was a jump ball and on the jump ball its Clemsons ball Okay cheering So the shot clock should not have been reset Tigers possession on the hell ball NC State deploying the fullourt pressure Hunter This is literally oneonone with Taylor Outside of two minutes to go Shot clock at 10 Hunters pass deflected to Horn Potential twoon one Taylor missed the layup Wow It looked like he lost some concentration Was trying to draw the contact instead of looking to finish Would have tied us at 75 Taylors had a nice game with 12 points He would like that one back Gerard spins and hits cheering He has just scored in so many different cheering ways in this second half 23 POINTS FOR JOE GERARD cheering and a timeout NC State trailing by four What a sequence Mike A layup miss at one end Gerard high degree of difficulty at the other for the bucket And as we take a look at our player of the game its brought to you by Progressive Insurance Mike Save when you bundle auto home or motorcycle insurance Visit progressivecom Its number 11 Joe Gerard Wow Hes been so efficient in cheering this game Seven of 13 shooting four of seven from three But whats impressed me is hes done midrange work Hes driven the ball gotten to the free throw line And remembering what we said at the outset what Brad Brownell told his team you guys are going to have to make plays And Joe Gerard was not just a threepoint shooter in this game He made plays and uh made big plays down the stretch Still a lot of time fourpoint play You got DJ Horn A lot of time left 17 points in the second half for Joe Gerard Theres your reset The arrow back to NC State trailing 7773 Again theyve lost five in a row on the road here in Clemson Again Im you know game planning and you know I know Drs made some threes Im putting a guy and a half on horn and Im making somebody else beat me cheering Tigers have won six in a row in the series seven of the last eight Furious comeback cheering by NC State here in the second half after leading by four Okonnell driving and scoring Big time take by Okonnell Hes favoring his right leg as he comes back up the court About 20 seconds difference between shot and game clock And that was his first basket of the game in traffic Gerard lost it cheering Fara made the defensive play and wow on Gerard The foul on Gerard his first How about Moi tonight Mike for NC State Yeah I know hes been hes been tough defensively One of two from the line of the game for Diara Only 64 of the season One and one One and one And now he can tie us 11 points now for Diara cheering Hes also got eight rebounds as well He has earned his keep tonight to tie us at 77 Modiara cheering couldnt do it Paul if thats a tie up it is And thats NC State ball So Hall came down with it and they tied him up MIKE it took a hot bounce off the rim And then just Warcel really made that play digging in on it Theyre going to take a look at it screaming I think theyre trying to figure out the clock once again Mike on the hell ball situation The arrow favoring NC State Officials back to the scorers table So right now the clock says 312 It doesnt appear to move It didnt Yeah it didnt didnt start on the miss Each team has one timeout remaining Got to determine how much time should be removed from the clock It did not start after Diara missed the second free throw That could have taught us at 77 and theyve got a clock over there that they can run in real time and and determine how much they should have taken off Just incredible turn of events in this game throughout the course of the game Clemson is led by as many as 12 here in the second half NC State had a 10point lead late in the first half Clemson hit a couple of late threepointers to cut into that lead It was four at halftime All right Theyre taking it down to 258 and theres going to be 20 seconds So 58 Clemsons going to have at least 58 coming back NC State will have 20 seconds to work with What a finish Both teams still sitting with one time out each and any foul that Clemson gives will still be the one and one situation that NC State will not be in the double bonus yet We saved the best for last on CW court side Saturday to wrap up the ACC schedule Were going down to the final seconds at C State and Clemson cheering Pack on the inbounds Middlebrooks falls all over him Onepoint game cheering Shot clock to 10 for Horn Kevin Keith didnt like the way that was developing He burns his last time out 10 seconds left Tigers still have a timeout left And the possession arrow favors the Clemson Tigers Its gone back and forth in the last couple of minutes with a couple of hell ball situations 7776 Incredible DJ Horn leads everybody tonight Mike with 25 points on nine of 19 shooting and five made threes And he could be a very good option for NC State late in this one And this is you know Im Im one for really screaming attacking the rim in this situation Put in the pressure make the referees make a call cheering Itd be a real luxury to have DJ Burns out on the floor in this situation Burns is fouled out of the game 14 points for Burns on the sideline for Kevin Gates But again you know maybe lets see how what what to what extent that Clemson goes to try to keep to face guard DJ Horn to try to keep the ball out of his hands This is also its its pressure on the inbounder You got to keep your poise keep that 5second count in in your head You dont have that you dont have a timeout How about the scoring from DJ Horn over his last five Amazing I told you his last four Mike he was averaging almost 27 points per game and shooting over 50 And the inbounder is Ben Middlebrook So you got size He can see over and theyre going to theyre not going to theyre not going to guard the inbounder They got five guys out NC State has a one here in Clemson South Carolina since March of 2015 Theyve got five on the shot clock for a horn A runner He hits it AND HE PUTS THE PACK IN FRONT 7877 Coming up THE COURT IS HUNTER trying to BEAT THE CLOCK HE DRIVES IT BOUNCES OUT OKONNELL HAS IT FLINGS IT AHEAD FOR NC STATE AND THE W BACK WINS 78
