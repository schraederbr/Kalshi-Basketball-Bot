Music not too often wearing their blacks on their home floor lets play some basketball on a Wednesday night in Winston Salem North Carolina and Kaia Harrison the fifthy year senior will be the point guard at the outset tonight Alex Scruggs looking back door for Harrison its deflected and taken by dorsy ant does a really good job in man pressure plan in passing Lanes you cant turn the basketball over W did a nice job getting back in transition fires up an air ball shes 64 but she can shoot she made one of her two threes previously before that Miss yeah Shia Clark youre talking about youre going to like for her size its going to be a good match up with C shes got really good hands hell use her on offense in the high post a lot Elise Williams misses her first shot tonight the rebound finds dorsy the Junior from Augusta Georgia dorsy off the back bracket and the onehanded rebound pulled down by Scruggs SCS playing some solid ball ahead of the pack Mala Kohls gets the first bucket of the night and I think if Wake Forest can get rebounds and run thats certainly going to help their offense theyre not looking to be in a fast tempo Wake Forest would like to keep this game in the low to mid 60s George K would like to be in the 70s chance for a threepoint Play Shania Clark call her baby Shack and shes going to be a load to handle inside we just talked about her great hands a long high low pass con is a good shooter this time throws it up got contact and able to finish Shenia Clark gave the foul to Elise Williams her first and Clark Richard sophomore from Fort Meyers completes a threepoint play after the made free throw you see some of that gold cor pressure one two one1 from time to time this time just a token pressure man Deo picked up by brone Williams matched up with Tucker as the ball finds the cutting dble inside and shell get to the free throw line nearly 90 seconds gone in this first quarter and the fouls going on Malia brone ktie dble its already played more minutes this year stand that she played all last year and the red shirt freshman from Brisbane Australia is going to be an important player for Megan jabia who starts her second season at the Helm of the decks big game tonight for Megan shes 18 and 18 as coach of the decks one for two at the line for dble only 40 minutes play a season too for dble so its been a very pleasant surprise in these first two and awarded basketball games for L Forest nice passing Davis keeps it moving and the right wing jumper wouldnt go for Tucker Harrison might be the quickest player on the floor and shes called for the charge Tucker able to set the feet as Kai Harrison picks up her first watch Harrison wait does a nice job in pushing the ball good to see her in the start she may be the fastest player on the court but a good defensive play that time by ENT I thought her feet were in the restricted area there Applause Stan if Im not mistaken that was one of the rules changes from women to men year was taking away the restricted area fig from under the basket its going to be a block times out of 10 for con rounding out Williams pulls down the rebound quick Outlet Deo trying to get some easy baskets would be very important for Wake Forest once again ENT does a nice job getting back in transition defense Dy Gordon Music Williams deil takes it m Forest 0 for two from Beyond The Music Arc dorsy creates a little contact and draws the foul on Malaya Kohls on the Baseline Kohls plagued by foul trouble over the weekend Davidson had 19 points against wford but no points in just 10 minutes played with four fouls against the Wildcat and that goes back to what we were seeing in the open we just dont know what youre going to get out of some people especially you look at COs and you look at Dil players that didnt play or didnt have much time a season ago due to injury now asked to play more condition will be excellent drive but Tucker couldnt finish and the loose ball finds Scruggs shes almost tackled in the back court by by Davis Harrison on the drive and free throws coming for KA we see the ability of Ka Harrison the senior plus one to able to drive and penetrate the Aggie defense and get contact dont want to be that person but shes had a lot of success all Im going to say free throw line this year fou was on Shaniah Clark Lo Nia Willis Paris lock the first Subs into the game for Terell Robinson alltime winning as coached in AT program history in womens Hoops its going to be interest an interesting season for Kai Harrison stand shes got a lot of experience shes got a lot of speed cant she be a court general and and Lead this team and score yeah I think she can be a court general I question about that the thing that you ask is can she be a consistent score maybe a double digit score she hasnt had to be that score but shes got to be that second or mus maybe third option the way I see it offensively right now she can get a lot of those points just like shes doing there pressing the basketball pushing it and making free Music throws going glass in transition and the loose ball tie up Arrow will keep it with the Aggies Fus Soko Stevens TSA green and Cory Chambers presiding over the game tonight theres Terell Robinson over 200 wins at the Helm of the Aggies of course on Alum as well played Four Seasons ATT hes a good ball player scored 934 points in his college career and thats going to be a foul on Williams and thats her second in the opening three and a half minutes make a noted that 629 and Elise Williams the Deacons leading score so far this season with her second foul will they keep her in I think youve got to get her out early dont want to pick up a cheapy Williams to the bench at 629 as you said Melissa Andrews who started played 32 and a half minutes per game in the first couple games first off the bench for jebbia along Madison Jordan who checked in as well Jordan freshman from Morrisville Panther Creek High School one of two and a rebound for Music Applause Harrison Williams not on the floor who becomes the goto two playmaker on the offense eels got to be a score Harrisons got to be the facilitator Eble got a good look get it out Andrews on the glass traveled and this would not be a bad night for Alyssa Andrews to step up in his scoring column as well you keep remembering last year a couple games remember we had the NIT game against Morgan she was able to knock down a lot of shots on the Baseline she may not get that those good looks outside because an is going to play a lot more man than Morgan did but shes got the potential to be a big scorer it was great pressure defense until Alex Scruggs reached in on Kiana Curtis and and Evan Alex krooks is another one of those veteran players a fifth year play of the grad that that also has to step her game up in schore and she has the ability to score without running plays just just she gets rebounds Second Chance opportunities was in the passing Lane there and all of these factors have to go in for this week forest team I think to not only win tonight but be successful throughout the season one player cant carry this basketball team not that tonights an easy game by any means this AT team is going to give Wake Forest a handful for 40 minutes but the schedule really crescendos quickly with BYU and St Louis in Hawaii and then home games against OVA and Texas AM the trip to James Madison after that is not going to be easy with everything the Dukes athletic department is doing these days Keana Cur is 32 in for the a hes long athletic can defend the wing lot of free throws so far in this game six of the 10 points have come from the line Conley in the ball game a nice perimeter shoot it doesnt shoot a lot its got a really nice touch Andrews kicks it out dble with a clock winding down Harrison let get it Applause Music Applause off yeah but thats exactly what we were talking about a moment ago youve got to be a willing score youve got to move without the basketball you cant let ents defensively set back and guard you they were fourth best in the ca last year only given about 56 points a ball game a halfcourt Slowdown half court midtempo I think favors entt Midway through this first quarter and the team still chilly from Beyond The Arc but an offensive rebound for dorsy and going Baseline on the glass its Curtis and she has it taken away cleanly by Jordan excited to see Wake Forest freshman see what they can do Madison Jordan one of them Quinn B turoff the others highly rated class and theyre going to get some opportunities early youd think dorsy the steel nice pass and t takes the lead courtesy of demaya Tucker loose pass dorsy got in the passing Lane took it down could have easily laid it up but made the nice pass AG he take the lead again youve got to youve got to understand your pressure theyre very athletic long arms on defensive side you got to be smart with your pass Conley cant connect Outlet pass for Tucker and her entry feed deflected and stolen here comes Harrison one on Three Dil runs with her to the corner Ka bucket nice nice pass for in transition Dil had a shot put it on the floor got a Defender there made the extra pass Harrison Ready to knocked down the shot thats a good sign for Wake Forest second three of the year for Kai Harrison talking about Harrison only made eight last year any three she can knock down add to that scoring value heres a steal from Andrews Alysa all alone lays it in Alyssa Andrew the Jun getting her opportunity now to play more consistent minutes and the passing Lane able to finish and weve seen that athleticism in the past 6 tall long capable of guarding and finishing one of the top scorers in high school in Northern Virginia when she came out and nows going to have those quality minutes dorsy hasnt scored yet feeds inside lock for two nice Paris lock another one of those young Aggy freshman talk about her and say hey she can play one of four positions and do them fairly well so they like her versatility there we go Andrews knocks down the three but weve seen in the past when shes got the confidence she can knock down that long perimeter shot and again shes got to be confident enough to take the shot and then knock it down when the opportunity comes stagger here see if they drive or cut well crosscourt on the drive rebound tipped controlled by AT fresh 20 to work with two minutes to go in this opening quarter clock at five dorsy no rebound last Touch by wake shot did not hit the rim AT will have 3 seconds in the shot clock but first well get ourselves a timeout K Harrison her fifth year with the program knocking down the corner three to give wake the lead early fourpoint lead for Wake Forest as you see the deaks upcoming schedule the next two games Saturday and Monday will be played just a few time zones away in Hawaii but Megan Jeb throwing her team into the deep end early in the season all the challenging opponents what a good thing I mean you you got said you got to find out who can play and how were going to play turns it over yeah they fourth but uh its a nice trip and you go out there you got to try to get some Ws play with some confidence and and again some of these young players that havent had the experience in time on the court theyre going to get it got to produce Riley turoff the ninth different demon Deacon to take the floor in the games first nine minutes tonight took off the Freshman from Jersey was a prolific score in high school excited to see her play we did not see her in last weeks win last Monday against wford but uh can score the basketball a lot of ways over 2000 points in her High School career scrubs good look in and out rebound for Malia Bron Ks been very quiet so far in this basketball game 0 of one average 13 game last year and hell stay with the Aggies this AT team and we talk about Megan jabia in her second season building the foundation Terell Robinsons in year number 12 but the agies are in year number two in the CAA and they were picked really low at the CAA media day start of their first season then they win eight of their first nine conference ball games and show that they can compete at that level they finished 12 and six in the leag last year they could always compete did nobody you didnt know what they had because theyd come from the Big South but they were Terrell Robinsons won over 15 ball games the last four years they theyve gone to the NCAA theyve played in wnit this is a quality basketball program over in Greens its a blocking foul and Deo will get to the free throw line again drive to basketball when the opportunity arise comes up just a step too late this nice call there but if youre entt youre looking at the situation we just got the just before the break only three of 13 shooting they theyve got shots they not knocking them down wake for us four of eight so far but also doing a nice job on the glass Riley turov scored Four Points in 10 minutes at Davidson almost 2500 in her High School career in Jersey she also won a state championship in volleyball and did the high jump the triple jump and through the Music discus its an offensive foul on Davis see take a look right now watch Davis come there bump right there and then she throw thats an easy call there too somehow she ended up on the floor is the only one she like the fouls on me but yeah it was the initial contact about an 89 second difference between the game and shot clock here for Wake Forest Horns action double double High try to reverse it see if you can get a shoo you got Andrews on the wing turkov recovers T to shoot wait quietly on a 102 run recognize a clock Andrews does long rebound to Clark six seconds for Bron we need time Bron in and out at the Music Applause buzzer everybodys excited over there bro clock winding down Riley turoff cant connect as the shot clock sounds Lake Forest only four of 10 to end the quarter shooting Aggies are three of 16 so theyve had opportunities not able to knock those down Wake Forest doing a nice job perimeter defense offensive foul no guy travel its not too dissimilar to what we saw in the Wake Davidson game over the weekend where wake actually finished the game with a higher shooting percentage in the wild cats but the disparity in turnovers gave Davidson that many more chances and that was the difference Forest basketball team that that this year right now today today they cant turn the ball over they cant give up run but theyve got to do a decent job on rebound its going to be an offensive foul just cant have wasted Music possessions offensive foul called on turkov but I like the aggressiveness I do but it goes back to what I was just saying that you cant you cant turn You got an opportunity to score the basketball I think youve got to score only got four points in transition basket so four to two but now there you go bad pass but a good deflection a hes able to SC off maying near steal from Andrews in a 3se second call so the teams trading turnovers here the first 70 seconds of the quarter yeah neither team really running their half court very sharp right now and entt definitely not as sharp as they were against uh uh Georgia in the first half of that ball game where they eventually took the lead by eight at halftime neither team really Applause moving Harrison Scruggs Kohls Andrews and turoff out there right now for Wake Forest turoff on the catch to Harrison at the elbow little pouette and a 3se second call on Harrison you know I I love this offensive adjustment and you see some teams do most teams arent really going to try it but to take a guard someones accustom to handling the basketball and trying to cut them and use them in the middle of the Zone thats where youre seeing Harrison get the ball shes got to be comfortable and confident enough to be able to take that jump shot but she can also make great ball decisions so thats just a different look at how to attack a matchup or in some cases a full straight straight two two guard front Zone but lets see if theyll put Kay back in there and what decision shell make the fifth straight possession to end in a turnover for the two teams combined she can get the ball in the middle 11 she can score theres your stagger again how do you guard it Music pretty good hedge by Bron in the switch Harrison hanging in the air brought him from the other side so it looks like Harrisons going to be your number one offensive Outlet which isnt a bad thing Tucker nice move we talked so much about dorsy and even brone whos a preseason allconference performer but if you listen to the coaching staff they really are excited about bu a Tucker athletic long can run the floor Andrews knocks down her second three of the night a excellent Wing Music shooter do you think Megan jebie is hoping to keep Elise Williams on the bench till half and by that I mean wake keeps a cushion theres no reason like it is right now I I Im okay with that she picked up her second foul with 629 to go in the first Im okay with that has not been in the game since Nice Shot Shia Clark shes got a nice touch yeah and and they were asking who could be that inside presence that would replace Jasmine Harris from a season ago for ENT they like a lot of the things that Clark has given them how do you attack this to front looking for Harrison in the high post loose ball bods tumble Arrow belongs to AT now one of the problems if youve got K running the middle of this zone is what you saw the the length and the size of other players because Kai is not as tall but she compensates for that with her speed with her quickness and with her decision if she gets the ball you just got to do a better job making in passes Jordan back in for Wake Forest Curtis returns for the agies and you know Evan to go further into what you just asked about Williams as long as wait for us has got the lead they comfortable I I dont have a problem keeping her on the cuz you dont wanted to pick up that cheap throw to carry that into the second Music Applause half tough shot wont go Harrison leads the break Andrews on the glass lost it locked the other way Harris lock freshman from Baltimore as she was high school teammates with Wake Forest Matt Quimby last year mdis school in the Charm Music Applause City Tucker walled off rebounded by Andrews eight points three rebounds for Andrew so far tonight scrubs inside sees the double gets some help pretty good defense guarding the bucket Inside by Curtis get the ball in the paint finish the play left wing three wont go for Tucker but an offensive rebound and then the ensuing turnover from Curtis excuse me it was Music lock Harrison Nifty dribble creates contact the decisions by Harrison the quickness by Harrison shes going to be tough to defend like the little crossover that time under control having remembered that she had an offensive foul called earlier as able to pull up and take that little midrange Music jumper Stan do you well William going to come in so Williams sits about 11 minutes and 20 seconds of game time since picking up her second but she will get some more minutes here in this first half so if I if Im on the Williams side of thing youre glad to get back out there play smarter dont think about the second and the third and the fourth and the fifth foul just play basketball dont be cautious you end up picking up a foul if Im Terell Robinson in t I find Williams and I try to run something against her immediately trying to see if she can get a cheap third foul shes going to be in a defensive mode defensive mean not trying to pick up the foul least kind of shaking her head as she walks back onto the floor shes averaging over 15 points per game to start this young season just Tucker with the ball Tucker good off the bounce long Music athletic Willis some contact no whistle and Nia Willis lays it in he like Willis is a transfer a couple years ago from presbyterian along with Barone and and really has given entt some solid minutes on the cour her leadership her experience Williams looking for her offense Tucker with a rebound Zaya Tucker sets up brone for three transition is her game shes a excellent catch and shoot player knocked down 69 threes last year on her way to being a member of the second team CA she can play last five points for the agies from those former PA of blue hooses that you mentioned four minutes to go in this first half Williams Feed scrubs on the Block strong move to the bucket Alex scrs using the left hand being powerful and being patient in in the post first points for the night for Music Applause Scruggs out scoring force in the paint 10 to Applause six Curtis sets the screen Tucker gives it up Paris locked with four takes it makes it Music Paris loock got a really good basketball pedigree both her parents played basketball their dad coached at copen State back in the day with Coach Brown Derek Brown when Fang was there and so she understands the game as you mentioned from Baltimore area and really understand Terell Robinson was so happy to have her said man Ive known those guys at C forever to let my let their daughter play for me she is an honor I think shes going to be a solid player in her career des Running Out of Time Anderson gets her Miss back and well get to the Applause line well a andt had been 0 for five from three until Malia brone found this one in Rhythm t has cut a sevenpoint deficit down to two shes got eight points and four boards coming off the bench tonight stand I like her versatility shes just got to get more experience and then play with the confidence she had as a scorer back in her days in high school she can run the floor shes got length youve already seen her get in the passing Lane follow up a shot that time shes going to go to the free throw line but Alyssa Andrews could have that breakout season if she just continues to work find some confidence and get the ball to fall obviously in the hole youre weighing te you you got to say wow were still this this basketball game eight of 24 shooting but theyve done a great job the last few minutes on the glass out rebounding Wake Forest Wake Forest has got to continue to pound it try to score winning opportunity now only six of 18 shooting for the decks but theyre taking care of the basketball a little bit Andrews got her hands on it shes called for the kick ball its going out of bounds off her anyway clock stays is not under 20 stays at 24 clock will stay with the 10 count starts a new its an NBA possession right here 24 seconds the to we go theres your trap travel you like the full core pressure yeah its a great change of pace I think youve got to find a way to get some easy baskets a a good job of recognizing after the Dead B they kind of stood around you could see him creeping and and what you do you get him on the sideline and you dont let him out nice job by the Music deeps Ala COs nice move playing with a lot of confidence after missing the entire season last week she looked so smooth and Poss I know very disappointed getting in foul trouble that was a big time move inside there she gives wake a dimension on the Block that they need especially with deir Hines still out wake hoping to get her back sometime in December ball finds Clark again and well stay with AT and Evan watchs this post move nice little high low bounce pass goes low watch his drop step then the Up and Under little male move goes in there and thats a nice basket she can make a living just doing that she got great inside position thats where it started and everything else is graving took her time used her moves L her bag of tricks get some basket these cars is more of a dunan move I dont know if she knows M you think Mala knows M Harrison just picked up her second foul now she may not but you know again part of being a basketball player solid player which you got to know the history of game yeah got to know something happen before you after doing in the future thats all Im saying Al I didnt know George mik but I knew the Mike Tucker BS it in she is a matchup problem R te because of being it 6 feet tall maybe 61 hes got the lint she can post up she can take you off the wing nice kiss off the glass Harrison comes up short Andrew is unable to track it before it crosses the line you we talking a moment ago about that move but also about kys and Co shes got to really be I think that star inside in the half court transition game maybe not so much when we get in the half court shes got to be a star Jordan dorsy finally finds her offense 19 games some doubles on season to go just scores on runs maybe this could be the Run beginning for her big basket fourth tie of the game under a minute to play in the Music half Katie dble only one point and a half no field goals really quiet he looking for Andrews if you can get Andrews on the win deil lost it AT ball turnover number nine for the Demon Deacons wake never able to get in NE kind of Rhythm on their offensive set that time people drives inside got to understand that their hands are going to be there bounc it off the off her leg turkov in for Harrison Ka playing with two fouls Williams on the bench also with two fouls you saw what I was looking at I was going to say where was William did not want her to pick up a cheap one under 40 seconds Debbie is on top of it with her staff yes okay we are too Willis loose ball tur offs got it shes drilled in the back court its only the third team foul on AT so wake will have the final possession of the half year if they want it first foul on Music dorsy this is one one of those possessions you know last year juel spear is getting the ball in a possession like this now its okay well they got a couple freshman who can shoot possession too so this is this is really important score get the ball back score again trying to extend the lead start your offense thr a handshake you want to try to start your offense about seven six seven seconds that that may seem insignificant Stan but thats the second foul that dors picked up in the last minute now shes got two for the game yeah I dont I dont think Robinson wanted her to pick to pick that foul up not mad that they stopped the offensive floow but you dont want her to have the second here we go 7 seconds for dble the Aussie freshman makes a move on the dribble Running Out of Time scrubs at the buzzer turned out to get a half decent look that was well defended by entt the screen in guarded by dorsy Harrison picked up by Davis Williams free throw Jumper rebounded by Tucker dorsy one of four shooting the basketball in the first half lets see if they find some things to run for her to get her more involved dorsy rebounded by Music Scruggs Megan jeban not pleased with that decision 10th turnover of the day for w Music Applause Forest rone little Music hesitation finding the open player dorsy and her scoop shot is well short but bone there for the stick back and a and T takes its first lead since the score was 7 to five was pretty but he counted 2725 now 18 back in his so KS sees the defense dribbles around it meets it again kicks it for Music Dil Davis pulls down the miss a missed opportunity for Wake Forest versus Zone you got the ball in the pain for kls entry feed beautifully done Shenia Clark now has seven nice high low pass David a very smart player we talked about Clark at the beginning of the game great hands for young player in the post caught Music Applause finished this is the largest lead of the night for Music Applause Music AT dble to the short Corner scrubs everyones playing Hot Potato someones going to have to pull the trigger L for has passed up some good looks on that possession stand and ends up with a prayer at the buzzer and you know the thing about it if youre if youre wake you got to be disappointed atis hands werent up they were just moving bodies if they have been bigger it been even tougher than that Jordan dorsy gets the friendly bounce look like me on the golf course with a little wedge about 80 yards away little spun it backwards and went right in time out Demon Deacons seven straight for the Aggies out of the break finish and then in transition once again just kind of pushed the ball down secondary break weve been wondering where she was going to be shes there with a little Back Spin thats Jordan dorsy Aggies on the 70 run and wake turns it over just seconds out of the time out ats made its last three shots including that three from dorsy that dead ended off the back bracket then splashed on through you have to come out with a focus youve been hit in the mouth now you WG Force how do you respond you take a timeout you turn the ball over ant make them pay for this quickness off the dribble dorsy gets it back loses it dorsy just wanted it more underneath creates another possession the a score off this Recon to Davis pretty good defense Inside by Kohls see if W can get a look at the basket here looks like theyre in man scrubs open Music Applause look Tucker finds bone trailing Banks it in secondary break remember we talked earlier about getting back on defense stopping the transition baskets heres your trap nail for Music entt Balls got to move Evan Balls got to move and people got to move a lot quicker Andrews was the Deep spark in the first half and shes blocked on her second effort then Kohls ties up Curtis in side itll be AT ball via the arrow S I think its fair to say that the aies have upu their defensive intensity here in the second half yeah but but wake has helped them they have theyve helped him because of you know some easy missed opportunities some lazy passes and just coming out now with a little more focused that was a good rotation Andrew just not able to convert on the play and this is what an loves to do bring the big to the high post send Cutters off there look for the weak side shoo dorsy comes up short Williams fouled by dorsy in the back court thats number three on the engine of the agies Jordan dorsy think about Jordan she always had someone to practice with growing up cuz she was a twin her brother Josh was a pretty good ball player too very good family athletically down in Augusta Georgia shes the big sister 0 minutes minutes not yet 90 minutes thats walk whats going on with wakes offense right Music now its an attitude right now this this is about this is about somebody getting ticked off and said lets go and and um you know dont be mad after the game you didnt bring try to bring your A game this is just mental absis Andrew almost came up with a steal and a 3se second call on Clark she looked out at her feet and almost kind of nodded yeah had a heel is it me or or do they need a little more wind than the whistle and the little PE they still use ps dont you a loud whistle was that me did you hear it its its a reasonable thought so you do cant find saying this new broadc position gives me gives me new sense of Music hearing Kohls looking for daylight finds some Andrews three excellent job moov the defense found the wing shooter she does that very well got to be confident knocked it down great recognition by Co L Andrews first in the game in double figures shes got 12 if youre wake you got to find a way to get a Music stop Willis too strong Clark cant hit the follow and they get Clark with the over theb foul on the rebound yeah Clark kind of rushed that second chance and then pitch Williams into the Caper in the back of the head second foul on Clark and well get a timeout with 438 to play in the third Andrews three moments ago snaps the 90 run we got a sixpoint Music game Wes being out rebounded by 11 got 13 Music turnovers took my breath away I couldnt say it quick Coles tra get the ball in the paint you always hear coaches talk about paint touches paint touches paint touches got to be ready when you get that LE had put the ball right there Point Blank go up strong and score and he just move it look at the the spacing youve seen on the floor right now you got to feel good about what theyre doing officially theyll get a basket out of this theres a UIL a cut Willis Tipp by Andrews but its found inside by AT lock unable to finish at The Rim two good Applause Music looks leas Williams to the corner Andrews comes up short this time thats about three maybe four possessions at wake is had where its been one shot rone fouled by Music Scruggs and the thing of it is though Evan to be very honest with you the looks arent bad shots just arent really falling I mean you know and 30 from the field 27 from three yeah there you go plus youre being out rebounded this is a team in in Wake Forest get out rebounded their opponents 18 different times last year when they did it they were 12 and six so rebounding has always been something thats been very important for for Wake as long as I can remember getting Second Chance opportunities tonight theyre not able to take advantage of that the hes beat some good teams in that 2022 23 season before 4 teams that went to the NCAA tournament Louisville Miami Florida State and East Carolina great win over Louisville last year here wins over teams that made the wnit like Clemson Morgan State High Point URI clock winding down struggling Williams good Lu ATI started out with some two21 that slowed wake down wake never able to get in the offense ball never swings from one side to the other brone fouled again yeah we talk number three on scrug we talk about dorseys ability to score the basketball brone put up four games last year with 20 points better including 29 against Hampton 21 against UNCC Wilmington and the thing that they talk about is her ability to get rid of the ball quickly the quick shoot and release but she can put it on the floor very strong player again ant not really fluid so much offensively but theyre taking advant right now Wake Forest struggling on the offensive end and not making it pay on the defensive end which stops all CAA last year Malia brone she the alltime leading scorer at TL Hannah womens basketball history and the Aggies have stretched the lead to 10 thanks to some free throws by brone shes now got 11 points in the game ly felt like in their game against Georgia that they they really had a great opportunity to win that basketball game the score was a little deceiving and leading in halftime and just could not score in the third quarter and then fatigue set in just a little bit and and then you got you were down so much you couldnt come back but they felt very confident about going in this game that they could play put together for four quarters and you can win this ball game and and so far a bad start for ENT but the second half the last three or four minutes of the second quarter and now all of the third quarter have been you know blue and gold theyve seemingly learned from their mistakes in the third quarter against Georgia theyve been phenomenal so far in the third quarter tonight well this is a well coached team its a veteran team we talk about Tucker and dorsy you know brone Clark the soft the red shirt sophomore and Davis but uh you know Nia Willis comes in gives him something and Paris lock is freshman Phenom so this is a solid team as I said earlier youre going to hear a lot I think out of ENT as the year goes on we got an interesting schedule theyve got Liberty then they go out got West go out to St Marys for a tournament yep theyve got Louisville on their schedule in early December so hey here we go little trap again slows Wake Forest down takes them out of their Rhythm you got to be aggressive now Elise Williams its so for four two rebounds two assists but she still has not scored yet tonight see how big that zone is right now they theyre making theyre guarding the line Madison Jordan got a decent look would not fall out of the timeout after the Miss from wig Forest is just a freight train down the floor Paris lock all the way to the rim unimpeded until she was fouled at the bucket the tempo of this game is totally ENT theyre daring you to shoot from the outside theyre not going to give you anything 15 ft in and then if you miss theyre getting the rebound and theyre pushing the ball down the floor Wake Forest came in this ball game Sho only 26 from the three Applause line entt now seven of 10 from the free throw line wakes eight for Music 10 missed them both Jordan who was called for her first foul picks up her second rebound not to be obvious Joe here but wake needs a basket thought your name I thought your name was Stan yeah yeah they need obvious they need they need a basket and they need some enthusiasm right now tell me the plan Dan jump shot Music there one shot rebound goes the other way yeah transition pushes make him stop you this pass by Willis unable to finish inside though is lock coach Robinson look at the tape and after this ball game win or lose and say my goodness do we get a lot of point blank shots dble to Applause Kohls great recognition there in transition to push it down and then Cole just rolls to the basket I wanted to say that with would love to get Kohls going but the truth is they love to get anyone going other than Andrews boy yeah if we missed each other we starting to think like each other the same thats exactly right some anybody I just need a basket wakes only field goal of the quarter was the Andrews three that made it 3428 with 504 to play but ant will give up one point for that possession there we go points yeah there we go minute 46 left in the quarter not scoring the ball on offense You got to get baskets on the defensive side if youre ENT you just being Applause impatient Davis flips it inside for Clark comes up short wow didnt see that its a late whistle wind in the whistle told you that I Id like to see if theres contact I think she got her on the wrist but from this Fantage Point didnt really look like I thought that uh Clark may have just come up a little short on that nevertheless hell get a chance I dont think the foul was on the shooter so was okay good all right that that that that would make sense to me cuz I thought Clarks shot was short so t inbounds under the bucket and its stolen away Andrews the theft nice transition defense by entt dble Jordan missed it Scruggs back outside Williams and Dil open look for three yeah was hard it was hard to get a basket but that was a great look by dble on the weak side now lets see if they can put backto back baskets together snap the scoring drought of nearly four minutes under a minute to play here in the third and if youre AT you just move the ball from side to side and get what you want demaya Tucker is now four of eight shes got eight Applause Music points the zone is sty wake can someone Bust It Jordan missed rebound finds Williams no reset Elise Williams loose ball and they got scruggs fourth foul thats going to be two free throws for AT at the other end Im not sure that ball did bounce off Daviss toe for someone in there as Williams you know was driving in and probably if it been me I probably would have shot that was in the pain she needs to get going but being very unselfish past it and it this didnt work out and and this is the thing that you concern yourself with with a young basketball team youre struggling youre not making clean plays and then you begin to kind of drop your drop your head the body language kind of changes and now you you got to find that fire like I Applause said been a very quiet environment today so youve got to find a spar bone sinks a pair shes the games highest scorer now with 13 some full court pressure from ent1 again its just its not really theyre not trying to steal the ball theyre just trying to be a nuisance Williams has taken away by Bron and she throws it away Dil picks it up four seconds ahead Jordan to beat the buzzer got it Madison Jordan with potentially a game changing least Williams is yet to score over four shooting entt back in the zone turoff to bust it yes nice little look right there after the quarter break turoff knocks the three down little 60 run for Wake Forest here we go without AT touching the ball but beater at the end of the third first possession of the fourth Cuts an 11point game down to five makes it interesting thats going to be a Madison yep Jordan ran over Talia Davis get away with that in high school run over state champion last year at Panther Creek in dorsy straight away way three way off loose ball foul on AT number three on Clark dorsy not known as a big time threepoint shooter made 11 a year ago primarily scores in the mid midrange area number three on Clark if Im not mistaken know a year ago Stan wake was third in the AC in three pointers made per game with almost seven a game theyve got seven made threes tonight Ws only made four twopoint field goals through three quarters thats astonishing thats why you got 37 Music points wake is four of 13 from two which which does say something about the zone defense from t theyre not really letting wake get the ball inside off also too theyre not but Wes getting shot so six of 21 six of 20 7 of 23 actually shooting from the three line a lot of pressure right now I think on theyve got to score the basketball to kind of negate this run and W on give themselves some more breathing distance I like the ball movement beautiful pass dorsy to Davis get the ball up top reflexs cut on the Baseline gets you a wide open layup thats more Daviss game first bucket of the night for the junior out of the Rivers School in Music Massachusetts team back man now Harrison no t going the other way KES on Conley watch the ball movement here great look there theres a cut a little Baseline screen and just beat the defender on the cut connley didnt close off the Baseline gives Davis the opportunity to get the easy layup J clar on the for the Clark was not out for long shes back in after the short breather playing with three fouls and lets see if entt on this next possession with Clark back in the game will they go back to the Zone would man that Poss Harrison had the opportunity to make the layup wasnt wasnt able to do so Harrisons going to put some pressure on the ball dorsy all the way Banks it in offensive foul wave off the two thats the team defense you ask theres the pressure got by stepped in there the Freshman whos made a big jumper a minute ago that time St stepped in and took the charge all the little things that as they says coaches will tell you and people say its an accumulative game and you look at the jump shot that Madison GE made thats a three you get a three off that then she takes the offensive foul takes away a possible threepoint play the other way thats a massive call yeah a a fringey call and dorsy gets her fourth and has to sit down as a result of it you make a note of that at the 808 Mar Harrison dribbles out of trouble Williams blocking Applause foul two free throws coming for Applause Music Alise Drive Williams there Defender wasnt set body was there but feet werent down she wasnt in legal guarding position gets here about a step quicker thats going to be a good call you mean a good charge for a good a good call yeah as far as taking the offense front yeah you know what I mean You been away from me that long you know you starting to think interpretations Im just ask asking for a I feel like its my job to translate what youre saying you dont have to translate from I speak very well I translate for me might translate for you that North Carolina as opposed to Massachusetts I understand that man otherwi basketball basketball people know basketball know exactly what Im talking two minutes gone here in the fourth frisbee tosson they might know which you do a great job of I havent mentioned that tonight I have I high low last Touch by Jordan to get a nice job there ball over just continue to defend the basketball in the air and not let Clark get the get the position in the catch we said it a moment ago well say it again now big possession offensively for Music t Willis back outside six to shoot for AT demaya Tucker beat you off the Music bouns CH clock violation great job defensively Harrison got out deflected the ball took them out of their offensive Rhythm tried to go behind the back into the last second to get the shot off not able to do so good defensive possession by Wake Forest we just saw Williams get her first points of the night from the free throw line turoff doesnt give Williams a touch down this floor missing the three instead brone Davis gets it around to the left side for lock lock had it poked Away by turoff last couple possessions wakes done a nice job moving their feet getting their hands in passing lanes theyve got to make an be a onesided team in other words not let them get the ball in the middle of the floor and then reverse it keep it on one side of the floor and defend that side see here broke the other side shot clock single digits five four lock for three Willis on the glass creates a fresh possession darl Robinson Taps his head brone does the same calling the play try to put the post here dri out come back in the screen Bron Banks it in Great call by coach Robinson and staff work the ball on one side use the screener high and drive in the Applause middle good friend of mine one of their assistant coaches Mike Moses hadnt seen Mike in couple years was a high school coach down at St Paul had some success was in West Kentucky comes back to ENT says got a daughters a pretty good player over at uh over at Dudley so uh Mike Moses good to have him on the staff keep our eye out for her yeah nice move there by Conley but couldnt finish in the story of the Music night taking time and watch this toce brone using the Clark ball screen again throws it away this time Williams with Dave Davis Williams no Jordan fouled great job by Conley to get in the passing Lane and that leads it to break thought there might have been some contact there for Williams got to play through that didnt get the call but wake for us gets a second chance Music opportunity Mala Kohls is about to trot to the scores table but my guess if shes coming in for the free throw shooter here and I could be mistaken and I am Conley departs Andrews is going to come back in and get the Freshman turov bring Coles in the ball game along with Andrews you got to get some rebounding and the opportunity to have been there to score in the paint Co can give you that Andrews can give you that perimeter Applause basket both williamss and Harrison struggling to score in this ball game Harrison offered such a good start if na just got to be the leaders and find ways to win this game one for two at the line for Jordan shes got four points des back within six for entt you keep the ball moving youre smart with your passes and your Applause Music shots Tucker in the corner goes past Williams great defense by Harrison stripping it from Clark Williams sets her feet missed the three and then Harrison was bumped from behind by her own teammate Alyssa Andrews who knocked it out of bounds it was a good look but that shot was never online by Williams never was online thats just frustration right now and friendly fire yeah Andrews F her teammate Harrison going for the offensive rebound they both were right there Im old school in a lot of things and one of them is communication I just think that players dont talk as much as they used to you got to get teams to talk communicate that should never happen GL youre aggressive but you got to talk I got it you got it dorsy missed it Williams pass the Midway point in the fourth Harrison thought about it Applause AT not in the zone right now see if way can run something against the manto man D looking for Williams being guarded Byer Kong 24 Harrison off the dribble you got a hand check its the fifth team foul of the quarter which means Kai Harrison will shoot two when we come back 433 to go Aggies by six Cardinals very very challenging but very competitive schedule for for entt uh Mercer game team that L Forest knocked off last year obviously playing Louisville and then um theyve got ston I think and Bon cookman to end out before Christmas so a chance to get some Ws I think and find out a lot where they going to ca play they LED Georgia by eight at the half but could not finish off the Bulldogs we were tied of the half here tonight agie led by as many as 11 in the third but the Georgia Tempo and this Tempo were totally different they they just didnt make plays from a lot of Vantage points and they hadnt missed opportunities like that turnover they were in the Georgia game theyve had great shot selection today you know 17 of 49 but uh you know three of 12 shooting but theyve done a great job on the glass of the ages and forcing wake Force into as my last count 17 turnovers yeah that last turnover for AT was their 18th of the night not not been the prettiest game in a lot of ways it dont matter get more points in the other team out comes in doubt with four minutes to go Elise Williams her first field goal of the night and a chance for a threepoint play good job I thought might have pulled up right in the paint and taken the short jumper but I love the aggression that time by Elise Williams goes inside know theres going to be some contact and says finally finally I get a basket first foul on Tiana Music Curtis Williams to make it a twopoint game yes indeed lets keep a mark on that 353 Williams gets that basket dis he just about a way the flow this games going to go that might been the thing that turned her switch on thats the first twopoint field goal for Wake Forest in the second half is it here we go four threes one two since halftime but Ws only down two great move by Tucker off the dribble demaya Tucker in double figures with 10 we talk about the length and the athleticism of Tucker her ability to go from outside inside the out just nice little basket strut they find as she makes the layup Kohls looking for Williams its stolen away by brone Tucker fakes it takes it brone back outside for dorsy no reset on that didnt draw Iron maybe it did well the shock didnt shot clock did go back to 20 here we go watch Tucker just drives right down there but where did where did all that action start top remember we said getting the ball out of the middle of the floor amts been able to get the ball in the middle and get it to reverse or start there theyve had good things to happen I think TSA green said 13 seconds and they accidentally put it at 13 so theyll get that rectified that would be some home cooking for w for shot clock Applause operator new look at the scorers table this year no Jeffrey Griffin after a long run great PA announcer Courtside replaced by Joe Christie whos been the voice of the Millis Center and the the cubane center over in High Point for a long time great to see Joe and just a lot of big basketball events hes going up to Brooklyn tomorrow to be at the bar playay center its a good Gig if you can get it in it talking for a living there we go go to ball games and talk about it thats a wonderful thing 13 seconds on the shot clock t leads by four we tick under three minutes to play all right Clarks a good passer from there Clark back door dorsy free throws coming ant uses Clark a lot of ways but primarily there her ability to catch the basketball and make plays 15 18 ft away she does make a lot of bad decisions nicely pass dorsy on the cut Alex grrs just fouled out five fouls 24 minutes 27 rebounds for Scruggs replaced by Jordan dorsy has two at the Applause Music line first free throw attempts of the night for Jordan dorsy andt goes in having shot 71 from the free throw line yeah they were good from the line a year ago as well yeah yeah all right one of two for dorsy shes got seven fivepoint game here we go I look I look at Williams but I also think about getting the ball in Andrews hands especially on the wing Harrison cant go to sleep and not take her opportunity to drive by someone and take the little 10footer precious seconds ticking away Megan Jeb are calling another play Harrison with seven on the shot clock all the way to the rim There You Go Harrison can get that most anytime she wants but shes got to be understand she got to be willing to be a shooter how far can she go Harrisons got Applause 10 brone traveled Music all right Wicks got the ball down by three with 209 to play Clark into the game for defense coach Robinson continuing with the full court pressure well I I I pressure but I think maybe because of the fact gors got the four fouls but you may drop back hes going to put her on Andrews and see where this goes a hes just got to be smart Harrison can penetrate Jordan for the tie dorsy Wards off any Ln Forest rebounders is the ball rolls out of bounds he think back to the number of times when wake has had good looks and maybe gone one time and not one and none that was a nice look for the freshman timeout AT tell you this next 106 seconds of game action could take a while cuz each teams got three timeouts left including this one that Terrell Robinson just called Terrell Robinson proud product of fville North Carolina the same high school as Lake Forest Alex BR E E Smith golden Bulls see a game or two there in your dead I actually have I actually have right across the street youre rning the corner from fa state state had a big win last night and top ranking gusta team so yeah its a big basketball down here Robert bricky old Alam F state three players with four fouls for the agies scrug is already fouled up but no one else has more than three for the deeps SM he youve said it a few times here in the fourth quarter but every possession is precious the rest of the way for both teams and Im going to say it a couple more times because its very true right now got to have a defensive stand if you got to if youre wake and you got to get an offensive play if youre the aies theres your defense Williams steals it away value the basketball shot fakes and ball fakes huge possession here here we go Evan the 20th turnover for the agies Williams got a nice match up driving on Tucker Alise draws the foul with 117 to play and a chance to get it within one at the line great offensive set that time by coach jebie and the decks get the ball in the isolation let Williams go down heel post up or take the midrange jump shot not a lot you could do defensively she was behind so now can she make the free Applause Music throws Megan Jeb called Elise Williams a threelevel score shes the teams leading returning Music scorer and she sinks a pair to make it a onepoint game seven points for Elise Williams all here in the second half oh I love this matchup Harrison versus dorsy good offensive player very good own ball Defender how you feel about brone vers Williams Brons pass finds Clark and one I would say Williams had the advantage because brone was driving putting the ball on the floor shes more of a catch and shoot player but she makes really good decisions so you like having the ball in her hand theres the drive the Baseline cut her got to have hands in passing lanes and we told you at the beginning of the game that Clark had really good hands soft hands knocks it down threepoint play makes it a fourpoint game with 548 to go timeout Music AT what a great pass from Bron watch this this is drive and you do a good job forcing to the Baseline and getting help and theres good play without fouling and then you just roll to the basket and Clark caught the ball the only place that she really could use it was up high and just a little bit off center and shes able to take it right into the shooting Zone its an excellent pass by prone and even better play Shia Clark Wake Forest basketball trailing by four Music any foul either way would be two free Music throws wake doesnt score here and t gets the rebound even if theres 45 seconds to gol think you got a foul got start you got to get more possessions Williams right back to Kai Music Harrison ant is in the zone Williams shoots over it missed it right loose ball foul on Williams aggressive pursuit of the rebound at Williss expense and Williams ran her over to pick up her third Williams is getting good looks just not comfortable that shot didnt hit anything and this great hustle trying to make get the rebound follow your shot but uh a better shot by Willis getting between the basket the ball and the player so now she goes in the free throw line ha Willis from San Jose California always had the girl the goal of earning a D1 scholarship which she did turned into a really good ball player big free throw well shes shes a daughter I should say son shes a daughter shes got a brother too shes a daughter of a coach both her parents or coaches as well so shes fundamentally sound you can see it at the line there sixpoint game timeout wake for course Deeks will advance the ball 424 left wake in danger of falling to one and two for the first time since the 20134 season that was Jen Hoovers second year when wake had Road games at Marquette and at Delaware among their first three contests of the Season coach jebie is second season and wake in danger of heading to Hawaii with a sub 500 record if they cant rally quickly here you got to play the clock game we got to play clock game we got one timeout remaining if you wait for us so this has got to be your quick hitter but its got to be a good shot on the quick hitter dont just throw something up yes its a time got to move got to move got to move if youre if youre ENT whatever happens you got to secure the Music basketball Williams tough two long rebound to Mid Court Willis tracks it Willis fouled by Applause Harrison cuse Willis is a solid free throw shooter you dont fault her necessary for trying to finish the play normally he might want to say pull it out let the clock run but I dont know if ans got enough points to say okay we got this in the back so if Will is a very sound shooter knocks down these two this makes it very difficult for for WG Forest to get back in this ball game with 268 these are Big free throws that makes it a three possession game yeah and I dont know that youre going to get three possessions again we talked about it being the the child of a coach and see shes fundamentally sound watch her finish High follow through nothing but the bind oh little Rim there pulled up a little short but I love the technique here we go you jinx it there theres no doubt about it Im sure Im Applause probably to the corner for Jordan for three fourpoint game 147 left and jebba uses her final timeout to go to distance and that thats the thing right now is most important you got time and school in your in your area so lets see if they can dial up you know a nice little half court play to get the ball in bounds and and go sioban AR as doer assistant coaches we saw along with my guy Mike Moses Jun so well see theyre going to take this ball half cour you cant go in the back cour but but that scares me because dont handle that backboard situation very well sometimes throwing into the back for forone a fou and shes fouled by Andrews with 116 remaining so that gives up about 3 seconds see if they add a little time to the clock here officials will take a look M Forest one of a half dozen ACC teams in action today NC States clobbering Elon what a win for West Mos wolf pack over the weekend against Yukon siia Rivers ACC player of the Music week got you we you thank you Notre Dame up big on Northwestern 5626 Hannah hialgo the ACC freshman of the week Neel Ivys newest Star in the back court Syracuse up on Cen State 4423 Virginia leads William and Mary by 11 at the half in Charlottesville earlier today North Carolina beat Hampton by 30 tar Hills are number 17 in the nation three and0 for Coach Courtney banghart Pittsburgh falling at George Mason in Fairfax 60 to 52 trying to check to see if there was a malfunction as the ball was inbounded a moment ago CU that 116 was kind of quick I thought clock might have started when the ball was released instead of when the ball was touched theyll sort it out still the aies are in a good position with two free throws coming here for Malia brone whos been their star tonight 15 points nine rebounds and 32 minutes for the senior from Anderson South Carolina cant think of a play down in Anderson just great barbecue spot down there yeah I cant tell you the name of it you know been down there a couple of times going to Clemson or going down to Atlanta or something they got a couple bar couple yeah yeah I just thought about went to the andrewson obviously my minds not a you know obviously my minds not on food right now because this is an important basketball game Smoking Pig down in Clemsons not bad youever been there game card adjust at 12 have been by it I dont think Ive eaten there but its on the list so they added a second and a half to the clock 129 no now 125 we just lost 410 of a second what you hate that all right here we go con solid player over 70 free throw shooter wakes out of timeouts so theyre not going to be able to call one in advance it here two free throws so thats the big one because of that very thing they dont have a timeout so if she misses this put pressure on the basketball and use clock if she makes it hey thats even Music better one of two wakes got a hurry they need five points in 10 seconds Kai Harrison gives it to Elise Williams good look at a three wont go bone has her double double and AT has their first win over an ACC opponent since they knocked off Clemson to December of 2019 the Aggies come to the Jael and walk out with a
