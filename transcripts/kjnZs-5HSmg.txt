ing the castle guard is filled to the top Rejoice basketball fans a day that youve waited for A new college basketball season is underway in Southwest Virginia Having two teams with a lot of newcomers were going to be introducing a lot of new faces on both ends of the floor Hoffmeister the D3 transfer drills his first points as a Buccaneer a D3 transfer you mentioned at 24 years old and can stroke it cheering Here is Abdales running the show a fellow transfer newcomer Bedford off the mark Dton Southern has a lot of quality scorers Three surprise starters tonight but they have a lot of people who can score the basketball for coach Nimley in his second year Hanssberry has shown the range in the preeason Misfires Itll stay with the Hopkins Yeah Hansberry is one of the newcomers Transfer from West Virginia Kind of a combo forward Can stretch the floor like a stretch forward but can play down low too Hes going to be really a big key for Mike Young Hanssbury wide open gets his own miss with help from Bedford Oh runner outside the lane drops I think this is one of the things Virginia Techs going to be better at Offensive rebounding Theyve got a lot of athleticism to go with a lot of depth Mville transfer Williams wont have a possession to work with An offensive foul Yeah nice play there by Bedford fighting through the screen Offmeister with the offensive foul Virginia Tech with a lot of new faces out there Evan just four of the 14 players from last seasons roster on the 2526 Virginia Tech team Here is of Dallas one of the top international prospects 10 to work with Abdales working creating and scoring his first points as a Hokei If you want to describe him quickly playmaker is what he is Coach Mike Young said when he signed his versatility off the charts Corner three Wont drop front iron Hokes in transition LEWAL CLIMBS THE LADDER A POSTERIZED MOMENT FOR TOBY LWAL DID WE MENTION highlights in the open Not even three minutes into the young season Welcome back Toby Lwal In transition and this is something else youre going to see more of for Virginia Tech this year than in the past Multiple people can push it and with more depth and athleticism theyre going to run the ball when they have the opportunity I think you said in the open partner someone in terms of around the country maybe the top highlight maker He really is incredible Incredible leaper Incredible just quickness and speed He beat everybody down the floor Bryson Blaine from Richmond Virginia Open look for a moment and ties it Yeah the home state guy You know he was looking forward to this He went to JMU then GF Coast Junior College and now at Charleston Southern can really score Hanssbury open rebound for Blaine and the Buccaneers Hansberrys had three good looks Bookies with numbers again behind the back Bedford with the right hand Wont drop off the window Dustin S is unique on offense Youll see an open middle almost all the time Good for back cuts Drives to the rim Theres that open middle And theres that back cut right on Q And the follow through from Reese Jones the senior out of Fort Washington Maryland Yeah for a Southwestern transfer The mayor on campus knows everybody more than the coaches Knows everybody on campus Great personality Bedford Hes been active early Sophomore Johnson Great find Great finish inside for Hansberry Theres the versatility of Ammani Hanssberry We see you Weve seen him shoot the three hadnt connected yet but there you see him on the post up Sealed his man beautifully Entertaining opening four minutes Thrilled to have you on your Monday night Blaine too far in front but a whistle and a foul A Toby Lewal What a play here Matt in transition The beautiful pass by Tyler Johnson and the emphatic finish by Zomi Lwal Traffic in every game that you watch this season no matter who youre watching Coach Nimley mentioned before this game can you survive those first four to six minutes of the first and second half And I think its fair to say his team has done that Theyve done it very nicely on both ends of the floor Hookies have missed some open looks Sumler rejected by Abdulis Couple of newcomers on the floor for the Hokes Lal surveying Abdollis off a screen Rise and fire Jay too much and a foul on Charleston Southern Good hustle by Gerdo the freshman We told you a playmaker both ends of the floor Beautiful play right there using that length all of 69 Thats his first second team Worth mentioning as both teams make a couple of subs Alain Sumler is back on the floor for Charleston Southern arguably their best player who missed all of last year Yeah definitely their best player Very confident player a catch and suit kind of guy Average 14 points a game two years ago Hammonds coming off of that big exhibition against Xavier in which he scored 20 off the bench Hansberry another open look and he drills it Yeah thats what a shooter does Forgets about the last one make the next one Chelsea Southern has been very good on defense Thats the kind of thats their identity But this is a good offensive team too for Coach Nimley Abdales had it stripped from behind by Franklin Mville transfer Luke Williams Blaine great shooter ties it at 11 Yeah just shooter in all caps Red ink whatever you need This guy could really shoot the basketball Shot 43 last year at GF Coast State Tied at 11 Back and forth early first half Abdollis shows the range Too strong back rim Thats last touched by the Buccaneers Nice job inside out right there Buccaneers Lane rotation not quick enough He made him pay Thats one thing that coach Nimley mentioned to us the depth but what they did from a roster construction standpoint in terms of the backwards Yeah And they struggled to score a year ago especially without somewhere in the lineup but now they have multiple people who can knock down shots Hanssberry top of the arc Hes had some decent looks Yeah One thing when he shoots the ball outside other people have to go to the offensive rim Sumler all the way to the rim Tough finish with the right hand Yeah it might might be limited minutes wise as he still recovers from the injury but this is this is the guy who makes Charleston Southern go Hanssberry Hell try another Charleston Southern a twopoint lead Long triple Blaine hits again Yeah way beyond the arc Youve got to find him and get there and contest that shot Time out Mike Young and the Hokes get there in time to contest the shot Out of the Mike Young timeout very aggressive defense good physicality Bedford high off the window makes it a one possession game Befords a heck of a shooter but he has proven he can get to the rim and finish two Shoot guard turnaround shot wont fall from Bryson Blaine Bla put it on the floor that time but good job contesting and finishing the defensive possession with the rebound Hanssbury leading Virginia Tech in scoring with five points picks up his first personal in a little bit of foul trouble in the exhibition game against Dukane Starting front line goes out for Virginia Tech Both teams excited about the depth they have coming into this year Yeah and you a lot of coaches talk about that and then by the time you get to January and February theyre down to six or seven But I think both these teams will play close to double figures all year Johnson scoops up the loose ball TRANSITION THREE Ben Hammond swirls around and a foul on the floor against Charleston Southern Nice job on the fast break Push it down kick it opposite for the wide open shot Ben Hammond is really an improved player from a year ago Had some great moments down this stretch especially in league play but uh he has gotten off to a really good start in this fall prep Freshman Gernck Bedford takes it himself and scores again Yeah I think if you close out on a shooter like that hes got to be able to put it on the floor Bedford has shown that ability The transfer from UNLV Williams behind a screen converts Went under the screen that time and Williams made it pay to transfer from Mville out of St Louis not Mville out of Tennessee or Marvel as they say Im going Mville laughter Either work Johnson has space and drills the jumper Another guy who has really improved in the offseason One of those returnees for Mike Young Sumler through traffic Too strong with the left hand Little euro step Johnson guarded by Sumler 12 to shoot Hammond looks to create fades shoots scores Really nice skills Really good defender a year ago offense grew more confident as the year went on and came back and has picked up that offensive game Oh Larry one of the more improved players misses Hooks in transition JOHNSON SHOVELS FOR GERAK AND FINISHES through contact for his first collegiate points Johnson has shown a real knack of finding the open man Hokes lead it by two midway through the first half front court Gird being one of them Yeah they really do And uh you know not playing tonight is Antonio Dorne uh a 7 foot 230lb freshman out of Germany who is outstanding There you see Antonio on the bench sitting out a oneame penalty for Im not sure what its it has something to do with his eligibility and the team he played for in Germany Good news Hell be good to go on Saturday Exactly Its great to have you on your Monday night Evan Hughes M McCarthy the rest of our outstanding ACC Network crew Opening night of college basketball Virginia two fouls on Bedford We see Pasha from Delaware checking into the game Isaiah CAA rookie of the year last year at Delaware cheering Charleston Southern had a 1611 lead The Hokes played some good basketball the last couple of minutes Larry tightened up on the defensive end locating the shooters And speaking of that another steal Posasha intercepted Well read by Nate Bradford Pasha trying to make that extra pass Probably should have gone ahead to the rim Big point guard Rafford rightwing three Walt fall Shoot Jumps on the baseline Keeps the ball in play Pasha pushes the ball Very good at that Good vision 65 Shot over 51 from the floor last year Efficient when he takes shots as he does there Right on Q partner His by five Blaine feeling it Drills another first half three And were under the screen again Youre not going to be able to go under on him without some help Blaine has 12 first half points Last year at G Coast State averaged just under 11 a game Four threepoint plays Four out of five from long range Gak second effort Another chance for a threepoint play How about the freshman mixing it up on the offensive glass We said that might be an area where the Hokes are improved over last season with athleticism and the size that you talked about Its the miss up keeps the ball up very fundamentally sound Watch him not bring the ball down Keep it high Go back up through the contact Well Gerak has familiarity with somebody on the floor right now Ben Hammond Those two spent two years together in high school You got Christian from out of out of Charles Town West Virginia but went to school nearer to DC Thats a heat check three there I dont blame him Four for five Lal going to work A foul on Jesse Hoffmeister Havent seen a lot of post up possibilities for baskets for the Hokes but Lwal was backing his man down that time Well all is stronger than a year ago You know was you know put his name in the NBA draft and then pulled back out and decided to come back and play for Mike Young And I think it was a great decision and certainly a great decision for Hoke fans College basketball fans saw it with that highlight dunk contested jumper at the foul line Rebound for Sumler Pushing Sumler stripped Excellent defense from Ben Hammond We talked about how good he was defensively even early on last year SHOOT HAND IN HIS FACE No problem Shoot is going to get more open looks this year because of the playmakers on this basketball team Blaine left elbow into the hands of Hammond Hokes will slow it down Pasha does it by himself is fouled and well head to the foul line when we come back Charleston Southern had an early fivepoint lead The Hokes playing really well up by eight Go back to November 12th 1991 his dad Demetus played with a professional team in Castle Coliseum against Virginia Tech That used to be all the rage Foreign teams would come over and tour and and play an exhibition game against teams in the United States And u and of course the Russian team usually I mean the Russians the Greeks the all the Eastern European teams were very popular and touring the United States and playing against the college teams Can you make that up though halfway across the world All these decades later his son would be playing for Virginia Tech Very cool Hes leading by eight Sumler one of the top players for Charleston Southern connects Really nice design Sumler set a back screen His man had to help He steps out to the perimeter and the defender couldnt get there in time Really well designed Williams into the front court DALLAS SWATS THAT AWAY EMPHATICALLY WHAT A REJECTION FOR THE FRESHMAN Slow it down for a moment Turns Hanssbury Lw goes all the way in and is fouled Toby Lal What a sequence That was fun Abdales has been a couple been on the defensive end with a couple of blocks You dont think of your point guard as a rim protector but watch this hustle timing Get out of here Beautiful shot right there Theres that sense of urgency Mike Youngs hunting for He wasnt happy with the turnover but he was very happy with the block Mac what is it about his game that makes him a future NBA type player Well you know when youre that big and that skilled that helps to start with but he has just great vision Uh you know I mentioned that you know there have been some great players here and and I know Im going to leave somebody out but Alan Bristo was an incredible passer Played played a long time in the NBA because he had great hands could catch it and really pass the basketball Thats back in the early 70s But thats what he reminds me of He has such great vision and really good skills He is the highest ranked recruit in program history outside of Dorian Finny Smith Theres a name for the best outstanding player Blaine thought about the three and foul on the floor against Toby Lewal Yeah a lot of contact there on the ball screen and rescreen Coach Young doesnt agree with that call Luke Williams might be one of the best point guards that coach Nimley has coached Kind of a pass first guy but he can make the open three as weve already seen Sumler hesitates Second effort No third effort Fourth effort Finally into the hands of Ammani Hanssberry All the way up ahead JOHNSON THE LAYUP LIKE A QUARTERBACK to a receiver Can he pass What great vision And then deliver it 34 of the length of the floor Largest lead of the first half for Virginia Tech as Ola Larry finishes through contact Yeah the hometown product right there from Charleston 13 snorts says hes the most improved player Look at hustle Hustle and then watch this pass Has to be perfect and it works Abdales showing a little bit of everything in this first half Little NFL kind of action right there No doubt On the run in stride Weve seen some highlights in this first half MacArthur Yeah And and quite a bit in transition which we talked about in the open that that we thought the Hokes would be better in transition than than theyve been in in several years cheering Lal all the way to the rim there Just kind of elevates Everybody else looks like theyre grounded 3327 Virginia Tech opening night of the college basketball season Carson Southern just blows up dribble handoffs They they are really aggressive A Dallas step back three swirls out far corner Coleman off the nylon Coleman hunts those threes An energy guy transferred by Auburn Montgomery Johnson working for the offensive rebound trying to find Gerak Johnson was very good on the offensive glass a year ago as a freshman 51 offensive rebounds and I think he will be again to be one of those athletic running rebounders First Virginia Tech freshman with a double double since some guy named Justin Bibs last year Justin Bibs big lefthander was pretty darn good He could stroke a threepoint shot too Fun player Just over four minutes until halftime The left hand the hook Reese Jones Hes really good Big athletic didnt get the start tonight but you can see why hes probably going to be in that lineup going forward Gerak just short from the elbow Charleston Southern can get within a possession off the deflection Jones stripped and nobody has possession yet and then looks like stepped out of bounds Jones stepped out with possession of the basketball So when we come back hokey basketball Virginia Tech leading by four on Open Southern staying in this game from the threepoint line Virginia Tech has balanced scoring Nine people have played nine people have scored Abdales goes down hard and hes asking for that to be on the way up The Hookies have dominated in the paint with 18 dominated on the offensive glass but Charleston Southern is 7 for13 from long range Yeah I dont think theyre going to give him the continuation but it is one and one Hooks last year 71 at the line as a team to line for 17 Seventh and eighth free throws of this first half for Virginia Tech Thats a great sound isnt it You missed that sound right Nothing but net Its just great having basketball back Its the great Joe Dean a voice in the SEC a long time Call it tickle the twine Is that the best sound Ring music Is that the best sound in sports It is if youre a coach laughter Great answer from coach M McCarthy Charleston Southern Seven first half threes BUT THE BACK DOOR opened the flush from Reese Jones Yeah we talked about big athletic strong active and hes been a present since he came in the game off the bench And cheering one Toby Lewal I told you he was the leading scorer from a year ago leading rebounder and he is stronger than he was a year ago Beautiful pass beautiful back screen there by Sumbler Set that up And on the other end the ball screen and roll and playing through the physicality of Reese Jones involved in the play on both ends And he takes the seat with that foul Wall gets his own miss on the tip Another opportunity for this Virginia Tech offense of Dallas steps back and misses Gerak showing the effort but its buccaneer basketball Mac what have you seen from Christian Gerdak in this first half Extended minutes Very aggressive playing hard Not a not contact is not a problem for this big freshman 260 pounder A whistle foul off the ball on the baseline Tyler Johnson whos done a really good job He he has uh transitioned to playing Ryson Blaine and hes done a nice job of fighting through screens and and having a sense of urgency that we talked about that coach Young is looking for but this time he sends Blaine to the free throw line Good line for Charleston Southern number 11 Bryson Bla Bryson Blaine we mentioned from Richmond Virginia started his high school career at LC Bird cheering James Madison for a year the Jo route and then now at Charleston Southern Hoffmeister with the foul right there A s in Virginia Tech the full length of the court to shoot two free throws Fouls on Charleston 12 his third personal foul The wall was 64 a year ago Good luck Obviously thats a number hed like to improve on Went through the entire draft process and got the feedback decided to come back Coming up Saturday morning the ACC huddle crew will be on grounds at the University of Virginia where the number 12 Cavaliers host Wake Forest Well have all the best analysis music and previews of all the action in the ACC It all begins at 10 am Eastern on ACC Network and the ESPN app Well all two for two He shot 37 from three a year ago but all the coaches think he has improved in that area 37 isnt bad Long three Sumler down That way beyond the arc He was on the logo wasnt he Part of the V of the VT at midcourt HAMMOND BIG REJECTION on the other end from Ola Larry Good and knocked it off Hammond as he was out of bounds So Charleston Southern ball Theres the deep three going under the screen again And then on the other end Ola Larry the Charleston the local product for Charleston Southern with the block Its a fourpoint game nearing halftime Rafford throws that away and Nate Bradford Two brothers Nate and Devin Bradford from Wesville North Carolina 71 and 69 A couple transfers from Georgia Southern and Sienna Very talented Havent gotten a lot of time here tonight but but theyre going to be a factor Coach Nimley off a screen Shoots Lewal Excellent effort to keep possession for Virginia Tech Shes got a wide open look Virginia Tech not shooting the ball well from threepoint land Two for 12 now but theyve gotten wide open looks I dont think Coach Young has begrudged any of those threepoint shots Dak double tries to find shoots Whos that off of Itll stay with Virginia Tech Five seconds on the shot clock Five on the shot clock Coach Youngs teams have have historically been really good in special situations Theyre going to have to be good right here to execute on the sideline out of bounds Hammond teardrop right before the horn Nice point guard decision making Understood the clock Job defensively that time by Virginia Tech pressuring Bryson Blaine whos been one of the top scoring options in this first half Blaine backing Hammonds down Hand in his face Bryson Blaine again up to 14 first half points Blaine at 65 had that height advantage and used it Beautiful fall away Just about 60 seconds until halftime Late in the shot clock Lal lost the handle screaming Charleston Southerns defense comes away with another stop Theyve been very good defensively They They have not really defended the three well although the stats will say that they do Game eight for 14 while Virginia Techs only made two of 12 And Virginia Tech has dominated in other areas but that threepoint shot is a great equalizer as weve seen in college basketball Leading scoreer in the game Bryson Blaine his Charleston Southern debut Spins turns short gets his own miss and is fouled on the way up Bryson Blade back at his home state really wanting to make a statement and he has foul of the half against 14 points six rebounds and going back to the free throw line This is discussion about who the foul was on and it ends up being on shoot Hokeis with three players on the bench with two fouls a piece and that has uh contributed to the the lead shrinking here toward the end of the first half and thats three starters Bedford Johnson and Hansbury Meanwhile for Charleston Southern Bryson Blaine is playing with two fouls Jesse Hoffmeister Reese Jones they have three personals Checking in for homog number five sincere Here comes Sincere Jones top 10 recruit in the state of Virginia according to 247 Sports Coach Young said he is a flatout competitor with a nose for the ball when he signed Very athletic been impressive in practice Little pressure by Charleston Southern First time weve seen that Havent been a lot of free throw shot for him to set that press up 16 second difference shot clock and game clock Southern has been pushing Virginia Tech out on the floor A Dallas from the corner misfires Shot clock dark Charleston Southern can tie or take the lead on the final possession of this first half Yeah weve said it a lot but Ginger Tech with another good look from long range but two for 13 now Blaine downhill off the mark and Gach fouled and free throws coming Yeah bad foul right there 4 seconds left Hookies would have been hardressed to get a shot off Now they go to the other end and get to shoot two with the clock stopped Good play by Blaine but good contesting Murdoch again in traffic with a good rebound at the line So have to be alert here in defensive transition Christian Gerak leads all Virginia Tech scores with eight points with one long three from Williams just short Good job by shoot being aware and contesting that shot Both teams starting five on the floor to begin the second half Virginia Tech looking to win its 10th consecutive season opener Bedford a little bit of foul trouble in that first half Left that shorts Yeah he was off to a really good start Had six points early but got his second foul And hes also an awfully good on ball defender too So they missed him on both ends of the floor Rebound secured by Johnson Hes such a good rebounder So strong even though hes only 65 NO LOOK PASS FROM AD The easy flush for Lal His head is always up always surveying the floor Another creative pass from Neo of Dallas Hanssbury cheering draws the foul Yeah and Hanssberry was in foul trouble again in the first half too Missed some threes early but hes a presence in there Theres the nice pass Head up Lauo running the floor I really like the Hookies when theyre out in transition and the no look there That was something he mentioned when he first got to campus and you brought this up Hes a playmaker He wants to find his teammates Yeah he he can score but but he makes plays Bedford rises short front iron Its good dribble handoff situation right there Couldnt knock down the 15footer Lal the block Dallas tried to shovel that to Hansbury Yeah good look in transition again Good hustle by Charleston Southern to get back and knock that out of bounds The wild on the defensive end Wow is he he is such a great leaper Dson Southern disrupting Virginia Techs offense Look how far away from the basket Virginia Tech is Of Dallas directing traffic Hanssberry knocks down his first triple of the second half That struggled a little bit early for three but if youre a good shooter you got to keep shooting them Williams gets by a couple defenders And Ola Larry misses the second efforts Hokes have really guarded that rim here to start the second half Bedford long three down Timeout Charleston Southern Knocking down shots makes a world of difference doesnt it Makes the game look easy Virginia Tech on a 100 run to start the second half Oki struggled from three early Dual penetration kick to Bedford hand music in his face It did not matter at point blank range Buccaneers looking for their first points since the 46 second mark in the first half And Bryson Blaine his fifth three of the game Tyler Johnson got hung up on a screen just a little bit got there a second too late Blaine makes him pay Bedford hangs in the air finishes with the left hand Yeah really good score You You have to get up on him cuz he can make the three and he can beat you off the dribble cheering Hansbury showing his skill pushing the ball down the floor A Dallas straight away You bet Its a simple game and it when the threepoint shots go in hokeis had two in the first half Theyve got three in the first two minutes and change With a nice job there on Sumler is switched off on Blaine Williams on the way up Second effort Jones stripped and that is off of Virginia Tech We talked about Hokes missing the threepoint shots and Bryce Blaine making them Theres his fifth triple of the game And on the other end a little ball screen off of Dallas with the pullup Hes going to have some big nights offensively Biggest lead of the night for Virginia Tech Sumler Excellent find Lewal Not that time Theyre on the rejection So we talked about run them off the threepoint line then contest the shots at the rim Another beautiful pass Edsbury couldnt get the finish Might need to see a replay but partner I think that was another no look pass from Abdales Abdales he is such you know we I know Ive hammered this point but like Im beating a dead horse He has such great vision from all of your years of coaching not to maybe state the obvious question here how hard is that to find someone who has elite vision No its its a gift It its its not something you teach You can either see the play developing or you cant Hands bearing spins and lost it Yeah he hes got skills so uh you you could be excited about him if youre a Virginia Tech fan Can play away from the basket can guard anybody on the floor Hansbury started his career at Illinois then transferred to West Virginia now at Virginia Tech following Chester Frasier Couple new faces on that Virginia Tech bench Well well talk about that at some point Offensive foul on Ola Larry cheering and applause Fouls on Charleston Southern 34 Shay Little Thats his third personal foul And thats the third for the starting center for Charleston Southern Check it back in for Charleston Southern Number 11 Bryson His outscoring the Buccaneers 133 over the opening four minutes of the second half of Dallas floater wont get the roll Hanssberry no look pass the three just short and that was almost tipped in THERES JOHNSON HUSTLING GOING UP AND FINALLY a Virginia Tech bucket Another thing we talked about in the open the Hokes will be better on the offensive glass cheering Blaine Williams into the hands of Amari Carowway Carowway is so fast Long two box out from Hanssberry Hes got the board Yeah the fact that he can stay on the floor and be a presence down low on both ends Virginia Tech with a quick 15 points opening up a 16point lead its largest of the game with four different camera angles and realtime player music and team stats And finally its Florida State and Clemson at 700 Eastern All three games are also available on the allnew ESPN app And as we welcome you back TO CASTLE TYLER JOHNSON gets in on the action baseline out of bounds A Mike Young specialty Didnt get the first option but got the ball reversed for a wideopen shot by Johnson Hoffmeister the D3 transfer off the mark If youre just joining us this was a fourpoint game at halftime Hookies have turned it on Abdales drawing the foul on someone Yeah they you try to body him up but but its tough Hes got some leverage and and hes not as strong as as he will be but uh David Jackson in the weight room has has made some progress with this young man since he got here late in the summer Dallas open look handsberry No On the way up Lal a chance to make it Yes At the free throw line 13 offensive rebounds for Virginia Tech tonight Number one back I go back to something we brought up in the first half Were talking about coach Simley Charleston Southern He mentioned that its going to be important for his team Can you survive those first four to six minutes Did it in the first half not so much in the second half His outscoring the Buccaneers 183 They go home from here Charleston Southern does and host TOA Falls Theyve got a big cross town rivalry game at the Citadel and Mallister Fieldhouse Been there many times That just the way you just said it that sounds like a fun place to see a basketball You always say Mallister Fieldhouse laughter They redid it uh you know a couple decades ago and uh and made big improvements Played all over town They played in a rec center and played in a high school uh while that was being redone and uh big improvements down there Coach Ed Conroy an alumnist there point guard I I think we need to do like a Tik Tok video with you where we just give you a coliseum an arena and you tell us something I think you could do that for every place in America and add nephew of the famous author Pat Conroy Im going to nod my head and act like I know who that is You can tell me after the commercial break I believe you though The lob too high Blaine trying to connect down low with Jones And while the Hokes have made some threes here in the second half and gotten some offensive rebounds the difference in this game is how theyve played defense here at the beginning of the second period Hokei shooting seven for 14 from the floor in the second half Hammond Lewal downhill gets it back Acrobatic finish Multiple tries Theres a late whistle Back to the line he goes Yeah L keep it a little while keeping it on the rim and then Guro kept that ball alive for him too Thats his fourth personal foul So explosive off the dribble getting into traffic in there Theres Gerak keeping it alive Lau going back up and back up again and drawing the foul Its the fourth foul on Jesse Hoffmeister Now worth bringing up Toby Lal at VCU two years ago averaged a little under eight points per game Last year at Virginia Tech a little over 12 points per game What was impressive about the leaps that he took Uh hes just improved in everything Hes really worked on his shooting really worked on his just skills and and it made a big improvement again in this off season when his name was in the NBA draft and he went through that whole process and hes gotten bigger and stronger more confident Hes leading the Hokes in scoring tonight with 13 points There you see leading the team in each of those categories Wouldnt be surprised if all those numbers dont go up of Dallas the board overhead No look pass to the corner Shoot wont fall A foul against Virginia Tech Yeah Tyler Johnson was in a little foul trouble in the first half Picked one up right there And hes their best perimeter defender at this point First team foul against for Charleston Southern 34 Honkies have also done a nice job at protecting the basketball tonight Just six turnovers Last year averaged a little over 13 per game which was uncharacteristic for a Mike Young team Yeah really was And and uh and struggled a little bit in the exhibition and uh and scrimmages uh before the regular season opened here tonight But uh yeah Mike Young has always preached valuing the basketball Was there a number as a coach when you saw that final box score at the end of the night if you saw a number you said Im happy with that from a or no Is one one too many We love single digits You know that thats okay But it it depends so much on the pace of the game too cheering Sumler was uh trying to back shoot down I dont know if uh I dont know if that was a great uh decision but ball knocked out of bounds Charleston Southerns got it with 13 on the shot clock Was one for 12 from the floor in the second half The Buccaneers Carowway really good threepoint shooter Hammond locking him down Ola Larry got to go with three Bradford far baseline turns shoots It was blocked partially by Gerach Shot clock violation again We talked about it a few minutes ago Virginia Techs defense is completely different this half and the biggest adjustments have been what going over top of the screens for the most part but but just aggression on the basketball forcing Charleston Southern to put it on the floor and then having the rim protectors in there in Gerach and Avdales as well as Hansbury and Lwal going back to the free throw line to shoot his 10th and 11th free throws Toby Lwal is just so active Hes going to have a huge year for Virginia Tech We talked about him and Bob Dallas in the open and and they have lived up to the billing in my opinion We talked about this a lot last year but I think it is worth bringing back up Toby Lal he didnt start playing basketball until he was 15 years old Yeah thats what I was talking about Thats you know he hes just going to keep improving Improved at VCU improved from VCU to Virginia Tech and again in the offseason this year Coming up at 900 PM Eastern over on ACC Network Ryan Conwell and 11th ranked Louisville host South Carolina State Then well wrap up the night with the Nothing But Net Crew at 11 Eastern What a way to tip off the season on ACC Network and the ESPN app Yeah Lal on the free throw line right now And we talked about it Shot 64 from the free throw line last year Hes 9 of 11 tonight I know its a small sample size trending in the right direction though Williams has been quiet tonight Blaine has it misfires Lwal head at the rim for that rebound Good save by Hammond right there And with that last rebound Lwal his seventh double double as a Hokei 11 uh 15 points 10 rebounds A Dallas long three wont go Carowway likes the threepoint shot Little short Alonzales with the defensive rebound Wants a screen Shoot Catch and shoot Its what he does best Dallas with yet another assist Five already in the second half cheering Great find as Jones is fouled Williams the feed as shoot got there a little bit late and paid the price actually laughter Thats on Virginia Techs number two Virginia Tech outscoring Charleston Southern 273 in the second half Charleston Now you see pretty big difference first half to second half Yeah And and we cheering you know but again it starts on the defensive end even though the shots are going in on offense Now you cant always count on that but you can count on that solid defense And Virginia Tech has been better in the second half cheering applause Isaiah Pasha Hanssbury Bedford The rebound for the Bucks Hanssbury tried to keep that alive Tipped it up Charleston Southern coming with it the other way Bounce pass and a left hand finish from Alon Sumler Theres that open middle and a beautiful backd dooror pass by Reese Jones Shoot Unable to get the friendly roll With a couple little floaters in the lane not getting him down but getting the shot that they want Fouled on the way up No more free throws for Jones That last Charleston Southern bucket the first field goal since just under the 18minute mark Yeah Franklin with a nice pass there penetrating threw it up to the rim Jones going back to the free throw line The Washington Maryland native line for Charleston Comes from a very athletic family Hes one of six five of his siblings have gone on to play division one sports Check back Thats impressive Hes a big body He is going to be a beast in the Big South 41 blocks last year fifth most in a single season cheering of Charleston Southern 62 offensive rebounds and he looks like he has improved in this offseason for coach Nimley Hes got nine points Thrilled to have you on your Monday night A new college basketball season underway This was a fourpoint game at halftime but it has been all about the Hokes in this second half Yeah Southern one of the things that they pride themselves on you talk about defense being their identity but they want to be physical on the defensive end You saw some of that unfortunately for them Got a little too physical right there sending Ben Hammond to the free throw line where last year he shot 75 And they were physical last year It was a team that was built off of more post and height And oh by the way we even brought up graduating Taj Kelly the Big South player of the year who was top 10 in the country in points per game Yeah they they had some guys graduate and a couple uh transfer portal out but uh they have done a nice job in the portal Weve seen some really good players down here tonight I know they were picked toward the bottom of the league in the Big South but I dont think they have aspirations of of being there They they think they can be near the top of the league And to your point Big South Hoops Hub mentioned they feel that Charleston Southern has one of the best rosters in recent memory for the program is as a jump ball Yeah theyve done a really nice job Got some guys who can score it out of the portal and still fit their culture of being a really good aggressive defensive team Coach Nimley great player himself Yeah alltime leader in Charleston Southern history An assist third all time in score 15 to shoot Franklin an open look Jones the board and turns left hand wont fall Coleman tried to trail with a tip that also doesnt drop Have numbers Shoot Rise and fire Transition three Rebound put back Bedford aggressive to the stripe he goes He ran the floor threw the ball ahead Tyler Johnson picks up the miss and goes to the free throw line Buccaneers Oh sorry Bedford Thought I saw 10 It was a zero Bedford scored in double figures 10 of his final 11 games last year at UNLV Hes got 11 right now and make it 12 Yeah Still learning the offense Still learning what coach Young wants on defense Coming up Saturday morning the ACC huddle crew will be on grounds at the University of Virginia where the number 12 Cavaliers host Wake Forest Theyll have all the best analysis and previews of all the action in the ACC It all begins at 1000 am Eastern on ACC

roll but doesnt get the friendly roll Yeah the numbers made a good decision Just missed the layup No look pass Ola Larrys there Five on four They found the open guy and he was standing under the rim The Shay Olari you mentioned in the first half Coach Nimley feels he might be the most improved player in the Big South this year Shoot Little inside outside game Hands bury wide open Anytime that we talk about it all the time ball gets into paint and comes out that increases your percentage from three cheering Franklin go to the line Pumped on the way up When the defense has to collapse somebodys going to be wide open They cant get there in time Ansbury has really picked it up here in the second half from long range averaged just under 10 a game last year at West Virginia I think thats you know see Illinois to West Virginia and maybe something fans might not have totally realized He can really step out and shoot the basketball Oh he he can guard on the perimeter He can play on the perimeter He can push it on the fast break Really multitalented physical enough to play down on that block too top following Chester Frasier whos back in Blackburg associate head coach As we talk about all the additions to the roster in the offseason that might be one of the biggest laughter Coach Young I asked him I said Is Coach Frasier glad to be back He said I dont know He said I I Im glad to have him back laughter What a story that was in the offseason Coach Young just showing up at his house trying to get him back hands Barry with the left hand right on Q Did we say he had some diverse skills and Sumler slipped somebody who Charleston Southern very high on working back from an injury missed all of last year Penetration back cut and the left hand finish Beautiful play by Ammani Hanssbury A nice pass from shoot Virginia Tech scored 42 points in the first 20 minutes Theyve scored 36 points in the opening 12 Looking for more Hanssberry fighting Hanssberry pump fakes Patience and rewarded Be the second guy off the floor and use that left hand cheering Hanssbury now that that double double 15 and 12 His lead by 30 That guy Neo off Dallas Weve got a cool feature when we come back Shoot Shoot Shoot Offensively uh my game I think uh theyre my three level scorer and I can I can pass the ball pretty well Welcome back to Castle Coliseum Here is of Dallas who you just heard from Nice debut for Neo Six points eight assists Flirting with a double double which Hanssberry has looking to add to the stat sheet And he does Driving from the perimeter Play through some contact down low Blaine miss fires after his electric first half with four threes Wrapping up that point on Neo of Dallas Mack youre getting to know him officially for the first time in a game action What have your impressions been of the freshman uh he he is as advertised you know and and still adjusting to the game still adjusting to the style of play that coach Young wants on both ends of the floor adapting to new teammates but you you you see the talent for sure and uh hes just going to get better and better as he acclimates to the game over here What are some of those adjustments to go from the international game to college basketball in the United States Well that there are obvious things you know the you know the lane the threepoint line the the shot clock the you know but just the whole passion of of the basketball here especially college basketball Uh and again you know even the coaching is a little bit different and that kind of thing but uh clearly with his skill set he can adapt to about anything Carlson Southern showing a little press after really getting kind of stung here by the run for Virginia Tech in the second half Dallas pulls up drills the jumper the size and skill is just uh you know just really hard to defend Blaine stops pops and connects his 63 you cant leave him Tyler Johnson tried to get over the screen back cut a little bit space down and made the shot pretty move in the lane another big point guard with great vision lane wants Another offensive rebound SLER LOBS AND THE EMPHATIC TWO HAND FLUSH from Reese Jones What a nice play Sumler with the lob Jones with the finish Six minutes to go on opening night Posasha pretty move around the iron and down And again he hes still adjusting to the speed of the game and that kind of thing and the and what hes being asked to do by coach Young and this coaching staff Bradford feeds Blaine whos had the hot hand corner three too strong Luke Williams will stay here Checking in for the Buccaneers number two Look at that over Abdales Reese Jones has had a good night He didnt start but hes sure finishing Carowway from the logo through the start tonight The transfer from Eastern Arizona Shot 41 last year from behind the arc Yeah he hes a weapon and he got great speed but the ball can push it down the floor Can beat you off the dribble as well as knock down a perimeter shot Theyve got an abundance of talent out there Little illegal offensive foul Toby Lwal He and Lonnie Hanssbury with double doubles A nice night for the Virginia Tech front courts Not many things have gone wrong for Virginia Tech here in that second half Saw the Greek flag earlier that we didnt get to point out You know they showed that I wanted to make mention of that cuz Castle Guard is here I was talking over you Not at all As Bradford turns and and a double dribble the Castle Guard right now in the double dribble Theyre doing the double dribble sign which is also the the 67 meme Are you familiar with that Mac with your hands I dont want to talk about six Im not going to say it I know a lot of people are rolling their eyes right now but they were doing that Im just stating the facts of Dallas bumps And its great You got everything here in Castle tonight A great crowd a lot of excitement the band the student section Southern number 11 and a great second half by Virginia Tech Checking in for the Buccaneers number one Now Dallas has been to the free throw line twice four two remember this guy was playing in a professional league as he misses the free throw playing against grown men Yeah And hes like affected the game in a lot of different ways here in the second half Eight points eight rebounds He is uh nearing in on a double double himself with nearly five minutes left in the game 17 now his first 17 foul to the line for Charleston Southern number one shooting with a smaller lineup right now with the wall really at center with Tyler Johnson at the four and ADA of course will be bigger than any point guard that he plays against this year standing at 69 the wall wants the three unable to bank it in Hes really worked hard on that and uh and shoot shoot the ball pretty well And of course shot 37 last year which is a good number Sler all the way to the 10 with yet another rebound 15 points 11 rebounds for the senior from London England Heres a size mismatch Carowway on Abdales He knows it Cant put it in Nearing our final media timeout Hookies have held Charleston Southern to just 19 points in the second half No look pass Johnson in the corner Able to keep possession alive Lewal open and one for the senior A nice play We talked about him being stronger and thats a perfect example What a great day for Toby Lewal Many highlight plays Hes going to the line looking for more when we return to Castle Coliseum on the ACC network extra four assists and and really has been the best perimeter defender for Virginia Tech too Hes done a really nice job especially here in the second half Corwal finished at the rim before the media timeout This is his and one free throw Hes 10 for 12 from the strike tonight Yeah and thats thats a big improvement over the 64 that we mentioned that he shot last year Great find and another flush Reese Jones down Franklin with another really good pass Nice assist out of Elizabeth Town Kentucky cheering 10 to shoot for one of the top freshman in the country Naokas of Dallas step back long two into the hands of Jones Yeah nice to have a guy that can can get his own shot like that and Hogies have several of those on this years squad Hadnt been late in the shot clock many times for Virginia Tech tonight Blaine the feed to Trent Coleman Good help by Hansberry presented a basket right there Long three from Blaine from the T of the VT logo HANSSBERRY RUNNING THE FLOOR ONE HAND DUNK What has he not done in the second half Hes blocked shots Hes posted up Hes made threes Hes run the floor Used that left hand on a couple moves Back door cut Luke Williams LOB AND THE FINISH TOBY LEWAL CLIMBING WAY higher than the rim And Abdollis with the ninth assist right there Beautiful pass This game started with a highlight from Toby Lwal near the end Hes got one on opening night Hes with a line change Look at this pass Amdales just he sees things other people dont and has the skill to get it to to the wall and the perfect position to finish the play also from Charleston 12 High School Every player on the floor for Virginia Tech an underassman Under two minutes to go on this Monday night from Castle the Hokes will play a lot of people You theres going to be a lot of competition for all those minutes and uh so this last two minutes is still important to the people out there on the floor and to that coaching staff over there Fouls off number eight Luke Williams Thats his first Well Charleston Southerns not going to come away with the win tonight but Matt they were down four at halftime Shot really well in the first half What can coach Nimley take from tonight Oh I you know they played a really good first half and and hes got some scoring ability that defensively they were very good in the first half defensively not so good in the second half but Virginia Tech had a lot to do with that because they were getting stops getting out in transition and finally making open threes that they didnt make in the first half I think coach Nimleys got to be excited about this squad He Hes got some weapons over there on that bench Yeah Big Souths always a fun league You mentioned theyre picked to finish seventh a team that could be higher than that to say the least Especially with that guy if he gets going Alon Sumler Yeah hes hes shown some real talent You can see why you know score the points that he did two years ago He and and quietly hasnt had a great night but he still has 12 points going to the free throw line right now Also has eight rebounds and has thrown a couple beautiful passes Meanwhile Bryson Blaine with game high 22 points most points in a Charleston Southern debut tonight for the Richmond Virginia native Bryson Blaine Yeah we we need to thank both SIDs for their help getting ready for this game
