in the road Music maroon Yan and Reed to jump Music Center and the Demon Deacons have possession pora state is going to play that pressing manto man theyre going to try to get out of the passing Lanes theyre going to switch everything theim shot the Top Shot blocking team in the league out in transition and its stripped out of bounds it will stay with Florida State heres their starting five Jackson Davis Watkins over 18 points per game B Bowen and then they go with yuan in the middle wait Forest theyll play manto man they dont get out in the passing Lanes theyre more of a helping recover they pressure the ball but theyre not trying to deny the next pass Corner three front rim a Miss from bull Bowen and the rebound Wake Forest they starting hildr Johnson Salis Spillers and Reed thei quick hands Watkins with the steel and the run out dun opens up the scoring you cannot be Lac aicle with your passes against this Florida State team Florida State leads the league en forced turnovers in steals and blocks and theyre the second tallest team in the country HRI inside left it short and its Florida State basketball Florida State as you mentioned theyre one of the top steel teams in the Atlantic Coast Conference and thats a situation where Johnson simply didnt step to the ball you have to step to the ball and make Watkins run into you in that situation very poor start for Wake Forest but of course its hard to look good on offense against this FL State Applause Defense T to shoot for the seminal Yan half hook back rim two of the top defensive teams in the league Johnson spinning a miss and a collision and a foul called on Wake Applause Forest Florida State their defensive r there they are first in the league in Steels blocks top three in field goal percentage defense fourth in guarding the arc what makes them so Elite defensively theyre very quick theyre very long they have guys who are 611 like you and who can switch and guard a guard theyre just very tough to contend with Florida state with the blunder their first turnover and Wake Forest is another team that generates Steels now wakes got to get the ball movement a little bit HRI trying to Jet Baseline lost it on the way up loose ball still on the floor now the shot clock never reset and I dont know that Johnson realizes it for to shoot the lob and the Finish nice catch at The Rim by Spillers now that scramble situation wasnt what Steve Forbes wanted to see but it did get the defense out of position and created an easy opportunity for the decks they have to do that with their passing in Applause Music and keep in mind Reed just picked up a silly foul B Bowen will tow the line for Florida State and Florida State very good at getting to the free throw line and again the defense moves around theres a mismatch inside dayquon Davis is trying to go up against Spillers and thats going to happen theres going to be a lot of those with as much as Florida State switches and Wake Forest has to be patient enough to find it Taylor B going is a 75 foul Applause shooter Florida State as a team theyre second in the league in made free throws per game they get 17 points per game from the Applause line and they score 24 of their points from Beyond The Arc so like wake theyre not a great threepoint shooting team but they get 21 from the free throw line so you got to keep him off the line Florida state with some token pressure just trying to make your run time off the clock and Reed who picked up that rebounding foul now has to be extremely Applause careful Salis seven to shoot double on Reed Salis relocates a threes offline the rebound FSU and wake is well documented there not a great threepoint shooting team there the travel in fact in conference play the deakes have scored more points from the free throw line than they have from Beyond the threepoint L but the way this game has started a little bit disjointed a little bit sloppy this is the kind of game we expected because both of these teams are outstanding defensive teams who does that favor this type of play well Wake Forest thats the defense has been their calling card the entire year so even though we show you Florida States impressive defensive numbers I dont think that works necessarily as a disadvantage to the decks because the decks can guard you too the question is can the decks get inside to score thats where they do most of their damage Wake Forest has 82 points in the paint their last two games they outscored pal 486 in the lane see now blue when hes got this mismatch he needs to get down inside but again Davis switches Johnson double PP cant finish and wake has started one for six from the field well theyve taken tough shots outside driveing kick of three from Dave Juan Davis just his 20th on the year hes less than 30 from distance well we said they are not a great threepoint shooting Music team HRI curling deflection stays with Wake Forest weve reached our first media timeout Florida States jumped out to a fivepoint lead early Coach K said it best he didnt just lead a team he led a program hes an inspiration to an awful lot of young men another Miss by wake at The Rim theyre getting good looks but not getting them down well theyre getting close looks Im not sure that theyre necessarily very good you you go more quick because of Florida State size and youre very conscious of that wake needs to calm down spin move youan had it blocked off the glass thats a great job by Spillers coming to help fivepoint lead for the seals early on Balls got to move you cant hang on to the ball against the seals or that kind of thing happens thats their second steal walk with the hammer taking flight its a 70 Flor to state run and thats the second donk for Applause Watkins well Florida state is an outstanding team when they can get out and go and Wake Forest has already given him a couple turnovers to allow him to get out and go be a long night unless the deak can straighten that up Salis against Watkins who just had that thunderous slam and Watkins is whistled for the foul thats his first personal and the first foul called on the simal well again you get to steal and down the court they come and they are really good when they can play in transition and Watkins lets everybody know about that hes an incredible story he started his playing career at VCU averaged only about seven or eight points per game transferred to Florida State he become the first player in his family to to earn his degree at Florida State and over 18 points per game top four in this Applause conference wake hasnt scored in over three minutes quick Hands by the simal and Salis finally gets the whistle that the Demon Deacons were looking for on this end we mentioned that Wake Forest is not a very good threepoint shooting team they dont rely very much on the three most of their offense comes from getting into the lane and Steve Forbes guys simply have not been able to do that the Florida State Defense has kept them out of the lane has harass them when theyve been able to get in the lane very few clean looks for the Dukes and Salis a 79 foul shooter bricks the first one Steve Forbes 89 and 60 at Wake Forest in his fifth SE season three straight 10 win campaigns and League Play theyre off to a tremendous start 10 and three in the ACC their best start in conference play since the 0405 campaign a deep three from den and the rebound Salis and what a great block out by Blue to keep the top offensive rebounder in the ACC you and off the with the answer well Salis says I see you jir Watkins thats big time well again we talked about the fact they struggling to get into the lane and here hes got to get by three guys and goes up over a sevenfooter good heavens and that was the first made field goal for wake in over 3 minutes and thats his tough a shot as youll see I mean when I say tough I mean a tough guy making it Wake Forest is a slower lower possession basketball team a lot of their points in the paint coach said comes in the half court meanwhile Florida State likes to get out and the Run Yan on the pick and the flare and a deflection and a steal a rim run Spiller hell go to the line to shoot a pair and as we see youre just talking about how wake gets a lot of their stuff in the half court James but wake they can really steal the ball as well and they can get out and go and again those big guys from Florida State they jump at you and its hard to Applause finish Trayvon Spillers 63 for the year from the strike Southpaw knocks it Applause through both of these teams are towards the bottom of the league in threes made per game and threo percentage in ACC play they are the two bottom teams in the league Wake Forest is number 18 at 52 and Florida state is number 17 at six wakes on a quiet 60 run I would say quiet except that uh that dunk by Salis wasnt very quiet heres what were talking about with the threepoint shooting in the defense neither team very good shooting the three both team both teams very good defensively the foul out High called on Omaha Baloo whos been bothered by injuries this season this is only a sixth game of the year and he he really helps them hes 68 weighs about 22 lb is strong enough to play inside runs very well he can be a critical piece for Wake Forest down the stretch yeah remember this kid was a consensus fivestar recruit out of high school turning the corner midrange pullup as an air ball hell hear it from the crowd Belo on the break spins into trouble Powers it up doesnt get the roll fans wanted to whistle that Balls got to come out of there with so many guys around you its going to be tough to score that one a foul jumper doesnt go itll put Jerry Deng at the strike for Florida State a 72 shooter and thats already the fourth team foul called on wake and its on Trayvon Spillers his first personal foul now keep in mind that Wake Forest does not play a lot of guys Florida State Leonard Hamilton likes to play 10 or 11 guys and injuries have prevented he and his staff from doing that this year but Wake Forest does not play that many they cannot afford foul TR that ends the 60 run from Wake Forest and ends a twominute scoring drought for the simal each team really attacking on both ends of the Court weve had as many steals as field goals its been a physical seven minutes of basketball as you would Applause expect Florida state with this token pressure well what that does rake Forest hadnt even set up their offense in theres 18 seconds left on the shot clock and hildr has only attempted one field goal coming off three consecutive 20point efforts here is with the ball oneonone throws into the lane has it rejected at The Music Applause Rim again thats hilds game but hes going into the lane they havent really moved the defense around you can see Thomas come over from the side he had a clear run at him you got to keep those guys occupied or thats what theyre going to do every time you drive in somebodys flying to block the shot second tallest team in the nation Florida States roster features 10 players over 6 7 desperation three with the shot clock winding down rebound out of bounds and itll stay on this end with Wake Forest boy thats a fon Reed hustling after that ball and you like him like to see that Hustle but boy that was close to him picking up his second foul and because that ball hit the rim now its going to be a 22 reset that was a really tough shot by Juke har you brought up the depth in this one Florida States already played nine guys well thats what they like to do Leonard Hamil will tell you your five maybe better than my five but my 10 are better than your 10 Salis drifting missing rebound and the put back dunp for Reed and you can see how important Reed is to this team he just cant be spending a lot of time in this game on the bench those are his first points coming off a career high 19 last time out against Music Applause cow next dead ball will send us to the Under 12 media timeout stepping into a three wide right rebound batted around the Freshman has it finds the cutter Florida State playing volleyball with it Salis hes out of bounds itll be Florida State basketball when we come back its a dont Fest here in Winston Salem Watkins look out simal by Music one one Auburn against number two Alabama at four Eastern in a Sonic Blockbuster then Syracuse hosting North Carolina and at 8 Eastern number 15 Kentucky squares off against Texas at the Moody Center in Austin Florida state is Led wire to wire here in the first seven and change back side lob and a dunk beautifully designed play the slam from Yan out of the timeout well Wake Forest doesnt switch the screens Reed jumps out and it calls hedging the screen and he just got too far away from his man and they found y thats a really nice play by Florida State third dunk already for the simal Reed off the back rim how does Wake Forest get Reed or Cameron Hil going two points between the two they have to do a better job moving the ball and Florida State makes that hard to do but Wake Forest has to fight through that pressure long pass out of bounds and its w corus basketball that is the third turnover on the seminal Reed steps out and just cant get back in time and I think he does a does a very good job a smart play not trying to block that shot he would have picked up a foul but thats a nice job by by Florida State to recognize that Reed is really pushing those screens and to see if they can make him pay for it hrth oneonone against the ball much longer B Bowen and a foul on the floor hildr trying to bang his way inside thats the fifth foul on Florida State and the First on bow hildr is really good posting up but its going to be hard for him to post up on B Bowen whos 6 10 hild is a fighter is going to stay right after you forc B bow into foul its a great example of that seal length that was 64 trying to post up Applause Music 610 pgri step back three and he swishes it through well hes the best threepoint shooter and hes going to have to make a few tonight first three of the game for Wake Forest Applause Florida State shooting just 33 from the floor wake at Applause 26 eight to shoot for the simal youan with four works his way into the lane lost it and another wait for a steel and Yan is looking it to the referees for help and thats a very bad sign this is not the kind of game where youre going to get help from the officials you just have to tough it out Florida States been bit by those five turnovers in this first half double PP and one and Wake Forest has their first lead of the contest and we talked about toughness and this is just a very tough play here Harris loses the ball going in but hes able to recover and in spite of the pressure there are four seminal around him and yet hes able to maintain his balance and score and then a little Flex right there that is a really good play by The Freshman not the flex the drive to the basket all of the above yes there you go check all the boxes its another 60 wake run that was the second foul on Taylor bu boing averages over nine points per game for Florida State this his first game back hes missed a couple with a head injury so its good to see him back out on the court again Watkins has reentered the lineup for the simal had those two authoritative dunks eight to shoot Davis probing driving kick Corner three short thats a nice job rebounding by both Reed and Spillers who blocked out you wake has made three of their last four after they started just two for 12 some rled dazzle H with the Finish little too much complaining to the referees by the guys from Florida Music State time out on the floor Wake Forest has built their largest lead of the night Wake Forest is on an 80 run over the last 90 seconds whats clicking for the Demon Deacons theyre finally getting the ball inside theyre able and I dont mean getting it all the way to the basket necessarily although theyve done that but theyre getting it close to the goal and theyre scoring despite pressure and now I can understand why Florida state would have some objections to the fact that there was no call on that last play for example but but as a player you have to not be yelling at the referees let that man do it hes good at it hes had a lot of experience only one made field goal for Florida State in the last six minutes because Florida state has not been able to get it inside the defense theyve taken a couple of Threes And theyre not a very good threepoint shooting team heres another three thats an air ball out of bounds to Wake Forest case in point Florida State cannot be launched into three even though dang is a pretty good fre threepoint shooter with only one or two passes theyve got to move that defense around and create some opportunities the simal make just six threes per game theyve started one for six tonight but its not one of their strengths they can make them but they dont make them at a high rate and you have to play to your strengths in a game like this Salis Reed nice pass Spillers is open he snaps the net thats only a nice pass because Spillers made that basket Reed has to dunk that ball and Florida States out of bounds that is their sixth Music turnover Wake Forest is on an 110 flurry after the pass out by Reed theres nobody around and Spillers is able to knock it down and again shooting the three is not the strength of Wake Forest either Spillers thats only fifth made three in ACC play shoots under 30 wake has built an eightpoint Applause lead three ball Harris Watkins one on four eurostep stripped and it stays with Florida State on this end sensus to our under eight media timeout Wake Forest has their largest lead theres foul trouble you see those guys come out of the game and hildr just saved that play he wasnt credited with anything but he stripped that ball away from watman now he picks up a foul hildr is extremely aggressive but the referee is never going to let you come from behind and knock the ball away like that thats his first personal foul the fifth wake for his team foul Florida State hasnt scored in almost four minutes they havent been able to get the ball inside they need to find you and around the goal Watkins gives it up a good looks off the back ring from Holt Yan has to handle the ball inside is Florida State taking too many threes that was their seventh thats definitely too many threes you know they taking 15 shots and seven of them are threes thats not a formula for success for the seiners its not their game out of bounds Wake Forest with the turnover thats their third its Florida State basketball its very difficult not to do it but you cant pick up your dribble against Florida State unless you have an Avenue to pass the ball because theyre going to swarm it thats the first turnover in a while for w Force so theyve shot it better they havent turned it over and really theyve stepped up their defense theyve scored the last 11 points Watkins into the lane slicing its blocked hildr on the Run trailing three Salis yes hildr was playing bumper cars down the court but he still was able to make a great pass now hes helping the referees and he just stole the Applause ball its a tie up and the possession arrow keeps it with four to State Wake Forest is on a 14 tord Watkins to get by and then SP hes fallen down and he throws the ball exactly where he needs to go and even though H Salis has not shot the three well this year historically hes a pretty good threepoint shooter was able to step into that one Salis and Spillers each have seven thats a game high for Wake Forest and H takes a blow for a minute he deserves it hes earned Applause it so 140 run Wake Forest on top Watkins that one scraped the front lip of the rim and another three Wake Forest doing a nice job double teaming keeping the ball away from y drout continues for the seminal Reed hes banging lost Applause it dang step through and the finish and that ends a scoring drought that ran almost 5 and 1 half minutes for Florida State and thats their first fast break point in a while they had seven now they have nine and thats whats keeping them close in this game if youre Reed you cannot simply back in and take that much time because the defense is coming offensive foul on the the local product The Freshman Juke Harris fifth we stay in position he established his legal guarding position he can move to maintain it as long as you dont move toward the dribbler and the Way Forest faithful dont like that but that looked like a pretty good call and its a big call it would been the second foul on Watkins find another turnover for Wake Forest theyve struggled when theyve turned it over its been 11 combined blunders between these two teams as Holt Rises up and swishes at Applause home Salis pocket pass to the jam from Harris thats what you have to be able to do you cant force the shot you draw the defense everybodys coming to block it so you find the cutter before they had a chance to get it to you and they didnt throw it to Music him they reverse it to Watkins a hop step stripped wrenched Loose by a demon Deacon Salis looking for a second three and its out of bounds to Florida state that was a little optimistic that was a deep three but this is Salis he goes into the lane and everybodys looking at the dribbler and so Watkins turns his back on his man and that man is able to cut to the basket and get an easy dump nice pass by Sal whats the formula for Florida State to knife into this deficit before the half well they have to get the ball inside they cant settle for threes and I think they have to figure out a way to get you in to handle the ball close to the goal Chandler Jackson operates the point out front now thats easier said than done this is an outstanding way for defense the nice seal and Yan with a gimme thats the formula yes what the formula is thats it second basket for Malik Yan coming off his eighth double double of the season 18 points and 10 rebounds last time out for Florida State in their sevenpoint win over Notre Dame Spillers Banker yes hes up to nine how really a good job by Johnson I thought he might have been handling the ball a little too much but it was a perfect amount because he got the defense where he wanted him and then made a great entry pass to Spillers Spillers is having a good first half Corner three off the mark from Watkins and Florida state is one for nine from distance H St start turnaround thats bretty thats what he do I mean you better get him stopped up around the top of the key or youre not stopping him at all a midrange Sant he has seven ton of contact on the interior in a foul called on Wake Forest Cameron hildr three straight games with 20 plus hes up to seven with this one right here for any stumbles they started very slowly tonight but theyve made 10 of their last 18 shots missed free throw from Ying Florida State LED 9 to2 right out of the shoot heres Joe lardys latest Bracketology last four in San Diego State this week for his team and then BYU from the Big 12 in the secs Georgia well God bless Jo but nobodys in or out yet hild oh he is feeling it Wake Forest has their largest lead its up to 14 but with his ability to drive the ball to the basket and hes out there dribbling you have to say well how close do I want to get to him because you get too close he drives fast he can score in bunches up to 10 points a foul off the ball called on wait well its called on blo and hes battling inside against Yuan and thats a good sign for Florida State it means yuan is fighting a little bit harder for position Applause inside and you dont necessarily want to try to you know get in front of him and fight him for the ball if you can thats great but block it get behind him when he gets the ball wake has been double teaming very effectively and hes missed two consecutive front ends of one and ones and hes a very good free fill shooter Applause rake Forest has made 10 of their last 13 a lot of them from this sky hildr that ones Applause offline largest lead of the night for Music Wake mismatch inside can Florida State find it dashing Baseline nice pass and the Finish from Yan Applause well Yan with a good defensive job against HTH on one end and then the basket on the other pier in the Lane Johnson miscommunication on the route and that is the sixth wake turnover well Johnson had the right idea blue didnt balloon needs to cut to the basket but of course if youre Johnson you dont throw that ball until you see him cutting through the basket wait they they when theyve turned turn the ball over thats been able to thats whats gotten Florida State going a little bit wait Forest aage is just over 11 per game yeah but youre going to turn the ball over against Florida State theres no question about that de point the seals for 14 per night tops in the conference eight on the timer you in rebound we thats what Im talking about you get behind him now hes going to pick up a foul you make him shoot over you you block Applause out thats his first personal foul down in the corner theres an injured simal its Davis dayquon Davis the highly touted freshman top 100 player out of high school well I hope hes okay you know he just gave his coach the thumbs up all the way in your right hand corner he goes down looks like he got tangled up maybe sprained his turned his ankle and went stumbling out of bounds so Hill check out for the simal that puts wake at the line they missed the front end of a one and one out of bounds to Florida State well this is one of the best womens basketball games on the schedule tomorrow night Madison Booker in number three Texas square off against Georgia aore and number eight Kentucky at historic Memorial Coliseum in Lexington coverage begins at 7 Eastern on ESPN 2 and the app more averaging just a hair over 19 points per game the Australian the transfer from Virginia Applause to tend to shoot Florida State once again deep in the shot clock and Watkins have missed three he is 0 for three from downtown and Florida state is 1 for 10 as a unit Harris locking loow thats too early you know Harris can shoot the three but I dont know that you want to do it wkins leaning some Olay defense and a miss when you miss a three it allows the other team to get out and go bre for dodged a bullet there 35 seconds before we break for the half with you and out of the game you ought to see if you can get Reed down low underneath Reed right a twohanded slam from the Applause B down to 5 Seconds simal theyve got a go driveing kick Corner three is an air ball at the horn W Forest they have built a 14 point and you said at the top stand that this could be a potential stumbling block for Wake Forest very much on the bubble part of the last four in according to Joey brackets they 60th in net 67th in k wake possession to start the final 40 minutes HRI over the top Reed little half hook tapped around Florida State clears thats perfect entry pass into Reed thats a shot he really has to make bouncing back door Davis a three Florida State one for 12 offensive rebound thats his first offensive rebound of the day second in the league three and 1 half per contest and a miss Point Blank by the aforementioned un and it stays on this end thats one that he normally takes and just donts but again Wake Forest is doing a nice job contesting those shots without fou nothing easy so far for the seminal thats how you end up only scoring 21 points in a half Jackson with an alley floats it up wide left and a onehanded rebound from weed after an excellent block Applause out rebounding 20 to 19 in favor of Wake Forest a hop step from hriff they left him you know he gets in there and yes he could pass it back outside but you dont want to leave him everybody went away good Heavens he is so crafty a three is up and in from B Bowen and hes their best threepoint shooter in ACC play and the only reason thats a good one as it went in I thought that was much too early in the shot call hes made 14 of his last 26 in the last eight games for the seminal and Tyler Johnson I mean Steve forbess head is going to explode that is a very poor play by your point guard Watkins Florida State missing and the rebound weight and Reed he now has seven rebounds in the game and another great block out but its easy for Reed to block out when Florida State doesnt move the ball from side to side he doesnt have to go anywhere theyve already hoisted three threes here in the first two minutes of this second half knocked out of bounds stays on this end with the Demon Deacons well Wake Forest doesnt want to get in the habit of just immediately driving the ball you want to make that defense move before you driveing Salis lines it up and Reed was just a little slow getting there because he thought Salis might drive the ball largest lead of the night for Wake Forest after that Salis Applause triple hard Music hedge down to five on the timer bbo and all tangled up a jum ball and the arrow keeps it with the simal thats twice in this game that hildr has done that now each time the possession has gone to Florida State I mean you better be very strong with that ball when hildr is anywhere in the neighborhood less than five to shoot for the seminal looking for the lob its bottled up Davis a hoist and a push a foul called on Applause Johnson thats his second breaks to the seminal theyre shooting just 29 Applause Music tonight nine on the shot clock hop step Watkins throws it up and in thats a really good play by a great player but if thats the kind of shot youre going to get thats one of the reasons why youre shoo 29 why has he been quiet tonight just six for Watkins well hes been very well defended I think wake has theyve done a nice job when hes gotten the ball theyve done some double teaming they forced him to give it up hildr has been very good against him remember his first two field goals with those early dunks extra pass Salis Wiggles in puts it through now again it worked out fine but breed needs to dunk the ball Applause wake by 16 once again and Watkins draws a foul slicing in and that you talked about how they defended Watkins and thats how theyve done it when he gots gets the ball and drives by hild and what an acrobatic play by Music Sal that dunk he had in the first half might have been one of the best dunks Ive seen all year just because it was such through such traffic been Salis and Watkins dunp contest early on Davis thats a circus shot tip in wont go and Spillers with the front side rebound Salis wanted Reed he throws it away a run out B Bowen through contact Poes it in and an injury time out thats hildr down underneath for Wake Forest sends us to an immediate timeout well check on the Wake Forest star guard when we come back thats Applause Music a scary scene for Wake Forest fans Cameron hildr hobbling into the tunnel he has left the floor you know I mean this is the way hildr plays at 64 hes trying to block a 611 guyss layup and it looks like he landed very awkwardly on that left leg maybe boy thats oh I hope hes okay that was a tough tough fall what kind of adjustments does Wake Forest make without him now he has 12 points in 22 minutes hes been their energy guy and the adjustments they have to make is somebody else has to get involved maybe Hunter Salis Juke Harris is in the game for him and Harris certainly has a lot of ability he just doesnt have the experience that HTH has and nobody has the grip that hildor has speaking of grit hes going back hes reported into the game so he went out long went to the locker room got checked in uh checked out now hes set to check in Johnson landed the the trees tip in thats an acrobatic play by Harris there you go Johnson hes only 6 feet tall its hard to go in there and get all the way to the basket but because the defense is trying to block the shot nobodys blocking out Harris Watkins big steps Miss its claimed by Reed wake wants to run and Salis did a great job coming over to double team right at the end of that play Salis with the flash hes doubled Spillers for a three and Florida State claims it now Spillers has made one tonight but hes not a great threepoint shooter Watkins trailing a three drills it just the third three of the game for Florida State Spillers is running down the court grimacing grabbing it his hamstring and now he sits down that could be a cramp officials timeout Spillers hell head to the tunnel and Wake Forest will bring in Omaha malalo and Cameron hildr back to the lineup theres hrth with those 12 points hes done it on eight shots you know I think balloon you know he hadnt scored points but I think hes made a pretty important contribution Off the Bench hes got a couple of rebounds I think defensively hes really helped wake wake has gone seven deep tonight hes been part of that rotation here he is for a three short but hes a very capable threepoint shooter three for seven on the year before that one in his five games B Bowen dashing Baseline through traffic Watkins Davis a little bit closer and hes fouled had a three took a couple of dribbles he rises up from about 15 well when youre struggling from three the advice I would give anybody is get closer and so thats exactly what he did and blue a little overly aggressive right there foul is on Reed on Reed thats his second well Reed doesnt need to be fouling dayquon Davis Davis is an 8 2 foul shooter best on this FL of State Applause team well coming up next on acc Network Cooper flag and the number three Duke Blue Devils they host Andre sto yakovich and Cal at Cameron Indoor Duke Rings number three in the latest AP Top 25 Davis drills them both Florida Stak still hanging around theyve got it down to 11 Florida state will hang around theyre not going anywhere and they put their defense is not going to quit and if they can get some offense going now Watkins hes trying to be very aggressive and you want to be aggressive but you have to be smart about it that foul accomplishes nothing 50 ft away from the basket thats his second personal thats the first team foul called on for a state in this stands up Salis cut off and now for Harris and a miss at the rim and an aggressive rebound pulled down by Yan Florida state with a chance to get it down to single Applause Music digits dang attacks and he finger rolls it in too easy time out Steve Forbes and Wake Forest Wake is led by asinia 16 Florida state has trimmed it to nine theyre on a 70 flurry Music today South Carolina and Yukon number one and number two respectively the womens net rankings hows Florida State been able to CL back wow theyve done a very good job defensively and wake has gotten sloppy with the basketball again Parker Frederickson has entered the lineup the Sharpshooter for the Demon Deacons H forced that one and a run out Davis oneonone Applause dang for three tip in will finally go underneath for y three looks for the simal theyre on a 90 burst hildr rushing up the floor draws a foul good Heavens count it and one that was a basket that wake for us desperately needed and as he was coming down the court he looked like he was compl completely out of Applause control second foul on Malik yuan hrth is up to 14 its organized chaos when he has the ball in his hands well its organized chaos anytime youre playing against Florida State because thats what they create but the seminal theyve been able to get out and run a little bit more theyve knocked down a couple of Threes in this half and Florida State they are such a good defensive team if they can shoot the ball well then they they can look pretty good leard Hamilton coaching his last game in Winston Salem hes resigning at the end of the year its a 10point lead for Wake big possession for the simal Watkins after the gamble a three the rebound tipped around into the hands of a demon Deacon Salis feeling the break the long and the CR Spillers on the receiving in when Spillers continues to play extremely well hes in double figures now 11 points four rebounds a block you over the top didnt get the roll but hes headed to the line to shoot two for Florida State thats three fouls on re whos one won that battle on the inside between those two guys well so far I think Reed has done a nice job neutralizing Yan on the inside you know we talked about Yan in his last game with 18 points and 10 rebounds he only has six points tonight Yan has been so much better from the foul line this season hes 24 for his last 28 thats thats his first one tonight though he was 0 for two Applause his first 19 games 59 his last four 86 and hes the guy who gets to the line so its really helpful when your big guy who gets to the line can convert them Florida State makes more free throws as a team per game than anybody else in the Applause conference Salis in some trouble Applause hrid big steps another finish and another Applause Music foul Wake Forest has pushed their lead back to 12 the no look lob and Spillers with the flush Music Music of course nobodys in and nobodys out just yet but we love to talk about Joe still a lot of ball to be played hildr caps off the threepoint play he has scored six of the last eight for the home team W forest and Fredericks been has been in for a while its been he didnt play in the last game I think Steve Forbes trying to go a little bit deeper because how intense this game has been long two from Watkins and thats smooth but Watkins is the guy who can put the ball in the basket and Wake Forest needs to keep the pressure on him because hes a guy who can get very hot and put a lot of points up quickly he has 11 but its taking him 14 shots to get there Spiller a triple team outside hildr H hand continues 21 thats four games in a row with 20 or more well when youre going to Triple team inside and thats fine hildr is not the guy you want to leave Applause Music open the lead is pushed back to 14 in favor of Music way closing in on the halfway point of this second session lot of dribbling and a foul called makes on Spillers he cant believe it and thats its going to be his second Wake Forest has done a pretty good job moving the ball you see the triple team you cannot you cannot leave hildr on the outside and thats what Watkins did you dont need a triple team you need a double team and here that ball squirts loose and theres no need for Spillers to reach in and grab there which he did cuz hild had that one Watkins forcing along to CIS hes foul well he tried to do what he did in the first half take it into a huge amount of traffic and dunk the ball he did previously got an and one that time now hes going to the line for two first team All Conference a season ago averaging 184 points almost 50 from the field Timeout on the floor that was the fourth foul on jir 20 left Hunter Salis one of just three players with over 300 career made field goals in the conference joining RJ Davis at North Carolina and Marcus Burton over at Notre Dame well its hard to get there you dont play that long anymore perfect on the free throw should it be surprising that Watkins is still on the floor with four fouls do you dare take him out no I dont think you can take him out at this point you just have to trust your veteran player that he knows how to play with four fouls a lot of coaches say you save a guy with three fouls but with four fouls theres no reason to do it heres Watkins getting in deep and hes fouled over to the line to shoot two now the one problem for Watkins is he is going to be aggressive offensively and lots of times you can be careful defensively but sometimes you get ahead of yourself offensively he could very easily pick up a charge he drives by and Spillers Spillers gets into him with the body and if you just if you dont jump there you just put your hands straight up in the air thats not going to be a foul thats the third personal foul on Trayvon Spillers well and R canel afford to lose him hes really been good tonight miss from Watkins a 75 Marksman at the line you know he keeps holding his elbow and I didnt notice him fall on his elbow and maybe thats just his habit after he misses a free throw but who knows see what he does after the second Miss he goes over for two that doesnt happen very often Applause you if youre Florida State you have to pressure the Music ball deep three from Salis I dont know what that was all about you know a couple more dribbles and you had Reed on a mismatch inside Watkins looking to take over pulls the trigger Watkins has 13 for the seminal and thats why he has to be in the game and hildr that time went and slapped at the ball very nearly got it so if hildr is in the neighborhood as weve said youve got to be very strong with the Music basketball foul on the outside called on a simal and theyll get you in that is his third personal foul Wake Forest has been very aggressive with the basketball and sometimes it looks like theyre forcing it but overall that aggression has really helped them they are 63 and 14 at home during Steve Forbes tenure in his Fifth Season T to shoot Salis has a big on him Salis Burrows and he rattles it Applause through you know Yan usually does a pretty good job staying in front of guards but a normal guard in Sal are two different beasts the all League player up to 16 points for Wake Applause tonight B Bowen hes fouled at The Rim by Reed and thatll be the fourth on Fon Reed so four on Watkins for Florida State and now four on the Wake Forest sevenfooter Reed Applause Music now those are the kind of fouls that Reed is going to get and those are the kind of fouls that a sevenfooter should get trying to block a shot inside he had what four fouls but two of his fouls were Silly fouls and thats the one thing with Fon Reed he plays very hard hes very a valuable player on this weight Force team but sometimes he commits silly FS they bring in Belo whos played quality minutes tonight hes loged 10 minutes in just his sixth appearance all season long Bowen goes two for two and what Baloo has to do is accomplish the task that Reed was accomplishing on the backboards Reed was getting a lot of rebounds he was doing a great job blocking you and out and thats what blue has to do they dont need offense from him they need defense and rebound wake has made five of their last six shots Salis gets inside soft touch around the basket you saw Watkins didnt go after that ball Watkins had a shot at it nice play inside I didnt see who that was but they blocked out and really created a lane for Sals back through a 16point lead Jackson pulls up and cans a jumper and thats thats thats Jacksons game driving to the basket with a midrange shot hes taking a couple of Threes tonight and thats really not his strength Florida state has shot the ball much better in this second half Applause Music 45 hildr a three wide right well I mean hes been very hot so thats okay B Bing wide open and he snaps the net its to Tri vecta Florida States within 11 hildr missed a three and that creates a long rebound which allows Florida State to get out and run and Steve Forbes called that timeout because you got to find the threepoint Shooters and Bowen is the best they Applause have Salis turned away on the Baseline cross cour skit Frederickson a three B Bowen the aforementioned player for the simal with the rebound knocked out of bounds by wake stays on this end and fredon is a guy who they really expected to make 30 or 43s this year but he just has not shot the ball well his confidence seems to have gone and so he missed that three he you know if hes not scoring hes a guy whos not really going to help you very much and he was a really good shooter a season ago Watkins hes up to 15 for Florida State its a 9point lead for wake and Florida States on a 70 run now remember Florida state only scored 21 points in the first half theyve scored 31 already in this half it was a 14point Wake Forest lead at the break pocket pass nice find Miss from Spillers hes got to go to strong with the basketball you cant do that little Fade Away hook be worried about blocking getting the shot block bull bow and a Music three into the hands of a seminal and a dunk the Freshman swim its down to a sevenpoint lead and the run is a 90 Florida State burst and a steel bull Bowen its knocked out of bounds and its Florida State Applause basketball well the lake forest offense has totally evaporated Florida State doing a nice job covering up Salis and hildr and nobody else out there is able to has been able to break through those two guys have scored 17 of the last 19 for weight bull Bowens hit the floor and hes out of bounds and again Bowen is trying to back in because hes got hes matched up against Tyler Johnson and under normal circumstances thats a good idea but not with hild there ready to swat the basketball away and Dan that is the first Florida State turnover in this half and thats another reason why their offense is cooking a little bit under six to Applause play trying to for speeed hildr but Johnson fell down Watkins Applause Music Applause Music Applause 10 to shoot Watkins has Applause it Watkins against Salis double comes bull Bowen floating firing a three at Short a wake caught a break right there Spillers got too far away from bull Bowen its been a while since wake scored over three minutes without a basket underneath Spillers with the slam the assist Salis boy Salis has done such a great job of that drawing the defense and kicking it and the last time Spillers got it he shot that little Fade Away hook that time he went up and dunked it and thats exactly what L Forest needed thats the third assist tonight for Salis Watkins offensive foul you called it and thats number five on Watkins well Watkins I mean you cant blame him hes trying to make a play but Sal is a very good Defender and of course Salas is a pretty good offensive player too theres four guys around him he finds the open man and then this is just a situation hes got his position established Watkins runs right into his chest thats an offensive foul and Watkins is done a sensational defensive play by the senior Hunter Salis and Watkins he was starting to get Buckets up to 15 points oh now Tyler Johnson has been a little bit shaky here particularly in this second half and so hes got to calm down a little bit to help W get to the Finish Applause Line wake trying to move to 12 and one at home this year Salis out of bounds to the seminal Sal tried to dunk that one I think he just Laing in hes got a basket but I mean youre playing against Florida state theyre coming to block everything you cant blame a guy for trying to dunk it most home wins since the 2021 22 campaign Houston with 62 then wake and Duke with 59 a piece this is a tough environment stays with Florida State on this in 10 on the shot clock just a Haro for 4 minutes left on the game Music Applause clock Reed will reenter the lineup for the Demon Deacons with his four fouls Bo the decks have been working hard and you have to wonder if Florida State theyve played more guys if at this point in the game that might be a factor of course it doesnt help much with Watkins being out but wake up Flor state has other guys who can put the ball in the basket who has to take over for the simal they got to get it to Y its the same deal as in the first half they have to create situations where y can get the Applause ball that foul sends us to a timeout Florida States at the line when we this one out tonight Florida State sometimes theyve struggled scoring not in this half but theyre really good at the free throw line and so Wake Forest has to play good defense without fouling whats been the difference for Florida State in this second half theyre almost 50 from the floor well number one theyve gotten better shots theyve hit a couple of threes and their defense has caused wake Force to hes created some turnovers got him some easy baskets its a sevenpoint game with four minutes on the nose to play and heres the Florida state Applause pressure but when he starts kicking the leg out like that you just think hes going all the way to the basket trying to turn the Music corner fla State doing a nice job preventing him from passing the ball seven on the shot clock cth kept it the entire time and thats partially blocked well that is not a good offensive possession bu Music Bowen Thomas a three got it and just like that it is a fourpoint game Applause and tremendous Florida State Defense the last time D got allow Wake Forest to run anything the simol have ratcheted up the defensive intensity its a fourpoint weight Forest lead well you cant have that kind of defensive intensity on the perimeter without maybe creating some opportunities on the interior Salis bumping and hes fouled had Thomas on him and this will put Salis at the line for Wake Applause Forest well we have six more college basketball games that highlight our ESPN schedule Saturday it all starts at noon Eastern but these are our featured matchups number one Auburn takes on number two Alabama at four Eastern in a Sonic Blockbuster then Syracuse they host North Carolina and at 8 Eastern number 15 ucky squares off against Texas at the booty Center in Austin a whole slate on Saturday on our PPN family of networks I think Salis and hildr and Johnson just have to tough it out on the perimeter and get around their guys and thatll create some opportunities for people like Reed down on the inside Thomas has two threes and he just ran down the court nobody followed him he got lost lost hes a 35 threepoint shooter had just 19 threes all year coming into this one its a onep possession lead for Applause Music w inside of two and A2 minutes Salis ton of contact and a foul called on the floor its on Florida State and its on dayquan Davis just his first one and one time for Wake corus the rest of the way and obviously if youre we force youre going to be going to the free throw line so youre going to have to be able to make them in conference play they shoot 77 Salis as good a player as he is hes not one of their better free throw shooters 73 is fine but 6 for eight tonight after that Miss who takes this shot for Florida State Applause well I think theyre going to be looking for Yan on the inside if they cant get him in there then B Bowen or Thomas I think are your options Davis will keep it himself and he draws a foul and the Freshman going to the line to shoot two and thats the one thing you cannot do is put them on the line particularly Davis fourth foul on Johnson but Johnson has had a tough second half in particular this is this is an amazing comeback by Florida State they just hung in there and they continue their comeback despite the fact that Watkins fouled out of the game theyve done it without their 18 point per game score Davis is an 82 foul shooter thats a rare Miss well now you got to block out if youre the daks Florida state had just 21 points at halftime theyve hung 41 on Wake here in the second half Davis splits the pair well I think their defense has gotten Wake Forest speed it up wake has taken some tough shots theyve turned the ball over and both of those things have allowed Florida State to get out and go a little bit and thats where the seminal are at their best is when they can play in transition and see how wake handles the pressure Applause Reed underneath spinning just his third field goal points in the paint for Wake Applause Forest out of bounds itll stay with fora State on this hand a minute 26 to go they had two looks at the basket from close range theyre going to go look at that Applause Music one fourpoint lead for Wake Forest with a buck 26 to play but Davis drove it in there and he was looking for the foul and he drew Fon Reed previous play is under review and because Reed came then there was offensive rebounding opportunities available Yan keeps it alive it bounces off the rim and that certainly looks like it was off Tyler Music Johnson yeah hes hes got that green wrap on his hand and so its very clear he was the player hustling to the ball that was bouncing out of bounds all right take us inside the Huddle fourpoint lead for Wake Forest how do they hang on with a minute 26 to go well this is terms of field goal percentage this is the top defensive team in the ACC and so your defense ball minute 26 to go flashing open a d for Music y a 206 Florida state run and its been built on their defense and for Wake Forest you got to get a good shot Johnson is termina Applause again I think its hard against Florida State to pick up your dribble when you dont have any place to pass Five to shoot Salis Rises up spits out rebound four to State inside of a minute to play the simal can tie or take the lead they want a timeout theyve scored 20 of the last 26 I Justin Thomas has come in the game here and done a really good job in the last few minutes particularly since Watkins fouled out of the game this is not a lineup youd expect to see for Florida State the closing minutes I think you try to find Yan where you let Davis Drive the ball underneath you hanging and hitting and were deadlocked at 67 I think they called it timeout timeout Wake Forest with 284 to play tied at 67 Wake Forest led by as many as 16 it was 61 45 with 822 left in this game they had it Florida state has come storming back well Yan doing a great job moving without the ball and hes down inside against Spillers and thats a mismatch and Salis came and tried to help but good strength by y to get it up on the board now theres 24 seconds difference between the shot clock and the game clock but if you were W Forest I think you take it youre tied so you take the clock down and you try to get the last shot if they were not tied youd take the first good shot you get but in this particular situ now Florida States going to make it hard for them to do that theyre going to be pressuring everything do you go to hildr or do you go to S at your weight either one of those guys is a good option but I what I think if you go to those guys you might be going for them to create to them to create something for their teammates both Salis and hildr have done a very good job of that tonight you know Spillers has been able to play very well inside as has Reed Wake Forest part of the last four in according to Joe lard patology meanwhile Florida State this would be their first quad one win of the Season just their second true Road win now wake has struggled with turnovers and so the one thing you first thing you got to do if youre the dees get the ball in bounds the Florida state link has been bothersome here in the second half theyre the second tallest team in the country hildr a jump stop what a jump from RE now if youre going to get that kind of shot you take it now you gone and if youre Florida State the shot clock is off but you cannot afford well you might want to hold the ball for the last shot you want to play good defense without fouling cuz its not a threepoint game its a twopoint game and you dont want to put them on the line to give them a chance to tie the game Florida State calls a timeout well wake for his lay off of two feet and watch this jump stop from hildren and its a great cut by Reed again youre thinking about okay we might want to be holding it for the last shot unless they give us something that we can manage and certainly youre going to take a dunk no matter what time it is because now the pressure is all on W on the ball and try to get to the line Florida state is shooting 53 in this second half and you take the first good shot you get Davis B Bowen for the lead itsit there Florida States first lead since it was 1310 oh what is he doing Johnson Miss rebound simal there still 6 seconds to play Wake cast a foul a d from Applause Music Thomas Florida State by three with a second left hild hes fouled hildr is fouled on a half cour Applause he the question is was he fouled before or after the Music horn previous players on your review the fouls called on the Freshman dayquan Davis this is insanity well the the question is did the foul occur before the before the horn o now remember and correct me if Im wrong the clock stops when the whistle blows not when there was contact well thats when the clock stops but the question isnt when the clock stopped when was when was the foul so its not when the official calls the foul its when the foul occurred okay its under review but the big question theres the contact right there and it looks to me like hes released that ball yeah the other question is it a shooting foul yes which would be three free throws for Cameron hrth and 84 foul shooter and how much time is left on the clock after the ru is confirmed itll be three shot foul for R Force three on the game clock three on the clock and hildr is shooting three free throws the big question is Tyler Johnson had lots of time why was he shooting a wild threepoint shot Florida State pulled down the rebound there were still 7 seconds left they got it ahead for a Applause dunk he missed it thats thats tough having to go to the line to make three Florida state will have the lead with three with three you do not have time to catch the ball and shoot it all you can do is tip it so his only his only choice at this point in time is to make this one miss the next one and have a tip got that one to go so now you cannot catch it nobody can catch it you just have to tip it and remember Florida state is the second tallest team in America and theyre getting all the big guys in here because you dont have to worry about handling the ball theyve got five players on this roster that are 6 10 or taller and again you cannot catch the ball the only possibility you have here is a Applause tip a miss and a tip in would send it in overtime Music step its Airborne out of bounds CLK expires and the game is over Florida state has stunned Wake Forest finishing the game on a 27 to
