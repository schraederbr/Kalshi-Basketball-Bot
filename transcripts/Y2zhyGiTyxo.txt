thats the black alternate jersey tonight for Florida State NC States going to wear the cream alternate jersey tonight Lee Cassel with Pat Driscoll Pat Adams and away we go in Tallahassee Florida States lost four their last five 11point decision at Clemson on Saturday night NC States won four their last seven an 11point win in Raleigh against Boston College brings the two teams here to Tallahassee thats Darren Green Jr in the opening Salvo from behind the line Cory and great idea however Baba Miller gives up a wide open layup to kick it out the green as we look at North Carolina states starting five the seventh different starting lineup That Coach Keats has had this season Michael oconnell of course the point guard two guard lineup here is Burns and look at the swarming black around DJ Burns whose first shot bounds away Florida State theyve got warley green Watkins who does a little bit of everything cam corn and thats Baba Miller Florida States missed their first two shots of the ball game the nlls come in eighth in the ACC at 45 from the floor as a team heres horn from three spins out for DJ horn and heres a lead and Cor in the catch and its blocked Away by Casey morcel great job by Casey Morel not conceding the layup going up and getting it cam Corin thats one you want to dunk but of course he didnt catch the basketball cleanly now on DJ bur for it taking advantage of the opportunity you see cam doesnt catch it cleanly thats actually a gold Ting that hits the glass first Casey morcel fortunate to be a to get away with that one so here is Corin at the line 62 free throw shooter for the young man from Allen Texas and the first one good in Florida State on the board first here Cameron Corin averaging eight and a half points and four rebounds in conference play had four points seven rebounds Saturday night in the loss at Clemson hes had eight or more though Cory picked up his scoring here as conference play comes to its final turn eight or more in six of the last seven yeah OB forgive me WD last on one night removed last time against NC State a season to go cam corn had 16 and six also with five offensive rebounds against Clemson in their last game so hes playing his best basketball the season Morel to find a pass and NC State still scoreless heres warley Junior from Philadelphia its 67 soft floater good Taylor Worley on the board but this is the area for Florida State once they score do they have that pressure picked up 94 ft trying to find ways to create opportunities this is a team thats second in the ACC in steals and first en forcing turnovers and they need those to thrive offensively DJ horn working against get Miller and Horn will drive all the way scoop it with a right hand and DJ horn on the board second best scorer in conference played almost 20 a night yeah DJ Horns not just a shooter hes a scorer you mentioned the numbers hes a young man that can fill it up quickly had a kind of pedestrian game for him last time out burns the block of the Miller Drive uhoh heres Morel ahead for horn who squeezes the trigger through traffic hes got four Miller was slow to get up yeah thats what was concerning when I watched Baba Miller struggle to get up and get back defensively Burns is impacting the game at the defensive end here Watkins around morel and it drops in tough shot good result for jir Watkins Coury yeah thats great offense beating really good defense by Casey morsel forced jir Watkins into a tough look but able to finish over the tough defense NC States already got Ben Middlebrooks at the table wol pack trailing by a point here is horn whos got two quick buckets seven to shoot oconnell Wolfpack still way out on the perimeter offensively with three heres burns the catch with one on the clock put it up no shot clock violation and Lee Cassel and theyre going to go go I going to check this I think they are yeah Pat Adams felt like he had a pretty good look on it knowing that it was in still in the hands of DJ burs before he let it go but Lee Cel of course you can always stop playing go checking on a made field goal as we look but Pat Adams I believe had it correct it was still in the hands of DJ Burns yep I dont believe that baskets going to count it shouldnt take very long either but I love the fact that they went to look at it you dont want to second guess that later it is a shot clock violation Le cell announcing that Pat was very confident in his call from the beginning yep good crew tonight now very good crew its like one of those Elite eight final four crews well I mean you know which me and you here I mean they got to bring the best thats what we were thats all we could expect correct Im just glad we got the invitation pressure in the back court no surprise from keatss Team Inc State opponent shooting just 437 theyre the sixth best defensive team against field goal shooting in the conference during league play and Middlebrooks forced a tough shot there last touched by the Wolfpack itll stay with the Noles and 17 to shoot that was miscommunication on the screen defense right there theres supposed to be a switch however Casey morcel does switch but and you see immediately that okono comes out of the game because he was the guy that did not communicate on the switch and gave jir Watkins an early opportunity fortunately NC State B was unable to take care of it Jaden Taylor checks into the ball game hes been terrific Off the Bench for Kevin Keats inside Corin with the right hand and it got tapped again I think theyre going to award it to Miller but youre thinking di was the one who tapped it in I dont know that I thought that uh I thought Miller might have tapped it in yeah no miller was over there they award it to Corin that shouldnt go to Corin it would that had to be a a tip in it seemed as though that one came off the basket unless Baba Miller didnt touch it we might have to go back to a video review on that we could definitely have to see that one theres moreell but see you know what Baba also didnt sell it Taylor step in two Jaden Taylor averaging 10 a half against the league with his first point and Taylor who started the first 24 games for in State now coming off the bench the last four and a three ball from Darren Green Jr 60th three of the year with a senior transfer from Charlotte yeah and this is a game when youre Darren Green Jr and youre playing against a North Carolina team that didnt recruit you you always have a little extra motivation going on out of the corner horn to answer cannot diara whos a terrific rebounder the stick back but you see diara as soon as he gets the second chance points hes on the ball look at this go back and forth again there goes Watkins for his second field goal Cory WD we talked about the pace the tempo of this game we know both these teams want to get up and down and try to beat the opposing team down the floor before theyre able to set their defense middle Brooks heres Taylor M Corin on the switch they felt pretty comfortable in their workout today about their ability to switch one through five here Cory yeah and one of the things we talked with Kevin Keat about is simply when when you do get those switches you still have to be able to drive and kick terrific move morcel couldnt finish Green in the NS with a fourpoint lead early got to pick him up early hes ready to fire as soon as he crosses half court Darren Green deciding not to look at the three ball after he already knocked down one theres Worley on the drive midle Brooks clear so your thinking is NC State slows at all it allows Florida State then to stand in defensively well this is an example right here when youre horn you got to drive that create opportunity for yourself or teammate that one Casey morcel not ready to shoot it the r was and knocks down the three and what did Kevin Keys tell us before when he makes threes it changes everything for them offensively those driving lanes open up and he often plays better once he sees the ball go in from Beyond The Arc diara has really helped NC State since moving into the starting lineup and thats going to be a foul on Corin against Middlebrooks then Middlebrooks holding his post defensively foul on Corin our first timeout tonight for Florida State a moment ago we had an alleged basket by Cameron Corin but you see the great teamwork between those two guys if Im B by Miller Im not hugging cam corn he got my basket right there or for the official scoring right now Cameron K one of two Baba Miller 0 for two from the field but that you can see was they got to change that they they need to change that that was a bucket for Baba Miller however Baba is such a team player he doesnt care hes you scored that basket you to run to half court with a hand and KN both hands up WD pointing to the score table thats mine make sure you give me my bucket all right so Florida State who is 8 seven at home but level par in the ACC at 44 the nlls who only shot 37 and hit just four threes the other night the loss at Clemson have an early lead and we get our first look at Primo Spears Off the Bench he wears 23 for Florida State and theres jayen gainy also on the floor is Chandler Jackson and Taylor B Bowen its almost like a full line change for Leonard Hamilton well you can see that often here in Tallahassee because of course coach ham will play 11 guys maybe even 12 middle Brooks the roll for his first basket Cory and another shot at the shot clock buzzer that time middle Brooks was able to get it off in time but Florida State defending for all 30 seconds Chandler Jackson who didnt score in 17 minutes the other night at Clemson on the board quickly but Chandler Jackson had a big time performance in his start without Darren Green he was in a starting lineup and had 19 points versus Boston College in the last win here for the no that got kicked out off the Miss heres Taylor launching and no good but a foul is going to be called on gainy contesting the triple by Jaden Taylor now this is how you do not contest a shot WD this is not going to happen swinging across your body trying to block a shot there fouling is inevitable from that one and when youre talking about a guy who was an Ivy League Defensive Player of the Year thats just a defensive mental breakdown from gy on that possession recognizing he needs to come out with his left hand up trying to contest that shot but so he can go straight up and down not fouling Taylors got three here after the Miss I can tell you hes an Josh nry Josh nickelberry into the lineup Watkins takes a break nickelberry who was recruited heavily by this Florida State seol coaching staff coming out of high school he actually spent part of his junior year with me at oakill Academy WB he overcame that and has worked his way into you know what ended up becoming a good player anyway of course his Uncle Kevin on the bench at Florida State yep turned over by the nlls Taylor only got one of the three free throws heres oconnell and pass offline heres the turnover and this is Jackson back for Spears nice feed gy the dunk great find by Primo Spears getting into the teeth of the defense however staying poised Under Pressure dropping it off forain for the easy dunp NOS return to the lead game is so Highwire its a little erratic at times in the half court oconnell missing the three NOS collect and heres Jackson again and nobody stopping the ball hell Lo B boing the catch inside hell score The Freshman from Vermont on the board interesting that tandler Jackson was looking to pass that basketball no one ever stopped him made a difficult pass but B Bowen able to catch and finish but that was could have been a layup for Cham Jackson yep heres OK Connell trying to find a seam inside gy shut him down tend to shoot with Dennis Parker Jr on the drive that got blocked heres Jackson again leading the transition and they still hav it stopped them hell push it up and in Chandler Jackson the sophomore from Memphis and Kevin Keats right now has to be disappointed with his team stopping the basketball in transition it seems as though theyre scared of Shooters everyones running away from the most dangerous Guy the one who has the ball in his hand middle Brooks now to Parker and here is Taylor in the Applause quarter Applause last corner corner Reese Chris thanks very much we welcome you to Tallahassee tonight with Cory Alexander West Durham Florida State and NC State their only meeting of the regular season and the NS have gotten a spark from their bench and have a threepoint lead as weve reached almost the Midway point of this first half Cory and the NOS have been getting out in transition theyve been scoring before the Wolfpack can get back and get their defense set but these are two high octane teams Taylor had it blocked by gainy Middlebrooks on the stick back and he draws the foul itll be on Jackson whos got four points for Coach Hamilton third foul on the NOS free throws when we come back to Florida state Florida state with a threepoint Advantage youre watching the ACC tonight on ESPN here at the Tucker Center in Tallahassee Cory we expected this game at 94 ft High possession game lots of Threes early on the two schools are three of seven from three theyre shooting it okay Leonard Hamiltons pressur defense kind of setting in it feels like in the half quarter especially well Florida State shooting it very well nine of 16 from the field they havent shot the three great but when you think about it theyve only taken two attempts theyve been getting everything in the painted area already 14 points in the paint for Florida State and but a lot of thats come in transition where North Carolina state has not stopped the basketball at the point of attack and forced them to have to give it up or do anything different tler Jackson had a number of opportunities alone where hes got into the painted area scored or assisted by the way that reserve unit that came on the floor for Coach ham stays out there which they they should yeah they were the team that really you know built the lead now its only a onepoint game but as we see North Carolina State picking up but once again no one stopping the basketball there goes nickel bear Josh nickel bear grad transfer started his career as Cory told you at Louisville then Lal now here at Florida State on the board by the way his dad was a big time college football player at Northern Illinois Cory linebacker I knew that I know its po well like a nameer good linebacker heres horn Burns back for horn and the three is good DJ horn seven of NC States 22 and thats the way the world pack have been able to stay into it theyve now made three threepoint field goals so theyve been the better shooting team from Beyond The Arc even though Florida St shoted a higher percentage Deontay green working against DJ burns with the right hand and the rebound for Applause Taylor horn will do a lot of the ball handling with this particular lineup on the floor with in state but that was a unnecessary NE switch between Spears and Taylor Bowen now not that Bowen cant defend the position but you must prefer to have Spears guarding a guy like DJ hor heres Morel thats an offensive foul Ching Morel his first second on the wolf so heres the thing whenever youre pressing and someone gives the basketball up somebodys got to take care of the basketball stop the basketball first but on the other end of the floor DJ horn has felt great about things this young man WD until the last game where they won convincing over Boston College he had seven straight games where he made three or more threepoint fi he is shooting the basketball ex with extreme confidence right now Cory I had had six in a row I think of what 24 or more 24 25 points yeah or more yes yeah I mean not he was on the verge of like not since JJ reedit type ACC oh thats a name yeah I mean literally thats where it was just an amazing Music run there is green but you see NC State switching defensively at the top of the keeps position wise green was unable to last possession trying to back down DJ Burns this time faces him up and gets the bucket yep heres hor with a quick pass now for DJ Burns now this is where you have to decide are you going to double team and a foul be called on Deontay green against Burns thats the challenge WD when youre playing against NC State do you double team DJ Burns or do you allow him to play oneonone he is an elite level scorer one to one oneonone under the basket however his passing may be even more Elite yeah the the passing Acumen of one DJ Burns does not go unnoticed in the conference scouting reports and he loves to talk about hell tell you about his passing he welcomes the double team heres horn trying to beat Watkins kick back with eight to shoot this is Brion pass another guard Off the Bench of Kevin Keats and heres Burns again with green look at this B away as the shot clock winds down Miller the rebound NOS with a twopoint lead green a deep three sure WD thats why I was so surprised that Darren Green didnt shoot the three on a previous possession after he just made one hes always locked and loaded youre talking about a young man thats made over 153s in the last two seasons for Florida State morels first basket tonight pulls the pack back to within three Deontay green and this is Darren Green Jr and Deontay tes up a three and HS thats his third three of the Year Cory backto back threes by Florida State we mentioned earlier with NC State shooting the basketball the way that they were that was what kept them in the game but if Florida state gets involved in that mix that gives them make great chance here on their home floor at the Tucker Center Leonard Hamilton season number 22 of a magical 36year career for the uh guest North Carolina native yeah fifth alltime winning as coach in ACC history and one of the best to do it when you consider coach ham now 22 years in WD hed already had a tremendous resume before he even taken this job absolutely of course 144 wins at Miami 56 at Oklahoma State and a turnover by NC State puts Watkins and the nlls in transition oh my goodness morcel got a piece of the green three but Watkins cleaned it up third field goal for jir Watkins we also cant forget the wins for the Washington Wizards for Coach H thats right NBA coach for a season Music so Brion pass remember the two guard lineup now back heres more cell Line Drive Middle Brooks trying to clean it up raped out of bounds I think last touch warley in the NOS thatll bring Corin back into the lineup nice job defense coming up with the deflection Darren Green trying to get the three on transition but case Morel does a great job blocking the shot J Watkins Johnny on the spot right there picking it up and laying it in to add to the lead extending to eight for the N biggest lead of the ball game for Florida State Miller the rebound of the wolf pack miss here is green again boy hes ready take a quick look heres Corin working on middle Brooks thats going to be a block by Pat Adams on Ben Middlebrooks and I like that call but I understand the attempt by Ben Middlebrooks to try to take the charge because of course Cameron corn is coming with a lot of force but you normally get that call on the second bump and you see middle Brooks actually delivering the throw on the first one on that second opportunity getting called for the foul Worley eight to shoot in Florida State some 20 odd feet out green trying to find a valve turns launches and hits thats the second time in this game that Casey morcel has played excellent defense but youve had someone knocked down a shot Darren Green with great defense coming up with the steal unable to turn it into points off the turnover however Florida state will keep it the NOS just antagonizing NC State into some unforced errors well and the pace that Florida States playing with when they score of course theyre picking up 94 ft Darren Green able to steal the inbounds pass on the last possession and even though hes unable to make the shot the pace of play going so fast Bon pass unable to handle the rebound and keep possession for the Wolfpack seven straight for the NOS its a 12 two run heres Watkins now 11 to shoot against horn and hes got to take it advantage of his size get as far as down as he can and got stripped of it on the way up Morel with the takeaway hell try and beat Florida State to the basket and Watkins recovers Casey wanted to foul didnt get it Middlebrooks deflects the lead pass what a save by Middlebrooks got to make this three Taylor for three and the rebound Miller you got to make that one just the reward B Middlebrooks with that hustle and the nulls will throw it away Millers lead for Corin too high and too far for even cam Corin at 610 to flag it down diara trying to put the ball in play and the nulls pressure in the back court especially Spears Mara States created this advantage in part because of the way they played defensively and Horn knocks three off the measure with a triple hes got now 10 in the first half but WD you can only help so far off of DJ horn and I understand Primo Spears being in help staying in the gaps however when You got DJ horn as your assignment youve got to make sure that that help is a much shorter cover Miller backing down on Taylor here Baba in traffic with the right hand to his game thats his first basket that we can record officially here in this first half right he should have too he should but well bring it up at half time Miller has uh Miller has done a terrific job just in his Player Development individually feels like is a sophomore theres morcel sneaking Baseline terrific move Casey morcel Casey morcel has had a pretty good outing here thus far Kevin ke was KS was encouraged by his last game he and DJ Burns both against Boston College both those guys really getting involved offensively and defensively as well and they win Baseline Spear and did he step out of bounds he did a turnover at the under four Mark gets us to a timeout its a seven lead for Florida State Wolfpack cutting into the margin no surprise its DJ horn dialing three hes got 10 in this opening half we play on from Tallahassee next bless your heart Mr farum bless your heart were looking forward to everybody being able to see that on acc Network work tomorrow night the debut of uh Rivals reunited yes sir yeah Im definitely tuning in to check that one L WD o Connell and with horn morcel diara and burns original starters now for NC State here in the final three and a half I think everybody will get something tomorrow night from Coach K and uh coach Williams in our 1hour visit that follows by the way Louisville Duke on acc Network heres morcel on the drive boy what a tough shot Casey morcel has been attacking the basket now his third field goal and all inside the paint and strong in attack mode and Kevin Keys told us earlier today hey we we got good production out of him last time out against Boston College were hoping to be a to pick up on that momentum and a foul foul heres Morel who by the way he not done just a good job scoring Cory hes done a good job handing out hes got three assists yeah going to the left hand off the glass able to finish but not being deterred by the physical contact going downhill and able to finish over the top second foul though with 301 to play here first piece of foul trouble for the wolf pack just 14 fouls though on state as we wind down the final three here in Tallahassee Sean and D were talking about a night in the ACC where some of the teams in the middle of the stack are kind of making sure that they can keep their position certainly win tonight by Clemson win tonight by Syracuse and this game also Cory Falls in that category theres a foul I believe theyre going to tick it Baba Miller thatll be his first five on Florida State also Wake Forest visiting not to Dame yep and trying to follow up often difficult to follow up after you have a big win like wake for had at against Duke on Saturday how do you respond especially the next time out on the road my young guy Eric dindorf on the call AC Network on that about tonight three ball from out on the right no good a Burns foul as Applause he kind of put a hand on cam Corin underneath on the offensive chance so the foul on DJ Burns will be his second thats five on the pack with 229 to play weight Forest now the deacons 10 six playing tonight Virginia 11 six Cavaliers of course and then you got Duke at 12 four North Carolina 14 and three after the win last night over Miami we got a little bit of a we got a little bit of a jam on our hands here in the last 10 days dont we we absolutely do and that jam is what number of different reasons one is about the top four ses to get that double by in the ACC tournament and then also so youre talking about a number of teams who are still playing for their you know NCAA tournament chances I hate listening to people talk about oh now theyre in no theyre not you still have to finish the season no one is in as of yet and so many things are going to change between now and marks the what is it 13 14 15 16 17 there you go y I knew it was one of those KS yes it is well done heres the drive that Spears and hell draw the foul its on Taylor itll be his first it is six now on the Wolfpack and Primo Spears from Hartford will go to the line Primo Spears attacking great job actually staying vertical by Taylor on that one it was Primo Spears that created the contact however in that area thats normally going to be a foul first one from Spears is good dont forget two of the top teams in the Big 12 12 square off Saturday ABC your home at 100 number seven Kansas number 15 Baylor 100 Eastern noon Central and Spears 3731 game after he got one of two and cam Woods is into the lineup Cory first time hes played in the last six games and cam Woods is if hes able to get into double figures WD he would be the 11 seventh player for the wolf pack to have scored a double figure game this season which would be amazing when you think about the numbers yeah its normally Florida State we take about that plays that many guys that can go out there and be productive however Kevin Keats has that same level of rotation in R how about 11 different guys have scored how about the whole crew looking for Kevin ke airpods and shoot around this morning he came to talk to us and dropped his airod next thing you knew we had the entire staff over here but but they didnt they werent doing it because they were trying to help coach Kei out like a federal mission was conducted right once they find him he actually has to pay to get his property back thats a rule they have with in the staff because theyve had guys losing so much stuff theyve actually made a game up tra in the corner here nickelberry B Bowen out of it to diara with 11 to shoot and under a minute and a half to play sixpoint lead for the nlls Taylor trying to beat nickelberry baseline Up and Under draws the foul Two Shots coming on the seventh against Florida State the guards have attacked the basket very strong for NC State weve seen Casey Morel get to the rim and have success this time Taylor will go to the free throw line but he went with mean intentions on that one avoiding the contact but still takes a hit upside the head Jaden Taylor hit only one of three when he was fouled earlier in the half on a threepointer and the free throw there gives him his seventh point of the first half off the bench Cory kind of been his thing averaging a dozen point you doubled your scoring and shoot it almost 15 full per better thats a pretty good feel isnt it yeah it is I mean when you think about it only one player FC State started every game this season thats Casey Morel so theyve had a number of different lineup seven to be exact so coach keiths trying to figure out whats the best rotation and whats the best way to play all this tal there goes Watkins on the drive and that breaks a threeminute drought from the floor eight now for jir Watkins and thats one guy for certain Leonard Hamilton is going to get as many minutes as he possibly can because he is super productive during his time on the court sixpoint lead for Florida State heres Taylor diara launching a deep three from the left middle Brooks to contest touched it last itll belong to Florida state with about a 14 1 12 differential shot clock to game clock as we wind down the first half and a timeout Leonard Hamilton going to take the use it or lose it 30 here well step aside sixpoint lead for the nlls trying to find their ninth win in the a well Kevin Keats 51yearold native of Lynchburg Virginia now in season number seven in Raleigh and of course two times the CAA coach of the year for the Seahawks at UNCC Wilmington before coming to Raleigh and Cory they come in here tonight 9 and seven in the league theyre 17 10 overall their net is 77 but theyve got including tonight three quad ones and a quad two in the offense opportunities available for Kevin KS and the Wolf Pack to make a strong long stand and a case for themselves to get into the NCAA tournament as Primo Spears gets to the midrange knocks it down NC State will try to keep for the last shot here going into the halftime locker room Spears has got three the lead back to eight and theres a timeout for NC State so the pack take their use it or lose at 30 here with 20 seconds left so well step aside lead back to eight for Florida State as we wind down this first half State 20 seconds to go Kevin ke used the timeout here for his last possession and what we were talking about previously you can see the remaining schedule for the wolf pack Saturday at North Carolina right Monday home vers the Duke Blue Devils and then on the road at Pittsburgh March the 9th so these are three great opportunities a quad two opportunity for them tonight but then two three straight quad one opportunities for them afterwards season Spears is checking DJ horn here and NC State kind of goes with a 1 14 look here 7 Seconds to go horn trying to work on Spears he gets by him hell put it high on the glass diara tried to come down with it in the half in Florida States going to take the eightpoint advantage to the locker room here Cory Florida stage won five consecutive games in this building versus NC State great start for Leonard Hamilton and his staff in the first half wolf pack Trail by eight off to D cuff and sha farum well you know Cory you head into the final turn of start the second half until he daps you up thats my young fell man thats my guy of course hes walking right over to the table he got to come dap me up is he a takeover guy too he is absolutely a team take guy so that that explains it all yes and you cant forget he was a wahoo actually at one point w its been tell you something NC State almost turned it over on the first possession look at diara recover the Loose Change couldnt finish the layup and here go the NS Darren Green by the way took a spill on the Baseline hes still down as Miller gets all the way to the basket for his second field goal and thats inexcusable for the simple fact that Florida state scored in transition four on five right we mentioned Darren Green never got back as Casey morcel attacks the basket strong once again and that foul is on Corin thats his second thatll be the first of the half on the NOS these two teams in the first half Cory were a total seven of 11 at the free throw line I expect that number to be at least double here in the second half in terms of free throw attempts agreed especially when youve got Casey morcel attacking the basket the way that he has of course has the reputation of a shooter but you see hes put the work in on his body and a young man that can absorb the contact when he gets to the rim 83 at the line in conference play morcel now with seven heres Chandler Jackson you saw Darren we told you Darren Green took a little spill at the Baseline on that first exchange so he will come out and he is slow to get back to the bench area but I tell you what I love even more so was Kevin Keats actually going over to Darren Green checking on him making sure he was okay as hes checking out the game and mutual respect between both Morel one or two look at Baba Miller work all the way into traffic finds and the Miss offensive rebound though in Miller and Florida State with a second chance here is Watkins deflected by horn so jir Watkins will put it in play as Florida State keeps possession with 10 to shoot n npoint game its been as big as a dozen in the first half for the no or 10 Becky Parton at 3424 on the drive the scoop and the score and Chandler Jackson who had 19 as you mentioned in the first half Cory against Boston College has got a very impressive six here early in the second half but its been too easy for Florida State on the offensive end attacking the baskets theres no resistance and more importantly theres no one in the Gap to keep away those driving LS largest lead of the night for the NS Morel trying to shoot State back in and does and thats what happens when you make some layups and you see The Confidence from the free throw line now all of a sudden Casey morcel knocking it down from Beyond the threepoint Arc consecutive double figure kns now for Morel hes got 10 after 13 in Saturdays win against Boston College Watkins heres Worley quick bounce pass catch and score for cam Cory five for Cory B state has dominated the paint they did it in the first half and they started out that way here in the second half as well getting anything they want in the painted area Bing a long three he air ball against the block attempt of Baba Applause Miller look look at this here heres the morcel three Corin then responded at the other end for Florida State on a nice pass from waren and and I guess Miller did get a piece of it yeah I believe Baba did get a piece of that one into diara back toward the Baseline a reroute to the middle put it up got it blocked and were going to get a foul called on Corin I believe P Driscoll on the last call he was the one who was emphatic about the fact that Baba Miller did get a hand on that shot foul went to Watkins Cory it was his first second on Florida State fresh 20 heres horn on a pull up thats great job defensively by warley not allowing horn to make the contact warley the L and the dunk for Corin WD always love to watch a young fell look inside the rim that time cam corn went way up high he could see if the rim was Dusty or not WD no question check out the smudges on the glass while hes at it Morel to answer and du confident right now you seeing the confidence from Casey Morel and lets you know call it what it is its coming to the end for Casey Morel theres a different level of urgency this is his fifth year in college basketball his last and he understands how important each and every one of these games are Miller the Miss on the three ninepoint lead for Florida State were 3 minutes into the half two see thats the thing WD you know thats he check time Id say hell spot thats a two and its good okay still a heat check just midrange Morel has nine here in the second half all nine of NC States points Cory you know what Im going to chalk it up to right yeah coming over here and slapping your hand to start the half I just gave him the touch oh my Jackson you got to be kidding me heres horn on the lead oh hes open get cing the ball heres and Horn will try and help yeah never mind D call off the would be effort of morcel who apparently has been impacted by the touch cant believe we went there but just like that a fourpoint game yep Florida State now having to deal with the pressure and often times being sped up another opportunity where they sped up cam Corin trying to go oneonone against DJ burns on the backside of the pressure Burns wins that battle even though Florida state will keep the basketball well were going to get Florida State to put the ball in play look at this now look at 30 just hold his spot in the road and you know what the best part about that is hes outside of the restricted area if hes in the restricted area he has to jump otherwise thats a foul but he keeps his feet outside of that restricted area stays with the nose Miller against diara Bo a Miller what a turn and score Cory yeah that that wasnt even going over the top that was going around for a baba Miller who does not like to be referred to as 7 foot so he often goes by 612 horn lead back to six tough assignment for Worley huh it absolutely is that guy can get heated up quickly he up how about this Casey Morel now has got 11 and a half 17 in the ball game hes got a different sense of urgency here to start this second half but Casey gel started the game off strong but this second half has been special two off is ACC high and that ball got knocked away last touched and thatll get us to a break well we walked ourselves from a eightpoint halftime lead to now Florida State by four we play on from Tallahassee next WoW Mark Pope walked in there like it was just another day at the office tonight Lawrence huh absolutely did huge win for BYU and going to be interesting to see how that affects Kansas as far as the Bracketology is concerned do they now fall to the three line in comparison to being a two its interesting to see how WD throughout the other conferences outside of ACC when wins like that have taken place how it doesnt affect other teams the same way it does AC jir Watkins buries a deep three hes got 11 well it you know what Cory it invites a conversation I think about the way November and December are structured and regarded as opposed to what happens January February and into early March however the goal line keeps getting moved it does because for the last two seasons all the talk was that the ACC didnt do what it needed to do in the nonconference thats right however this year the accs 9 and3 versus the big 12 yep they go 7 s versus the SEC but yet now its about conference play for the ACC so the goal line continues to be moved as Chandler Jackson continues to play great basketball getting to The Rim finishing and its been the story of the game for Florida State NC State hasnt had any answer for the semal when theyre getting downhill attacking the basket this time Chandler Jackson able to finish through the contact to hoop the harm and an opportunity for the am got this young guy from Memphis he trying to get to double figures for the third time in the last seven ball games made the free throw hes got nine off Leonard Hamiltons bench and Florida States pushed it back to an eightpoint advantage heres Jaden Taylor now with Taylor B Bowen defending and on the drive this is horn I do want to get your thought on something here though that weve had discussions about theres a drive and a foul thatll theyre going to get jayen gy second third on Florida State you mentioned the way the accs been regarded uhhuh it feels like that the position statement in all of college basketball but particularly so in this league is moving on the NCAA evaluation tool as well heres Taylor a triple and thats good 11 now for Jaden Taylor thats been the Saving Grace for the wolf pack theyve shot the three extremely well throughout this game and thats the way theyve stayed into it thats been the battle for NC State because Florida States done it all getting into the painted area theres a hand check foul on the perimeter and thats Ernest Ross who played briefly in the first half we talked about Taylor and his ability to shoot the basketball but more importantly his production coming off the bench as he checks into the game lines up at three knocks it down from Beyond The Arc and Taylor now with in double figures with 11 points and Jackson gy battle for the miss last Touch by the wolfb by the way the Taylor field goal was because Casey Morel shared his career high fourth assist is that because he also had the touch at half time listen average 195 and four WD so I mean again they should be those numbers should be legit for Casey MO legit or his legit I mean again I gave him the touch 195 and4 my sophomore year I mean you know so I mean Im sure he can at least achieve that here there a follow Away by Watkins he played much better defense than I ever met and B Bowen no question there on all fronts theres a step back three and look at Primo Spears dial up long distance and if Florida state is doing that theyre so difficult to beat especially here in this building when theyre making threes because theyve gotten everything theyve attacking the paint lead is eight with 13 to play horn against B Bowen freshman from Vermont who played at Brewster Academy a year ago theres horn got him in the air couldnt pull the trigger six to shoot from Middlebrooks hell drive and score nice take by Ben Middlebrooks really just a stem the tide right there you can see Florida State picking up the effort defensively Ben Middlebrooks not deterred by getting downhill the nephew of the former Florida State quarterback Danny canel with the field goal and theres Corin at the other end for the nlls now theyre starting to get it to 94 ft here in the second half they absolutely are the pace of this game is exactly the way both these teams want to play theyd love to see a game in the 80s maybe even 90s y horn against B Bowen look at the pullup jumper there diara kept it alive to Taylor and thats what diara does best Keep Second Chance opportunities alive for his team coming up with offensive rebound Taylor gets rid of it out of traffic tend to shoot with morcel who wants a screen oh nice slip diara the dunk thats now five assists for Casey right it is so when I said 195 the five was assist four rebounds we got to he got to get two more points at least is that for you I mean G the touch the touch talk about the touch yeah I cant wait to see the flock of guys that come over to see you in Washington at the tournament my Heavens were going to get a break thank goodness here Cor reexamine the touch meanwhile Primo Spears how about a look here for Corin inside NOS it pushed it to a sixpoint lead in Tallahassee tonight to start off day two tell you what those uh those earlier games tonight Syracuses win against Virginia Tech Clemsons win it home against pit Lo pretty large in terms of the way the middle of the standings and of course Wake Forest at Notre Dame at this hour and theres a foul I believe on Taylor thatll be his second thats the third as we go to the Metropolitan Washington area for the sixth time in ACC tournament history two weeks from today well be underway at uh Capital One Arena of course the wolf pack right now in the seventh spot mhm however if this game does not go in their Direction they would then have identical records with Florida state so they would flip spots most likely correct correct cuz Florida state will have won the headtohead got some interesting headtohead games coming down the stretch in the ACC heres a three ball Spears boy rattled out on kind of a heap in Hope ell diara go back down Spears Work Baseline got in traffic and almost turned it over Spears couldnt collect before it ran right into the hands of NC State assistant Steve Snell across the way so it will stay with the Wolfpack and I think theres a little bit of a question here on possession and a reset what should be on the shot clock thats the biggest concern Le Cel Pat Adams talking it out did Florida State actually have possession of the basketball which would make it a so they reset to 20 seconds Deonte green has checked in for Coach Hamilton and everybody is set so Connell and Horn with Jaden Taylor here heres middle Brooks on the drive and blocked out of there by B Bowen but thats why you can trust your switches for Leonard Hamilton when you have guys like Taylor B Bowen that can guard get in a stance and more importantly make up for the quickness advantage that DJ horn has with your length and your shot blocking ability thats why he trusts his guys to be able to go out and switch one through five when you know you can guard like that middle Brooks in traffic State bench wanted a foul didnt get it in transition green against diara scores and B Bowen doing it all another block shot for him and then cring the rebound on his own leading the break dropping the dime to Deonte green and almost stole it but Pat Adams has called a foul on the Freshman Taylor B Bowen young man who was born in Egypt in a refugee camp arrived in the United States adopted by the Bowens in Vermont he played it Academy a year ago and 610 there is a lot of length and a lot of potential with this young man and hes the type of player that can flourish in Florida State system being able to switch defensively guarding multiple players and you see has the offensive ability to be able to rebound and push the basketball and transition to make it play as well and you see the height of this team and to be honest WD this is a short lter Hamilton compared to most yes thatll rim off and middle Brooks will draw the foul I think Deontay green picked that up and indeed he did yeah there have been uh times where the nulls made s ft look normal exactly three and four sevenfooters on the rotation to go along with the 5610 guys so and then the guards for Florida State have normally been 64 and up yep Primo Spears one of the smaller yards that Leonard Hamilton has had in the fold however hes been very effective a double figure scorer and getting a lot of minutes especially as of late for Leonard Hamilton couple of free throws for Middle Brooks first one good dont forget terrific college basketball Saturday coming up on ESPN Cory and Dave OBrien will be at Smith Center in Chapel Hill for State Carolina thats all you need to say and then the short drive down 15501 Virginia and Duke at six and then Saturday night in Prime Time number five Tennessee number 14 1 Alabama and Coleman Coliseum and Tuscaloosa on ESPN and always available on the ESPN app you know WD as we talk about and we keep talking Bracketology and you think about the fact that Kansas losing at home to BYU BYU is a good team yep that is not a I mean again its a loss at home which for Kansas I say upset however its not a bad loss because BYU is a good team Pittsburgh was beaten at home by three good teams North Carolina yep Duke Syracuse yep I wonder if Kansas will be penalized with same way that Pittsburgh has been again it just makes those things that make you say when you think about what the bracketologist think about because the same Pittsburgh team went to West Virginia and got a win when Kansas was unable to win there thats correct so you know these are the type of things I think about as a ACC guy when I look at what bracki says about our conference see Primo Spears little spot up jumper Spears got eight now off coach Hamiltons bench the foul on Miller a moment ago his second Cory I think the the question also becomes and I think theres a lot of rhetoric about the way the committee is going to handle this particular bracket theres diara finally cleaning it up inside and hell get a foul and a chance to add one more and thats another foul de on Deontay green his third and and that is seven on Florida State now so here go the free throws with n and 1 half to play well and you mentioned earlier about Muhammad diara and his ability to offensive rebound how he keeps possessions alive and Kevin Keat told us if you see him make a three hes normally going to have a much better game we watched him make a three in the first half hes one for two from Beyond a threepoint AR but weve seen his energy at its highest level throughout this entire game after he got going offensively Five Points early for the y hes got a chance now for his 10th point and the free throw is no good itll bounce out look at that he got cared around morcel to Taylor Jaden could get through on the reroute oh what a three here would do for the Wolfpack huh and midd Brook threw it away tried to read it for diara and middle Brooks knew he was in trouble a minute he Cutting Loose Cory he absolutely did and Di actually stopped and did not keep running to the basketball di actually reached out Pat Middlebrooks on the chest and told him thats my bad now well get back a dead ball turnover so they can set their defense Spears out front green going to shoot for three and Di the rebound thats his seventh of the night to go with the nine points heres horn middle Brooks one dribble up strong missed it draws the foul Lee Cassel is going to ticket Miller thats three on Baba Miller eight on Florida State with just under nine to go here but you see how now NC State is taking a page out of the book of what Florida state has done all day they are attacking the paint you see Ben Middlebrooks not kicking that out and thats a good call you see Baba Miller lean into Ben Middlebrooks as hes shooting the basketball even though his arms are outstretched if you lean in with the body that contact throws him off balance middle Brooks unable to take advantage of the free throw and here comes Watkins back into the order to replace Miller with the three fouls Florida State partisans and simal bench not exactly thrilled with the whistle on Miller so Middlebrooks will have a chance here Ben transferred within the conference from Clemson to NC State he announced his transfer Within 45 minutes of the same transfer from NC State to Clemson of Jack Clark on the same day within the same hour and it almost looked like Cory that it was a trade back me last April with nil now and the portal is pretty much free agency so I jokingly told some people the conference never sent out a release ratifying the trade but for all intents and purposes we had the first trade Ive joked with both Brad Brownell and Kevin Keats about other conditions of the trade and havent really gotten any kind of answer on if theres any other particles to it but nonetheless middle Brooks got the back end and the game is five points but I will say this the trade has worked out for both players it has Ben Middlebrooks has been a great its been a great contributor to NC State this year you see him getting quality minutes in the second half and then you think about Zack th now the starting lineup yep for the Clemson to Taylor for three oh my goodness thats confidence right there oneonone on the break off the steel and pulling up for three to make it a twopoint game and diara going to be whistled for the foul in transition mohamd diara thats his first that is five now on the wol pack and Taylor getting out doesnt handle the basketball cleanly but Primo Spears getting back trying to protect the basket Taylor recognizing that pulls up but how about the NC State bench everyone up encouraging their teammates thats what you love to see the most especially on the road guys arent concerned about their own theyre concerned about a win and this is a team that weve talked about theyre also in the mix to be one of the teams considered to get an at large bid if they dont win the ACC Turner here is Spears fighting for a spot on the Baseline and scor tough Primo Spears has hit some tough shots has he he absolutely has in WD looking at his numbers his freshman year he had a he had a career high of 34 softball year career high 37 so this is a guy that can score The Rock he was honored the pregame with Coach Hamilton getting a basketball I believe that was for his 1000 Point thats it here is Spears again foul on jumper away and middle Brooks pulls it down fourpoint gain been as big as a 12point lead for Florida State NC State Leed only briefly tonight by one early in the game Taylor and Watkins at the table last Touch by the wol P says Lee celo to a time out and Primo Spears giving Florida State a little bit of breathing room going off the bounce is met for resistance however the turnaround jumper is good to make the lead four for the Music NOS well they say you dont miss much if you miss a lot guess what you miss this so going off the floor there was a trip inadvertently and now all of a sudden you got Primo Spears Cory and Steve Snell one of Kevin keatss assistants in exchange and we had alternate technical fouls called I dont mind it dont mind I dont mind it at all and the reason I dont mind it primo Spears taking up for his guy right but also coach nelton making up with his guy I dont mind it at all Pat Adams going over having a conversation with Primo Spears its over we move on but more importantly no harm you got the Tactical fouls they offet nobodys shooting we keep hooping I will add it is a personal foul on Spears mm it is a team foul on NC State which gives them six but thats nine on Florida State so the next one is two shots as you see worldly school but Florida State normally lives in the bonus they play so aggressively theyre a team that gets into the bonus Im not sure that coach ham is concerned about that the concern is how many fouls does primo Spears have does that put him in foul trouble and could that keep him from being aggressive as the game goes along lead is six as we work under seven to play morcel hit some big buckets to keep the wol pack Within Reach horn is been relatively quiet in the second half Five Points heres diara for three too strong missed everything Jackson the rebound he got pushed by oconnell Michael litigating that Chandler lost his balance instead OK connells first seven on the wolf pack so were going to have one and one at the other end I think and right now were going to actually go over and review Lee Cel just gave the sign he wanted to Applause see and so Pat Driscoll and Lee Cel at the monitor Im not certain as to what theyre looking for or is there was there anything extracurricular on this foul I didnt see it in live action I dont know theyre going to get much off of that shot clock violation before the foul okay so no foul there yeah there would be a shot clock violation before the foul the ball did not hit the rim so in in comparison to there being a foul on oconnell it would just be a shot clock violation and six fouls thatll stay on the Music Wolfpack I inadvertently had awarded the bonus on what was at least preliminarily called a foul as it is out of bounds on the Baseline wolf pack into the back court a little bit here too and that was only the first foul on Primo Spears so that would that technical foul will not put him in any Harms Way as far as being able to play the remaining 633 of this game right Worley again in traffic going to draw a foul now that is Applause s so itll be seven on the wolf pack Jaylen warley trying to take advantage of his 66 frame over Casey morcel as he gets close to the basket strong with the basketball and gets a shot up with the contact now gets him to the free throw line for two but the more important part about that Casey Morel now with his fourth foul and hes been the guy for NC State especially here in this second half so thats a costly foul for the Wolfpack heres the uh from Philadelphia warley at the line hes 71 on the year hes got four points tonight and the first one is good dont forget only a few games remain in womens basketballs terrific regular season Thursday Prime Time 700 on ESPN Liz kley Georgia Amore and Virginia Tech visit Hannah hgo and Notre Dame and then at 900 on ESPN 2 well send you to Athens Georgia where Bulldogs welome number nine LSU Thursday night on ESPN and ESPN 2 you know Im locked in WD and of course you know Im a Virginia Tech fan thats right but Hannah hadalo is is quietly becoming one of my favorites hes not Georgia abore yet horn misses the three what a a volleyball put back by middle Brooks hes got nine in the ball game and thats an area where NC State normally takes advantage they have 14 offensive rebounds in their win Saturday over Boston College and they have continued to crash the glass here on the offensive end as well Watkins against diara theyll take him on the drive up off the window and thats so tough jir Watkins just gets to the rim so strong and then just his pressure alone being on the basketball forces a turnover which of course Florida state is the best at in the AC CC yep another error by the wolf pack eightpoint game thatll get us to a break 540 to go eightpoint lead for the seminal at home tonight in Music Tallahassee well we said at the top it would be 94 ft its been that we said there would be a lot of lock down defense a lot of pressure defense a lot of Threes but this stat here tonight Florida State forcing 15 turnovers a game NC States committed 12 they only averaged nine Cory the margins for these two teams are really interesting Florida states third and turnover margin in conference play NC State is fourth well thats because Florida State forces so many turnovers because they not not necessarily A team that handles the basketball extremely well and another missed opportunity to score points off those turnovers the battle is 10 to 10 for these two teams but they for for so many turnovers that it makes their margin look good because theyre not the best ball handling team conell had it pushed into the back court by Watkins Michael oconnell tend to shoot heres morcel Casey triying to get by Watkins into traffic pushed it up front rim Miss with the right hand warley the Music rebound kick ahead for Spears for the dun corins now got 11 in the ball game on his fifth field goal great job as NC State runs it right back and diard gets the easy layup give oon a lot of credit 13 for diara Cory pushes the basketball after the highlight real dump for Cameron Corin anding for Florida State no way they should get beat back after that down the floor heres Watkins NC State whos got five comeback wins from double digits in the AC C second half double digit deficits now Trails 10 with 420 to play and a turnover Watkins teas it up itll rattle around and Dr clear but WD you can see right now Primo Spears is a Difference Maker for this Florida State Cham not only getting the midrange bucket to go but also coming up with the steel more cell all the way through and score ites 19 by the way just case you were count yeah I know youre well aware the touches helped your man tonight at this rate hell hug you next time he sees you it was Saturday in Chapel Hill hell see you I will see him there Dave OBrien better get ready to see a full Embrace between you and Casey Morel giving the away the second half work foul on oconnell Primo Spears making a difference for the nose here at the tuck driving it to the rim dishing it off to cam corn who knows how to finish here in front of the home fans Applause Music ESPNs exclusive coverage of college basketball is brought to you by Progressive Insurance bundle home and auto and save visit progressivecom great to be with Cory Alexander tonight Tucker Center in Tallahassee Luke bradick our producer Kirby ker our director and look at Florida States bench tonight Primos Spears who averages 103 points per game 12 points for him Chandler Jackson coming off the bench weve talked about how good hes been especially as of late in Deontay green 34 bench points from Florida State and this is normally an area where Kevin Keith group right is successful but its been about Florida States bench that has been the Difference Maker here to see eight fouls on the wolf pack with 345 to go 43 to go you see nine for Florida State possession Arrow belongs to the nulls and Spears tries to push this to 10 and does what a half for Primo Spears but how about the substitution right there you take out Primo Spears who is about 6 feet tall and you put in Baba Miller whos 6 12 and now thats the way you go about it Jaylen Wy going back to the point guard position with Spears on the bench but the way Spears is played Im pretty certain L Hamilton will get him back in to finish this game amazing how 612 just roll right off for you oh yeah well you remember kg was 613 hes not the first person weve seen do it heres Taylor now for morcel tend to shoot the air ball no reset morcel working on green Casey winding away and did not get the bounce and heres Watkins with the rebound and you cant settle if youre jir Watkins thats the exact right play attack youve got a smaller Defender waiting for you when you get back you got a strong body but of course extremely skilled for jir Watkins getting out in transition and he sees horn is the only defender in front of him there is going to be all gas no breaks as jir Watkins lets everyone know hes just too small to stop me Watkins will add the free throw 79 hes trying to join a list of very few players in the last 20 years to lead Florida State in points rebounds Steals and assist Cory at one point this year he one Five Guys in the country who led their team in points rebounds Steals and assist if you look at a list of ACC players I mean he would join a list that features guys like Aman Shumpert uh Anthony Grundy Darion SE by the way gravis Vasquez of Maryland its a heck of an accomplishment when youre a four category guy for a team agreed wholeheartedly and jir Watkins has been that valuable to this Florida State team throughout this season transferring in from BCU and is fit in automatically to Leonard Hamiltons style of play has become the leader on this team 12point lead for Florida State equals their biggest of the night Middlebrooks missed the first hits the second Baba Miller I believe picked up his fourth foul on that last possession but you get a chance to look at jir jir Watkins an all ACC candidate absolutely will be an all ACC performer the question is what team will he be on when the all ACC teams are announced Watkins thats going to be a 10 second 10 second yep horn had it the deflection orley had to chase it down the back court shot clock got to 20 theres the 10sec call and theres the sign Leonard Hamilton going right back to Primo Spears I had a feeling that would be the case and going to keep woy on the floor Darren Green Jor will will be the guy checking out of the lineup but thats the benefit of being there in Hamilton and having 11 and 12 guys you can rely on so many different lineups they can play to finish a game there goes Taylor hes fouled and thats going to be two shots 10 foul on Florida State with 251 to play NOS are in Atlanta on Saturday heres another look at the drive by Taylor second on walk Florida state will go to Atlanta to see Georgia Tech who has not played since they wi against Miami last Saturday at Coral GES and then they have a road trip for their only meeting of the year with pit on Tuesday Hy State travels to Chapel Hill and then Duke on Monday night a lot of great basketball still to be played in the ACC we look at Florida States upcoming schedule as you mentioned that trip to Georgia Tech which has been a tough place to win throughout this season and then at Pittsburgh we know that theyre going to be hungry to get wins so it does not get any easier for Florida State coming down the stretch 240 to play its a ninepoint game three possessions here for the wolf pack defensively Spears has been terrific Off the Bench for Coach ham eight to shoot double team coming heres Miller against diara and now the pass turned over to morcel heres diara against Miller layup rolls in from modara and a Kevin Keats timeout that was a great job by NC State converging on the onlya play for the former Florida State assistant Dennis Gates of Missouri from Montreal Saint Saint in France is Mohamed diara by the way thats toward the Bordeaux region yeah yeah you lost me with Laughter France theyre going to polish up the geography before were done another die Y what a feed by Spears worly the easy dunk stand the man Jones was just having a conversation with Primo Spears regarding how you handle the pressure going into the timeout and here we can see Watkins and Taylor once again getting mixed up but he was talking to Primo Spears about handling the pressure Primo Spears now six assists against Syracuse which is a season High last time now this time dropping it off to Cameron Korn for his fifth assist here on the evening Spears having a terrific half terrific ball game Watkins the foul puts Taylor at the line just under two minutes to play in a ninepoint game and J Taylor has it bounce around and drop off this games been very testy for two teams that havent seen each other all year yep but that shows you exactly how important each and every one of these games are to finish the ACC Applause season and Taylor got the back end dont forget tomorrow night on acc Network number eight Duke at home back to Cameron against Louisville at 700 and then Rivals reunited coach Kan and Roy Williams at 900 follows the action from Cameron its all on AC Network and streaming live on the ESPN app Florida State trying to pick up their fifth ACC win at home with Miami still to go close the regular season right Spears put Watkins up to bat for the dunk and as nice as the pass was I think the Finish may have been even more impressive on that play Taylor drops the three and another Kevin Keat timeout with 122 to play but I love the way Primo Spears is sharing the basketball WD sharing is caring and this is the way you help out your teammate getting in the pain this evening Marcus Burton has 29 in the ball game for Notre day you ready for this hes your Rookie of the Year ACC Rookie of the Year okay again there have been a lot of great rookies this season in the ACC but for my vote it goes to Marcus BG hes had the highest usage rate of any player in the league oh yeah this year no question and he has strived in his first year in college basketball tell you what hes backed it up in the leag too 75 seconds to go Florida State against pressure Watkins and Spears Miller and theres a foul on Dr and thatll put Baba Miller at the line where he is just a 51 free throw shooter well there is a little bit of a spot for improvement it is this particular discipline for the sophomore from Spain and I believe that was the questioning of the pass by Primo Spears thats one where if youre Spears you want to make them force them to foul you or try to get it back to jir Watkins the guys who are used to handling their business at the free throw line however Baba Miller steps up and knocks down the first one with ease shot that one like Koozie not not 51 I was not expecting Koozie no of course did Koozie shoot underhand no no that was Rick Barry okay next one is also good you sure Koozie didnt shoot underhanded I dont think so okay it was a long it was a long time before Rick Barry heres more C wasnt that long didnt play when they had a jump ball after every made pass heres Taylor all the way through hell scoop and score he ties his career high now hes got 22 in the Ball Game Boy Jaden Taylor Off the Bench he in Primo fears have shown you that you dont have to run out on the floor when the game starts to impact your team and its all about who finishes not about who starts and Leonard Hamilton has relied on Primo Spears Kevin Keats has relied on Jaden Taylor to give them strong production here Cory Dy state is having a hard time getting this and itll belong to the NOS Kevin Keats has got his defensive group set diara to defend the inbounds pass morcel Taylor horn and middle Brooks all in the front court all in the back court and a travel on Miller who took steps yeah after you get the basketball inbounds it becomes a spot throw in Baba Miller not aware of that and you see moving his feet to make that pass Lea cell right on top of that that is a travel you can run before after a May Basket right but once they threw it in bounds called that timeout that took away the ability to be able to run under the basket so that is the right call and the Lea cell going over making sure that no time ran off the clock right because thats a dead ball turnover put a second and 310 back on so Taylor to put it in play Jaden tried to find an alley and went to Morel got deflected by Spears that was almost 5 Music seconds and here comes Corin for Chandler Jackson Music 50 seconds left the lead is seven midd Brooks trying to get to it and it got batted away Ben making the save back to horn horn lost the dribble and he fights for it he turned it over that possession was doomed for failure when you consider how it started out and it took even longer to turn it Music Applause over for to St to the line so now with 37 12 left Florida States going to shoot free throws you see NC State it starts out difficult for Middle Brooks to even gather possession and then just miss handling the basketball for horn cam corn right on top of it to be able to pick it up 14 turnovers tonight for NC State who only come in averaging 94 but thats what Florida state does they put that pressure pressure on you forcing 152 turnovers a game close to their average those with a plus three margin Cory in the turnovers as jir Watkins knocks down the free Applause throw and thats amazing for a team that averages 12 turnovers a game yep lead back to eight and a chance to go to nine again and there it is so 9081 with 35 seconds left we talked about it both these teams are fine with playing in the 80s and90s heres Taylor all the way through Jaden Taylor adding to his totals Applause tonight hes got 24 to lead the wolf pack and Florida States going to wind this thing out theyll get their 15th win of the year its their six straight home win against NC State and the second time in ACC play the nuls have scored 90 or more Cory well in the NOS now with a six game consecutive winning streak here at the tuck over NC State this has been a house of horrors for Kevin ke bringing his team here and it continues with a big win for the simal here at home Florida State headed to Atlanta on Saturday to see Georgia Tech Cory and Dave will be in Chapel Hill its part of our ESPN triple header the Tar Heels and the wolf pack at Smith Center great to be with Cory Alexander Wester a reminder of the final Florida State 90 NC State 83
