for the Yellow Jacket Georgia Tech the number eight seed only eight scholarship players available they have endured a very tough season in terms of injuries but playing well at this time of the year heres James up high on the wing Cooper flag floating into the corner oh with the top and malawat could not get the dunk to go back outside for Proctor straight on and he cant hit it malawat tried to keep it alive the tip but back over to the yellow jackets you often see the Blue Devils come out with an opportunity for malawat at The Rim this time unable to finish it off but establishing him early and that theyre going to be a presence in the paint now keep an eye on kickball here on Nathan George number one boy the yellow jackets one of the top assist men in the country about 6 and a half per game he had eight of them against Virginia yesterday and when you look at Nate George hes going to be looking to get the basketball to the guy with the B his hands now B Dango who has an advantage off the bounce showing it early of the first possession offensively against malot Bo the 69 sophomore from senagal named third Team all ACC this week yesterday went for 16 10 and also four blocks hes a superb Defender Cooper flag with a touch to the paint outside for James and he cant sink it and the advantage we always talk about theres an advantage to having played the day before Georgia Tech got a win yesterday over Virginia theyre used to the facility theyre used to the rims and they have a comfort level of playing on this floor Duke this is their first opportunity often times it takes the top four seeds a little more time to warm up and Dongo on the drive and the block from behind by malat going to get a second effort pile on the Baseline and will turn it over and Dongo doing a great job attacking malow watch off the bounce but the problem is he tries to go back to the right hand bringing the basketball back to malawat youve got to finish with the left hand avoid the shot blocker use that Rim as a shield follow watch all ACC honorable mention 72 kiple with the drive with the left hand and Duke is on the board K nipple more than just a shooter has the ability to play off the bounds get to The Rim finishing with that left hand was something well see a lot of from he and kooper flag throughout this game Jade mooff The Freshman on of Maryland bouncing here for Duncan pow went off for 21 against Virginia most of those in the paint malat again cleans it up hey good luck getting inside yeah its going to be tough when you consider youve got malawat sitting back there waiting for you and thats one of the things that you know the Duke staff talked to their team about is allowing malawat to be that defender on the backside not fouling and bailing guys out when you know you got the big fell behind you Music seven to get up a shot here and Dongo wild pass out high with two on the shot clock pow takes a look and he cant sink it rebound batted around it comes right back to Georgia Tekken and Dango and Dongo on malat that should be very entertaining today picks up the loose ball and a whistle with five on the shot clock and indongo is down and on his back needing some help to rise and a foul on KH kiple will be his first take a look at the leg when you see the left ankle of bay and Dongo getting caught up underneath kipples body on that possession fortunate to avoided major injury but a turnover on the underneath out of bounds play Proctor off a terrific fake flag around the back Proctor lifts and too strong but look at K can nipple coming in from out of nowhere to come up with the offensive rebound great movement another terrific fake canle fakes again and two and you see the respect that Bango has as a shot blocker however KH can nipple after the pump fake getting into the body of indongo not allowing him to jump to contest his shot Duke averaging 83 three points a game holding their opponents to 61 they are ranked as the most efficient offense in the country George on the attack to the Baseline heres Powell outside with a long one and hell stick the triple and Duncan Powell whos been a tremendous amount of time with bonsy Wells of course former NBA legend with the Portland Trail players veteran and he has really started to play like bonsi bons spend taken a lot of pride in getting him together as damus AA has taken a lot of pride in Nate George becoming the point guard that he has Georgia Tech got the turnover could not convert on a close one by George in a missfire heres flag a three off the front iron Duke with another offensive rebound flag again over for Applause two so a cool start for the Duke Blue Devils way downtown gge with a Miss Duke owns the second highest net in Ken palom history as Proctor will lay that one in averaging 12 points a game coming in they lost him for a little more than a game earlier this season you talk about duke it hasnt been all clean sailing all the time it has not and this is another edition of this years Blue Devils team no Jay Lucas associate head coach with them at the ACC tournament as Nate George is able to get into the paint and score so weve seen multiple Duke teams weve seen the team without Malik Brown we watched the team without Mason Gillis we saw them without tyres procer and now Jay Lucas on the side no Jay Lucas on the sideline its a different addition for this group thats a voice some of these guys are used to hearing in that huddle bror tulong specifically that guy Tyrese Proctor hes been with them his entire career at Duke three years and now you can consider that voice is no longer there its going to be different for Proctor for Caleb Foster for seon James the point guards who normally rely on J Lucas for their guance Foster Evans and brown getting ready to check into the game for Duke and a basket count that hell be headed to the line as well Bayon Dango really active offensively early he was aggressive early yesterday but now a much bigger task for Bayan Dongo having to score over the reach of malow watch however hes successful for the bucket and opportunity for and one when we Music return a trip down memory lane to the last time these two teams met each other in the ACC tournament and Coach Hy was a big part of it and when I asked him about it he smiled and said I do believe Cooper flag was for at the time but what he could recall about about the game is that it was not a great shooting performance for him from three he said when coach Kay describes it he says he was over 18 he said the number grows every time he tells someone but he does recall no Nolan Smith playing with him coming off of a screen knocking down a three that essentially won them the game at this point Duke is 0 for six from three he said for Coach Kay he remembers in spite of the slump Coach K always believed in him and that that type of support is necessary thats how he coaches and you can see how hes coaching in that last huddle for these guys to get out of that something and three thats absolutely how its been for John CH for three years hes had tyres Proctor and weve watched tyres Proctor grow as a player throughout those three years and hes pretty much taken on that type of relationship with Proctor hes always believing in him for him to be the best best version of himself that he could be so when you think about that John shy learned a lot of those lessons himself as a player culminating here of course in the ACC Championship in 2010 as well a national Music championship canle back out for flag trying to get around Powell and a strong move using that window and that left hand also we talked about it he is one of the best when you think about getting to that left and then finishing using that opposite hand to avoid the shot blocker flag the 19th Duke player to win ACC Player of the Year thats a conference record but he had a chance OB to be the first person to ever win Player of the Year Rookie of the Year and defensive player of the year as Duncan pal knocks down his second three and then dabs up Damon STM along the sideline for good measure I need I need Damon to get up off his knees though he dont have the best knees OB see my issue is the hips hes got the knee issues over there boy you you two are great to pickup game together you know who are not picking one set of hips and one set of knees between two bodies canle on Joor gge try to find Brown inside thatll trickle off of George attack we had a shot of the Duke bench there were talking about the coaches Jay Lucas taking the Miami job not there anymore he did Coach alongside shy in the North Carolina game but no longer its fascinating if that can have an effect in a game like today it really can because when you consider the way that the Blue Devils have started this game is just different you see Caleb Foster on the floor who gave them very good minutes against North Carolina and didnt play the game prior against Wake Forest so thats a voice that Caleb has been used to hearing throughout this entire year encouraging him to be able to go out and perform at his best but now will Avery will take over that responsibility and of course will Avery a great point guard at Duke himself so hes more than capable of doing so but the difference in voices is always going to play a factor now Georgia Tech on top 138 Suare got the foul for Georgia Tech moments ago Caleb Foster into the contest canle averaging 14 from the corner Evans terrific threepoint guy but not this time George wants to push the tempo every chance he gets and for the record for those who are new viewers of the Blue Devils if there are any theyre the best shooting team from threepoint land in the ACC right now 0 seven but they shoot 38 as a team on the year travel four turnovers for Georgia Tech keep an eye on that Duncan Powell with two made threepoint field goals the Blue Devils dont have one yet and dammar has to be happy with the start that theyve gotten here in the ACC tournament taking that experience from yesterday and allowing that to build some momentum at the beginning of this this is the coldest un and I have seen Duke early in a game all season flag dumps it outside for foster and he misses another one so just not falling theres a lid on it for Duke early oh for eight and George will slow it down outstanding player ACC assist leader and in the top 10 in the nation an assist per game and this is a mismatch here that Dongo need to take advantage of however he finds the hot guy and Duncan pal whenever theres going to be a double team theres going to be someone open Im not sure if thats the one you want to leave open Duncan pal continues his hot start here at the ACC tournament well hes been pressed into the starting lineup over the last month been one of the best six men in the conference a whistle with 1129 to go here in the first half and Georgia Tech in front 16 to8 a lot of respect between these two coaches happy to see each other other both Elite competitors that love is gone now OB its war between the lines by principal and when you consider the way that dunck and Powell relocates to the right spot you see the double team coming well really not much of a double team there they just guys are off the spot but allowing Bay and Dongo to deliver a strike the pal on the opposite side is able to find the L has knock down his third threepoint field goal of the day experts at work not the Blue Devils defensively on that possession getting caught No Mans Land allowing them to get screened off from the shooting and Duncan pow a 21point game yesterday off to a quick start today he just finished second in voting for ACC Sixth Man of the Year to Jeremiah Wilkinson of Cal man what a game last night between Stan stf for and Cal Stanford winning in the end a very tight battle couple of Great Performances yes do yakovich playing great no no Wilkinson in that game for Cal St Yakov going for a career high 37 points almost getting his cow team to a win Music un a little shorthanded against in the big game next team r o another big performance for Stanford Herer flag got it up there but misfires in close a loose ball and pow will collect it OB look at all the gold jerseys every time pooper flag goes to the basket theres a crowd around him and without the Blue Devils making threes right now Georgia Tech is going to continue to flood the lane every time one of the Duke players tries to attack the ri Duke has gone scoreless for over three minutes Dongo for Sutton hell lift and sinks it he knocks down to three how about this the Yellow Jackets four of six from Beyond The Arc Duke yet to make one and give damire his staff a tremendous amount of credit theyve come out with confidence after a win yesterday they feel like they can take down the number one team in the country Duke now over for nine outside the threepoint line here in the quarterfinal of the ACC tournament Duke looking a little confused Georgia Tech looking very confident Terry off the window no malawat yanking down to Applause rebound Duke needs somebody James spinning into the lane yes a much needed bucket for the Blue Devil seon James attacking the rim not allowing the defense to get set so you dont see as many gold jerseys in the painted area when you attack Georgia Tech won the tournament here in Charlotte twice in 1990 and again in 1993 they beat Carolina in 93 Virginia in the 1990 season Nate George with a miss and CER flag with a board he wants to go and a backcourt foul as two players go down Proctor hitting the deck and he is on his back along with and Dongo and theyre going to get the big guy indongo for his first personal foul and both guys getting tangled up here on the way out I I would have like to see a double foul on that one if youre going to I mean you got to call something so I appreciate the fact that there was call but I think Proctor may have been just as guilty as indongo on that one I think both guys really getting tangled up sounded like a car crb yeah oh it was a hard hit both of them hit the ground very hard on that possession GLE a feathery pass malat with a little hook for two nice touch by malawat there and also recognizing if he goes up theres a chance that shot gets blocked with the D coming behind him the pump a allows him to get to feet square and knock down the short jump hook so 1912 coming up in the 9minute mark Gillis came in to interrupt that pass and kiple got shoved the foul goes against the yellow jackets Daren Sutton was there on the Baseline the foul goes against Lance Terry and his Music first and so Duke trying to turn the momentum Georgia Tech 17 and 15 and after beating Virginia yesterday 6660 they out rebounded the who 44 26 in that win proor loses it and Dango bounces for Terry hell slam it a great job by and Dango getting his head up seeing Terry sprinting right beside him normally the guy without the ball is going to be faster Terry was able to get to the rim quickly he slaming Applause Music Applause home canipa lifts boy they cant buy a threepointer malawat went for the save but right back to the yellow jackets Georgia Tech the number eight seed but they upset Louisville they upset Clemson theyre the only team in the ACC to beat both of those talking about the number two two and the number three seed in this tournament tough catch there by andang and Banks it in what an outstanding move ob one thing Ive got to mention have we seen Malik Brown yet he has not come in the game and Malik Brown who had a huge performance at Carolina knock down two threes has yet to be in this game and spell kamam alaat you know Brown was coming back from missing four games as seon James is going to pick up the foul and it will be Georgia Tech to take over 738 to go leading 232 and Georgia Tech being the scrappy team to start this game Bay and Dongo finding L Terry for the finish at The Rim Music and assistant assistant coaches is a very important relationship in the game of college basketball you see as soon as Cooper flag comes out of the game associate head coach Chris Carwell whose primary responsibility is working with Cooper flag comes over immediately to have a conversation with him to talk about what has happened on the floor Cooper flag one to five from the field right now only two points and more importantly zero free throws when you consider the relationship between the two all other coaches have multiple players as a responsibility Chris Carell only has one it will be the with Award winner the national play of the Year Cooper flag and hes done a tremendous job with him this season they have a very close relationship we go to the practices we see how before a walk through begins or a shoot around Chris goes right there to Cooper they work for like 30 minutes just the two of them they really do and Im not sure that the outside world recognize how improved Cooper flag is from November the 4th till March the 13th he has completely changed his game in most importantly his ability to play off the dribble and make plays for his team a flag off to choppy start certainly Duke is the RO for 10 beyond the threepoint line Pals been hot and a missfire here it goes back over to Duke Duke the number one threepoint shooting team in the ACC but they havent hit one yet and when you also consider that Duke is the best defensive team in the ACC and one of the best defensive teams in the country but Georgia Tech not at all phased by shooting 53 from the field even at after the Miss by Duncan Powell theyre still shooting 50 from three flag trying to take the Baseline went for the dunk and hes denied by and Dango whos skyed up for the rejection try to turn that into points heres Terry but no pow went for the save and hes able to do it deflecting it off kles and Obi weve seen badongo do this time and time again hes not afraid to challenge anyone at the rim this time he wins the battle against Cooper flag trying to go off the bounce for the Blue Devils its du something other than shoot threes flag trying to get to the rim and finish by and Dango having no parts of that and Dango third Team all ACC this week number four rebounder in the ACC had four blocks yesterday against Virginia just had himself a moment against Cooper flag mustaf off the fake at the foul line shot clocks down to one po has to hustle rebound tipped and control by Duke but you look at the last two threepoint fi goals that PO has had to take their rush they at the end of the shot clock in comparison to the three good books he was able to get prior Im looking around the arena the Duke fans are stunned right now canle with another Miss on a triple they dont know how to react to this well I think theyve never seen this before with this group they havent seen this team struggle to shoot the ball youre talking about a team that averages close to 11 3point field goal maze per game and right now theyre 0 for1 come here here mustaf will draw the foul hell be headed to the line back to that Sensational block well Im sure John sire told his team hey dont settle for threes lets attack the basket Cooper flag trying to do as his coach asked however Bay and Dango denying the opportunity and when you block a shot with two hands thats doing something thats big time right there but indongo going straight up getting both hands on the basketball denying the opportunity for Cooper flag at The Rim I mean its a great block technique wise and everything else but it was against Cooper flat well I mean thats it well and Bay Dango seen the video hes hes seen Dave OBrien talking about oh my after Cooper flag is dunked on peoples but Bay Dongo up for the challenge meets Cooper at the summit and wins that battle lets go to Angel Cory you were just mentioning how the Duke fans have not seen this team shoot this bad from the threepoint area this season well they were 4 for 24 against Kentucky mind you theyve only been down two times this season at half time but they wind up winning both of those games the turnaround is important but to your point Cory this is the energy that youre seeing from the previous day for Georgia Tech where they put up monstrous numbers together it it really has been Angel and you also consider what theyve done defensively still Duke unable to get a three down and even with Malik ground in the game now Duke is different offensively they space it out opening up the lane even more but it still has had no effect for the Blue Devils on the offensive end theyre shooting 27 73 from the field youre right though Brown getting into the game he missed four came back against North Carolina last weekend hit two big threes we had a long sit today he really did he didnt play for the first 12 and 12 minutes of this game John sire normally gets him in earlier because of plays like this getting deflections and the energy he brings from the defensive end of the floor George bodies up with him now goes by him on the drive scoop shot and tipped up and in by indongo but hes everywhere he absolutely is everywhere and this is the type of performance we saw for him with the double double yesterday and Malik Brown is H again OB holding on to that same left shoulder that we saw him injure at Virginia and when we saw that play at Virginia it was a non contct play that shoulder popped and he is in agony anybody whos ever had a shoulder injury it is incredible incredibly painful wow and this Arena went silent fast as Malik Brown has to walk down the tunnel and heading for the locker room in Music agony Georgia Tech meanwhile leading 262 Duke has gone scoreless now for 4 and A2 Music minutes biggest lead of the day here for Georgia and its its simply just Nathan George running into the shoulder and as Malik Brown sticks out that left shoulder to try to get back in defensively its a very similar to what we saw at Virginia just getting in the passing Lane there was contact on this one but I had a teammate who was just inducted into the Hall of Fame by the name of johy bips who dealt with the same issue early in his NBA career he had to have both shoulders preped and went on to have a great NBA career but when you have those issues its difficult to be able to play basketball confidently and not think about your shoulder coming out of side meanwhile credit Georgia Techs defensive pressure and how energized they are no easy shots heres flag and another Miss from threepoint land that is the story they old for 133 Music weve seen this before when you in the quarterfinals when you have a team that has a double buot and they dont get an opportunity to get in the arena and shoot and have their shoot around their practice on Monday like some of the other teams do and then theyre playing against a team that has played a day prior mof around and out flag trying to get inside draws the foul before the shot with with 356 to go in the first half and what a story this has become a look of concern there on the face of John Shire you really havent seen that much this year its all around the arena for the Duke Music fans ball brought to you by principal let our expertise round on yours and by Bill Burr drop dead years the hilarious standup special that Premier is on March 14 streaming on Hulu Duke 14 down without a basket for 5 and a half minutes their first double digit deficit since they trailed NC State by 13 although they won that game 74 to 64 when they have been down by double digits theyre three and one but just moments ago Malik Brown leaving the floor and OB you see reaching in for the basketball not much contact at all and again if you ask the Duke patrons theyll tell you that being down isnt that big of a deal losing Malik Brown is a much bigger deal because you may not see him again this season after entering that left shoulder for a second time nice work by canle kept on digging and digging he has six and Duke looking for somebody to start to make baskets and Duke now going to his Zone defensively this is often what they do with Patrick GBA along the back line and gunga Standing Tall coming up with a huge denial the third block for the blue Applause doubles the nice find from Nate George Tango but Patrick gumba along the Baseline ready po a strong move and its Cooper flag to say not this time heres Evans to line one up and finally finally doke HS a triple and just like that and D madmar recognizing the last thing that you need to happen in this building is to see Cooper flag make a play defensively coming from The Blind Side denying the opportunity and turning into a Showtime slim three ball here in his hometown Music Applause Ralph flag extremely excited grandfather Dan Bowman excited about Cooper flags block on the last possession and more importantly about Isaiah Evans three ball off of the defensive stand by the Blue Devils Back In The Zone once again John Shire switching up his defenses to try to throw Georgia Tech off out outside mustaf got a really good look one drop in for him went down grabbing at his left ankle area as he went down after the rebound oh my gets up and needs help Obie this just went from bad to worse for the Blue Devils when you consider youve already lost Malik Brown and Cooper flag needing assistance off the floor and when you consider the height as to which he got that rebound and landed on someones Music foot so Cooper flag the player of the year candidate in pain on the bench theyve already lost Malik Brown to his shoulder again George Will swish in a triple and Nathan George taking advantage of the matchup with Patrick gumba trying to guard him on the perimeter piple got inside and up and in for two by Gung bu and big Pat who gained tremendous experience with Malik Brown has been out multiple times during this season Once with the sprain knee once with the shoulder is now stepping into the lineup and giving the Blue Devils big plays on both ends of the floor into the corner heres Powell rebound tipped out of play itll be Duke ball Music 2919 take a look at his Applause reaction and in a lot of pain Obie Ive known this young man for a very long time and hes as tough as they get for him to come out oh gangba again gangba giving Duke a lift giving them that threat on the interior that you normally get with Cooper flag attacking the basket gumba doing it differently but just as effective but back to Cooper for him to G it down he is truly in pain you saw him jump up he wanted to walk it off but but that ankle would not allow it to happen pile banging underneath went for the reverse not there Duke to push it long one coming and swished in again its Isaiah Evans we saw Jaylen Withers do it yesterday coming back to his hometown of Charlotte North Carolina Isaiah Evans is back home OB and hes starting to heat up and Dongo turns and Fir no one defended him he has 11 in the first half his flag needs help to get off the floor heading for the locker room and a whistle with 413 to go in the first half and that is a sight that makes Duke Hearts drop all over the country man did this place get some kind of quiet on this play look how high he was and then you consider how far hes coming down to land on the side of that left ankle painful to watch and again it doesnt get much tougher than this young man OB but its hard to come back from a roll like that goodness Proctor at the line and Duke has tighten it up 31 to 26 seon James back on the floor now for John shy and Evans out hes given him a nice Lift Off the Bench as he often does the McDonalds allamerican final seconds of the first half a fascinating half it has been here in Charlotte North Carolina in the ACC quarterfinals how kicks it back out mustaf on the drive Terry got Airborne James stuck right with him then he drives the Baseline and Gillis comes up with a loose ball and a strong stand by GBA denying that opportunity at The Rim give Patrick gumba tremendous amount of credit come on malawat with two fouls Malik Brown out of the game gumba stepping up on a defensive B offensively as Music well 3 Music Music Duke the number one team of the country how can they be stopped with at the top of anybodys list injuries health is so important when especially if youre trying to make a run and March Malik Brown an extremely important member of this Duke Blue Devil team reaggravating that left shoulder injury which we saw and then Cooper flag after grabbing the rebound landing on that left ankle immediately grasping at the ankle and you can see of course tremendous concern on the faces of Ralph and Kelly flag Coopers parents rightfully so but I can tell you one thing they are most concerned about the Blue Devils winning this game that is their number one priority they are all in Duke Blue time for last second shot itll be Evans back in and left it short Georgia Tech with a rebound and the yellow jackets own the first half although Duke did to salvage something outside heres Pow with a shot clock down to seven mof deep in the corner trying to get around the hip of kiple and blocked there by malawat with malawat on the floor the yellow jackets continue to think about him every time they drrive open look there for Gillis cant connect and itll go the other way whos going to get that OB thats not me unless I have two two ladders I think 3126 lets go to Angel well guys guys when I was able to catch up with Kos he said mainly that without Cooper flag and as well as Malik Brown that is when they went on their run they had they ended the half 12 on a 12 to five run and he said thats an example of how defense has to spark our offense you showed the blocked by Cooper flag and he mentioned thats what were going to miss the most his helps side defense but at the end of the day his message has always been focus on whos on the floor we have to get stops he felt they were way too tight on the offensive end and just playing more relaxed together Angel and you know this very well of course after being on the court for so long when someone one of your teammates goes down you often play for that guy and of course with the Blue Devils right now theyre playing not only for themselves but for Cooper and Malik as well youre playing for two and a very popular assistant coach as well so theres a lot of guys who arent here for Duke right now starting to heat up kiple now at nine you within two and now the Blue Devils have made three threepoint field goals and Angel you had something else for as theyve made three F go three threepointers that has been without Malik and Cooper flag on the floor so when I was in the back being able to listen in on their locker room this is a team that sounded like they actually had a 10point lead they have not lost their enthusiasm coach sh talked about the optimism that they had and the focus that they need to play with in the second half and ob one thing that can often happen with teams and again Cooper flag is a great teammate and his teammates love him but they also hear Cooper flag and Duke they dont hear Duke they hear Cooper flag and Duke so this is an opportunity for the Blue Devils for seon James for Tyrese brocker KH canle to prove that theyre also great players and that this team can still be successful without Cooper without Malik on the floor and again theyre a much better team with those guys but theres a lot of Pride within this program where these guys want to show that they can get it done without the best player in the country on flag d Duke scoring leader rebounding leader assist leader but also Steals and blocks and wasnt it fascinating to hear coach shy say were going to miss him because of his defense maybe more than anything well and thats one of the areas of concern weve already seen it with Georgia Tech when they attack the basket theyre looking for Comm malawat well imagine when You got both Cooper and malawat on the floor you dont feel like there evers going to be any easy opportunities especially in the paint weve seen Cooper flag already in this in the first half go up and deny an opportunity that led to a threepointer by Isaiah Evans on the other end of the floor so you cant replace his production but guys can go out and give you even more heart even more effort yeah and dont look now but Duke has tied the game they were down by 14 and here come their fans in Charlotte but look at Tyrese procer picking up 94 ft this the first time weve seen this in this game he wasnt doing that in the first half but hes locked in even more knowing hes got to do it without his brother Terry With A Little Fall Away cant stick that and now Dukes trying to jump out in front theyve been trailing all day Gillis straight on around and Applause out and again the threepoint shooting continues to be an issue but a top threepoint shooting team in the ACC rof may have come off this building if he did knock that one down not kidding that pass will float out and a whistle with 1726 to go in the contest here in the quarterfinal and a foul will go against tyres Proctor well North Carolinas next RJ Davis about to take on Wake Forest the 54 game in the quarterfinals what is running through his head right now having watched that first half and seen the injuries to Duke they were hoping to be on a collision course with semifinals on Friday night hes thinking Ive got to continue to win to keep my career alive and to make sure I get an opportunity to play in the NCAA tournament well thats right right now Joel lardy our bracketologist has them in the tournament on the switch yesterday after a big win around and out canle with the board and another opportunity for Duke to take the lead last time they L it was six to five here it comes from James got it Duke by three SE James another one of the leaders of this team stepping up in the absence of two of his teammates knocking down a huge three and James also was an all defensive team member this year though getting the stop Dongo going down triy to get that to a teammate Sutton couldnt handle it kick back over to Duke leading 3431 without Cooper flag and Malik Brown a blocked by pal but it comes free to Gillis heres Proctor in the corner James again kipple flying in for the rebound smart play by canle nothing going get it back out run offense Force George detect to have to guard you longer on the possession proor Nifty dribble cant stick it back up again no the follow is up and in by malawat and Duke since halftime on a 10 nothing run Applause Music spns exclusive presentation of college basketball is brought to you by principal let our expertise round out yours you know its synonymous under Coach K Duke basketball is that first four minutes of the next half and Duke would put that hammer down thats exactly Cory what theyre doing right now to Georgia Tech and it doesnt matter if its a Cameron Indoor Stadium if its at Madison Square Garden or if its at the Spectrum Center in Charlotte North Carolina and you will see that from the Devils thats absolutely how they started this second half after going down five points into the halftime locker room its been a 100 Run for the Blue Devils to start the second half Damon STM concerned as to where hes going to get scoring against this Duke Blue Devil team and a pick by Proctor and will slam it down and Duke continues to roll Music 3831 this is their biggest lead today in this quarterfinal Applause the yellow jackets need a hot hand Terry averages 15 a game working on Proctor who goes down on the seat of his pants but a bad misfire itll be kicked out off of Duke with 1509 left proor making plays doing the job defensively coming up with the steel also the Highlight to give his team a sevenpoint Music lead e e e e welcome back well before the break we saw Cooper flag who was Will to a room for xrays good news here that he is able to walk on his own coming back to the floor this is back in the tunnel where he was getting looked at for his ankle yes Duke is on a 120 run but the fans in this building were cheering for him walking all the way back to the bench hes officially ruled out today because of the anle but to see him on the floor Cory you mentioned how tough this guy is he wants to be here for his team and for what goes on moving past this game he absolutely is Angel and even more encouraging watching him walk out no boot without a boot without a boot hes got on his of course his think pink Kobe sixes and so when you look at that that an encouraging sign no boot on Im sure that there will be a tremendous amount of rehab at ice Etc but normally if there is structural damage you would be in a boot or even worse a cast but without him Duke has surged into the lead theyre making some shots theyre on top 3833 without him and Malik Brown also out of the game and will not return and Aaron pass C there went for the save what a save at midcourt this really is a moment for tyres procer to step up and he has absolutely done so for the Blue Devils here to start this second half off of that three but you can see he has an extra bounce to his steps knowing that he has to to take over that leadership role with flag off the floor George cant hit hes run cold and if you missed it we will show you the injury to Cooper flag a little earlier the alyo doesnt get there but Proctor picks it off and again its James too strong and a whistle in the paint lets go back to him injuring the ankle getting really high up there for that so we had a long way to come down in tremendous pain and having to get helped off the floor that was a concerning spot seeing him in the wheelchair going to get a xray normally thats the thought process but this is the encouraging sign seeing him out sitting on the bench with both shoes on Obie Ive been back in that locker room and getting Xray before I didnt come back out with shoes on K kiple with a Miss usually when flag is out because a foul trouble or something else they lean on canle they lean on kiple for scoring but you need tyres Proctor and seon James to be The Playmakers also another guy on the floor right now Isaiah Evans they leaned on him in the first half he knocked down the the two threes y for Duke in that first session instant offense pile trying to go through him and he does as he banks it in for 11 points this is the area honestly where you miss Cooper flag the most even though hes the ACC player of the year and a lot of it because of what he did on the offensive end you miss him defensively even more than you do offensively that doesnt happen if youve got Cooper flag defending Duncan pal boy three men went down at once as pal went bulling inside 38 35 when youre back there and you had ankle problems so you got taped up a lot you had a lot of ankle injuries you had attended to a lot are you watching the game and playing strict attention to it youre absolutely listening youre hearing and you hear the crowd roaring especially at the beginning of the second half when your team is getting back into the mix youre wanting to get back there on the floor with your guys but if you cant play you want to make sure youre on the bench encouraging and doing anything you can to help your team win in for Evans instant offense for the 66 freshman from bville North Carolina 4135 Duke finding their range from threepoint L yeah Duke will be fine they wont be as good so I dont want anyone to think that theyll be as good offensively with without Cooper flag but theyll be fine P from the corner drains it this is the end of the floor where Cooper flag will be missed the most his rotations his ability to be able to close out and guard off the bounce as well as deny opportunities at The Rim 14 for Duncan PW coming up 21 against Virginia yesterday inside and a layup B End by gangba and gangba continues to give the Blue Devils great minutes offensively shot to see John Shire going manto man right now with gumba on the floor normally this is where he plays Zone when you put Patrick gumba in the game Dongo set the screen out for Terry whos been really quiet for a couple of days here he wants to heat up his bucket gives him four and Duke by three under 12 minutes to play here in Charlotte the winner to advance the semifinals tomorrow and on the attack off the window for two and Isaiah Evans has a reputation of just being a shooter almost a higher gun he has much more to his game youre talking about a McDonalds allam Elite scorer and showing off a little bit more whats in his bag for the last possession its 6 threes against Auburn in that victory in December absolutely on fire shot clock to 10 George on the drive Slams on the brakes and Dongo no Music heres canle yes a triple on the money he has 12 points and when you try to shortcut the screen you often get burned time out and 11 minutes to go and Duke has built an eightpoint lead after trailing by as many as 14 Cooper flag unavailable to help his team on the court however still supporting from the sideline its all about the Brotherhood here in Charlotte countrys best in the Houston Cougars Kelvin Samson trying to win a big 12 tournament and they take his team to the Final Four and possibly a national championship which is the only thing missing from his Hall of Fame resume Duke Blue Devils were down 14 in the first half five at halftime their largest deficit of the year they are without Cooper flag and Malik Brown the rest of the game because of injury and yet they lead by eight against Georgia Tech trying to Spring the upset but they need a comeback they need a hot hand moop on the dribble almost lost it shot clock to five Terry outside Terry on the crossover dribble and yes that was a much needed bucket for the yellow jackets not only to get them Clos to the Blue Devils but also to get Lance Terry feeling good about things his first threepoint field goal of the game one for 10 yesterday and hes the leading scorer for Georgia Tech buba has it knocked away and a foul as Suare down the 69 freshman took a shot 4843 at the 1022 Mark let take a look at this one as gungo went into him caught him with that elbow yeah the elbow coming down afterwards and that may have our officials going over to the monitor Ted Valentine Tony Henderson Tony Henderson and Jerell Spearman will have to go check this one out its you see gangba going up this is all basketball but the coming down part this could be upgraded it could still be a foul on T but this absolutely could be upgraded to a flagrant one foul on gangba I dont know that thats a natural follow through on the shot and the Freshman up with a towel on the face he took a nasty shot I tell you what this floor is not for the meek of heart today it absolutely is not as theyll have to clean up some blood thats a tough hit this quarterfinal round of the ACC tournament very physical s has to head for the training room as well and Dukes got a work out in the first half and now itll be Georgia Tech and the officials did go over and look theyre not going to come away with anything additional after that just a common foul there will be no upgrade on that one so the foul is on Suare the man are just left bleeding yes and again when you take a hit like that Im honestly a little shocked that they didnt come away with anything for that simply because it wasnt it was after the play the wh had already blown and again Patrick gum was not a dirty player in any way whatsoever but whenever you have contact as such you would think that you possibly have some type of upgrade on that well got a legend in the house another one in the great Roy Williams game two coming up North Carolina the winner of this one advancing to the semifinals on Friday North Carolina taking on Wake Forest so we look forward to that one on ESPN as well George with a pullup no well short but look at what Dukes defense has done in the second half they have bottled up Georgia Tech not allowing them to get the driving lanes that they saw early is dango does a great job three quarter fronting and coming away with the Music steel George trying to feed inside but a foul first and again if youre just tuning in Cooper flag went a high for a rebound turned his ankle went down in a lot of pain needed help coming off the floor this was only the first half he was in a wheelchair going to the Xray room down the tunnel but he did return not in a a great sign for Duke but he wont play the rest of the day nor will Malik Brown who missed games because of his shoulder injury and he reinjured that today in the first half they are both out for the rest of this one crosscourt Powell whos been a dangerous man in this tournament taking on kiple oneonone looking for the pass and he threw it away theyve turned it over nine times but Power not recognizing Kamal watch is not on the floor Cooper flag not on the floor thats one youve got to get up on the rim he was trying to avoid taking the shot because of the threat of shot blockers Patrick gumba not as much of a shot blocker as you see with Mal watch and flag and forcing the turnover Damon stmy struggling to figure out how hes going to be able to put points on the board he told our Angel gray at the beginning of the game were going to have to score to beat the Blue Devils but the Blue Devils have absolutely stifled Georgia Tech here in the second half hey coming up tonight on acc Network at 1130 Eastern or after the final quarterfinal matchup and nothing but net crew will have a complete breakdown of the whole day with highlights and alysis interviews and more and take a big look at tomorrows semifinals here at the Spectrum Center and we look forward to game two coming up Wake Forest in North Carolina how you seeing that breakdown I think thats going to be a battle especially when you consider that youve got two guys who were First Team all ACC a season ago and Hunter Salis returns as a first team all ACC member but last seasons ACC Player of the Year RJ Davis going at it and this could be the final game of one of their careers and so when you think about I think both teams are going to leave everything on the floor in a huge match up between the four and five seed in our second game this afternoon k Foster getting some more minutes here in the second half he will feed Evans straight on but that wont fall great look great execution just unable to get it to go down but those are the type of shots you want if your Duke to get Evans in space allow him to be able to operate Music offensively moop goes down kiple trying to guard him still spinning and spinning in a tie up possession arrow will take it the other way so itll be Duke ball with 847 to go Isaiah Evans knocked down the first two threepoint field goals of the game for the Blue Devils also showing off his ability to get to the basket when Duke was struggling from three Evans came in knocked down their first two and he is letting them know this is my city I am from here and Ive got family and friends in the building and I am going to give you a show cuz thats the only reason they call him Showtime slim OB much like jayen Withers I mean for North Carolina yes lighting up as a Charlotte guy one triple after another Mala watch with the slam as kiple Aly him those two guys tried to connect on the first possession of the game for an alley it was unsuccessful this time malawat able to finish above Dango a lot of people felt that kenle should have been First Team all ACC was second team as the voting came out and Dongo Blowing by and no on the slam he said a very different second half Here Comes Evans wide open to nen he is 14 and all of a sudden Duke in front 5443 their biggest lead mustaf trying to answer he cant Proctor with the board hes going to push it kiple lines one up I think the roof would have come off it absolutely would if canipa knocks that one down of course youre going to always have a strong Duke contingent in any Arena you go to but especially when youre in the state of North Carolina Terry needs to heat up fast but that wont fall hes in a very chilly TN B watch hell draw the TR to contain the big guy Georgia Tech commits the personal well you dont have the best freshman however you still got some pretty good ones KH kiple Kon malawat connecting for an alley oops upside your hand Applause Music D Tom Josh thank you very much eight nothing run for Duke and in the second half they have outscored Georgia Tech 282 and again without Cooper flag and when you consider the defensive effort Georgia Tech 0 for five theyve shot 263 in this second half only two of seven for three so Duke has turned the effort up on both ends of the floor and often times when your defense gets going it helps you on the offensive end of the floor he says an awful lot about the makeup of this Duke team kipple outside for Evans the step the fire does Miss many of those seven minutes to go Georgia Tech looking for another big run they had several in the first half by and Dango got it to Terry Terry with the kick for andago another Miss slam but a foul this time but to get the benefit of the doubt when you try to dunk it that time he tries to hammer it home with the left hand if he lays that up first off K malawat is going to smash it against the glass but by and Dango trying to finish strong hes able to get an opportunity at the free throw line to put points on the board James with the personal and two shots coming D go third Team all ACC at 12 double doubles this season he had four games of at least 20 and 10 the sophomore year starting to become a star in Atlanta and we have you covered on selection Sunday once again 600 Eastern Sports Center Rees and the guys looking at the mens field followed by Bracketology and at eight the womens field of 68 revealed with Bracketology and a complete breakdown at 9 Eastern on ESPN 2 D go second his first points of the second half thats a major story Duke of course by lonardi and Company a projected number one seed North Carolina on this floor next Georgia Tech now going to the Zone defensively got imagine they had a hard fought win yesterday against Virginia oh kiple again a great execution by the Blue Devils against the zone and it was everyone Justin Robinson Chris Carwell John everyone was up pointing to spots where they wanted them to go the sixth assist for a kiple George with a spin another short one canip and malawat and once again racing to the other end to play defense Bay and Dongo at the Block Terry hey quick strike and hell be at the line looking for a threepoint play and Damm still trying to figure out how they were able to penetrate against the Zone I believe adango had a little help on this block I think the rim actually got it first but Lance Terry attacking 101 able to finish against seon James in transition down go six blocks in the tournament two more today 5646 seven Duke but Terry at the line he makes Applause 72 and D go averaged a double double in ACC play OB he really got so much better as the season went along and part of the reason why Georgia Tech has won nine of their last 13 games follow watch off for Proctor Proctor jumping in the paint the tip really well done by seon James and very few teams have a point guard at 66 and who knows what he weighs but we know hes strong in pretty much everyone on the floor and seon James that can get inside the defense and tip in the missed opportunity yeah shoots over 50 makes his threes and doesnt turn the ball over Pals been kind of quiet as of late starting to heat up again with a threepointer and George TCH going to need much more of that down the stretch Duncan pal who was the hero yesterday for the Yellow Jackets coming up with a big bucket to get the league back to eight five minutes to go in Charlotte canle threading inside BS it in hell go to the line hes had a really nice couple of series here and with flag on the bench once again canle showing up but you like K canle being aggressive getting downhill attacking off the bounce not just relying on his jump shot as we see his mom Sherry who was a great scorer herself checking out her baby boy doing his work her baby boy at 67 named to the ACC all rookie team second Team all ACC 14 points a game and number two in minutes for Duke behind Cooper flag so its Duke on top 6150 Applause Musta penetrating a block but a foul too and mustaf is down and grimacing but back on his feet the foul on malawat will be his Music third LOF attacking you see that left ankle turn on the foot of watch fortunately able to get up walk it off mustaf started seven or eight games early in the year then missed half a dozen with a foot injury freshman from Maryland will shoot two young man has a lot of Promise Dam thought him out of very high on mustaf feels as though he will be a great player as you see him turned that left ankle feels though hell be a great player in that Georgia Tech uniform which of course if you wear the number three at Georgia Tech you have to be a great player the lineage of that uniform and that number kiple looking to Break Free on the drive and spins in Don kiple taking over here in this second half 17 and doing it attacking the rim not normally the guy that puts the pressure on defenses by getting into the paint thats normally Cooper flags job buried by Powell as he has sprung to life again 21 yesterday 20 today Duncan pow trying to keep the yellow jackets in it but theyre going to have to find a way to get stops and possibly keep the basketball out of the the hands of KH kiple whos had success here in this second half under four minutes to go in Charlotte G nipple and a slam by malawat they are a dynamic 20 those two they absolutely are these two have connected on a number of beautiful feeds throughout this second half as K kiple get the job done attacking the rim well this could have been a nightmare today with with Cooper flag the best player in the country having to depart he was in a wheelchair for a while but man has his team come back to life down 14 without him and yet they have rallied go ahead and sit out CP relax college basketball is brought to you by tro price invest with confidence on what has been a beautiful week here in Charlotte champ week ACC tournament here at the Spectrum Center a look at our bracket and still to come Wake Forest and North Carolina the 4 five game later on tonight the other top four seeds Louisville and Clemson finally get into the tournament and when you consider that the top seeds beat each other throughout this year the only team to beat those top SE seeds was this Georgia Tech Team Duke beat Louisville Louisville beat Clemson Clemson beat Duke so you have an opportunity to see the best in the league get together here possibly in the semifinals but their first mention here quarterfinals so far I hope you brought your chalk to Charlotte Terry on the drive and kiple got a hand on it hes had a big game he really had 17 points 11 of those since halftime five rebounds seven assists I think the seven assist is the most telling sign of how aggressive hes been because youve had to pay so much attention to him hes been able to find malow watch and his teammates and connect with them on a number of buckets yeah those two have been Dynamic five to get off a shot kiple working on indago he slips got it up there didnt touch anything so its a shot clock violation and Dam mmar wanting a double dribble on that possession having a conversation with Ted Valentine on the sideline but ends up being a shot clock violation regardless the turnover and right now its time the yellow jackets time is not on their side theyre going to have to find a way to make a push and quickly George got it up there and hits a three thats one way to do it thats how you do it it doesnt get much much quicker than that OB and not only did you get a bucket it gives you an opportunity to set up your four court pressure the Press into canle and they peel it away with 225 to Applause play and another whistle the first half was owned by Georgia Tech and they had Duke Nation pretty upset because they were down Duke was by as many as 14 points and then they lost the best player in the country and before that they lost their second best defender and Malik Brown theyve been able to overcome that but Lee Brown and Cooper flag out of the ball game one and one time for kiple still tremendous concern for the Blue Devils however they feel a little better with the way K can nipple has played an allaround game throughout this one now up to 18 points his playmaking Distributing but the Duke defense has been back in the second half they didnt see that in the first half and a lot of it had to do with the fact that their offense was strug Music two more for kiple up to 19 points fourth player for Duke in the last 15 Seasons with this kind of a game in the ACC tournament in and out on the shot by pal man that was in the cylinder he was already running back that felt good to him thought he had knocked down another three oh its watch it Rim out two minutes to go quite a comeback for Duke today we havent said that many times this year Proctor on the drive he goes down looking for a foul no whistle George wants to get it to Terry quickly the kick out pile is open and he missed another one he chases down his own misfire and Dango with a dribble down and a whistle with a minute 37 to go and time running short for Georgia Tech the number eight SE 137 on the Music clock and so thatll put Terry at the line the foul on Mason Gillis will be his first I should say not a shooting foul George will check it in and inongo whos been impressive here in this tournament Sutton is open yes a three On Target and thats been two threes that the yellow jackets have been able to make in the last couple of minutes so theyre actually getting some opportunities got it down to six but theyre going to have to find a way to get stops minute 10 to go duke using the clock kles fouled Over The Back by Sutton picks up his second a minute six to go and it will be a one and one and you dont necessarily mind the foul because you dont allow the Blue Devils to kill more clot the problem is youre sending their best free throw shooter to the line and Khan can nipple yeah 91 three for three today 19 points and Counting for the Freshman out of Milwaukee and I dont believe it was a possession that damire wanted to foul he was looking to try to see if they could get a stop still more than enough time to be able to get multiple possessions but if you were going to foul there were other people that you would have chosen you would have fouled seon James with the ball at half court he makes the pair for 21 points 69 61 George lustin kipple Scoops bad slams it down Duke by 10 Again emphatically Terry getting down and tied up possession will keep it on this end for Georgia Tech but you talk about weathering a storm today thats what Duke has done they really have and Nate George just loses the basketball KH can nipple keeping his head up allowing Kam Mala to show off his ball handling skills in the open floor and then of course get up on the rim canle the biggest star today with 21 points eight assists and five rebounds so a standout performance for him in the quarterfinals George getting it off for Terry and that one rattles in from threepoint land so the yellow jackets continue to to fight with 37 seconds to go theres no quit in them and this is what theyve done all season long they continue to fight regardless of the opponent and the Gods giving every bit of effort they have just havent been able to get the job done on the offensive end damis star told us pregame theyre going to have to score to beat Duke 64 points not enough when youre going up against the best offensive and defensive team in the league still to come North Carolina and wake for due to start at 230 today our next quarterfinal and we go to our Dynamic play of the game brought to you by T pares it is Khan kiple who has been the man with a plan in the second half for the Blue Devils coming up with the steel kicking it ahead to his fellow freshman kamam alaat who drops the hammer to give the Blue Devils a 10point lead late in this second half canip bull with the 21 15 since halftime and remembering that it looked pretty bad for Duke at that point they had their largest halftime deficit of the season they were without Cooper flag and without Malik Brown and since that point they have played their best basketball of the day they really have got off to a very Rusty start you could see that the BL Devils had not played on this floor and the yellow jackets had they had game experience under their belt however do Duke starting to loosen up later in that first half Isaiah Evans coming in knocking down a couple threes hes got that nothing easy Jersey on boy thats aole the day theyve had the day hes had and we shall see if hell be available in the next round should Duke hang on and win this one leading 7164 even if he is OB Im not playing him youre not playing him no matter what hes not playing hes not playing any more in Charlotte hes got to sit because at the end of day when you consider what your the goal is again John Shys won the ACC tournament Championship already in his three years he did that in his first year you have enough with this team without Cooper flag to try to win a ACC tournament Championship Im going to take my chances with the Blue Devils and trying to win without Cooper flag and see if we can win a National Championship with a he healthy coer flag now Carolina of course du hated rival waiting in the wings hate is such a strong word it its appropriate you know true but its just such a strong word I think its a little light to describe that rivalry between the two it is just a little light canle 22 in Applause come and of course if they do Clash and North Carolinas going to get by Wake Forest the number four seed but if they do Clash in the semifinals du will be trying to beat them for the third time this season is very tough to do Ive heard that however I got smacked by North Carolina in 93 twice in the regular season and then they beat us again in the ACC tournament here in Charlotte so it wasnt that difficult for the tar Hills that year that Tar Hill team did go on to win a National Championship so I shouldnt feel too bad about it theyre awfully good 257 to go 7366 and two shots coming here for the Duke Blue Devils trying to Salt this one away at the foul line in the quarterfinal round and Duke very smart getting the basketball every time to the best foul shooter on the floor there for Damon stanmire a couple of really nice wins this season upsetting number 21 Louisville and top 25 Clemson in that wild triple overtime game so it had some really nice moments yeah absolutely did they dealt with more injuries probably than anyone in the league throughout this year Damon felt really good about his team coming into the season finished the majority of the season with six to seven scholarship players available but when you look at the star stories for the blue doubles this afternoon it was the Freshman that stepped up and not the Freshman that you would expect right but three three freshman for the Blue Devils with 24 and 14 14 points respectively canle again and once again theyll foul him with 142 to go duke on the edge of their 29th win of the Season Duke owning the second highest net rating in Ken palom history only the 98 Duke team was higher and kiple to shoot two again and he has been Dukes brightest star today with Cooper flag unavailable for a huge chunk because of the ankle injury KH kiple tying his career high Obie we saw him go for his career high 25 points against Miami so with this free throw no Jinx he has now set a new career high in his first ACC Tournament game final second Powell on the move against James and hell back it in Sixpoint game 67 and itll be James inbound looking for kiple again and they get it to him in another foul with 5 point8 Seconds to play put this one out of reach at the line 26 points 20 in the second half along with eight assists and five rebounds and hes played 39 minutes yeah hes had to carry a heavy load offensively for the Blue Devils without Cooper flag in this one and has been up to the challenge as he continues to solve this game away at the free throw line great execution by the Blue Devils by the way getting the basketball in the hands of their best free throw shooter and Khan kiple has taken care of business down the stretch well we thought Georgia Tech was a dark horse but about to be eliminated from the ACC tournament they gave Duke quite a scare in the first half after winning yesterday but today Duke overcomes and it was a long afternoon but they win it 7870 very serious injury concerns but Duke moves on to the semifinals seven
