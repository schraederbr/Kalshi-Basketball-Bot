Brian Oonnell Tony Chiaza and Matt Carter are your officials And DeMarco Miner will set up the Pittsburgh offense Pittsburgh 7 and N9 0 and3 in the ACC Neither coach has been happy with the way their teams have started games lately Can that change tonight for one or the other or both with Georgia Tech in the manto man and pit missed Caleppa wide open on the inside Speaking of missing Barry Dunning cheering Jr misfires from three Georgia Tech starting five No Moila tonight He went through shootound gingerly Hes got the boot on his foot So Jaden Mustaf makes his 10th start And that was awkward and it was a travel and Vango turns it over Well it was really only three steps So I mean laughter NBA thats a good play Jeff Cable starting five today chooses to keep Brandon Cummings coming off the bench after the 29point game on Saturday Miner Witherspoon Dunning Corhen and the Australian Caleppa And we trade travels in the opening 64 seconds Well thats why you want your big guys to play inside You dont want your big guys dribbling the ball out on the perimeter And speaking of big guys Coran has to stay out of foul trouble Pit is not very deep at all And Corhan is the one guy that cant afford to get in any kind of foul trouble at all When you watch these two teams play you see how much of a struggle it is just TO GET THERES A GOOD GOING BASELINE Just as I start to say that he makes a great play and just dunks on everybody The freshman from Marietta announcing his presence on a Wednesday night He had seen enough hesitation Corin straight away comes up short Mustaf bobbles the rebound but secures it Now Corin can actually shoot that three Fleming looking inside His pass disrupted and stolen Caleppa knocks down the triple When you struggle to score thats what you want to do Get it down the court and get a really good shot that way Well Georgia Tech really struggled with turnovers against Miami Baseline jumper No good Here comes freshman Omari Witherspoon Sets up Miner Miner Nice move off the dribble Shoots and hits the three over Reeds Good defense but a little better offense But Pitt was able to get that defensive rebound and get down the court quickly So its like you were talking about Jim you wanted to play before the defense gets set Reeves cant answer And last touch by Pit out of bounds Pit has shot well in the first half of games recently but they really struggled in the second half Really struggled Its just good ball movement The defense cant react back in time And this is I I Reeves just gets caught with the dribble Hes worried about Miner driving past him Thats really a good shot and a tough shot Here are those numbers in ACC play Shooting 42 from three in the first halves four of 37 11 in the second half of games Theyve blown some leads They had a lead Pit has in two of their three ACC games at the half Couple misses for Georgia Tech and here come the Panthers Bullet pass inside Tough catch and Coran able to finish for two Theyve had that D inside a couple times They they found him that time Well he did a great job running the court Corhan coming off a 40minute game Hes third in the league in minutes Dongo cannot finish Coran the rebound P looking to run Corhand fills the lane Time out Damon Dtomire maintain that lead So the run is good Now you have to build on the run If youre pitting and if youre Georgia Tech you got to get into it Yellow Jackets just one for six Got a couple offensive rebounds but dont have any second chance points to show for it applause Well Pit that time at Caleppa thats a really nice job He knocked it off dongo out of bounds And the the ruling is Pit ball Yes And thats thats the correct ruling They got one right Holy cow Close one But Pit Pit has played very hard defensively They have contested Georgia Tech shot and theyve gotten some easy ones on the offensive end Thats a pretty good formula Miner brings it back outside Brandon Cummings coming off 29point game against Cuse Offensive rebound Roman Caleb Theres a second chance bucket Well you got to be able to squeeze that defensive rebound and Georgia Tech just couldnt do it Georgia Tech stays cold See Alfa has the miss but that thats a long contested three early in the shot clock I dont think at this point in the game thats really what you need if youre the Yellow Jackets Cam Craft and Chaz Kelly The first Yellow Jackets off the bench for Damis Damire tonight Acrobatic move Cummings unable to finish Craft the rebound And here comes Kesi Reeves Sets up Washington Hell take it They needed that Oh stands the same Dummies has missed two really difficult shots that he made the last game So see how his confidence goes now But you miss a shot like that that allows the opponent to get out and go And not only was he laying on the floor for a while he spent some time yelling at the referee and that left Washington wide open And it does you no good Shot clocks winding down Pits got four to shoot Corand from the elbow Offensive rebound Dunning and helps reset the show for the Pit Panthers NICE MOVE OFF THE DRIBBLE BARRY DUNNING JR P just looks so much more confident so much stronger Another kind of possession where theres no rhythm for Georgia Tech Well the balls got to move Moving for Pittsburgh Corins got six I tell you whats moving for Pittsburgh is Corin applause Dan Bonner you almost got a Panther in your lap No that was that was a great save by Jeff Cable He grabbed him and prevented him from coming over here on the table and injuring the old the two old guys And the two old guys werent even moving yet Thats how slow their reactions were This is Bit out and running and theyre doing a really good job thus far Im not sure if they qualify your seated spot here as a legal guarding position Reeves sets up Marshall in off the Georgia Tech bench Washington cheering cant make it two in a row Second chance here Cali straightaway three Every time you tip it out to the other team they make a three You dont want to tip that ball out You want to get a piece of bring it down Little teardrop goes for Randon Cummings You get the idea that Cumins has some confidence in his offensive game What makes you say that laughter He could be three for three He missed two but they were really close and good shots Marshall travels The ball is just not moving on the offensive end for Georgia Tech Theres one dribble and you make a tough pass or one dribble and you shoot or a guy dribbles around and shoots And Georgia Techs got to get the ball moving Got to get players moving They got to try to get a stop so they can get out and get down the down the court Four turnovers already for the Yellow Jackets Starters face told the story Noitis a guy whos been struggling offensively and he tr Thats what happens when one guy dribbles the ball for 8 10 seconds and has nothing and then still go Inditis is a guy who they were hoping would provide a little spark off the bench for them but Indraitus has not made any shots at all in ACC play Hes 0 for the ACC so far Field goals threepoint field goals free throws They could really use some offense from here Washington over two defenders Tip from Marshall would not fall Another chance for the sevenfooter and Pittsburgh clears it There he goes And Cummings is crafting trying to pack it and lost it again Hes talking to the ref still And here they are the other coming down to score Thats three missed layups in the last three shots Look at a foul going against Barry Dunn already scored tonight Well they only play eight times Well its hard for those other guys to score because they havent taken a shot yet So you Its difficult Can Georgia Tech find some rhythm on offense Thatll work It does work Its kind of a busted play but it did work Well that ball sort of went by two or three Panthers in the lane They couldnt pick it up And how many times Jim does that happen You miss one and then the other guys go and get it Yeah And they score Two for Kesi Reeves Jr cheering Indrrisitis unable to find the range Cant break through Thought it was going in Marshall Thats really good interior defense without fouling Uhoh Seal up Oh big guy lost his man Its a heck of an offensive rebound at midcourt from Indraitus I thought that ball was going in the first row Indraitus comes up short again Hes not bashful though looking for his offense Chaz Kelly the third Cant cash in the three Mullen the rebound The seven foot freshman And Mullens got some important minutes to play because you cant play Cororehand for 40 minutes every game like he did in the last game Pull up jumper wont fall for Dun Reeves going baseline Bumped on the way and then turns it over And then Pittsburgh turns it over right back Hand grabbed for three Another rebound for the freshman Mullen That was a pinball play wasnt it Well you got to grab the ball Everybodys trying to dribble it Grab it first When was the last time you went to an arcade and played some pinball Jim Two days ago I have one in my basement Sopranos pinball machine I got you there Thats fantastic Barry Dunning knocks down the three But Id love to hear more about your home arcade Really cool When Julie doesnt want to talk to me she sends me down there which is frequent Craftines the range and knocks down the three Thats what Craft does He has struggled a little bit recently shooting the three but he is a pretty good threepoint shooter in the starting lineup for much of the season This is his fifth straight game coming off the bench Georgia Tech in his own Yeah zone Look I like it I recognize that right away Of course you do Intritis is the zone buster That thats it Thats why you cant play zone anymore Some guy that hasnt scored all year in the league makes a three Now would you tell Damon Statamire dont lose confidence Stay in it Hes not going to make two in a row I would but its hard for coaches that play manto man to do this Pton Marshall finally throws it down See that was a mistake by Mullen going for the steel Hes got to just play between Marshall and the basket Marshalls not really a good ball handler or an outside shooter Doming shakes his defender Heres Dunning Hes fouled A mistake from DeMarco Miner Think of all the plays in basketball one one or two is fouling a threepoint shooter Especially a guy thats not that good a threepoint shooter You know what are you doing This is what youre talking about And its hard because youre jumping up in the air but youre not going straight up Youre jumping at the guy and its just hard to to stop And youll get to the line soon cheering cheering Dunning Jr at the line for three Barry Dunning One of three players playing in this game tonight that scored over 40 points in a conference game last year Dunning did it 46 for South Alabama against Texas State Lamar Washington on 40 on uh against Washington State Cam Craft did it as well Coming up next our triple header rolls on Maples Pavilion with the Cardinal hosting Caleb Wilson at number 14 North Carolina with Roxy Bernstein and Miles Simon And well cap off the night with a wooden award front runner Cameron Boozer leading sixth ranked Duke against Cal at Hos Pavilion both games on the network and on the ESPN app West Durham and 3D Dennis Scott Georgia Tech legend are out in Berkeley for the night cap Late night for Wes and Dennis Great basketball games Cal and Stanford are better this year Itll be good games And theres some great freshman in college basketball right now We saw Bua Cory for Stanford last Wednesday night What a special player he is Good luck to Good luck to the Tar Hills guarding him Good luck to the Cardinal guarding Caleb Wilson Well yeah Okay you got me there Well its its amazing to give him a little sign Still boy and he may give him a little sign Vango has been quiet so far Maybe even silent would be a better term He misses his first shot right there Pittsburgh is doing a really good job defensively on the offense side or Georgia Techs not getting the ball combination of back to the manto man Cummings another teardrop Hes got that shot down He I mean hes really good and hes really clever of getting by Hes very sneaky Hes right by you Largest lead for the Panthers and it might grow here in transition Miner tosses it up Corhan lays it in Thats great positioning by Coran but Miner makes a really good play He had a chance to take it all the way and flipped it up to his big guy Seven straight for Pit Craft able to squaltch the run Craft has made some contributions off the bench and Georgia Tech really looking for offense Even after that make Georgia Tech still shooting below 30 Got a lot of guys that like to attack downhill off the dribble Indraitis pull up He was fouled by Craft Damon Starttomire with a look on his face like you just fouled a guy who hadnt made a shot in ACC play before a few minutes ago Yeah you just you dont want to foul jump shooters or threepoint shooters A nice job defensively to make him pull up cuz Pit really lo does like to take the ball and get to the basket cheering First foul on Lamar Washington Noas Indritis played 89 minutes at Iowa State last year So Jeff Cable has said hes kind of like a freshman He was shooting 37 from three before his recent stretch where he missed them all He just made two free throws and he was 0 for five from the line in conference play coming in Its a positive sign for Pittsburgh if they can get some production out of him But Georgia Tech for as poorly as theyve played and theyre down 16 theres still plenty of time left in this first half They just have to take better shots and keep grinding away But there are certainly some common threads with the sloppiness you saw from Georgia Tech in the first half of Miami Stunning to the pass Another timeout call by Damon Style I think theyre theyre they announced the foul on Lamar Washington before but that was clearly on Craft So Craft with one Washington with no fouls but uh thats really you got to reach high for the silver linings for Georgia Tech right there Oh look at this hustle Miner knocks it out of bounds but hes really in Reevess business Reeves is a guy whos really good off the dribble but hes Georgia Tech doing a little too much dribbling right at the moment Theyve got to move the ball move the defense and then attack off the dribble Javi Raagan the freshman from Germany whos only played five games all season getting some early minutes here as Damon Statamire searches for answers Raagan with a nice pass and a late whistle but I think the correct call Yeah absolutely I dont like that late whistle Theyll call the foul when it happens Its on Calefa his first Well they were able to get the defense to move That drive into the lane causes the defense to collapse and creates a situation where Reeves can get the ball Reeves is averaging over 18 points per game in ACC play And look Georgia Tech has been competitive in They certainly were competitive at Duke Well they have been competitive but there have been games where theyve gotten off to poor starts and then they battle they battle back the whole time and sometimes they just cant get all the way back You know they came back and had chance against Syracuse Good hustle here Washington the steel takes IT FROM WITHERSPOON HE GETS TWO SEE THATS thats too much dribbling in a oneonone situation by Witherspoon They move the ball they score They dribble they usually dont score Theres another one right on Q Witherspoon does bail him out by knocking down the jumper They get lucky Its Its nice to get lucky once in a while 3721 under five minutes to play in the first half So you got to get the ball to the other side of the court Moving Washington bounce pass looking for Carowak He wasnt ready for it And then Calefa dribbles through the traffic and turns it over Reeves dribbles through the traffic and loses it but he got lucky and hell get it back Deflected out of bounds by Pittsburgh Youd like to say good defense but I think its really poor really poor offense Well you got to capitalize as Pit has done for the most part in the first half on those transition opportunities because if you miss them that gives your opponent the opportunity to get out and go the other way Another difficult bounce passes to Kira And again they lose the ball in transition Its a pickup game right now Reeves going back to the line I think the pickup players would be very upset with you You and I channeling different pickup games Thats for sure Well this is a situation youre 7 foot guy You just cant throw him the ball down there Its a low bounce pass and hes still rolling Hes 10 ft from the basket Whats he going to do if he does catch it Hes laughter Thats a Thats a good point Free throw in and out for Reeves Caleppa did just pick up his second foul Hell find a spot on the bench But again Pit is not deep and so foul trouble is something they cannot afford And Caleeppa has played very well Hes got a couple of steals Hes made a couple of baskets Feels like everybody has a couple of steals Well thats true You got me there They dont but it feels that way It does It does feel that way So now Georgia Tech with some pressure and Pit has their two point guards in the game This is a relatively small PT lineup particularly a small back court Four minutes to play in the half Cummings double Somebodys open Cummings Difficult awkward shot Decent defense from Raagan Dangerous pass Excellent hustle and Indraitis was fouled by Kuisi Reeves There is a frantic pace to this first half music cheering 1 in the corner CC Network huddle crew having with Miamis run hanging on the sidelines during the quarters semis and finals at these college football cathedrals Well this is why Pit is having fun and uh why Georgia Tech is not Those numbers tell the story Thats a pretty good summation Pit has not been perfect by any means Demarco Miner misses that three and Carowick grabs the rebound Carowick getting a lot of minutes here and we havent seen by Dongo for a while Well I think that Damon Starter is not pleased with the way Dongo has been playing Lacy Reeves no Carowak got a tip but could not convert Miner into the fourourt intricitis Hes back Wow He heard us talking about it That is a huge lift for the Pit Panthers Thats why they got him so he could make those type of shots He had been 0 for12 in ACC play from field goal percentage wise before tonight Answer from David Remagan Its his fifth bucket of the season for Remagan the freshman from Germany whos the great nephew of Ple An answer for Pittsburgh coming showing he can make something beyond the teardrop Hes full of confidence Theres Pit continuing to switch everything while Reeves is getting more active Thats a goender Well Reeves did a great job They tried to switch and he went to the basket and that I mean thats good ball movement The ball went from one side to the other and then they got it to Reeves going to the goal Reeves has seven but the deficit is still 17 How about this 43 point counting first half for the Pit Panthers Cummings dishes to the corner Ding missed the three Rebound Carow Georgia Tech looking downhill Washington takes it Boy when the ball doesnt go in its not fun Yeah its the game is much easier when the ball goes in the basket That was a good shot Good transition shot Pit really likes to take the ball and attack off the dribble Cam Coran with a look of determination Intrasitis the stick back 10 first half points for Noius Intracitis get rejected Anditis comes up with the loose ball Dont want to stand up and risk a travel Smart play Timeout Jeff Cable 22 on the shot clock 43 Well hes covered and he turns it over And two things happen The guard doesnt want to throw it in there or hes not very good at it and knows it And if he throws it away the coach is going to be mad at halftime at him Pit might see it again About a 2 and 12 second difference game and shot clock And a foul given by Demarco Miner Its his second Big foul charge for number seven Demarco Miner Take your pardon Thats his first They changed one of them Only one foul on Miner See a left for the only Panther with two Pit still has another foul to give but Im not sure you want to do this with so few players One thing you have to do is make sure the referees know you are going to foul They will then look for it which didnt happen the Notre Dame game against Cal Fourpoint shot Oh Whoa I forgot they didnt have fouls Grabbed to Carow and hes fouled with two seconds left And to your point Dan which is a really good one thats three fouls picked up by three different PIT players on this possession You want to foul and you think youre going to get the clock down You almost did Its great strategy and when it works its great When it doesnt work it just doesnt work Minor and Cummings each picked up their first and Dunning just picked up his second Its probably not that bad of a foul to foul Kurak Hes Well hes 0 for three now in his career Chad but it also doesnt look like its going in laughter Well you can witness history His first collegiate made free throw Sorry but theres a foul Is that on Cor Thats his second foul Hes picked up two fouls Theyre not going to give you a call but theyre going to at least let you know The one thing I always hated when they come over and say you know I missed that call coach Thanks They missed the front end of the one and one So other than the foul on Corin no harm done And that takes Pittsburgh 6 for 10 from three in the first half as well But Georgia Tech started poorly against Syracuse and battled all the way back in the game Lets see if they can do the same thing They got to get going early Yeah By Dongo only played nine minutes in the first half and did not score He is out there to start the second half Reeves cannot carve into the deficit down and grabs the rebound And that thats a tough shot and that shot clock is running down They didnt really get very much out of that But if those are the kind of shots Reeves is going to shoot hes going to have a tough night Hes two for eight after that miss Miner kicks it Thea front rims it rebound Fleming Really good sequence Just missed the shot Kai Fleming with another miss That was an odd looking shot I thought he was thinking about passing it to Dongo and then he just changed his mind Two points for Witherspoon He made his only shot Dishes to Dunning Offensive rebound Caleppa Witherspoon reloads This has been Pits trouble when they move the ball they get really good looks and they dont make the threes All Georgia Techs got to do is score which has been very hard and Im not sure that they can That was the third foul on Caleppa And so suddenly now Pittsburgh which wasnt very big to begin with gets much smaller Georgia Tech hasnt been able to take advantage with Dongo inside So its really it probably helps their offense Moila is out tonight And Georgia Techs got nothing from Dongo Can he change that here Well hes fouled and thats going to be number three Three on Dunning Two on Dunning excuse me They mixed and matched him two Reeves flips it inside Dongle over Coren Strong rebound by Cororehead Pit staff wanted a foul on the board cheering Panthers have missed their first three shots in the second half We showed you the graphic earlier of their first half Second half threepoint disparity Theres a goal 10 and a two credited for Brandon Cummings All they did was get the ball back to the other side Hit a drive opportunity Well Im telling you Pit really likes to drive the ball and Cumins when he gets it hes going to the basket And the reason they like to drive the ball I think is they dont shoot very well So they they need to drive the ball and Georgia Tech does too No good for Reeves Dango on the glass He looks He looks very lethargic He just doesnt look with his normal movement Maybe he had a bad night last Who knows You never know You never know Witherspoon Nice shot Thats Thats a good shot Get down Get the little two Theres nothing wrong with a twopoint pullup if youre not a good shooting team Yep Yep Yep Foul Miner raised his hand Are they giving it to him Yes Panthers foul charged the number seven Number two on Demarco Miner 13 foul Thats just a really really nice drive He gets stopped You drive the defender back with the dribble and then you go straight up in the air A guy whos rounding out his game Hes really shot the ball well the last few weeks Eight of his last 15 from three coming into tonight Heres Mustafa Tough two You get better ball movement Georgia Tech did that time A little better This guys not sharp Offcourt taking control bounce passes to big guys in the lane and theyre in traffic too Hes got the angle Take the ball and score Thats what he does As you were just saying hes looking for a shot Id rather see him take his shot than make that pass If he takes a shot Corhams in pretty good position for a rebound Dondo too strong with a left stay with it and a foul called inside Jeff Cable thought it was a jump ball just like Barry Dunning Well I think Jeff Cable also thought that a Kai Fleming went over somebodys back in there Thats number three on Dunning So here comes Noise and Droitis back in So Dunning is trying to get the jump ball but hes got a lot of arm in there mostly Washington had nowhere to go Well defended by the Panthers They got an advantage here Cor I never like that pass when you throw it to a guy from be thats behind you a big guy and hes got to go that far Youre setting him up to charge At least it wasnt a bounce pass though Yeah he caught it cheering Now you got to have your position established before the guy plants that last foot Yeah And he just didnt get there Thats another rule We were talking with one of the referees before the game and the rules are so hard this year Timeout rules and so many things just dont fit the college game very well Corhen makes them both and he joins incitis and Dunning in double figures They all have 10 Four minutes into the second half by Dongo has showed up P has continued to switch those screens and finally Dongo has taken advantage of the mismatch that those screens create Those switches create Hes hes they need to run that every time Throw up the ball Thats their best opportunity best chance to score And if pit doubles then maybe theyll get an open look Feet in the post Corand for two Boy thats a great ending pass by Andrew Sid Really good Fleming gives it up Washington looking back door knocked away Itll be Pittsburgh ball Stay up late like coach Beheim and watch the 11 pm Well watch them all and then go to the airport Pittsburgh slow start to the second half They missed their first three shots but they have responded They made their last three field goal attempts Panthers looking for their first ACC win of the season Air ball there from Brandon Cummings They have played at their best when they have gotten movement and there wasnt a lot of movement You know uh Cumins bounced the ball way too much before they even started to try to do anything No action on that And at this end for Georgia Tech its just been a strange bizarre evening for the most part Good hands there from Intracitis Well part of it is good defense Give some credit for sure They have played very aggressively And the thing theyve done particularly aggressively Jim youve talked about it Theyre switching everything And if youre going to do that you have to be aggressive because if youre not then the other team can take advantage But their aggressiveness has really disrupted the Georgia Tech offense taking them out of everything theyre doing Speaking of aggressive this guy not sure why actually get Cummings there but he got called for the foul His first Cummings was trying to push off is back in as is Chaz Kelly Chaz Kelly has played pretty well in recent games for Georgia Tech off the bench and they need a spark like that tonight Here he comes Cummings two more You better get in front of him because if you dont hes going past you Hes the fourth Panther Panther in double figures and Cam Craft answers from the corner His second three of the night Cam Craft is a guy who scored 40 points in a division one college basketball game before So if he gets hot look out Well you got you got to make him dribble the ball Different levels Grounding out this time for Cummings Craft the rebound Washington had 12 assists at Miami on Saturday Thats his third assist of the night tonight Thats a tough play against pretty good defense but they were able to drive the ball inside Cam Coran throws it down How about the game Andrew Situs has happened Thats a couple of assists now Hes a different player than what hes been so far in the league Jeff Cable has insisted to anyone who would listen Nice block there by Coran ongo that Indraitis is a good player that had just lost his confidence and said we need him Pittsburgh playing with great confidence tonight That wasnt a steal That was a blocked shot But again you get the block shot you keep it in play That gives you transition opportunity And Pit continues to make Georgia Tech pay in transition This is Georgia Techs largest deficit of the entire season Dongo spinning through traffic and gets to the free throw line Thats foul charges You have to admire Dongos aggressiveness but he had five guys from And heres Pit off and running again Defense cant get set That guy is I mean hes been very dangerous over the last two games You got to get out to him Don go just he just look he just doesnt have any energy it seems like to me watch him he just hit 26 against Syracuse and he was moving all over the court they didnt call the foul on Corhen its his third again you know its its three Panthers with three fouls theres still a lot of time left in the game Mullen I thought made a big contribution in the first half He didnt score but he had a couple of rebounds in four minutes and allowed Cororehand to take some time on the bench I think hes going to have to play well here in the second half One of the common things weve heard from Damon Statamire is that his players need to get lost in the little things Focus Well they are lost They just I teed that one up for you I know I I didnt take I feel bad But you know theyre just they make too many mistakes and theyre not doing anything good on offense and its theyre not getting good shots initis How about the offensive rebound from Mullen And it will stay P ball He battled for it Well he did and that was the key because he battled for it Georgia Tech couldnt squeeze it And so now Pit gets the ball again Tough spot to inbound but he gets it into Cummings Miner saw crease kicks it Cummings resets and rebound for reset right now Too much going to make too much off to crab Good close out by Witherspoon Thats what you do You need to make craft dribble Oh here you go Finds a PIT PANTHER AND ITS BRANDON CUMMINGS Pit coaches were saying how was it over the back and they get a free two from it But just a lack of concentration there by Georgia Tech There were three guys None of them picked up the ball and Cummings took it And theyre going to call that reachin foul on Cummings He clearly got a lot of ball He smacked it away Thats usually not a foul Thats number two on Brandon Cummings And it takes us to the under 12 timeout with 1107 to play Brandon Cummings had 29 on Saturday and a loss but hes got six He blocked the shot Hes pretty talented Oh boy Remember Stamford only won two ACC road games last year One of them was at Cal The other was in Chapel Hill at the Dean Dome Theyre improved Both both California teams are improved Tech goes inside Dongo He forces it up and gets the bounce to go his way Oh I thought Mullen did a pretty good job Just made a better play Might have gone Pittsburgh still leads by 21 points Cummings is their leading scoreer tonight And Andrew Situss offense off the bench has been a huge bonus Well that was really disjointed until the end Till the end He made a nice pass and but also it was set up He he made a nice cut to the open space and got an open shot and made it Thats what you have to do sometimes Dongo gets two more Hes got all eight of his points here in the second half Well Coran is out of the game because hes got three fouls and Dongo has a real advantage in there Now 10 points for Dongo Ill correct myself That wasnt going to go anywhere good for Pittsburgh but Georgia Tech with the pressure Pit didnt react very well to it Cummings tried to give the take foul They didnt foul it Georgia Tech gets the three from Chaz Kelly The third Long way to go Too much probably too much to overcome but you got to get give them a fight and thats what theyre going to try to do Cummings tries to fire for three Thats the danger of trying to press that if you get the ball if your opponent gets the ball down the court quickly they get an advantage situation they get an open three and you have to run it Kelly make somebody else shoot the ball Three for Georgia Tech Craft in double figures And Jeff Cape was not happy with that Hes telling his players they got to make Craft dribble the ball cheering Next whistle the three Panthers with three fouls are coming back Cummings rejected by Dongo Outlet pass deflected but caught by Kelly anyway Three could have cut it to 16 but he misfired Got to keep fighting Thats what Georgia Techs doing How you feel about that shot Oh good shot Open shot at transition The whistle man Offensive foul Foul on Kieran Mullen for the illegal screen Back of the floor Dunning and Caleppa are all back in all with three fouls If youre Georgia Tech you have to continue to attack And those guys with three fouls they they know they have to be a little bit less aggressive And so Georgia Tech has a window here Theres a long way to go but theres still enough time left in the game Well you got to just take it in 3 4 minute period They got to try to cut it down to 10 or 12 And thats not going to be easy but that might help Found it Hes on FIRE RIGHT NOW FOLKS They knew that was going knew that was going out of the timeout Perfect screen Wide open More pressure from the Yellow Jackets and just getting it across before the 10 count Alioop style pass from Cummings from the backboard to get it over Shot clocks down to nine How about the night that Noas Intricitus has put together Well that was a big big shot cuz you could feel the momentum maybe starting to switch Indraitus matching his season and careerhigh and he had never scored in an ACC basketball game before tonight We get ourselves a timeout with 744 to go Georgia Tech making a charge thanks to Cam Craft but Noius Intrasitis money His fourth three of the night Weve been struggling until tonight Georgia Tech gets it in and Dono fouled by Corin who cannot believe the whistle Thats four Cant let him get position inside there Wow coach Well and if you do let him get position you got to understand that you got to you cant foul him You got to step back Yeah You just cant let him get back And thats thats something that you know the referees are looking for that you put your hands straight up near but you move your hips into the guy Youre not fooling anybody Thats the one place I like their zone defense the most is underout score and you see people score all the time in this game Well now Pit has elected to go very small Your guy going to play in the post is the 66 in Caleeppa Better ball handlers I hope thats what theyre thinking Its good Get the ball down get good shots Get some three open threes Time cheering out Pittsburgh Georgia Tech with some good pressure in the basket Well we played Arizona in 95 and they beat him I believe So he didnt get 45 against you So he didnt get 45 They got another trap They almost got it Pitch gets it across just in time Cummings just gets a call though Its a stop for the Jackets You cant take tough shots like that You You need to beat the press You have to make them pay for pressing you Good hands from Injit as his fine night continues And then Dunning fortunate to get that to go cuz Jeff Cable was ready to erupt if he dropped it out of bounds Well there was a good hand down there but it was holding Georgia Tech player Thats the only problem Hit back up 19 Crab short Indraitis active As memorable as those two January 14th scoring games were for Damon This is random but Georgia Tech hasnt won a basketball game in their last six tries on January 14th Theyve lost their last six games on this day on the calendar Who finds that stuff out People with a lot of time on their hands Jim Intrasitis Not this time Rebound for Ramagan Now you got to stop You got to get a score Little spin a dish and Dongo had it just lodged out of bounds Itll be Georgia Tech ball Those are the plays youve got to make You catch the ball down there and you let a guy knock it away You got to grab it turn and dunk it Its just hes off tonight just physically and mentally Good defense on Craft forcing him to dribble He has trouble when he has to dribble Thats why coach Cap was saying make him put it on the floor Feels good as a coach when they listen Yes Now if youre pit you dont want to get overly conservative here Shot clock down to set Miner A good rebound Robin CPA IN SEVEN COUNTS applause cheering I mean Georgia Tech has tried to go with a smaller lineup to match the pit smaller lineup but Georgia Tech doesnt have anybody in the game that can deal with that guy inside No theyre trying to pressure and trying to get steals and thats what thats what youre trying to do Pittsburghs got pretty good ball handlers too Theyre making some mistakes but theyre not going to make enough Really nice job by Caleppa moving his feet right there to pick It doesnt work With a beautiful pass Lays it in Jimmy Reeves lays it in resting Foul in the back court on Mustaf Thats only the fourth team foul against Georgia Tech They can afford to be very aggressive And what makes that play is Raagan is able to get past the perimeter defense and you break down that defense you force people to come and help you create those kinds of plays only had three assists all season Hes got two tonight Ticking toward 5 minutes left here in Atlanta Four different Panthers in double figures Cummings leading the way Caleeppa on his way You cant do anything with him down there Hes just too physical 66 220 lbs Whoa Intritis down hard tumbling over Kesi Reevess shoulders Well he fell right on his tailbone Foul charge number 25 The foul was on him but it adds literally insult to injury when youre announced for the foul and youre the one down on your back Yeah Well thats why they call it hardwood Its not a good place to fall Hes pretty tough too Substitution for the Panther is number two Cameron Cor Its been a good night for Noyas 22 minutes off the bench 16 points five of nine four of six from three Also got four rebounds three assists and one active defensively when Pit got him out of the portal Thats the kind of thing they were hoping that he would be able to do Not score 16 points every night but to give him a spark off the bench and he certainly has done that tonight Got some blood on his arm Battle wound The arms going to feel okay That backside might hurt Back of the floor Bongos coming back in fellas 438 to play in a 19point game Panthers still have to handle the ball here Only turned it over eight times Three in the second half Theres number four in the second half Number nine overall You know when youre going to commit a turnover you shouldnt do it when youre standing right in front of your coach Better to throw it out of bounds and throw it to the other team inbounds Silver Liners whatever youre doing not right in front of the coach You make good plays right in front of the coach Two more ACC games coming up tonight here on the network David Raman short now That time he wasnt able to get past the defense Pit sees control early and they just havent lost it They just run the plays run the offense If they score they score If they dont it doesnt matter Just run the clock out reach and foul on Raaggin will reset the shot clock physical and hurt them inside The other thing is the Panthers they come into this game shooting 25 as a team from threepoint range in conference play They made a total of 17 threes in the first three games Theyve made 10 tonight Their fifth time this season make double digit threes Shot clock winding down Caleppa another rebound And thats a goalend So CP is in a double figures and hes closing in on a double double You know its not like hes built like George McGinness or somebody I mean but he uses his body very very well Strong player He embraces contact cuz he grew up playing rugby Rugby physical sport Boy theres another steal Georgia Techs 15th turnover and the 12th steal by the Panthers I dont know if its fair to say they lead the ACC in turnovers or their last in the ACC in turnovers Either way its not good Tough finish there Cummings with 21 on the night Pit just has been the aggressor all night long And Georgia Tech now backing off a little bit Yellow Jackets head up to Raleigh for a new tip off against Will Wades Wolfpack on Saturday Team that likes to push it and score points Not a good team for Georgia Tech Pack off tonight Well and theres another steal Its hard to call them steals cuz they almost are just giving them the ball So I dont know Theres no category for gift Thats like if the bank gift category if the bank robber didnt have to even go in They just brought them out the money I mean I dont know if thats stealing Pit had a season high 14 steals against Bingmpington They got 12 steals tonight Its their second most in a game this season Number eight But Georgia Tech and you know they they cut it to 17 and it looked like they had a little momentum Theres a foul topppa Thats his fourth Well its academic now but Georgia Tech made a little bit of a run but then Situs hit a big three and that stopped it Its got to be very frustrating for Damon Starttomire that you know his guys they much like they did against Syracuse they just started very very slowly and as youve mentioned theyve competed very well against some of the top teams in the conference but you know this is just this was not their this is not the kind of performance Dire was looking for the gymnastic IC season is underway and this is our first ACC Network meet Sunday afternoon Number 13 Stanford squares off against number 11 North Carolina Carmichael Arena in Chapel Hill Coverage begins 4 Eastern 1 Pacific Its also available on the ESPN app I going to say get ready for the Olympics by watching some ACC gymnastics Of course its the winter Olympics that are coming up and the gymnastics didnt start either No And and Lindsey Vaughn is winning events at 41 Hes like LeBron James I guess we shall see A legend Thats some pass Oh Dunning throws it down for the exclamation point for Pittsburgh cheering Dunnings got 14 Indraitis has 16 Cors got 15 Cummings 21 Caleppa 11 Well pretty nice game by Cumins coming off 29 to get 21 And he I mean he just he was aggressive from the get go You know they bring him off the bench and boy its such a luxury as a coach to be able to bring somebody off the bench thats not going to give you that kind of offense And he didnt have them tonight I mean he missed shots that he can make I mean thats how crazy it is He looks like a guy that can do this all the time Hes very shifty with the ball He gets by people He can shoot the three and hes got the floater Thats thats a pretty wellrounded game Jeff Cable talked about how he was injured over the summer Cummings and he started playing well then he rolled his ankle in practice getting ready for their third game of the year and that kind of disrupted his rhythm in nonconference Hes hes looked very good the last few games cheering Well whatever disruption that had occurred to his rhythm it appears to have been eliminated Indeed Yes 29 on Saturday 23 tonight Nobody stop patting his stats Pittsburgh just needs to get it across midcourt and take 30 seconds off the clock and get ready for a happy flight back home to face the Louisville Cardinals on Saturday night Louisvilles been a little little bit of a slide too Kelly fumbles the rebound out of bounds and in that a microcosm that is that encapsulates the night for Georgia Tech Just cant hang on to the ball when theres nobody around him That is not a steal No No Is there a giveaway Yeah its called a turnover Yeah thats true Same thing But sometimes a turnover isnt that bad Its a give a giveaway would be even worse You have to try You can eat a turn I will put you on the rules committee Dunning adds to his night Hes got 17 points now And Jeff Cable takes a timeout to get Mari Moore into the game for the first time since December 21st Freshman from Ipsellani Michigan Well he takes out Minor Miner had a really solid game tonight You know he did not give give up the ball He had six assists He only scored three points but he just really did a really nice job handling the ball Second chance for Georgia Tech but time is short Pittsburgh going to improve to 542 when they score 80 under Jeff Cable Theyve won their last 31 games when they score 80 and the shot clock is up Pretty impressive defense from Pit tonight They did a really good job keeping people in front of him and they made some really nice plays especially transition basketball Cool handshake with Indraitis and Cable A cathartic performance tonight for the Pit Panthers as they shoot 53 on the road make 11 threes and win by 23 over Georgia Tech Very impressive performance
