uh hes done an outstanding job here in Miami 12th season with the Kanes 39th season overall our officials tonight Roger Ayers AJ Desai and Doug sermons jumping it up and winning the tip will be North Shadow Amir for Miami in the white jerseys Saint Francis of Brooklyn in the blue look for Miami to do a lot of dribble Drive Music as Nigel packed us just that to start the scoring well they really want to pack the basket thats their motto this year Music Saint Francis playing without Rob Higgins their senior preseason allleague selection he is out today with an upper body injury did not play in the second half of their last game against Saint Peters he averages about six points a game and leads the team in assist tedrick Wilcox High arching three is good Wilcox a senior from Pawtucket Rhode Island he is a really good threepoint shoot and one of the things Saint Francis has to figure out do they make adjustments to play this Miami team or do they run the things that they normally going to run once they get in the conference play keep an eye on for the Hurricanes down low omir mismatched fouled Music no traveling called against omir I see in a much smaller defender on him he didnt get his feet set that time but you can see Miami and Miami is really trying to integrate him into their offense Francis comes in two and two victories over a division three School Mount Saint Mary and then St Peters of note Saint Francis is playing back to back Elite eight participants which you wouldnt quite anticipate but St Peters and Miami both made it all the way to the elite eight last year lost is on the road at Minnesota and at St Thomas of Minnesotas the long threes Off the Mark Harris follows it up and in you know at shoot around today coach Lara Naga told his team we have to generate our own energy you know its Thanksgiving the students are away I dont know how many fans were going to get we have to get off to a quick start we have to get our own energy going in this building tonight so the rim Poplar crazy shot rebounded by the Terriers pushing in transition up ahead Moreno off class and hell go to the line and this is exactly the kind of start that Glenn brinka and Saint Francis wanted get out build some confidence without question they feel Saint Francis really feels like they can attack but this Miami team is not as big as last years team and last years team had a trouble rebounding the ball but they made it up with their defensive pressure turnovers and they got the easy baskets coach Lara Naga is trying to get this Miami team to fall in line the same way Larry Marino nine out of nine from the freethrow line this season a fifth year senior from Brooklyn comes off a 19point game against Saint Peters Applause Saturday it was six out of eight from the field in that game and he has given Saint Francis a fivepoint lead early this thing Francis team is not going to back down they played against tough competition you see they come out with some cool cooked pressure just the way they normally like to play once they get in the league play this is Nigel packing the Kansas State transfer highlight sought after in the portal a third year sophomore Isaiah Wong the star of last years NCAA tournament run rebounded by Harris Music Applause Music Roy Clark has the ball he got the start in place of Higgins the injured point guard Miami will try to get in the passing Lane look for Saint Francis try to take advantage of that nice lead from Moreno to Cyrus Grigsby for a score and its nine to two early in favor of the Terriers Applause pack Ill shoot a three Music and the rebound track down eventually by Saint Francis and Roy Clark right now Saint Francis is able to play at a pace where they can execute and run their offense inside hook shot is Off the Mark for Grisby rebound fought four pack comes away with it for the Kings running one on three pack forcing the issue and he draws the foul great move there by Pat instead of trying to fade away from the defense he went into the defense and actually created the contact and was able to get to the line Nigel pack was first team all Big 12 last year we talked about the couple of transfers they brought in we focused on omir in the open but pack first team all Big 12 at Kansas State average 17 a game and shot 44 from Beyond The Arc one of the things coach Larry Naga told us that shoot around the day is in the fall they try to go out and get high school players when the seasons over in the spring most of the better high school players are gone so then they go into the portal and try to come up with guys that fit the way they played and pack on there both did that both widely acknowledged among the top 10 or so players in the transfer portal after last year and they both came to Miami pack breaks a 90 Saint Francis runny has all four Keynes points weve action here for the Terriers Applause Music inside for Frisbee with six on the shot clock going One on One reverse layoffs up and in Cyrus Grisby with four points whenever youre in a game like this I think you have to set the tempo defensively and I think you have to force your will on the other team right now Miami is letting Saint Francis run whatever it is that they want to run and then hoping to get a rebound Wong alleyoop knocked away from omir in a Fab Josiah Harris the foul his first Saint Francis off to the Quick Start with 230 wins at Miami coming into todays game hes one of only four coaches all time with 150 wins at three different division one schools put into perspective what kind of accomplishment that is that is a tremendous accomplishment um I knew Jim when I first got in the business and always been a basketball player hes a teacher first he really tries to inspire young people hes done a great job here at home 39th season overall 700 career victories spanning his time in American International Bowling Green George Mason and now Miami they see Miamis trapping the ball screens they have to do something that picks up the temple will Cox makes them pay hes got five points early on really been impressed with the Way Saint Francis though has been able to handle the ball and control the pace of this game this is the young man I think has to get going for Miami is wrong hes shown his ability to force his will great stuff offensively and get the ball inside Pax contested jumper goes through hes got six Wong leads the team in scoring assists and steals but hasnt gotten going so far yet to score well sometimes you know hes trying to get used to playing with packs and sometimes you have to defer any letting pack initiate the offense strong take by Moreno will earn him a trip to the line back his first see this is where the lack of size that Miami has they have to be able to compensate that because they really dont have a pure rim protector they expect Miller and popular to do a good job theyre very active Wings great athletic wings so they denied rotations and penetration but they need somebody that closes down that Rim into the game for Miami Bentley Joseph along with Anthony Walker possibly a rim protector at six foot nine thats what they hope to get out of walking thats what they hope to get out of walking his development to be able to come in there and protect that Rim is critically this is not the same Miami team that went all the way to the elite eight last year they lost a lot from that team three starters Cameron mcgusty 18 points a game First Team all ACC Charlie Moore so steady Sam wardenberg versatile post player so having to replace those pieces you dont just you dont just come five games into the season and just hit the ground running it takes time to develop that chemistry you dont and thats why you see the schedule before you get into your conference season is really important in preparing the team to get ready for the rough conference ride hopler down the lane Stripped Away and out of bounds to the Terriers Bensley Joseph uh into the game was running the point on that last possession for Miami which led briefly two to nothing in this game but watch Saint Francis going a 90 run terrorists have led ever since and theyre getting confidence I mean what you want to do is when the team comes into your building you want to try to knock them out early and not let them build some confidence and some flow trapping the ball screen trying to get Saint Francis out of what they like to do offensive foul on Cyrus Grisby is first Walker can move his feet like that great move of the feet right there through the charge that young man will get some playing time coach larenegger talked about with us earlier trying to get the bench in the game trying to get the young guys developed Zion Bethea checks into the game for Saint Francis also into the game new hot Sonia a junior big man six foot ten Miami comes in with a 41 record most recently beat Providence at Mohegan Sun and then suffered their first loss of the Season by 18 points against the very impressive Maryland team out of the Big Ten good skip pass Music wide open Joseph the three rebounded on the weak Side by Cyrus Grisby whos been very active so far Clark step back free throw line jumper Rebound in why are the Keynes nor Chad omear whos averaging a double double 14 and 10 he traveled see I think when Miami gets the basketball like that they really want to push it they really want to attack and you see coach Larry Nagin hes kind of telling them push it push it push it omir when he wants him to rebound the ball kick it to a guard gold fill the lane they call it rim run get to the front of the rim let us get you the ball lets get you an easy shot and Miami really thrived last year when they went to that sort of small ball and pushing the tempo they were devastating in transition trapped stolen away by Bensley Joseph racing in and lays it in thats one of the things Joseph defensively he comes in he really heats up the pressure Music Keynes turning up the defensive pressure against Saint Francis playing without it starting point guard tonight Rob Higgins Music feed it inside for grispy faces up shoots it from short range and the rebound comes away to Wong Music Wong down the lane lays it up in thats what long does really well he attacks the basket and you saw him that time they really did a good job of pushing the basket ESPN app seven and four Wake Forest takes on seven and four Duke in the Tobacco Road Series that dates back to 1924 its a 3 30 Eastern then at 8 Eastern the Series dates back to 19574 pit has won three straight they take on a Miami team looking to get Bowl eligible turnover for the Miami basketball team throwing it down Anthony Walker rocks the rim great defensive pressure that time by Miami this is what they have to do they have to get their offense from their defense theyre trapping that dribble hands off and creating a lot of problems with Saint Francis see what kind of adjustments glenrika can make rejected out of bounds by North Shadowmere Music great job right there you see the Trap steel kick it out finish with a flourish things AJ Casey a freshman from Chicago checks into the game Music still coming in Nigel pack for long as omir will check out of the game one of the things coach larne is working on is this rotation and trying to develop his Advance because he knows December or January its going to be really difficult more players he can get ready to play the better Miami will be rebound by Walker whos been very active since coming in off the Miss by Wilcox down the lane awkward shot in a foul densely Joseph will go to the line and thats really you want to win these games obviously thats the number one goal but you dont want to be tinkering with your rotations when youre playing Duke and Carolina you want to get those rotations and build that confidence now Im gonna tell you a secret coach is kind of a game in his schedule that they think they can Tinker with things and make some adjustments and still win and I know Joseph has made a huge impact in coming in this game defensively getting Miami back to that pressure that they like to utilize Joseph a sophomore from Arlington Mass just outside of Boston its really come on this year just about two points a game last year in 13 minutes up to six points a game early this season in about 20 minutes a game its really strong got a real strong upper body he gets up underneath the guards extremely well he keeps really good pressure on the ball came into the game shooting 56 very good to a guard and also 42 from Beyond The Arc ties the game at 15 Music Harris nice catch rejected by Casey Harris second opportunity scores good job that time by Harris we talked about him in the open as far as really how well he plays around the basket he has to be a fourth tonight first year at St Francis Ford Josiah Harris played in Hutchinson Community College out in Kansas came into the game averaging 10 points and 10 and a half rebounds a game down the lane Walker Tipsy do rebound Zion Bethea Music foreign Music Applause staffs calling out for no ball screens threepointer is up and short rebounded by the Kings the Miami has taken them out of those ball screens by doubling them threepointer is good quick trigger from Nigel pack who has nine points thats one of the things that he agrees to this Miami team he is a really good threepoint shooter started this season very strong a 15 a game over his first two just about half that over those last three already has nine points here early splitting the double Moreno Music risby not really a threepoint shooter St Francis so used for playing awful ball screens now that Miami has taken them out of it now theyre forcing them to go oneonone which is not really their strength but theyre doing a good job on the offensive glass Miami has to clean up their offensive rebounder and that was really a weakness for Miami even in their terrific season last year yes but they were able to kind of overcome that because they were getting turnovers and and run outs off their defense so they were able to manufacture points and take away shot opportunities for their opponents Music Music especially they thought he was going to use a screen and the screen never came and packed just backed up the steps and buried the jump shot third year sophomore from Indianapolis our way of Kansas State where he spent a couple of years the big 12s most improved player last year as well we mentioned 17 a game for Pat last season risby down the lane strong take game up short on the lefthanded layup rebounded by Miami running in transition laying it up and in Walker does a great job of getting out the transition for a big and if he could do that all year and beat other bigs down the floor hes going to create a lot of easy opportunities for himself Junior from Baltimore Anthony Walker primarily a backup behind wardenberg last year in amongst the trees Roy Clark he is fouled see but I think sometimes guards get too deep that time I think Clark can be doing a good job but he got too deep not knowing what he what decision he was going to make with the basketball he got fouled and kind of got bailed out but you have to kind of know what youre going to do before you get that deep you see three Miami players are right there perhaps the only thing that can slow Nigel pack down is foul trouble that was his second foul although hell stay in the game for now and now he will check out so pack whos got 12 points already will go out with two fouls see Miami was able to get the lead with Miller popular out of the game uh and also with long so that shows you how coach laronega is trying to develop this bench so that he can get a lead and rest some of the starter to be fresh with really wear people down two free throws from Roy Clark Saint Francis is six out of six from the freethrow line so far helping them stay in this game with eight minutes left to go in the first half Music Wong turns the corner hes blocked athletic play from behind back inside laying it up and in Village kind of do everything guys from Miami a lot of people as you talk to the Miamis opponents think he is their most dangerous player because he can do so many things he can rebound he can shoot it he defends very well averaging 157 for the fifth year senior rejected long running the other way two on one along with Poplar who soars for the Raymond scores theyre used to playing together theyre playing on the same age program out of the Philadelphia area now Miamis starting to get a lot of easy baskets in transition because has fueled their run shooting 63 percent to Saint franciss 39 percent energy business Music strong take to the rim defended well that was DeAndre Howell South on the drive this is where I think Wong is really good when he change his Pace being able to get to the rim tough break for Saint Francis as it goes out of bounds to the canes six and a half left to go first half Keynes by six 10 challenge Miami will host Rutgers next Wednesday on ESPNU here at the watsco center 7 15 start we saw some of the key players to look for in that game its the femori for Rutgers will be a good matchup inside as Miamis got the ball here leading it by six cleanly played first half and an offensive foul on omir his first right now the beer and Wong have only three points between them and thats not a great recipe for Miami they need more out of those two guys one came in averaging 15 a game omir 14 a game has been largely a nonfactor so far now hes ding up on Josiah Harris who fumbled the ball out of bounds to Miami thats the way the ACC schedule is now there are usually games before the new year Miami opens its ACC schedule at Louisville on December 4th youll be there take on NC State on no uh December 10th here and of notes there are two saint franciss theres Saint Francis Brooklyn and Saint Francis Pennsylvania they will also host Saint Francis Pennsylvania here on December 17th so theyre playing both Saint franciss theyre both in the NEC I was going to let you explain that partner that is the red Flash not to be confused with the Terriers as the reverse layup wouldnt go and a strong rebound there by Roy Clark and Norman Miller finishes that at The Rim thats one of the things he does extremely well is Drive the ball and be able to use his athleticism to explode and finish tipped pass in transition leads to a turnover Believe It or Not these two schools have played relatively recently they played in 2013 here and Saint Francis won that game in overtime the only previous meeting was way back in 1963 so one a piece in this series but both these coaches were at that game coach larenega and coach breika Poplar I think he had bad intentions there to dunk that but then he changed his mind in midair hell go to the lines great move and thats the athleticism of popular and thats what Im saying I think the strength of this Miami team can be his two main guys with Papa and Miller and their ability to attack the basket and how well that theyre going to have to come back and help rebound the basketball second foul on Josiah Harris you know you talk about the Big 10 ACC matchup I remember when it first got started and it was really a thing that made you get your team ready to play early because before everybody was kind of playing at home and playing because they could beat up one and that really made just ramp up your practices and everything to get ready hey Saturday 2 30 Eastern the ACC tunnel crew will get you set for another afternoon of football at 6 30 get a complete wrapup of those games theyll get you set to The Prime Time matchup between Pitt and Miami on acc Network at eight after the game the full post game show to wrap up the night all of it right here on the ACC Network and the ESPN app two free throws for Poplar and another nope not a turnover but deflected out of bounds Joseph really when he comes in the game the defensive intensity changes and I thats why coach Larry nagan talked to us and shoot around talked about him playing and how important he was Music Saint Francis LED this game early 92 but Miamis Resurgence has coincided with their uptick in defensive intensity so really getting after St Francis on the defensive end another turnover Jordan Miller feeds it ahead for Joseph stepping into a three Poplar he got it Applause this Miami team is at its best when its in transition and the best way for it to be in transition is off of his defense awesome live ball turnover in particular coach branca told us that can have the live ball turnovers hes going to turn it over travel throw it out of bounds dont lead to a fast break Music Mourinho top of the key three well short Applause Music Coast to Coast turned away several players down behind the play Mourinho all the way to the rims crazy shot rebounded by omir they want to slow it down right now a little bit I think they really like to try to get the ball inside or run some dribble handoff stuff so they can get downhill Wong down the lane and hell go to the line Saint Francis on a scoring drought of over four minutes as Miami has taken control by 11 Carl Gables Robert Lee and the coach Perry Clark with you and Coach you mentioned getting out in transition and so many teams across the nation struggle on the half court offense now it seems like everyone wants to get out of transition and run because thats really kind of the easiest way to score in a lot of cases well it is the other part of it is a lot of these coaches have integrated new players because of the transfer portal into their lineup so theyre getting to know their players as well as their players are getting to know them and the easiest way offensively the scores get easy baskets through your defensive off the turnovers so by pushing the ball you really can help yourself offensively a great deal and Miami has utilized those easy baskets in transition as Wong missed the first to shoot 58 from the field here in the first half St Francis all the way down to 33 percent now even with this transcript portal Id like to explain it its like a blind man going into a blind room because you cant see each other you dont really know each other youve heard about each other you heard what A coach does you heard what A player does but you really dont know each other because you havent been through experiences together so youre trying to get a feel for what works or what doesnt work and really you know youre using your contacts people you know an AAU High School is this kid a good fit for us because like you said a lot of times youre going in blinding you dont really know is this kid going to work out in our program exactly and some people some coaches arent really what the players thought in some place its not really what the coach factor in things like nil and and how much guys are going to play and promise us a playing time things like that as Miller is blocked from behind good defense by the Terriers Music Saint Francis is really playing well even if theyre behind theyre still not forcing bad shots frisbee with his first threepoint attempt of the season long run after omir in traffic hell rise and draw the foul on Grisby a good foul by Grisby would have been an easy layup and just watching him is hes a young man that plays with angles he really doesnt play Above the Rim but he uses his body real well he uses upper body strap to finish real well around the rim and thats going to be extremely important what a story on mirror is he hails from Nicaragua we were told that he is the first ever scholarship basketball athlete from the country of Nicaragua and Central America and his coach Jim larenega said he came to a camp in the United States with the intent of going pro and playing in Mexico hes out of Camp here in Miami and the Miami prep head coach said whos that guy who is that she goes up talks to him he ends up at Arkansas State he wins freshman of the year he wins player of the year the next year he goes into the portal now hes here at Miami putting up big numbers and theyre very happy to have him yeah and I tell you what youre going to get a lot of people retreating that area of the world a lot more with his ability to play as well as he does such a global game as Miami forces another turnover running in transition ball knocked away and stolen back by Saint Francis Miami is not handled their transition to smooth as they normally do good extra pass for a Wilcox three halfway down rebounded by Miller Music Wong thought about the step back three heres omir transfer from Arkansas State now one three from the corner OMeara pushed him yeah and its going to be the second foul on OMeara learns very quickly that hes a really good officials in the ACC and those slide little pushes hes not going to be able to get away with the numbers he put up last year at Arkansas State as he checks out our game 18 and 12 hes the nations active leader in rebounding average 12 rebounds a game for his career he was also the defensive player of the year with 57 blocks he shot 63 percent from the field and he really hasnt dropped off too much here hes shooting 62 percent in a games uniform and I think the one thing you can notice long is really trying to set him up um theyre really trying to do a good job of getting him the ball initiating through him another turnover good steal by Miller keep in mind Nigel pack whos Miamis leading scorer tonights been mostly out of the game recently because of two fouls as one will go back to the line this is going to be a really good back point I think for Miami and probably maybe the strength of their team with pack Joseph and Wong weve seen some amazing fans across the ACC now we need your help this winter ACC Network wants to experience each sport from your perspective so snap a pic take a video attacking tag it with the hashtag all the devotion and post it to your social just might see it on acc Network Music so Miamis steadily pulling away trailed 92 in this game early Wong is up to Five Points fourth year Junior from Piscataway New Jersey preseason First Team all ACC and third Team all League each of the last two years Music Applause Howell South 3 is good DeAndre Howell South a mustneeded shot for the Terriers Music they see Saint Francis now coming with some pressure but Joseph does a really good job of handling the ball and getting Miami into his offense nice post speed and another foul will send AJ Casey to the line this young man they really have high hopes for us Casey comes out of Whitney Young High School a great high school out of Chicago I had about three players myself that came out of that High School very very well coached very disciplined legendary program in the windy city also the alma mater of former First Lady Michelle Obama and of note for people around here former 1991 NFL number one draft pick Russell Maryland who played at the U a defensive lineman also a Whitney Young grad Casey himself a fourstar top 60 type recruit made one out of two and it will go over to Saint Francis Music but even when you play at a high level high school like that what is that adjustment like for freshmen coming into the college game well the biggest adjustment is that everybody ran everything for you in high school and theyre not running everything for you in college owl South double clutched bailed out as the ball goes out of bounds and so theres a real need to learn to play with four of the guys that are just as talented as you and sharing the basketball and having the same common interests and goals and not getting frustrated when youre not having a great night Music six on the shot clock inside for Gris B turns and shoots good effort there on the rebound by the Terriers but it comes away to Miami who can hold for one and they will with 20 seconds left and Jim larenega will call a timeout there use it or lose it time out well step aside for a 30 second timeout final 20 coming up from South Florida Music head coach Jim larenega and the Miami Hurricanes with a 12point lead with 20 seconds left to go in the first half Miami looking to improve the 51 on this young season they head to Central Florida UCF on Sunday well play them at five oclock on ESPNU we mentioned that Big 10 ACC challenge against Rutgers next Wednesday back here also on the U H pack has come back in the game for this final shot pack had 12 points early but had to step out with two fouls this is an offensive possession Saint Francis kind of gone Zone trying to take away from what maybe what coach Laredo has grown up looking back and try to pop some shots along and that will be the end of the first half All Things Considered could have been worse for Saint Francis they came out and played well early uh I think tank France had a really good half Miami got going defensively 3826 to score at the half halftime show was one and they feel like beyond that its wide open in that league so Saint Francis whos never been to the big dance feels like theyve got a chance especially after last years Champion Bryant left the league for the America East so come March that NEC tournament is going to be a barn burner and well in the schedule that theyre playing right now will really prepare them for that Music Harris lost the ball another turnover three on two for the canes behind the back is so clever for his side being able to get the ball high on the glass above the shot blockers Music so immediately a turnover leads to a run out for Miami kind of how the first half ended Wilcox hit a three early has been quiet since on the shot clock Clark down the lane strong take to the rim came up short and gets three band a Grisby who lays it back up and in Grisby has played well hes got six points yeah great initial stop by Miami and closing down the lane they have to do a better job on the offensive glass Nigel pack will run the point hes got 14 points to lead the way for all scorers youll shoot a quick three and the rebound to the Terriers Applause St Francis really trying to space before theyre trying to use their ball screens to be able to attack the basket Music speed away tough pass ahead and out of bounds to Saint Francis as a whole beer he showed some of that athleticism I talked about earlier goodness could have gotten ugly there with the premium seats there but he just did kind of a standing broad jump there Wade after by both guys great vertical six seven two fifty coming downhill to the cheer team Music good agility there by the Arkansas state transfer the reigning Sunbelt player of the year its first season with the hurricanes Miami is really tightening up their defense theyre making theyre contesting every pass right now crispy Music long has been quiet only five points for Isaiah Wong Fade Away jumper tough shot and out of bounds to Saint Francis but I tell you what theyll theyll let long do that every time hes really good scoring in the lane elevating in the lane shooting over defenses hes really good at that Music Keynes led by 12 at the half maintaining a doubleditcher cushion here Saint Francis looking to make a push Music down the lane laying it up and in athletically boy Clark omearas got to come over and challenge that a little bit more he cant give up a layup like that he either have to take the charge and make the shot live Applause Music rolling to the rim fumbled the pass nice feed to Miller who lays it in you know one of the things I look at early in the season to see how teams share the basketball this Miami team really likes each other they share the basketball I watch them in the huddles they always picking each other up theyve got really good chemistry and thats where coaches use a lot Music Josiah Harris throws it out of bounds you know with so much talk about uh Nils and transfers and what type of chemistry teams would have in the locker room this Jim land egg has done a really good job with this Miami team almost a highlight sequence there for Miami but it will send the Keynes to the line there you see good pass right there our mayor does a good job of following again he does a really good job of using his logic his upper body especially to create space so that he can finish it around the rim so mayor to be a good freethrow shooter you can tell hes the kind of player thats going to get to the line six or eight times a game well hes going to get fouled a lot I mean hes so strong and he really does a good job of using angles to be able to score at The Rim five points for omir 71 from the line coming into the game extends into a 14point lead which matches Miamis biggest of the game and another steal cat quick by omir three on one pumpkin Applause its really a selfish Pat had the ball he could have possibly shot it but he got it off the popular so he could wind up finishing at The Rim nine points now for wogga Poplar Music Wilcox quick three rebounded by pack the biggest lead of the game for the Hurricanes Poplar two on one alley they need a timeout Saint Francis needs a timeout by having out running pushing the ball they they you see popular right there going up to him here great finish Paynes are in the house last year this Miami program surprised everyone they were picked wealth in the ACC preseason poll ended up winning 26 games going all the way to the elite eight where they lost to the eventual Titleist Kansas this year they picked fourth fourth out of 15 they got a couple of first place votes how do you handle those different types of expectations going into the season well I think a lot of it has to do with your guard play and I think long is a veteran guard I think he steady this group down very impressed with pack I think the way hes limited into this team and the leadership of Jen larnega will send us to another quick timeout just under 16 minutes to go look at the ESPN app weve got 7n4 Wake Forest taking on seven and four Duke in a Tobacco Road Series goes back almost 100 years thats a 3 30 Eastern then at 80 Stern seven and four Pitt taking on Miami looking to get bull eligible its gonna up and down season for the Keynes and head coach Mario Crystal Balls first season here at the U and theyre trying to finish strong and qualify for a bowl with the win over pit ACC Network this weekend St Francis gone into a Zone just to try to give Miami a different look offensive rebound but the putback would not go it stays with Miami this is an interesting lineup Miami has because theyre gone with now the three guards that they have with Joseph pack and Wong this is Jordan Miller tough shot he lost it on the way up he still scores six points thats why hes so versatile for Miami he does so many things now hes playing the four position for him comes off 18 points against Maryland in their last game no fear at the rim for Clark met by omir and stays with Saint Francis Miller in his second year at Miami after three years at George Mason over 1300 career points for the fifth year senior Music Josiah Harris who we spotlighted in the open has been very quiet for Saint Francis dangerous pass quick hands Wilcox in amongst the Trees Too Strong rebounded by Miller Kanes on the Run Nigel pack into the corner for a three for one and Wilcox the board Music and end action here Down the Lane Howell South reverse layup couldnt go omir the board Music Applause Music Miami likes to play at turnover heading the other way for a layup Larry Marino St Francis now is trying to pick up the pace a little bit they went with the Zone earlier now theyre going with four Court man theyre trying to throw a lot of different things at Miami just to try to keep them off balance a little bit Music Applause Music playing high off the window and in 16 the pack is very clever hes got a lot of moves around the back he knows how to use his body hes a very good offensive player came in averaging ten and a half hes not a real big guy just six feet tall yes Miami deep now theyve really stepped it up the second half oh mirror Coast to Coast I was about to say everybody on this Miami team can handle the basketball so they dont turn it over very often because theyre all really good ball handlers Music you mentioned how in Miami is a little bit smallish height wise and in the ACC theyre going to certainly face bigger interior players than theyre seeing here tonight how do you compensate for that well I I think you have to compensate with it with your skill set with your defensive pressure keeping people they cant give up layups like that I mean you gotta extend people and constantly pressure on the basketball and its going to be a challenge I mean it was a challenge last year coach laronega figured it out hes gonna have to figure it out this year how to compensate for it because theyre even smaller than they were last year omir good passing leads to a Jordan Miller three Wilcox the rebound turns it over again Music Wong step back three he got it the thing about long is I really believe any time he sets his mind to scoring hes almost impossible to stop but hes so unselfish and tries to get other people involved that scoring becomes a second thought to him instead of a primary thought hes got eight points as Wilcox buries the three at the other end hes also got eight points would you like to see him be a little more assertive trying to score earlier in the game not necessarily because I think hes a smart enough player that he recognizes the situation I think hes trying to get everybody involved hes trying to get Passion by the mirror involved so I dont blame him for that turned away by the rim quick three at the other end its halfway down rebounded by pack long pass ahead sloppy flag sloppy play as Saint Francis comes away with it Wilcox another three its good tedric Wilcox with 11 Music coach Leon neighbor wants him to slow it down now go back to running what we run back well hear about that tomorrow film session make the layups on Miller free throw line jumper is good Applause thats the one thing about it is I mean hes been around he doesnt get overly excited and hes always in control of his ball Club Music this is Wilcox whos caught fire with a couple threes in a row tetrick Wilcox draws the foul and hell go back to the line sends us to a timeout Miami by 19 his uniform continues to climb up the schools alltime scoring chart now just four points away from passing one of your former players James Jones if he had had a better Coach youd had more points James did an outstanding job he started came in as a five wound up playing the three had a great career in the NBA yeah I dont know who that young fella is but uh I had a lot more hair then uh but James did a just outstanding job hes the general manager president of the Phoenix Suns hes the type of young man that made everybody around him better and thats what made him such a great exec in the NBA but he was a really big time scorer at six nine coach Perry Clark had a nice run here at Miami from 2000 to 2004 mentioned that you had a season where you guys won 24 games finished the season in the top 20 went to the NCAA tournament to see where this Pro you were actually here when this building opened uh you were the head coach then about 20 years ago but how far has this program come to be going to the Sweet 16 in the elite eight uh I tell you what uh coach clarinet has done a tremendous job uh hes given us some stability and which is needed and has allowed this program to really grow this building is a beautiful building it was when it was built and they have made it electric with their players and the way that they played and they moved to the ACC shortly after theyve competed against the best teams in the ACC year in year out the Dukes the Carolinas had a lot of success against those teams they they really did and I remember the game we played against Connecticut when they were really good and they were celebrating the football team winning the ball game and Jim Calhoun scored the ceremony went a little too long and he was just gonna walk out in the middle of it and Jims a tough guy but I said Jim thats the Miami football team out there you might want to rethink it and he decided to wait for the ceremony to begin but uh a lot of really good moments and uh this program has really done a great job in the ACC Saturday at 2 30 Eastern the ACC tunnel crew will get you ready for another afternoon of college football at 6 30 youll get a complete wrapup of those games and theyll get you set for the prime time matchup between Pitt and the Miami Hurricanes on acc Network at eight after the game full post game show to wrap up tonight right here on acc Network and the ESPN app omir misses two from the line quick three its good have a game Tetra Wilcox 15 points he is really shooting the ball well but theyre shooting the ball a little quick than what they look a lot quicker than what they did earlier coach laronega is not pleased 30 second timeout for Miami Music green games recently over the past few years and one of his former players and coaches Michael Huger is the head coach at Bowling Green played for larenega at Bowling Green as pack shoots along three out of the timeout and its rebounded by Saint Francis he really Marvels at how coach laronega even though he is 73 years old is still so successful because he can relate to this younger generation well Jim has a calmness to him and he really has always liked people and he has always tried to bring the best out of young people so it just kind of fits Saint Francis going to work on the glass it stays no it goes over to the canes well coach Leone is not happy right now with their defensive effort theyre really theyre getting beat on the glass and right now their attitude is weve got this game under control and we kind of got it in cruise and he understands that they cant do the things they need to do in the future if they have that kind of attitude so hes trying to get them going again its a 40minute game I mean it may be a 15 point lead is not a 31minute game as the turnaround jumpers Way Off the Mark rebounded by Casey and hes fouled thats a great effort by Casey thats what they need him to do you have to have guys on your team that can produce points for you and you dont have to run everything for them because you cant run everything for everybody so some people have to be able to get it off the glass theyve got to be able to get it off of double teams theyve got to be able to get it out of transition but theyve got to manufacture points for you without you having to call their number or run a special play for them Casey to the line South for Miami but thats just mental concentration thats thats the thing thats bothering coach right now is the things that mentally you can stay focused with and do were not doing and so thats what hes going to be hard on them about how hard is that I mean youre youre running the break youre throwing alley oops youre dunking it youre up 20 plus how do you keep the kids attention I mean naturally theyre going all the games over theres only 10 minutes left thats why coaches get paid that kind of money because theyre supposed to still do that but you have to I mean its its its about process not always results absolutely its a tough jumper is good the trade quarto bomb first time weve called his name out today his dad Fred is actually the director of basketball operations at Kansas and he and Coach biker were on the staff at St Johns before coach brica took over at Saint Francis its long three for Nigel path he when the ACC are going to learn theyre going to have to guard that young man because he really is a really good threepoint shooter Music it has a lot of rain shes got 19 points down the lane blocked long rebound Wilcox he issued from the logo why not tetrick Wilcox has 18 points I am very impressed with the Saint Francis team uh they have not backed up theyve changed their defenses now trying to take some things away from Miami but theyve been really aggressive on the glass and they stayed competitive Wilcox came into the game two out of nine from Beyond The Arc hes five for nine tonight as the three is no good Wong the rebound long to the rim lays it up in hand thats what Mom does so well he attacks the basket in that young man thats what I talked about earlier he can turn it on in a minute I mean he really can go get a basket whenever he wants to Music season high for Wilcox was 10 coming in hes got 18 tonight hes a transfer from division two Dominican College where he scored 29 once shot is partially blocked here come the Kings pack steps back didnt want to shoot the three passes it off to Joseph long rebound save back in to Moreno all the way to the rim lays it up no good end end action packed the other way sneaking out Peck will lay it up and in Applause Music again though Miami cannot be pleased with the defense but its Way Saint Francis getting to the rim they just missed some easy shots there you cant let them get to the rim that easy and uncontested six and a half to go in this one Miami up by 18 there are different ways to make a name for yourself instead for Saint Francis senior Larry Moreno its doing trick shots he has over 133 000 followers on Instagram which is about 133 000 more than coach and I have combined but you see some of his shots here he goes by white cheese hes got some merchandise deals hes got some nil deals thats some good stuff right there light cheese Larry Moreno making a name for himself on Instagram what a time to be alive Im telling you Applause different ways hey hes making a living for himself while hes still in college and we appreciate that hes got eight points on the court here tonight none of them have been of the trick shot variety as Clark down the lane he draws the foul see what you have to cut off that drive neither the guard up top this Garden um the defensive player up top has to come in the lane and help and protect or the center coming over and stopping the penetration guys are getting Saint Francis is getting to the rim and theyre getting clean looks at The Rim theyve missed a few but theyre getting clean looks at the rim and once they get in the ACC youre going to have bigger better players being able to do that so you know when when Miami played Maryland one of the things that coach Leonard was talking about how physical building was and how dominant they were on the inside one out of two for Clark its certainly the physicality and the athleticism that youre going to see from nacc opponent is different than what youre going to see from A team out of the Northeast conference zone defense here for Saint Francis to carved out beautifully by omear who finishes thats thats what this Miami team I think theyre very skilled players and I think they share the basketball very well and again theyre going with a three guard look this might be their most efficient offensive lineup will Cox with the heat check came up short tough bounce pass in transition Falls loose on the floor and its picked up by Josiah Harris Music good ball movement here by Saint Francis leads to an open three its good nice looking offense there quarter bomb the three patience now Miami just needs to have a little patience and run some good offense theyll wind up with a good look Music pack probing the defense Fade Away jumper is good season High 23 for Nigel pack they used that dribble hand off a lot to allow guards to be able to get into the lane and create they also run that dribble handoff and then have a big man come up into the ball screen Music three from the corner for quarter Bond oh mirror vacuums up the rebound omiras ninth Board of the game at the other end omear 10th Board of the game will double the place of his career Music Applause Music out of bounds to Miami now 15 and 10 for omir omir does a really good job of running the floor and he gets really good position and hes able to use angles to finish and offensively hes so unselfish I mean when he gets the ball hes looking to make the next pass Music Music long tough shot hell go to the line final media timeout Miami up by 20 the ESPN app on Tobacco Road at seven and four Wake Forest taking on seven and four Duke thats at 3 30 Eastern then at 80 Stern Series dates back to 1950 74 Pittsburgh theyve won three in a row they take on Miami looking to get bull eligible mccains and the Panthers eight oclock start natural Pax head the big night its the most points any hurricane has scored All Season 23 hes really played extremely well and again I think this is a time when this hurricane team is starting to come together they came off a great tournament run and now coming right back home playing Thanksgiving students on here all their friends have kind of gone home I think theyve kind of slept walk some of the game but for the most part theyve been involved and been very enthusiastic and very efficient in what they theyre trying to do definitely brought a lot of defensive energy after a slow start Robert Lee and Perry Clark with you from the watsco center in Coral Gables Miami three and a half minutes away from its fifth victory of the season Wilcox had it stolen away Wong running the other way Wong had it knocked away back to Saint Francis Music certainly not the crispest performance by Miami or Saint Francis for that matter but thats to be expected this early in the season you know but I think both of these two teams will benefit from this game because I think that Miami has been efficient when theyve needed to be efficient and they picked it up when they needed to pick it up I think for Saint Francis I think they have hung tough theyve executed theyve played hard and I think their benefit out of this game they definitely have things to build on them and theyre taking on a team with athleticism like theyre not going to see in the Northeast conference and theyve recorded themselves relatively well youre looking at it you say its a 22 point lead but theyve been competitive throughout just a lot of turnovers have led to a lot of runouts and easy baskets desperation shot at the buzzer shot clock violation that dunk on the last possession for Miami was from favor Ira his first two of the game Music but Ive been really impressed with Miamis defense when they really had to lock in and theyve done a really good job with that and they when they needed to clean up their rebounding they cleaned up their rebounding but I think from a standpoint of being able to execute offensively their skill set offensively I think theyre very talented I mean will improve to five and one heading into a matchup at UCF on Sunday at five thats going to be a heck of a ball game the other one last year uh Johnny Dawkins has that team playing very well turnover Music and itll stay with Saint Francis Applause Harlan Beverly who just checked into the game for Miami who turned it over as both teams getting some of their reserves some playing time donello yelvanovic a freshman from Milwaukee checks in for Miami hell replace Nigel pack well get a nice hand as he checks out Applause you know when you bring New Gods in especially new guys that are scoring you know getting them integrated and getting the chemistry is really not the easiest thing coach larenegger has done a really good job with that tonight Zion Bethea its almost his point total with a field goal this is Christian Watson a freshman from Maryland athletic taken a score Music hes a big time athlete push the ball on the floor real well very skilled Music King Francis will fall to two and three they play at South Florida on Friday especially going to stay in town here overnight and then bust up to South Florida and Tampa tomorrow morning before playing on Friday in the afternoon and then flying back to New York City on Friday night you know but St Francis stayed within the things that they do well they havent made a lot of special adjustments for Miami they they just missed some easy shots but they really played well Watson Thea clears the glass in the final minute and a timeout I think theyre just yeah to get everybody in the game Music so no actual huddling just a chance for Saint Francis to get Michael perrotta into the game his dad Tom actually an assistant at Hofstra and a former head coach at Canisius also Matthew Gonzalez into the game a sophomore from Brooklyn Music Miami has a tough stretch coming up they have Rutgers then theyve got to go to Louisville to open the ACC season and those games are going to be very difficult Music attacked the basket Music Murray at the line the teams only true freshman hes from Baltimore averaging about a point of game this season Applause what Saint Francis of Brooklyn beat Miami here nine years ago they will not tonight win the second out of three games in this series Ira the rebound well you see iron hes a freshman from Nigeria with a 73 wingspan and I believe it he covers half the quote when he extends his arms he really does and hes really explosive uh Washington to shoot around hes got good hands too oh Watson wanted to just hammer it he was foul that was a great drive right there see him finish at The Rim but see how high he was above the rail I mean that explosiveness coaches talked about bringing some of these guys along and Music Watson a true freshman from Lanham Maryland playing in his third game of the season that DC area has been awful good to Jim marinega and so its a lot of talent there former head coach of George Mason where he took him to the final four its a lot of relationships in that area for sure final 22nd Music Music second portal bomb into the corner for a three thats blocked hit the side of the backboard final four seconds here one second left that basket counts significant to some 25 Point Victory on the dunk at the buzzer Music a great team win by the Hurricanes they got the defense up when they wanted to offensively they really did a good job executing sharing the basketball uh thats really a good team wins Music 8156 the final Miami improves the 51 Saint Francis Falls to two and three were going to take a 90second timeout we plan on being joined by Nigel pack when we return Music
