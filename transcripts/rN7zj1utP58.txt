tonight of NC Central also in his 15th season with the Eagles Lamar Simpson Joe Lindsay Bart Lennox are officials tonight and off we go from jpj NC Central with the first possession in the black Virginia defends in the white talk with talking with Tony Benny talked about all the different sets that North Carolina Central will run thatll be a challenge for the Wahoos Kobe harway takes the first three and misses and a rebound for Isaac mcney starting line for the Cavaliers ree be been number one in the ACC and assists with six per game Andrew roie comes off his best two scoring nights as a Applause Cavalier beakman the senior from Milwaukee so important to this Cavaliers team he elevates for a tray and the weak side rebound for Perry Smith Jr starting five for the Eagles tonight Terrence Crawford the walkon makes his first first career start some injuries for the Eagles to deal with PoBoy King is the top score at 15 1 half per game yeah three starters missing and the sixth man missing well talk about that as the game goes on Cavaliers three on two in transition McNeely is open and that is a mistake for the Eagles started right where he left off with 22 a career high against Syracuse McNeely is still feeling it have a stoppage here as the officials work on the clock there is lvll moton was a player at NC Central third all time in Eagles history with over 1700 points took over the program back in 2009 first two years 500 or below but in 10 out of the last 12 years winning seasons Mac yeah and several Conference titles multiple regular season titles uh he really has got this program back to back to its Glory Days said hes really excited about the challenge of playing Virginia started the season on the road in Allen Fieldhouse against then number one Kansas three is short for Josh Smith and pakman controls for the Applause Caps mcney a lot of space buries it just cant lose him thatll drive coach M crazy on this other end you know there they are playing without their point guard without their best rebounder and without their best threepoint shooter they finally break the ice here Josh Smith with the two NC Central Trails by four so Mac youve been in these situations many times before right where you have key players out of the lineup if youre NC Central what do you do to combat some of those injuries youre facing well coach moton is looking for who else can step up maybe some of these guys havent had necessarily a chance but now they theyve got their opportunity on a very very big stage oh Isaac mcney another splash down and he is three for three not too big a stage for Isaac mcneel he said he knew coming into this season hed have to take more shots and hes finding the right ones Harry Smith Jr on the two nice little ball screen and roll right Music Applause there all right Mac news flash 11 in white at the top of your screen dont leave him open yeah get that Terrence Crawford what what a what a job for a wall coin lets lets guard the second best shooter in America Isaac McNeely Music Applause 444 he may not be second anymore after fourth straight uh who else we going to show here I think its Isaac mcney responsible for all the Cavaliers points and that Rim is as big as an ocean right now Cavaliers by eight over the Eagles this holiday will be magical this will be a Bs head holiday where every detail is exceptional with quality and craftsmanship worthy of the Bs head name and a slow roasted sweet slice uncured ham crafted for carving brings everyone together with experiences worth sharing and moments worth savoring welcome to the magic of a Bor head holiday Bor head compromise elsewhere cant sleep just a lot on my mind I cant sleep either it only gets tougher with age mom what well knowing Progressive can protect your home model in business should help you relax good cuz I could use a good nights sleep me too you know how early a chimy sweep gets up every day wait is this all a dream why would Jamie be in my dream I am Americas biggest spokesperson debatable I said biggest well hes got you there Bean lays it in in transition and Virginia all of the sudden is up 10 hey the first person not named Isaac mcney to score tonight for the Applause Cavaliers what a start for the POA West Virginia native the ex POA dots one of the top nicknames in American High School no doubt about that we may talk about nicknames a little later or actually real names that sound like nicknames the guy defending the ball right now PoBoy King Andrew roie the former Tommy of St Thomas on a kick out McNeely from the corner the moans and the groans of the jpj faithful and on the other end the slam Kean Porter in the game for NC Central thats one of the ways when youre struggling offensively to to get going get something in transition where you got the numbers in the nice finish about porter porter started the first five games this season then jadarius Harris became a starter if youre just joining us no Harris no Fred Cleveland no Manny euna board tonight for NC Central three of their Applause starters Eagles trying to work their way back into the game maybe a good way to do that get ahead of this UVA defense keyan Porter ahead of the pack will Ur for his teammates oh and how about this back cut here yeah out of the timeout you think Tony Bennett has something up his sleeve but but isnt that smart coaching right you saw your guy hit four threes you know NC Central is going to guard the perimeter and now you go inside with that guy 100 thats why I got hung that National Championship banner and a bunch of Applause others shot clock down to five here for the Eagles Josh Smith on a pass down low and sticking in the light down low it is Perry Smith yeah that the help got there just a little bit late just missed that pass gave up the easy basket nice execution by The Eagles when youve watched the Eagles offense throughout the season what do you see theyre aggressive they really attack they really attack on both ends and thats kind of their identity play really hard and be aggressive on both ends we spoke with Coach Moten before the game and he said you know some of the pillars of our program throughout the year were really gritty may not have the talent that other guys have but we play really hard and hes trying to Institute that with this really fresh roster that he has this season yeah and there there was that aggression I showed you off the that we talked about penetration the help has to come bounce inside for the easy bad and not much comes easy against this Virginia Defense heres the penetration see the help up the lane and then Harry Smith with another easy basket SM Smith with six early points here the really good offensive rebounder has been the Sixth Man of course pressed into duty here tonight the Vermont transfer had a career high 17 points all in the second half in NC Centrals last game against USC Upstate that was a threepoint loss back on Saturday yeah thats where they started losing some of their players to injury and uh and Smith took advantage of that in a really good half and in a close loss to USC Upstate and a lane violation and one more free throw for Andrew roie those are the mistakes you cant make on the road against this Cavaliers team yeah the margin for err is very small and control the things you can control oh for three counts is 0 for two some changes here for the Cavaliers nice hand for Elijah gertrud who wears number 12 in white The Freshman who was planning on red shirting this season but with the injury to Dante Harris in practice last week sprained his right ankle they have burned the red shirt for gerud and really is an athletic player for this Cavaliers team yeah he he got loose for a couple baskets against Syracuse thatll be on the highlight tape at the end of this season finished with six against the orange Blake Buchanan also in Leon Bond as well we saw Bond have a huge game against North Carolina t last time you an hour here how about the athleticism from gerud right on Q he gets from one end to the other in a hurry lot of raw tools that coach Bennett loves Smith too short mcney gobbles it up Isaac mcney with 14 points two rebounds hes played seven minutes Ro sprints on the kick gertrud from the perimeter this time offensive rebound for Buchanan McNeely from way downtown his feet were on the saber against Syracuse on one of his threes on Saturday he was hitting them from bodos Bagels good local reference and good bagels oh yeah Timmy adad is in the game for NC Central heres a big SWAT inside shot clock down to three and the Miss from King yanon cleans it up coach Ben getting to look at a lot of different combinations here early in this Music Applause one Bond on the iso Zips a bounce pass to mcney BU cannon on the pump shot clock melts down to six roie no hesitation why not you see a conundrum there hes such a good threepoint shooter but hes like three for eight from the free throw line on the year he too close in there yeah more comfortable on the outside 5 threes already for the Cavaliers mcney whos been much better defensively as well this season moving his feet very well according to coach Bennett another late shot box situation for the Eagles and they can it here with Josh Smith its really night its a score at Independence Community College in Kansas so the two Smiths have combined for 11 of the 13 for the Music Eagles NC Central shows some manto man some Zone 23 131 32 coach Bennett prepared for everything tonight Bond muscles his way in and rattles it down an interesting guy got some real bounce to him can post up got nice midre range hes very active I swear he plays bigger than Hes listed yeah 65 its crazy aggressive hedge on the ball screen a turnover gertude up and Applause down Ryan dun Have Some Cuts in the second half and we know how good they are yeah and then a couple of games later against Georgia on the road in Athens NC Central was tied at 32 in the second half Georgia used a 132 run took control of the game but theyve been competitive and heck they were competitive last year at John Paul Jones Arena to begin the season so level moton 15th year as the head coach he knows what hes doing on that sideline yeah yeah very well respected nationally and uh hes hes had a lot of opportunities to leave but uh but he loves the culture at North Carolina Central poetry in Moten his nickname from his playing days with NC Central in the 90s all right Mac Eagles trailing by a dozen here they havent fallen behind by 20 or 25 early here what could they do to keep improving as this first half continues well theyre executing against one of the best defenses in America this this is better than anything they can ever do in practice and and this will give them confidence if they can have some success here in Charlottesville Applause tonight you know Tony Bennett the head coach for UVA he spoke about this following the game against Syracuse and playing some really talented athletic guards like JJ Starling and Judah men they really packed that paint in and forced Syracuse to take the outside shot they didnt make it if a team is packing the paint as aggressively as UVA does like like what do you do well you you youve got to move the basketball then youve got to move people Bond on the fade thats kind of what he did last time we saw him he he could post up make a move be aggressive to the rim or that nice little touch from the 10ft mark the careerhigh 16 points against NC and back on November 14th 8 of 10 from the floor anadir with the Miss Virginia with numbers peakman swerves and scores hes never out of control you he really was the difference in the in the Syracuse game and MC had 22 points but but beatman made the offense go he so seasoned fourth year as a cavaliere hes gone from role player to the extreme Limelight so good on both ends of the floor and doesnt have to score a point to be good offensively hes got four points right now two of three from the floor hes efficient never feels like hes trying to do too much bond from the elbow Cashes in thats what we were talking about the midrange its kind of old school I like old school you do like anything old six points now for Bon hes perfect from the Applause Music Applause field guy fought looy is in the game number one in black sophomore from upper Maro Maryland single digits on the shot clock and its swed away Leon bond with the rejection three on three we go the other way beakman to gertude line it up and misses off to the right rebound for Perry Smith its a great time to shoot the three though in transition the defense flattens out and all of a sudden youve got a wide open threepoint shot at the Music arc the Cavaliers were four of four to St with Isaac mcney down to 5 for 11 I think coach Bennett would still take that margin percentage got to get the ball side to side and you said ball movement is key against this defense for UVA you leave it on one side youll never get in there nearly with the English it was Josh Smith who couldnt get it off the Music window beakman showcasing the handles tane Murray is in the game ton white the Junior from Auckland New Music Zealand yanan who started a couple of games this season fumbles it and forfeits possession NC Central in transition but a turnover font lys pass is too low we talked about Leon Bond on the other end had 16 and against North Carolina ENT he can also play a little bit on the defensive end watch this not your older brothers Cavaliers a lot of fresher faces getting the job done for the who this season yeah and and we talked about this the last time we were here the continuity that is the Virginia program but with only three returning guys that that played a lot they were going to depend on the youth and fortunately they are contributing in a big way you know you go back to the Syracuse game on Saturday UVA won by over 20 points out of the 200 available minutes in that game 129 of them were played by either first year or seconde players so it just shows you the trust that coach Bennett has in these young guys yeah we talk about that with him in in the in the uh pregame meeting where he you know he is developing that trust in what he can count on them to do night in and Night Out ohboy King the top scorer on the team back in the game misses off the back rim and the rebound for Ryan Dunn it was nice execution to get the little floater in the lane couldnt knock it down but that was what coach moton is looking for from an execution standpoint Virginia with 11 assists on the 13 field goals theyve made could this be another dime no offensive rebound and a foul good AC ity underneath from Applause Dunn he inevitably makes four or five plays in a game where you just go Music wow and this is one hes wrestling but he elevates above everybody else to come down with the ball I love that hes listed as a guard too that always makes me smile yeah that sounds like part of the recruiting process right there you can dribble the ball were going to name you a guard grov sets the screen beakman and the rebound for PoBoy King still scoreless tonight Virginia has paid a lot of attention to pooy and its not beakman defending him right now its roie yeah its been roie a Music lot the Hedge works again for the Cavs disruption and a steal mcne dishes ahead done on a Applause trampoline did I mention he does something four or five times a game thats two yeah I may have underestimated you may see 10 or 11 of those types of plays tonight Cavaliers by 20 and some of the things he does you know doesnt necessarily show up on the highlight film he can really guard the basketball he can stay between his stay in the basket bman again with another steal Neely with the heads up the Finish yeah he finished that dunk like you finish a broadcast spectacular youre so kind whatever you ate for breakfast this morning keep eating that right tomorrow its a double header for mens college hoops on acc Network first its Ruckers taking on Wake Forest in North Carolina at 6 Eastern and South Carolina faces number 24 Clemson to wrap up the night PJ Hall the ACC player of the week Clemson 70 18th in the net right now number one of any ACC team yeah Clemson and Virginia are the top two in the net in the ACC I dont know if anybody had that on their bingo card preseason uh no not on mine big lineup out there for Tony Bennett right now got Jordan Miner in the game 22 in white the marac transfer and Groves and done heres a steel PoBoy King your Applause Music majesty thatll get him going Ro at 66 playing the point St Thomas Music Applause transfer coach m talked about playing point guard by committee and were seeing it live here tonight and with no Dante Harris on the back cut done lays it in beautiful pass by grov you know sometimes you dont need a point guard right when you have bigs that can pass the ball like that the a point Center little Princeton like action right there give the assist to Groves firste Cavalier moving over from Oklahoma prior to that Eastern Applause Music Washington Josh Smith freelancing Too Short good defense McNeely bodies Music Applause up hboy King is the top scorer for NC Central at 15 a half per game game had yet to score before this Music Jam everybody else so uh I think theyre certainly trending in the right way ranked for the first time in one of the polls and like you mentioned number two in the net in the Applause ACC right now the deao number 26 team of the nation the AP pole shot clock at three Miner on a kick out by has to hoist and Banks it in it is going uvas way tonight the look on his face said it Applause all its like hes disappointed in himself he is disappointed in himself its like a man hey man uh still three points on the board and thats his first three so congrats to him it doesnt always go the way you painted it in your head thats what hes think it seconds trickling down one footer for King no dice Miner cleans it Music up Mur run the point and leading the team in assist with four Dean on the bench right now mcney had a notion Miner squeezes inside cant finish and the rebound for Perry Smith good job by Perry Smith bodying up in there and theyll count the two tell you what the Eagles have run the floor pretty aggressively throughout the night yeah and and that was part of the plan for Coach M theyre theyre always aggressive on the offensive Applause end and there it was he did not call it we confirmed that and look at the face yucky oh oh you cant be unhappy with with that ball going in regardless when Im at the YMCA and I hit that shot Im jumping for joy yeah but youre not very good hes good perfect on the night four for four one for one he should pay us to come he had 16 last time we were here yeah I mean Ill come back regardless but yeah so will I all right so now dun takes it up the court so here you go point guard by committee approach theres Ro out of the G of course gertruds in there and he has some experience more of a combo kind of guy closer to that than anybody else ger tries the triple Applause nylon Shooters keep shooting that looked good going in and that is Elijah gertruds first career three well the trend we said 0612 so hes got hes on his way thats right zero points against AM six against Syracuse offensive foul and gerud gets a round of applause from the Cavaliers Music Applause bench little corner fade screen by McNeely gets Gertrude wide Music open and when they move that line back a lot of folks step out of bounds right there so our officiating crew tonight Lamar Simpson Joe Lindsay and Bart Lennox are reviewing this last play to see if it may have been a flagrant Music foul 4119 our score Virginia leads NC Central the second all time meeting between these two teams heres the play once again PoBoy King on the ball oh right there when he swung his arms up high so for you is that a natural basketball act well it it can be although most folks most folks swing it through at a lower level but taking the ball above the head you always run that risk it did not look intentional to me but it still could be flagrant yeah they may they may get flagrant right there again it doesnt look intentional it looks like a a basketball move but when you make contact above the neck you take that risk so the offensive player is responsible here essentially well well see if the defense is in the cylinder which I dont think he was no he wasnt in the cylinder of protection thats afforded the offensive player so once he steps outside of that thats going to thats probably going to be a flagrant foul well of importance it is the second foul on PoBoy King top scorer for NC Central just two points tonight one of five from the Music floor yeah they have certainly Str Str and this was this was what we expected Joe Lindsay comes over to chat with us so watch the review its a cylinder foul on 12 white hes got his hands on its a cylinder violation Fs not on the black team its on white 12 black on the sideline okay thats exactly what we were talking about the cylinder and one I wasnt paying attention to his body was not in the cylinder but his hands were in the cylinder so the foul is going to be on Gertrude watch him put his see his hands on him his hands on his body so that violated the cylinder that puts the foul on the defense no matter what the offense does can you agree with that there yeah it makes sense now that I I look at his hands his body was not in that cylinder and he didnt get in there that way but his hands were on the body of king oh boy King and so thats important as well like you mentioned King had the two foul now it drops back down to one Harry Smith has been the best player so far tonight for NC Central harway tosses it up and misses Dunn Music Applause collects dun is badgered here by Porter good defense really good defense now the fourth year Junior isan por has been very good Applause he was what he was one that charge from Pine Toops North Carolina about 90 minutes away from Durham started his career at Ratford moved on to Cape Fear Community College in Wilmington his first season with NC Central minute to go here in our opening half Virginia at 63 from the floor 17 of 27 beakman back in bond to Buchanan five on the timer Buchanon misses Bond slaps harroways got it King can get going tried to jump start himself little two for one situation but the differential is just at four here as the Cavaliers slowly bring it across 14 points for mcney leads all Applause Music Applause Music Applause scores pman assesses opts to take the ball screen from Buchanan the Hedge from NC Central fires it to bond off one foot misses two seconds to go in the half at midcourt Smith too Music Applause strong is in for NC Central and we are underway in the second half Isaac mcney LED all scores with 14 in the first 20 Porters done a much better job on mcney at the quick four threes on a fade from twopoint land misses and a rebound from Porter right on schedule Harry Smith was tops for Central with six in the first half this is to the perimeter for herway misses offensive rebound for Josh Smith UVA plus six in the opening half on the glass yeah and thats only the second offensive rebound I know thatll please Tony Bennett that its been that low a number thats the one place that really stood out to him that they needed to improve and the Cavaliers on average minus four in the rebounding margin which so far early in the season is last in the ACC and he admitted to US during our PR pregame conversation our team doesnt have a lot of physicality strength size we have to use our athleticism on the class yeah athleticism and and positioning and thats what theyve done tonight theyve done a nice job of blocking out and battling and winning it with roie gang rebounding you cant out jump him outnumber Music them beakman goes all the way to the basket and easy deuce I just love watching it play the game looks so easy to Music him sometimes its like watching him on ice skates moves so fluidly on the courner hes one of those guys who could be going really fast and not look like hes trying to go fast hes totally under control with that basketball you know Beakmans always been a guy whos been one of the guys heres the rebounding margins for Virginia throughout the season plus six against Syracuse first time but the Cavaliers out rebounded the opponent in the open floor dun attacks the rack and that Rim is experiencing an earthquake steal from beakman assist by beakman dunk by dun probably not the last time well say that this season no I venture to say well use that a whole bunch ohboy King 35 in black only two points in the first Music half down the lane that was a contested jumper sweltering defense from Ro who gets poked in the left eye and the officiating crew stops play yeah Ro has drown that uh that defensive assignment for the most part and has done a really good job against King Music oh yeah everybody going for the basketball isan Porters been really active on both ends of the floor since hes gotten in the game mention from Pine tops North Carolina thats a great name for North Carolina right over in eastern North Carolina over near Rocky M and hes a guy who can really score he had 41 points in a game Community College I know its a different level but just shows you what he can do on the offensive end heres a turnover from the Cavs hboy King and theres McNeely good solid defense three onone beakman to the rim Groves BR hes doing a nice job of running the floor not a typical Center but he fits in well with his skill set graduate student good size at 69 Kings three Miss fire and D Applause Music hustles Elijah gerud set the check in mcney near his own bench rattles it down mcne with five threes be I think beatman has an assist on every basket this half except the one he made kcks his spot so well now he agitates guy font looy at midcourt maximum effort at all times and Centrals effort has been there have not been able to get the ball in the basket on a regular basis and they do here with Smith Smiths been kind of the exception from the very beginning he has finished around the rim in traffic and just a remind everybody NC Central is down three starters tonight Fred Cleveland their top distributor jadarius Harris their top threepoint shooter and their starting center Manny eunor their top rebounder yeah thats tough BR spills off and the rebound for harway you know coming up here to play Virginia in Charlottesville is Tough Enough Duty now you got to come shorthanded almost impossible yet they cons theyve continued to battle Porter airball and Ro loses it but at last touches an eagle Virginia has hit four of its last five shots and the guy whos been the recipient of many great Reese beatman passes now these guys we talked about the athleticism and the need to use it they are getting out and getting those EAS easy basket thatll lead you to 60 field goal shooting which Tony Bennett will take every single night gerud has been fantastic Off the Bench with seven points done a starter perfect from the field with six three of three everybody contributing tonight for UVA see if Blake Buchanan can get going here a little bit I I thought he and minor might have a little more impact on this game in the first half neither one had a lot going on in that first half see if they do here in the second half theyve got a size Advantage down low yanan without a point so far as beakman is fouled Virginia makes just its second trip to the free throw line 0 of two yeah nobody shooting any free throws in this thing very Music much so beakman goes to the line on his career just over 77 and a half from the free throw line Virginia has a team just below 70 thats 12th out of 15 in the ACC Sunday its a womens basketball double header on acc Network first at noon its Florida GF Coast taking on Duke followed by Kentucky versus number8 Team Louisville catch all the action on the ESPN app as well Kiki Jefferson off to a great start in her Louisville career averaging 12 per game transfer from James Applause Madison just about 5 minutes gone by here in the second half uvas lead is up to 32 loose ball picked up and a score for Smith Harry Smith from Augusta Georgia beatman with the ball came in tonight 48 assists and 11 turnovers incredible percentage tonight four more assists no turnovers 12th in the nation an assist turnover ratio coming in Gert oh man that is pretty Applause Tony V said he just solved something in him and he said that athleticism made him think hes going to be a great defender one day fourstar recruit Hudson Catholic Regional High School from Jersey City Hudson Music catley F ly a high arching three loose ball at F Smith hes got magnets on his hands he really has played well hes got half their points Hudson Catholic been some good players in this league from Hudson Catholic remember Micha Corin from North Carolina before your time oh come on my time what are you talking about this youre a part of the country up there yeah Baseline Drive head up presence of mind to know where the defense Music was I know its a small thing hes playing his third game of college and he didnt rush that reverse l i mean all not at all thats what I talked about the presence of mine just to to be calm about it and he he got open by being really explosive with that first step he gets closer to that 12point Benchmark you said hed have tonight didnt have a point his first game six and second simple half yeah it made total sense to me of course oh beakman with the swipe beakman accelerates bolting to the right oh its stamped on the back for the putb is in for B great hustle from Porter though yeah great hustle Porter we talked about how well hes played since since he came in this game and and bond of course running the floor too the red short Music Applause Music freshman quter Zips to the free throw line hacked on the way up and scores through the contact Music K Fear Community College he is going against one of the great Defenders bodies him up a little bit creates some space in Cape Fear down near Wilmington one of 11 newcomers this NC Central team its going to take time for this team to gel theyve survived the early portions of the schedule at 4 and five its not like theyre 2 and seven right now no and they played some good basketball too and theyve had a chance to win a couple more they followed up every loss with a win ah that streak is going to end tonight LEL moton his 15th year as the NC Central head coach has brought this team to four NCA tournaments 2014 17 18 and 19 mcney on the bounce Bond swarm on a triple gertude and a loose ball foul will stay right here and Harry Smith looks at the officiating crew and turns his head and says ah come Music on these guys we mentioned them playing shorthanded but of course these guys are all getting more extended minutes too and coach moton said thats kind of the bright spot of this game and as you noted during our conversation with Coach m NC Central is not in line for an at large selection in the NCA tournament this is about building towards the Mak tournament in March everything is March when youre in a one bid League McNeely on the contested jumper hes really improved proved his handling certainly hes a more confident player hes up to 17 points six away from establishing another new career high at the 22 against Syracuse back on on Music Saturday off the flare screen Rising for the jumper thats short on the rebound and will stay right here off the Miss from Applause Music Applause Smith Porter was lobbying hard making sure that wasnt on Laughter him Andrew roie back in the game taking out Elijah gertrud Music Josh Smith the recipient of the inbound and puts it down thats really nice and again typical of North Carolina Central basketball attacking aggressive here it is little curl and Tay Murray got there a little late he was guarding the ball out of bounds should have stepped Music in and we talk about the experience for NC Central that is gained tonight you could say the same for a guy like Murray theyre both facing similar situations your Virginia with three players who played a year ago Central with four but no starters coming back from North Carina Central crazy returned just 15 of their points from last season Virginia only returned earns 28 of its points but some guys who were with the program a season ago expanding their roles mcney fouled at Mid Court Josh Music Smith you know and its all about these mini games too right we mentioned this earlier in our show start of the Season at number one Kansas NC Central loses 99 to 56 but the eagles only get outscored by two in the second half Im sure coach moton would love to see that same type of effort tonight thats exactly what hes looking for Bond uses the pivot foot on the turn that is an incredibly difficult shot he made it look easy he did and he just explodes up above the defender no matter where the situation is and from 15 ft and in deadly and weve seen him make a three was off the glass he didnt he wasnt happy with it but it still counted well Tony Bennetts going to be more than happy with his effort tonight 13 points six of seven with five rebounds two assists MCN rips the Applause courts Isaac mcney now has 22 points which ties his career high hes six of eight from three he was also six of eight from three against Syracuse backto back Music games one led him to a one and0 record in the league Smith slicing missing bond with the rebound you get the sense that McNeils times running out see if he can get a basket F Canon adjusts and puts it Music Applause down he had some success earlier in the season at the 18point game against Florida at the Spectrum Center in Charlotte and a timeout from NC Central Leon Bond student athlete at this University you got to give these guys a lot of credit for what they do on and off the court yeah exam time can be stressful at uh at the at the at the better academic schools and certainly UVA fits that category next game for the Cavaliers December 16th at home against nor Eastern you can watch that game on acc Network 6 pm 3 nonconference games left before they get into the heat of the ACC play Notre Dame is the next ACC opponent coming up December 30th NC Central trying to build up some steam before this time runs out and nearly a shot clock violation and then the trees show up with fanan and bond yeah a little size Advantage right there with a couple of freshman in there contesting roie to the slipping buenon wow his sixth assist roie with great vision he had three assists against AM four against Syracuse and that was a small window as they say in the NFL yeah finding that tight end over the middle ohboy King dashes misses and it for two to leeve Falls right in his lap hey or you could say he hustled and followed it up its been a rough night for him four points two of 12 now from the floor but sticking with Applause Music it King actually played a ball for Rasheed Wallaces team and Sheed is a good friend of lavel motons and Sheet actually goes to NC Central games roie on a line drive Dart misses dun is called for the Music foul Well normally hboy King puts the ball in the basket with ease and has been difficult tonight Cavaliers by 35 over the Eagles last week wrapped up the inaugural ACC SEC mens basketball challenge we saw a lot of parody in this competition both conferences winning seven but the lower ranked teams getting wins its pretty interesting to investigate yeah I dont know how you can even predict early in the season games like this and that the chaos that ensued in the ACC SEC challenge is evidence of that Virginia beat number 14 Texas AM last Wednesday 59 47 and really enjoyed watching that and looking forward to seeing that competition for years to come so theres Elijah gertrud uh if youve been watching him over the last couple of games he normally wears number 12 but you can see a little bit of a gash on his nose and so there was some blood so he has changed to number 55 does not have a name on the back of his jersey but that is Mr ger the witness protection Applause program well if he starts to go off in this number they have to think about a numeral change little little Zone Action for the first time for North Carolina Central yeah Tony Bennett said they have a lot of different defenses available gerud no space Fades though misses youan in and its slapped out of bounds nice hustle there from Smith yeah Perry Smith has played a really good basketball game theres bond with the defensive play but in the background blocking out they caught a piece of aija gertruds nose and Ethan CBA the athletic trainer the busy man for the Cavs appears to be no worse for the wear see what Im saying yeah Elijah gertrud is now in double figures with 11 five of nine one point away from being on schedule yes 0 612 in his first three games natural progression order a onehander skyed too strong bond with the rebounds por doesnt have a lot statistically to tell you how well he has played here tonight on both ends of the floor Im with you there Jordan Miner is in the game as is Kane Murray Bon peeling missing rebound Josh Smith big lineup for Virginia right now with minor andon on the floor at the same time oh and a late foul is called gertrud in disbelief coach Bennett says he has some work to do on the defensive end but on the offensive end his game appears to be pristine on the step back J by always right Tennessee rainwater Supreme cook and Church Hill bouns what a great list I love Churchill Bounds I know hes down there at fifth but uh but I really like that one the best well there are some incredible stories so

thats wrong thats just wrong somebody needs to fix that and you mentioned it should be part of an nil deal serving on a platter now hes a really good personality great chatting with him this morning an outstanding player although you havent seen it here tonight because of Virginias defense overall NC Central shooting at just 29 from the floor and and even there so we saw that in the first half Bond banks in a three hes unhappy he hits it off the back rim gets the kind roll and hes still unhappy yeah he he wants to play even better and hes playing darn well hes got 14 points and Miner commits the foul here on Music porter porter seven points five rebounds but hes been on the floor more times than anybody tonight hes logged a lot of minutes as well 31 of them this even evening

and uh theyve had a little more success you can and especially here in the second half had a couple nice baskets down low like see him use that size though like that to pass from minor the Finish By Buu Canon freshman from corane Idaho about 35 minutes east of Spokan played on the same aou program as Jake Music Rose ohboy too strong and Murray skies for the board Cur getting some extended minute at the point guard spot that theyll do nothing but help this Virginia basketball team oh thats a tough step back that he puts right through 13 points see why he was a fourstar recruit huh yeah now hes eclipsed 12 points you said hed be on schedule with 12 does that still count or or no yeah were counting it Applause Music Josh Smith surveys Perry Smith sets the Music screen really good job stepping on screen by banon and fought Leroy is fouled gerud yeah he doesnt like it yeah cant bail him out cant even take a chance on bailing him out but on offense watch this little step back create just enough space that shot looks Applause pure back to Defender off really nice play The Freshman went from red shirting to starring in just about two weeks but you can tell uh Tony Bennett doesnt love the foul that he just committed no you cant you cant do that you know you bail him out 710 of a second on the shot clock hes taking a tough shot dont even come close even if you didnt foul him shouldnt be in the vicinity and and this is a 40minute basketball game you go back to Saturday Virginia had a lead of over 30 Syracuse goes on a 10 nothing run closes the Gap to around 20 with just about 4 minutes to go and Tony Bennett was not happy he was pretty much yelling at his bench step up the Applause effort nice bounce Miner cant finish he you dont have Tony Bennetts record by coasting down the stretch of any game a win tonight its 349 for him at UVA F Leroy a shot fake step back three the former Governor of Austin P his first season with NC Music Central Murray Rockets it gerud unloads and the rebound for Kai Dixon in the game for the first time the Junior from Toronto Josh Smith elevates and it falls to Miner again if youre just joining us NC Central out of the Mak pick third in the conference only behind Howard and Nori state but the Eagles are down three starters tonight including their top distributor Fred Cleveland their top threepoint shooter jadarius Harris and Manny eunor their top rebounder Music yanan fouled by Music Dixon Virginia trying to wrap it up here against NC Central yeah that that was an interesting hire Jay bat the new ad there used to work with him at East Carolina University and uh that was a that was a an out of the boox thinking high and uh it looks like its paying some dividends early and of course a great player with great contact well see how that goes but that was a big W for the yellow jackets a has been 5 years as the head coach of Pacific couple of years on the Celtics staff who havent you worked with by the way when youre old youve worked with a lot of people I think you just attract a lot of good personality there you go thats what we can say so Georgia Tech with backtoback wins over ranked teams Mississippi State number 21 before that first time since the 201617 seasons Kai Dixon at the line 67 Jr from Canada tonight at 10 Eastern the nothing but neet crew will break down the day in the ACC with highlights and Analysis of all the mens games and look ahead at the best games on the schedule in the coming week thats coverage you can only find in one spot right here on acc Network and the ESPN app Jim beheim is now a media Personality yeah who would have thought that not me I heard R reviews though from him this weekend two two things in there you got media personality you got all kind of questions come up Im sure hell love it could be on the other side of those questions exactly Dixon hammered on his way to the cup we got some good Studio folks we you know you start mentioning youll leave somebody else but uh Luke Hancock does a good job and uh on the womens Side Kelly gramlick is is is as good as anybody I I I enjoy some of those shows the amateurs like me certainly learn a Music Applause Music lot cor Spector M McCarthy with you appreciate you stopping by on acc Network extra lavel Moten leaves this game and what exactly is he thinking well hes got a lot of film to show a lot of things to show this team that you know that you just cant simulate in practice and and I think hell hell feel a little sense of Pride too in the way they battled not the way they executed things uh that left something to be desired really on both ends they let McNeely get going to start with havent really gotten a lot of Great Looks offensively but they have battled the entire game whoever he has put in the game has played hard and look well acknowledge this right Beakmans not in the game at this juncture Isaac mcne hasnt played in a long time but again you look at just the second half numbers and right now NC Central in just the second half only Trails Virginia by eight yeah not a win but a win Music Applause right font lys free throw row is through Tristan how is in the game the walk on from Virginia Beach scored his first two points of the year against Syracuse back on Saturday that was very popular by the way watching that game oh yeah Bryce Walker is also in the Junior from Beltsville Maryland his first year on the roster spent a few years as a practice Applause player Murray I think he was looking for Walker instead Miner takes it cant score NC Central has it here with adiri Timmy adiri played the small ball five in the game against USC Upstate and hes just at Music Applause 64 in the absence of Manny zabor richir Senor from fville North Carolina whos been sick for the last two games and you know we talked about how Cleveland Harris and eunor are out tonight those are three starters but theyre also three guys who are now in their fifth year of college so theyve seen some Music things font looy is three good looking long range Applause shots B looy been playing pretty well 11 points the third eagle and double figures Harry Smith leads the club with 12 Applause Virginia looking to hit 80 points the second consecutive game Bryce Walker off the window too Applause strong overall the 40 minutes tonight Tony Bennett pretty pleased oh I think so I think so got off to a really good start he saw some contributions Off the Bench extended minutes for Gertrude and and he came through on with flying colors on on both ends of the floor Bond played well again Off the Bench roie showed that he can run the point if necessary and buenon comes off the bench and splinters the Music net Buchanan now with nine Canon s would be very helpful if he can get to the point where coach Bennett trusts him to to go in there and play well you Canon started a couple of games back Simon goes back to Jake Rose at the Five Spot shot clock at four font looy a tape measure job that goes out of bounds and so the shot clock goes dark and pretty much does it here from John Paul Jones Arena Music tonight Virginia probably wont shoot this basketball and so the Cavaliers improved to eight and one on the season the Eagles dropped to four six Isaac McNeely zaed the Eagles early with four threes on four tries finishes with 22 to tie his career high and Virginia in backto back years takes down NC Central tonight by a final score of 77 47 yeah Virginia
