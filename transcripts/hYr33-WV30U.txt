and we are ready for the tip of our Sonic Blockbuster matchup underway in Chapel Hill Duke winning the opening tip for M Ryan starting out on Tyrese Proctor put a little size on Proctor Proctor sounds like hes all the way back from that ankle injury that cost him some time they were without roach for a while Mitchell for a while what a matchup this figures to be filipowski and Bott and filipowski Strikes early as we show you the degree starting lineup for North Carolina Kad the freshman and then look at all the experience in the rest of the lineup with Davis Ryan Harrison Ingram having a great year and of course Armando B who lays it in well executed by North Carolina they set a little double Low cross screen with two guards and Armando bacot able to slip underneath it and was wide open and you can tell right away Duke is going to put Armando Bott in his many ball screens as they can proor no Carolina in transition RJ Davis what a pass ahead by North Carolinas transition game and that was not an easy shot by RJ Davis he just makes it look easy he can beat you from Beyond The Arc he can beat you at the free throw line and he can beat you in the midrange game as well filipowski right into the chest of Bott who wins the battle poor M Ryan the grad transfer from Notre Dame hes played at a bunch of games against Duke in his time with the Irish heres the Freshman kadu playing some really good basketball the last couple of weeks Armando Bott over his last three games only averaging a little bit under seven points a game over that stretch they cant forget about him Harrison Ingram misses the three yeah Hubert Davis and Armando Bott had a chat in his office in Daviss office and Bott was saying you know RJs having such a great year RJ this and RJ that and Hubert say wait a minute I want 20 from him I want 20 from you as well well they want to play inside out after the rebound by Harrison Ingram whos leading the ACC in ACC games in rebounding it just under 12 a game thats a spectacular pass ahead and what a difficult little midrange shot along the Baseline in the short corner by RJ Davis but he is so good at those midrange shots roach CH is screen knocks it down to tie the game theau trailing off that little pin down screen and I think that Jeremy roach is one of the best midrange Shooters not only in the ACC but in the country off whoa and roach goes flying checking out his left elbow and grimacing a little bit as he went high in the air and came down hard when youre hyped up thats when you need to be your most disciplined on defense just a simple little shot fake on the ball reversal and and Jeremy roach went flying right at cormack Ryan I think thats a foul Roach coming back he miss some time recently with a knee problem came off the bench the last couple of games but back in the starting lineup tonight so Caleb Foster will come off the bench for Duke Ryan good deep position by bacop Mitchell comes over to double team and de bot kicks it back out good job by Jeremy roach to make that catch difficult on the balls side tick by by filipowski still Carolina ball with five to shoot its really important for Kyle filipowski guarding Armando Bott one not the foul but to stay between him and the basket when Bott gets an angle hes going to score get fouled or Music both Ryan to inbound gets it into Davis who lays it in RJ Davis just never stops moving and he never changes expression when its going well when its not one of the hardest workers you will ever see 36 last week against wake 28 Tuesday in the loss to Georgia Tech Ingram wins the battle with Mitchell Carolina run it again that is Carolina basketball Armando Bott beating the opposing big guys down the floor oh and then an Aaron pass and Ingram lays it in Carolina by six John shy doesnt look like hes calling a timeout hes just saying to his guys settle down you want to play 100 Mil an hour on defense but you have to downshift on offense Proctor little stop and go and lays it in to quiet the crowd well since he came back from injury Tyrese Proctor is playing his best basketball almost 17 points a game over his last five air ball core M Ryan who has not shot the ball as well as hes capable of this year just 30 from three how about a strong drive and finish there from The Freshman Jared McCain who is playing great recently averaging over 15 a game his last 12 great pass kdo wide open Ryan and this time hell bury it for M Ryan was a lead dog for Mike Bray at Notre Dame he had 28 points against Duke in a game he is a mature player started his career at Stanford unafraid of the moment twoman game Proctor and filipowski he can pop and shoot he can spin but he doesnt finish here as he tried to take Bott off the dribble inside to Bott hes got to run it down just to save it and they turn it over just a tough angle to get that high low pass throwing it to Bott going away from the bucket Ingram comes over for the rejection Ingram wide open and misses the three Boy again Carolina J pushing at every opportunity and theyre doing it with their defense thats whats starting the break grabbing a rebound and then out letting it quickly but Harrison Ingram can rip and run he can grab that rebound and bring it up himself that makes Carolina even faster the transfer from Stanford Hubert Davis just loves him filipowski short on the three and that only gets him riled up even more here inside the Smith Center bot jump hook no Hubert Davis wants Armando Bott when he gets the ball in the low post in practice he says go to work he wants him to go to work and score inside and be a threat every time down theres five five and nine points points for Bott his last three games could do ahead to Davis Davis with the extra gear tipped by Ryan and Bott is fouled Carolinas defense has been Stellar to start this game theyve stayed between Duke and the basket and when they secure the ball after one challenged shot they are racing down the floor passing ahead putting a lot of pressure on Dukes transition defense of college basketball is brought to you by new Sonic peanut butter bacon shake and cheeseburgers its peanut butter bacon time at Sonic well the two head coaches of these teams Hubert Davis in his third year John shy in his second they could both relate of course to playing in this rivalry because they both did it a lot sh eight games Schubert got 11 because three of his four years these these two teams met at the ACC tournament they know what this feels like you know what this feels like what does this feel like J its a a feeling thats Indescribable and Hubert Davis and John shy were both great players Hubert Davis one of the best Shooters in ACC history and John shy I think the most underrated superstar in Duke basketball history probably should have had his number retired he scored over 2000 points won a National Championship in 2010 just a great great player John shy uh today at shooutout this morning talked about distractions just eliminate distractions focus on the game Hubert Davis at practice yesterday talked about shutting out the noise just focus on the game different words but the same message and in this day and age social media phones and so on its hard to do but both coaches trying to make sure their players just focus on what they have to do on the court well youre not going to shut out the noise in this building is going to be loud for 40 minutes or more Ryan young into the game Kyle filipowski has gone to the Ben Caleb Foster with the ball has checked in for Duke as well what a recovery by RJ Davis he was behind Caleb Foster off that screening action got back in front and knocked the ball Away by Carolinas defense the last 11 games has been Stellar Jeth Trimble has checked in kicks it to Harrison Ingram whos off to a great start tonight jayen Withers the gr transfer from Louisville is on the floor for the heels as well he loves back Downs in there but got two Defenders tremble a little bit strong and Foster Soares for the rebound Duke can give extra pressure by digging down cuz theyre not worried about Trimble knocking down a three he is not a great shooter from the perimeter roach around the screen from Young steps back leaves it short Mitchell with a putb thats the difficulty if youre not going to guard Mark Mitchell out on the perimeter he gets a run up to the glass you have to go find him and put your body on him he cant wait for him to get to you playing some really good basketball lately averaging almost 15 a game his last six 20 or more in three of those six games the pullup McCain had a pretty good look in transition McCains their best threepoint shooter and hes at his best shooting that ball in transition Bott spins the double comes he kicks Ingram yes what a great look opposite by Armando Bott when he got the double team Dukes keeping it from going out ballside but he just looked opposite and found Harrison Ingram roach into the paint and a soft touch looking for a foul as well as he knocks it down oh that wide pin down you have to lock and trail on his outside hip but what youre doing is running him off the threepoint line so thats a tough two pretty good match up here isnt it Davis and roach two guys who have been at this for a while in this rivalry and Ingram boy great save by by Withers as Ingram almost air air mailed it shot clock at seven thought Ingram was going to back down Caleb Foster into the low post Bon forced to put it up and knocks down along long two six in the early going for Armando Bok Harrison Ingram guarding Jared McCain little floppy action to try to free up Jeremy roach against Seth Trimble Buster into the pain left hand and a strong finish he rejected the screen they were trying to ice it to the side force him to his left and he took it and how about the heels and tremble getting down the court quickly again the Carolinas transition game has been on point thats after a made bucket theyre beating Duke down the floor and up Caleb Foster was on his back after making that bucket but still and whenever anybody plays Carolina its always discussed hey you got to get back in transition and slow him down young with a bucket and John Shire is waving his guys back with as much energy as he can telling him to get back down on deep with that high ball screen action if you dont have a weak side Defender coming over to tag Ryan Young on that roll to the basket Dukes going to cut him up in the half court right in the middle of the floor got some mismatches right now Mitchells on Trimble Fosters on Ingram Ingram spin shot clocks at two and here comes McCain roach from the wing count it a three to bring him back within a point Bo and that was with Harrison Ingram flying right by what a great shot by Jeremy roach Duke doesnt get up and down the floor the way that Carolina does they play at a relatively slow tempo but they were really strong in transition there bacock the spin and the reverse thats the problem when you to give Armando Bott that angle Duke decided not to send another Defender to double team Bott and he got the angle to get to the rim on Ryan young and Kyle filipowski has been sitting at the scores table for several minutes waiting to check in along with Tyrese proor but there hasnt been a whistle well that quick Outlet Carolinas racing up the floor Davis looked like there might have been a little contact in transition they play on and back come the Blue Devils a little bit of contact in this game is not going to cut it there have been a total of two fouls called in this game both on Duke two fouls called maybe more committed Withers knocks it away shot clock at 10 McCain again seeking out the paint seeking out the traffic that time had it knocked away what a defensive job by jayen Withers oh and B gotot Brew it behind Withers it bounced to Davis and Trimble misses the three theres some tired legs I think already right now they theyve played about 5 six minutes without a whistle and continue to Roach pulls up for three and ties the game Armando bot basically playing in drop coverage which means hes not up with the screener and Jeremy Roach just able to pick off his Defender and get that shot easily Davis short on the floater McCain a strong rebound Duke looking for the lead young lost it Withers ahead to Trimble spins and hits another spectacular pass ahead by North Carolina and Trimble whos a fantastic athlete and a great defender little Kenny Smith in that spin there the jet used to do that all the time back in the 80s Foster with a clean look and Trimble skies for the Applause rebound Bott left hand to strong and Duke ball bot doesnt miss many of those foster no and a foul on bot Applause North Carols transition early in this game has been excellent and the high ball screen Armando Bott in drop coverage he just pulls up for the easy three in Rhythm but when North Carolinas grabbed a rebound or gotten a steal they are going the other way in a hurry what a great spin move by Seth Applause Trimble we talked about RJ Davis having a first team All America kind of season so is that fell right there Dalton connect and you can make a case for Antonio Reeves getting all America consideration as well well those are the two leading candidates and I would argue only candidates for SEC player of the year right now and Dalton connect his last six games is averaging 32 points per game Rick Barn doesnt want his other players standing around watching connect work they got to get involved especially if they want to beat Kentucky in Ru Armando Bott is on the bench he was called for a foul before uh that last stoppage and he was talking to a member of the the medical or training staff for the heels throughout the timeout jayen Washington who has played very well recently in limited minutes he is in now and he is defending Kyle filipowski he played very well in his limited minutes against Georgia Tech had a big time dunk in traffic in that game but I think filipowski is got to go right at him and it looks like hes thinking about it and but he never got the shot off was not aware of the shot clock Timeout on the floor 713 to go Heels by two Big 4 minute segment got a chance to catch our bre catch our breath and the job weve done on Davis is huge keep guarding Davis dont put him on the okay play show our hands we got it keep big fourminute segment John sh says again hes played in these game obviously coached in a couple last year and won them both hes working up a lather over on the bench Jay well right now this fourminute segment at least the start of it North Carolinas got a number of substitutes in hbert Davis wants to keep his starters fresh he plays a lot of guys Trimble strong Baseline Drive yeah no Bott still and no RJ Davis on the floor right now for Carolina but you have to play Seth Trimble for the drive hes not going to pull the trigger on that shot and stepping in and committing the foul is Jaylen Withers Jaylen Withers transferred into North Carolina from Louisville where hes one of Louisvilles top scorers hes an outstanding athlete and hit 43s for the Cardinals last year but he provides a different dimension with his athleticism and his ability to switch but hes guarding Kyle filipowski now and filipowski has got some size on him you think filipowski is going to roll him down into the post filipowski two points two rebounds but again hes only played 6 minutes because of that incredibly long stretch where he and others were waiting to check in but there werent any whistles Proctor among them hes back in there now Trimble on him from the elbow and the long rebound kicks out to Roach Foster stumbling out of control and still gets it to go out of control and then got himself in control to make that shot crowd wanted to travel looked like he got rid of it in time dont you think what a recovery though to make that shot too and hell go to the free throw line Foster called for the foul there have been precious few free throws in this ball game to this point and thats where North Carolina makes their living they shoot over 22 free throws a game but what a recovery to beat the shot clock by Caleb Foster so Elliot kadoo The Freshman from West Orange New Jersey is at the line have been playing really well lately last four games averaging about 11 points five assists per game had 16 and six against Florida State last week but over his last two games Elliot kog is six of 19 from the field but he is nine of 10 from the foul line over those two games and knocks down his first one and anytime you play North Carolina because they attack inside side and attack the paint they want to get to the foul line they can be devastating from the free throw line the good free throw shooting team especially RJ Davis fourpoint lead Carolina roach was looking for a foul call on Trimble didnt get it a good ball pressure here by kdo and want to send him to his weak hand Ryan with a Ste and a chance for three this is a different level of Defense from North Carolina than we saw earlier in the season it looked like cor M Ryan when he shot the Gap here to get that wounded duck of a pass that was deflected looked like he was taken that into dunk but got hit and still completed the play and theres the emotion you see in a Duke North Carolina Applause game Jay that was Dukes fifth turnover Carolinas only coughed it up once and Carolina has turned those five Duke turnovers into eight points thats really one of the statistical differences in the game so far and why we said that the lead story with North Carolina is not their offense this year it is their defense top five of the nation in defensive efficiency per kenon as Wasington is called for the foul Bott coming back into the game this we speaked for Carolina after sitting for a few minutes and with the way in North Carolina substitutes and always had always has it keeps the starters fresh lots of banging between these two and a fade away by Philip owski will go pal filipowski down in the low post he likes to spin off but not many big guys are making Fade Away jumpers like that Theo picks up his dribble now gets it back from Ingram no pull up for a long jumper and the rebound down to McCain roach is wide open and Carolina catches a break there just lack of communication in transition Gau into the chest of roach and a block is called and thats what Carolina needs to do more of especially in transition attack the paint now filipowski oneonone in the post just a little back down and thats a a big time shot fading away over one of the better shot blockers in the ACC in Armando Bott so cadoo back to the free throw line the foul on Jeremy roach was his second Caleb Foster is at the scores table well find out after this free throw whos coming out and it is indeed roach so he may sit for the final 440 of the half you know Dan that last possession that was good defense by arando Bott he forced Kyle filipowski into a fadea away tough two and filipowski made it you know sometimes you just have to take your hat off to to good offense but he forced him into a tough two one of two for kdo and Carolina leads by five Carolina forcing Duke up at the top to move to their left forc him to their weak hand boy somehow McCain just kept on going and found a lane Jared McCain is just a winner I mean he is having a terrific year over his last 12 games hes averaging just under 16 points a game shooting 50 from the field and over 40 from fre ACC rookie of the week last week playing more containment on the perimeter Ingram knocks down the three and it was the burst of speed of kadoo that moved the defense and opened up some space for Ingram well thats what he does kadoo is a penetrating point guard and now a turnover kadoo has it and well go to the free throw line again they cant even hear the whistle did they call a foul yeah they did the players kept going cuz nobody can hear the whistle I couldnt hear it Applause Music either Harrison Ingram having a great first half here for Carolina hes got eight points six rebounds already in this game and Carolina maintaining a lead here in the first half ESPNs exclusive present ation of college basketball is brought to you by Ensure nutrition for strength and Applause Music Applause Music energy the Jeep halftime report is coming up number one Yukon wins again Kansas defeats Houston at Allen Fieldhouse and for a preview of the Jeep halftime report Jess is with the fellas yes I am both fellas that chose Duke so Im curious is Seth as a former coach as someone who knows John sh what would you see be saying to your team right now in that timeout right now were fine we just got to take care better care of the basketball and take better shots if we do those two things then we can set our defense and take Carolina at a defensive transition the games a marathon just play One play at a time but we must take care of the ball Jay how do you feel about that I would agree with that I think also Kyle Phil palski has a chance when Armando botts in the game pick and roll when hes not in the game put him down low on the Block let him actually be aggressive off defensively they need points in the paint from filipowski thank you so much guys got it just thank you kdo is at the line about to take Carolinas ninth free throw their ninth free throw attempt of the game he makes them both theyre only five of nine but the point is theyve been there nine times Duke has not been to the free throw line yet in this game well Carolina only one turnover Duke has six largest lead of the game for the heels the laow misses the three bot the uncontested rebound and it has been one shot and out for Duke RJ Davis who got up to a very quick start hes got Caleb Foster The Freshman on him he had two early baskets but still at Four Points now as kdo really has been the most assertive guy offensively for the heels in recent minutes really good Pace off that side ball screen to get into the lane he didnt blast off that screen just read the defense McCain Cuts beautifully and lays it in well he cut off that screen instead of going over the screen he went under it read the defense very effectively on that cut and Duke doing a better job getting back and transition on this trip got a switch now Caleb Fosters on bacot Bott wants the ball now he has it here comes the help Mitchell came over bothered the shot Ryan for three well what a job by Mitchell but bot kicked it out and they got an open three as a result of it this is a good passing North Carolina team McCain a step back free how about that shot used his off arm and one of the officials telling Jared McCain keep quiet he had a little talking to do to cormack Ryan after nailing that three McCains got nine points and seven rebounds already in this game for the Blue Devil well hes an outstanding guard rebounder and Jared McCain had 10 rebounds against Virginia Tech to go with his nine points in that win that Duke had in blackburg Jeremy roach is back in with two minutes to go in the half playing with two fouls Tyrese Proctor whos been quiet so far and this one back to the Applause bench a twoman game with Bott now they sent a double gdo wide open hell take it tipped out by Ryan and a fresh possession for the heels what a pass by kadoo and Ingram with a free double figures for Ingram hes got 11 what a pass by Elliot kdo and give credit to cormack Ryan for keeping that ball alive so his teammate kadoo could get it third assist of the game for the Freshman kadoo Foster and the follow by filipowski its almost like Foster just threw that up knowing that when bacock came over filipowski was going to have the glass wide open bot over filipowski Banks it in and hes into double figures well you cant ask anything more from filipowski he made Bott take a tough shot in the middle of the lane roach into the paint cradles it misses it and Bon another rebound excellent job by RJ Davis defensively to stay in front and force the really difficult shot in the lane Low cross screen they did not switch and then a screen for the screener action Bott nice pass kdo sees some space they C the follow boy all set up by a good pass under of the double team by Armando B North Carolina has made great decisions on the offensive end Elliot kadoo just a freshman with a spectacular pass to Harrison Ingram for that corner three and then Armand Bott doing some work inside and doing it on the glass where hes North Carolinas all all time leading Applause rebounder coached by Dean Smith Dean Smith correct well I dont need to say correct you I say correct yeah sorry you dont tell me Im correct Dan I tell you I final seconds of the half got a switch and Bott got a piece of it what great defense by Armando Bott did not fight on the shot fake by Tyrese Proctor after he got switched off on him Carolinas defense was spectacular they forc turnover proor starting out on RJ Davis Mitchell switched off on him the double comes to B open is kadu shot fake step in bot the rebound and the put back Welly you just cant leave the floor on a shot fake from Elliot Kad you close out short and take away the drive but kdo gets into the lane and opens everything up for the offensive glass for Armando Bott cuz you have to come over and stop that drive McCain open misses the three Ingram has it well Ingram is just a monster on the glass the best rebounder in the conference in ACC games and playing with the best rebounder in North Carolina history in Armando bot ask Hubert Davis what do you like about Harrison Ingram and Hubert bursts into a huge smile and says everything and then you ask him for more he talks about his smile his impact on the culture of this team and then he talks about the rebounding as well and why wouldnt he kdo wide open they dared him to take it and it rims out cror did a great job on RJ Davis just staying with him not helping off thats size on RJ Davis because hes 65 and long arm the lowski and a foul ellot kadoo catches the ball on the left wing and because hes trying to double the post Jared McCains got to recover out he recovered not taking away middle and then left the floor on a simple shot fake by kadoo hes got a close out short take away the drive you can put late pressure on that shot if he decides to take it hes a reluctant threepoint shooter and the first free throw attempt of the game for the Blue Devils goes down for Kyle filipowski I dont think Duke can put Kyle filipowski in enough ball screens pull Armando Bott away from the basket if he stays too long on the ball youve got filipowski in a pick and pop situation a short roll or getting all the way to the rim John shy said early he likes him to roll to establish that part of his game but he said after that let him hop as much as he wants hes shooting the three better than he did last year 28 last year 37 this year Davis bouncing off a couple of Defenders just four in the half for the accs leading score as he is fouled on the drive so difficult to stay in front of RJ Davis hes got a great handle I mean North Carolina and Duke does the same thing but they play two point guards kads a point guard but RJ Davis is a point guard as well hes just a point guard thats an unbelievable scorer j3 on Proctor John shy is going to leave them but thats a thats a decision that has to be made a tough one that you have to make at this point of the game you want to leave one of your best players in there if you can mismatch in the post Kau wide open again a good job by Jared McCain to guard Bon on that switch and Come Away with the rebound whoa what a shot to bring Duke a little bit closer majoring in English McCain into double figures Ingram with the answer at the other end with a three North Carolina has three threepoint Shooters Davis Ryan and Ingram nobody found Ingram in transition Ingram now with 14 and8 already in this game and hes got four threes in this game hit all three of Carolinas threes in the first half and then knocks one down in transition in the second the little ball fake I mean you dont get that much time to shoot in a game of horse transfer from Stanford the last couple of years made exactly 36 threes in each season with the four hes made tonight hes got 40 already this year roach he knew he missed it charges after it and gets the rebound oh that was a foul wow Duke will take the dunk by filipowski yeah Carolina would have been better off if they called that foul those are two big strong aggressive Guys bacon and Philip house banging all night got a switch on the dribble handoff now its Mitchell on Davis going to get a ball screen Davis and what a recovery and block by Mitchell not any guys in America Jay at his size can do that on a player of the caliber of Davis Ingram with a steal theyre running again and then bacot gives it right back just a bad decision to give it to Bott at that point in the floor and Mitchell is headed to the free throw line with thats quite a turnaround a great steal by North Carolina on a poor post pass on Dukes end and then they pitch It Away by giving it uh like this is a foul theres no question about I mean you kidding me is that legal guarding position and incidental contact come on but fortunate for Duke they didnt call that Mitchell at the line again a guy who has taken his offense to another level recently averaging almost 15 a game over his last six games he missed a couple of games with a knee injury one of the Duke losses the home loss to pit which is their only loss in the last 11 games I believe it is they were without Mark Mitchell and without Jeremy roach John Shire is encouraged by the fact that theyve had the season theyve had and Jay theyre about the healthiest theyve been right now with Proctor Mitchell and roach all pretty much close to 100 well Mitchell shooting about 60 in ACC games Ryan into Bott and a foul on Philip howski well Bott doing a great job of establishing position with two feet in the paint and when he gets it that deep as a big guy what you really want to do is post so deep you dont have to make a post move you catch it on the block or off the block you got to make a post move you catch it that deep you just go straight up with Applause it number two on filipowski Bott shooting an impressive 79 from the line this year by far the best of his Applause Music career tomorrow a womens basketball triple header on ESPN 2 in the app it begins with Virginia Tech taking on North Carolina then number one South Carolina hosting Miss and finally UCLA and fourth ranked Stanford Stanford took a loss to USC last night Juju Watkins with 51 for usfc great womens triple header tomorrow Juju Watkins is the next truly great womens basketball Superstar the lead is 10 roach from the elbow what a tough shot over Armando Bott in drop coverage Seth Trimble got picked off trying to go over the top of that high ball screen roach with a dozen to lead the blue devs Ingram quick release and he knocks down another one his fifth three of the game you think hes feeling it and how about RJ Davis when he got the switch trusting Harris Ingram and giving him the ball McCain floats it up and it somehow goes soft touch with the left hand for the Freshman Jared McCain averages over 12 points per game and shoots over 40 from three but he has done a great job getting into the paint just makes winning plays Another Touch for bacock left hand and yes well Duke looks like its coming with the double team when Bott puts it on the deck and when he did he just turned to the Baseline side away from the double team this is the Bott Carolina knows and this is the Bott Carolinas been looking for in recent games and they are certainly getting it here tonight Duke Duke has been switching with Mark Mitchell on to RJ Davis they get the switch and he immediately looks to Harrison Ingram for that corner three hes got five of those and look how Bott turns away from the double team and puts up the lefthanded Music hook nothing comes close to this place in the morning Im so glad I can still come here you see I was diagnosed floor and guys getting tangled up trying to help up their teammates and eventually you focus in on Philip and Ingram getting tangled up with one another and jawing at one another just a little bit you get a better look from this angle Ingram took exception to something and then filipowski took exception to that uh the officials looked at the Monitor and determined nothing unto as the great Louie carnosa the coach at St Johns used to say it was a Subway push Carolina by 11 here in the second half to despite the leading score with the ACC RJ Davis only four two for seven tonight Bott and Ingram have combined for 35 what a great job by Seth Trimble to stay in front of Caleb Foster on that drive McCain and he knocks down another one hes done an outstanding job putting the ball on the deck tonight well Duke is getting into the lane and theyre finishing some plays in this second half now Duke in a little Applause Zone Corner three wont go for Jaylen Withers who then slipped but appears to be okay so Tree Top question weve talked about Carolina being so much better defensively this year than they have been in recent years why is that the case in your opinion well after they gave up 87 points in each of their games against Yukon and Kentucky and did it backto back in two losses I think they realized that theyre not going to outscore people with this team theyre going to have to get stops and they are are getting stops yet another one tremble with a beautiful look ahead to Davis boy points off turnovers have been all Carolina it is now 122 in points off turnovers easy baskets by doing something really difficult really well filipowski open for a three tremble what a rebound and when he grabs the rebound he can bring it up on his own Withers will head to the free throw line Carolinas transition attack whether after a make or a Miss has been Relentless that looks like it should count as a turnover for Duke and it turns into an easy basket on the other end for RJ Davis who hasnt seen many openings in this game Duke is dedicated a Defender to him that is not helping off most of the time its been Tyrese Proctor Mark Mitchell switched off on him on dribble handoffs the occasional screen hes coming off so heres Withers the grab transfer from Louisville averaging about 4 and 12 points three and 1 half rebounds per game only playing about 9 minutes but this is a guy who started 64 games with the Cardinals this is a very experienced and a talented player he has a different dimension when he plays like the athlete he is you know hes a good rebounder hes got length hes good at The Rim I think I mentioned he had 43s last year for Louisville you saw filipowski and Bott both going to the bench Withers will sit after the free throws Ryan back in and with the Wayne North Carolina substitute stand they can stay fresh for all 40 minutes a lot of new bases on this team it is a deeper team or at least one where Hubert Davis appears more comfortable using more bodies this year another turnover Carolina is swarming to the ball on that short roll Ryan young caught it and he had three Carolina bodies surrounding him with nowhere to go ninth Duke turnover and just as impressively as you see the heels have turned it over only twice Ingram the rebound and the jumper and its a 15point lead for Carolina Harrison Ingram is on fire what a game hes having his mom looking on with delight here in Chapel Hill 19 points five made threes in eight attemp nine rebounds four steals an assist and a block again doing everything that Hubert Davis could ever ask of a player to help his team wi Harrison Ingram is doing it tonight and hes doing it in front of family with more heres j s yes Dan hes doing it in front of his his mom and his sister and his sister Lauren is actually a freshman at Duke and he went to support her in quite a few of her volleyball games over there and he said he learned a very hard lesson early he walked in with a Carolina shirt so tonight he said um I had to go back into my car and change so tonight you need to wear my jersey year yeah thats tough when one student when you got siblings and one is a student athlete for Duke and one is a student athlete for Carolina but you got to support family wait dan how about the combination of a Rondo aott and Harrison Ingram 37 points 18 rebounds 15 of 21 from the field they have been dominant in a game where RJ Davis is just three of nine with six points so heres what John sh is looking to do coming out of the time out a little pressure to try to shake things up one two two three quarter court press not necessarily to force a turnover but take time off the clock and forc Carolina to play in the half court Davis Around Philip owski Washington with a rebound and puts it back up and in if filipowski has to help out and guard RJ Davis thats going to open up the offensive glass and Washington took advantage of it Washington is a very talented young player but again playing behind Bott just doesnt get very many minutes but he is a hes a real nice piece on this team for Hubert Applause Davis just got a whistle for the foul is second that middle ball screen action in the slot is awfully difficult to guard because weak side help has to come from a long way and you got to leave a threepoint shooter in order to help Proctor to inbounds for Duke 1225 to go 14point lead heels into filipowski filipowski again and somehow gets that to go and kind of waves his hands up in the air looking for a foul call that he didnt get he absorbed a bump but hes having to take a lot of tough twos hes got 11 points in this game but two of them have been fall aways really difficult shots over Armando Bott Ingram into Bott roach cheating over theres the double the open man Trimble bothered from behind by Proctor needed to shoot it right away he allowed Proctor to push him right underneath the rim nice pass roach finds Mitchell for the slam and a little spark here for the visitors the side ball screen a twoman game now with Bott and Davis McCain over for the double 10 to shoot Ingram with space knocks down another one this one a twopointer hes got 21 spectacular Harrison Ingram has been absolutely spectacular McCain and Ingram down with a rebound that is his 10th 21 and 10 already for Harrison Ingram good job by cormack Ryan to give that little pass fake that could have been picked off if he just tried to reverse it not this time for Ingram the signal from Roger aers is that Ingram kicked out his legs that he wasnt fouled and roach lays it in at the other end well with Ingram on his back Duke had numbers and Jeremy roach took advantage of it but 10 down with 10 minutes to go this is about getting stops on the road Davis with six Carolina leads by 10 Trimble boy he just knocked McCain right out of bounds and then finished it thats eight points for Trimble could have been 10 if hed finished that earlier one when he got pushed onto the basket but his defense has been excellent as well Proctor with a step back Duke needs him McCain the offensive rebound well McCains got double figure rebounds as well does he filipowski Strong finish right into the chest of Bot well you take away one shoulder and he spins right to the other just a great drop step against pretty good defense by Armando Bott he had to finish over him and to answer your question yes its a double double for Jared McCain 15 10 I got a switch Mitchell is on Davis and Proctor had to switch off on Ingram and a foul before the shot on Kyle filipowski Bott has been a man rolling down into the low post middle of the lane nothing you can do ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is brought to you by new Sonic peanut butter bacon shake and cheeseburgers its peanut butter bacon time at Music Sonic NCAA tournament and theres the the 76 behind only Tim Duncan Ralph Samson you know granted fifth year so that has helped allow him to continue to put up great numbers but he continues to put up great numbers as we take a look at tonights principal wooden watch and these two are two of the 20 players on the wooden award late season watch list and deservedly so just an amazing career for Armando Bott he is a Workhorse and is just relentless on the glass and I like how aggressive that hes been in the post in this game hes calling for the ball and hes a Target in there and that can loosen things up for the perimeter and his teammates but right now Dan Carolinas got 16 fouls and Duke has to continue to drive the ball but they they have a Carolina has not allowed a three from Duke in this second half Carolinas playing extremely well with both ends with the floor tonight Trimble looking inside hell have to put it up from the Baseline and the loose ball rebound down to Mark Mitchell as duke tries to get it into single digits Carolina only two turnovers in this game thus far good fake the leowski lost it and its Carolina ball and thats turnover number 10 for the Blue Devils they have been a low turnover team they average just under 10 on the season but its the margin that is remarkable and you can see that eight turnover margin and the points off turnovers 142 yeah because eight of the 10 turnovers have been live ball turnovers that was one of the two that wasnt live ball turnovers often wind up in layups at the other end cant defend a run out Davis oh he draws a crowd doesnt he it came off that fade screen and CER went over the top Bott finds him and Davis knocks down his first three of the game even though this has not been RJ Daviss best scoring game his defense hasnt changed and his expression hasnt changed he just keeps working keeps getting better every year Philip hsky with a much needed three for Duke 610 with a step back in Carolina coming back in transition well even after a made field goal they get it up the floor so quickly but Bott with a terrific pass to RJ Davis and just a slow rotation to get to him and filipowski with a step back dribble to the threepoint line on Armando Bott and nearing the 8 Minute Mark John sh has brought filipowski to the bench probably briefly Ryan young has checked back in yeah just get him a little more rest before the next media timeout gdo turns on the Jets but lost it he was trying to draw contact but McCain held his ground roach frees himself and knocks down the midrange jumper to make it an eightpoint game thats his spot and usually Jeremy roach likes doing that from the left side of the floor with a right hand dribble McCain going under that screen hes not worried about kdo pulling the trigger on a three now Ingram you better guard kdo bounce pass out to Ingram 10 to shoot now Davis leans in in missed it tipped and Carolina gets it back Ryan the shot clock did not reset thats why he hoisted it here comes Proctor McCain misses a three and Davis has a much needed rebound for the Tar Heels bodies are flying and the reason its Duke in Carolina Bott having a big Applause night and willll be going to the line oneonone in the post he decided to take Ryan young right into the lane to draw that Music foul this what its all about you better check this out lets go Duke in Carolina the first of two regular season meetings and all kinds of Carolina royalty in the house here in Chapel Hill including Larry Brown Luke and leaky leaky on the left thats leaky black and Luke May two great players recently here in Carolina I saw Antoine Jameson before there are tons of T Tyler hansbro is here and boy they are seeing just a terrific effort from the current version of the North Carolina Tar Applause Hills dont forget there is another top 10 matchup coming right after this game from rup Arena Dalton connect whos averaging 32 a game over his last six 32 he will lead the balls into Lexington right Duke right now down 10 and they are out shooting North Carolina 52 to 49 and out rebounding the tar Hills but the difference has been turnovers and Harrison Ingram the lowski open for a three not close he is now 1 for six from threepoint range tonight hes 6 for eight from twopoint range 16 on the game Carolina was icing that side action and Duke just went down to the Baseline and threw back to filipowski but he missed everything now Jeremy roach guarding RJ Music Davis they CAU the hand off to Ryan four on the shot clock off the glass no and a great effort by Ingram to the dick to save it and kick it back out what an amazing play by Harrison Ingram that was an amazing play by Ingram and it winds up with a Cormac Ryan three roach with a layup at the other end but it is still Carolina by 11 boy when that ball has been loose or long North Carolina has snatched it thats a big time winning play by Harrison Ingram who has played a ton of minutes in this game 33 to be exact hes played more minutes than anybody on either side Davis bumped by roach they call these 5050 balls Harrison Ingram keeping it alive first to the deck and then has the presence of mind to kick it out and Carolina doesnt just reset they attack and the great pass from RJ Davis could have taken it himself but corack Ryan had that corner three thats big Applause time and now the officials have gone to the Monitor and it appeared to me as if it was Hubert Davis asking them to go well filipowski gave Davis a shot after that foul was called and there was contact filipowski made contact with his head watch after the fouls called This is that play again that amazing just loose ball kicking it out that ultimately wound up with the threepoint shot by cormack Ryan wide open in the corner got that high release his beautiful form and just watched it sail through the net but after RJ Davis was fouled you know filipowski gave him a shot I believe thats what the officials must be looking at and it was Hubert Davis and the rest of the Carolina coaches who were signaling for it and that the left arm the whistle had already blown the foul had already been called and the left arm there by filipowski will that warrant a flagrant one well it wouldnt be a FL its same thing it wouldnt be a flavor one it would be a dead ball nonc cont technical but its the same result you know North Carolina would would get an additional couple of free throws but I I dont see considering it was above the shoulders and contact with the head its hard to argue that was necessary contact thats unnecessary and again its the play had been alone dead Applause already and the officials say nothing they are not assessing anything additional on Kyle filipowski Duke Carolina baby no blood no Applause foul so just the common foul on Jeremy roach is third and its Carolina ball with 523 to go and an 11point lead remember Carolina lost their last game Tuesday at Georgia Tech but they have played at such a high level at both ends of the floor here in this one Applause tonight that was just the 16 foul for Duke so no free throws on that foul committed on RJ Davis before the post whistle contact little back door cut to Davis filipowski got a piece of it Duke has it a tight window McCain big three the assist to Proctor and Dukes got it down to eight that was a huge bucket and we talked about Jared McCain in transition hes an excellent threepoint shooter sets his feet so quickly hes having a terrific night as well 18 points 10 rebounds bacock and one well he took a shot across the face as well but Armando Bott just spun Baseline off of the contact filipowski was trying to keep him out of the middle of the lane hes just backing him into the middle and then he just spins off that contact with a great drop step and how about the lefthanded finish through that contact never took his eyes off the rim and he can complete the threepoint play filipowski picking up his fourth that takes away a little aggressiveness from the Duke big guy in the last 449 of Regulation what an answer by Carolina after that three by McCain and what a night for Armando B 23 points and nine rebounds well he had three straight uncharacteristic games where he was under double figures in three straight yeah more points tonight than those three combined boy Ingram is everywhere defensively Mitchell launces the three and its Carolina ball Carolinas been rebounding with all five guys nobody leaking out the other way give and go Trimble from Bott oh you turn your head that old give and go as you put it still works doesnt it McCain from the elbow Mitchell battling for the rebound out of bounds to the heels a great job by North Carolina to close out on McCain and take away the threepoint shot get him inside that line make him take a tough two now watch Mitchell turns his head and Trimble is gone what a great cut by Seth Trimble who has had a fabulous game his defense has been terrific and hes been so aggressive cutting Ryan gets it over has it knocked away it stay G with Carolina want to keep it off the sideline when you get it on the sideline Duke can bring that trap the sideline acts essentially as a third Applause Defender four minutes to go in a double digigit lead for the Tarheels back screen by RJ Davis to get Bott into the low post RJ Davis finds an open Elliot CAU and rebound Mitchell roach around Ryan too strong filipowski know and bacon wraps it up for his 10th rebound of the game Carolina has made Duke finish at The Rim taking him off the threepoint line they forced them to be twopoint players and individual Playmakers in this second half Bott swings it and Ingram was standing out of bounds when he caught the pass so itll be Duke ball with 311 to go but Carolina still with a double digit lead lost both games to the Blue Devils last year try to make sure that that streak ends here tonight and with a ton of emotion the house here at the dean doome they are high stepping and having fun and playing great basketball and leading Duke late by Music 13 its a two loss week for a really good team they both lost earlier this week another great matchup coming your way with Tom Hart and Jimmy Dykes right after us also more ACCC action Wednesday night of the ACC Network itll be Louisville Syracuse at 7 Eastern and then Notre Dame is at Cameron indor at 9 Eastern filipowski muscles his way in and draws the foul 18 points now for filipowski and Duke is setting those ball screens in the slot and once that screen is set Armando Bott has to stay to stop the ball then recover and filipowski just is able to Pivot his way around and go into his body to pick up the foul but more importantly for filipowski made the bucket and completes the threepoint play to make it a 10point game now Duke is going to have to bring full court pressure the Carolina playing with two point guards with RJ Davis and Elliot kadoo and cormack Ryan a good ball handler as well textbook job there by the heels to get it over now they can afford to burn some clock they dont want to take their foot off the gas but at the same time theres no reason into be in a hurry Kau with filipowski on him Bott with McCain on him filipowski over to help Davis gets free and RJ Davis knocks down a huge three to make it a 13point lead when the ball went inside excellent split action between kadoo and Davis to free him up for that three you cant let that come out on the balls side boy bot Force filipowski into another tough shot and another guard coming down to help rebound theyre not just letting Ingram and Bott do all the rebounding its been a team effort on the glass for North Carolina and whos hands would you rather have the ball in late in the game than RJ Davis Carolinas number one free throw shooter in tarhill history 92 from the line this season Kau misses the three Mitchell the rebound but its down to a minute 45 to go Carolina has to continue to guard the threepoint line they need quick buckets and a foul is called on kadoo which will send McCain to the line for three part of the rule is you have to let the player land and kadoo went into him didnt foul as the shot was being released it was after it was released just stuck his body into him so that McCain couldnt come down and Hubert Davis is consoling Kad over there he keeps saying over and over its okay its okay well no matter the mistake and that was a mistake you have to move on to the next play Focus your mind on the next play what happened on the last play isnt going to help you make the next play at all positive or negative how tough is mcain been in this game yeah I was just thinking that overshadowed a little bit by some of the performances by the Tar Heels but hes been mag magificent as well how about 20 and Applause 10 made them all but its still a 10point deficit in just a minute 40 to go Carolina just has to be strong with the ball when they catch it have to expect contact and Duke gives up the Applause Music foul Elliot kdo to the line for 1 and one just 63 on the season but five for six from the line Applause tonight these are the kind of pressure free throws you need at the end of a game to salt a game away when you have a lead doesnt get it Duke needs scores and in a Music hurry Mitchell spinning on Ingram itll go somehow to make it an eightpoint game and a timeout is called tough take by Mark Mitchell laying off him he just took up that space Carina tonight it starts with Armond B 23 points and 10 rebounds in this game also by the way five assists he has passed beautifully out of the double team and then Harrison Ingram has been just as good 21 points 12 rebounds I know hes got at least four steals in this game you got two guys on the same team in the same game putting up 20 10 double doubles you got a pretty good chance of winning theyve combined for 44 points 22 rebounds six assists and they are combined 17 of 24 from the field and that includes five of nine from three for Harrison Ingram you talk about a front Court dominating a game Ingram and Bott have dominated this game and you saw that the first first pair of teammates with 20110 double doubles in the same game since Vince Carter and anine Jameson that is Carolina royalty right there Jameson is here speaking of Carolina royalty all Roy the Hall of Fame coach and another foul so Dukes going to make Carolina earn it at the free throw line but RJ Davis is the last guy you want to send to the line and you know that in the timeout that John Shire called to stop the clock that Hubert Davis was telling his team lets get the ball in the hands of RJ Davis Duke fouls Davis and youve got a 90 free throw shooter headed to the line and uh a player thats having a spectacular year that has ice water in his Applause veins really a guy over four years first year eight points per game like a a good solid role player then became a starter then became a star and now is playing about as well as anybody in the nation I think Zach Ed still has a fairly comfortable lead for National player of the year but RJ if youre going to bring anybody else into the conversation you better bring this guy in pretty quickly yeah RJ Davis is one of the next names thats going to come up I mean Zach Eds got it on his shelf right now you have to take it from him roach with a layup Applause and North Carolina right now is thinking no threes no fouls and then inbound the ball cleanly and be strong with it Ryan double teamed did he get tied up yes he did and the possession arrow favors Duke now thats where you have to be smart and call a timeout if you get in trouble you always have a timeout guarding the threepoint line now is everything if you give up a two you dont want to give up anything but if you give up a two thats one thing you do not want to give up a three McCain all the way to the rim knocked away from behind and Davis has it for the heels what a play by cormack Ryan he thats the kind of gamewinning play that you need late cormack Ryan blocking that from behind with his right hand and saving a bucket and sending Carolina to the free line thats a big time block by the transfer from Notre Dame who started his career at Stanford playing for Jared Applause has six year senior 25 years old one of the oldest players in college basketball and he has enjoyed the opportunity that he has got transferring here playing in games of this caliber 25 years old you think they call him pops a rare rare Miss for RJ Applause Davis but unfazed he never changes expression what a player final minute ninepoint lead roach shakes Bott misses the three and a foul underneath and RJ Davis is shaken up looks like he took a shot to the face and I think they called the foul on Davis they did grabbing on to filipowski trying to block him out thats a second shot hes taken from Applause filipowski and the officials will look at it so the personal foul the common foul is on Davis and they called that on Davis now he took a shot he took took a shot from Trimble too maybe thats what got him but how is that on Davis filipowski arm was around his neck yeah it looks like thats where the Poss the problem came from but thats a curious foul to call on RJ Davis I mean you know hes not holding on to anybody hes getting held on to yeah the left elbow of Trimble I think is what got Davis in the face and he is still down now being helped up and on a night where there has been so many positive things for these tarhill fans thats the best news of the night seeing that guy walk off the court under his own power and listen to the champ hes had quite a career here if if he keeps going like hes going and they have a decent run RJ Davis has a chance to wind up as one of the five highest scoring Tarheels in program history just perpetual motion and even after taking that shot he hasnt changed expression one of the toughest players youre going to find in this league unless un and now the officials are calling in the coaches hook and hold are they calling a hook and hold on RJ Applause Davis said Two Shot Two Shots and the ball was the signal we got Applause call I think its on RJ Davis John Shys gone back to his huddle Hubert Davis is still having a very animated conversation with the officials so it looks like the common foul on Davis has been upgraded to a hook and hold which means its two shots and the ball maybe we didnt see the full replay they and they saw a different one than we did but I didnt see that here comes Roger a to get real bad here but Im to UPG to a hook RJ Davis and Roger again telling us I didnt see it that way but they they called a hook and hold on RJ Davis so its going to be two shots for filipowski and Duke ball that is a huge call with 43 seconds remaining in Applause regulation this could could potentially be a fivepoint play based upon that Applause ruling and you can hear how the 21000 feel about it here with the dean all right lets focus on the arms I dont think RJ Davis had him but maybe Im seeing it differently than the officials did but they took multiple looks at Music it the left hand oh theres his hand okay there it is the left hand around the forearm of filipowski its not a call obviously especially hes experienced a group of officials CU but filipowski arm is around his at first its really really an interesting situation but at the very end you saw RJ Daviss hand on his arm and then adding injury to insult he took an elbow to the face from his own teammate Trimble but RJ Davis is coming back under the court so thats good news but this this the the door is a jar as it is a jar after after this call here so two in the ball for Duke two free throws and then North Carolinas going to have to guard that threepoint line again because Duke needs points in a hurry one of two 8880 Duke ball with 43 seconds to go what Carolina wants to do is make this ball go to the short side of the floor to the right side the ballside and a turnover and tremble doesnt have to force anything and he gets it to the right guy in Davis and that may signal the end of the opportunities for Duke RJ Davis after taking that shot and getting the hook and hold called on him corm Ryan doing a nice job of reading that play Philip palowski instead of catching it tried to dribble it with one hand his left hand and that puts Carolina at the line so instead of Duke getting a fourpoint or fivepoint play they miss a free throw and turn it over and RJ Davis able to Salt this one away even after a fourpoint first half RJ Davis now has 17 points and hell get a huge Ovation he sits Withers back in the seconds ticking away McCain lays it in for two more 23 three different Blue Devils have 20 or more in this game and theyre still down by Music eight and a timeout taken by Hubert Davis so first meeting of two in the regular season between two top 10 teams have you learned or what have you learned that needs to be said again about both of these teams based on what youve seen tonight both these teams are final four capable and I think Duke is theyve gotten healthy theyve got really good guards theyve got the ability to beat almost anyone but Carolinas defense is legit it is legit and its funny they theyve given up 82 points but still and I agree with you their defensive effort tonight was fantastic and one of the most impressive things throughout the game to me is how North Carolina has taken care of the basketball Its been a a ridiculously low error game for the tar Hills what five turnovers in in the ball game for for UNCC that thats ridiculously Applause Music efficient Trimble to inbound two on Davis trying to keep it away from him Carolina gets it in to Ryan and hell run a few more seconds off the Music clock or MC Ryan a 90 free throw shooter himself thats a thats a luxury at the end of games to have guards that can knock free throws down at that rate a win for Carolina and theyd create a little more distance between themselves and everybody else in the league Virginia won today at Clemson by 16665 dont look now here come the whoos 8 and three a tough loss for Clemson the league in the middle is kind of muddled and jumbled and right now only three projected tournament teams out of the ACC maybe a couple of teams step forward assert themselves beat up on others the rest of the way but right now these two teams one and two in the league as Philip hsky lays it Applause in Davis theyre trying to make him give it up tremble kicks it away ahead to Bott and that is the exclamation point on a Tar Hill win over the Blue Devils here tonight
