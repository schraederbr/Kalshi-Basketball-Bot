so pal and Jackson two highly touted freshman in the lineup for North Carolina and we are underway its Louisville that starts with the basketball the Cardinals team that got a scare over the weekend against Northern Kentucky but found a way to win Easter Kentucky and now Chucky heurn who is made the goto guy throughout the Cesar for the Cardinals 24 and white they go back door and its wide open Noah Waterman opens the scoring rocking the rim Louisville plays with an empty block five out and they can put a lot of pressure on you with their ability to cut and move without the ball thats how they put pre pressure on the rim Debbie you mentioned the darn Hill still without Seth Trimble so Ian Jackson stays in the starting lineup they go inside with Jaylen Washington who answers Jaylen Washington can give them a back to the basket presence the Jackson great transition defense the rejection at The Rim here we are talking about Carolina likes to get in transition fast break points and Louisville under Pat Kelce theyll Run and Gun as well well North Carolina is second in the league in Fast Break points at 16 a game its an emphasis for Pat Kels team transition defense is plan a and one a and one B the other thing for North Carolina is you got to guard the threepoint line against Louisville but 53 of the shots they take are outside the ark and Noah Waterman knocks down the first five points of the game hes playing with an issue with his thumb that he suffered an injury in the Florida State game but hes playing through with that thumb injury looked pretty good shooting that three in the Applause corner The Freshman Powell fading away left it Applause short Louisville not shy they will let it fly theyve come out aggressive just quite couldnt connect on the alleyoop there right down the lane everything but the finish for Ian Jackson and North Carolina puts a lot of pressure on you in the full court with their transition game and their speed in the back court theres an early offensive opportunity for Hadley North Carolina has done nice job protecting the rim twice step back three RJ Davis cant connect hes been a reliable threepoint shooter throughout his career shooting a career low 28 from Beyond The Arc to start this Applause season Edward snakes behind that ball screen Waterman a heat check falls off the Applause mark North Carolina can put a lot of pressure on you up the floor they have great speed in the back court they run the floor hard and wide great pass Chucky Huard and Javon Hadley makes it look easy underneath what louville wants to do is play in a halfcourt game with North Carolina they dont want to let them get up and Applause down and through three minutes its been a great start for the home team Cardinals Chucky heer got caught on a switch and did a really good job of running Jaylen Washington out but it opened up that driving lane for Drake pal Carolina had missed four in a row before the Freshman Powell finally took the lid off the rim heres Terrence Edwards Jr working on Davis finds heurn Chucky heurn through traffic no good Jackson not shy right to the rim for two its a really interesting strategy by Hubert Davis to put Ian Jackson The Freshman who had been picking up Chucky heern in the full court now when the game slows down a little bit kadoo is on him Louisville going inside Javon Hadley called for the shove in the back and weve got a good one here in Louisville just getting started when we come back well tell you about RJ Davis and Mark moment that was fantastic we had a chance to talk to Marcus on our way out of the gym today after shoot around and hes proud of what RJs been able to do but we will mention that it is in five years and Marcus pige had 299 made threes in the fouryear career he had at North Carolina Davis is climbing the alltime points record for Carolina as well just 14 point shy of Armando Bott for second all time some great memories of Marcus page in the back court for Roy William at North Carolina and how nice is it that he can coach the future generation up as well as part of the Hubert davis staff shot clock down to 10 and Jackson for three cant connect and a foul called on the ensuing rebound then Allen Luben Off the Bench and into the game this is an undersized Carolina team and even though Van Allen Luben only stands at 68 he plays is a lot bigger than that and theyll need him to to be that way throughout the rest of the year Well everybodys talked about the lack of a big man for North Carolina right and and what Hubert Davis has done is hes taken one of their strengths which is their speed and quickness in the back court and hes figured out how to put the right Personnel on the floor you still can play through the post you dont have to just play to the post but one of the things for RJ Davis is the space on the floor has changed heres a naked side single coverage Twan game and V Allen Luben does a good job of getting to the free throw line well we just mentioned Armando Bott and you speaking with Hubert Davis and the staff at shoot around today they said look its taken us a little while to play without a guy that every Scouting Report was double the post double the post teams have not done that this season and it affects the way you play offensively well when you get single coverage it changes the space and it has definitely affected RJ Davis his numbers are down a little bit in terms of his percentages and his efficiencies but theyre on the trending are trending the right way now I think a lot of that has to be uh do with Ian Jackson being on the floor as well he he changes the space on the floor for RJ Waterman cant connect that time he has five of the Cardinal seven in the opening five minutes the lob read beautifully knocked down by rain Smith heurn before he took the three which went in offensive foul called for an illegal screen against Hadley Heburn not happy about it CU it negates his Applause threepointer it looked like you had to call something there Music I mean he flipped it and if you were going to Elliot Kau was that a block I mean was that were youre going to call it the other way Ted Valentine calls a travel on the other end ball back to Louisville and what a job Pat Kelsey has done only 13 games into his Louisville tenure they had a very challenging nonconference schedule hes come through it at 8 and5 and now you got Carolina playing here the buzzes back in the building after it escaped for the last couple of Seasons if you can find a way to win this one Louisville basketball would feel very much back well if you know Pat Kelsey you know everything about him is a winner his culture is about winning hes about the process and North Carolina did a really good job guarding that flare screen and not letting rain Smith get a good look at the basket North Carolinas shoot around spent a lot of time on making sure they closed out long on the shooter rain Smith for Louisville next Saturday ACC Network a triple header beginning in Clemson as they take on Florida State North Carolina on the road taken on the wolf pack and then Virginia Tech at Cal is your night cap Chucky heurn knocks him both down hes been a programed stabilizer for Pat Kelce the veteran guard whos all over RJ Davis a lock down Defender its a great matchup right here two of the top guards in the ACC in any way you want to measure Music it thats Zoom action right there RJ Davis accelerates off that so well stolen away rain Smith poked it free the blow by count the bucket and the foul R Smith knew it was a goal T So a threepoint opportunity coming its just a great job by rain Smith in the Gap comes up with the steel one of the favorite numbers I love about rain Smith is his career is 338 threes and 52 tws in his fouryear college basketball career well theyll review the goal but it might be 5 three I think its going to be 53 in North Carolina theyve gotten sloppy here three turnovers in the last minute 21 and as it stands Louisville is cashed in for four points off of those Music turnovers its just a nice job by rain Smith crosses up k Tyson and I definitely think thats a basket that counts and the officials have just confirmed it so rain Smith an opportunity to get a threepoint play the oldfashioned way J for shooter around today both these coaches Pat Kelce and Hubert Davis I mean the detail was incredible they both were working on situational offense especially late game situations late clock situations and I think those are things you have to work on every day especially when you get into conference play because its going to be possession for Applause possession then Allen Luben finds Jackson fires the three and buries it Ian Jackson he is scorching coming off 26 point and 24o performances hes averaged those 25 the last two but 17 points in the last seven hes playing with a lot of comp confidence long rebound kept Alive by heurn heres Edwards Jr denies the screen and Louisville turns it over Drake Powell pull up pop got it backto back buckets by the rookies you know I was talking to Hubert Davis today about the exhibition game against Memphis when it was the first time we really got a chance to see Drake pal and Ian Jackson in the 10 weeks since then they have improved significantly they just are more comfortable learning how to play with Pace learning to play inside the system not trying to do too much and thats the only bright side of not having Seth Trimble available for these last two games it means more minutes for Jackson and Powell in particular the and Allen Luben down the lane denied at The Rim trior got a piece of Applause Music Applause it now these teams are not shy they will let it fly the defense has been excellent how about trayor at The Rim heres so interesting North Carolina had a couple of plays early at The Rim now Louisville protecting inside out and you wouldnt consider either one of these teams to necessarily have a a shop Music blocker though both would be considered undersized in the ACC but they play hard defensively you know sometimes it could be misleading they give up so many points thats just the pace at which they play at well that has a lot to do with that North Carolina plays with one of the fastest Paces in all of colle basketball 147 seconds per possession which is seventh in the nation according to kenpom the Louisville has missed their last four one of their last seven bra Smith trying to change that and another three gets waved off because of a foul before the shot Ted Valentine saying he called the foul before rain Smith started his shooting motion so even though the foul was against Carolina we stay tied at 12 as we step away hands full as well trying to keep these guys healthy miscommunication defensively for North Carolina and Javon Hadley took advantage of it drew the foul but the way Pat Kelce wants to play he needs as many healthy bodies as he can its all about Pace pace and process is what I would say about Coach Kelsey he is animated he is excited he loves what he does he infuses incredible energy and practice into his guys the detail and the Scout is on point I asked him if he watched the ball drop last night he said no said Im early riser like 400 am this is Boundless Energy all of his attention on nor Carolina in a critical conference game right at the start of ACC play its a quad two opportunity for Louisville this would be a quad one for North Carolina kdo spin cycle no good heurn pushing that pace finds Waterman goes Baseline everything but the Finish you know both these teams are getting players back and not crashing the offensive glass thats how much respect each coach in program has for the transition game of the Music other RJ Davis the floater doesnt fall Davis still scoreless about Midway through this first half Louisville a twopoint Edge Chucky heper recognized a mismatch oh you got to shoot that wide open took a little time to line up that three transition three Tyson got it Kade Tyson fires Carolina in front everyone around Chapel Hill is waiting for Cade Tyson to get hot just seems like if he sees the first one go in it could be a big game for him the younger brother of Hunter Tyson who is terrific for Clemson on the Block mismatch and Hadley takes advantage Javon Hadley the immediate answer for Louisville I think Javon Hadley is one of the best hustle guys Pat Kelce has hes a perfect prototype for the way Pat Kelsey likes to play hes got versatility he can invert to the block like we just saw hes coming off a double double in the last game which is his fourth of the Season he can guard one through five brings a lot of Versatility to the Applause lineup first year coach in Kelsey but a lot of first year players he went into that portal got 12 new guys you never know how theyre going to mix and match together it feels like the lineup of you know Hadley and Scott and Waterman playing together theyre 40 as a starting lineup with those three in it Tyson misses that time I like the call from the bench though by Hubert Davis to see if you can get Tyson going and to your point about the chemistry for Lou us Chucky heer knocks down a midrange if you play hard and you play unselfishly youre going to be able to play for both of these Applause coaches heres Jaylen Withers into the game fires a three Off the Mark he played for Louisville 131 games over three seasons this is his first time back in the KFC Young Center sus transferring Smith quick trigger nothing but the bottom of the net for rain Smith rain Smith is so good feeling behind that penetration quieting the crowd Jaylen Washington count it plus the Applause foul this is a great answer by North Carolina watch rain Smith behind the penetration of Hadley you cannot fall asleep on rain Smith you have to know where he is youve got to push the quality of his catch out further and you cant let him see a big Applause Music basket Louis had made three in a row and between that and and the former teammate Withers missing it really got the KFC Yum Center into the game and that is exactly what Carolina needed Jaylen Washington quieting this crowd Applause Music down I think Jaylen Washington has another level of of gear for them as North Carolina goes into their full court press which was the first thing that Pat Kelce worked on in shooter around today was handling the Press offense against that North Carolina d well North Carolinas full court pressure has been outstanding but its usually when theyre down double digits and they have a sense of urgency right there a situational defense and Louisville prepared for that today at shoot around thats a tough time out to have to burn for that reason shot clock down to five Edwards Jr in trouble hoists it up left it short good defense out of the timeout by Carolina kdo step back three way off the mark offensive rebound Applause Washington Powell he cant connect two really good looks on this possession now heres a third opportunity for the tar Applause Music Hills neither one of these teams are excellent threepoint shooter but Louisville just takes a high volume of them Jackson flying to the rim but he misses the Finish Ian Jackson so explosive but hes missed three layups in this first half catch it shoot Reign SM thats what he does Applause best nine points in this first half for rain Smith and its a sixpoint lead for Louisville their largest of the night kdo down the lane gets it to go really patient kdo hes an excellent downhill driver most teams go under ball screen action with him and he showed a lot of patience on that right there waiting for the lane to open up crosscourt pass rain Smith deep three heat check too much on it Jaylen Washington had a handful of offensive foul going the other way he had a handful of the Jersey of anel eBay thats and the team does such a great job of putting it right in the pocket you know so he never has to dip he doesnt have to drop his hips he does his work early he does his work before the ball gets in his hands and hes got excellent footwork but when he can catch and shoot with his range and I mean look at that story right there it tells the story about 85 of his attempts from the floor are outside the threepoint line you followed his head coach pack Kelsey here to Louisville and what a luxury for Kelsey knowing youve got a proven commodity as a shooter Smith right on Q missed it well its really good a really good call by the bench to run him off a stagger and they get him going to his right and hes a lefthanded shooter thats hard to do but hes capable of doing it RJ Davis back into the game has it here its still scoreless hes gone 12 minutes without a bucket yeah I like our that uh Huber Davis tries to get him isolated for an opportunity to get a midrange Applause jumper and a foul on the alleyoop attempt with Scott fly to the Music rim James Scott has 34 baskets and 23 of them are dunks he is a rim Runner lob catcher dropb put putback guy drop off putback guy he does a really good job around the rim and hes got guys that can feed it to him like Chucky heurn whos in discussion with Pat Kelce over on the Louisville sideline as we remind you womens basketball takes over the ACC Network every Thursday begin beginning tomorrow Florida State at Castle Coliseum take it off Virginia Tech and then Stanford at SMU is your night Applause cap Scott comes up empty at the line Carolina looking for somebody to ignite this offense on the road theres that Zoom action where RJ Davis is so good at accelerating off that pinned down into a dribble handoff and he can turn a corner shot clock down to five Tyson rejected from behind Noah waterbit says get that out of Applause here shot clock running down here comes that Zoom its a pin down into a dribble handoff and Terrence Edwards Jr does a great job of chasing behind RJ Davidson making him turn him into a Applause passer heurn lobs it up James Scott we were just talking about it on the flush he runs to the rim he gets early position its a great leave at the front of the rim 5 minutes remaining in this first half Louisville back back up by six he makes it look so easy Chucky heer does such a great job of putting kadoo in jail and it makes Jaylen Washington have to step up and it opens up Scott at The Rim Scott a North Carolina native another one that followed Pat Kelsey from the College of Charleston back doors open Davis gets his first basket of the night Carolina been trying to get RJ Davis going but you know thats one of the things that Pat Kelce wanted to do was force RJ Davis to go back door hoping that wed have some help at The Rim it was just a great cut by RJ Davis good pump fake Edwards Jr right back to Scott whos feasting James Scott backto back Music baskets kdo lines up the Triple too much on it theyre going to keep going under until he makes a few Edwards Jr with a head of steam right to the rim lays it up and in for two and because Louisvilles been able to score theyve been able to get back and load up their defense and this crowd Comes Alive youd love to see it at the KFC Young Center with North Carolina in town Louisville up by Music Applause eight for everyone that plays North Carolina Applause Music now its amazing to see the scene here at the KFC Yum Center we were talking about it just before we went to break but Pat Kelsey in year number one hes brought the Feelgood Factor back to this program well this has always been a knowledgeable fan base are you kidding me the state of Kentucky I mean theyre all over it right and one of the timeouts Mel Brown Jr committed to the Louisville Cardinals today hes here hes on the Jumbotron hes at midcourt you remember when you used to not be able to do any of that stuff RJ Davis exactly what Carolina needed drills a deep Applause three hes the best threepoint shooter in North Carolina history you have to know where he is heres a mismatch kdo and Edwards tell you what Elliot kdo usually does a pretty good job guarding taller Defenders and Edwards dribbles to the corner shot clock down to three Brooks has to heave it and he does Off the Mark for Carolina comes out of the timeout and RJ Davis three now a scoop to the hoop backto back baskets for RJ Davis its a really good Advanced pass by Elliot cadoo and then once RJ Davis saw rain Smith backpedaling he made the right choice the blow by Javon Hatley provides the immediate answer Applause Music DAV is starting to heat Applause up Hubert Davis was trying to get ven alen Luben to clear out of the way so RJ could go one on one with Applause rain Edwards Jr crossover rejected at The Rim Drake Powell flew in its so hard to pump fake and double pump and all that stuff around the rim because North Carolina comes flying from the weak side to make a play you got to go in Music Applause strong they might be under sized in height Carolina but theyre still long with the likes of Ven Allen Luben and Drake Powell he bur into the lane draws contact crafty veteran and Chucky heurn he he knows just the exact spots to get to on the court where he can maneuver and be most effective know Chucky heern was really looking forward to this matchup he told us today like many kids grow up watching North Carolina he was looking forward to sizing him his game up against RJ Davis tomorrow 10 Eastern after our womens basketball double header the nothing but neet crew will have you covered everything you need to know in the world of ACC womens Hoops thats 10 Eastern on acc Applause Music Network what do you want to see here out of North Carolina final 2 minutes of the first half trailing by six I think you want to see if RJs got the hot hand so I think you run something for him right here we scoreless for 12 minutes and now is scored s draws the foul yeah its a good call from the bench by Hubert Davis you try to put him in a ball screen action and let him get downhill hes an excellent free throw shooter as well North Carolina is Relentless in their downhill driving ability and they put a lot of pressure on your defense so its their fullcourt vertical game and transition and then its their ability off the bounce in the quarter Court this is a Tar Hill team that is battled back from large deficits in this season they trailed UCLA by 16 won that game so theyll look at you know a two possession game and say this is nothing well they had five players in double figures against UCLA they only turned it over seven times and their full court pressure changed the game and RJ Davis made plays late including going three for four at the free throw line to put the game away for North Carolina he bur great feed everything but the Finish Scott somehow couldnt lay it in foul called James Scott is always in the paint making himself available look at that he has his hands ready to catch North Carolina has to do a better job of keeping Louisville out of the paint with off the Music bounce Scott now 0 for three from the foul line one of the things that Chucky heern told us today is James Scott has been working on his free throws every night hes in the gym and Chucky has been asking him to be more aggressive they need more out of James Scott so Chucky says he has confidence in him and hes just keeps encouraging him and thats what a leader does Davis has the last nine points for the Tar Heels after a quiet beginning Powell takes it Lefty no good heer goes right at the Freshman Powell after he missed and draws the foul again see its a smart take by Chucky heurn because the Terrence Edwards Jr runs to the Deep corner and takes RJ Davis with him and that opens up the lane and youre not going to help off a threepoint shooter on the strong side so Chucky gets down through the slot in transition this is what Im talking about right here watch Terrence Edwards Jr has RJ Davis pulled away look at the space that opens up its great take off the bounce in transition how fun is it in this first half to see heurn and Davis two veteran guards great match up great matchup continue to go at it theyre not guarding each other on every possession but they are the leaders of this these two programs no doubt about it Jackson hes been getting to the rim just cant quite finish it in this first half Edwards Junior aggressive follows his own Miss kicks out Waterman a three thats no good its like an automatic kick out on an offensive rebound and North Carolina has a two for one opportunity here Jackson sees the lane loses his shoe gets blocked and a whistle underneath Clarence Armstrong picks up the shoe to hand it back to the Freshman Jackson Im sorry but Im never going to understand why you step out of a shoe in in a basketball game you got to lace them up Applause tighter there you go double knot it thats pretty tight you got it tight you tighten them up lay some pull the strings on those things the Jackson coming off those backto back big games careerhigh 26 points against Campbell after 24 against UCLA he is been not shy tonight hes taken eight shots but only made two of them so Hubert Davis substitutes Tyson out for Withers for a defensive possession and Pat Kelce counters with rain Smith for an offensive possession its only 5sec differential in the shot clock and the game clock and Rain Smith leads the car Cardinals with nine points in this first half RJ Davis guarding Smith The Freshman Drake Powell on Chucky heer shes going to try to keep Chucky heer on this side of the floor Drake pal doing a good job not using his hands shot clock down to five Hadley and a foul call Hubert Davis doesnt like it over on that Tar Hill sideline Louisville in the double bonus so theyll get two yeah thats a break for Louisville because they really didnt have anything going with the shot clock down to Applause three now Hubert Davis over in conversation with Ted Valentine and in a game that has all the makings of one thatll come down to the final possession and will could be a point or two you understand why hes giving Valentine an earful now the tar Hills have a use it or lose it timeout here 84 seconds remaining theyre going to get RJ Davis downhill right here heurn all over Davis down to two seconds Davis has to hurry got the shot off but misfired great defense by Chucky heer and Louisville takes a sixpoint lead each side all to rank team so this is a critical game between two teams looking to separate themselves in the ACC Ian Jackson what a start to this second half the explosive freshman hes had no trouble getting to the rim hes had some trouble finishing but not that time RJ Davis picking up Chucky heer and the two veteran guards theyve been so fun to watch and heer gets the better of Davis Applause there kdo hands it off jayen Washington an immediate answer really nice execution and thats something Elliot CAU does so well on their ball screen action he is such a good deliverer of the basketball especially to the big man on the roll heurn followed his air and pass cleans up his own spill Jackson tried to split the double good job to go vertical at The Rim by Louisville the four baskets of the opening 70 seconds of this second half Louisville goes right back inside kick out three Edwards Jr cant connect I know that Hadleys playing the percentages there but the taking the two versus passing it out to Terrence Edwards a threepoint shooter his decision might have been better shooting the two jayen Washington called for an illegal screen thats his first foul basketball Applause heres Noah Waterman started the game strong he had the first five points for Louisville been quiet since heer just backing down the Freshman Chucky heer if you dont come with short choppy steps on the close out and get in a stance Chucky is going to blow right by you its all heurn to start this second half he has Louisville leading by eight and another illegal screen called against Jaylen Washington that was the exact same spot on the court and the junior called for an illegal screen on backtoback Applause Music possessions for the C off heper the L gathering at The Rim James Scott is Applause fouled North Carolina triple switching that action in the middle third of the floor and thats where James Scott is so valuable to Louisville cuz he can stretch their offense to the rim lob catcher Rim Runner offensive putb and a drop off kind of player he doesnt have many post moves and hes not a very good free throw shooter but hes hes working on it every day to become better yeah he entered the game just 48 and hes 0 for five from the line tonight thats the opposite of you Debbie finally Scott gets one to go Elliot kdo the drive draws contact this is where I think Elliot CAU has gotten so much better and according to Hubert Davis cuz we asked him about it today hes just better making decisions that time he rejects the screen in the lane he creates the space himself by using his body when youre a smaller player you learn how to finish at The Rim or get to the free throw line against taller Defenders Davis used the the football analogy as a quarterback sometimes its okay to check it down for a 5yd completion rather than go for the 30 yd bomb and kdo doing a much better job managing the game had a careerhigh 12 assists last time out and right now theyre weaking all ball screen action trying to force it left bra Smith that doesnt drop he led Louisville in scoring in that first half and he is quick to heat up foul called on heurn who was chasing RJ Davis thats his second and this is where North Carolina can absolutely be relentless theyre looking to attack always looking downhill trying to drive into the paint get a piece of the paint he pass it off Drake Powell the Finish but it was all set up by kudos Applause Drive the lob hes always at The Rim James Scott flying to the basket you cant pinch to help and in the middle third you get no help because the shooters in the corners its very well executed Jackson that three rolled around but didnt fall got a good look the Applause Freshman theres a mismatch theyre going to clear it out right here and let Hadley go oneonone right back to Scott theyre just feeding him James Scott what a run by the Cardinals out of the locker room Hubert Davis doesnt want to call a timeout here I think sometimes when you have your offense in front of you you dont need to call a timeout from the bench blin and a foul called me and Jackson went to the rim to try and clean up the spill call the number Oney for Louisville the Chucky heurn has been a program stabilizer Pat Kelce bringing in heurn and you were showing his offensive production which is a career best 15 points per game but what he brings just to a locker room the defensive intensity is a perfect fit for Pat Kelce hes a high IQ guy that can make decisions at a fast rate which Pat Kelce likes to play fast and its not just always offensive decisions its his defensive Rhythm as well he knows when to trap when to try to get a steal he reads the game so well speaking of when to trap coming out of the timeout Ian Jackson at the foul line if the Freshman makes this I think theyre going to go full court pressure I think Louisville will be better prepared for it this time he missed so the tar Hills couldnt set up their trap even if they wanted to and its an an eightpoint lead for Louisville two teams at 8 and five just as ACC plays starting to heat up critical conference game and the Cardinals are rolling ruths the Freshman getting in on it and its an 11point Lis lead a 15 shooter but when you get behind the basketball and have your good footwork you can knock it down nice play by North Carolina coming back to respond quiets the crowd down but temporarily Louisville getting everything they want to start this second half until Ben Allen Luben has something to say about Applause it they go right back to Luben on the offensive end delivering on both ends of the floor the junior V Allen Luben quick strike and that single side coverage single side ball screen Terrence Edwards Jr goes right the kadoo draws the contact and it falls and one opportunity coming for Terrence Edwards Jr and I think Louisville is being more aggressive here in the second half definitely getting to the paint not settling for threes and this is a size Advantage for Terrence Edwards Jr at 66 CAD listed at 61 and the Cardinals shooting seven of 10 in this second half so as good as North Carolina can be on the offensive end they need to find a way to get some Applause stops trailing by nine heres RJ Davis great pass and a block is the call home fans dont like it thats his third you got to look and see if he establishes legal guarding position you can turn to avoid the contact to protect yourself thats not a call the fans in here liked of course not step up screen slipping out of that good pass freshman to freshman Ian Jackson finds a wide open Drake Powell Louisville has to be careful that they dont allow North Carolina to get behind them on those cuts got to keep everybody in Applause front ra Smith driving off the window and in for two with the off hand not usually his game the Australian known for a catch and shoot guy foul called on the floor Music his Music four and that is the fourth foul against Kai Roots so the Freshman has to check out of this game in comes Noah werman I think Hubert Davis has gotten very good production out of the five spot today Bo he is so smooth Ian Jackson nothing but the bottom of the net the fresh knocks it down cuts it to seven heurn left it short maybe too quick when he had a clear out he should have taken Tyson off the bounce Davis transition three too much on it offensive rebound hauled in Davis a second chance at it doesnt drop it was halfway down Applause Waterman off the feed from Scott Noah Waterman somehow gets it to go after Waterman hits the game winner against EKU Pat Kels first thing in the postgame press conference is toughness on Noah Waterman you saw it right there and somehow that falls in Applause this is some elite shot making good defense and everything has had to be earned in this second half especially the last few possessions you feel it getting up and down a little bit Tempo picking up here in the second Applause half for theing Scott Applause Chucky heurn out of this game for Pat Kelce thats a rarity lets see how the Cardinals manage without him Waterman lines up at three no good trior there to clean up the spill for two good job on the weak side both these coaches know where the weak link is defensively and theyre both trying to attack it Ian Jackson pull up and a foul call Louisville cant believe it I would call that a patient whistle like I think Ted Valentine may have let that one go if it went Applause in its a term the officials use there you see the foul Tri he was on the follow Music through Ted Ian Jackson four of five from the foul line Ian Jackson is only going to continue to get better he hasnt even touched the surface of what he could do on the defensive side side of the ball sometimes in rotations you know in the schemes it takes a little longer for freshman but once he learns that side of the ball hes going to be able to have an impact for Hubert Davis on the defensive end and Ian Jackson sends his head coach Hubert Davis a daily text message focused on improving how can I get better and you mentioned the defense hell say thanks for pushing me on defense in particular how can I get better on the defensive end of the floor and that is every single day you got to stay in the moment in the process but you got to see the bigger prize not just for the team but for yourself good pass to the corner Waterman Miss fires and this foul goes against Carolina itll stay with Louisville ball underneath their own hoop when we come back the Cardinals leading by eight Music good off the bouns getting to his spots getting to the rim hes had a pretty good second half here hes had eight of his 15 in the second half and you see what hes done the last two games averaging 25 points in the last two to earn ACC rookie of the week in those backto back wins for North Carolina no doubt about it Ian Jackson has been the Catalyst can he be the Catalyst again in a comeback effort on the road in conference play and Waterman shoved out of bounds by Kate Tyson see thats not a good foul coming off the timeout now you put Noah Waterman to the free throw line for a one and one if anybody catches the ball in that deep corner you definitely dont want to foul him you want to contest the threepoint shooter L the number 93 he shoot and Louisville in the bonus the rest of the way 1141 remaining well and Louisvilles next foul will put North Carolina in the bonus too so we might be shooting a lot of free throws here Waterman misses the front end of a one and one missed Washington on the roll North Carolina is really good in their quick hitters and transition up the floor Applause Jackson feeding inside Washington misses it and Tyson bumps heurn on the ensuing rebound and Louisville will head right back to the foul line thats and thats the fourth foul against Kade Applause Tyson Elliot kdo with four fouls as well for North Carolina so Hubert Davis going to have to manage the bench here with some foul trouble at the line for the cards JY heurn hell shoot the one and one one and one for heurn thats RS out back to back one and ones that Louisville has missed third and now North Carolinas going to go down and shoot a one and one because of a foul on the rebound Louisville just 11 of 21 from the foul line tonight thatll keep Pat Kelce up he already doesnt sleep as it Music Laughter is Carolinas fared better at the foul line 10 of 13 and V Allen Luben knocks down the front Applause end this is a possession for possession and everything we thought it would be weve seen Pace weve seen a change in Rhythm by both teams I think the difference right here is going to be when North Carolina decides to put the full court pressure on if they do and what Louisville does to attack it on the backside theres a lot of ways you can change the rhythm of the game Jay it doesnt have to just be changing your defense it could be a substitution on offense it could be a time out theres a lot of ways to change the Rhythm good ball movement Edwards so wide open and three cant hit Applause it 53 of the shots that Louisville takes or threes but they are less than 30 as a team Davis pull up Pop Goes begging and trior lost it Ted Valentine says its going to be Carolina Ball but I I I thought that it was swiped away out of tris hands by with yeah clearly Withers and the off come together and overturn the call as they should Jaylen witherss the former Cardinal got a hand in Music there heurn splits the double team rain Smith step back three no good Pat Kelce can get rain Smith a three almost every possession they go Spain and Rain Smith slips out of it to get a wide open Applause look so well executed except for Music finish at the line for the guards number 25 he will shoot the one and so now Kadir trior with a one and one Louisville has fallen into a twominute scoring drought and it continues that is three straight one and ones where Louisville is missing to the front end leaving the door wide open for North Carolina in a twopossession game 10 minutes Applause remaining now this is Ian Jackson oneonone he goes middle third he doesnt need any help and Rain Smith stands him up trior misses the layup nothing will fall for the Cardinals right now theyve missed five in a row RJ Davis contact count it plus the foul RJ Applause Davis very seldom are you going to get the charge and what the officials do is they look at that last plant foot if youre not set by the time the last plant foot is set theyre going to call it a block at the line number four there is Applause and you know what it has really removed a lot of collisions around the rim it has helped the game Davis makes it a onep possession game and Hubert Davis is still not gone to that full court pressure Pat Kelce takes a timeout well take one as well all the makings of a fun finish coming in Louisville guarding ball Applause Music screens and Louisville is struggled to shoot the three they are four of 22 from the floor but they do have the lead they usually like rain Smith coming out of timeouts shot clock down to 10 heres Javon Hadley spins past Withers tried to find Smith in the corner knocked away RJ Davis read that hammer screen action on the backside perfectly to get North Carolina the steal and the layup first turnover Louisville has committed since the 1312 Mark of the first quarter theyve held on to the ball so well and North Carolina forces the turnover there and makes them pay on the other end its the drift pass off the hammer screen action on the backside and RJ Davis just sniffs it out and makes a huge defensive play 9 minutes remaining Louisville desperate for a basket and a foul called Maybe Chucky heer could deliver from the foul line and while the team is 11 for 22 from the free throw line Chucky is five for seven Chucky 11 of 22 on the night one of six in this second half and heer makes that one much needed next Saturday triple header ACC Network mens basketball Clemson take it on Florida State then North Carolina and its state in Raleigh and finally Virginia Tech taking on Cal ACC play is here the rest of the way nonconference is over its going to be like this every night in the league weve got a good one in Louisville the Cardinals clinging to a threepoint lead the flare screen forces the switch RJ Davis has got James Scott on him mismatch Jackson lines up the three and buries it Ian Jackson ties it at 61 thats your AllAmerican playmaker for you RJ Davis what a pass he just draws Chucky he into the Gap just enough to find the open Ian Music Jackson Louisville desperate for an answer North Carolina has an erased an 11point deficit Edwards Jr that rims out no good Davis pull up pop no good oh this is going up and in Rain Smith hell make you pay from three North Carolina made a mistake in transition and Rain Smith made him pay Davis splits the double great pass Withers throws it down again against his former team he trying to take over and does back and forth we go in Louisville RJs made two great passes the last couple of trips this time he turns it over stolen away Edwards Jr fouled and these teams can catch their breath cuz the tempo has upped look at this dime backside cut by weathers Chucky attacks on the other end we got a one possession Music game would make it three oh you can make it three yeah Im making it three well this program had become a shell of itself at Pat Kelce just 13 games into his first season has this building back feeling like this the biggest rebuilding project in all of college basketball and his team will be in the double bonus the rest of the way North Carolina dealing with foul trouble Hubert Davis will have to get creative youve got Powell Tyson and Kau with four fouls and Jackson with three now this is where you miss Seth Trimble for sure who is not available for the second game in a row besides being another downhill driver and a threepoint threat to help space the floor hes an excellent Defender RJ Davis off to Powell shot clock down to eight heres Drake Powell pull up pop and it rims out no good got Applause numbers Terrence Edwards Jr finds Hadley handoff rain Smith a three no Applause good the Jackson pushing the tempo like theyve done all night drawing the foul went right into rain Music Smith on the attack right here rain Smith backpedaling he actually got a piece of the ball there you see him right there he got his got him on the left elbow Applause before Jackson now with 19 points and this freshman is so impressive isnt he Ian Jackson he has been a handful for Pat Kelsey of this Louisville team tonight he has improved in the 10 weeks and you got to give credit to the staff at North Carolina for his Improvement in Pace of play and understanding the game a little bit better at this level takes some time for freshman even as skilled and talented as he is Heber going right at RJ Davis gets the contact but it rims out does not drop heurn will get two at the line Chucky heurn so good at picking his spots right the first half we didnt see him playing aggressively like this at all he was more of a facilitator and then here in the second half he is looking to call his own number and to score I think its the unselfish Nature by which he plays in the first half mhm and then the switch that changes when it becomes winning time well he established himself at Wisconsin as a lock down Defender now hes turning into a big shot Taker and a big shot maker at Louisville they go Iverson over the top they slip out of it then they go stagger for Jackson and Chucky urn is right there all over the Freshman Drake Powell down the lane and he draws contact and that is the fourth foul against rain Smith s Drake howwell to the line for two I think you got to start going offense defense with rain Smith Applause now you need him on the floor for offensive possessions you see Smith looking over at Pat Kelce in the Louisville bench and he does come out of the game Applause Louisville dealing with some foul trouble of their own both Pat Kelce and Hubert Davis will have to get creative offense defense potentially in the final 5 minutes and 30 seconds Powell knocks them both down four point game heurn walks it up 19 points to lead Louisville and score Bing hes been calling his own number down the Applause stretch shock lock down to seven heurn in attack mode ripped away up ahead Ian Jackson and one The Freshman Ian Jackson he is so explosive a lot of contact right there the tip and deflection Ian Jackson steps around and over Terrence Edwards Jr what a play WoW and now Jackson has his third straight 20 plus game up to 22 points hes just getting going he has been the Catalyst of this North Carolina comeback tar Hills trailed by as many as 11 theyve cut it to one with under five minutes remaining lobed inside Hadley in trouble stolen away Davis great dig by RJ Davis another defensive play here while he may not be scoring hes doing other things to impact North Carolinas ability to Music win lost the handle there who touched it last Applause Music the officials still discussing this and Ted Valentine says its Louisville ball weve seen RJ Davis make a couple of drop down dimes for buckets weve seen them him play really good defense and make a couple of plays on this end of the floor for North Carolina thats what you do when your shots not falling Applause Music heurn fouled as he split the double team the Freshman Drake Powell reached in and that is his fifth foul so Drake Powell has fouled out of this game for the final 4 minutes and 17 Applause Music seconds this is all a Carolina team where too many guys are playing out of position Huber Davis has been shuffling so many players out of their natural spot and with the foul trouble that will continue and Louisville misses another free Applause throw that is becoming the story seven of 14 in this second half 17 of 30 on the night theyve left 13 points at the foul line plus the one and ones clear out right here for RJ under four minutes of play shot clock under 10 the reigning ACC Player of the Year consensus allam passes off rejected to the rim shot clock down to one and Ted Valentine says shot clock violation wave off the basket so Louisville flings to this onepoint lead 346 to play you dont want to miss this finish at Louisville Withers who played at Louisville for three seasons scored 882 points it is 131 games for the cards now trying to win it for North Carolina so rign Smith in for an offensive Applause possession and Elliot Kau back into the game the sophomore playing with four fouls Id look to attack him right here going downhill hes guarding Chucky heurn whos been the goto guy down the stretch for Louisville heres Terrence Edwards Jr shot clock down to four trying to spin his way free in the lane Edwards Jr left it short offensive rebound keeps it alive for the Cardinals look how spaced out the floor is the middle of the lane wide open 3 minutes of play shot clock at five heurn fouled shooting three then Allen Luben stepped out and fouled Music heurn the line for the Cs jecky heer hell shoot GRE the shot clock is running down its a late clock its a long contested three cant commit that foul heurn makes the first free throw shooting has been a Bugaboo for the Cardinals tonight 18 of 31 after that make he burs got the first two still one more to come and that puts him over 20 points tonight third 20po game this season ninth of his career Pat Kelce and his staff are 100 engaged over there hes got an offensive coordinator a defensive Music coordinator he does think the analytics but he also has great Instinct the crowd on its feet trying to close out a win against North Carolina Luben picks up his dribble 10 seconds on the shot clock goes up with it great defense by Louisville well the crowd had a lot to do with that Id say took the communication away from North Carolina its so loud in here an awesome atmosphere in college basketball that has returned after a couple of seasons in the basement can they close out this win here at home Smith a three got it and a foul on the other end of the floor Hubert Davis took a timeout before the foul was called gives us an opportunity to look at this rain Smith three he delivers again watch this W Noah Waterman screen he totally takes RJ Davis out R Smith drills it Music b f r Applause b oh now this was a onepoint game Louisville has gone on a 6 nothing run over the last 53 seconds Carolina in a 3minute scoring drought and Hubert Davis was awarded that timeout so the contact that was underneath the hoop disregarded itll be tar Hills basketball trailing by seven well this would be a signature win for Louisville it would be a quad two right now for the Cardinals its a quad one opportunity for North Carolina both need a highlevel win as we mentioned before combine 10 losses between these two programs all to rank teams both teams have been in these situations these late game situations where you cannot have any game slippage your details have to be perfect in executing to be able to finish this one off this home crowd trying to help Louisville get to the Finish Line Jackson through the door screens and Chucky was right on his hip thats a turnover over back so Vin Allen Luen makes an error on the defensive end and fouling heurn and then throws it away here off the timeout Applause Music execution no slippage look for rain Smith on this play to get it back a costly sequence for Carolina under two minutes remaining Louisvilles lead is to seven and a whistle right as Chucky heor crossed half court I think hes looking at the shot clock that should have been a full 30 on the shot clock the shot clock is at 14 I think the shot clock should have been set because that was a change of possession on the turnover correct its a good catch by Teddy Applause Valentine they might have to use a stopwatch on this Applause well five minutes 20 on the shot clock two minutes on the game clock your 5 seconds so five went off so 25 should be on the shot clock good math there right Jay I count on you in the math department dont count on me for that as I say minutes instead of seconds I am no help Louisville getting a big help from this home atmosphere this is a Cardinals team that I think look had some optimism under a new head coach but he has beaten expectations for sure in these opening 13 games and a win against Carolina to improve to two one in ACC play would really really bring this program back where it belongs and he is active over on that sidelines nobody coaches Like Pat Kelsey he is one of one now Im looking forward to um a story coming up that were going to do on him putting a GPS on him in practice nobody moves around and scout team Like Pat Kelce yeah if you think this intensity is saved for game day youre wrong he he might be even more of a Madman during practice right so the clock doesnt change its still at 4 Applause it is I I think it should have been reset to 30 instead its under Music 10 Edwards Jr shot clock down to three driving on Jackson leaves it short offensive rebound keeps it with Louisville kidos got four hat bur heads It Off J Scott hammers it Music Applause home swatted by Scott hes doing everything right now and kadoo has to commit that foul thats his fifth what a block by Scott and he keeps it in bounds as his person what a drop off scott again rattles the rim all game James Scott from behind keeps it in play Scott the North Carolina native with two huge plays one on each end as poorly as Louisville has been at the free throw line their ability to rebound get stops and be positive in the turnover margin have helped them finish this game 10 offensive rebounds for Louisville youre exactly right Debbie Hubert Davis I said your best defense is what he goes when we get a rebound and close the possession and that has hurt them tonight this game was tied at 61 and since then Louisville has taken command an 18 to8 run in a 10point Applause lead time not on the Tar Hill Side start looking for a three one Davis Tangled Up forces it up empty possession that is a lock down defensive effort every everyone one pass away thats going to go look good on film tomorrow heurn fouled again shoved into the stands what a performance by Chucky heer and this Louisville team tonight you cant say enough good things about the way the Cardinals played and particularly impressed by their second half effort Debbie when theep prepar preparation meets the process in a signature opportunity not only a signature win for Pat Kelce but this is a huge boost for Louisville who Joe lonardi right now is not counting in his NCAA tournament bracket he should we have to take a look at him a hard look they dont have a bad loss all five losses to rank teams and the win over West Virginia looks better because West Virginia went into Allen Fieldhouse and beat Kansas they throttled Indiana and theyre going to have a double digit win against North Carolina if they can see this Applause out heurn with 19 points in the second half he took over down the stretch and North Carolina did not have an answer they need a three the Jackson instead fouled and will shoot two and outside of Ian Jackson Who provided 22 points tonight and has two chances to add to that here North Carolina just lacked something on the offensive end well they miss Seth trible thats for sure because thats another 15point scorer on the floor whos also one of the top Defenders on the Music perimeter their foul trouble was an issue it put Louisville in the bonus early Louisville doesnt have to take a shot here the Cardinals went on that 12 nothing run Edwards fouled hard going to the rim Pat Kelsey immediately looks at Hubert says my fault I didnt I was trying not to take a shot but the lane opened up hes apologizing to Hubert Davis Applause and a technical foul was just assess to North Applause Carolina it was Clarence Armstrong who came in to break up the teams coming together and he was the one who issued the tech Applause Music as both teams went to their benches you see heurn and Withers getting into it there just got to walk away something that Jaylen Withers said cuz he is called for the technical now a homecoming of sorts for J wethers his first time back in this Arena that he played in for 3 years and has not gone to plan for Applause him Debbie this game was 7069 Louisville we thought itd be a one possession game the whole way but Louisville stepped on the gas in the final 3 minutes they have outscored the tar Hills 13 to one wow in winning time which is what Pat Kelce has talked about as I mentioned process its a huge win anytime you take down North Applause Carolina now the program that was down in the basement of college basketball is back where they belong a statement Win Louisville knocks off North Carolina 8370 Applause Music
