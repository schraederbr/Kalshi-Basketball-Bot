the ball better I think hes found his spots you know where he can kind of take over he was outstanding in that Florida State game which was a loss but he really he really put this team on his back Music for the top guys for Jacksonville in this game Kevin Nolan the senior from Alabama yeah its all conference player last year and that Atlantic Sun hes their team goes as he goes man its a team thats had a lot of injuries guys in and out of the lineup he has been so solid for them all right Notre Dames been so tough here at home theyre 213 over the last couple of years trying to break that losing streak here tonight in this one spirited shoot around in which coach Bray was urging his players to move the ball in the offensive end get some more touches early in this one missed three that time by Starland starting five for Jacksonville tonight Davis Nolan and osifo have started every game for the Dolphins this year no one leading the team and scoring with over 14 points a game on the miss that time Applause and Stalins pass is intercepted you know Notre Dame starting in a man they theyre trying to search for something defensively they started their first 13 possessions in 23 Zone against Florida State 23 the most in that game they have all season ing an early turnover by Notre Dame one of the best in the country at not doing that trying to get out and run both these tempos are in the 300s nationally in terms of of their Temple they are both very deliberate theyre going to take a lot of that shot clock offensively well this is interesting the found Lozano sifo and he goes right out immediately and Coach Jordan Mitzi has brought in Omar Payne Off the Bench as youll get the starting five for Notre Dame same starting five all 13 games so far this season moshewski is the leading scorer this year right now averaging over 15 points a game for the Irish and Notre Dames got to get Dane Goodwin going uh Miss there hes two of 12 from the field and their last two its been a real tough December for Dane Goodwin but again bad passes here early Nolan Nolan to go to with that one Starling gets it back for Cormac Ryan words for three can almost kind of tell here early at the pace that weve got for both teams in this game Music Applause two minutes Gone By Davis Payne has hand on it for the moment got knocked out by Notre Dame and stays with Jacksonville well the strength of Jacksonville and Jordan Mincey was telling this today I mean obviously is on the defensive side all their numbers point to that I think Jordan Minskys done a nice job you know certainly last season in the early going this year of coaching defense as Payne knocks down that shot there but they dont want their offense to hurt their defense they want to be able to control possessions and its really what theyve done for the bulk of this season its a good point 13th in the country scoring defense give it up just under 59 points a game counted with the foul whos on the board s 25 seconds in and finally their first basket hey liszewskys taking his game to another level he has played very well its been a real strength and an anchor for this Notre Dame team they dont post them a lot you know last year playing through the post a ton you know through Paul Atkinson they just havent done it as much hes not that kind of a player theyve tried to post Dean Goodwin a little bit just trying to find that ability to play through the block theres a real strength for them last season yeah he was the fourth leading scorer for the Irish last year now the leading scorer on this years team hes 41 of 47 from the freethrow line shooting over 87 percent of converts on the threepoint play now a nice drive to the hall pain in the offensive remount off the Cook miss and Payne puts it back up and down cook is banged up right shoulder underneath the basket for Jacksonville or check a cook excuse me Music um and somehow JJ Starling ended up on Omar Payne in pain just said hey little man this is mine Music cook goes out four to three Jacksonville early going here three minutes gone by first after Starlin Applause words to the corner Cormac Ryan for three thats off rebounded by pain please no one on a step back three count it what a shot their team goes as he goes like we said at the top an allconference player last year hes 23 years old just a real high IQ hes playing a lot of basketball and a takeaway Jacksonville Dylan ohern has it up the court quickly for Powell and he stepped on the sideline and Im back to Nolan for a moment you and I talked to him before the game tonight and uh here it is again uh you had talked about it you said hey what are you working on he said patience and decision making back three on that one worse inside Goodwin and theres that post up you know for Goodwin its nice to get him a layup and a really nice job carving out his space drove the defender well out of the lane yourself with a very nice angle and heres that 23 Zone OHearn for three and rebound starling Applause Music good movement here by the iris starlins got it chesky shot clock is down to five for three and Goodwin fighting for it saves it for coming out and right towards to see a fantastic save and then a nice job by words you know the defense a little unsettled everybodys staring at the had to say even words just went downhill that worked out for him heres ohern inside back to Powell pulls up air ball and Payne knocks it out of bounds Notre Dame ball when we come back save and finish on one end and how about this step back tevion Nolan little dance step give me three Chris in a row that you know he did not go home for Christmas they spent the time here and yeah he says he feels like its very beneficial yeah he and I uh would share a different opinion on that uh no its it is its tough man I mean I you know he had a very positive attitude about it and its kind of something that Mike Bray has done they played you know right after Christmas last year had to go on the road this one at home but um you know but Mike Bray does it up you know like he was saying brings them over to the house and does the whole thing and you can kind of keep a rhythm you know you keep a rhythm as a team and this is a team that certainly needs to figure itself out on both ends of the floor and Cormac Rhymes hes got the ball right now hes so dialed in right you know to him he was like yeah we need two days to prepare for a game practices thats a good thing like hes a basketball guy I mean he just wants to go at it day in and day out Powell backing his way in for Jacksonville nice play for Jossie Powell you know that play typifies a short Notre Dame rotation they stay out of foul trouble and you have to but its one of the reasons their interior defense has been kind of soft I mean that just you know pal just backs that in there Ryan misses on the three and its rebounded by Nolan Applause for pain that stretch of Syracuse Marquette Georgia all losses for Notre Dame theyre outscored by 62 points in the paint they dont have you know that that interior rim protector type of guy and they just havent been able to play or havent been as physical on the perimeter on drives and part of it is again trying to stay out of foul trouble Goodwin to the hole and he got rejected inside part of that was pain there in the interior for Jacksonville on the other end and then words gets a block on Jordan Davis and now a three ball for Nolan rebounded by words oh no Starling tough shot stays with it and he gets it back out good one for three not falling the afternoon oh for seven Chris on three pointers here thus far Applause Music Applause traveling violation got a womens basketball doubleheader coming up for you on Thursday for 5 Notre Dame on the womens side and Coral Gables to take on Miami a six Eastern thats gonna be followed up by Duke and number six NC State at eight oclock both games right here on the ACC network and on the ESPN app coming up on Thursday Notre Dame a twopoint loss to Maryland away from being undefeated got a big time Road win at Virginia Tech to open League Play Music the job Neo live hes done Applause Music theres words up top for cormack Ryan and the kick out Marcus Hammond for three we got Nolan Applause overall the Irish have missed their last seven shots Jacksonville not in a hurry right slow and steady here on the offensive end no I mean we said that at the top I mean they they play at one of the slowest temples in the country and against the Zone theyre going to be even slower Chris kind of bearing out and true to form so far on this first half here yeah defense is how Jordan mintzies wanted to build his program you know they they err on the side of aggressive in their Closeouts with their ball pressure in ball screens you know its interesting Jordan Mintz hes saying to his team today our Closeouts tonight have to be elite Notre Dame a team that shoots a lot of Threes so they have certainly done that in the early going here and uh and Jacksonville doing a nice job closing out no one for three and here come the Irish were oh for eight themselves some threepoint range Jacksonville one for four here in the early going Applause about a three minute and 45 second scoring drought so far here for Notre Dame as a trail by four then Alan lumen in for the first time tonight number two Applause Music starling he checked it he won a goaltending not there nice play by osayo sifo in the block for Jacksonville and a wide open three and OHearn drains it Music I mean you get if you cant guard the ball youre going to end up in a closeout drill and its just a Baseline Drive breaks down the defense Jacksonville is on a 70 run here Lubin dumps him inside lachesky and he scores it Music Applause yeah they think too about Jacksonville is they are really unselfish team I mean they average 16 assists a game and part of it is you got a lot of secure guys its an old team they rely on one another Music good movement here for them on the offensive end Nolan works it in and sifo was fighting forward for the Dolphins But Here Comes cormack Ryan Music back inside then Allen Lubin Music already halfway through this first half Ryan tried to force it inside and its intercepted another really good defensive possession plugging gaps not allowing penetration and then covering down on that that pass attempt Jossy Powell for three thats not their rebound Hammond Applause Hammond pulls up got the roll its a guy they need to get going you know LED Niagara in scoring last year heard is at MCL before the start of the season and he just hasnt really gotten comfortable but but hes another hes a veteran guy that can help them yeah Coach Wright trying to work him into the max only played 12 minutes in the last game he missed the first seven games of the Season as you said Chris with that MCL sprain you need some support from off the bats nice block inside as Davis went in then Alan Lubin got it out to Starland Hammonds calling for it again Cormac Ryan for three and rebounded by Jordan Davis another name oh for nine from threepoint range foreign and they make you work on defense you get frustrated from some of the offense right Chris not scoring and then youre gonna go back again play defense for about 25 seconds Music Steel and thats intercepted for Matt Ryan he was looking for the streaking Dylan oherne and its Hamlin that takes advantage of it for another day Applause and turnover is not something that either of these teams can afford particularly with how low possession this game is going to be crowd trying to get into it a little bit here its a quick little six nothing run now by the Irish Music and pulling up with a floater Davis all right Music Applause and that stops a three plus minute scoring draft for Jacksonville as they lead by three Applause Hammond fouled Counting Applause gotta get Marcus Hammond going if youre Mike gray and Notre Dame is dynamic when he gets it into that left hand nice job refusing that ball screen coming back to that strong left hand with a little kiss Ill buy one here over another game and theyve been doing this a lot throughout the season with a host of injuries guys in and out of the lineup theyve had a bunch of guys missing some time and this guy Mike Marsh is missed his third straight game here how much of a factor is that tonight for the Dolphins first the sex ten Junior out of the lineup well hes 240 pounds I mean its its a big deal uh you know and I think part of Jordan mincy its like we start conference play this week do we you know we give them another day to rest so I think that was the calculation but you know he certainly would have fitted in this game against the Notre Dame that you know is a little bit light up front in terms of its interior yeah there was just some discussion he wanted to go he wanted to play but they want to give a little bit more rest that shoulder injury he suffered in the UNCW game four games to go heres Nolan for three and its out of bounds to Notre Dame and the other thing too Mike is that Atlantic Sun is going to be competitive it is a deep lead I mean FGCU already beat USC earlier in the year Liberty was picked to win that League North Alabama just beat Ole Miss I think they were picked second to last in the a song so its a deep League well this team went to the title game last year against Bellarmine and heres Goodwin for three thats no good rebound by Nolan it was an awesome job done by Jordan Mincey in his first season he went to the title game for the first time since 2009 were in number two seed they were picked 10th out of 12 to start the year shows the job that coach and his staff did as they turn it over as pain was out of bounds that their first undefeated season at home 15 150 7273 21 wins last year Music trying to continue to follow it up this season as well they lead here by one tip ball starlings got it for three in the lead and Notre Dame still over from the threepoint line in this first half thus far oh for 11 oh theyve had good looks you know that one there was tough off of the dribble but theyve had good looks theyve got to get Dane Woody Goodwin going you know he came into this game two of 12 in their last two hes now 105 in this game I mean its been a real struggle for Dan Goodwin well I grew to 100 I mean he played 37 minutes in the last game only had two points two points three boards Music and all but three minutes of action Nolan Wild One Payne Zips it but right to Starling for another name Applause good job by Jacksonville getting back for three said you agree with me a hundred percent Ill take 90 maybe 85 I mean you dont have to agree the whole hundred all right thats right thats a good point nothings really 100 right it come on Music missing out the jumper that was Deans sire Ds another offensive rebound here for the Dolphins and thats going the other way moving screen on pain its gonna be a second Music now these two rotating big Spain going to the bench and then Ohio sifo coming in both played at Florida for Mike White they were recruited by Jordan mincy who was an assistant for Mike White there so the connection when Jordan Mincey had to start hitting that transfer portal that connection was there theres Goodwin and he hits Notre Dames first three of the night its your point maybe thatll get him going Music Irish by two now with 4 40 to play in the first half Music no offensive foul and now hes got two so the two big guys as you were talking about Payne and ocivo each have two personals and a really good take by Nate lesevski you know hes kind of on that left side of osifo but when osifo leans in go ahead no sorry continue heres Hammond who hits a three Applause China Jacksonville Music Applause back in Notre Dame here its 2116 now the Irish in front and they force eight turnovers a game thats it not a great Mark in the country of course but tonight already eight so far for Jacksonville and its breathed a little life in the Notre Dames offense and and you know particularly in a game its like we said its gonna be very low possession eight turnovers and a half but still four minutes to go is is not sustainable if youre Jacksonville foreign Music Music gets it for Hammond Music wurtz five to shoot starling offensive you know when Notre Dames offense bogs down there ends up being a lot of standing and more dribbling than were used to from Notre Dame teams this is not as good a passing team as that Notre Dame team was last season no they ran their offense last year a little bit harder a little bit sharper the ball moved better and you could play through the post with Paul Atkinson you had a pro in Blake Wesley and I thought princess hubs toughness on both ends of the floor you know we talked a lot about who stayed for Notre Dame those three guys losing those three guys I think theyve spent the first part of this year trying to find those replacements Davis knocks down a jumper for Jacksonville well and you and I saw it during shoot around today we were trying to work on moving the ball the offensive end and getting some more touches Hammond Music yeah and I think Mike Grays trying to get some movement with that you know hes got some continuity they run that ball screen continuity hes hes got some open stuff that hes tried to run but it a lot of times it boils down to like that last possession you move the ball couple reversals and then hey Im open why dont I Jack a three Nolan misses just kind of see both teams are trading to get back on the defensive end Goodwin stops Music coming up on two minutes left in this first half twopoint Irish advantage Music Carmack Ryan rebound by Powell Music both teams in the low of 30 shooting 32 percent for Jacksonville and pretty much the same thing the other day in 321 percent in this first half Music now four to shoot for the Dolphins Davis got it off in time but an airball violation I mean you gotta hit him cifo hes open twice he was open on the roll and then he was open on the Block youll be doing this game Chris on Friday North Carolina Pittsburgh what do you think well I think Pittsburghs been a real interesting story in the early part of this season I mean they could really shoot the three and then of course Carolina off of two really good wins you know pit in Chapel Hill last year was kind of the low point for the Tar Heels so itll be an interesting game I like the noon starts Mike I like the best starts so United that uh Pittsburgh win at Syracuse last week as a sifo misses they held on they were up by 20 in that game Applause Museum yeah you need the new starts these days with the flight travels and issues well Im not gonna have options Im not flying Southwest yeah please dont do that right now good one scooping Runner not there as he crashes into the station the time being for Jacksonville and OHearn trying to take advantage of it misses on the three Music dont be late arriving to the Joyce Center for this game or you would have missed much of this first half because were flying through it here 216 seconds remaining Irish by two will be back in 30 seconds foreign Music twopoint lead for the Irish year Music 216 seconds to go youre talking about the pace I started checking flights during the break could I get out of here tonight at the rate this one is flying by all right you get a direct back to Charlotte did the patrons pay a full ticket for this game over in an hour and 20 minutes five seconds left Cormac Ryan on the kick Machesky for three not there thats how the first halfs going to end up thats right 2119 low possession Mike sell it that way low possession Notre Dame hey trying to break out of a threegame losing skin theyre up by two at the break half leading scorers if youre Mike gray oh for 10 in that first half they made four of five over a three minute and 27 second stretch but then outside of that theyre five for 26 in this Jacksonville conversely as they start here with the ball in the second half is five for ten early and then they hit three of their last 17 thats going to be an offensive yeah twice now hes been called for charges where look theres driving strong driving irresponsibly and I think Ill tickler I mean its just foolish and this happened to him early because he picked up an early foul and went right out of the game like less than a minute in and then now here in the second half he picks up a foul hes got three he goes right to the bench thats osayo sifo whos out now for Jacksonville Music good one back to Ryan for three still cant get into the scoring column Music Applause s now its Omar Payne battling got the hook no you wonder where the offense for Jacksonville with Kevin Nolan their leading scorer struggling where its going to come from are by Payne would catch on the Block for him I mean Paynes saying Im shooting well Im four for four from the field eight points heres Starling and he and hes down to three Music Davis its two right back for Jacksonville one point game Music George Davis in his sixth College season its 24 years old started at Dayton then ended up in Middle Tennessee Ryan again in and out on the three ball its been over seven night but you know hes capable as we all know of getting hot scoring in bunches just not having his way so far in this game here heres starling foreign Music Music words Applause fights for it and its recovered by Jordan Davis for the Dolphins Stripped Away by Goodwin to drive that time by Powell Music Starling kind of knocks away Davis feed to The Cutting Powell for two and Jacksonvilles back in front yeah I think for both these teams turnovers are Kryptonite because the defense in the half court has been fine against two off at offenses that are struggling those giveaways are leading the runouts come on ski hands off Applause Music gets it back shot clock down to five once again Music and out on the three so Music one seems to be entirely interested in trying to get some offensive rebounds in this game Music trade him right back to the defensive end foreign Music Applause overs have been the story they really have just you know driving into traffic active hints by Jacksonville and then Josie Powell in the open floor moshevski kind of jogging back there we were kind of talking about this with me earlier its like games even before and after the Christmas break right its tough it can go either way right yeah its hard to Applause yeah I think Goodwin its good to see a couple go in for him he had such a really good start to last year its just been a struggle particularly this month of December for him much better outing here tonight though so far eight points three of nine shooting oh nice drive here from Dylan ohurn for Jacksonville foreign s tonight were tied at 27 Music almost five minutes gone by already in the second half good win three ball hammock Music of course tonight hes got 12 points thats his second three of the night Applause Music his Notre Dame threes you know nice drive there by Goodwin good pitch out to Hammond who stepped in with confidence Applause Nolan I dont know nice job getting to the middle of that song Notre Dame again falling back into that 23 Zone you got the freshman then Alan Lubin in the middle there just a little late on that contest Applause Jacksonvilles five of seven here in the second half run inside then Allen a little bit hes blocked in the interior by Kane and now we got a big foul here called and Nolan got hit hard in the face by lashesky still down trying to recover from that shot five and a half gone by in the second half Irish by one well be back here Chris just took a huge shot from lacheski and then he landed kind of on that left wrist yeah and embrace himself then went over there and got it taped up we go can really score had just hit a bucket too against that 23 Zone coming off a game against ulam he had 19 points eight boards and six assists fantastic in their win over ULM before the break yeah I mean you see the tough shooting night tonight but hes got eight rebounds got a couple assists again like you were saying you know he does it in other areas 38 shooting for Jacksonville 30 for Notre Dame knowing that tries to go up top or hey theres gonna be a foul pain is fouled underneath its going against Marcus Hammond for Notre Dame his first only the second team foul in this half they only had two fouls in the whole first half come on Music into a roadblock Applause you know it was a nice early stand by Cormac Ryan on Nolan and then you know Jossy Powell from about 35 feet down just a a drive finish gotta be better on the ball you gotta have better help behind Jacksonville goes back in front Lubin and thats in and out Music three ball no one count it Applause Music inspired here after getting hit in the face hurt his left wrist big threepointer Jacksonvilles made their last four they lead it 3430 Hammond really the only one with a hot hand tonight he really is Music Applause he can score you know as we said LED Niagara last year in scoring they had high hopes for him coming into this season check away Hammond for Ryan fouled count the basket that gets Cormac Ryan into the scoring column another name back in front chance for the threepoint play and another turnover leading to that run out Music said you know maybe this gets Cormac Ryan going he has been superb in the month of December averaging 16 points a game sent from three hes as sharp as any player in this league you could talk to hes 24 years old hes hes in business school here at Notre Dame decided to come back for another year what a delightful guy to talk to you know really intelligent thoughtful considers you know questions you ask him a big fan of Cormac Ryan yeah we had a nice conversation with him earlier before this game tonight you know hes not going to be phased a big bucket there to put the Irish in front now its Nola throwing it down tiger well they got it they tried to get the lob out of the timeout and Notre Dame ended up fouling pain on it good execution there he is five for five in this game plays like that No Doubt six boards as well for pain heres Ryan for three see there you go Applause Music I believe the mathematicians call it a correction to the meme it was bound to happen for Cormac Ryan and its again as we say for Shooters you see the ball go in on a layup or a free throw you could start to see a bigger basket three the oldfashioned way then a three from the island behind the line and hes got six points heres Hammond Ryan again thought about it Starling to the hole Applause Music action that they need they dont have a lot of guys who can put it on the ground certainly nobody like JJ starling Applause the rest of the team is getting energized too as well fivepoint Notre Dame Advantage here Applause largest lead rebound lashewski Music Ben Allen Lubin hes upselling himself found an easy one there hes gonna be a good player though I like Ben Allen Lubin and to be honest with you there are better defensive team when hes on the floor good size very good athlete and hes their first off the bench the true freshman out of Orlando Florida 68 226 back to pain here for Jacksonville nochesky to rebound Music Starlight no work pass a little bit look out foreign Applause Music Grace had really two consecutive guys who are one and done Blake Wesley last year and Starling this year its interesting to sort of make the comparison of when the light came on it was around this time last year for Blake Wesley and you can start to really see it with JJ Starling as he plays more and more with these guys around him yeah Im wondering how its going to go and you know conference play really kicks into high gear to see the development of him as the season progresses Powell missing on the jumper OHearn with the offensive rebound for Jacksonville back to Powell they need this no ohern again and lashesky clears it out you mentioned Starling Garcia no points in the first half five here in the second half with two assists as well three total assists for the game Music and then Cormac Ryan who started oh for seven got a bucket and a foul converted and then he hit a three heres Hammond Music good at creating that space for a shot its one of the reasons he was such a dynamic scorer last year for Greg paulus at Niagara Music Applause Nolan regarded by Wertz its up to three its short lashesky another rebound seven boards now to lead Notre Dame in that department tonight Irish had only 21 points to the first half they had 22 points throughout the first nine minutes and 39 seconds here in the second half could win wow what a take and a finish this is where they could start Notre Dame could start to grind you down because a nine point lead in a game like this is really about 15 so Notre Dame goes on I think its a 90 run stretch this thing and thats a point well taken when youre a team that plays slow down type of basketball right you get into a deficit like this its hard to come back on the board 8 22 remaining the Irish pushed to lead up to nine last year you want to see him get going well he has here tonight yeah sixth game of the year because of that MCL injury before the season started had four threes in the five games coming in hes got three tonight hes three of six really ignited their offense at the end of the first half and has kept it going here hes one of those names Mike Bray mentioned earlier today just kind of shaking his head saying we gotta get Marcus Hammond going Return of the mark and uh not to be confused with Return of the Mac which could have been another uh spatola singing opportunity maybe uh later on in the broadcast well you never know sir the night is still young although were moving through this game at a rapid Pace yeah not a lot of time left here for you my friend 804 remaining Music tonight 610 15 points two boards three assists 19 minutes of action as the Irish lead it by nine here the foul was on a sifo thats the fourth for him for Jacksonville he has since gone out Haynes back in wurtz havent heard too much from him tonight missing on the three there rebound pulled in by Powell works is one for four with two points thank you Hal strong Drive got it very strong Ive seen that a couple of times tonight just using that body Applause that ends nearly a five minute scoring drought for Jacksonville the one for their last eight good one backing his way in on Powell has the advantage and scores Applause all right Music its knee Smith for Davis out of bounds on the sideline Music still a ninepoint game in favor of the Irish year just 6 40 so the orange puns start flying and then Tennessee Clemson game you are looking live at an orange Fest here in Miami yeah thats a good point weve got the show coming up tomorrow and then back out you caught the plug yes made a rock here up in South Bend warts threepointer lucchesky hit a hand on it oh and it got knocked out the last minute by a Vern for Jacksonville its okay its another 20 seconds on that shot clock you know again and again nine point lead ER not to come down with a defensive rebound words to the hole this time its only his fourth point of the ninth two of six in the field but he needed that Notre Dames up double digits now for the first time tonight Music Applause and a foulan starling theres no one tried to take it in Music thought something maybe with Jacksonville trying to create and draw some contact a little bit more right in this game Chris I mean they havent even got to the freethrow line if you can imagine that yeah Notre Dames done a much better job I think in the second half guard in the ball you know theyve guarded their match up and there havent been as many of those straight line drives we saw in the first half Mike and thats how Notre Dame plays they play without fouling there you go to your point and it was a block by Goodwin Starling on the break starling somehow Music youd love to see him just go up and dunk that yeah just just go up to just pound that thing through the rim thats what I thought was gonna happen Ryan thats a good win shot clock and hes bailed out by Dylan ohern with two on the clock first on him Music it was crazy I mean you said it held him on the Baseline that came away with a block started a break thats what they do 20 in the shot clock good one off the inbounds how and he will head to the line and thatll be the first time tonight that Jacksonville will be shooting free throws in this game Jossy Powells been hes been aggressive tonight you know a guy whos been very efficient started his career at division two is that Davis and Elkins College guy whos fitting well in this lineup for Jordan mintzy really solid knows who he is takes good shots hes played well tonight I was on Ben Allen Lubin for another name his first coming up Applause the pal goes two for two hes got 10 points along with Payne the only Jacksonville players in double figures and scoring in this game just five minutes to go Music foreign Applause Applause Music thats impressive off the hands of Payne and words has it Hammond Music foreign from threepoint Reigns now for him tonight Nolan gets a step on Ryan and Cormac Ryan fouls him from behind yeah on the other end I think if your bike Bray you would have liked a few more seconds taken off of that shot clock you know Hammond has played so well tonight so you dont necessarily want to stifle that yeah coach Brady had told us earlier today that sometimes he feels his guys are a little too serious you know out there I mean he said hey just leave us relax its all right you know theyre on this little threegame losing skit but the Marquette lost he said he paid better in Georgia lost there than at Florida State a onepoint loss so I mean think about this with the Florida state one point loss and the Syracuse one point loss bucket or two here and there and theyre nine and three and two and oh in the ACC so things look drastically different so no real reason for major concern but they got to get this one tonight well yeah I I agree with that to a point I I also the Marquette game did was not a good look and Mike Bray said that today he said a game like that can can take a lot out of you the Georgia game where I think he felt like they played better they still lost by 15 15 so Im with you um but theres a lot of room for growth I think with this Notre Dame team Music under four minutes to go in this contest Starlight look at the crossover Applause three minutes and 50 seconds left in this one Notre Dame by 12 these teams here uh Chris even on the court for like a minute theyre standing around like come on come on get back on the break we want to keep going were gonna finish this thing like an hour and 32 minutes like back on guys well be back and here we are with Starling at the line trying to cap off the threepoint play cant do it Music Applause scoring at the halftime those 2119 Notre Dame Applause now its up to a 12 point lead largest of the night Powell for Davis cant get the three and its Tracked Down by Hammond yeah Notre Dames been much better in their mantoman in the second half not as much Zone certainly not as much Zone as they played against Florida State Music Seville one for five from threepoint range in the second frame reversing Notre Dame said five of 11 after they started two of 16 Starlin Music Nolan working on Goodwin its too strong you were saying it earlier Notre Dame should be in no hurry here use up some shot clock and trying to Windle this thing down well thats why we knew when it got to nine and there was an extra possession that Nate lesevski bought his team that increased it to 11 and once you got in the vice grip of this Notre Dame Pace Jacksonville particularly at their Pace theyre just not a team thats equipped to come back words on that last bucket and hes got six and weve got just two minutes and 16 seconds remaining the Irish lead is up to 14 well be back in 30 seconds thanks hopefully for you and your family as you battle through this thinking of you thanks for watching tonight well said Mike I really enjoyed our interactions today with Jordan Mitzi you know I had met him a couple times doing Florida games back when he was an assistant for Mike White but you could tell today hes got a vision for this program and hes got really such great pride in Jacksonville he was talking about all the great things the school is doing the athletic department Music well thats right I mean its uh it startling scores it yeah not just the basketball program all that the you know their whole Administration is doing right now getting behind him and think about it after the great year last year he just got a contract extension its been 203031 season so that kind of shows what they think of mincy in the early going of his young coaching career at Jacksonville funny guys its not easy you know coaching had a program at a mid major anywhere you know there are a lot of great coaches at Mid majors and the problem with the transfer portal right now in college basketball is is better and hes not going to stay there and and the way that Jordan Minskys had to go out and build this program I mean all of these guys are basically transfers and its its just a tough time to be a mid major coach in college basketball because its very hard to hang on to players is there a thought or something that you have that youve thought about over the time that could help that is there a rule or something where you you could do it once or you got to stay for so long I mean I dont know what will you no I mean they they have they have instituted that rule where you you can do it once um you know theres nobody in charge I mean this is a much longer conversation but I mean theres nobody in charge theres nobody so even if you have transferred once guys have been allowed to do it again multiple times you know we have a new head of the of the NCAA which is great and I enjoy I like the higher but until we know what the structure and what the ncaas role is going to be its hard to to really say what this thing should look like but it is its hard the portal has made life very hard for these mid major coaches Music well over the last two or three years I mean just think about everything thats weve gone through and all these coaches have gone through uh covet transfer final and nil like lets double trouble going the other way and thats a lot of change in a short amount of time and and a lot of it for the better I mean you know a lot of its stuff that needed to change but I think were trying to wrap our heads around exactly how this thing is going to function and thank you its not easy you had talked about a couple of the Florida transfers and one of them there with osayo sifo number 15 for Jacksonville who we caught up with earlier and he said that you know he was excited to come here he wanted a place where he was able to be able to contribute more and lead more and he has that opportunity here and put in that time with minsey when he was at Florida that certainly helps the cause he knows what hes going to get Wayne takes it in for Notre Dame its tipped up and in by Matt Zona Chris first points of the season and you saw the graphic there a moment ago about what Jacksonville has done when holding opponents under 60 points and how successful theyve been its just that they werent able to put up the numbers offensively tonight not gonna win many games with just 43 obviously and Notre Dames going to go to 223 at home since the start of 202122 the crowd could arise to their feet here as theyve outscored Jacksonville 299 in the final 13 and a half minutes Applause the last time Notre Dame won a game when scoring under 60 points is back on January 3rd 2018 well they do it tonight 5943 the final over Jacksonville and they step a threegame losing skip its good to get in the wind column if youre Notre Dame I thought they played a much better second half theyve got a big one here coming up this week theyre in a Joyce Center against Miami
