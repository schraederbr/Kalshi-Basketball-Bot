9 the other night at Duke Syracuse was an 8471 winner at home against Virginia Tech Huntley Hatfield Malik Brown get a started terrific crew tonight Ron Gro Mark snner and Jerry heer on the whistle here at the Y Center this is sky Clark Mike James and very quickly with white the other two starters are the Freshman Caleb Glenn and of course Brandon Huntley Hatfield and inside quickly here is that young freshman Glenn strong to the basket rebound pulled away by Malik Brown and look at this lineup for the orange this is the 15th straight game they have gone with Taylor mint Starling Brown and you mentioned Bells shooting prowess here as of late too inside is Justin Taylor sophomore got stuck threw it away to Clark here the cards trying to create transition and its Glenn to the basket and it rolls off the rim thats one you have to have if youre Louisville trying to gained some confidence at the beginning of this contest is going to be critical for the cards who at times struggle a little bit but defensively sky Clark playing really way playing really well away from the basketball well the Cardinal starters this is the six time theyve used this lineup with white Clark James The Freshman Glenn and Huntley Hatfield theyre only one and four in the five games theyve started this Applause lineup orangs were fortunate there not to have another turnover get a reset of the shot clock look at Min theres the start and stop youre talking about inside Brown to work knocked out of bounds turned over to the C Judah men has to survey the floor better whenever youre handling the basketball at the top of the key and youre coming off a ball screen dont go to the strong side they had two players on that side of the floor make sure that youre operating in space because thats where hes at his best its about surveying that portion of the floor before you make your move to the cup Syracuse spent a lot of time today talking about forcing players in certain directions off that screen at the top and what Kenny Paynes team does spinning into traffic James couldnt finish he got knocked around last Touch by the Applause orange itll stay with the cards and 12 to shoot here and there is 57yearold Kenny Payne now in his second year it is Alba Applause Mar Kenny Payne talked a little bit about how Syracuse switches defense is a little bit more manto man this year but theyll go back and forth out of the corner the three ball James and heres the orange were still scoreless almost two minutes in on the drive the Scoop from Starling and a foul JJ Sterling just took initiative thats one thing he can do so blindingly quick in the open floor he gets ahead of steam watch out my one critique there if Im Chris Bell Ive shot the cover off the ball the entire month of February hes got to run the floor down of the corner hey Im a guy who focuses on those guys right well like I I really pay attention what the shooters are doing away from the basketball you have to put yourself in position to have success he hit eight threes in a row against NC State earlier this season right what ends up happening is sometimes guys get a little bit lazy and waiting for it do your early work get to your spots he would have had a wide open three in the right corner Starling hit the first missed the second first points of the game belonged to Jonathan e Starling Jr Clark in the Ville here Brown fronting Huntley Hatchy here is Brandon working inside on a double team and scor eight double doubles this year for him ter thats four in ACC play including 11 and 10 the other night at Duke thats an an Im bigger than you bucket thats all that is if youre Malik Brown you had help coming from the Baseline side jump up on top make him spin into that help B the Fall Away there you go on Q from Oglesby Chris Bell puts the orange back in front hes certainly capable of that little Iverson cut one dribble pull up hes a good athlete Im a become a fan of Chris Bell and hes starting to figure out how to score without the basketball white Miss Glenns tap wouldnt go look at mint skip it for starlings three rimmed off rebound for Huntley Hatfield Syracuse is a better transition team teren and I think they get credit for when you have two guards that can take off like that and read the opposite side Caleb Glenn Louisvilles junkyard dog if you will nothing outside of 10 ft for that that young man but he plays hard hes around the cup and whenever you sprint the floor West and you put yourself in position you front help sides a little late Big Time finish yep so here is Glenn whos just a 58 free throw shooter only his 20th attempt of the year hes got three cards are back in Applause front Starling heres Brown Bell a shot fake will carry him toward the Baseline got white in the air and will draw the foul great defense until the last minute yep but thats the respect that Bell you have to give him because he shot the ball so well as of late you cant lose your discipline at the last second stay straight up maintain your verticality Trey white hes an equally good athlete make him make a tough shot over top Chris Bell Only Hits seven the other night against Virginia Tech look at the confidence theyve got here theyre clearing the lane for Chris Bell Syracuse is dont worry about the rebound because there wont be one and Bell makes them both hasnt missed one in the last five games hes only had 29 attempts on the year its interesting mint most teams in NCAA D1 dont shoot as many free throws as mince does he 245 attempts coming into the game heres Clark a three Starling the rebound thats much better defense by Malik Brown Jump completely on the high side Starling and thats going to be offensive on mint red alry does not like the call by Jerry heer on the sophomore mints his first its a second on the orange here third turnover on Syracuse you think he had him Square West Im not quite sure on that one hey Im Im Jerry Im Jerry heers biggest fan I want to make that clear Im not sure I agreed with that call yeah no no Im Im with you on that and off the ball theres going to be a foul on Clark underneath the basket skot Clark picks up his first by the way we got as many fouls as the teams have points here in the first almost four minutes and only not step because you see some games this time of year where theyre no foul NC State today didnt shoot a free throw in the first half against Carolina and Chapel Hill they didnt make a bucket in the second half for about 12 minutes on the drive here is men cant get there rebounded by Clark heres white with a pass first basket for White cards back in front thats sky Clark making things happen and Trey white understanding if I run the Lane Im going to be able to get opportunities Taylor with a right hand tough shot he made it Justin Taylor who had 66 rebounds the other night averages less than three and a half and three in the league and that ball deflected by Taylor and fires ahead for Bell oh Chris Bell turns it over for his second field goal hes got six game starting to loosen up a little bit live ball turnovers lead to easy buckets with consistency especially West with two teams that have the individual talent that both of these squads do kind of a half windmill F Bell and heres Taylor with another steal and hes going to duck it home and draw the foul Caleb BL Glenn is going to commit the foul Justin Taylor backto back dunks by the orange here to live ball turnovers will kill you West First Chris Bell little windmill here in Louisville and Justin Taylor he said what you can do sir I can do almost

you by Food Lion heres Syracuse in the month of February we talked about this at the top the push now is on got to be a little more than considered maybe going into the final week dont you I I think you need to win this one and you need to put a put a heck of a fight up at Clemson coming up Tuesday I mean thats going to be a handful on PJ Hall senior night lets not get get it twisted that Clemson teams really really good right but if youre going to give yourself a chance I mean you have to be really close in that one I think they have to win a game or two in the ACC tournament to at least warrant that kind of Rec recogition but by all means I think red ay and what theyve done this season theyve trans transitioned to new head coach Yep theyre doing a lot of different things defensively playing more man which Syracuse fans seem to have been clamoring for for the past forever right and now theyre just now starting to find their Rhythm and I dont think its going anywhere I think theres going to be continued progression with this program at Syracuse because kids want to play for the orange heres White working around Starling for the bucket second field though for Trey white Trey Whites talented yes he is from Dallas transfer from Southern Cal all packed well freshman team member I mean a guy that can really score and hes pesky and Bell had it knocked away good save by Brown to Bell tend to shoot put it in the hands of the guy who can dial it up there he is step back three over the top of Clark for Judah Min if hes able to do that Wes I dont know how you defend him because he attacks the rim at such a high level and he gets you on your heels if hes knocking down threes tough cover yep he had 21 in the first meeting but Drew nine fouls that night too well keep an eye on that as the game progresses on the drive there goes James and the rebound pulled away by Brown and here goes Starling and theyre running again Bell the look away three one and done the orange that Balls going up is it yep fast too here is white trying to shake Taylor Clark and boy Taylor doing a nice job playing around the edge here on Trey white we talk about Judah men how good he is off the bounce is just a little size up and you have to respect his ability to get to the cup will step back and pull the only thing is whenever hes in the midrange because he brings that ball across his face he elevates really well whenever he has to back up a little bit Wes takes him a extra half second to get that shot off but thats being picky I mean this is a guy that can really score Tyler Johnson Fresh Off the Bench launches a three that bounds away the Freshman from Brooklyn averaging nine points four assists in conference play theyre two loaded up on one side nice job rebalancing by Justin Taylor and now you can start to penetrate and kick around Starling to the basket offensive foul thatll be his second first player in the game with two is JJ Starling I love it Dad you have to love it when coaches kid gets in the way nice job getting in front takes it in the chest T Pain yeah averages about 8 minutes a game against the league NOS his roll comes in mhm Music did not play the other night at Duke has not scored in his last six appearances did play a minute in the regular season meeting at Syracuse back on February 7th Huntley Hatfield to work wow strong move with the right hand and thats not Malik Brown thats Justin Taylor on the backside Malik was fully expecting him to come over and give help with that double team Taylor has to know that thats coming what a pretty pass there Brown the basket his first Terrence sixpoint lead for the orange Mal Brown his impact isnt going to come just from scoring he he hes an all the other things guy right he communicates defensively incredibly long wingspan rebounds well this is something theyre going to have to knock out though because Huntley Hatfields a problem in the paint Music yep he had what 19 points and 13 rebounds in the first meeting and with a sixpoint lead heres the orange again and Bell tes up a three Chris Bell now with nine in this first half he has that much space just go ahead and start jogging to the other end the Miss Jumper by white cashed in quickly at the other Music end Johnson all the way through heres James with tend to Applause shoot white again pull up two minz the oneand clutch rebound hey but if Im Louisville Im not mad at that possession behind the back for Taylor and he got the foul from Payne xan Paynes first fifth on the cards here in the opening half then Syracuse doing their best work in transition West moving the ball and Chris Bell got to get a hand up that man is dangerous lets do another round you can do it in this Clinic we pride ourselves on putting

with Terrence Oglesby Wester you talked about Chris Bell early hes delivered he doesnt need a lot of room and whenever hes putting it on the deck and hes able to finish that makes it so tough but he understands its a process of learning how to play alongside really talented guards you run the floor you move without the basketball and youre constantly repositioning uh Chris Bells starting to figure that out whenever Judah Miss is scoring 18 these things are going to open up for you and over the last month hes finally found his rhythm this guys talented and he has a lot of tools in terms of a three and D candidate and some of some things of that nature I uh I enjoyed our visit with red alry today Adrian was very I thought he was very insightful about where they are offensively and what his expectation of them offensively is and it and it varied from player to player what an impressive guy is red arrey Syracuse is in good hands oh thats for sure I mean I really enjoy talking its the first time Ive ever sat down and talked to Red yeah Tyler missed them both 75 free throw shooter so it stays a ninepoint game Emanuel aor for s more from Nigeria wearing 34 just got think he just bang knees with somebody hes come up hobbling a little bit inside against Brown meanwhile there goes Tyler Johnson flying through the air gets the bouns for his first basket Baseline Drive Baseline drift drives the middle Tyler Johnson has a lot of skill extremely quick now you see little two3 matchup for Louisville and Zan pay just leaves the ball and mits lob little high for Justin Taylors collection heres white trying to take advantage kick for James is three thats another rebound look at the lead for copelan quadir oh no look out lost his shoe jumped out of his shoe and carries it back down the floor if he knocks away with a shoe in the left hand it would have been unbelievable by the way Copeland slides the Nike right back on extra propulsion from the young man from Philadelphia here holy smokes he Dunked On Everybody in the Yum Center and then just drew a foul at the other end with a shoe in his hand live ball turnovers and bad shots my word quader Co I call him the microphone a lot of people call call people the microwaves because they score quick Im calling him the microphone cuz he was the loudest guy at shoot around today by a country mile oh yeah Scott Clark with his first basket what a finish building recovering from Copelands dunk Im Applause recovering okay so this is a 23 they start out as a 131 and it slides back into a two3 and they match accordingly you know cor for in the middle he has to defend in oneonone if hes going to be able to stay in look at copelan good defensive possession now to start this game Louisville did a nice job of Defending that fell by the wayside thatll bounce off a COR for nice over the top rebound from behind Brown Adrien alry talked today how big they are remaining Louisville Johnson tried to deliver a core for a gift wrap box couldnt handle it all Emanuel is going to have to do is catch it and lay it in the rim and now under nine to go its a sevenpoint lead again heres mint right to the basket and scores lot of contact five for Judah minz but Terrence he shows you so much when he does so little sometimes right thats exactly right and and a lot of times hell take steps and hell take a step with the same foot its its kind of strange to watch but hes very economical with his feet and how he attacks the bucket Johnson slashing through score second will go for the Freshman from Brooklyn tough kid tough kid hes still learning the college game though I mean he came in early and and the thing is he has to learn to be patient plays very impatient right now what a move Min to the basket a core four blocked it Louisville trying to get a transition chance started heres Clark all the way down kicks it back for Johnson Miss badley now heres the run out for Judah minz with Johnson trailing and def has his third field Music goal lead is nine Clark the other way they crash the glass and I think this is going to be on Copeland hey W Ive seen Ive seen a lot of dunks this year this got to be top five with here Copeland let me get it from Above the Rim my my my putting on a show here at the Music Y its bow time whats that the bojangler from bojangler with the same Bold Flavor as their chicken

and a presidential scholar at Central peont Community Music College well dont forget another busy Tuesday night of ACC basketball right here on acc Network well have Coach Bon Cory Alexander myself and Chapel Hill at 700 for senior night for amondo bot Carolina and the Irish for the first time then Georgia Tech at Wake Forest by the way a double header follows this and RJ Davis last two games only 147 and five today everything looks a little soft after you throw 42 on the board too hes been amazing all season long and hey look I was critical of Carolina last year but what Huberts done with that roster hes bit him perfect around what RJ Davis is in Bott and Im happy that you but Im that youre going to be a chavel hill Im even more happy that Cory Alexander is going to going to be there for Armando botts senior night because nobody loves Armando Bott like Cory like Cory thats right uh some are beginning to wonder if Cory might be getting a letter jacket in Carolina this year lob went wild recovered and scored by The Freshman Glenn what what turned into a what a horrible possession can become a shiny item right look at this unbelievable off the glass that is incredible thats Caleb Glenn just doing what he does though I mean the skill level needs to catch up but he understands where he can make an impact 16 foul on the Orange is the third on Copeland so Starling and Copeland both with two or more Copelands thirdd and Glenn cant hit the free throw Brown rips away the rebound I think the best way to describe that possession was accidentally awesome probably right is that right yeah so Copeland off the floor and Kyle cuff the Junior from Harlem who started his career at Kansas whose dad was a remarkable player at St Johns in the early part of this Century hard believe I say that Cur and Curtis Williams commits the Louisville foul off the ball his first thats six now on the cards so Kyle cuff into the game he wears zero for Syracuse you see Curtis Williams on the floor for the first time hes the 65 freshman from Detroit who I thinks got a terrific future ahead of him talented kid yep here is mince digging down on Johnson Tyler and theres going to be a foul on Johnson before the rejection by James its a bad matchup for for Louisville isnt it its a bad matchup and its bad defense by Johnson because youre not going to block this shot the best you can do is stay straight up and then you have help coming Mike James hes in your kitchen hes helping you out let your defense come over youre 6 feet tall youre not blocking any shots especially on the ball and for that matter Wes not many people are right play straight up let that second Defender come over and Applause help Kenny pays a little frustrated so is the partisan Cardinal fans nine in the half for Mintz the orange lead is nine Judah minz is continuing a very nice February into march here tonight Terren James threw it out of bounds wild throw I think he was looking for Williams turned over by the cards in Louisvilles first 15 minutes of the game almost Terren there way too many of those type plays right and not only that its a Louisville team thats the worst threepoint shooting team in this conference and what ends up happening is theyre all attacking the rim they get so topheavy everybodys below the the free throw line and its led to a lot of leak outs whether it be dunks or open threes in transition you got to stay on your feet you got to have somebody at least get back look at the movements put on James couldnt bury the shot blend the rebound Johnson in the front court now that thats a point where Johnsons going to learn as he gets older hey if I slow down I can flow right into a drag ball screen and its going to make my job a lot easier a lot quicker theyre almost going to give Johnson that straightway three heres James with seven to shoot Huntley Hatfield and the rebound pulled away and the stick back by Glenn seven for Glenn averaging just five against the league how athletic is he very can get off the floor started at Louisville Male Hometown kid yep here is brown what a pass and a foul will be called on Glenn Mark snner the whistle on the Freshman his second thats eight on Louisville hes the first Cardinal with two tonight played at lamir in Indiana after yep his high school career mail here in Louisville Caleb Glenn his dad was a wide receiver in football here for the Cardinals Brown misses the free throw first of two for Malik Brown and Glenn is out Trey white has come back to join James Williams Huntley Hatfield and the Freshman Johnson second for brown is Applause good Malik Browns got three Louisvilles lead or Louisvilles deficit is eight Syracuse playing more Zone towards the end of the year quite frankly coach arrey said it has everything to do with depth and theyve had guys fall in and out of the lineup they got to keep guys on the floor you got to stay out of foul trouble and thats one thing that does occur whenever youre playing that zone you got Starling and Copeland with two and three respectively so cuffs going to get some minutes here and Johnson stole it from Bell but couldnt collect it before it hit the scores table Louisvilles been a completely different team defensively whenever theyre able to either have a dead ball turnover or score theyre setting up theyve had a really hard time exhibit a and Williams blocked by Bell and recovered by Taylor here is mince all the way to the other end and he left it short and out of bounds itll belong to the cards look at this sequence at 94 feet great defense by Williams gets out the passing Lane hes Off to the Races thinks he has the easy one no sir Chris Bell what a mat I have two questions when we have our next dead ball two questions no no I never blocked a shot like that thats not one of them nice pass really nice pass three ball out of the corner by white seven for Trey white he and Caleb Glenn have 14 of Louisvilles 26 the cards to within three here is mitz and Taylor turns it over all right itll go to Louisville now two questions one heres the steal by Williams why doesnt he dunk this I think he thought he was open maybe so back at the other end what a mince dunk it youre allowed to dunk right Dan Peters are statistician hes with me neither one of us have dunked Ive never dunked too maybe 50 career dunker in the ACC thats important so my question is this why not dunk it nonetheless threepoint game we just saw it at both ends in sequential plays James digs in hard on the dribble and stolen by Music Brown thats a play that Malik Brown wouldnt have been able to make last year hes put on a lot of weight what a strong defensive effort Starling on the floor with the fouls misses the jumper Hunley hadfi in the cards with a chance to tie on the drive Johnson needs Williams He spins through and stepped out of bounds just seems like everythings a day late and a dollar short offensively for the cards trying to battle back in it theyre doing it with their Music defense investment opportunities are everywhere you turn do you charge forward freezing your tracks or let curiosity light the way at Tio price we ask smart questions about opportunities like advances in healthcare and how these Innovations will create a healthier world tomorrow better questions better outcomes Im a guy who lost a bet and my dignity get out of the way as

story about a girl my goodness Hannah Sheed around like she ran the world is on fire walked around she knew everything Rivers yeah back down to kissed her R shes the it girl she cant control it the moment is here who will meet it The Ally ACC womens basketball tournament first round begins Wednesday at 1 on accn well Wes Louisville starting to slow this game down but earlier in this game Syracuse in transition was awesome because theres nobody back on defense and as a result they got some wide open opportunities including this one which was just silly Quest quer Copeland the microphone with a pass here as well I mean this Syracuse team they get out in the open floor difficult to defend because they have so many good athletes but on the other end Louisville the more they move the ball and have these longer possessions right the better off they usually are simply because they have guys back on defense and they know where the shots coming from if its a live ball turnover you can forget its Syracuse Electric in the open floor by the way despite the field goal drought the arms still shooting 56 from the floor in the first half and only only two threes for a team that averages right at seven we dont expect a lot of Threes to be made tonight had one more oh but theres a reach in on Applause Williams second foul on Curtis Williams is nine on Louisville I will say the Orange is only seven of 11 at the free throw line they come into the contest 722 in conference play Louisville is 75 of the line and here is here is Bell for the front end of a one and one I like that set coming out of a timeout MH Iversons cut over the top and then they turn down and rescreen Bell to come up and get a shot and Bell just uses his few years in college to get the Freshman a foul Bells another guy who benefited from the off season bell added some weight 10 lbs of muscle to his frame he was lean as a 2 Stak a year ago James inside and ball out of bounds James wanted a foul didnt get it Louisville thought that they were going to get a whistle not only the players on the floor the partisans here with to and I Crow crowd a little Surly behind us on the no whistle there for a foul Starling M kept it and put the ball on the floor before he stepped smart play pull up got it thats where hes so good 12 to 15 ft elevates over the top hes got good size about 64 you put Johnson on hims significantly smaller you got to send that second Defender there quick wait the Lost Art of the midrange jumper is that what it is yeah he never lost it needs to find his three ball if hes able to do that I mean I dont know how you defend him another miss the lead is five now for the orange feels like a pretty big 220 here for louville here is Bell oh mince to Brown for the hammer Judah Mintz is showing you the full bag here in the first half and a timeout for Kenny pay the lead goes to seven just like that mint a pullup jumper then Brown The Music Dump depend keeps you drier than ever so you can say yes to more than ever yes yes yes no depend the only thing stronger than us is you IHOP has tons of omelets so you can have omelets for breakfast brunch Briner or even a brittle of the nights snack try the new meaty cheesy and crispy Mega omelet and add cinnamon Dippers for a dollar only at IHOP well Malik Browns dunk the latest Salvo from the orange who have scored four in a row here to push it to seven with 21 to go and I was just asking you about how important the final two and A2 might be for the cards and then mince hits the pullup jumper and now brown the dunk off the uh pretty good execution the half court it is but its also a late rotation uh coming down on the other end and were going to see a ball screen coming taking out keep an eye on number five Brandon Huntley Hatfield on the Baseline side I know this is a tough angle hes got to come over follow the basketball hes a day late and a dollar short if he rotates correctly early in the possession hes going to be much better off to be that helps side Defender long three off of Clarks hand and Mark nurse at last touched Louisville so itll belong to Syracuse so scoring drought for the cards now just inside of 3 minutes and now all of a sudden 153 to go and four in a row here by Syracuse to push it to seven Starling back out there hell rck back down the lane High arker over Huntley had feel good for JJ Starling first field goal hes got three tough tough move he actually had the entire Baseline side saw Justin Taylor coming over flipped the screen got middle Sterling terrific athlete finishes over the top Tyler Johnson through traffic and the rebound pulled away by Brown Here Comes Starling Again Taylor oh he tried to hit I think Brown coming down the lane and sailed it back out over the top and Mark snur going to do a little bit of housekeeping here hell stop the play Applause with 71 seconds left and of course the auto owners insurance halftime tune in coming up here at the break Syracuse on the considered list coming into todays play plus more look around the ACC whats already been a busy day there are theres a drive and score by men men now give Syracuse their largest lead its delayed scissors action they werent even really in position but if youre not engaged off the ball you can forget it y theres the drive rebound horrible shot heres Taylor trying to create initiative hell give it to Starling 10c differential as we work to the end of the half here Im not willing to pull punches you cant cant take that shot right there y youre stuck dribble that ball out play off two feet kick the ball out eight to shoot look at Starling over the top of Huntley Hatfield itll Rim off Brown tried to keep it alive and saved it but theable sky Clark with nine bounc past Johnson right back layup good and thats James just how they drew it up and a timeout with 51 left to go cuts it back to single figures at Music nine somebodys got to get back on defense Min was there its got to be that extra guy but and there is James getting what is just his second field goal Terrence we were talking youre going to hear with Kelsey and the crew coming up here at the break theyre already five finals today top four received the double bu Wade Forest has had a tough week yeah after that massive win that they so desperately needed against Duke right put themselves in position for the NCAA tournament then drop a couple thats tough all right so in your mind who are you more concerned about with a week to go in the regular season Steve Forbes or Tony Bennett as far as getting in the tournament yes sir I would say Steve Forbes and wake fores they need to finish off strong uh especially after campaigning in the manner that they have lately right they need to finish off and then they probably need to win a game in the ACC tournament just so they leave no doubt what a set a hammer at the horn by Judah minz how does that happen mint has got 15 at the break and the last one yes I think hes special in that regard well hes got 15 to lead everybody in this first half and with the lead the orangs have the ball trying to win for the fourth straight time it would be five out of six and theres a foul called off the ball by Mark Schnur and it is on Trey white his second the first of the half on the cards whoa wait a second tos first team all ACC here it is in the first hold on nine seconds of the second half we might as well we start talking about it PJ Hunter Salis has been terrific obviously filipowski has been good uh Judah men between him and Blake Henson uhhuh for that fifth spot my mind Blake Hensons been great for pit Jud Judah menz though so good what a shot ball away bounds away Clark and the cards on the run and James had it blocked off the glass by Starling here comes the Ys the other way and Men hits Brown who cant finish it Taylor saved it Starling bangs a Applause three what a play and why does that happen you miss a layup you dont get off the floor in time to get back and get in the play defensively its a reoccurring theme for this Louisville team 14point lead largest to the night for the orange Zone again and Glenn lost it off his shoe James fires back through Clark launching front rim Miss heres Starling on the run out again JJ thought about good recognition thats a sophomore guard at the into his sophomore season realizing I dont have any options here M into traffic Starling Bell for three it got partially blocked by James Bell thought he was fouled heres a lead and Glenn another catch at the glass and a score nine for Glenn on his fourth field Applause goal lot to like about freshman Caleb Glenn by the way well hes Underside doesnt have much of a jump shot if any at all and he just finds ways to impact the game with his effort I love guys like that b pulls up knocks down the two 11 for Bell his six double figure effort in the last eight hes a Know Your Role AllAmerican right one inside of one dribble catch and shoot knows what hes good at plays defense Im a fan heres Glenn against Taylor and one tale of Glenn fouled by Justin Taylor and thats going to put Glenn to the strike for a chance to convert the threepoint trip here hes into double figures by the way third time in the last six games for Caleb Glenn giving a crash course on how to attack the two3 Zone last possession they go high post and then try a bounce pass in this time short corner to a guy diving Clen able to get there there knocks down the free throw his second threepoint trip of the night got a dozen and he leads the cards in scoring came in to averaging five points against the league talk about having a strong kick in the final turn of the regular season thats Caleb Glenn for Kenny Payne Clark touched it last its going to stay with Syracuse and now we got a technical foul on mince I think he hid the ball when Mark snner wanted the ball minys calm down and sit down yeah mince is arguing with and hes going to come out of the ball game I dont know what in the world happened over there but it ended up in a technical foul and Adrien alri and Judah minz not happy and here is James at the line 11th best free throw shooter in the ACC at 81 for the technical foul the guy in James whos having a bad game so far only two and N from the field the last thing you need to do for a guy who can get hot put him on the free throw line mince thought he got fouled hes driving right swipe down goes out of bounds hes asking for the foul call and then just wouldnt stop when the official warned him so and snner Mark snner pretty good official now and all of a sudden Min is holding the ball and he pulled it away from SN and thats why he got the technical why wouldnt you just give the ball to Mark snner I I think that was more reactionary I I Ill be honest I dont love that technical foul its emotional game dont take that out of it Taylor air ball the jump shot thats down to Applause nine James boy the cards can get Mike James going that would be a boost for Kenny pay Caleb Glenns already off to a terrific start in the second half theres an airball from White Hunley Hatfield savs it but still tend to shoot a tough shot and score for Trey white hes got nine the lead seven four in a row by The Ville sometimes its not always pretty but if the efforts there to move the basketball youre going to find Avenues to score Trey white so athletic around the cup nice pass heres Brown to try and cut a seven nothing run short and he does so a seven in a row by Louisville and now a foul good effort Huntley Hatfield rumbling bumbling stumbling almost West doesnt have to be pretty as long as you get those two points Trey white he has a lot of natural Talent long arm 67 can score I think picking his spots is somewhere he needs to improve wow look at Brown go get it and hes fouled by James Brown ends up falling out of bounds in the corner near the photographers well he was the shooter yep sure was and nobody was on the lane so Brown chased it how does that happen that cannot happen thats two things in this game Wes where you youre you see something happen you just scratch your head a free throw line box out where the only person on the lines the free throw shooter and at half court where the five mans up past half courtt trying to pressure and you get a wide open layup these things cant happen in ACC play ever yep heres Copeland and hes fouled by Glenn and couple of free throws will be coming there third on Caleb Glenn third on Louisville hey Caleb Glenn he he has the body to be an elite Defender y he does need to learn that when somebodys attacking you put your arms out you attack them with your chest and youre going to be able to have success you cant put two hands on the ball handler Tyler Johnson will check in and Glenns going to go out Starling out in the midcourt area now with Taylor copelan Brown and Chris Bell the microphone survey surveying the floor look oh what a shot holy smokes hes talented isnt he cop one has a dunk where he lost a shoe and now he went 360 hes a whirling dervish this guy holy smokes hes had two field goals tonight he doesnt have to score for the rest of the month he wont find better highlights he was telling everybody in the building about it on the way back down and James draws the fou theyre going to have to stack stops West if

Music fresh theres one thing that never changes GE the anticipation GE Music the sixpoint lead for the orange interesting second half weve seen a little bit of everything and we hadnt quite played six minutes Terrence no we havent but heres the thing Mike James hes been a guy that whenever Louisvilles playing well and they have been spurts during this season hes a guy that when they play well he needs to play well because that energy that effort uh getting to the cup if hes finishing some of these shots they dont have to get back in transition defense and they can set their defense when theyve set their defense today I think Louisville has been pretty good theres been a couple of mental lapses but not not all that many heres Brown had it poked away recovers fires it into Copeland Min has returned to the lineup he gets into traffic and thatll be a block thats a good call yep sure is Jerry heer with the whistle on skot Clark itll be his second four now on the cards its a good call Jerry heer and the emphasis this season has been on this block charge and most of these calls are going to the off defensive player you have to get there extremely early last year thats a charge right this year you have to get there on the initial gather step Clark just a half second too late as the secondary Defender first of two for mint no good hey Louisville just hanging around at home just hanging around sure are but theres some general confusion if youre guarding the basketball and youre the primary Defender you can still get over over and take that charge in the chest which we saw in the first half but that secondary Defender the help Defender you have to be there extremely early 16 for mint first points in the second half by the Applause way lead is seven and mince does a great job of whipping that ball screen in the zone Johnson a standing three and copeling the rebound what a terrific box out by Brown underneath by the way against Huntley had field ball screen freeze Mets on the dribble here look at this work great pass C there caught it and foul to begging for another highlight field goal fromer cop thats the only way he scores Wes its a trueu thats the only way he scores now good cut recognition right Louisville is extremely cognizant of when Judah menz has the basketball against Tyler Johnson and as a result that second defenders coming over as soon as he turned his head it was sky Clark as soon as sky Clark turned his head quer Copeland cuts to the rim and he gets a wide open look at it dont forget the allly ACC Womens Basketball Tournament begins on Wednesday at the coliseum in Greensboro every match up but the title game is right here on acc Network in the ESPN app first round coverage starts at 1230 Eastern with a nothing but neth crew from the gate City and theres a quick look at the standings and you see Virginia Tech Syracuse NC State right Music there so one of two free throws for cop and at the other end a foul or no ball got kicked didnt yep ball got kicked heres James tend to shoot floater by Johnson Huntley Hatfields been quiet tonight he scores on the stick back he need to for Brandon he needs to be ready that ball gets to the high post have your hands ready and be ready to explode Applause up heres Copeland rolling on Johnson into traffic scores easily its a mismatch win right Im bigger than you yep thats all that is seven for Copeland five in the half lead to eight eight now for the orangs trying to win on the road for the third time in the league and the fourth time this year and a three ball from White second three of the night for the softball from Dallas quick ball movement sharp passes a dozen for Trey Applause white fivepoint game Bell answers just start running back at that point he gets a clean look

you some some of the lines here from the first meeting how about that you you had your basic uh eight guys in double figures right McCain had 23 first time he ever walked in the door at Chapel Hill bunch bunch of buckets yeah bunch of buckets ex talented also chances thing could determine the regular season along the way too the top seat in the tournament thats next Saturday night home teams have won every game with the exception of one so far of the Five played Notre Dame leading Clemson in the final minute at South Bend pit beat at pit one at Boston College and Syracuse trying to win here that would make home teams 5 and two on the day and a side note to that we came into the day with 36 games of the conference scheduled being five or less or overtime we will have had none today its 28 of the games Terren thats a very low number for this league being five or less that ball got knocked out of bounds itll belong to the orange to give you some idea there have only been five overtime ACC games this year the last one was January 24th wow NC State Virginia Charlottesville four fouls on Copeland by the way was that the same game where Virginia shot one of 11 from the free throw line and still won the game no that was the Wake Forest that was the Wake Forest game four foul second half on on uh Syracuse by the way and mince what a handful draws a foul its unbelievable red ay has Supreme confidence in V because he attacked got stopped reack got stopped sky Clark played great defense for three Drive attempts and then gets greedy on the last second I actually think theres a lot of ball with that shot atemp by the way that is seven fouls on Louisville with 1124 to play Third on Clark so Min the front end of the one And1 this guy goes to the line by the way Relentless this is his sixth attempt of the night to give him 251 on the year 11point lead for Syracuse Orange trying to win for the four straight time they shot 57 the other night beating Virginia teag theres one knocked away from James heres transition roll again and that is a scoring drive by Starling eight for Starling wide ball turnovers you cannot defend if youre not in front what did Kenny Payne say to us in our visit pregame we had 17 turnovers they had 23 points in the first meeting 33 points theres the Miss and recovered at range by white and that got blocked from behind by Bell good second effort bred ay thrilled eight nothing run the last two and change Syracuse has hit their last six shots on the Applause floor there goes Mintz feeds Taylor Up and Under for the basket come on and thatll be a timeout for the cards and three in the Orange is running the show tonight at the Young Center theyre up 15 you can feel confident Continental is the Smart Choice in tires can they handle extremes yep tested from the Texas desert to near the Arctic Circle really really anything for the guy who finds that one pothole yeah road hazard coverage has her back for real absolutely were they made by like a bajillion Engineers well closer to 100 Continental Welcome to the smart choice and Music tires 15point lead 6247 10 nothing run here in the last two minutes for the orangs too juds acting silly and heres the thing if youre guarding the ball look at number ones head as soon as he focuses away from the cup and he thinks a screens coming that might as well be a green light hes turned down ball screens today three to four times and hes ended up at the rim if youre guarding somebody as dynamic as that you have to send him to where the helps at Wes thats not very good defense and thats a young player not understanding that when Im playing somebody I have to send him to where that extra guy is he turns that screen hes on a highway to the rim its a really easy chance to finish a play and another turnover forced out of the zone and back here goes the challenge again for Louisville Min at the front working on Clark shook him on a bounce got into trap traffic fed be brown and got shoved thatll be a foul on the Applause cards hes controlling the game off the dribble let alone what he does when he gets the ball of the rim he is he just takes his time and hes getting wherever he wants and by calling for the ball screen it leaves the guy guarding him guessing and hes trying his best to stay away from that extra Defender and as a result theres nobody there until he gets to that second line and thats when decision making happens and quite frankly thats where hes improved the most throughout his career in a Syracuse uniform early in his career that extra pass he made to Jason Taylor earlier yeah or Justin Taylor excuse me earlier that wouldnt have happened he would have shot it now hes become much more accustom to be that primary ball handle and creating not just for himself but for the other guys exhibit a as Malik Brown hits a free throw so Brown makes the free throw quick reminder to you a new edition of all access the ACC live premieres Monday tonight featuring the number five Virginia Tech womens basketball team pit gymnastics Miami womens golf unprecedented access into the lives of student athletes coaches and staff 700 eastern it follows pack and Taylor on acc PM right here on accn Brown hit of both hes got seven he there is a lot that one heres another steel Min will feed Taylor Up and Under again and a foul called as Taylor I think took some contact and heres the problem with Tyler Johnson being out on the floor right now since hes a nonshooter mince has completely backed off into the paint yeah and since Johnsons not a threat from Beyond The Arc he just sits back in that passing Lane those things like these are small things I if if youre not a threat from right there make a quick hard pass and at least get that ball moving Louisville whenever theyre not dribbling against the Zone theyve had some success getting it around the perimeter problem is whenever Johnsons catching it he immediately puts it on the deck Justin Taylor miss the front of the two for red alry lead is 17 and it stays there and Johnson brings a lot of positives I dont want to be too hard on the kid but a lot of these things good extra pass but the problem is it goes over his head theyre just not sharp movements and sharp passes its a bounce here its a fumbled there and this is a great possession Hunley Hatfield raped out of there but a foul called on the orange be the fifth called on Syracuse and its on Justin Taylor his second and it is five on the orange and number five for the cards will shoot free throws thats Brandon Huntley Hatfield at 66 hes now got seven in the game but that ball went from right corner to 45 to 45 to other Corner quick attack and youre able to find something another guy had a good February hes talented hes really talented out of Clarksville Tennessee like people dont remember this in the class of 2022 he was a top five player in his class yep reclass is up goes to Tennessee doesnt work out there like the natural Talent the body size the athleticism it screams Next Level potential but you have to put it all together to get consider R Taylor cant finish on pain Im going to follow up on that because I have a question about some of these young guys that reclassify and it applies to an old coaching adage theres Hunley Hatfield fouled on the spin Terren tell me now we see a lot of guards reclassify and it works out okay some are exceptional Elliot CAU Tyrese Proctor two guys that have reclassified play well its a little harder I think for big guys isnt it to embrace the physicality sure and hes put on a lot of weight but sometimes Wes like you mentioned Tyrese Proctor and Elliot CAU those guys were older to begin with right so I think they had been I think the right they had reclassed before and then reclassed up like Elliot kaus 19 years old hes hes a freshmans age same with Tyrese Proctor hes a sophomores age they just reclassed up in order to get to where their original class was but the interesting part is the old coaching outages takes longer for Bigs to mature though right yeah because physic if youre asking him to show up a year early like Huntley Hatfield whether his age is right or not its still tough maybe tougher it is it is because you have to embrace the physicality everything inside of 12 ft hurts thats the reason I didnt go in there all that often its a great line heres Bell at the foul line that got blocked and fouled by Johnson thats a mismatch for Tyler Johnson though yeah but thats that was good defense I thought he got up and blocked that shot thats 10 by the way on the vill with 826 to play Two Shots on every common foul Im sorry interrupting you Wes Im still Im still working on my timing with you first time working with you which Im thrilled about by the way but free throw good but coming off a curl I thought Tyler Johnson hes done some nice things defensively forcing turnovers trailing uh Chris Bell whos a terrific shooter I thought he was awfully close to being to being a clean block he just has to learn the point guard position I got 18 for Bell tonight hes good seven in the half n in the half n in the first half well double check that its 19 for Mint 16 for B wow pretty good really good here is white for three look at Taylor rip it away and Justin Taylors built little momentum tonight for a guy who has had a couple non descript games you know just kind of helping the team right 66 sophomore from Charlottesville went to s and bellfield and thatll get us to a timeout 16point game under eight to go

man such Pace never sped up just a really good player and whenever hes operating right here it because hes so good hes always probing the defense slow to fast and then when he gets in transition this was crazy such a good athlete I saw him play for the first time for Team Durant at the Nike Peach jamp and did a lot of those same things you could tell he gets to spots quickly because his steps are so long and whenever the defense is guarding him they can never really relax and you see it last month 19 points a game 19 points tonight on the other end sky Clark just hasnt been able to get loose they have keyed in on what hes done for this Cardinal team yep tough night for Clark Clarks better when the ball moves tough KNE for the bill here is Bell at the line Applause Chris on the first of two is good that gives him now 17 in the ball game he is five for six at the stripe I got it under eight to go and the next one good so Bell and Mintz and the orange back to the Zone largest lead of the night now at 18 for red alri White Pass for Huntley Hatfield and hell score I like that set quick duck in against the Zone have Trey white attack the middle late duck in by Hunley Hatfield he knows what to do eight straight double figure game for huny Huntley Hatfield still a 16point deficit Bell a shot fake and the three rattles in look out now here comes Bell thatll push him over 20 in the ball game hes got 21 to take the scoring lead from minz 40 of the 71 belong to those two guys some really good Shooters in this league would you say he ranks up there towards the top yeah yep I would theres Zan Payne who by the way has only hit two field goals this year and no threes as he missed on that fifth threepoint try of the Year 6 and 1 half to go here at the Y Center this is the last of the seven games on this second to last Saturday of the regular season theres a drive by minz and the rebound for James hell push ahead heres Tyler Johnson driving and blocked by Bell foul on Bell will be his second and the seventh on the arent so free throws coming for the Freshman from Brooklyn all right all other the games are all already final so heres where we are and Ill draw your attention to behind Virginia Clemson Wake and Syracuse so yes a win tonight for the moment would put the orange in fourth now they only have one game left in the regular season and that game is Tuesday night in Clemson PJ Hall senior night its a tough game Johnson has five by the way on the free throw but how about red ay and the move that the orange has made now Terren perception whatever net streak credit ey test quad I dont care leave the quads at home Im sick of talking about the when you put four in a row together five of six and six of eight in February and you do have a win over Carolina and that pitch youre a little bit more than considered arent you one would assume I think red Autreys done a great job in his first year hes still kind of figuring himself out as to what hes going to be as a head coach right they got a lot of help today they did I mean when you think about it Virginia Tech and Notre Dame helped Syracuse today cuz if you get a double buy here you know now granted everythings not been perfect but you are playing well down the stretch which I still think has some matter some yeah right whats amazing to me is this five thats on the floor for Syracuse has played so much yep all this was incidental contact as theyre going to take a look at it sky Clark caught one right in the jaw as mince was driving to the hoop I calling the foul on Mintz which will be his third right that is nine on the orange youll see at the top okay so Mark snner tells us it is an offensive foul on mint didnt look like anything else no Ron gr Jerry heer and were going to stay with what was on the floor nothing at it so no extra add on that thats a nice quick decision yep like it fan of the quick reviews 16point game it is with 6 minutes to go was the last time these two teams met met in Syracuse yeah red autrey was talking about yeah we had three no it was the North Carolina game EXC Im sorry it was a North Carolina game he said yeah we had three reviews at the end of the game took an extra 45 minutes I was ready to get home yeah and it was all Copeland yeah he was he was ready to get home to enjoy the win no kidding and its really kind of the Wind that when you look at the way things have gone it kind of set off the orange heres Hunley Hatfield Clark Baseline nice pass back for Glenn who couldnt finish and were going to get a whistle and a foul and that is Bells third 10 by the way now on uh Syracuse here in this second Music half and thats going to put Caleb Glenn at the line shooting two dont forget tonight at 10 Eastern roughly we hope to be through here in the next few minutes well get Kelsey rggs and by the way we got everybody there tonight full table for The Late Night Buffet ban Boozer Barry Hancock and Kelsey rigs the starting five yeah that is the starting Applause five you know as you look at this and boy does she have her work cut out out for her tonight Mike James the recovery in the score by the way you know if you look ahead to Syracuses team next year if theyre able to hold everybody together man he took a lot of steps didnt he yep got away with IT Crowd thought he traveled so did you heres Clark and well get a foul on Malik Brown trying to reset Huntley Hatfield at the post so Brown has picked up his second Two Shots coming for Brandon Hunley Hatfield Hunley Hatfield telling you talented he he hes made a difference with his effort they doubled him early in the game Syracuse goes 23 hes cutting along the Baseline diving to the Rim Yeah and and then in the break taking off and ceiling low all right by the way I know you said this the first time we worked together I was going to leave all this out but I decided that I wasnt going to let the Forgotten muscle shirt jerseys come back into action tonight this is Young to today and like this was lik by Tyler hansbro by the way your friend its my man yeah little bit more hair back then but not much more all right but the guns the guns were out the guns were out you were jacked oh were really jacked up come on man what are we doing that was jacked up 80 run by the cards here have gotten this thing down to 11 and theres a foul on a Syracuse turnover about say get me off that screen we got a game to watch how about this well Louisville was play jacked up like you were back in your tiger days and that is five fouls on copelan hes done so quader copelan whos had a couple of highlight plays fouls out of the ball game and for copelan itll be the third time hes fouled out in the League this year only 11 minutes of action free throw by Glenn is good with 453 to play Ill tell you this now Ive seen stranger things especially at home just hanging around yep single digits Glenn hit them both now four of six at the line is Caleb Applause Glenn lead to nine with under five to go 10 nothing run the last 90 seconds for the cards Mintz nice pass Brown couldnt finish it James the recovery heres Huntley Hatfield building will be on its feet if they get a three here Terrence certainly will that was terrific helps side defense on The Late rotation Clark skip for James three ball and and Bell in the corner is fouled I Believe by Huntley Hatfield Im going to be honest I I dont think they featured him enough today Hunley Hatfields made quick decisions in the post he got it in the high post swings it out they get a good shot hes focusing on the right things third on Brandon Huntley Hatfield puts Chris Bell at the Applause line Bell is for seven at the strike two shots he had 30 the first time they played got 21 tonight make it 22 he and mint are challenging matchups for Kenny Paynes manto man especially the way he comes off screens on balance thats something thats taught as far as footwork is concerned and Chris Bell I mean really talented individual 23 tonight now for Bell and theres James an easy bucket Mike James now 15 in the ball game on his sixth field goal thats Justin Taylor on that backside of that Wing ball you man and and I know theyre in the zone but youre responsible for that corner have to know where guys are at Min picked up on the dribble flips it to Starling JJ starlings been quiet hadnt he has only seven points or eight points in the ball game five to shoot drives to the basket got to the rim still a ninepoint game after the Miss Clark aob Glenn the catch Bell blocked it what a play by Bell and a foul on Glenn wow fourth on Caleb Glenn gets this to a time out you think youre going to make a run at the end Chris Bell hes been a little bit of everywhere take that one with you Syracuse holding them Music all

speeding down the floor like a speeding bullet golf is all about getting creative and its about knowing how to play the game not how to strike the ball which I think a lot of players are underestimating we are so dedicated to pushing our limit and growing each week for pit the first ever home ACC meet she cant control it the moment is here who will meet it she has the Alli ACC womens basketball tournament first round begins Wednesday at 1 on accn well ninepoint lead for the orange remember they played less than a month ago at the JMA and a goal tending call late in the game gave Syracuse the 9492 win now Bell had 30 min and Sterling had 40 Thats 70 between three cats Terren yeah thatll do it yeah it will thatll do it hey Bill hes done it tonight too an efficient 23 points six and N shooting well they got 42 of the 73 he admits D and when all three get going Starling and and I think its been a pretty quiet night for Starling given that you know he came into the ball game averaging 16 in his last five free throw by Brown good and one more coming another guy justtin Taylor shot 39 from three last year he has not found his rhythm you get all these guys back next year sure and in theory you can see what theyre trying to do two Rim attack guards two Shooters on the perimeter and a big whos a lob threat double double for brown tonight heres a three ball from Applause Clark kisss keep it simple sir get your shooter in the right wing quick ball screen to draw over that second defender in the zone thats target practice for sky Clark Applause Music yep Starling now in a sevenpoint game under three to go fights through up off the glass and in tough shot Seven and the half for Starling 10 in the ball Applause game he is the fourth orange to double figures tonight almost a travel by Clark wasnt it and there goes Glenn offensive foul Caleb Glenn hes fouled out Glenn going to foul out with 14 tonight or check it 15 tonight with 234 to go I love the aggressiveness by Glenn but here Brown is that primary Defender theres some arm there but go about that a little bit differently fourth time this year Glenns fouled out Im surprised thats not higher actually with the manner in which he plays his Applause aggressiveness another good thing too is JJ Starling hits that layup high off the Glass Syracuse is in transition defense really trying to get back hustling because Louisvilles pushing the ball the good thing about when youre playing zone is youre running to an exact spot right so its not one of these things where youre hurrying trying to match up makes it a little bit easier in transition defense two and a half to go in a ninepoint game orange trying to put their fourth straight win on the board here and find fourth place at the end of the night heres Brown foul line Starling off the screen ran into trouble Johnson with the turnover CS pitch it ahead Clark the Applause layup those things that were driving you crazy about Tyler Johnson oh but 10 minutes ago are the things that are spearheading this comeback its a good point quick hands live ball turnovers Kyler Johnson under two to go here goes Min took some contact and a foul crowd here beside itself Music Applause Tyler Johnson on the other end or on this end rather playing defense just pesky pursuing the ball seeing the guy up ahead terrific pass and finish movable just hanging around theyre going to have to stack stops though Clark just fouled out and Min twisted his ankle on that last possession limping his way to the foul line first time that Clark has fouled out of an ACC game his second of the year with 148 to play seven points tonight for Los Angela sophomore Scott Applause Clark and mint is going to go to the line 77 free throw shooter who by my count tonight is four of six Jun is looking for his fourth 20point game or more in League Play there it is Im sorry its his eighth game 20 yeah eighth game of 20 or more Starling has three of 20 or more in conference play and there goes Mintz who earlier tonight was announced on Terrence oglesbys First Team all ACC Squad Im giving it to him yeah well I can see why up nine and under two to go hes been the best player in the building blocked by Taylor Scramble for it and recovered by Starling who made an unbelievable pass they got knocked out of bounds by Taylor itll go to Louisville look at the Block and then the The Fray that then follows might not be the prettiest basketball of the night Justin Taylors a good athlete hes boarded well today done those other things but hasnt shot the ball well this season going take another look at something Im not sure what it is think going look see if it went out of bounds on Taylor but talk to Red arrey about Justin Taylor today as far as like hey he hasnt shot it well yeah so lets try to get him to focus on some of these other things this is a guy who can shoot the basketball hes kind of lost his confidence some of the best ways to get back in the mix is by doing the other things well hes become a better cutter hes done some things around the rim and obviously protecting the rim and rebounding the basketball hes played a nice game despite not really shooting the ball all that much they are checking to see if it was out of bounds on Taylor and you can do this inside of two minutes too so theres the pass oh wow I think its going to belong to Louisville Y in fact it is yeah thats its hard to overturn that my favorite pastime is becoming watching college players start doing the twirling motion with their fingers the entire game thinking that the NBA roles are the same as College roles yeah the college players feel the empowerment to say hey I want yall to look at that right Music yeah hey we got all this technology let me make sure you know that I think you ought to do that Zone by the orange with 13 to shoot heres Johnson Syracuse needs a three here and cant wait around Huntley Hatfield off the GL they havent passed him the ball enough I dont disagree with you I mean hes five of six with 177 points but heres the thing youre seven down with 70 seconds left and youve only got one timeout left minz can go oneonone here hes going to get a brown screen Huntley Hatfield tries to help 11 to shoot heres Starling James has him JJ weave spins and it rims out here are the cards now sevenpoint game three possessions Williams in the corner Mike James a three Applause Music oh and Kenny Payne just used his last timeout with 38 points7 left Im not sure about that one but these teams have been playing close last game same situation battling back but you get a stop you take off and run and you get an open Lo Luke look and Mike James gets it to four well we told you the last time they played early February 9492 was the final looks like we might have another tight fit here is skot Clark he hits a three and then look at this cader copelan going down the floor and it blocked by Caleb Glenn a goal tend is called that gave Syracuse what would be the winning margin I still cant tell if that ball hit the back there and Clarks three for the win at the horn a bit too strong 9492 the final and all of a sudden we bought ourselves a fourpoint game with 38 point9 here to go denight at the Y Center and you waste your last timeout well my thought would be you commit a foul here get Louisville get Syracuse to the free throw line rather than use the last timeout then if you get it to one possession then use your last timeout right yeah and at least be able to try to set your guys up for an offensive possession to get a clean look when you know Syracuse is going to be playing two three for the most part yep so now Louisvilles going to set some pressure but remember in the first at the end of the first half they didnt much of the same thing they got two guys around Min hell have the ball on the inbounds got a foul got a foul I would think so but theres the bounce pass to Taylor and theres the foul they did not want to foul Jud to Min so Justin Taylors going to go to the line the foul is on James and with a fourpoint difference and 314 left Justin Taylor will go to the line where he is 1 for five tonight tonight 75 on the year I guess law of averages yep that gives him three in the half and eight in the ball Music game and he made them both guess what he just did turned it still into a twopossession game 80 to 74 but it requires two threes and heres Tyler Johnson you know hes not going to shoot a three Curtis Williams will and it is too strong and out of bounds itll belong to Syracuse hows that ball not go to Trey white Im with you like how does that ball not get there or Mike James yeah I mean either one heres the inbounds for brown right back to Taylor and a quick foul on white is his fourth hey and Im a Curtis Williams fan Im not trying to take anything away from him I I think hes a hes an okay player thats going to develop into something more here at Louisville but Trey Whites got in his rhythm Mike James just hit a big three youve run some good offense against his own why not a quick ball screen and get somebody in the right 45 and you have an open look Taylors got to hit one to create a third possession and he does thats the biggest news of this free throw situation now it takes three chances for Louisville to have a chance in the final 20 seconds its Tyler Johnson learning the point guard position yep heres white Tyler Johnson for Curtis Williams another three and rebound for Taylor and a foul on Johnson and that will stop the clock with 91 to go and some of the partisans here at the KFC y center head toward the exits on a Saturday night downtown some good restaurants around here Im sure yeah if nothing else they wont be that angry with a belly full of steak which I had one last night which was fantastic Well Done by you uh Syracuse with 91 left to play is staring fourth in the face on the heels of their fourth straight win behind Carolina Duke and Virginia the orange will be 11 and8 and red Als team is going to win four straight and five of six and six of eight Terren theres Johnson that the Cards into the floor his third field goal and into Taylor and up for Mintz and that will be that the orange have beaten the cards for the fourth straight time and for the sixth time in the last seven and in the
