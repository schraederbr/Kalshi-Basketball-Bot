three days at the Tar Heels have welcomed A ranked team into this building but looking for a similar results here tonight lots of great matchups to talk about heading into this one will be really interesting to see how each coach plays it Applause itll be Nance and omir Kip Kissinger gets us going and Miami with the opening possession of the night Applause a terrific offensive team theyre averaging 79 points per game in a new fourgame winning streak Corey they have averaged 86 points per game but they come up empty on their first trip and theyve been doing a lot of that by hot shooting by the guy that gets the first look Nigel pack off the mark on the first one you want to see Armando baycat get a touch just about every time down the floor for the heels absolutely theyve got to play inside out through number five hes got a height advantage on nor Chad OMeara omir is only 67 but tough as Nails itll be Pete Nance from the perimeter missing the three if you mentioned the height Advantage but the strength Advantage may actually go to Vermeer oh look at this Miami team its an experienced group a lot of guys who have been around whether its Rick Miami or elsewhere and a very cohesive unit that Jim larenega has they absolutely do that great chemistry for this team Jim there talk to us about that earlier today foreign Applause gets it into Jordan Miller a little step back jumper wont jump over the rebound down to Caleb love who is coming off what Hubert Davis says is the best game he has played in his three years as a tar heel at winter Clemson on Saturday and then Ive watched cable glove a lot over the fact three years and I agree wholeheartedly with Huber Davis it wasnt only his scoring but his efficiency throughout the game on seven six for nine from three 23 points on the afternoon and he knocks down his first one tonight you have a twoyear Point coach Davis said it wasnt just the efficiency it was the passing the shot selection the defense allround game from Caleb love and the shot selection in my opinion is number one on the party for Caleb love each and every time out tough shot and itll go for willga Poplar a sophomore from Philadelphia this is a high ceiling guys hes not getting as many touches because of the other guys on the team but he feels like a breakout candidate next year he really does and averaging 10 points a game over his last six continues to be aggressive as Caleb left five Armando bake off of the easy block the assist to love the bucket for bacon 52 Carolina early Applause Miami s First Team all Big 12 but Kansas Kansas long could easily be should be first team all ACC this year Miami in the conversation for best backcourt in the ACC with these two guys that guys pretty good too Jordan Miller Jim larranega thinks hes the most underrated player in the country and thats why they may actually be the best backcourt because Jordan Mill is a guard so youre really talking about four guards across the line from Miami theyre starting lineup and we shouldnt be surprised to see maybe Huber Davis downsized get leaky black on him to steal by Isaiah long and Caleb love called for the foul as Wong went up strong to try to finish that and not a popular call from this angle it looked like a lot of basketball by Caleb love and that was a lot of basketball by Caleb love coming in for that blocked shot Applause you say the crowd didnt like it one bit they see it on the scoreboards here at the dean Dome Huber Daviss second year as the head coach of the Tar Heels and of course took it all the way to the NCAA Championship game last year we were up talking to coach Davis in his office before the game hes got a lot of a lot of jerseys from his playing days photos of both his family and moments and one of the most outstanding collection of gameworn shoes you are ever going to see absolutely thats where you were most concerned about it I heard you asked hey coach what size do you wear by the way he like my jacket maybe Ill trade it by Jackie for some shoes everybody would love their jacket today RJ Davis a deep one and Poplar skies for the rebound Miami and Carolina met last year down Coral Gables all hurricanes they won 8557 in that one actual pack misses a shot and then compounds the problem by committing a foul which is not going to be that popular with Jim larenega and laranaga has done very well relatively speaking against Carolina in his time at Miami 710 against the Tar Heels 89 against the Blue Devils those are really good numbers going up against the Blue Bloods they have great numbers and when you concern the fact that he is three and four in this building an opportunity to get to 500 very few coaches can say that especially here good defensive play there by one Applause Miami an elite eight team a year ago as a 10 seed right now Joe Lunardis got him as a 5c they are ranked 15th in the nation and ants a little high low tipped Away by omir Applause Tar Heels making a concerted effort to get Bangkok the ball early and a push on North Shadowmere one of the things youre going to have to watch throughout this game is the battle between Armando baycott and North North may be the strongest player in the ACC talked about moving to Oak tree thats what its kind of like dealing with him on the pole Manson Miss leaky black with a rebound and a putback Carolina back on top you know sometimes you forget hes legit six nine Im not going to go with that all right sometimes you forget Hes listed at six nine there we go I like that much better youre such a skeptic Doppler no tip by omir Millers got it deep in the corner for three and you may as well call that a layup Nigel pack with that much space off of a second chance opportunity hes going to knock that down more times than not Love Waits For the ball screen from Bangkok Carolina moving the ball had a good assist percentage on Saturday against Clemson Davis a little short tipped out by Nance love yes to give the pun but I love the way Caleb has approached this game to start it off weve seen him attacking off the belts finding his teammates weve seen him knocked down to three and then going to the midrange calling his own number in the last possession off to a good start hes got a three and a two five of Carolinas nine in the early going Applause popular Baseline it looked like he kind of lost it in the palm of his hand on the way up to take us to the First Media timeout of the night tied at nine off the court hangout leading to on the court chemistry Corey have you seen it translate so far tonight I absolutely have seen it translates Ray and a lot of it has to do with the sharing of the basketball with this North Carolina team and it starts with Caleb love especially when hes attacking the paint but there wasnt a lot of loves here between Armando baycott and Caleb yesterday simply because Mom knows a Eagles fan and he was letting you know about that earlier yeah we uncovered a little controversy so Bacons a huge Eagles fan I said it looked like love was really getting on you is he a big Chiefs fan or something and bacon said I never heard a mention the Chiefs once until last night we got to give Caleb some love hes from the state of Missouri and of course the Rams left so now he can he can claim the Chiefs he gets a pass speaking of passes one finds Paul Johnson in the corner but Johnson misses the three but still the extra pass getting a great shot instead of a good shot Caleb left for the afternoon hes taking this shot but moving at the cough is what Huber Davis wants to see and of course Jim larenegger always wants to see Isaiah Wong going into his bag how many guys can make baskets in as many different ways as Isaiah walked he is the best tough shot maker maybe in college basketball not just in the ACC DeMarcos done in Off the Bench along with puff Johns from Carolina um they caught up top eight to shoot done baycotts going to have to put up a three with the shot clock running down and itll be Miami ball and right now of course you never mind Armando baycott being the guy that you played through on the perimeter but the short span of time that North adamir was on the bench that would have been one where you would expect it to get the basketball into fives hands with Anthony Walker having the garden 139 in Miami in the early going the Hurricanes again on a fourgame winning streak they have beaten Virginia Tech on the road in Clemson blew out Duke a week ago tonight 8159 and then actually struggled some with Louisville over the weekend were only up one at the half before pulling away a little bit of the second thats been a winning 93 to 85 yeah not really happy about their defensive effort as LL has went off for 33 but still youd rather play not play well in the loss than play well and lose game so coming up later on tonight after our game into the Big 12 we go to Lubbock itll be number six Texas taking on Texas Tech the Longhorns one game up on top of the Big 12 ahead of Kansas and Baylor you can see that game at nine Eastern on ESPN and streaming on the end Angelique Joseph in Off the Bench for Miami misses the elbow jumper Applause love into some traffic forces it up but he does draw the foul and this is when Caleb love is at his absolute best when hes getting downhill putting pressure on the defense attacking the rim because he is a very capable passive so it doesnt always have to be for his own offense oftentimes he finds his teammates with great looks and that foul was assessed on nor Chad omear hes acting like no that wasnt on me that shouldnt have been called on me if its on him its his second and it looks like its on him and hes probably going to be coming out and that is a major loss so heres some playing as well as any big guy in the conference reason he absolutely has and you see Jim larenaga not happy about that call also not happy about the fact that North Adam put himself in that position and again a young man who is still learning of course with Nicaragua the person college basketball players also college basketball player from Nicaragua Music so the biggest guy Miamis got on the floor right now is Anthony Walker 6915 but Armando baycat just went for the bench for Carolina The Freshman Jalen Washington is in for the heels wow a little bit too strong and look at the elevation there by Miller for the rebound Scoops it up and in and a chance for an and one a young man who Jim larenegger refers to as the most underrated player in America Jordan Miller continues to be productive in this time on the floor coming up with the offensive rebound and then patience allows him to spin the righthand layup the finish and an opportunity for the hand one hes been in double figures in 19 consecutive games Applause hes well on his way again hes already got seven here in the first eight minutes of this one boy thats some speed both by love offensively and Joseph defensively Johnson Baseline it wont stay down and Miller down with a rebound indecision Dan he was caught between whether he should dunk it or Lay It Up Walker in and out rebound leaky lack Applause love pulls up inside the arc and left it short tipped by black into the hands of Johnson and this time hell finish foreign Music Applause a bit fired up Carolina back within four Juan curls gets inside has it altered and its Carolina Ball numbers Applause and a missed three by Gunn Miami ball as we go to break Music 1612 Keynes up on the heel carrying the basketball on Saturday against Clemson he talked about how his team was playing with a great sense of Joy he talked about how much fun they were having and a lot of it was because they were sharing the basketball making the next pass making the right play but when you play that way often things oftentimes things go well for you Caleb love making the right play getting out of transition finding DeMarco done although the shot does not go down it builds for later Applause Miller trying to back down puff Johnson turn around Fade Away not there the rebound to RJ Davis Applause Music thats one of the things that you often see from North Carolina they first after mates and misses a staple of this program and again even though theyre not a great shooting team still always at the top of the ACC score just one for eight from threepoint range tonight not a good threepoint shooting team of the season the heels 314 second to last in the ACC they caught back in for Carolina hes got a major size advantage on Anthony Walker with omir on the bench pulled up by love is good hes got eight Court hes got eight of the 14 and hes been so under control and hes the one whos not scoring he has the one assist with North Carolina throughout this first half but in two but not for long as they find Miller on the battle Jordan hes got nine thats one of the areas of concern when youre playing against Miami all Five Guys on the floor are capable of scoring at any given time so you cant just key on one guy when you talk about a team that always willingly shares the basketball the hurricanes are that Davis nice little hesitation in for his first points of the night Applause Everly off to Walker driving on Bay conda but he shuffled his feet Applause Music havent talked much about Armando Bangkok on the offensive end of the floor of course comes in averaging 176 only two points tonight but theyre helping so much its going to open up opportunities for other players in North Carolina can make sure they dont have Tunnel Vision on Bangkok trying to get into basketball when other guys are open hes averaging better than 17 a game third in the ACC on the season I love a miss here and its down to Harlan Beverly Applause puts it up too strong and black the rebound Applause Applause and that moved by the fifth year senior has got him on their feet here with the dean Dome boy you got to do a good job to stay in front of Nigel and Caleb love did a good job staying in front of him now Davis in transition love from the wing rebound Miller another great look in transition North Carolinas gotten a number of goals throughout the day in the three Cuba Davis youd like those shots even though its not a great threepoint shooting team Applause foreign yes and Miami back on top as thatll quiet the crowd Leslie Joseph only shooting about 27 from Beyond threepoint range in ACC play but a much better shooter than his number suggests in showing the off right there in the last possession very strong defensive guard as well Davis five pack Scoops it up and ends foreign Applause Music Applause Music Applause Music as far as offensively but Im not sure thats the side he won the seat from besley Joseph at that moment now reach around foul called on Walker whos got his hands full trying to deal with a big cot down low Applause good game here at the dean Dome Roy Williams Court of the Deanie Smith Center and oh boy hes feeling it tonight Cory well I got the swag surf going okay oh Roy living his best life today taking on his hometown to Philadelphia yeah well what a good game it was last night right down to the wire oh and Manson baycott can connect Carolina turnover Applause Music for Miami nor Chad omear remains on the bench picked up two fouls about seven eight minutes in now AJ Casey a 69 freshman from Chicago was in at the five spot if you will for the hurricanes and thats him battling for the ball but he loses the battle so it looks like Jim larenega is going to try to get to halftime without bringing omir back in again a little love again and then I believe thats the best move when you look at the conversation between omir and laronega on the way out of the game after getting their second foul you can tell that Jim lehrenegger may not trust omir to not get that third here in the first half the double figures for Carolina now with 10 little shot fake the kick from back and a corner three not there for Poplar out of bounds to the heels Applause ACC Big 12 super Tuesday doubleheader starting in the ACC just down the road in Durham the Irish are there take on the Blue Devils and the number five Kansas is in Stillwater but the Cowboys just about beat Kansas at the fog a few weeks ago nice doubleheader tomorrow night on ESPN and streaming on the app also Mike gray making the return to where he started his fathers ocean career as Armando baycott gets his second field goal to go but go back to Mike gray in his last season Notre Dame was assistant coach for Coach K he had Duke three years ago Carolina now 10 out of 13 from twopoint range just one out of 10 from threepoint range one good defense by leaky black out of bounds still Miami ball thats almost like saying the sky is blue good defense from Ricky black you talk about one of the best defenders in the college basketball game and you like him on Isaiah 1 I love him guarding Isaiah long again Isaiah Wong is the best offensive player for Miami you put your best defender on lays it in and Miami back within one boy between Pat and Juan theyve got two gifted scorers in the backboard they absolutely do and again when you put leaky black on one of those guys the other ones going to look to take advantage Cuba Davis told us early he wish he could chop leaky up and play it first of all five guys they got the kick Music inside 10 to shoot Davis drives soft off the glass I believe RJ Davis has dropped to the Corey Alexander School of Defense which is my offense is my best defense another underrated guy averaging over normal points per game along with a shot fake steps in and buries her boy thats pretty it really is and again you have to honor his ability to stretch it from Beyond the threepoint leaky black line after helping out along with a smart decision to go to the midbrain back and forth we go here at the dean Dome Love Somehow finds his way to the rim and hes got a dozen again weve seen North Carolinas guards find their way to the rims relatively easily against this Miami defense rejected by Nance false solution it belongs to the heels Applause selected and stolen by packing it back come the canes Miller for three well you gotta like the pace but you love the pace but you also love the Poise from Miami with everything going against them they never get rounded Miller good job by Nance to stay in front of him but then pack knocks down a three to tie it up hes got eight and think about that thats a fivepoint swing North Carolina was on a fast break for the opportunity to score a layup Nigel pack comes up with the steal and then the three on the other end Ill tell you you got to be in good shape playing this one tonight terrific Pace long stretches without a whistle the Deep position by Bangkok and a foul going against Miami weve got great bigs in this game but were going to talk about the guards RJ Davis attacking the bucket with the easy finish however Isaiah Wong the pullup the midrange is true and weve got a great guard match up coming up on the Jeep halftime report we lean into the ACC talk some surprise teams also a pair of sublime matchups in the Big 12 to look ahead to looking at this one though finds punch counter punch its been good what are you seeing yeah I love the Poise that Caleb love is playing with Im often critical of him because hes such a talented player and sometimes he forces himself on the game hes not Seth hes making great decisions with the basketball and taking terrific shots hes got 12 in the first half its rough hanging out with two Notre Dame guys Ill tell you what I look at the space in that Miami plays with Corey Alexander you would be good in that Miami system coach I would have loved to play for Jim larenagan I know you guys go way back from your days of being on the same staff at University of Virginia under Terry Holland but coach larenegger talked to us today about the fact that he doesnt live at his barge especially he allows his guys to go out and have freedom because thats the way he wanted to play when he was a player at Providence College lets be honest he made your day I asked him about that the freedom and he goes I played and then he looked at you and he said you know and you were so happy when he brought you in on the conversation well that was only the recovery when his wife said if she mutes me when she sees me on TV you cant win them all Applause the Corey Alexander Andrea Carter here in Chapel Hill Beverly no followed by Miller now and man stab with a rebound Caleb love on the bench for the first time tonight Seth Trimble is coming to the game for Carolina Bayside switch the defense and lays it in and he worked so hard to get position and youve got to give him on to make a lot of credit when hes even when hes not getting the basketball hes constantly working to put himself in a position to get the ball in his hands to help his team and taking advantage of the fact that omir has been on the bench for a while with two fouls you have to be happy about the fact that where you are without omir Walker no Trimble the rebound Applause symbol the crossover all the way and Wong down with a rebound Miami looking to push boy thats a sweet little pass in traffic from Wong into Walker and theyre going to get the end one its going to be a foul and opportunity to tie this game for Anthony Walker theres a late foul but at the same time really on unnecessary with the beautiful fine by Isaiah long and the patients the boys once again Mars talked about it Applause just dropping it off to Walker and I believe theyre going to get leaky black for that foul its going to be a wasting one on me foreign Applause lead black NAB of the bench two minutes to go in the first half freshman from Harrisonburg Virginia number 24 in the beginning for Carolina for the first time spin by bacon follow no basket no basket fouled before the tipin by bacock theyll get Walker for the foul his second Applause how hard he works and this time spinning misses really what would have been an easy layup but I believe Isaiah Wong may have gotten his hand on the basketball blocked shot there but baycott continues to pursue it on the offensive glass Music Applause true in the Gap how about this matchup out of the SEC number one Alabama number 10 Tennessee from Knoxville I just saw Alabama in person down in Auburn on the weekend boy are they good in playing at a high level right now they are the number one ranked team in the nation right now you drop from one to three after hits loss to Northwestern over the weekend got Brandon Miller playing great basketball for Alabama I mean again it doesnt get any better and it doesnt get any better than Isaiah Wong and what he does we talked about him continue to make tough shots every game of force breaks out Ill take him tied at 32 we would see you look at North Carolina offensively and everyone is trying to get the basketball to Bangkok but other guys are open when he can draw so much attention and the spin and again foreign continues to look on Applause I mean as you said thats a layup heels on the logo no problem youre talking about a 42 career threepoint spill goes shooter this dude is Elite from Beyond the arm Applause Davis the kid Nickel in the corner rebounces on the rim before it falls off and now Miami can effectively hold for the final shot of the half Jim laronega is going to use the timeout we are back in 30 good one here in Chapel Hill the cage with a ball and a onepoint lead Music Applause oh were firing up the Chewie app cant say no to these prices hmm clumping litter resounding yes salmon pate love that for me Essentials check oh we have enough to splurge on catnip toys we did it I feel so accomplished pet me please okay thats enough now back to me time love you great prices Happy Pets chewy post game good game here with the dean Dome dance show but Corey Alexander Andrea Carter Carolina right now Joe linardis got him as an 11 seed in but not safe they need a big win this would be a nice win if they can find a way to pull it they absolutely do and theyre 111 on their home court they only lost to Pittsburgh here and a great opportunity to be able to get it theyre not the same team on the road so whenever they have an opportunity to get a big win here in the Dean Smith Center they have to take advantage of it and uhoh for Carolina Armando baycott walking to the locker room walking by Roy Williams and everybody else will try to get you an update on that Miami of course theyre having another very strong season 20 and five ranked 15 Joe linardis got him as a five seed right now they have really put together some quality wins this year Music difference between the game clock and the shot clock foreign Music run off the clock and we could see another one of those coming theres a smart play however if youre Huber Davis you may want to substitute if youre going to waste fouls like that those fouls could be valuable for RJ Davis later in this game now September will go over and guard Nigel pack expecting for him to be the guy with the basketball on his hand and itll be puff Johnson to give the foul but only four tenths of a second came off the clock so that uses up Jordan Miller take a little exception to that foul by puff Johnson Applause and its got to be a quite a bit Jordan Miller of course one of the guys you talk about his personalities hes one of the best not really sure it wasnt a lot there to me Miller fell down Carolina with a steal and one knocked it away what a defensive play by Isaiah 1 denying Trimble in his effort to lay it in and itll be Miami walking to the locker room with a onepoint lead at halftime here on the road great play by Isaiah wall getting back its the second time weve seen that she didnt score no rebounds so they are looking for big minutes from him in the second half lets go to Dre things damn well I caught up with Coach Hubert Davis coming out of halftime he said the biggest issue in the first half was the 11 Second Chance points allowed he said were the number one defensive rebounding team in the conference that cant happen I also asked him about the big threes canceling each other out in that first half with nor Chad omear coming back from Miami he said someone has to step up for North Carolina as well and Armando bacon try to go right at omir on their first possession but thats like running into a brick wall and bacon lost the ball it really is and thats one of the reasons why Jim Barnegat was so upset about getting that last foul because it wasnt one that he really earned but we see Jordan Miller continuing to be successful when he gets to basketball in his hand hes got 11 now into double figures for the 20th consecutive game yeah love had a nice first half for Carolina pitch and then omir gets back to defend bacon Davis has to force it up and its well short Miller in transition lays it in again and what a nice start in the second half for Miami Applause yourself with the Carolina responses here baycott getting down to the post omir follows him and we got a block on with the Poplar uh Dre you got an update on baycott yeah Dan just something to keep an eye on you all saw Armando baycott go into halftime a little earlier than the rest of the team I was told that his back was a little tight so they were working on his back at halftime was also told that he should be good to go but especially going against North Shadow Mirror and all that strength Corey that you talked about keep an eye on how Armandos moving absolutely Dre that was the first thing he did not thought of when you said back and having to deal with omir on the Block could be a challenge now baycott is grimacing and shaking his left wrist as he gets back down the court on defense you got a feel for the guy you know well documented ankle injuries had a shoulder injury earlier this year had a thumb injury in the Miami game last year got places much and plays as hard as anybody but unfortunately for him it always seemed not always it often seems like hes dealing with something well you know as a guard I often have a bunch of friends in the in the game who played what theyd like to call in the trenches and they tell me I wasnt Tough Enough playing The Trenches black showing that hes worn tough enough to get into the trenches and get a bucket for the heels Applause needed bucket for the heels black now with six threepoint lead Keynes Isaiah Wong again putting some size on Wong Wong into omear and omir stopped for Miami doing a nice job though getting back in transition love into the paint and he draws the foul Applause Armando baycott continues to battle on the offensive glass but you see his left wrist lower arm getting caught up with George had omir weve talked about how strong omir is and you see these two guys matched up beside each other bacon absolutely has the height Advantage but when it comes to strength Im not sure theres anyone in the ACC stronger than North tatomir and of course having a conversation between the two but difficult to officiate both of these players thank you Applause one point game four one here for Carolina and the fans getting louder with a Dean goal Miller got the switch Miller driving on bacon spins back to his left and is found here so he got back to his strong side Music foreign Applause Music Applause Music Applause Music Applause Music lets take a look at some former McDonalds allamericans come on to bake out in 2019 RJ Davis 2020 Caleb aloud as well how about that Carolina with 80 McDonalds since 1977 and Ive been fortunate enough to call the McDonalds AllAmerican Game for the past six seasons but we actually havent had once okay LeBron RJ Davis did not have an opportunity to play in a McDonalds AllAmerica Game you can go to a McDonalds allamericans Armando bacon told Anthony and that crew the last McDonalds AllAmerican Game which will be back late March in Houston Texas this year boy love had a good look hes now hes four for five from twopoint range tonight just one for six from threepoint range went off the game against Clemson Saturday in which he knocked down six three points doesnt need a lot of space doesnt need a lot of time and you know when you look at the two transfers for Miami they complement each other so well because Nigel pack is so great at shooting off screens and I dont think anyone sets better screens for 10 North Shadowmere Applause mans travel bro hes having a tough time getting going Nance has not scored tonight he is over three from the field Saturday against Clemson oh for seven from the field in 19 minutes of action and he is a good shooter he is just in a bit of a rut right now he really is at one phase we talked with Huber Davis about pregame was going with a smaller lineup Buck Johnson coming in and playing that three four three four position moving Ricky black down and buff now at the scores table ready to check in everybody think he was going to Dish it or go left and he wound up with an uncontested layup and its the biggest lead of the night for the hurricanes Music and hell draw the foul but a good start in the second half here for Miami they were up one at halftime theyre now up and eight on the news not that he ever took Corey we pay homage to those guys in their focus their stick to it attitude so we say thank you and also North Carolina says thank you to Mr Willie Cooper because his daughter Tanya played for the North Carolina team that won the National Championship in 1994 wow thats big time right there and of course you whenever you think North Carolina basketball you also think about Charles Scott the first black player to ever play varsity basketball and you know you go back and you look at the stories and talk to Charles Scott about the fact that Dean Smith took him to church on his recruiting visit and thats what won him over there unpopular call here at the dean domes speaking of Dean Smith here at the Dean Thomas Armando baycod is called for the foul his second Music Applause not only does it mind the contact he seeks out the contest and Im sure this they match up that OMeara was looking forward to when you go up against Armando baycott who really is the standard for post players in the ACC and now an opportunity to stay on the floor a little longer heres the second half and youre a transfer from Arkansas State the Sun Belt Player of the Year and defensive player of the year a season ago Miller defended by Tuff Johnson cant finish the reverse and its Carolina ball you know one of the things that you and I both will appreciate then your channel was a baseball player in his early life in Nicaragua of course growing to 67 and massive we dont even know what the number is as far as the win but transitioning over to the basketball court and maybe he winds up as an NFL tight end in a few years he can do that just cover all three Sports Poplar another Miami player also played a lot of baseball growing up boy good health there by omir and he recovers well sorry shot clock at five black has to get off a tough shot and down with the rebound is omir small thing right there the Leaky black actually got Beverly in the air hes gone and we talked about it before the game hes got a lot of Jordan Millers got a lot of tools in the toolbox he can hurt you a lot of different ways and hes got great footwork in the painted area again hes not the athlete thats going to jump over top of people so he goes around guys and Maneuvers around six nine long lefthanded I can hand it out about a six nines to six numbers for Miami and what a defensive play by Davis of the stable the Keynes with a great hustle to prevent a layout this great Hustle by RJ Davis also a great Hustle by Jordan Miller running the floor great hands to catch it and then recognizing hes going to go up and under and not in the conventional sense but using a great footwork to get a bucket Music rejected from behind by Bangkok Davis in transition 4840 Miami Cod who turned his back on him it looked like but gets called for the foul is third but its the right call Dan and the reason being if youre going to be in the restricted area to defend a shot you have to jump so as Armando baycott turns his back he pretty much gives Nigel pack the opportunity to create the contact and get the and get the free throw obviously theres no legal guarding position there for Armando baycod and then again if that play happen outside of the restricted area theres probably no call but in that how large the diameter is it is going to be a foul if you dont leave the floor so pack at the line First Team all Big 12 a year ago with Kansas State put 35 points up on The Jayhawks 32i was staying and earlier this year against Virginia Tech scored 17 points in five minutes and eight seconds I was watching that game live and when I tell you when very few guys can get hot in the way Nigel back can get hot and he can shoot as they step across half court Jim Miller and Angus said the best thing of all you know omir joins the team pack joins the team theyve become like best friends pack and Isaiah Wong hit it off right away just a real selflessness and camaraderie on this Miami team Applause thank you Beverly triner Corral it finds back and he lays it in Music Nigel back now with 24 and a great play by Harlem Bagley getting back as Bud Johnson lines up the three unable to finish it but that camaraderie and the chemistry you talked about with Miami you got to give the young guys and new guys a lot of credit but more credit goes to the returning players who welcome these guys with open horns especially after being the lead a team last year lost some good players cam Augustus Sam wardenberg Hubert Davis is not happy probably not happy with the way his team is playing right now probably not happy with the whistle a little bit right now is evidence of that and Miami has stretched out a onepoint lead at the break to a 12 point lead now on the strength of a 132 run let me give you Carolina stat theyre shooting 70 from two point Rings tonight and seven percent one for 15 from threepointers and especially when you consider coming off a game where they made 15 threepointers on the season High 33 attempts just two days ago and an offensive foul nor Chad omear and the signal from Paul sells one of the officials is that he grabbed the jersey of Armando baycott thatll be the third on omear see over here trying to get that post position hard to see from that angle it must have been with the left hand that he grabbed the Jersey what does Carolina have to do to get going again well one of the things theyve got to be able to do is get the basketball in the hands of bacon especially now with OMeara on the bench Armando bacon has to be more of a force inside with Anthony Walker having to defend them he has not attempted a shot here in the second half hes four for five on the night just as he was at halftime and they got him for the offensive foul two officials simultaneously blowing the whistle and making the call and baycott headed immediately to the bench thats going to be his fourth foul so you see the action here as baycott drops that left shoulder Anthony Walker never moves so makes him in legal guarding position absorbed to contact they turn over and with 12 minutes remaining bacon having to take a seat Music rebound Music alone misses the three in the rebound down to Beverly and I believe the cave of Love is going to have to be more aggressive at this point but I dont think its going to be shooting the three I think hes going to have to find a way to get downhill get to the basket find this teammates because right now Miami is finding their way to the Rim Yeah its going well for the canes in the second half welcome back to Chapel Hill lets take a look at an upcoming Sonic Blockbuster itll come to you at four oclock Eastern three Central Lawrence Kansas another big time matchup of the Big 12 number nine Baylor they have really turned it around after a bit of a valley early run in the season and KU is fifth in the nation Jalen Wilson likely first team AllAmerican I would think averaging better than 20 points per game cannot wait to get to Lawrence for that one on Saturday okay so now Im gonna put you on the spot oh you have done games in all the big Arenas in the right places the most exciting atmosphere to do a game in college basketball with the Kansas yeah we talked earlier and I didnt ask you the question and I won the way to put you on the spot yeah appreciate it knocks down of three and a necessary shot Nikki black turned down a three earlier when hes wide open on the opposite side hes going to have to take those shots to keep the defense on him now let me tell you in an interest to still have friends around the country Duke is great Indianas great Purdue is great on and on theres so many great plays what about you uh I would have to say the toughest place the loudest Arena that Ive heard is Anthony Walker steps up and knocks down the jumper the loudest Arena that Ive heard calling a game is when the University of Virginia visits Virginia Tech you and I did that game last year absolutely 100 the loudest place Ive been in years and they get Rowdy in the castle you know of course Virginia has a great atmosphere Ill tell you being down at Auburn already that place is its a perfect size its great lets bring in Drake Corey Im just curious you mentioned the place thats the loudest when youre calling a game but lets go back I dont know how many years but back when you played loudest toughest place to play what was it it absolutely by far Cameron Indoor Stadium it wasnt even close and way back then you know in the stone ages as you like with a necessary bucket right now but the difference is but then North Carolina unable to get stops and thats been the biggest difference they were great defensively against Clemson Miami having no parts of that and again theyre going to have to do it for a while without Armando Baytown if youre just joining us he is on the bench with four fouls and this one going against Miami a little momentum shift here in the last couple of minutes inside the ding Dome Music you know it back to Dres question talking about atmospheres did you get an opportunity at all on Sunday yesterday to see the South Carolina atmosphere with LSU coming in both teams undefeated to start that game yes I did just a little in the first half I did yes oh my guys I I had South Carolina we had game day when Tennessee was in the house another sold out crowd it gets loud in colonial Library like this it gets loud like this Applause getting pretty loud here right now my friends again though this is an experienced poised Miami team and look at that backwards with a rejection on Beverly Davis tip no good and its Miami Ball but not for long Jim larenega incensed and he just called a timeout he is not happy Music of course as youre learning this game growing up there are a number of cardinal sins in the game of basketball and one of them is you never save the ball underneath your opponents basket that time Harlan Beverly saving it under North Carolinas basket and an assist to Leaky black whose bucket makes a single digit game as North Carolinas on a 70 run thank you black having a nice game 11 points eight rebounds Carolina back within nine and again out of the timeout still no bake God got four fouls Davis cant get the shot off three on the shot clock love rebound down to Miller Miami running oh and a bucket for Jordan Miller continues to have a great night and hes going to the line looking for his 20th point Im gonna go as far as to say this may be the slowest transition offense and slowest transition defense Ive seen in a very long time Jordan Miller really playing oneonone with RJ Davis and with the size Advantage just gets to a spot and is able to finish through the contract so you dont call that it looks like a slow break were gonna do a slow break on that Music Miller with 20 packed with 20 two of them combining for 40 of Miamis 59 and even without wall and OMeara having big games which you would expect from his Miami team theyre still able to compete because they can just scoring your production from so many different players pop Johnson elevating for the rebound Music omir cannot handle it and the Hurricanes will be right back to the heels well Thursday night the 19th ranked Tar Heel women swear on a rivalry game against NC State eight oclock Eastern on the ACC Network this will be the second game of a womens basketball doubleheader Syracuse and Florida State getting it started at six Eastern and let me tell you Reynolds Coliseum will be rocking when the Tar Heels come into that building Johnson will try another one Carolina still struggling they are now two for 21 from threepoint range Huber Davis told us this is not making 15 threes thats not who they are but yet 21 attempts throughout this game many of those oftentimes you could have gone to the paint tried to get something different a twopoint line they are 306th in the nation of a 363 division one teams and three point black down with a rebound Applause Music foreign Music ball is the call and the possession arrow is going to give it to Miami so that little run Carolina was on shooting Carolina just two for 22 and Isaiah Wong quiet night by his standards nor Chad omear quiet night by his standards but Jordan Miller and Nigel packs making a lot of noise yeah and the reason why its been a quiet night for Isaiah long is because he they had the best defender in the ACC guarding him and leaky black who held Hunter Tyson till one of two from the field on Saturday youre talking about possibly first team allagency performer Ricky black for 30 took him out of the game but the difference for Miami theyve had other guys step up black also did a great job on Brandon Miller its also the first team AllAmerican Alabamas outstanding freshman that was back in November Vermeer short on the jumper but he got it back and missed on the foul and its been that type of night for omir just has his name to get going missing most of the first half with bow trouble unable to find any rhythm on the offensive interfere Carolina which is 47 points and again just two for 22 threepoint range Davis will try one not there Davis gets it back and knocks it down Applause 10point game just over six minutes to go but as we were talking about during the break its tough to knock Miami off their game theyre again theyre experienced theyre a cohesive unit they just keep doing what they do and the reason is because they have great dog play when you look at Isaiah wall who of course as us talk him up gets a turnover but when you look at what they have on the floor right now besley Joseph would be a starter on most teams in the ACC but right now he comes off the bench great ball handler because Nigel pack is such a dynamic player and when youve got Jordan Miller really as that fourth yard youre going to be better than most teams especially in late game situations love puts the brakes on black spins into the paint gets doubled and kicks it out trying to take it advantage to his Blacks height advantage on Juan instead a foulomb Applause Music a chance to go to the line got off to a great start tonight steam points on the night coming up next in the second game of our doubleheader well send you to Lubbock itll be number six Texas the leaders in the Big 12 taking on the Red Raiders nine oclock Eastern Eastern and streaming live on the app Dan do you remember not so long ago when Kansas won the Big 12 every year and of course a lot of coaching changes a lot of program changes in the Big 12 and now its hard for me to say it but they didnt they have taken over as the best conference in the country its hard for me to say that but right now the Big 12 is loaded with quality basketball it sure is they could get as many as eight out of the Ten teams into the NCAA tournament Miller into Amir remember baytowns got four OMeara right into his chest and scores with the left hand for your channel but similar to what bacon was trying to do to Amir earlier knowing he was in foul trouble oh man trying to do the same thing to see if he can pick up that fifth on Bangkok Nance turn around and it goes and the first points of the night for Pete Nance Applause all right nothing to rush Applause Music gets out of the trout and the wing three is there for Jordan Miller having himself one heck of a night hes now got 23 he has done it all tonight for Miami and more importantly when they need it in most are at the other end for Carolina timeout taken by Huber Davis back down to single digits 407 to go here in Chapel Hill attorney to get to know chiante George a bit a year ago at the McDonalds AllAmerican Game of course watched him coming up and he has blossomed into a great player for Scott green down to Baylor a turnover by long here how did timeout could be a big momentum shift in North Carolina inside four minutes to go Carolina down by nine to Miami Applause love to the Baseline floats it up short rebound omir you see why I hate floating Im still trying to figure out the difference between the floater and the runner I always get that wrong and Im sitting will we have more time and as the teardrop a whole different thing wash over by Wong Poplar steps in and its an 11 point lead now for the hurricanes Applause over with a very popular shot Music loving the fact that he went to the midrange in comparison to Uncle penetrating Davis knocks down another three its down to eight but North Carolinas got to find a way to get stops on this end of the floor this is where Miami has been so successful Premier gives it up to Poplar lots of time Music now 72 oh mayor blocked Miami ball with 22 on the shot clock but theres one team that I know is prepared for this scenario it would be the Miami Hurricane Jim Linda has a book of plays for this mustang long in the corner short topper with a rebound and Apollo huge play for Poplar in the Hurricanes its all about the details Huber Davis has talked about an allseason long day in the details and that was not dotting the eyes crossing the tees finishing the defensive play no reason for RJ Davis to get out and try to defend that he cant help that but what he does allow with a popular opportunity to pick up the second chance opportunity and now the threepoint play or just a huge play back to an 11 point lead and time definitely a factor now Applause black tipped by Bangkok gathered by Bay caught in finished by big one of the most unbelievable stats that you will see in this game tonight only the third rebound o victims 31 minutes on the court the accs leading rebound a nice play defensively by Luke Bryan Applause nowhere to go love in the corner mans the rebound and deflected out of bounds still Carolina ball a minute 36 to go Music foreign Applause Music love to inbound with 18 on the shot clock Music and its a seven point game smart play by leaky black attacking the basket not settling for the three putting two points on the board Applause 13 now for leaky black a minute 29 to go and its down to seven Applause come on they get a win this game far from over you look at a minute and 29 remaining but Miami is so poised under pressure and you get an opportunity to look at Joey brackets seedings right now for the ACC North Carolina at an 11 seed and again one of the last four buys right now and lost heel in that hardcore to put them into pretty much the playing round long to inbound Miami with a lot of experience quality ball handlers on the court Miller gets it over now theyll use a little bit of fun Music trying to turn the corner and turns it over and in a burden tripped there by omir is going to send Davis to the freethrow line perfectly executed defensive Trap by North Carolina give winky black Armando bake got a tremendous amount of credit bay cost slim his feet without fouling cutting off Nigel pack and allowing leaky black to get back into this is a big trap even though leakys not six nine he is six seven and thats a big trap RJ Davis with great anticipation to come up with the Steal and the conferences leading free throw shooter was at the line Applause Applause down to five 110 remaining a tremendous amount of time five point game and weve seen Miami lose a couple games down the stretch this season where they havent handled the late game situations very well right now North Carolina picking it up defensively we will see that trap once again for from Hubert Davis and his team when they step back on the court a 60 run for the Tar Heels over the last 59 seconds Music now we take a look at the Capital One a rewarding performance and Jordan Miller has had it going on in a lot of different ways all night long you got to love the footwork and you got to love the way he can score with both the left and the right absolutely and you may say that his biggest basket of the night was this threepoint field goal knocking it down on that left wing when North Carolina was making it run Jordan Miller stepping up and making big plays for the Kings 23 to lead the way for Miami Nigel pack has 20 but Miami not in the clear yet with a minute 10 to go and Carolinas cut it from 11 down to five Music Applause actually pressure coming here from the heels Music long to inbound in good size on the ball for Carolina with leaky black Music Applause heres the Trap Juan to omir is going to dribble it over and love will foul him to send omir to the line Music omir is 70 freethrow shoot around the season Miami has a team very good freethrow shooting team 77 of the season one and one for omir as nickel comes in for offense Trimble who was in there for defense sits down Applause as you mentioned the first ever player from Nicaragua to be a Division one mens scholarship basketball player has fit in perfectly at the U big free throw here Applause one of two still a two possession game with a minute to go off the fingertips of love and out of bounds back to the hurricanes now believe the officials would go well no not going to take a look at this as uh the great call Caleb love gets that last Wugga popular does a great job of getting over deflecting the basketball looks like the coaching staff for Carolina is asking Kip Kissinger to have a look at it were speculating a little bit right now but they the officials seem very confident that it is Miami ball well you would want that as a coach of your Cuba Davis to give you opportunity to draw up something especially defensively and how you want your team to execute thank you back to omir and again the foul to send omir back to the line and thats the right guy thats number ten so its two shots now but Carolina executing perfectly right now and of course you know this is where extending the game first begins Dean Smith was the coach that learned how to make it last minute of a game go on for a half hour you know its Huber Davis of course a disciple of Dean Smith doing that very well right now and getting the right guy North adamir at the line but omir right now making two of his last three free throws well it says something about Miami that the right guy to put it the line from the Carolina perspective is a 70 free throw shooter thats very true when he goes up and knocks down both of them the other four guys are all even better than that boy what a what a benefit it is to his team when everybody can shoot free throws Music Applause races it over the timeline and black reaches it and fouls him and pack will shoot a couple thats not the guy you want to send to the freezer 86 and he is as calm as you get especially at these at this phase of the game getting to the free throw line you see leaky black were right in front of this it looked like a lot of basketball on this reach and whats on the replay it also looks like a lot of basketball but leaky black and not arguing it so Ill go with it being the right ball Music thank you Applause I will take no responsibility for that by the way even though the truck is spreading responsibility Applause one or two and its back to seven whoa whoa from Way Beyond the yard to make a fourpoint game with 349 to go it is what he does cable love can have a game where he is shooting terribly from three he is two for 11 from the game one of ten before that shot but he steps up and makes big shots for this team at all times in the NBA they keep clutch time points they dont do it in college basketball Caleb love is a 36 percent shooter in all other times but in clutch time I believe he has to be closer to 50 he makes these shots constantly Carolina 202 When Love scores 20 or more he is at 20 right now but they are still down by four with 349 to go that was also the last time out for Huber Davis Music one of the things right now Huber Davis has to be cognizant of is knowing whos on the floor and how many fouls they have at this point we know baycott has four but love Davis and linky black all with three fouls as well you may want to take those guys out of the game because if youre fortunate enough to be able to push this to overtime you dont want to have to play without one of those guys so right now with the pressure you can see if you can come away with the steal and more importantly you foul get your guys back in the game Music so Miami trying to go to 12 and 4 in League Play stand their winning streak to five Applause Music Applause and Carolina trying to pull off what would be an impressive comeback considering they were down 14 not that long ago they have done a nice job extending this game still against them near Miami ball up by four with 349 to go Applause again a Wong to inbound to the hurricanes in the pack and pack will be going back to the line Applause Music and again if youre Jim larenega even though he missed one of the two moments ago you are youre good with this youre absolutely good with this this is the guy that you want to have at the free throw line at this time of the game you think about this as Nigel Packs third year of college basketball hes been here so many times hes talking about all Big 12 performer a year ago people out Applause and Trimble out nickel back in wait what a spot imagine if like the final shot of the game came down to a guy whos barely played just kind of been subbing out in and out of possession here a possession there imagine if the ball winds up in his hands Tyler Nichol hes from the back I trust him 2909 points Virginia High School record hes made Davis has made some big shots not this time long down with a rebound and now theyll put Isaiah Wong on the line another guy whos used to being in this spot finishing off games at the freethrow line and you mentioned earlier you know when your worst free throw shooters a 70 guy thats a luxury to have for Jim Blair Nega and the way theyve handled this remaining stretch try to get a big win here on the road better than 700 wins in the storied career of Jim larenega and a first time Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame finalist or Jim layer and egg and we talked about the resume for Carolina the loss would drop to 87 in the league 1610 overall they are oh and eight in Quad one they will have some opportunities theyre going to Raleigh theyre still going to host Virginia they will host Duke theyve got a chance to pick out some quality wins as Davis gets it to go and draws the foul but this would have been and its not over yet 18 seconds left this would have been a notable win for Carolina but Miami are playing well here on the road even though a couple of their key guys have been held far below their averages and this will be if North Carolina is unable to make a major comeback here over these next 181 seconds a major lost opportunity for the Tar Heels knowing that you have Miami coming into this building where youve been great all year and not walking away with a win on your home court youre going to see quite an atmosphere in Raleigh Music foreign will send Miller to the line you mentioned that atmosphere and again North Carolina beat NC State in this building earlier in January and people can talk about the Duke North Carolina rivalry all they want the true rivalry and when I mean hate theres a tremendous amount of hatred in Raleigh for these North Carolina Tar Heels the wolf pack together Applause Music together gets everybody out of the lane and Miller misses the first foreign Applause makes the second sixpoint lead love in and out Poplar down with a rebound fouled by baycott who has fouled out of the game and Miamis 78 seconds away from a nice Road win Jim larenaga clapping his hands right now as he walks up and down the Miami bench Jim larenagan knows that he has a really good team and he loves the test when they come in and play in a hostile environment as such against a good team in the North Carolina Tar Heels and more importantly walking away with a road win nothing more satisfying for a coach and you talk about Jim larenaga top 10 active coaches coaches in division one basketball and a big win for his team here tonight Music that makes coach L as they call him eight and nine against Duke as Miamis head coach in a win tonight will make him eight and ten against Carolina you go 1619 in this lead against North Carolina and do youre doing pretty well can they win here tonight makes him 44 500 record in Chapel Hill there very few coaches can say that they were able to do that throughout their career final score here in Chapel Hill Miami 80 and Carolina 72 Jordan Miller with 24 Nigel pack with 23 to lead the way as the Hurricanes go to 12 and
