in the win against Stanford on Saturday officials tonight Bert Smith Tommy morresy Tim clockery and Virginia Tech with the chorus of Enter Sandman will control to start heres the Freshman Ben Hammond lightning quick down low Migel potit backing down yigu the 7 fo2 Turk and they need that from poti without question Im really excited about this game because Virginia Tech is playing a lot better and theyre not tur the ball over and they run great half court offense all five of SMU starters average double figures in scoring Matt cross averaging a double double over his last four and yigu the Freshman has really come on down the stretch that one nearly poked away from BJ Edwards the former Tennessee v no good batted around cross whos been active on the boards and that allows Andy Enfield to play that small lineup up Second Chance Three cross kept it alive it comes to Hammond blocked by Chuck Harris Matt cross well traveled started his career at Miami played at Louisville couple of years at UMass for Frank Martin and there is the Big Turk the istan buul 7 foot2 freshman CET igu igu does so many things for SMU and he could could be the difference cuz hes a tremendous low post score Toby leall is Virginia Techs top scorer at 13 a game they had 17 in backtoback games both Road wins for Virginia Tech Tyler Johnsons the best perimeter Defender hes got the ball now another freshman shot clock at two Hammond hoists and hits thats the thing that ham has been doing for this Virginia Tech Team coming up with clutch shots but he also breaks the defense down a lot and gets guys easier shots he had struggled a bit with his shot after missing three games with a foot injury cross lines this one up overshot it Virginia Tech doesnt like necessarily the fast break but they will push the ball to get easy opportuni three for Jaden shot coming off a career high 18 you talk about playing with confidence I tell you what Mike young has done a great job with this team with their confidence the last couple weeks that shot was altered now you look at what Virginia Tech did the last two times out Road wins against Florida State Road win against Virginia they shot the three ball well in both and I tell you what Mike has done a great job with the confidence of this team they struggled early but they never look back and theyre playing extremely well right now especially shooting the basketball Edwards able to draw the foul number two J his first first first down shoot you know when you get behind a little bit and have some tough things go against you its easy to get down especially in this day and age cuz kids looking for quick gratification Mike young is stay patient this team has stayed together and I tell you what they do a great job executing their half court offense you think about it theyre at five and six in conference its speaks to what hes done he got his 400th win recently but if you told told me 6 weeks ago this team had a chance to be at 500 in League Play 12 games into the conference season most people would have put you in a straight jacket this team struggled early on they have turned the corner and they did it without a lot of players who had to be big time guys either here or somewhere else well that goes with the coaching staff not giving up on the players and the players feel that and sense that and they believe in themselves and they pick the game up boy Miller the former w Forest Demon Deacon into the corner in the three for Cario endo and if he gets hot with his offense it usually translates to better defense last time out he was a heater 16 points five of five from the field against Stanford folks that dont know this SMU team are surprised but uh Andy has gone out and got some veteran guys that can all score the basketball and thats what makes them so difficult to play against because they space the floor really well and they share the ball and they can knock down threes and the last component for this team theyve really come on in the last six weeks and have improved defensively Edwards strong Drive the Tipp in not there by igu and here comes Applause Hammond Hammond had a mismatch they had Lal matched up on Miller for a moment and that one knocked out by SMU Matt cross gives SMU the ability to go smaller with his ball handling and the fact that he rebounds the ball so well so you really dont miss not having another big guy in the lineup because he comes up with tough plays and you know I remember recruiting against him thats how long hes been around he been around Im telling you and he played for some really good coaches and really good programs and he came out of great program in Boston AI yeah hes averaging 15 10 over his last four and enters play fourth in the league in rebounding Edwards good position passes out of a triple team not sure what happened there with yigu the big guy has really good hands and great footwork and thats been the one thing that impressed a lot of people low over cross and it comes to Edwards Ive been surprised that Virginia Tech hasnt really run a lot of set yet o quendo too strong and right now SMU trying to play at that frenetic Fast Pace yeah and thats why coach just put up his hands up and said lets slow something down lets run our offense wesler is in there for Virginia Tech big guy in the middle five and black shoot from the foul line and the rebound snared by Edwards up ahead ok quindo through the contact and the finger roll Endo is big and strong and finishes well at The Rim the strength of this SM team especially on the wings really surprised me and their athleticism for people that havent really followed them theyre really talented Hammond dumps it off wesler contacted and a foul against SMU as we take her first media timeout one of the things the coaches talked to me about yesterday at practice was how they paid attention to detail scouting reports and that is really help this team pick up little things and that they took advantage of that against Virginia wesler got a piece of that on the shot by shoot Johnson front rim Hammond Second Chance new Music 20 Johnson in the paint kept alive another opportunity for the hokes theyve missed their last seven make it eight and finally cross snags the caram but thats okay but uh Virginia Tech got really good looks on that possession and I know coaching staff will be proud of Applause that o quendo off the shot fake you see the spacing SMU has theyre looking for dribble drives and kicks thats their offense thats the way they like to play and it gets poopy Miller an open look from three theyve got three guys on the perimeter with Miller cross Harris and a quendo that can put the ball on the floor penetrate and get open looks yeah fun point guard match up to Miller and Hammond mirror each others speeds the coaches uh challenge Hammond to contain Miller yesterday in practice too Virginia Tech has to put it up La rushed it got a piece of the rim another offensive rebound Johnson with two shots I think Virginia Tech right now is getting decent looks but they seemed a little rushed and theyre not getting their feet set and theyre not getting squared up on their shots I think they got to slow it down a little bit as now they gone to the bench and uh making some substitutions I think coach has seen that and its going to adjust maybe the way they play you know they went in early to petique and and he was able to score and then they stopped doing that I think that they can have get some Advantage out of that Andy Enfield in his first season at SMU after a nice run at USC five NCAA tournaments with the Trojans in 11 seasons and you and him were joking around and shoot around when he took the SMU job boy did that set off a chain reaction uh SMU is a sleeping giant Ive always believed that I think that the great fan base they got a lot of resources they really want to win and stepping into the ACC is just shown them the ability to do the things that they want to do has shown the nation what they how good they can be and hes the right guy for that job because offensively hes an excellent offensive coach Jaden young and now B Burnham the Charleston transfer Virginia Tech looking to dent a 100 SMU run young leans in and stops the bleeding great patience that time young took his time and drove the ball into the lane and his midrange game is the strongest part of his game hokes had missed their previous 10 from the field Harris might have gotten away with an extra step that Euro Step has gotten a lot of people as some easy basard and they get a foul on Harris at the other end Virginia Tech likes to do a lot of dribble handoffs likes to do a lot of pin downs and likes to run action where they bring a guy from the weak side to the ball side and SMU talked about that and shoot around and they plan on Switching a lot of that so they dont get taken advantage of yeah explain that to the novice fan when Andy nfield tells us we want to switch on their back screens whenever theres a screen that takes the balls on the right side that bring a guy to the ball they send the screen over to bring him there they just switch it so that way youre not out of position and it makes it easier to defend Andy nfield said hey we got to simplify young with the entry pass Burnham yigo got a piece knocked out of bounds itll stay with Virginia Tech only two to shoot crashed the college football playoff Andy M Fields team trying to get into the NCAA tournament one of the last or I should say first four out and uh coach Clark theyve done it with offense this year the highest scoring offense in the ACC and near the top in so many of those categories well Andys an offensive coach hes always been an offensive coach he got in this thing being known as a shot doctor no doubt and then he transitioned and so he likes a fastpac offense and in the portal he went out and got guys that can score and this is an older group Burnham does not come close Ive been really impressed with smus defense and the way theyve been closing out challenging every shot wild shot there Keon Ambrose Hilton denied pokies are four of 17 from the Music field you hear coaches talk about the pace of the game right now this Paces I think favoring SMU but thats what I think Virginia Tech has to do execute their offense slip the post and wind up getting finishes at the rim with their B pookies were one for their previous 12 before the dunk from potit Harris down the lane over potit and thats the ability that smus perimeter guys theyre all strong upper body they all can put the ball on the floor and they can attack the rim and they put a lot of pressure on you that way Chuck Harris a Virginia kid near the DC area Ashburn aways from here potit hes had some nice moves down low that time over the 72 freshman I think you have to keep going there because all of a sudden SMU is going to maybe have to come and double him which will free up some of your Shooters Burnham with the backside help open look rainbow three no good Edwards comes back to Harris hes open and connects vgia Techs got to do a better job rebounding the basketball uh coaches making some subs he wasnt real happy with that effort on the defensive glass that time SMU rebounds about a third of their misses thats good for third in conference play Applause Harris took the Baseline away from Young Rex Diner five to shoot potit swings it to Burnham and he beats the shot clock with a three this is where Virginia Tech has gotten better over the last couple game out of their offense recognizing where the rotations are and finding the open man and getting good looks like that one for six from three after making the first two ok quendo nothing but glass offensive rebound a tip knot there Ambrose Hilton tried to knock it in young pulls up iron sides a three ouu in the back court had to tie his shoe one of the things SMU has done is learned to play with their perimeter guys but being inclusive of the big guy eot to theyve got to give him his touches in the half court Harris going right at Rex Steiner air ball Virginia Tech likes this horn set where the two bigs are at the elbow and they wind up screening for the perimeter guys and then slip into the rim Young has been aggressive and Burnham gets bumped foul is on thats next Wednesday and I think CL Cooper flag basically has Player of the Year locked up in the ACC I think so Player of the Year freshman of the Year low inside draws the Applause foul we talk about the three Point shooting being Bandy edfield has yeah a lot of coaches now going playing with twopoint guards just to make sure it cuts down on the turnovers and everything but booby does such a great job of pushing the basketball now we saw him at Wake Forest last year and you watch wake this year and you say whats the missing piece boy imagine wake with boopy Miller uh the point guard play can never be overstated how important it is in college basketball those were the first two points for Toby low Virginia Techs leading score both Turks in there gorner and yigu its plural now the istan bulls and that one poked Applause away eotu I think has to get a little deeper post position a l while is hard for him to match up physically and hes allowing himself to get kicked out as he gets older and more mature and get used to this hell get deeper position oh Edwards Used the screen from yigu and the Virginia Tech defense disappeared yeah and thats something they went over each screen that SMU likes to use how they were going to guard it and it was just a mix up on that it should have been a switch wow stuck with it he is just getting better and better as the season has progressed and he speaks with a British accent cross fights his way past Burnham but you see right there with cross the physicality with which he plays at his size he really plays almost like hes 69 he knows how to use his body he knows how to post up and he gives SMU a real advant manage that way because hes got the skills of a perimeter player a wow no good for three Burnham tracks down the board another offensive rebound for Virginia Tech thats seven Hammond the sapling amongst the Seas now shoot laow off the shot fake gets inside and lays it in with the left the Wilds athleticism is really something special he can put the ball on the floor going right going left hes going to do nothing but get better hes been a pleasant surprise for Virginia tack pokes have hit five of their last seven cross drives and he is fouled wild week in the ACC Monday night Virginia stuns Pittsburgh last night Georgia Tech maybe caught Clemson looking at had to Saturday in Duke well the difference between winning and losing in the ACC has really been slight a lot of it has to do with some injuries and Georgia Tech has missed a lot of key guys they stepped up and they really played well Damon stalle Myers has been disappointed because he felt like even with the injuries they were good enough to win a couple of those close games now people start to wonder who can be this years NC State in the ACC tournament dont sleep on Georgia Tech no um their inside guys are playing really well but I think this SMU team I mean theyve really been impressive because of the veteran play that they have this is a mistake that guards always do to their bigs and instead of letting they dont let them get set up for the screen and they move before they get set up and The Bigs get C for moving screen see he needed to wait and let the post get set up before he came off of him and it created a foul on treor Cross went for the steel comes up with it Nifty dribbling and blocked at The Rim by Burnham potit the backside help but a foul oh Ben Burnham brought this crowd to its feet with the hustle a tremendous hustle there in transition right Burnham is a surprised athlete I think cross thought he had a Snowbird and watch it right there he kind of takes it easy and is cruising not on my watch and great block right there thats big time and then they get potit with the foul and Johan trayor native of France who led the big West and field goal percentage while at UC Santa Barbara last year at the free throw line yeah one more look all right be the judge on potit got too much body ah great effort I thought it was a good block hes above the ball so hes actually coming down hes not parallel with the ball so normally they let that go as a good block took the words out of my mouth you see that not called quite often now potit down low backing down TR and he gets the friendly home roll Fati has really slowed down his action in low post hes finding the rim and hes not being rushed early in the year he was rushed on his offensive opportunities ok quendo forced the shot scramble and Tyler Johnson was on the end Applause line are they going to talk about it I mean they let him battle till one team got possession of the ball then they blew the whistle ah boy hard to see yeah this might be a better look oh yeah his back going heres Edwards second season with SMU transfer from Tennessee serpent inside that slot Drive is a hard drive to be able to guard because if you beat the guy its really hard for help to come over and protect the rim so how do you defend it its hard I mean you you you really need the guy guarding the ball to be softer and and contain it because normally when its set up you got a guy a shooter in the corner and you got somebody at The Rim so if you come over to help they just throw the ball at the rim and theyre able to get an easy basket out of it trayor picks up his second it puts Virginia Tech in the bonus and Migel potit is someone who has shown that he can have big games there was a game against Miami earlier this month where he had 25 including a gamewinning and one and then since then its been a bit of a roller coaster ride up some games down some games over his last four only seven points little more than three rebounds but already nine going for 10 in the first half you know as a coach you want to see Improvement in guys during the course of the season and guys getting better at what youre asking them to do and forti is a a great example of a guy that has gotten better as a season progress being able to score a rebound and he gives them a physical presence inside iGo had great position just couldnt finish what hes not picking up the RIM today I mean we what do you mean by FMS of normally when he gets the ball he finds the basket and then he goes and makes his move today hes making his move without recognizing where the rim is and thats why hes missed a couple easy shots poti keeps it alive long three shoot yes thatll get this crowd going now he had a two game stretch in January at Stanford and at Cal where he went scoreless in 44 minutes in the six game since averaging more than a dozen a game shooting better than 40 from three and Johnson a little too aggressive picks up the foul offensive rebounds simu has not had a good shooting half they havent shared the ball like they normally do and theyve been challenged on everything and I think Virginia Techs hustle and toughness and grittiness have put them in position where they are right now they offensively they havent been as smooth as theyve been in the last couple of games Tech is showing its going to be a tough out the rest of the way offensive foul Tyler Johnson his Applause second it looked like Johnson had an angle where he could have gone straight in for a layup and he tried the Euro that actually took him into the defense watch him right here if he just keeps straight I think he has an angle to lay it up when he tries a Euro Step to get to the front of the rim which creates the offensive foul and okendo established legal guarding position and booby Millers back in the ball game yeah he had picked up his second foul with about 8 minutes to go in the first half so on the bench for about 5 and 12 minutes and coaches know who can play with in foul trouble and who cant poopys a veteran Edwards another Little Euro Step and the Euro finishes butti got caught he didnt Rim block he didnt Rim protect and he didnt block out for to get the uh defensive rebound either way way so Rex Steiners a good threepoint shooter hits the pull up twoin see thats when Virginia Tech offensively is at their best when they use the ball screens the dribble hand off and the action to get this Shooters open shots endos a microwave that time out of bounds to Virginia Tech Rex Steiner did a very good job of blocking out he he didnt even try to get the rebound he just made it tougher for his guy to be able to get it Virginia Tech last Leed at the 1703 Mark Rex Steiner for the lead thats a Mike young special right there you bring the big up and then you let him go pinned down for the shooter and Rex Steiner knocked down the three eight straight games with a three for the sophomore SMU meanwhile has missed nine of its last 13 the double almost got there but just a touch early and LW picks up the foul you see this action I talk about the Virginia Tech action there you see peti pinning down for Rex Steiner thats what they he started in a horn set give a dribble hand off and then came back in and pinned down for the shooter bigger roll for Rex Steiner this year after he backed up Shawn padulla and it says 33 threepoint shooter this year hes a better threepoint shooter than the numbers Applause indicate cross answers cross is such cross is a wild card hes like like the Joker I mean he can do a little bit of everything he can knock down the three he rebounds he just cant lolly gag when he got a dunk shot though Rex Steiner front rim offensive rebound potit left it Applause short SMU can retake the lead and a timeout by Andy Enfield stretch a win today theyre 500 in conference play and I take tell you what I mean I watched practice the other day the energy the attention to detail and The Scouting Report and thats where the coaches said thats really picked them up and helped this young team get better from the film session and the scouting reports and theyve really showing it today its turned into a broken record but its true Mike young despite losing all the talent he did he is one of the finest coaches in college basketball and a better person I mean he is the coachs coach he understands this game the con steps of it and hes got this team playing at a very high level cross beats the shot clock almost went in final 10 Virginia Tech with a chance to take the lead before halftime Hammond doubled knocked away Harris up to Miller its good if it goes and we are tied as we go to halftime whats the formula for SMU to take control I think that for SMU I think they love the space the floor they like dribble Drive they like penetrating kick I think they have to establish an inside game as you see they just turned it over cuz in a halfcourt offense the way Virginia Tech is defending and clogging up the driving lanes youve got to be able to get the isolation in the post to make the defense collapse only three turnovers for SMU of Virginia Tech part of their hustle too the block shots four in the opening half this is a team that averages about one block shot per game in conference play four in the opening half well they getting stronger David Jackson who used to play at Virginia CCH is the strength coach and he does an unbelievable job of getting these guys stronger and putting enthusiasm and physical play and they had four blocks against Virginia as well were going to get an illegal screen on lewow his second thats one coach can live with though again Virginia Tech goes and run runs that half court offense theyve been pretty effective with that you see SMU is trying to go inside theyre going with the monster double the mon been doubling the Freshman yigu a lot its given him problems yes we call it the monster double where you come over with you go big the big who put more size on him and put pressure on him being able to get pass the ball out of the double thats an old packline principle right cross wide open in and out ninth rebound for poti he came in at 69 260 only averaging about three rebounds per game in League Play Theres Tyler Johnson using the Lal screen and he knocks down the jumper thats where Johnson operates in that midrange area he gets that off the dribble weave and the penetration Miller no good lawal with that 49 half in vertical skies for the rebound I can tell you this is a tough place to play the students arent here in here like they normally are cuz this can be awful loud but if this crowd Gets behind this team theyre awful tough at home this Virginia Tech Team potit wants it and over the back on shet yigu Applause T is doing is keeping a body on igula I mean both offensively and defensively hes not had a freedom of movement like he normally has had in a lot of ball games and its given him some trouble thats the veteran against the greenhorn theres potit fifth year senior too easy and he is now closing in on a double double 11 points nine rebounds and thats the back screen theyre supposed to be switching Miller dips blocked by poti eatu fouled by Applause Hammond great weak side help there by Virginia T the the big guy he I tell you what hes going to be very good and hes got great hands hes got good footwork they making him play today a little faster than hes comfortable with but that will come with maturity and and thats the learning process if he misses this free throw free bacon for everybody look at the sco behind the basket I mean free bacon is free bacon this has been a pit for a lot of teams in the ACC believe me bacon for blackburg Miller gets the steel and that is foul number three if its on lall it is lawall made a mistake that they deflected the ball out of his hands and he thought he couldnt pick it up and he could pick the ball up he just couldnt dribble it again and thats why Virginia Tech was not able to come up with the ball well now you hear the chance for Music baconer boopy Miller career 82 free throw shooter checking in for number 20 Applause jell its my understanding if another visiting player misses two free throws its not another pack of free bacon you already got your free bacon now its about the game thats okay they just like they like to make their contribution defensively so it doesnt matter you know what would be nice though eggs SMU now with the pressure they they want to pick up the tempo right now the tempo seems to be going Virginia Techs way theyre playing at a face and the speed that theyre comfortable with SMU now has gone into the Zone how does Tech want to attack I think the same way taking their time dribble penetration and again theyre scoring at The Rim right now but they really SMU does not have a real whim protector great hands partner huh I had it all the way I had it all the way point guard Laughter skills Im a typical coach Im fading out of the way do we do we get a Applause replay Miller almost lost it boy Millers not able to penetrate much off of the half court cross wide open Burnham closed quickly cross over Burnham those two battled tonight but cross is so strong meanwhile Colbert lost his shoe running with one shoe in his hand and SMU gets the turnover he still has the shoe in his hand as cross is able to finish now finally gets his shoe on Im not sure its on all the way and hes got the heel on the back of the shoe now finally Colbert has his shoes on Jerell Colbert Jr from Houston Texas by way of LSU in Kansas State back up turn him flush again Virginia Tech running their office Hammonds been a little bit anxious with the basketball and hes got to slow Applause down OK quendo mugged itll stay with tech OK quendo is always on attack every time he gets the ball he doesnt he doesnt believe in reversing it he just attacks sucks up the double team and then kick you for the Music open Hammond to the Applause bench Miller to Music Applause inbound shot CL at 10 give and go to the Big Turk and thats what ubby Miller does and thats what veteran point guards do he doesnt have to score a lot of points but he sets up the other players and now they go back to the zone and theyre trying to do some things to kind of get Virginia Tech out of the rhythm of the half court its a 131 its a 131 with a matchup a little bit wesler kept it alive and a whistle underneath the seminal success helped Enfield get the Florida G Coast Job dunk City had the Great Run went on to USC and now SMU and Perry you took over the Miami job when coach ham left to go to the NBA without question and uh Leonard was a mentor to me uh when I was an assistant and when I became a head coach he stayed a mentor I tell you a quick story we were at the final four in Indianapolis is different than it is now cuz he came straight from recruiting there and I get to my hotel and his wife Claudette who everybody knows calls me and said will you come get your friend and I go to his room and Im standing outside the door and hes snoring and you can hear him all the way outside the door she said you got to take him out of here he went to my room and he snored so bad that I had to go BK with one of my assistants but thats how hard lard lamilton works with hes a tremendous mentor and you look at the people that come off of his tree and he certainly taught me how hard it how hard you have to work to be a head coach and a CEO of a basketball program he called you before the game did you tell him that was the story you were going to tell no no I told him I was GNA tell tell one of them and Ive got a couple more but he without question was the best assistant coach in college basketball when he was at Kentucky the deatu Andy Enfield telling us that Leonard Hamilton showed Andy Enfield how to build a program how to run a program he still considers coach Hamilton a friend a mentor and you know in Black History Month you go back to Leonard Hamiltons career when he was an assistant coach at Austin P the head coaching job opens up Leonard Hamilton was thought to be the guy to take over and he was told Austin P isnt ready for a blackhead coach even though youre the most qualified he was ready to give up coaching in fact he goes back home to North Carolina takes up a Salesman job for Dow Chemical says Im done with coaching a week later Joe beh Hall from Kentucky calls offers him the Kentucky job and if were being honest he was probably at Kentucky for longer than he should have been before he got the chance to be the head coach at Oklahoma State he really was and but just a tremendous intellect as well as being a good coach and understanding people and putting the right people in the right situations the three by Burnham gives Virginia Tech a threepoint lead endo with the answer at the other end and SMU has made five straight from the field well quindo does a great job of coming into the game for SMU and picking up scoring right away he can catch and shoot he can drive the basketball they stay in their 131 right now to take away some of the ball screens that Virginia Tech was using to penetrate thats two great looks from that corner shoot missed but a foul is called on you watch the roll right there and thats what I talked earlier about getting the big guy involved and thats the best way to do it and theres Burnham in the corner he loves those Corners now and O quindo does a great job catch and shoot from the wing Music comes back to Rex Steiner tend to shoot Burnham shot fake Rex Steiner fake pass almost rebound cross cross does a great job on that glass though and thatll be a blocking foul on shoot before the shot meanwhile bopy Miller back on the SMU bench hes got three fouls Toby laal on the Virginia bench with three fouls right now its a good time to rest Miller because quendo is just doing such a great job see the burst of speed right there and going in and see how he uses his body to protect the ball quendo one of the top reserves in the ACC averaging just a tick under 10 points per game 99 his upper body strength I mean lead the team scoring the difference though with SMU those guys transferred and play Big minutes for other schools so theyre more veteran and thats what SMU is taking Applause advantage plenty of time to shoot Edwards going Baseline on Rex Steiner wants help cross puts the body into Burnham and gets two every time he gets the ball he lays that body into you create space and then is able to score good offensive players know how to create space for their shot 13 points for cross he leads all scores Rex Steiner belong to rebound Harris ok quendo machetes into the lane and walk give Virginia Tech a lot of credit today theyve done a really good job of shutting down the driving lanes because SM is not scoring because they not shooting the ball well theyre not scoring because theyre being defended and thats a big difference the Mustangs one of Joe lardys first four out a group that includes Wake Forest and pit from the ACC as well potit now tried to spin cycle one too many times and that will be SMU ball now I think they might change the call I think theyre going to talk I think theyre going to talk I Bert Smith wants to talk with Tommy morrisy yeah thats the right call they change it I tell you what officials have gotten better at adjusting and talking more with each other and coming up with the right calls that was a soccer move by Chuck Harris Balls going near the sideline youre trying to use the body to keep it in play Jaden young strong Drive potita rebound hes got a double double Burnham dips and scores Burnham is such a smart crafty player not only can he shoot the the three he also knows how to use his body in the post area Burnham against cross has been a nice little subplot tonight but you see that drive right there by Ed he had no place to go and had to kick it out thats good defense Harris is trying to penetrate he cant thats good defense cross wants it Harris instead a three Johnson the Applause rebound we are tied for the ninth time tonight we were tied at the half at 35 potit against the Freshman yes thats thats the ball screen hard roll to the front of the rim good pass and a good finish Elijah potit with his aame tonight hes got Applause 13 Harris for the lead SMU on top thats good offense that was great great defense and just better offense that time by Harris coming off of that but what Im saying Virginia Tech has done a great job of eliminating the dribble drives for kicks five lead changes nine ties burnam the back door cut the feed from potit whos been the Maestro at times well whenever the ball goes in that high post against that zone the big has to come up to play the guy the foul line and theyre getting the back cut from the other way Applause Burnham got one at the other end cross the follow and one 15 for cross 13 for Ben burn for Mike young and he averaged a robust 64 points per game last year tells you what Mike young was working with coming into the season it explains the slow start but weve seen this team get better backtoback Road winds last week Florida State and Virginia now at home giving an SMU team that cannot afford to lose tonight all they can handle the patience Mike young has had with this ball club and bringing it along Rex Diner that would have been for the lead offensive rebound Johnson and were tied yet again for the 10th time I dont think fans understand how hard sometime coach have it to keep a team up especially when is not being successful cuz kids only know what they see and what they feel and to make them believe in something that hasnt happened yet is a is a hard thing to do and thats what Mike young has done with this vir Tech Team especially in the age of the portal cross slithering the rebound by low and hes fouled by Colbert so Toby low back into the game with the three fouls boy Miller remains on the bench for SMU now Lew has to figure out how he can become effective in this type of game and so far you know hes trying to feel his way but he I think hes got to play off of the dribble handoffs hes got to play off of the screen and roll action that Virginia Tech likes to play and thats where hes going to get his opportunity and you talked up booby Miller cuz he just came in they heard you boy is back in averaging almost six assists per game hes been quiet today as well a lot of potit a lot of Burnham whos not on the floor for Virginia Tech inside 10 Colbert tried to deny potit gets called for the foul its his second potit did something really smart there he went to post up Cobra got in front of him but he didnt accept that and changed his position and was able to draw the foul a lot of times post guys will hide behind the defensive player and make it more difficult to be able to feed them the ball the next foul by SMU puts Virginia Tech in the bonus off the hand of potit turnover number 10 for Virginia Tech that was one thing they did real well on the road they took care of the ball against Florida State and Virginia okendo the corner three and the Mustangs retake the lead between o quendo and cross offensively is hard for the Mustangs to go into a drought for long periods of time cuz those two young men know how to manufacture baskets 11 now for o quendo theyre really pressuring Rex Steiner shoot coming off that careerhigh 18 and the Duke transfer makes it a onepoint game shoot is tricky hes got good ball hes not just a catch and shoot guy he can put it on the floor and go create when he has to Colbert has it poked Away by Johnson Miller almost got it back and a foul and theyre going to get Rex Steiner on the reaching to the crowds dismay yeah but Shu took a shot there going for a loose ball Applause Music watch the shoot right there got took a shot and there you see a loose ball and they call Rex Steiner for a foul but I shot took a shot early in that possession now starting to get intered Applause partner SMU one of Joe ards first four out Miller using the window nothing this is a quad three game for SMU they have not lost to a quad three or a quad four team but the Freshman Tyler Johnson with a three gives Tech a twopoint lead theyve got big hopes for Johnson hes come in defensively hes done a great job and with him been able to knock down that jump shot just make it even tougher to be able to play against Hammond back in he can match Millers speed and a chance for three the oldfashioned way for Chuck Harris those wins were against Delaware State USC Upstate and Winthrop a win by Virginia Tech also gets the hokes to six and six in conference Harris missed the free throw Burnham bothered the shot on the follow by igu Burnhams Been Everywhere a dozen points hustle plays at the Block and transition on Matt Crow Music cross Hammond has been out of control at times tough Runner easy rebound yeah you dont like that I can tell well I I thought he had some other options that maybe he could have gone through but again hes a young player and hes learning and this is how you get better Edwards has not scored in the second half finds Harris for the two inside 14 for Chuck Harris offensively this SMU team just knows how to play they know how their skill set to be able to pass catch and shoot is at a high level and their decision making is a mature one that veteran players have as opposed to younger players the question is their defense and Andy Enfield feels theyre getting better defensively over the last six weeks shot clock at two Hammond leans in the Freshman ties the game Hammond has talent and you know you you the only way you develop Talent is Let It Grow itself and theres some things that the only way you understand you have to go through it and thats what hamers is doing right now Harris with 14 17 for Harris another triple SMU four of six from deep in the second half you cant hide behind the screen that time I did a game with Paul bardi ESPNs National director of recruiting he said he watched Hammond playing high school at Paul v 6 he said absolute Warrior ultimate winner Toby L Corner three nothing there knocked out by SMU less than two to shoot see the Wilds got to pick up his game right now he is a out hes been on a great run hes a really talented player and this is what Im talking about Big Time Players make real time decisions they make adjustments to how theyre playing whats working whats not working and they and they adjust their game to that and hes that caliber of player and thats what he has to do what do you draw up here A A Hard roll to the basket a hard roll to the basket Rex Steiner tries to get it in burn him open front rim Tracked Down by Edwards yigu almost traveled may have traveled they dont call it he gets the two and its a twopossession game thats tough one to run out right Applause there this is important part of the game right now for Virginia attch theyve been playing so well theyve got to execute theyve got to get good shots each time down shoot the cutter off the feed from Burnham and then shoot knows he lost his balance pushes bopy Miller and is called for the foul it looked like both of them got banged up a little bit theyre mopping up the floor at the spot where the foul was committed and shoot with a noticeable Music limp thats a smart play by guard you just stop you know the guys coming up your back itll be a one and one eighth team foul on Virginia Applause Applause Tech Five Points four assists for Miller Applause one of the top free throw shooters in the ACC we have an ACC Network mens basketball triple header tonight weve got a double header next Wednesday Stanford against what is becoming a dangerous Georgia Tech Team and then Cal pays a visit to Cooper flag and Duke one out of two kept Alive by Ambrose Hilton and a fresh 20 for SMU this is a very important part of the game right now for Virginia tack Miller accelerates and makes it a seven uh rather a sixpoint game right now Virginia Tech is small they really dont have the physicality inside so theyre going to have to execute their offense really well and try to come up with a couple threes inside laal elevates and draws the Applause foul see theyre trying to talk L right now L is not a natural post guy you know and theyre trying to post him up like right now and its a little bit more difficult for him hes a great athlete hes a slasher catches the ball drives it well knocks down the midrange shot so three fouls now on Parris the physicality that SMU plays with has been surprising you know watch teams on filmm you think you have a feel you see them in person you kind of get a different perspective this SMU team is physical and how they play the game and very aggressive and has thrown Virginia Tech off a little bit how theyve answered the bell in terms of the physicality and no free throw struggles over the last three games have been real for Virginia Tech Lal gets one out of two but entering today in the previous three games the hokes were 44 out of 74 from the stripe thats below Music 60 cross goes to work on the wow they like the post crossed up a lot of times when the shot clock goes down Miller against Hammond Miller doesnt get the roll tipped into the air Lal the Applause rebound Hammond accelerates drops it off for the fellow freshman Johnson Cyclones inside potit back in there and they get a foul on yigu second time hes committed a foul on an entry pass the nfield emphasizing right now if Im Virginia Tech weve got to execute our offense weve got to go inside and we got to knock down some open threes that we can get off of our running our our half good offense SMU I think theyre going to attack the rim off the dribble throw the ball into the paint and continue to be physical Mr Cross Mr Cross Mr Cross he just seems to have a nose for the ball and come up with the big plays poate made at the front end of the one and one gets them both 15 from elel Applause potit Miller Edwards Harris CR cross and yigo on the floor for Applause SMU Edwards swivels grabbed by Lal whos out there with Hammond potit shoot and Johnson thats you going to continue to attack that rim Music Applause inside of 10 to shoot its shoot on the drive turns Fades too much Applause turnover and thats not his game no its not but hes capable of making that but they had a chance to come up with an offensive rebound and just got away from it same recipe right now SMU again its going to face the floor theyre going to try to attack off the dribble Edwards has had a solid allaround game six points seven rebounds seven helpers poops the Catalyst drives kicks the extra pass Harris pot of gold on the back end of the rainbow hes got 20 thats what veteran players do they play at a pace again I think Virginia Tech has done a good job defending SMU and SMU is has done a really good job when they needed to to step up and take away a lot of Virginia Techs actions two minutes to go wow through the contact foul on the floor so itll be a one and one for Toby laow and they get the freshman yigu and thats what Im talking about that time he attacked the pression and thats the way theyve been playing him all game as soon as he gets the ball somebodys right there in his face that is four on the 7 foot2 freshman from istan buul and free throw struggles continue continue to be a thing this is where SMU theyve got three ball handlers actually four if you want to C count cross at the fourth spot they can make foul shots they can make good decisions with the basketball this is whats going to make this team so tough as it goes down the stretch theyve got some really good free throw shooters on the floor too shot clock at Three cross lets it Fly and hits SMU with its largest lead of the game its the largest lead by either team tonight I mean I thought they defended I thought they did a good job take SMU out a lot of things they wanted to run SMU just stepped up and put it in another gear and made plays when they really had to shoot its a three Tech not going away quietly sixpoint game 109 to go t teams now loster reset and again they came into tonight needing a win to get to 500 in League Play after a tough start and hes never complained I mean he he never complained hes never used it as an excuse and you know thats the quality of the man stolen away by Hammond leall with two shots and it stops the clock with 106 thats thats an uncharacteristic turnover by SMU I mean theyre basically playing with five ball handlers on the floor great effort right there steel lall goes up strong now comes down to some foul shooting 67 on the season fourpoint game 106 to go run the Baseline theyve got time they dont have to foul Harris trapped and hes got to burn a timeout amongst the next four out as of now the ACC only a three bid League Duke Louisville and Clemson one minute to play one minute to play Edwards gets it across cross the timeline and now Applause Retreats boy Miller hits some big shots this season had the gamewinning three against Virginia a gamewinning Runner against Cal Baptist come up with a high ball screen with cross Corner three doesnt get anything from Edwards Tech can get to within one with a three but they dont need a three Hammond takes up the bounce shoot was the closer and the win against NC State Hammond to the rim and a blocking foul called it looks to be on Edwards and two shots now for missing the ACC tournament currently in the bottom three in the conference bottom three dont make it this year and Hammond gets the first its a one possession game theyve already talked about the pressure you like to go I like to go man because it makes it hard to throw it in against the Zone youre giving them to throw in and then youre trapping the first pass both free throws good Mike young calls a timeout seven in one situation for SMU but Ive seen too many teams use the time trying to chase the steel or something you need to use the time offensively to get a good shot SM only turned it over six times today they get it into cross they got a foul and Miller fouled by Hammond thats the guy smmu wants at the free throw line as that one coach where know bopy Miller was in a tough spot there could you have waited to foul no as soon as it got in we didnt get it after the first trap they thought they should have fouled right away and you know if the other team goes and make their foul shots then its its tough to beat them but you you put the pressure on them having to make the one and one it is a one and one Miller three for four from the line tonight and this one would make it a twopossession game if he misses and your SMU do you foul I wouldnt but I think you do what you practice and thats not a cop out I just think that your kids are used to playing time and score and so they know how to react two possession game SMU with five players now I think double figures and I think nfield is saying dont foul yeah go hard to the rim go hard to the rim take the lay out Hammond crossed the rebound now theyve got a foul and Matt cross to the free throw line with a chance to end Applause it what a game Matt cross has played I mean hes done it on both ends especially stepping up bounding the ball knocking down jump shots when they were necessary this SMU team has a lot of weapons and having done a lot of SMU games I can tell you their support there they got a huge donor base thats here at this game they came up with the team on the private plane I mean this SMU program is for Real athletically and theyre going to really be a factor in the Applause ACC final 6 Music seconds lall puts it up no good its rebounded by SMU and the Mustangs survive at Castle Coliseum I tell
