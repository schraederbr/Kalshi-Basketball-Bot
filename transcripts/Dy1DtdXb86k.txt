Elite shooter one of the best in the country currently shooting 50 from three when he plays well the Cavaliers generally play well although hes coming off the poorest shooting performance of the year against Memphis where he was just one of eight it was the first time this season that he didnt connect on a made threepoint field goal mcne has made at least two threes in eight of the 11 games the whoos have played this season they are going to try and get him going and Tony Bennett said to us earlier today weve got to finds to get him off thato line movement off the ball teams have played him a little bit more physically he is a key to our season we are ready to rock at the jpj in Charlottesville and the who who have been o so good in this building control the rock Morgan State starts and manto man thats really what coach Kevin brus wants to do but he knows knows hes going to have to switch it up tonight thats mcne got a good look could not connect offensive rebounds for the whoos they fell to Memphis 7754 right before the holiday break Tony Bennett saying they took us to the Woodshed another three that one short by Andrew Ro and in that game coach ree beakman was fantastic but theyre trying to find other guys that they can get involved as you take a look at Morgan states starting five and a few new fa in that starting five for Morgan State well talk more as the broadcast goes on due to illness and injury but back to your point Arya they simply did ree bigman didnt have any help that night and the shooters need to shoot the players inside need to do what they can whether its free those shooters or free for themselves beatman continues to play like one of the best players in the country that three ball goes down its Jake Groves the transfer from Oklahoma up and down this season for The Who but when he goes hot this Cavaliers team really takes a step forward yeah half his shots are behind the arc this season three shots behind the Y to start this game for the Cavaliers Ro had 12 points against Memphis thats another turnover created by Virginia a team that has really been forcing turnovers this season as opposed to yearss pass under Tony Bennett he told us when were able to do that it gets us into transition AIDS our offense as that shot Groves could not connect on the spin move high off the glass well theyve been able to extend a little bit more this season because of their athleticism a young Virginia team that does have talent that is athletic but they have tried to find ways to get more cohesive well right now its all about the defense theyve just got to find a way to get better offensively Roes again from Shore range not able to connect nice Fe inside but theyve been able to rely on their defense still second in the an opponent points per game allowed a St under Tony Bennett he said its always got to be defensive for us it can never rest it keeps us in games nice little floater there by Hobs Hobs the lone returning starter for this team he is a solid guard and again because of some injury some illness hes going to need to be on top of his game against this Cavaliers perimeter defense Virginia and on the not a lot of returners coming back theres onece beakman 99th career start here evening in Charlottesville the bester the who the experienced andon Bennett saying this has a good transition for turning into a leader he hasnt had the opportunity to be passive this season he has had to be the initiator for The Who on offense well most importantly he knows who he is and yes he has been more assertive in his fourth year jumper there knocking to fall beakman one of the best passers in the country the reigning ACC Defensive Player of the Year as well jumper deep bang theres Ro they need him to play a very talented transfer from St Thomas hes been scoreless the last two games missing all seven threes he missed his first one here tonight a good sign he was able to connect on that last one count the basket and the Music foul well the Cavaliers able to get what they want at the offensive end Ro thats a good sign when now place where Tony Bennett has thrived in his time with the Cavaliers you just look at those numbers Dean I mean its incredible one of the best homec Court advantages in all of college basketball well home sweet home for Tony Bennett 15 years there is a culture here and its no reason no no surprise why they are so good at home the way they play at both ends of the Court little bit of pressure here by the Bears trying to force a little bit of tempo out of the Cavaliers now theyll have to watch it again because of a shorter bench I dont know how much they can play for you know 94t throughout the evening no that Dean what are your keys to the game here uh as we take a look first at Kevin brus what do you want to see from both sides well from Morgan State theyve got to find some e easy baskets they simply cant afford long droughts and they got to battle on on the boards this is an area and we saw it before break there where they may be able to steal a few baskets I think for for Virginia right theyve got to have a little bit of Rhythm on offense just 22 points in the second half in that last outing against Memphis and theyve got to impose their will look by every measurable metric theyre bigger stronger faster deeper they just need to be dialed in in their last tuneup before ACC really kicks in bes Di the beginning of the tonyn steady the NBA draft Waters in The off seon decided to come back and the Cavaliers and their fans just excited for what he brings to the table he has elev his GCE defense again youve just youve got to mentally be be prepared to guard and face that defense for 20 to 25 seconds midrange J there for RO and the Bears clean the glass little Runner rolls off the rim offensive rebound stick back not going to go itll stay with Morgan State thats an area that Virginia is looking to try and improve upon as the year goes along is the rebounding and have their work on the glass it absolutely is and you see right there they werent able to Coral that thing even though Morgan State didnt fully get it they recyle a shot clock to 20 and they get another opportunity to put some points on the board thats exactly what they need to do and its an area they can see some success throughout the night but your points well taken Virginias collectively its not just one guy rebounding better collectively they all have to be better as a in conference Play Its been a story line for them early on their fans media coaching staff included who STS up in add to theyve been able to rely on that defense it forces shot clock violations like it did that guy is a in the lanes and they appreciate those more than anyone in college basketball at the jpj beakman is just a classic oldo old school point guard he knows what to do with the offensive end he assist to turnover G three and a half to one and then at the defensive end and I think his wings span and his size really helps him right there he just he just bottled up hops had no idea where the shot clock was on that possession Ro nice drive uses the glass to his Advantage virgin up Ro and M mcney both theyve got to get better and they are better than they were 10 games ago but putting it on the floor thatll free them into some open shots on the perimeter a nice feed but shuffling his feet theyre inside on the feed from Lawson we talk about injuries Dean coach uh this Morgan State team is without some of its best players including Winston tabs who started his career at Boston College in the ACC and was a true ACC level player at that time then transfer to East Carolina continue to put up numbers but he B knee injuries at every stop and that is what has him sidelined again tonight the hook from Buchanan not going to go but the ball will stay with the Cavaliers two starters are out for Kevin brus here this evening as you take a look and Kieran Oliver who provides some punch out with a thumb injury too it was always going to be an uphill challenge here tonight for Morgan State but coach its going to take everybody you even heard they might play some zone for large portions of the game to try and slow UVA down yeah and speaking to to coach brought us yesterday he said look what we have to get better at first of all we got to get healthy but were defending better this is just another opportunity for us to play a high level game and get ready for what really matters most and thats M play how fun is Reese be that midrange jumper is sweet another steel for the Cavaliers its number three on the night nice job there by Murray defensively having his head on a swivel great feed from Ro inside Buchanan he couldnt hold on it was deflected out of bounds but they love Blake Buchanan on this sta 611 freshman from Idaho flashed earlier this season in Charlotte 18 point s rebound against the gator of Florida a bright future its a very talented nucleus that Tony Bennett is hoping turns into some experience three top 100 players in the recruiting class here now in Charlottesville there theres Talent on this roster make no mistake Buchanan be one of them in time he is a high level ACC forward late shot CL buz RS out Virginia will hold on to the basketball and much like we talked about at the other end in that previous possession by Morgan State Virginia not able to Corral the rebound but keep it alive it goes off on the Bears and they get another chance with 20 on the shot clock Bennett already deep into his bench that shot was from T Murray only plays about 12 minutes a game Leon into the game as well Murrays a guy thats been productive in limited minutes this season give him credit he has stuck around each year hes gotten a little better hes just playing behind some really good guards shs shot clock 10 great fundamental defense from the Cavs UD simply didnt know what to do picked up his dribble shot clock running down nothing easy for the Bears and conversely Virginia able to get some baskets do what they want offensively they havent been connecting at a high rate but that said they still lead 14 to5 only Cavalier with true you know game experience yearoveryear but when you lose guys like Jaden Gardner and Kate Clark and vanderplas Frank I mean they lost 50 points last year thats a lot of Firepower its going to take time thankfully defense carries them or has carried them but theyre going to have to get some flow and Rhythm and theyre going to have to get better at that end to compete at a high level come ACC play nice drive to the bucket for the Bears cuts the lead in half but back to that inexperience for Virginia 134th this season in D1 experience if you look at Ken pomoys metrics 3 seconds out of 362 teams in minutes continuity which takes into account how many returning minutes you have play open count for grov and now Virginia leads by dou digits but last season coach four in D1 experience for Tony Bennett 12 Ines coming back 71 so thats the for Bennett you have to have experience you have to have guys that have been in the system as a blocking foul called on the loose yeah you and I were talking to him earlier today and he said look we went to Memphis we got schooled but whether you win or lose in a tough environment youre going to grow and so he saw the positives even though there werent a lot in that Memphis game and he wanted to get back and reestablish good basketball tonight theyve done that in the early going Amari Simpkins misses the first free throw want to remind you Friday right here on acc Network well have a mens basketball double header Miami hosting UNF at six and then ninth ranked UNC they host Charleston Southern to cap off the 2023 schedule cant wait to see what 2024 has in store for us Dean this league it has taken a step forward theyve got some big nonconference victories its going to make conference play even more important with more opportunities for one wins in the net no question about it right the ACC one of three leagues to have at least six teams in the net top 50 done fouled on the drive theyll go to the line Ryan Dunn the sophomore some pegging him as a potential first round pick in this years NBA drafts defensively outstanding right coach can get into the passing Lanes as offense continuing to develop but you can see what Scouts are dreaming on hes a big time athlete leads the team in rebounds and blocks second in steals a close second I might add to ree beakman but one of the reasons they didnt red shirt him last year was because of his energy and just willingness to to work and youre youre still seeing that tenacity and energy grow and to your point as the offense comes along hes almost a microcosm of this Cavalier team as he gets better offensively boy his best basketball is ahead that three misses the mark save back into play the Bears recover drive and the layup is good that was Hobs nice job by Hobs right there and that was really the right thing to do he had the the Cavaliers kind of backpedaling right there and just attack the rim 17 10 Virginia over Morgan say this is the fif all meeting between the Bears and the who shot locked inside nice roll to the basket by D Im not Im not quite sure though why you know he wanted to go to the other side of the rim I thought he should have taken it up initially without that little dribble inside it really caused him to get in trouble bman tees it up bang re bman As Good As It Gets in this conference third Team all AC selection last year every bit of that and then some this year make no mistake he is the leader of this team he tried to keep Virginia in it on the road against Memphis last week still played pretty well 13 points shared the basketball well has always gotten his teammates involved he is a prototypical benett point guard that question now becomes who STS up in addition because this kid is going to give you everything hes got each out no exactly right nice looking three right there you know he is going to be throughout the record books when his career is over throughout UVA basketball and I think theyre I think they have called that that it wasnt tipped I dont know that on that pass Ro was trying to look at the corner and uh hes trying to say it was tipped but officials think otherwise but yeah back to beakman you know leads the ACC in steals assists a turnover ratio he is exactly the kind of point guard you want if youre Tony Bennett for that matter if youre at a high major School top in career assist for The Who isman that jumper misses the mar five in Steels hes got the rock as he crosses midt he talked about his play last outing against Memphis he did try to keep him in it they just couldnt no one else could make shots they were one of 10 behind the arc mcne couldnt make any Ro didnt make any it was just it became tougher and tougher in a really really tough environment in Memphis count and foul Ryan flexing his muscles showing you his strength and tenacity he was really the only other Cavalier as you see this again little shot fake to get Simkins in the air and then finishes with strength he did have a career a second career double double in Memphis 11 points 11 rebounds some of those came too late but you love everything about his work ethic as Applause well knocks down the bonus free throw Ryan is one to watch only player in the top 35 in both blocks and steals in the country long athle evolving offensive game its becoming more and more difficult for the Bears As Time ticks away here in the first half to get anything easy even out of the double team absolutely coach Virginia has forced five turnovers as well make it with the charge and they are flying to the basketball who theyre in control for offense to another level coach they have done a wonderful job here of moving the basketball around and finding different guys three different players have made a three for the and thats what Tony Bennett wants he wants the goto guy to be that open guy and as you pointed out they have shared it and its so key that they make shots behind the Arc you see it right there nine wins theyve shot just under 40 not so good in the losses and you dont want to put it just on McNeely and roie but those two are have shot taken almost half the threes on the season for Virginia great feed inside not able to finish though was done he did stay with it will go to the line Bo your point a terrific pass by Andrew roie just kind of curled off that down screen saw duns man come with him and threw it only where dun could catch it just couldnt finish boy Ryan i like to have that one again both Ro sophore yeah excuse me I know I was going to say roie and and McNeely those two shooting threes they they really have to play like theyve got three lungs in ACC play and that is theyve got to continue to move without the ball to free themselves but also sometimes to be decoy and and move and free others Dean thats been the key to Virginia hasnt it in years past its not always just one guy its three four guys that can beat you speaking of wow what a jumper there from the midrange sweet stroke well a much needed basket right there by the Bears just nothing easy turn over only the second beakman just lost concentration there for a minute on that one that was unlike him on the pass into the post coach that was a problem for virginis Applause effort and say that was ger talent and freshman nowman unselfish and its on the finish and thats Virginia basketball turning defense into offense to your point gerud they lifted that red shirt against Texas AM partly because of how well he was planned but also with Dante Harris being out a terrific individual move right there saved the ball kept it alive and then gave it to beakman who pass pass at the dun and he knows how to finish it inside duns now got six points five rebounds beakman couple of assists looking for that back door cut intercepted transition oh he missed Jord Miner a in this game that one will show up tomorrow in the film room they were running really a beautiful three onone Gertrude filled the left lane minor of the right lane but as you said couldnt finish the dunk right there nonetheless they were able to come back get a stop and reset again Jord Off the Applause Mark Jordan Miner a guy that really coach bent wants to get more playing time its been difficult fouryear player at marry and coplayer of the year last year was the defensive player of the year in the NEC although playing predominantly Zone he has adapted well and quickly and I I think the biggest thing that coach Bennett said is hes a better player than he is student athlete and we know how talented he is as a player on the nice cut by B thats what good players do when youre overplayed you go back door nice Cut nice find 16point Advantage here for Virginia deep three he launch off to the right and mcne grabs the board and thats what happens sometimes when youre playing this Virginia Defense is boy that first look even though its maybe not be the shot you want a little deep you take it because everything else is so hard now Music 13 Jord Min Aton for the dunk Virginia up not much the Bears can do right now now at either end the Virginia Defense has him flustered We Go Again late in the shot clock just Lawson spinning turning throwing it up hes fou but Virginia so far coach has been fantastic on both sides of the ball they certainly have and theyve been finding the open man minor Bond whos up big how about some New Years resolutions for Virginia de a program that has won the ACC 4 the last six years yeah they are the gold standard right now in the ACC all due respect to Carolina Duke and others look theyve got to hit the glass theyve got to find Shooters and theyve got to stay the defense and what do we mean by that you know even without the experience up front defense Remains the Cornerstone of Tony Bennetts program there is an expectation of playing high level basketball but theyve got to rebound better and theyve got to shoot it better come ACC play When the calendar turns to 2024 to your point exactly coach its a Virginia team last year top 40 in the country in cleaning the glass they make it really hard for teams to have extra possession but then you look at thison and theyre 29 in the country in that same Mark thats definitely going to be Ana they want to clean up before the start a conference play it is and when you talk about hitting the glass and finding Shooters some of that sometimes that goes hand in hand when youre not shooting well go rebound and clean up those offensive misses for Second Chance opportunities 303 Lawson splits the free throws he leads the Bears with Five Points Inside Out play turnover deflected into transition itll stay with the Bears nice work by Bon getting back on defense Bs a guy that he red shirted last year it really helped him as you see there with the steel oh how about it behind the up and around that was nice fromond talented top consensus recruit coming out of high school he is flashed in games this season and think about that you know a top one 100 top 70 guy red shirting in this day and age of the transfer portal its just very unique but you know I find it very refreshing you love everything about Tony Bennetts program Murray cleans the glass T Murray from New Zealand oh there you go he made he Applause didnt byg state it is all Cavaliers right now Jordan min a micros of what theyre doing here in Charlottesville Virginia stifling on the defensive end Coach one field goal made in the last seven minutes from Morgan State none in the last four minutes plus and unfortunately Kevin brus just doesnt he looks down that bench and doesnt have a lot of options right now but youre exactly right the defense just smothering the Bears right Applause now yet again Im not sure if dun got a hand on that he certainly altered the shot Bean no issues ding to the dou FES hes got 11 well at least through the first 18 minutes not quite done with the first half its the kind of game that can get that bad taste out of your mouth what Happ in Memphis Y Applause and you see the Bears without a field goal in the last five plus minutes theyve tried to create some Gooding they just cant get any ding lines hard hedge there by dun Applause love how the Cavaliers just move their Applause feeted on the Virginia now with two BLS to go along with six steals excuse me the kind of guy that can keep together even in a game like this where it stays structured and they continue to run what they want to run look this is this is one of those prepare for war in times of Peace games it isnt necessarily about today its about ACC play and getting things right Bonds got six Lawson from Deep hes got eight after that triple he was on the all rookie team in the Mak last year and if you can get C Hobs Rob Lawson and the injured Winston TS back youve got a nice back court how nice was that Applause coach basket you see some holiday cheer and smiles in the crowd well the Cavaliers just getting what they want offensively right now the Bears unsure if they should trap hard hedge makes no difference beakman finding the open man dun has struggled from the line now two of six from the charity strike that hasnt been that charitable to Virginia this season rare to see a Tony Bennett team struggle from the free throw line we end the half with a brick there from Morgan State coach so far after stands up so good for Tony Bennett in the Absol although vett and staff will find things that they need to clean up is you know look this is a game thats getting them helping get that bad taste out of their mouth from Memphis theyre gaining some confidence they played 10 guys but really you want to see it all you want to continue to see that defense that nationally ranked defense thats only second to Houston in scoring but you also want to see him shareing the basketball and making good decisions at the offensive end Virginia 53 in that first half and they lead by 27 nice start to the second for the Bears that was a that was Tren Edwards out of Lexington Kentucky Rison staff are really high on that freshman 68 said he just needs some strength and game experience bman left corner step back jumper mcne still trying to find ways to get going he has struggled over the last three games he really has he hes had at least two made threes in all but two games but its hit a little bit of a wall here and you dont know if its mentally or not for great Shooters like Isaac just needs to see it go through the hoop behind the arc one time nearly third in the country threepoint field goal percentage 50 on the year coming in a stretch where he hit six threes in backto Back Games missed everything all his attempts when you talk of the great Shooters in ACC history and there have been a ton you know Curtis Staples Dennis Scott JJ reick I mean the list goes on and on a guy like Isaac mcil Im not ready to put him in that category yet but but he has to have that mindset that confidence and have that short memory get to the next shot whether the last one went in or not three ball there is good now 21 Christian Oliver how about the seven footer showing you the range well if youre K brought us you like what you see out of your guys theyre not hanging their heads theyre trying to just chip away at this thing and gain some confidence in the second 20 minutes pretty nice feed there from Groves to Dun could not connect from is on dou points s rebounds another back to back itss F jorgia Cavaliers a little flat footed at the defensive end bman into the pted turn as good as gold Reid steady you can always count on them and thats who you go to when you need a basket they had gone two and a half minutes of this second half without scoring bman takes it upon himself and you hope that that that offense can now turn into good defense 11th turnover forced by this Virginia Defense one of the best in the country great feed finish not there but Groves was foul hell go to the line nice job by grov just stepped in front of that Morgan State Defender had a size Advantage just not a lot of resistance the only thing Lawson could do was fouling that one rattles out for Groves as you get set to ring in the New Year on Sunday well have a womens basketball quadruple header right here on accn that starts at noon Eastern its 21st ranked Florida State hosting wake and then number 14 Notre squares off against Syracuse followed by 19th rank Louis taking on the canes and we cap the day with third ranked NC State and Virginia we wish everyone a Happy New Year a big one coming up here on the lady side as good as it is on the mens side its equally that good on the womens side in ACC play another turnover for steny State Westmore has himself yet another Dynamite Squad in to the jpj this season not mistaken they are the wolf Packer undefeated at 11 and0 to your point should be one heck of a game here three ball launch there you go and finally Isaac mcne sees one drop thats got to feel good for the sophore well he caught that in Rhythm his hands were ready the pass was right on target turn around jumper hops Im telling you now if they can get Winston tabs back and you put Hobs Lawson and tabs that is a very very good back court in the Mak Ro lines one up too strong Morgan State cleans up the boards last year went seven and seven in conference play in the m had an opportunity to go to France for 10 days this off se but the injuries have been tough for bris in the rest of his group and thats what hurt him last year Isaac mcne one of the best Shooters in the country he struggled just a little bit not on that one hands were set caught it in rhym C still lead big well at the jpj youre going to have some stars that come to watch some of the best basketball in the country Chris Long former who great on the defensive side of the ball then you got Scott Carlo Williams taken in the game and a little side note there for car Carly Williams a Terri director of Athletics spent many years at University of Georgia but Ed Scott the deputy ad he hired Kevin Rus at Morgan State when he was the athletic director Ill be proud of watching Bean finish through the cont go to the line for one more watch it again hes signals for the law but the pass came really in the right area finished with contact there and talking to to Kevin brus both he and Ed Scott were together at Binghamton many years ago Ed Scott is there he is on the right again Deputy ad at the University of Virginia he will be an athletic director again at a power five also told Tony Elliotts been walking around taking in the game here tonight as well Virginia head coach on the football set its been a complete performance another turnover forced thats something Virginia can rely on as beakman putting his man into motioning him up kick out M got one this that time to open three missed everything for the Bears theres a long way to go for the Bears to fight back but boy a terrific Inside Out pass by Udu speaking of great passes be ripped away though just the fourth turnover for Virginia here tonight A team that has protected the basketball Tony Bennett feels like most years thats what made last week so different as a three ball goes down for Lawson but 18 turnovers against the Tigers for Virginia uncharacteristic and Memphis really made him pay Penny hards got a good group Dean I mean thats a thats going to be a tough out a team that can make a Deep Run in the NCA tournament as well theres no doubt about it some may say you know that conference isnt power five that program is every bit of power five or power six if you consider the Big East in college basketball Memphis has three straight ranked victories for the first time since 2008 you might remember what they did that year with Derrik Rose Memphis handed Clemson their only loss this year the tigers having a terrific season at n and one first free throw goes down do want to remind you that tomorrow bu Mania rolls on right here on accn with command center broadcast of the Bad Boy Mowers pin stri at Yankee Stadium between Miami and ruter at 215 Eastern and the poptarts bowl at 545 Eastern with NC State squaring off against Kansas State youll get multiple game angles with real time player and team stats throughout both games you got to love those bowl game sponsors I love to see it every year as they some stay the same but others change love the games themselves Dean I dont know how easy it was to read all of those in the promos a mouthful good ball movement Mick NE knocks down his second triple of the half and thats what were talking about right previous possession not so good great Shooters have short memories and thats exactly what mcne did right there he was in Rhythm they had good ball movement forced a long close out he was open and knocked it down Tony Bennett was candid he said teams have gotten physical with him theyre trying to run him off the line just trying to throw him off his game and the key now for us is how do we get mcne open how do we find ways to have off movement how do we attacks how does he get his teammates involved Hes A Marked Man Tony Bennett as bonds will go to the line well theres a couple of things he can do you know hes got to continue to take the breaks off that is run the floor hard and continue he cant stand great Shooters play with three lungs constant movement hes got to learn how to pop curl fade off of scen and then when the opportunity presents itself hes also going to be able to put it on the floor maybe not all the way to the rim but one or two dribbles to free himself for a midrange or to find others and he will he is a talented player I mean were talking about him as though hes had you know three or four bad games he just had one you know one for eight 0 for five behind the YK game in a really tough environment against a really good team in the Memphis Tigers at 12 Theses in two games shades of Kyle guy in those games so theyre going to try and continue to get Mi Ne going theres a foul on the floor well come back Virginia leading Virginia take it on Morgan State for the fifth time in program history heres what you need to know about the Bears the largest HBCU in Maryland you see the enrollment couple of Inca tournament appearances out of the m and known on the football side of things for having some Hall of Famers how about nine Time pro bowler Rosie Brown also a Charlottesville native and they honor Rosie here in Charlesville street named after him a lot of great football for the Bears guys like Lenn Ford Leroy Applause Kelly and you see Roosevelt Brown Jun born in in 1932 in Charlottesville but de a lot of good basketball at Morgan State as well theyre absolutely is I think many long time who followers know the name Marvin Webster the human eraser and and Clarence big house gains just a couple of the really really good basketball players great history here athletically for Morgan State pretty athletic block there of Le Bond dou team comes turn around jumper that goes down and coach Morgan States outscoring Virginia 173 here in the second half well theyve cut back on the turnover somewhat theyve had better spacing but I think for them its been its solid for the most part at the defensive end they have been better than they were in that first half where they allowed the Cavaliers really anything that they wanted the offensive end they shot 75 this half and stepping ining the muray straight bomb hes had seven points on a couple of occasions this season hes a good role player and I mean that respectfully for a guy like that kind of understands his role and plays it Applause well of the New Zealand national team is tane Murray HS from a his dad played for the All Blacks my guess is theres a little bit of toughness in there as well if theres any DNA passed along fre thr line Jing Applause alive muray no again to do it himself OPP for Virginia state doget right making himself known here in these in these minutes in the second half couldnt get it to go down but came back defensively ran in transition ran to the paint defended appropriately just couldnt come up with a steal but got the deflection you can a top 80 consensus recruit we talk about the youth of this Virginia team in the two losses that theyve had theyve gone up against Wisconsin and Memphis who had a combined three under classment in their rotations and when you look at Virginia who weve shown you has six players they count on that are under classment was reading streaking the lawn which is a great ESP site that the Virginia has they do a phenomenal job but breaking down the youth that this Virginia team has and just how much room they have to grow youre hoping for a team that again peaks in February but theres Talent there and Tony Bennett knows it he said we got to be patient with them which is why we are focusing on quality basketball its not going to always be quantitative right where were not going to be able to sit there and say we need this many number of Ste or blocks or close outs or shot clock violations we are focusing on the fundamentals right now as we continue to get better and better well well said coach Bennett and step they love this team right and and for for good reason and they just need to put continue to put the pieces together to your point you cant lose almost 50 points a game in what they lost in game experience and points last year and expect things just to pick up where they left off when really Reese beakman is is the only guy with quality minutes but of these six youngsters that are playing three freshman three sophomores theyre going to be just fine long range again Morgan State continues to shoot lights out in this second half look at that number five of nine from Beyond The Arc a lot of that coming here in the second stands upman left short done closing in on a double double he couldnt follow the Bears pushing it a little bit more in the second half theyll be rewarded going to the line on the followup attempt there by 13 Trent Edwards he has flashed The Freshman from Lexington that 59g a packed house here in Charlottesville at the jpj one of the great venues in college basketball rebounding in area Dean that coach Bennett wanted to see his team take a step forward in he said we have struggled in that area especially in our losses so far tonight they have stepped up to the challenge they have you know but part of the problem is the competition is going to elevate when they get to the ACC and yes those numbers are trending in the right direction today but when you look at the numbers against their peers in the ACC offensive rebounds per game and defense rebounds per game theyre last in the ACC and coach Bennett knows that they they have the opportunity to collectively get better its not one or two guys it is everybody across the board is going to have to car the load this is going to have to be one of those years where you know they may have four or five guys that get four or five rebounds a piece they may not have one that gets double digits three ball knock down by Groves the nth for Virginia here tonight and Groves is a is a prime example 69 hes never been a great rebounder at least statistically at any the other stops at Eastern Washington and Oklahoma but he can go get you four or five in the minutes he plays itll be a jump ball possession arrow to Virginia well coach you mentioned it earlier right you cant just lose guys like Jaden Gardner Ben Vander Ki Clark Arman Franklin and you just dont miss a beat right this group is going to have to continue to jel and get better they dont have a lot of points coming back on the year and thats why in addition to ree they need some of these youngsters to step up but its been there in stretches big wins over Texas AM big win over Florida there have been flashes of what this group can do and that end result could be pretty nice I think youre exactly right you know theyve got some quality wins and and to some extent the ACC sets up about as well as you could ask for right theyll theyll begin playing next week at Notre Dame and then they come home to Louisville and while every conference game is a season undo itself you know you open with those two and then youve got some other home games sprinkled in I think its about all you could ask for at this point 62 38 Morgan State coach of three balls fallen for The Who tonight well they have been and thats a reason why theyve got this big lead against the holiday cheer for the here on the fast break cookies okay solid Choice there as Virginia leads big over Morgan state holiday time a chance for great Foods the desserts are always a fent Dean whats your favorite holiday dessert I dont think theres any question its my wifes Harvest cookies by the way Im going to have one right now whats in that I know I lost you at oatmeal and Crain its too good to pass oh my goodness well you cant go wrong with pean pie and vanilla ice cream I think that combination is a winner but Im glad youre enjoying your cookie Dean no doubt about that one Ill stop eating now and well get back to the game Virginia leading Morgan going stay Applause big six minutes plus left to play and if youre Tony Bennett you want your guys to finish as strong as you started right you dont want any dip here in the last six minutes you want to feel good about this performance overall defense to finger Applause on Theo had a great holiday love this time of year bull season more importantly we are in just the throws of college hoops and Im just less than a week away from all conferences really getting into to League Play not a better time of year and McNeely right he continues to to look for that open shot couple of substitutions coming out of the break there Tony Bennett wanting to get Jordan Miner into the game along with Elijah gerud and as mentioned before that last time out its important that the Cavaliers stay aligned and stay consistent and true to their defensive and offensive principle right here in the last four plus minutes late in the shot clock that doesnt fall itll stay Morgan State ball we talked about Jordan Miner in the first half transfer from maram was the coplayer of the year mark my word hes gonna hes going to hes going to make his Mark in ACC play it may not be over the course of the 20 game schedule but theres going to be some games where hes going to be called upon and he will step up nice layup and the Finish 66 to 40 yeah unfortunately Kevin brus just couldnt apply really the pressure that he wanted to we saw some glimpses in the first half because of a limited bench its been tough sledding for the Morgan State Bears against this Virginia Cavalier team now double figures hes got Virginia approaching 70 points bond out of position on that play one of the few mistakes the Cavaliers have made in the second half well finish it up in just a minute reactions from coaches and players well Dean going to be interesting man who you picking in that one H so Im an to L of Florida State not ashamed to say it uh thats going to be difficult for the nlls though with all the players that have opted out it seems like its close to about 70 of the starters uh it would have been up B without Jordan Travis even if everyone had opted in I think this is going to be difficult but well see this is a chance for Florida State I do think if you win changes things uh perception wise but you know what it is what it is it has been a tough season for FSU uh after going undefeated essentially got told that their regular season didnt matter whether you agree with the The Pick of B over the NS or not or Texas getting in you did tell a college football team that their regular season had no meaning and I think thats thats tough thats tough as an Alum to to hear its tough for those kids who put in Blood Sweat and Tears and quite honestly its not fair and I think its bad for sports but were here to talk Virginia Morgan State I wont get into a diet tribe on that I will be in attendance uh for the NES and the dogs having to do my football radio duties with uh Florida State but uh well see what Tony Elliot can do here with Virginia get a couple of wins a big one over North Carolina and hopefully something positive to build on into next year for The Who on the grid iron yeah well said back to the Orange Bowl as a former Georgia Tech basketball assistant my heart lies with the Ramblin wck so I dont know that I can root for the bullog and in anything theres no hatred on my part but Ive got a cheer for FSU and in particular what you mention what what happened or didnt happen speaking Tech how about ke the he did off with a B win they over UCF I think the rambling re got something to be proud of as they move forward into year two for him well said great Energy Great staff and and I think on the mens basketball side of things I think Damon stms got something going on blend of some old some transfers and even newcomers VI and Dango 69ine freshman has been Rookie of the Year twice now in ACC nonconference play Jumper goes down 72 44 its been a great holiday season in the ACC want to shout out my family as well coming all the way from London from the United Kingdom Angel we love you and these who as they move into the new year a lot to be proud of a lot to build on El talented to5 consens recruit Tony bennes what this is going to bring to the table as he continues to mat they burned his redirt this season coach theyre hoping that he can end up being a big contribut for them in that rotation and he certainly will much like Ryan done an elite athlete and thats even with the his senior year in high school because of that injury to Dante Harris as you said they lifted the red shirt prior to that November 29th game when the Cavaliers played and beat Texas AM here at John Paul Jones always good when you can get deep into your bench fans are happy to see Tristan how to the game the senior hes from Virginia Beach 42 as well Bryce Walker there you go theres trist how getting into the scor column and why not you know why why look to pass it minute to go you got a 15 footer at the elbow go ahead and take it big fella Dean whats impressed you most about Virginia here tonight as they put a ribbon on nonconference play and move into the new year in AC play well really the only true negative was just five of 11 from the free throw line and theyre just over 50 if my math is correct in the last three games so you know I think thats an area weve talked a lot about the rebounding piece but they they showed some good things defensively they showed some good things offensively and so I think if youre Tony Bennett you saw enough to be happy and get that bad taste out of your mouth after that loss 8 days ago to Memphis but again it cant be overstated and after 15 years Bennett knows things things are for real starting next week when you travel to Notre Dame or I should say later this weekend Notre Dame Louisville NC State first three games you got a chance I think to start with a bang if youre Virginia and into conference action nice Outlet pass Miner Euro miss the lay the offensive rebound by they would love to see Walker get into the score jumper Walker it fly there it Applause isin of for the Cavaliers doesnt it my friend it de has a lot of tgia Ison and a blow of St
