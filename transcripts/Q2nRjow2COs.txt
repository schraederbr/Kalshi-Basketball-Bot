the three ball Hes shooting the three ball and making the three ball When that shot goes in he becomes a lot more difficult to guard On the other side keep an eye on MJ Russell the red shirt junior and the transfer from Mississippi State Hes having a fabulous season for the Warhawks Theyre three and seven Miami is 82 And thats how this one gets started today Ernest New Day Jr Not a bad way to start the game Off the tip one pass out of you Ernest New Day Jr Theyre averaging six points and a little less than nine rebounds per game So here comes ulm the Warhawks Theyve got 15 players from six different countries mixing and matching on this roster for first year head coach Phil Cunningham Down the rebound Malik Reu true Washington having a fabulous season brings it up the floor for Miami Heres Shelton Henderson the five star out of Texas gives Miami an early fourpoint lead I know coach Cunningham does not like that play This player came up from the close out He wasnt even by the defender I mean by the by it uh Shelton Shelton got by him and scored a two Got to play better defense especially to start the game Wide open three in the corner is left short by Saunders This is the second alltime meeting between Miami and ULM Their lone meeting November of 2003 in Las Vegas That was a 18point 78 to 60 victory for the Hurricanes I like the fact that that Trey is coming out being aggressive early Early in the season he wouldnt have shot that three He would have sworn the ball I like the way the fact hes being aggressive Donaldson averaging a little less than 15 points per game The transfer from the University of Michigan feeds it down low to Malik Rayu As easy as they come at 6 nothing Miami What a pass That was a double bounce pass Two bounces drop step dunk Great pass in transition First assists of the day for Trey Donaldson Nearly two minutes into this one and the Warhawks still looking for their first bucket Wide open down low is Broadnecks and that shot is left short Another one and done opportunity for ULM Here come the Kings again True Washington What a filthy move to the rack What a move That remind me of the Keon Dueling misdirection Bounce it left without going right Finish with the right Great finish by TR Nice start for Miami Jay Lucas had mentioned a couple of weeks ago when they had an early 1200 start He thought his team came out flat Not so much here today Theres a takeaway by Henderson Miami leads 8 nothing 2 and 12 minutes in and Shelton Henderson will go to the free throw line as Salunas gets set to check in for Miami About that feed and assist from Trey Donaldson What a pass I mean coming down eyes up and the thing is Malik had position early Thats the key Making your position and get your position early so you can get an easy basket Shelton Henderson to the free throw line makes the first A 51 free throw shooter this season is Shelton Henderson Theres Sali Alt Tunas He checks in for the Canes Well thats one thing you want to see better with this Miami basketball team is free throws Especially a guy like Shelton Henderson that gets downhill that gets fouled a lot You want to see him make his free throws Miami coming into this game today just a 66 free throw shooting team on the season as Shelton Henderson misses the second So nine nothing Kings and thats a foul on Alt Tunas about 10 seconds into his outing The freshman out of Turkey Salunas 610 275 lbs its a big boy right there Yes ULM still looking to get on the scoreboard Broad necks works to the free throw line Extended kicks it back out Now driving hard with the left hand throwing it up and off the glass as Rainar Saunders Its a great move by Rainar getting to the basket but hes got to get back on defense Now Tutas with his first bucket of the day Makes it 11 to2 ULM have won two of their last three Yeah its a nice feed up top Great pass Looked like a jump shot Lost his man back to her finish Warhawks coming off a victory against Arkansas Baptist Its a 7969 victory And theres a turnover Great defense Another replay of the alleyoop up top Lewis to Broad Necks Great play Great finish And three is good Rainar Saunders who had 10 points seven rebounds two blocks his last time out against Arkansas Baptist has quickly made it just a fourpoint game On the other end Malik Reu has that roll in and out but an offensive rebound down and collected by Trey Donaldson Teimo Malovich into the game now for Miami Heres Alunas Left hand floater missed everything Oh this is a prime example of basketball is all about a game of runs You know Miami came out 10080 lead and now the games 119 Alex Malvie with a shot fake out behind the perimeter and got himself all the way to the bucket on the left side Its 11 to nine Its a 70 run over the last minute for the Warhawks and Ray News got an easy layup down low Now you watch this basketball game Miami is scoring a little bit way too easy Got to set your aggressiveness early especially if youre on the road ULM thankful Jack Theyve started to chip into this thing a little bit No travel Russell had that knocked out of his hands Baseline drive and a kick out Three in the corner No good Malik Reu went up and over Saunders to collect the rebound Shelton Henderson to a wideopen Trey Donaldson for three Rolled in and out Foul on the floor That is going to be on Teemo Malovitz Thatll send us to our first TV timeout of the afternoon Nice start here See him out here tonight Well his Warhawks off to a three and seven start this season But I would venture to guess what youre telling me is thats a great great addition to this team for ulf Great addition great recruiter Look at them to do some big things in the next couple years Warhawks have gone off the canvas and now they trail by a pair If you look at that last play you know the Warhawks play off a lot of DHOss DHO is a dribble handoff They run their offense with a lot of those You can get very creative with that basketball option And MJ Russell had the bucket Hes got nine games or 10 plus points this season Miami responds and the lead is back to four Reu three of four from the field Hes got six early points for Miami Balls on the floor Malovitz is on it Thats a jump ball and itll remain Warhawks basketball Heres the last look here at that dribble handoff See the the great play with the dribble handoff You can keep it So he was going over for the dribble handoff kept it and kept going Its a very decisive play in basketball I love that Thats and thats a guy MJ Russell We highlighted him a touch in the open mentioned his name the red shirt Junior and you spoke of Mississippi State Hes a transfer from Mississippi State Hes played some high caliber basketball and another great addition to this Warhawks team 100 He is not shy at this moment With a name like MJ Russell I think about Michael Jordan and Byron Russell Hes right on queue I dont know if you remember there was a time when Michael Jordan went in the playoffs went right pushed came back left Nothing but the bottom of the net So hes got Michael Jordan and Russell in his name Look for him to have a big game right now MJ Russell with five points The lead now down to one for Miami Theyre not playing bad but ulm has come out of nowhere Malik Ray News got eight You know if you watch this game theyre having a tough job you know rebounding and guarding the big man down low Russells got it Nearly had it poked away by Shelton Henderson Now Lewis will work off a high screen from Hartman Theres Russell Logo deep three Jack Mlinton territory back in the day He ties it at 17 MJ Russell He is ready to play and hes confident Hes Hes stepping right into his shot Not overthinking it Letting it fly 174 points per game Second of the SBC Hes got 17 plus in his last three and 15 points in eight of 10 games this season On the other end Trey Donaldson with the answer Great shot by Trey Missed his first two threes but hes not afraid to shoot the next one which is a great sign from your point guard When he scores it definitely gets the team going a lot faster The 15th made threepointer of the season for Trey Donaldson That was swatted away by Malovitz And now hes got the basketball open down low off the glass Shot no good by Rayu Collects his own rebound Puts it back up and in Hes pat uh kind of patting his stats here early huh 10 points It looks like it a little bit but its great transition offense by the Kings Shot goes up they get the rebound and theyre pushing it down the court You want to see the Hurricanes score early in basketball games with 10 points three bound three rebounds excuse me for Malik Renu Lead back to five for Miami Now Lewis dribbling between his legs working on Malovich Step back three Had it blocked Nothing good happens when youre pelling the ball and trying to get to your shot Nothing good ever happens You got to take three four dribbles to get into a shot You should probably pass the ball Ernest Uday fouled on his way up to the rim Hell go to the free throw line when we come back Kings leading by five Might get out of hand quickly but the Warhawks snapped out of an early multiminute funk and they trail by five as Ernest Uday Jr Well go to the free throw line coming out of our second TV timeout Just six of 19 now six of 20 from the free throw line this season season Shooting right around 30 from the charity stripe Again this has been an issue for this team all year long You know it seems like a small thing but its such a big thing especially for new programs If you want to win late in March you got to make your free throws U misses both So it remains a fivepoint lead for Miami Got caster broad necks Saunders ball in Russell on the floor for ULN Here is Russell Shes got unlimited range He bombed one up a couple of minutes ago from the logo inside of the orange and he buried it Shot clock winding down Three on the way is left short by Saunders Miami collects the rebound Trey Donaldson slashing all the way into the paint True Washington having a fabulous season misses the three but Ernest Uday is there for the rebound A feisty rebound of the offensive variety for Ernest Uday Jr and now Trey Donaldson wants a screen swings it into the corner for Malovitz and down low wide open is U Thats a great play You know it looked like Teemo had nowhere to go Udy did a great job of meeting him where hes supposed to be You drive that baseline you got to have somebody right there to follow up for you Four points for Ernest Dudday Jr Hes a 79 shooter from the field this season I mean everything is down low right around the bucket Noam Dre into the game for Miami True Washington laid that up for Ernest Duday Jr He had to work hard for that one It was not a very good pass but hes so big and strong He was able to collect it and finish I love to see U get going early on the offensive end you know what youre going to get from him on defense and rebounding but when hes going offensively this is a totally different University of Miami basketball team And that was swatted away by Dotten Doat End of the game for Miami Nearly carried it Heres Drew Washington slicing and dicing throwing it up He was fouled Well see who the fouls on And the guilty pardon going to be Micah Caster the sophomore out of Macintosh Alabama You know I like that play by True for being aggressive to the paint But as this team continues to grow you want to see True get a paint touch collapse the defense and kick out the Trey If you look at this last play Trey was wide open in the corner I think thats something that them as a point guard and shooting guard they have to have a conversation because when the game starts to get on the line and the games matter against better teams you got to make that extra pass Hes been pretty good from the free throw line this season 23 of 30 76 free throw shooter A junior guard out of Phoenix Arizona Misses the first Now Jack heres another guy in true Washington I mean hes done a fabulous job I dont know if many folks thought he was going to provide what he has but hes been a very integral piece to this team this season Yeah for sure Someone like True I call him a bucket getter Put him in the court put him on anything give him assignment tell him go get a bucket He was going to make that happen And every basketball team needs a guy that can just go get a bucket Miami once again struggling from the free throw line today Another pair missed Theyre now one of six from the free throw line Little bit of defensive pressure here from the Canes The lead is back to nine Theyre on a 90 run over the last four minutes and 30 seconds Now Ball will handle the basketball way out near half court for ULM Good look from Saunders Russell down low had it blocked collects it misses Doat with a rebound Great play Great defense And now Malik new high flying Malik is sneaky athletic Hes a quick jumper You know hes might hes not the most athletic although he is but hes such a quick leaper that it makes him seem like hes more athletic than what he is Great finish by Malik now spinning and throwing it up there as Caster fired a dart off the backboard Drew Washingtons flo and the lead balloons to 13 for Miami Phil Cunningham will call a timeout 835 left to play in the first half Malik Ray music knew has been a godsend for the Kings this season Lucky lefty Hadre shout out to my guys Everybody plays their part Congratulations to Mario Crystal Ballal and his football team They will take on the TexasM Aggies next Saturday at High Noon in College Station Texas Thatll be a fun one Any predicting thatll be the best first round college football matchup You on the sidelines for that one You get whatever you want here if you want You know sometimes you know it depends You know I got a baby you know Shout out my baby Hampton my fiance It depends on she lets me go She lets me go I might be there I dont think so either laughter Another timeout This one of the TV And the beautiful thing in college sports these days is you can kind of rebuild and reload quickly Uh you need some funds to do it The Hurricanes have got it Theyve got an energized first year head coach Some kids playing in their last season coming back to their home state here in Florida So that recipe has led to success here early Theyre literally playing for the name on their chest right That is the recipe to success Shout out Quinn Cook in the cookbook He has a book out called Quinn Cook His recipe to success Russell down low Corkcrews himself underneath the basket and he lays it up and in off the glass Great move by Russell I should call him MJ right now That was a little up and down there A little reverse Theres more NJ MJ to Bobby Russell Great finish Drew Washington straightaway three Left it short Malovitz sent the offensive rebound Now Dovat fires way too strong Look at the Warhawks now changing their defense up Theyre going to a two3 zone forcing Miami to shoot the basketball Quick trigger three Good That was buried by Saunders And now Miami will take a timeout Jay Lucas has been barking at his players for the last minute Were supreme ballers over there Look for him to continue to be aggressive continue to knock down shots Shout out Ria Great basketball team in Europe That three rolled in and out for Doat Malik Reu tried to collect the offensive rebound would have but he was fouled Foul is on Bisili the red shirt sophomore out of Nigeria We talked about this early too 15 players from six different countries for first year head coach Bill Cunningham which is pretty cool as well as right is blocked I mean if you look at a lot of college programs look at the Illinois program a lot of Europeans on the basketball team I believe a lot of college teams are adopting this method of let me get some Europeans on my team I believe they develop a little bit faster than American basketball and youre seeing it while a lot of teams are getting these European basketball players who ready to who are ready to play right away Five points now for Shelton Henderson after the dunk And Vanasili doing a lot of dribbling Not going anywhere But Russell finds him wide open down low He finishes in Hell head to the free throw line as well And Malik Ray knew in disbelief he was caught for that foul Great play Great movement by the Warhawks Theyre really getting the ball out moving the basketball Heres a look at the and one Basicili the transfer from Utah big time power four program cheering last power four win for the Warhawks when they beat Iowa in 2007 This is their first time playing an ACC opponent since 2012 when they traveled to Tallahassee to take on the Florida State Seinals Rayu finishes with a left hand Thats great offense by University of Miami Keep the ball moving The ball really didnt touch the floor Find a cutting Renew finish Nothing but the bottom of the net Little bit of glass first A little over five minutes left to play here in the half Lewis had that swat of the way Shot clock is at four down to three DIAZ BOMBS ONE UP AND HE ROLLS it in Those are tough when its a broken play loose ball guy makes a three Those are tough tough shots to make and its tough on the defense First shot of the day for Dylan Diaz makes his eighth threepointer of the year And Shelton Hendersons triple try doesnt go but another offensive rebound for the Canes Heres Malik Reu No whistle Rolls out of bounds Itll remain Miami basketball Heres that dire three by Diaz Those are the best shots You catch and shoot right away You dont have time to think about what youre doing Thats the most natural shot in basketball You catch and shoot Its a reason why its a term catch and shoot Thats the best way to let the ball fly Warhawks have made their last four shots from the field and theyre back to within seven Miamiys led the entire way here today but theyve had some pretty big leads start to evaporate as Shel Henderson finishes Hes got seven Its a great finish Straight downhill a little shoulder bump with the right and finish with the left Pump fake Heres Lewis Russell Lost had it poked away by Henderson Look at the tight defense by Shelton Henderson Now fade away jumper is good Wow MJ Russell He looked like MJ a little bit on that one If you notice that he stayed composed Shelton put some body on him He stayed composed A little bit of body Little dirt fade away Nothing but net Great shot by MJ Russ Very impressed by this kid Yeah A little bully ball on the other end for Malik Renu But the thing is ulm has to get a stop Theyre scoring and then giving up a a basket right away They got to get stopped They want to be in this basketball game Now a finish by Broadnecks Another foul by Malik Reu Yeah The thing thats happening is one team scores another team scores The team that was going to win this basketball game was going to lead this basketball game the team that gets stops ULM scores they allow Miami to come back and score And its vice versa You got to get stops to win basketball games 3832 Its a sixpoint difference right now Broadnecks completing that unconventional threepoint play Now they go up top for Ernest New Day Jr Beautiful find and look from Trey Donaldson Thats a great play DHO dribble handoff to get Trey coming downhill Big Earnest rolls to the basket for Ali MJ Russells got it Leads all Warhawks with 12 points here in the first half headed right towards his season average or maybe then some today There is Russell being guarded by Malovich Little double team taken away by Donaldson Now a twoonone and an opportunity Malovitz couldnt finish Had it blocked Great defense by ulm Terrific transition defense to get back and block Malivitz Thats a winning basketball play And thats also winning basketball play by Trey Donaldson Lets go back a couple plays ago Here was the alleyoop and find by Donaldson for Ude who kind of collected it initially with one hand Thats a great play If you look at the DHL dribble handoff from Teemo if he doesnt see Ernest he can throw back to Teemo for three Thats a great basketball play drawn up by Jay Lucas Lead is back to eight High screen Trey Donaldson wide open look for three Missed it Another offensive rebound collected by Miami A very patient Drew Washington lays it up and in Thats great pace Its great pace by True Gets in the paint looks left looks right sees nobody stops him Finishes off two Nothing but the bottom of the net I know I keep saying it but its hitting a lot of rim But it just sounds good 21 rebounds to nine in favor of Miami Eight of those 21 offensive Oh that three is good by Diaz Its his second threepoint attempt Its the second one hes made And now hes got a chance to complete a fourpoint play Its happening once again The vibrational frequency of this basketball game is make two give up three make two give up two This game is still close and its still a basketball game Boy if the Warhawks could cut down on Miami second chance points theyve got eight second chance points eight offensive rebounds chance theyd be winning this game right now But Dylan Diaz averaging six points nearly seven points a game misses that free throw Hes got a pair of threes made here in the first half So the lead back to seven Henderson popped in kicked it out for Washington who had it tripped away but a foul is called Jay Lucas chatting with Jeffrey Clark By the way the officials today Jeffrey Clark Telen Miller and Joe Schwitzer He was chatting with Jeffrey Clark because after the whistle blew Shelton Henderson got tangled up with one of the Warhawks and Jeffrey had gone over to Shelton Henderson and said Hey knock it off Once the whistle blows the play is over Yeah thats one guy I dont want to get tangled up with is Shelton Henderson Changing the foul to number three Christian Lewis Five fouls by both teams here in the first half Warhawks their last seven attempts from the field of all the bottom of the net 4235 Miami leads Shelton Henderson bullying his way in down low For a freshman hes not passive Hes not passive at all He is very tenacious Sure Looks like his Kchilles is bothering him a little bit Might need to get him out the game right now Oh boy Oh boy This is potentially really bad news for Shelton Henderson of the Miami Hurricanes Oh no Henderson is down He was fine after the finish but something happened on the defensive end You know whats crazy when you think about Achilles injuries Thats an injury that happens when it doesnt seem like theres a lot of contact something thats not big happening Hopefully Shelton comes up hes okay But every time I see an Achilles injury you never really see any contact or anything major happening Oh boy If this is noncont and an injury for Shelton Henderson it could be debilitating And he is not putting any pressure at all on the lower part of his left leg My goodness Heres a heres a look at the replay Well whatever it is its noncont and he starts to grab it there above the threepoint line Jack you saw it immediately And uh Henderson not able to put any pressure on that left foot right now Theyre going to take him right back to the locker room for some imaging and just a disaster for the Hurricanes And theres really no way to put that lightly Now its time for other players in Miami to step up The broad necks hit the deck Not enough contact there to draw the foul They tried to get the ball down low to Alunas whos going to set a high screen for Donaldson There they find him Heres Malovitz wide open look in the corner No good And Drew Washington had it He had it swatted away by Lewis So it stays Miami basketball Its a very very important defensive play by UNL They need to come out here and get a stop going into the half Little trickery by Trey Johnson throwing it off his back Remember a couple of years ago in the NCAA tournament Wuka Popppler did that I believe it was against Texas late in the second half Thats one of those things that you never think its going to happen but its open a lot of times when people dont do it Great play by Trey True vet move Yeah its already the second or third time hes done it this season Well 4635 now Miami beating ULM But its its its hard Jack to not think about what we just saw with Shelton Henderson One of the best fivestar prospects in the country Uh has apparently suffered a noncont injury here today Could not put any weight at all on his left foot and moments ago taken back to that Miami locker room Well we wont speculate Well see if theres any official word Theres a foul and with 1 second left to play here in the half You know not in the bonus So theyll have a baseline out of bounds play here You know its tough to see a guy so much potential having a great season go down like that But it also goes down to your team How are they going to respond to something major like that happening to a player Inbounds the true Washington At the buzzer he buries a three And thats how Miami will go into the half A 49 in the half and a little less than four rebounds a game So the two stars that we suspected would play some key pivotal roles here today have as were back underway Thats what you want to see Your top players got to perform like a top player and theyre doing that True Washington begins the second half with a lob for Ernest Uday who couldnt reel it in See what adjustments Phil Cunningham makes at halftime as MJ Russell had that swatted away at the batboard Now Rayu double teamed and he throws it away and Jay Lucas not happy Thats a tough play You know you got Malik he got the ball almost at the top of the threepoint line Hes very effective going downhill when hes catching the ball in the paint Not saying hes not comfortable doing that but you saw he went baseline with nowhere to go Jump pass nowhere to pass the basketball but he got the black on defense Cant be mad at Malik right there Jack I know we were talking about Shelton Henderson before we went to commercial break to begin this second half We did show Shelton on the baseline near Miamis bench working out which is extremely encouraging considering what we saw in terms of a noncont injury towards the end of the first half We do have official word from the university The only thing they are saying is he wont return You do want to speculate a little bit if you know if you thought maybe it was an Achilles It would appear as if its not considering the way he was working out So thats probably the best case scenario right now for Miami as Malik Rayu finishes Yeah best case I mean you never know I mean one thing you can see it right now Well see how he feels when he wakes up in the morning Great pass great finish by Malik Got it right back Thats where hes effective in the paint finishing off two 16 points and six rebounds for Malik Reu who portaled to Coral Gables from Indiana A wide open three is buried by Rainar Saunders He had 10 points seven rebounds and a pair of blocks in the Warhawks last game against Arkansas Baptist That was a victory You know if you think about the name Rainar Saunders it sounds like its like an American name but its actually spelled R E N A R S Sunders S O N D O R S He sounds like an American but this guy is from Latia and you could tell with that stroke hes letting the ball fly with supreme confidence Not his first time at the rodeo shooting the basketball Saunders 11 points four of seven from the field I think they just got Rayu for that last foul And if its on Ray New thats his third Hes gonna have to take a seat youd think cheering And the first free throw is good for Broad Necks Hes got six points now today The foul was on Renu So thats three but Jay Lucas is going to keep him on the floor Yeah you got to you got to have some confidence in your your upper classman Got to make sure he plays hands up not getting foul trouble but its a sevenpoint game I dont know if you could take him out right now These two teams set in the game back about a hundred years from the free throw line today Everything else has been pretty good New kicks it out Trey Donaldson three from the wing He buried it Just the third made threepointer of the day for Miami Theyre now three of 12 from beyond the arc Great shot by Trey I dont know if you saw the last play but Lewis made the laugh and threw it at Trey Trey wasnt feeling it Thats why he came back down gave him a couple claps to the face And now Broadnecks misses the wideopen layup Look Here is Teimo Malovitz for three That knuckle ball is buried Great play Great driving kick cheering You if you watch Trey Trey gets to the paint and he passes the ball back out Thats what you want to see with your guards on the basketball team Get a paint touch Try to get an open shot from your teammate And thats what Treys doing An amazing job Miami had two threes in the first 20 minutes in the first half Theyve got a pair back to back in the first two minutes and 30 seconds to begin the second 20 minutes And now driving towards the bucket Lewis he misses Still not a single offensive rebound for ulm today as Drew Washington misses at the rim A little bit of tempo now Three on the way That is good for Lewis Thats his second three of the day You dont want to see a missed opportunity and the Warhawks come down and hit a threepoint shot like Noom Doves gone to the scores table for Miami set to check in True Washington with the bounce pass down low to Ernest Uday He was fouled by Renar Saunders Doats going to check in for true Washington Balon Saunders was his second You know this is the opportunity for Dorat to come in and get some extra time as Sheltons on the bench You want to show coach coach you can trust me in big time circumstances You can trust me to come in and make plays for our basketball team And Teemo Malovich left wide open from three Cannot leave Teemo Irving open Shout out to Michael Irvin number 88 TMo is shooting the ball with supreme confidence right now Well hes also coming off a game for Miami in which they beat Southern Miss 88 to 64 He scored 13 of a season high 16 points in the second half and he buried four triples That three missed but the first offensive rebound of the day He belongs to the Warhawks into the hands of Malib Theres a flush for MJ Russell I didnt know MJ Russell was that athletic Great finish great back door cut Do it right You got to see your man involved at all times ULM hanging around as Rayu kind of throws one up near the rim Missed everything And now U bangs into Broad Necks and Uday is going to get charged with a foul Its his second So Rayus got three Hes going to be very consistent You know eight points couple assists You know what youre going to get from Trey Thats what you want from your point guard You want to have a consistent dynamic to every time he steps on the court And thats what you see in Trey Donaldson Inbounding the basketball is Lewis to Russell Collects it and a foul and lets see who its on It is on Ernest Duday So now both he and Malik Reu have three personal fouls a piece They got to be careful there Lewis baseline inbounds once more Now Noomats going to get called for a foul You know theres a lot of time in this game and if you look at the score its only an 11point game This is anybodys ball game right now Pair of quick fouls there by Miami That was knocked away Its going to roll out of bounds And now back down on the other end is where the Warhawks will have the basketball We had 14 seconds left on the shot clock Having a hard time getting anything set up here between the fouls and the tip passes So now eight on the shot clock Lewis swings it now in the corner Russell Great pass Pass Easy look down low for Broadicks Too short Heres Trey Donaldson Coast to coast and a left hand finish Great finish Transition You got to stop the ball early Now Miami jumps into a two3 zone defense Russell almost traveled And Malafi buries a three on the wing in the corner Come on man another European Moscow Russia cannot leave these guys open In the Euro League right now or what Give him a little bit of clearance and theyre ready for takeoff from beyond the arc MJ Russell no whistle lost it on the way up Russells got it back being guarded by Malovich Good defense screaming Shot clock at five Dribble drive into the paint towards the rack and laying it up and in is Lewis Hes got 10 Lewis is having himself a great basketball game right now Hes taking on the challenge playing against Tradies and hes meeting him head on Now Trey Donaldson wide open deep three is good Great shot by Trey Look at his shot now Hes catching and not overthinking it Earlier in the season he was catching it holding thinking about and shooting Now hes stepping right into it and letting it fly Thats the fifth made threepointer for Miami here in the second half after they had two in the first half alone They stay in that two3 zone defense just tempting the Warhawks to shoot it from deep And Malifi triple try no good A little short now Trey Donaldson pulls up again for three and he missed it You know what we call that We call that a heat check Three and he marries it Thats six threepointers in the second half for Miami Phil Cunningham not happy Miss where he just caught fire in the second half and it just uh kind of ballooned on Miami in a good way Thats what you want to see We talked about response and we talked about guys coming in and stepping up Miami shot two for 11 in the first half They responded to shooting six for seven in the second half You look at Teemo Shelton goes down for a little bit Teemo comes in shoots three for three Thats what you want to see in a basketball team that you look to see play basketball in March Five on the shot clock Saunders its winding down Hands it off Russell deep three Missed it short It was on target And now Sal Tutas has a rebound Beautiful look down low by Trey Donaldson As easy of a finish as they come for Sally Altunass got four points Its a great pass Great paint touch Its a little drop off Great catch Underrated catch by the big fella So now the lead is 19 and a straightaway three there That was on a line That was a line drive three And now Sally Alunas with the finish Man Trey has a gift and a knack for finding the right person and making sure the ball lands in the hands Look at some point guards He make their bigs have to kind of go find and catch the ball When Trey throws the ball for a pass it lands right in the hands of his teammates for easy baskets A corner three was no good but a finish and an offensive rebound for Broadicks whos got eight now Thomas Silly is going to check back in for ulm in a moment John Le Boy is at the scores table Hes ready to check in for Miami Kanes lead is 19 Second chance try no good Now rolling on the floor is Broadnecks and a tie up Itll be Warhawks basketball You know we talked about guys getting an opportunity JJ Boy this might be the earest hes ever gotten to a basketball game You want to music see him respond and play with confidence in the rest of this basketball game Hes coming in when we come back Miami lead baseline out of bounds coming out of the TV Timeout here for ULM again John Le boy I the second who plays very sparingly is into the game for Miami being asked to play some tightly contested defense John Le boy JJ Leo not to be staken for Justin Leo Three ball good there by Lewis Hes got 13 His third triple make of the day trying to get it down low to Malik Reu was thrown away Wow And a wild and crazy pass ends up in the hands of Ernest Uday whos going to go to the free throw line Not a whole lot Malik Reu could do It was not a very good bounce pass from Dovrad and Reu just threw it behind his back and it ended up in the lap of U I didnt meant to do that Look at that on target It was right there Got eyes in the back of his head Hes probably saying Ernis you got to make that for me Give myself an assist Had my second of the day And u misses the free throw Hes now 0 of three from the free throw line Miami having just a a disaster day again from the free throw line one of six and now two of seven You want to see them get to the line a little bit more as well Two for seven right now You know its amazing ULM in their last game attempted 41 free throws and made 31 of them Theyve only gone to the free throw line five times today Free throws win basketball games Getting to the line making equally as important Thats a heck of a job there by the Warhawks Russell with the three But just good quality team basketball there Great basketball play Whenever you driving baseline the opposite guy must go to the corner cuz that is your last resort Anybody watching basketball that knows basketball if you drive baseline you have to have a man in the opposite corner Doorat and Le Boy out Malovitz and Donaldson back in 7662 Miami leading 1015 left to play in the game And Malik Reu fouled by Broadnecks Thats his first team Third here in the second half Malik Renu with 16 points and eight rebounds Ernest Dude has got nine

Donaldson had that swat of the way Hell take it out underneath the basket Ray knew with the baseline drive Picks up his dribble Drew Washington trying to get in towards the cup He lost it But the rebound or I guess you could say U picked it up Now hes got himself a double double Unless theyre going to consider that a shot and a rebound and a bucket Well see One thing about Ernest Uday he always has his hands on the basketball No matter where its at hes always keeping that effort to get his hands on the ball to give his chance for his team to get an extra shot at the basket Yeah no shot credited to True Washington So now 11 points and 10 rebounds for U as ulm makes another three This games only a 13point lead Basketball is a game of runs You got to keep your foot on the pedal

three try missed everything Great defense by Miami Force a tough shot force an air ball Thats what you want to see on the defensive end You can tell Russell is gassed too Played nearly this entire game Now Washington bullies his way into the paint and he lays it in off the glass Drew Washington with 13 points So four of the five Hurricanes on the floor right now in double digit scoring today Malovichs the only one that hasnt scored 10 or more Hes got nine Hes made three second half threes Bombasili floats one up and misses Oh and that was might have been off the hands of Malovitz Little luck on that basketball play right there A little luck Donaldson works his way in Malik Reu for three and he miss Ernest Uday collects the offensive rebound gets fouled Hell go back to the free throw line There he is again Second chance points for his basketball team One thing about love about Ernest hes played 23 here today Hes coming off a ninepoint performance against Southern Miss last time out Missed that Great rotational in the ball Look to see his his fingertips point down to the ground Look at his free throw His fingertips are pointing at the basket You want to see those fingertips point down to the ground And he missed them both Big guys have a hard time from the free throw line for whatever reason Thats the difference from the ones that stick and the ones that dont Yep Lewis looking for an open man Gets it right back from Bamasili Sets a high screen Little pick and roll Lewis to Diaz Open in the corner for three Rattled in and out Us got another rebound Thats number 14 Big day now true Washington One thing about True he is great getting the balls downhill Not a lot of move to get to where he has to go One little jab step off the dribble Finish it with the left Strong move by True right there Jordan Key is into the game by the way for Miami wears number one in white in the corner guarding Broadck Lewis to Diaz And here is Broadneck Drive on Jordan Key A miss And another rebound for Uday This ones starting to get out of hand now What a beautiful look from TR Washington who actually turned around and started running to the other end and he thought U was going to finish it And now Washington fouls Russell He was so confident after his pass to Uday and it was beautiful but U was blocked Great pass Great helpside defense right there Nice block from behind by Broadneck So U will take a seat Timote Malovitz back into the game for Miami Still a lot of height on the floor for Miami with Malovitz and Alunats Little double team in the corner and a foul on Washington 556 to go Miami has shot over 50 in a game six times this season Theyre shooting 61 from the field today High efficiency High efficiency They lead the ACC in field goal percentage and theyre second in assists Theyve got 26 assists today That three is good for Saunders who just checked into the game Its his fourth made threepointer of the day Hes got 14 points MJ Russell leading the way for the Warhawks with 17 Here goes Trey Donaldson He finishes with the left hand Great play You know one thing when you look at Trey hes very very good with getting his shoulder low and getting downhill absorbing the contact and finishing over bigger guys Heres Diaz wide open Look from Lewis is good Miami gets it out quick Back on the offensive end Drew Washington got a screen from Malovitz and now Donaldson gets one from Altunas Baseline drive wide open Jordan Key He missed Foul on the floor Its on Miami and its on Si Altunas Jordan Key was right there at the rim Little finger roll head off the back of the iron Great paint touch by Trey Great no look play That fell out of his hand a little bit too early Yeah I dont think Jordan thought he was going to be that wide open When you get there you got to finish your breakfast You come into the game you got to make those layups cheering Christian Lewis makes the first of his one and one opportunity So a second freebie coming up and he made them both Lewis has got 14 points Four of the five Warhawks on the floor right now have also scored 10 plus today Again Russell leading the way Seven of 14 from the field with 17 points Alique Reu wide open Malovichz Hes getting into his groove You know earlier in the season I think he was kind of second guessing the shots pump faking trying to get to the basket Right now hes receiving the ball and hes shot ready The ball gets in his hand hes letting it fly What a weapon he could become conference play Thatll be on December 30th for Miami here at home against Pittsburgh Spinning was broad necks He missed and Malik Reu collected the rebound He said Look out boys I can play point guard too Got his man off his feet Couldnt finish the dunk He was fouled Hell go to the free throw line Reu 16 points nine rebounds today Maybe should have been 10 after that last miss on the offensive end for ULM believe he should have a double double First free throw is good Has great great form on his shot Great elbow placement Great follow through He has a beautiful looking shot 94 points for Miami And give them 95 with over four minutes to go They scored a 100 plus in backtoback games on November 6th and the 10th against Pathoon Cookman and Stson That was a little too short by Russell Tried to bank one in wasnt open and now Rayu turns it over Well go to break here on ACC Network after with 349 left to go Miami leads 9575 Well Miamis been really good all day long but Jack its been a bit of a tail of two halves from beyond the arc for Miami They just they cant miss from deep here in half number two You know its great to see that you know Miami is shooting the basketball with confidence Its not that theyre making music the shots its that theyre taking the shots because you got to take shots to make shots And to be able to play basketball in March I know I sound music very repetitive you got to be able to knock down threepoint shots And youre seeing that from the University Miami basketball team today Eight of 10 from three in the second half just two of 11 in the first half and Teimo Malovitz having another sensational second half on the heels of uh won Miamis last time out against Southern Miss Now Miami has eclipsed the century mark twice this season Theyve scored 99 points as well That was against Elon back on November the 20th Theyve got 95 points with 340 left to play And Lewis threw it up at the timeline and reeling it in was Broadicks Now he floats one up with a right hand and misses I like team step in that Let that ball fly Rayon with a dunk and a finish Great ball reversal Pick and roll Tball Hes made his last three four five threes You got to get a heat check Let that one fly Well thats what I would do Bombs away Bombs away Bombs over Remember that song Ive heard of it Was that last play Donaldson pick and roll Beautiful assist They got to get back to the drawing board Theres no help side defense for ulm right now Theyve been beat by this pick and roll with no help all day Do for three Thats 100 By the way Trey Donaldson 18 points four rebounds 10 assists Its an unbelievable day Talking about Renew with 20 and 10 Us got a double double Youve got 10 assists and youve got 21 points You you just youre contributing every time down the floor For sure Every possession making it play for yourself or somebody else Another foul by Alunas Thats his third Heres that last three Miamis got some shooters from beyond the ark many of which are of the European variety which is not much of a surprise the way the game is played overseas Shoot a lot of threes a lot of transition threes and these guys are catching the ball and shooting right away Theres no hesitation If you go back and watch some game film with this Miami basketball team early on this season a lot of guys were secondguessing shooting the basketball Like the days are over for Dovat and Ray New Trey Donaldson I thought his day was done but its not I know that felt good Hes like I got some more time to do work These are those type of games you know you want to get your stats up before ACC play starts Great game points assists steals Hes only got 18 He wants to get a couple more points Matt Levitz again No Donaldsons got it Le boy lefty three No good And a foul Whos this one on Boy Sally Alunas has a very difficult time Jack staying out of his foul trouble when hes on the floor That is an area that theyve got to get cleaned up Thats four personal fouls for a guy thats only played 14 minutes Yeah You know its one of those things where hes playing with his hands a lot instead of playing with his body getting to the ball before it gets to him Thats something you can you can correct though Its still early but you cant have that going in ACC play as you got to have depth in the front court One and one chance for Broad Necks whos got nine and he missed it Its only the ninth foul by Miami Wasnt that one in one or was there a viol Oh Alunas with a violation cheering Another miss and offensive rebound Seventh of the day for the Warhawks Tried to turn it into three Couldnt And heres a foul on Malovitz Double bonus try Keep it up after the foul by Teimo Malovitz You know although Miami is up by a lot right now I guarantee in the film session Jays going to bring this up and Sean Havseys guys are not rebounding the basketball right now Got to rebound the basketball and close this cheering game up make by Broadnicks now in double figures Take a look at the tail of the tape today Miami out rebounding ulm 45 to 24 Good contributions from Miami from their bench with 24 bench points 16 for the Warhawks They havent gotten a ton off the bench in terms of contributions this season but a little bit better today that they carry back home Oh DOAT no look pass into the corner for Malovitz who air ball the three Great pass No look pass Patrick Mahomesesque Was the last person I thought you would say but I see it He does throw that no look pass a lot Well not a lot Very frequently You know you could have said Magic Johnson Jason Kid I like to diversify a little bit I like that I like diversify the portfolio a little crossover I like that Ill give you that Ill give you that On the heels or of NFL Sunday right Thats right I like that What they got this week The Chiefs got you Oh no idea Theyre not playing that well this year No I think theyre done arent they No playoffs Dang Theyve done it great in the past They get a break this year Its all good What do you think about the twotone shoes Left orange shoe right green shoe Whats your thoughts on that Could be color blind Im not sure Does he know Doesnt matter You score a bunch of points I Id run it back If you dont change it up Yeah I think if he rocked those you got to come out and do something on the floor Score assist rebound play with energy Right Another no look pass by Drap Jordan Key fell over while dribbling on the baseline Thats his go Oh he loved that No look Thats not a Thats a tough pass A no look Two in a row That is not an easy pass Two in a row So Miami will improve to 9 and two on this season ULM will fall to three and eight Miamis next opponent music will be with you at 700 on Tuesday night for a cross town showdown between Miami and FIU Take away and a foul And Miami into the one and one bonus opportunity here Noam Doat will go to the free throw line Actually I misspoke earlier Miami has two noncon games remaining against FIU and North Florida before ACC play starts on December 30th ULM will go home Theyll host South Alabama And then the raging tags before a trip to Kansas State The little apple A pair of conference games coming up for Phil Cunninghams bunch as weve entered less than one minute to play Another very effective and off uh offensive day for Miami Again shooting 60 from the field They picked up the pace from beyond the arc in the second half and more stingy defense for the most part Im sure theres some stuff that Jay Lucas wants to clean up Uh but once again once it got out of hand maybe a defensive lapse here and there but all things considered a very good day for Miami And if youre Phil Cunninghams bunch you do lose to another power four team but what can you build off of Le boy spinning looking turned it over 15 seconds to play now another turnover No on got it and a foul A foul by Broadcks And Phil Cunningham looked at him like uh what was that Free throw Good I know Dras happy couple buckets and pair of free throws That should do it Well well see you back here on Tuesday Jack Any parting thoughts from this one I think Miami came out very very strong Look supremely confident They shot the ball extremely well You want to see them continue to shoot the ball well throughout the rest of
