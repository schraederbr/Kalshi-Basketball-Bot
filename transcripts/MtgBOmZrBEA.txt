in the home white and its Miami who controls the tip Trey Donaldson with it High screen from Renu Back to Renu Dives in the paint and hes tied up Well youre going to see a healthy dose of that Renu with that pick and roll Donaldson finds him perfectly But we watch this morning shoot around Pit will swarm Renew anytime he gets that basketball Able to force a turnover One of the things they want to do is keep Miami out of the paint In fact Miami the best in the country 46 points They get in the paint every game As you take a look at the pit starting five Demarco Miner is another guy who runs the show for them as theyre throwing it down as Barry Dunning Jr to start things off Dunning Jr is a slasher Hes explosive Hes got great hops and he knows how to finish at the 10 Another freshman going downhill The kick out the Donaldson spinning off the glass is no good Miner comes away with it Here comes the Panthers Good Panthers defense Really tough Donald tough Uh got Donaldson to take a tough shot in there Well contested Skip pass in the corner See Aleppa knocks DOWN THE THREE HE HAD FIVE of them in the last time out and he knocks down his first three This young freshman is coming into his own gaining confidence with every minute on the floor Coach Cable told him he said Just be aggressive Play your game Dont worry about your teammates In the lane the floater is short and theres a foul on the Panthers Yeah Well thats what Donaldson does right He puts a lot of pressure on the defense by driving that thing hard into the paint You think well youre getting 46 points a game in the paint It must be the big guys Uday Henderson and Renu in there working out But its Donaldson and Washington Those guys really love driving that thing hard to the rack First free throw is good You can take a look at what Dre Donaldson has done season after season The scoring average goes up and up This guy came over from Michigan Hes really turned into the leader of this squad already from Miami Again total new team No one on the team last year is a part of the Miami Hurricane squad this year Yeah you touched on it Coach Cable said he hes you know pretty much the head of the snake Renew is going to score the most points but they go way Donaldson goes Selea again for three That ones no good Washington and he turns it over Well the Canades have been off for about nine days now and a lot of times during the Christmas break no matter how much you get the team back in the gym after that break theres going to be a little rust on that machine Right now you can see one of the highest scoring teams in the ACC struggling here in the first couple minutes third in the ACC in scoring The Canes average 89 points per game Heres Dunning Cut off the baseline Heres Miner Hell pull from beyond the arc Its an air ball I Im not sure if that shot wasnt blocked Coach Cable is saying it was blocked Hes out here arguing with officials that it was touched here Coach Cable asking for the block Coach Cables asking for the block The official said Do you want a challenge And Coach Cable stood said stood down said No we would not challenge that I think it was blocked Heres Renu in the paint Bullies his way to the bucket Hell draw a foul Yeah he he just so big and so strong and so long He gets that right shoulder into the defender when with that left hand it just fools a lot of guys Doesnt matter how many times in film sessions in the morning shootound you tell your players that hes a lefty You got to get on that left hand regardless Hes going to fool a couple guys early on and get himself to the foul line That fouls on Copa The one problem for Pit is you cant get into foul trouble especially that big line You talk about their bigs because theyre only going to go Coach Gables only going to go about seven guys eight guys at the most Yeah And theyre not theyre not a good shooting team But look at these numbers here at 20 plus points per game scores Cameron Boozer with 23 And you can see right there Malik Rena Renault hes not far behind 204 Good free throw shooter at almost 80 from the line Knocked him in Yeah Renew third in the conference in scoring at 20 a game Transferred in from Indiana Onepoint lead here for Pit Miner Caleppa with five on the shot clock Spins reverse and lays it in Kids crafty right Like young freshman down there doesnt get rattled Takes his time and operates and comes out with a bucket Heres Washington Too strong Rebound Corin Here comes the Panthers again Panthers doing a good job controlling their own defensive glass cuz thats something Miami really wants to do is pound the offensive glass Try to get those second chance points Look at this one more time Good footwork down here Get him going one direction Spin underneath the basket And I tell you what this kid is growing up right before our eyes Look at that Its a pair of rugby shorts as well The number one uh high school player in rugby Yeah he was the number one ranked rugby player there in Australia So this is the first time he has ever just played one sport in basketball That jumper is short by Neyas Indraitis Yeah U on that glass He does a nice job getting those rebounds Nearly 10 rebounds a game Henderson driving Shot blocked but put back up and in by Omari Witherspoon Yeah thats a big fella down there U yeah excuse me Yeah U chewing glass early Gets the defensive board hustles Hes got good wheels Gets in position on the offensive glass for that put back some second chance points Andrew Zitis again tried the left hand No good Henderson comes away with the board Thats that big front line presenting that wall underneath Thats what they love to do They love to push the pace I was just saying Us got good wheels If hes now rebounded hes running like a freight train right into your living room for a slam dunk at the rim Onepoint lead here for Miami Donaldson loves throwing that high hand off Heres Gorhan working on Uday Sets the high screen from Miner Miner had it lost it gathers it kicks it out Caleppa corner three No good Henderson lost it Renew Hes fouled Well you see some of that rust starting to come up say I help assist those pe those players Absolutely Asia Wilson could go Yes she can Theres Renew Knocks down that first free throw Shoots it at 79 on the season Got them both A little fullcourt pressure by the Canes after that second made free throw Now they back off Brendan Cummings has checked in for pit number three That three is good by Barry Dunning Jr And listen Coach Cable will tell you over the last nine games hes been pitch best player Yeah Dunning Jr He got he can do a little bit of everything Hes strokering from the outside He plays good defense He can slash to the basket Heres Donaldson for three That shot no good Here comes Cummings with the board Here comes the Panthers now Tied at 10 Miner to Cummings Theyll pull out that three Cummings Good Wow Check into the game Second time you touch it you step out behind the arc We said Hey Pits got to shoot the ball well from the outside if they want to have a chance to stay in this basketball game And right now theyve knocked in three triples Shoot it at 36 as that one off the glass is good Onepoint lead for the Panthers Yeah Drew Washington Donaldson all their guards can get in that paint and score or get fouled and get to the free throw line Goran he draws that foul on Renew Well tomorrow afternoon you can catch a New Years Eve mens hoops a rivalry double header on the ACC network ESPN app starts with two Eastern Commonwealth Clash Blackburg Virginia Tech taking on Virginia And then you got Cam Boozer and Duke as they take on Georgia Tech In fact we got a couple of former Duke assistants now head coaches here Jeff Cable and Jay Lucas Yeah did some good job there Coach Cable with with co coach K learning under his toutelage No wonder hes got 17 years as a head coach there And theres that double block there Of course uh Jay Lucas as well doing a good job He had the team one of the top defensive masterminds last year at Duke Corin miss Dante Allen has checked in from Miami as well Yeah Corins got five Excuse me Brian Corins got to get going from them Theyre going to have to get some interior scoring They should they made 16 of 27 threes uh in a game early against Bigington but theyre not going to get that against Miami Renu just so good at finishing around the basket I dont know He was a Big 10 honorable mention the last two seasons and hes come over here to Miami in the ACC and is just a superstar They go into the post Cam Corin got it Thats what they need They need that 260 lbs beef working out in that paint down low causing havoc Heres Renu again He attacks off the glass Cannot let him drive left and get that right shoulder into you He finishes already at 53 of the time that shot Hes going to finish 65 to 68 when you let him go to that left hook Kieran Mullen sitting the high screen for Miner Rolling They throw it up to him Just a bit too high He was wide open down there sliding down that line right lane line but just couldnt connect Look at my guy right here Or they call him Leak So good So crafty Look at that Just little shimmy Put the ball on the floor one time Gets straight to the rack First turnover for the Pit Panthers Down one Heres Donaldelsson Uday sets it THROWS IT UP U THROWS IT DOWN They are the master of the pick and roll with the bigs Donaldson over 10 assists four times this season where hes had 10 plus points 10 plus 10 plus assists Hes number one in the country in that statistic Well coach Lucas was telling us and he even said it as shoot around to day If you set a good screen and roll you should have about five to six dunks tonight Allen no Kicked out Renu Yes Once you start visualizing that ball going through the basket a few time I dont care if its scoring inside or the free throw line that basket becomes big as a hula hoop next outside shot is more likely than not to find the range Miami now on a 70 run and it happens quick right Like its a dunk at the rim Then its a three Its an offensive board Its a slash to the basket Heres Cummings Dunning junior His three is no good Rebound Allen The kick Three No Renew Its too strong Another offensive board here from Miami Whoa McCaines are crashing the glass DONALDSON THROWS IT UP FOR U UD They got pushed in the back but the officials didnt call it Witherspoon reverses and they call it offensive Foul on Witherspoon just absolutely crushing him on the glass 134 advantage on rebounds 5 advantage on the offensive rebounds So Kanes really crashing the glass That shot blocked but the followup is good Yeah Henderson right on Q Another offensive rebound and put back We talked to Jayl and say What are some of your metrics And one of them he says I want my team to get as as many second chance points as they do offensive rebounds And boy they off to a nice start here in the first 10 minutes of this game Gorehan working on U spins goes to the right hand this time Shot a little short and here comes True Washington behind the back and offensive Oh true Washington cant believe me Just put an NBA move on him I look like John Mor coming down this left lane line Dont call me for that ticky tack foul Its the ACC Let us play you You be the judge right here Uday the clear out Oh they called U for clearing out inside I thought they had good call or good catch there Brian Yeah I thought they had got Washington uh coming down there but U he did clear out just a little too much with the arm If you keep those elbows bent youre generally okay Once you start spreading those arms out it makes it real easy for an official to make the call Caleppa extra pass corner to Miner But again just one shot and done and the Canes are out and running Here comes Henderson Henderson downhill lays it in The freshman out of Houston The ability to be able to go coast to coast is amazing by some of these bigs Whether maybe not Uday but Henderson uh and and Renu can really get that ball off the glass and take it to the other end 110 run for the Kes Lead is now double digits Miner Witherspoon with four inside Corin lays it in Nice find underneath When you need a bucket you got to go inside for one Those threes that they had early arent falling so you got to go inside and attack inside the basket They go to their leading scoreer And he delivered Hes just a dude right Like Corin hes just a big strong young man fully grown And theyre going to call that one it looks like on team Malovitz Oh Taybo says I dont I Im not strong enough to push anybody off Why you calling that one on me I Im a threepoint specialist All I do is shoot the threes I dont crash the glass Heres Corin with it Andrew Sides will go to the line Backto back times attacking the basket Wants for Corin This time another young fella puts his head down off of that high pick and roll They they call that play shake They want to get a lot of movement off the top Try to confuse the defense And then when you gain that advantage uh attack the basket Thats a staple there for Caleppa as well Looks like thats going to be the second one on Malovves And so Noyz Andrewis hes the Iowa State transfer We go to the line Shoots only 61 from free throw stripe here this season Those are Scott Williams numbers from the line right there laughter He got to He got to pick it up young fella Get some more time in that lap Thatll come Hope Coach Cable dont get mad at me for giving out his play call there But I heard Coach Lucas is giving out the same play call So I think I think the secrets out on some of those sets that hes running on the offensive end I got to say I liked my time with Coach Cable today I didnt know what to expect talking to a Duke guy uh this this afternoon I should say but he was he candid and open with this look at that has the followup by Corhan and another miss by Andrew Sides but Corhands right there and for coach Cable look eighth season there I tell you what if that administration gives him the resources like a lot of these schools in ACC has you you know you got a great coach who can turn a program around especially what hes already done at pit yeah and after that time out hes got his team on a nice little uh run here What is that now 500 run here 60 run excuse me to get his team right back in it So nice job calming his team down after they fell down by double digits Look at the record by season there by coach Cable now Yeah I mean you know the 23 ACC coach of the year 24 wins 22 wins The guy can certainly do it Yeah I mean they got 70 wins since the 22 season which is fifth in the conference behind Duke Car and Carolina So hes done a nice job and one How about Omari Witherspoon the freshman out of Maryland Look at fly a little heavier now on Henderson Got to get him going Pit knocks down their first free throw of the afternoon and it is the Panthers now on a 70 run and theyve cut the lead which was 10 to just three almost a little matchup zone they got going defensively That three is short Well North Florida I thought to coach Cable North Florida went to his own defense and really rattled the Canes for a bit before they were able to kind of find the holes and the penetration and then with the pass So Im not surprised Coach Cable said he he would go to some zone after made free throws or timeouts Back cut Witherspoon Its blocked Was that Trey Mo the three ball Rather with the block Donaldson gets in the paint Its no good And back the other way Here comes Miner Hell pull up from three Its no good Tipped out but to Barry Dunning Jr who lays it in and the lead is now just one Yeah not controlling their glass They really done a good job on their defensive glass Now the Canes during this run here have gotten two offensive rebound leading to four points Uday the high screen Henderson back Washingtons three is no good Corin the rebound and the Panthers can take the lead Panthers doing a better job on the glass on both ends All those second chance points offensive rebounds that Canes were getting when Renu was in the game Now theyre shutting all that down doing a better job like you said can tie or take the lead on this possession 6 minutes until the half MINER GETS DOWNHILL USES THE LEFT hand off CL So good so crafty His quicks just quicker than everybody else in a white jersey right now Taking that ball to the off the off hand finish Onepoint lead for the Panthers Donaldson off the glass a little short Andrew Sidus with the board Knocked away by Henderson Well the Gates got to figure out a way to start doing it with defense their offense isnt going and right now it is anybodys uh opportunity to drive that ball down that lane and thats something Jay Lucas will not be happy with because he prides on winning that battle of points in the paint right now Pit is taking it hard to the rack and Panthers have knocked down five of their last seven shots heres Miner with five on the shot block up and under GOT IT WHAT A SHOT by Demarco Miner And the Panthers are rolling Theyre up three A great job But give Coach Cable a lot of credit too when his team fell behind by double digits He settled he settled them down You dont win 283 games uh for your career by not being able to handle an early run by the by your opponents Backto back runs here And theres a turnover by Miami Yeah Henderson the freshman like I say theyre going to rely on him to score a little more with Renew on that bench and he just shuffled those feet coming down See that little extra step Yeah he just hes got that little extra step and the officials right on top of it A lot of times you see that when you know at the especially at the NBA level they dont call that anymore but officials taking it back to the 90s basketball back when I played calling players for just a little drag of the uh pivot foot Under five until the half A little reach in there by Donaldson Is that the eighth team foul now on Miami Sure enough is So Pit now in the bonus situation Theyre going to go to the line and shoot free throws the rest of the half See Renew down on that bench with those three fouls Solid look on uh coach Lucass face A little look of concern here as his team is falling down by three maybe four If Witherspoon can convert this one and one knocks down that first one Witherspoon again a freshman out of Buoie Maryland Yeah And this kid right here I mean he has got some live legs I on my uh scouting report here all I circled was hops This kid gets up off the floor in an explosive fashion Its almost like hes angry at the rim when he dunks it The run is now 150 Pit And its a fivepoint lead for the Panthers Heres the open three No good by Dante Allen Yeah no offensive rebounds Alunus was down underneath there but he couldnt get it Look at the speed at which the Panthers are playing now That shot was short by Mari Witherspoon Heres Dante Allen back the other way inside to Henderson The follow is no good And it is Witherspoon who comes away with it Miner will walk it up with four minutes to play until the half Miami has now missed seven straight shots Stuck in mud right now Theyve been on 25 for a good long time here Even the shots at the rim offensive tip uh tips Nothing falling Heres Corin Faces knocks down the baseline jumper I like that right there Right You got a bigger stronger guy on you You step him off the block You square your shoulders Little jab step find range and then you knock in a midrange jumper Lead is seven WASHINGTON HAS HIS POCKET PICKED MINOR UP AHEAD ANDREW SITUS The layup is no good But Dunning Jr is right there Corner three YES screaming Pit is rolling Pit is absolutely rolling They are crashing the glass now That is their fifth offensive rebound since they were at a 50 deficit on the offensive glass A 200 run by the Pit Panthers and a tie up by Barry DUNNING JR WHAT HAS HE NOT DONE here in this first half 35 25 pitch Yeah And theyre doing it by going inside right is a 10 to four advantage points in the paint on this run Henderson finally Well thats what they needed right They needed somebody to step up and drive that thing to the rack Come away with a basket A lot of times when a team gets off of a number theyve been on for a long time like 25 now pushes it to 27 Lets see if they can take that and try to build on that to take it to the locker room in the final two and a half minutes of this half Yeah Miami had gone seven minutes basically without scoring Heres Corin with it Uses his body and powers his way in Kisses it off the glass The lead is back to 10 Well Miami is switching that pick and roll when its leaving a mismatch underneath for Corin Hes just having his way Hes eating cake down there in that post Doing a nice job now double figured scoring with 10 points Its Trey Donaldson with the floater in the M in the paint and theyre going to call a foul on the Kane And youre right you know thats already one and one So chance to push it to the largest lead of the game Could go up by either 11 or 12 if he can make them both This what they want to do They want to crash the glass and you can see Donaldson just gets a little bit of a arm there That right arm comes out away from his body a little too far and they might have sold a little bit with the acting job of falling to the floor putting it on the officials to have to blow that pee They still use a pee in the whistle They got something else in there nowadays laughter Usually have a little pee in there right Yes Showing your age bro 57 and fat I tell you what these jackets will get a little hard to to button up over here like the holiday hangovers I put on my pants Barry Dunnan Jr head to the line again I mean this guy who is you know hes a guy went to UAB then South Alabama and you know I think at the beginning when he first came to pit it was more of you know can I do it at this music level the ACC level and I think hes already realized oh I can do it cuz hes certainly been their best player here over the last nine 10 games Yeah hes doing a fantastic job Hes aggressive Hes got the confidence as you said but hes also being aggressive leading all scorers now Well at least tied with uh Renew with 11 points looking for 12 knocks him down And you know what Coach Lucas he probably in his heart of hearts wanted to blame Renew back in during that 200 run but thought you know what its a long game We got the entire second half 20 minutes to play Do not want my big fell to pick up a fourth here in this first half But they needed him Andrew Sides INSIDE TO CORIN THE FOUL AND IT ROLLS OFF Big Corin has positioned himself down in that lower third of that painted area and just says Hey home or on the road This is my house down here and Im going to flex these 240 lbs and make you guys have to deal with a fully grown young man down here on this block Yeah What Cam has done to his body over this summer Its amazing He is rock solid now Misses that first free throw He only shoots it at 67 on the year but hes a guy whos already got four double doubles this season transferred in over from Florida State Gets one of two and the run Its 252 run here for Pit over the last seven minutes This is a hard thing for the Canes too Right now Pits got all that momentum going to the locker room here Largest lead of the game at 13 points Just the fifth team foul on Pit Oh no free throw Side out of bounds here for the Kings Always pay attention to how teams operate their side out of bounds or baseline out of bounds play Well coached teams will get good looks at a field goal and with plenty of time to work with on this shot clock 20 seconds to play Henderson spinning and hell go to the line Well weve seen Henderson twice now for freshman show a lot of moxy and knowhow of how to drive the ball hard one way spin back after the contact and then get the shot up The officials have to blow that whistle Shelton Henderson out of Houston Hes a 66 freshman 240 You see that body on this young man Hes Eric Dickersons nephew fivestar recruit coach Lucas got out of Houston In fact he is the second highest ranked recruit Miamis ever had I know the football coach is probably looking at this young man like Hey maybe maybe I want to talk to him after the end of the season Listen when he was in high school the football coach salivated over him Tried to get him to play football as well He said Sheldon said every time he would see him hed run the other way cuz he just didnt want to face him and tell him I dont want to play football I just want to play basketball Coach is stalking him around campus I cant blame him laughter You see that body on that young man Oh my god Well they got so Shelton Hendersons in They got some work to do They got to figure out a way to slow this pit attack Andrew Zidis misses Heres Dante Allen attacking and lays it in Just got Allen back He broke his hand early on and uh his dad Malik and I battled in the league So he came out here getting some of his first buckets of the season here Nice drive after the rebound pushed it in transition before the big defense had a chance to set itself Yeah Dad assistant at the Miami Heat Played in the league as well 30 seconds until the half 10 on the shot clock for DeMarco Miner MARCO POLO KNOCKS IT DOWN IN FACT THATS HIS NICKNAME POLO Step back three 10 now until the half Do hell pull too strong FOLLOW YES AT THE BUZZER OH THEY needed that in the worst way Drew Washington clash He had them rolling They were controlling the paint They were doing just about anything they want They got on the offensive glass But when he sat down youre right It was like the Kings just had a flat tire They got stuck in mud at that 25point plateau and let Pit run off that 20 to0 run to take the lead in the momentum to the locker room on a 288 run Now you can see the Canes coming back here They dont want to get another foul over No theyre playing a little zone defense Heres Miner Hell go oneonone Fades Shot rolls off Whos the man on the glass Renu gobbling up the the defensive board Kick out for three No good Renu had it Lost it Almost got tied up there with Corin Yeah Went in there for that offensive glass Almost had it first time but then he tried a second time like you said and there was some contact underneath there Good thing the officials did not blow that whistle because they they wouldnt even been able to put him on that bench Yeah Selea high screen miner three two hell have to force it up and that zone has been effective here Two possessions come up empty for Pit and back the other way and off the glass and in is Trey Donaldson Yeah Jo Coach Cable does not want to see that He does not want to see them getting defensive rebounds and running in transition before his team has a chance to set defensively Miner Zeppa CORIN ROCKS the rim Great passing between the bigs right there Getting that ball below the free throw line puts so much pressure on the defense You said the cutter right down the lane and boy did that young man know how to finish above the basket Cuts off Washington The three no good Caleppo with the rebound Miner pass stolen Shelton Henderson a little out of control but the foul Can you believe me when I said that was the first steal of the game for Miami Theyve got some turnovers They forced 11 in the first half but that was the first live ball turnover And I love this one here by Cale Leeppa with a big man coming right into your living room with a jam Drew Donaldson calls for the pick Swings it to Washington Washington in the paint Turn fires knocks it down He got kind of lucky there Washington kind of bobbled that ball Mishandled it Was able to stay with it Good concentration to get that shot up there with the left hand right there in front of the rim Jay Lucas likes what he sees Heres Miner Andrew Situs in and out Tip back out to him Miner has it Got to in the paint Swarmed Andrew Situs again misses the three Here comes Drew Washington Donaldson Yes Trey lays it in And here comes the Canes as they chip away Yeah nice job controlling the defensive glass on that uh third attempt I should say And then getting out and running like Drew Washington Donaldson those guys just put so much pressure on that defense the way they can push that basketball Trying to go high low again This time broken up and stolen by Miami Renu kicks it out TO WASHINGTON THE TRIPLE YES And just like that the Canes come storming back and the lead is now just three What an answer One for 11 in that first half So good to see that three ball going if youre a a Canes fan Well you know Pit only had two turnovers in the entire first half Theyve already had a couple of turnovers that have led to Kane buckets here in the second half Heres the minor Kim Corin sets the pick Rolls Dunning junior for three No good Rebound Washington Washington Stop Pops Too strong Uhoh Is that Renew Got a little media timeout here Threepoint lead for Pit Complete teams in the tournament Alabama and Indiana Were going to see how good the Hooers are taking on Alabama Lots of good football right now We got some good basketball ACC conference play beginning the night Corin hits it Barry Dunning Jr misses that three He has been hot in the first half Heres Donaldelsson Hands it to Renu Donaldson again the kick out Sheldon Henderson from the corner rolls out Loose ball tipped and its going to stay with Miami See look at that In around and out that did everything but go all the way down and Kanees will inbound it to Renu Working on Caleb kick out Henderson back to Renu Drives the baseline DOUBLE TEAM BUT STILL GETS IT IN Onepoint lead now for Pit We played five minutes here Its a 90 run for the Canes and theyll go back to the two3 zone Stolen Donaldson comes UP WITH THE STEAL HENDERSON OFF THE glass and Miami has retaken the lead Its their first lead since what 648 of the first half Wow Have they come out of this locker room on fire Its a zone defense It has rattled the Panthers INSIDE screaming IS BLOCKED ALUMIS INSIDE SLOT SHOTS AWAY Donaldson now in the paint and kicks it back out Theyll reset Washington has it and the region Theyll call on pit Well thats what Donaldson does right They know that getting a little short in the shot clock The initial attack didnt work that got the ball back into their playmaker and he went inside there and caused that contact and earned himself an opportunity to uh put some more time on that shot clock You see DeMarco Miner hes going to have a seat Brandon Cummings has come in for him Oh look at Donaldson He just bullied his way He bullied his way to the cup and lays it in Donaldson said did absolutely nothing offensively in that first half and he has been a man on fire here in the first seven minutes to start the second half This is zone defense They got to figure out a way to tack it inside 130 run here for the Canes Nearly comes up with a steal Dunning running missing and here comes Miami Washington to renew The three is no good Cam Corin comes down with it Here comes Pit Dunning Dumps it home Nice job getting that thing Long shot out of the corner by Renu which I dont think he should have taken Got to get yourself back going when youve been sitting for so long in the first half by going inside The easy run out then the high hand off We talked about the athletic ability of Dunny 14 points in a game to lead all scorers Onepoint lead Washington the triple in and out Rebound Witherspoon Witherspoon has it to Brandon Cummings and Brandon Cummings has set the offense Three Got it Wow Cummings does a nice job showing a ball fake on Donaldson He flies by and then he just knocks in the triple You know Cummings was starting and then Coach Capel said You know what I love when he gives us the scoring punch off the bench Coach Smith when he got that second national championship there in 93 Couldnt get it done for him when I was in school for four years from 87 to 90 But Im glad he got it right after I left I left school Boy I was jealous of some of my teammates that were still on that on that spot like George Lynch and uh you know that those were some quality basketball games back there in the early 90s Wow How about that ill shot by Omari Witherspoon from the top of the key Renu lays it in Redu said I cant play timid anymore Imma put my head down and drive to the rack No more of these threepoint shots trying to avoid a foul And he g he got the heat excuse me the cage back up by one Caleppa kicks it back out to Cummings Oh good extra pass Caleppa down low hangs scores and one This is just a big strong rugged freshman You got Uday great shot blocker been around the Texas TCU and now here doing his thing chewing glass in Miami He just takes this contact like hes been playing at this level his whole life Coming off a careerhigh 28 points when it was 10 to 16 And he made that look easy after the contact knocks down the free throw Completes the threepoint play Twopoint lead for Pit Almost halfway through the second half Renu spinning and draws the foul Well thats just a lot of knowhow down there right I tell you he turns that right shoulder in as a lefty into the defender better than anybody in the ACC I am not exaggerating He is just so good and crafty at creating this contact Its just so quick Bam Tight right into the defender Hes the one initiating the contact and the defenders the one catching the foul Third on Roman Cppa I never had a spin move Brian I could have been a play I could have been an offensive force in the NBA If I just had a spin move maybe Jordan would have passed me the ball more than once a month Yeah I dont know if he was going to pass it though Maybe twice a month I have got the ride Come on J Open baby I went to Carolina laughter Hook a Tarhill up Both free throws are good Speaking of Tar Hills boy theyre in a battle with Florida State tonight Up by now up by nine But Caleb Wilson he this kid hes must see TV Hes got 14 and 12 They still got half the second half to play Yeah theres some great freshman in the country Really are Especially here in the ACC You got Cam Boozer over at Duke Hes doing his darn thing Theyre going to be a tough out for anybody thats got to face them in the tournament CUMMINGS IN THE CORN NO THE ALEPPA YES OH Pit doing a nice job attacking that interior now of the Canes Twopoint lead for Pit 10minute mark here in the second half Donaldson The shot rolls off but there is Renu Renu just so long right between U and Renu and Henderson They can get on the offensive glass as well Tied at 54 Wonder how long coach Lucas is going to stay in his zone defense Corin knocks it down Yeah Now if theyre getting good looks like that hes going to have to come out of that zone defense Theyre not rebounding great out of it and a little 12footer from the front of the rim Well not that coach Lucas happens I dont know how much theyve actually worked on his own defense I think this is just something he drew up at halftime to get his team back in the game and try to avoid some foul trouble Good reach in and a steel Miner THEYVE GOT NUMBERS LAYS IT UP AND THROWING IT DOWN IS CAM CORIN OH and drawing the charge One official said block And you I think they got a block on CPA Theyre going to call block Yeah theyre going to call on CPA He looked like he was there Yeah And thats his gonna be his fourth fourth foul But boy I tell you what I like the way Pit is really rushing that ball to the the other end of the floor Oh we got Miners limping off the floor here for Pit Thats huge That might be one of those fields where just two bodies collided Maybe got a a knee to the thigh and give it a few moments and maybe itll calm down for that young man Look at that contact underneath I told you about how this young man Reneu likes to get into the body of the defenders and that was one of those 5050 calls It could have gone either way How about this Pit up by four under 10 to play We didnt really see that this morning at the shoot around Even coach Cables probably overly ecstatic to what position hes in right now Chance to try to steal one on the road Place where the Canes are perfect Nine and0 See theyre rubbing that right It looks like calf of Minor So it looks like maybe hes cramping up Theyre rubbing that right calf Demarco Miner Renew Meanwhile knocks down both free throws Twopoint lead Renew so good at the line A big guy to get draw fouls and get the line and shoot close to 80 from the free throw line Its just just a huge plus to have Miner you see on the sideline trying to hydrate Renew already 10 points here in this second half Hes got 21 in the game Game high score Heres Ba Cummings with five Draws the foul and hell go to the line Oh he is shifty with those handles The young freshman had done just such a nice job switching out to a smaller player and was doing a really good job cutting off not allowing the drive but just trying to get out to challenge that threepoint shot Hes trying to do too much at that point And thats when youre going to realize I got a couple fouls on me now All I got to do is stay on the ground slowly approach get a hand in the shooters face and if he makes it pat him on his backside and say Hey good shot He had done all his work early Look at the officials talking to him just a little bit Said Hey if you go up you get verticality but when your body is moving towards the shooter and he gets leans in and gets a little contact theyre going to blow you for a whistle all every time in the ACC Lets see They wanted to see if he was behind the line or not That foot when he went up Yes Yeah Those those right Nike black Nikes they are You could tell there was a little space between his Nikes in that black threepoint line for sure Yeah hes got hes got them bedazzled huh Yeah he got he laughter got he got him ready for New Years Eve down I tell you what we were asking Brandon like why did everyone call you Biba He said well when I was a baby my nickname was B boy and grandma kept calling me Ba She says it was easier to say than B boy so it stuck Your grandmas will give you some nicknames when youre young Thats for sure About peanuts all the time or the shape of peoples heads and grandma will say like Yeah for sure He wasnt able to get that free throw to go And uh and thats odd considering this guys 82 free throw shooter Hes already missed two of them Hes got one more cheering Kanes crowd coming alive here AND HE MISSED ALL THREE Oh my goodness Pit is seven of 15 from the free throw line tonight Lead remains two Donaldson no rebound The freshman Kieran Mullen pulls it down Well Washington and Donaldson hit a couple threes early in this half but uh theyre better off when they were trying to attack or draw and kicking for somebody uh uh one of their teammates and just a stand still three dribble down no passes not working the defense side to side Its not exactly what coach Lucas wants Biba gets the roll I tell you what Cummings all this kid has done is averaged 19 points Shot 58 from the field 53 from three over the last three games All of that off the bench is what hes been averaging Thats why they love the spark he gives them And Drew Washington cuts through the paint but man that half court zone defense on them And if youre the Hurricanes I think now is the time that maybe you try to mix it up on a little bit Cook Cables been drawing up offensive plays against that zone defense Maybe surprise them coming out of these timeouts with a little manto man See if you cant force some live ball turnovers to get you some transition baskets Washingtons got one more Gets that one to drop Lead is two Miami is perfect from the free throw line Corins got it Heres Cummings Nearly stolen And it is stolen Renew No the follows no good but a foul Nice job by Henderson following up Renew right to the basket Hes going to earn himself a trip to the to the free throw line But they didnt do it with a mantoman defense that gave him the steal It was the zone defense Active hands the poke away everybody rotate I love that right there Like just selling out offensively playing solid defense Theyre up against the shot clock and then they hit the fourth one inside and you get that deflection and theyre off to the races the other way And Henderson 60 free throw shooter cannot make the first Thats the first miss of the night from Miami from the free throw strike Freshmans got 10 points tonight Missed them both Tipped Taken away by Cummings who lost it got it back and the possession arrows pointing towards Miami Well when I was in Carolina 100 years ago they used to keep track of a first to the floor where that ball is loose I love the way these young men at the college level will jump down on that floor and give up a knee burn or bruised elbow to try to get the ball back for their teammates Miami needed that ball They got that ball back and now they have opportunities to score here to tie this game Seven minutes left in the game Kes have won six straight pit two straight corner No looks to renew Miss but a foul Well I talked about it earlier Teams that uh are well coached operating extremely well on the baseline out of bounds plays and the sideline out of bounds plays And you can see right there two players flying out at Donaldson left a mismatch underneath there And they got the ball into the hottest player on the floor in Renew and he delivered by going to this free throw line Hes perfect from the line by the I hope I didnt just dink him He has been excellent here in the second half Hes got 22 points on the night Yeah And this kid was saddled for three fouls in that first half He didnt play the almost the final eight minutes of that first half You would have thought that would have thrown him off and hed been taking some time to get back into this game But its almost like he didnt miss a beat from when he went out when he was leading all everybody and scoring with the 11 points he had in the first half Now hes a perfect 10 a 10 from the free throw line Demarco Miner has checked back in for Pit He had that cramp in the calf and been out for a couple of minutes He comes in Cummings comes out Were all tied up at 60 Start of ACC play Yeah Kane still staying in that zone D Dunning cut off on the baseline Hell stay with Pit 5 seconds on the shot clock Uday is arguing that hey Id bounce that ball off of one of the Panthers but uh officials arent buying what hes selling but theyre going to have to work quickly here They find the first option out of this sideline out of bounds and get it up on the rim Andrew Situs with two Forces it up Canes are tightening up the defense now Making it real tough on the Panthers to score Donaldson and hell go to the line What a crappy little move on that baseline by Donaldson Theres that spin move again down along that baseline Put a smile on that young mans face You got the defender thinking hes going to back the ball out and then spins back baseline gains that advantage and gets himself to the free throw line Chance to get to double figures and scoring here with 10 points with two made free throws and it rolls off Caleppa will check back in Andrew Sidius will come out Yeah see got to be careful here Six got four fouls Yeah 6 minutes 21 seconds to play and the young freshman has got those four fouls How aggressive can he be in these next four four and 12 minutes Missed them both but tipped all the way out Donaldson had it lost it Under six minutes to play Rolling is Renew and lays it in What a pass by Donaldson High pick and roll is the bread and butter Hes got great hands as he rolls down that lane and catches on the left side of the basket his favorite side of the basket And he finishes 25 points for that young nanny Season high for Cam for Renu Heres Cam Corin working on Renew The jump hooks no good And its Renew who comes down with the board Renus doing it all 25 points as you mentioned Give him six rodman rebounds off of the glass as well Donaldson and a bump Donaldson acts like he gets hit with a cannon when he gets that contact Hes going to sell it to the official Look at this pass by Donaldelsson Swings it over from one side of the defender to the next to find the right uh passing angle to get it to Renu And then like that down on the block there couldnt get that offensive rebound and Renu gobbles it up on a defensive glass I love those guys that will work both ends of the floor So Don Donaldson will go back to the line here Missed his last two New again with a season high 25 That that free throw stroke looked confident and good right there I think he got a little bit short by not getting up on his toes to finish the free throw Very important finishing that shot on your toes and following through Hes now in double figures In fact the last four games for Donaldson all hes done is put up 44 assists no five turnovers and hes put double figures up Yeah he hasnt got the assist numbers tonight like he normally does but hes doing all those other things to keep his team hanging around here trying to come from behind and get this victory 80 run here for the Canes up four Miner good from three Well Miners been in fact this that that was the first three for Pit here in the second half thanks to Demarco Miner Yeah Miner He left this game Remember he was limping off the court with that bad cam Maybe hes just playing possum on him That three no good Tipped out by Renew Oh coach Cable cant believe it Two big rebounds that they should have had One went all the way in the back court Kings came back and scored This one here by Renu using those long arms Heres Donaldson with five Big time three Well Donaldson just looks at Miner and says Whatever you can do I can do too And he knocked in a big three Boy this crowd has come to life Were under four to play Fourpoint lead for the Canes Unbeaten here at home so far this season 9 and0 Heres Corin in the lane Left it short They got a good look right in front of the basket Corin whos done most everything for this Panther squad just couldnt find a range on that little baby push shot Heres Donaldson working on Miner fade and gets the roll Donaldson saw a little opening in the middle and took a big oh step to get to a space on the floor where he could get a clean look at the front of the rim Sixpoint lead This zone defense that coach Lucas put in here in the second half has been devastating for the Panthers They cant figure out how to attack inside Under three to play Dunning the triple No good Ciao Miner Hell drive and go to the line And hes going to hold that right knee as we step aside one final time Miami up six 243 Sixpoint lead 243 to play Yeah Miner 90enter from the line Hes got to get these two down cheering Omari Witherspoon to check back in for Pitt Yeah a little offensive defense here by coach Capable He he realized how big this stop this upcoming possession for Miami is going to be Wants to get a little more size a little bit more athleticism on the floor Miner knocks them both down No doubt 90enters dont miss though You 27 to 30 going to the line You got extreme confidence This young mans a gamer Knocks down a triple and then he hits two two big free throws Fourpoint lead 230 to play Donaldson Got Miner on HIS HIP SPINS GOT IT HE IS TAKING OVER WOO That move was filthy dirty and nasty Tight little spin move in the in the lane there to get that clear space And hes knocked down two like that here in the final two minutes Papa Luke likes it Miner to Witherspoon drives the runner rolls off See Lipa kicks it out Marco no misses All those threes in the first half that were following they cant get consistent Three ball to go here in the second half Seems like Miami is taking the momentum here this final two minutes and trying to hold on to get this victory Im going to just put this ball in the hands of Donaldson Let this young man operate here Look a high pick and roll Renew No playing out of pitch Donaldson scored the last nine Nearly steal two seconds Renew off the glass No follow No good U had it Loose ball I think Ud got it back but he got tied up Thats going to be Panthers basketball Yeah possession arrows pointing toward Pit 117 to play You cant tell me these young men dont want it right here Look at the fight underneath this basket for this basketball U had it once he lost it Kings comes back to him again as Henderson was trying to drag it out from a couple Panthers I love college basketball baby There is nothing better than the raw emotion and energy and what these young men fight with especially conference plays tonight Here we go Sixpoint lead Cummings Pull three Short rebound Donaldson I was going to say get the ball in the hands of Miner Hes been a hot guy down the stretch here Not that Cummings hasnt had a nice game but hes not in double figures in scoring Pit one for 11 from distance here in the second half Hey bear in mind its only a twopossession game What a stop here They should be okay Henderson Renew Bucket big fella put the canes on his back here in the second half and knocks it watching be a little happier in that in the second half than he was in the first Youre right Heres Cummings Dunning Jr that three no good Corin inside They get the easy basket Lead is seven Well they came back They ran a play for a corner triple but that was off the mark as most of them have Lucas certainly has flipped this squad but this is a team that went seven and 24 last year Hes already got him at 11 and two Yeah Had a quick of a quick foul Thats one of those situations where you if you dont get the inbound steal now and youre down three possessions you got to foul quickly Got to try to extend this game as long as possible Now with under 24 seconds to play in this basketball game regardless of what happens at the free throw line here you got to rush it to the other end and try to start cracking up some threes Donaldson tell you what with he and Renew have done in this second half man Yeah I mean you know Indiana transfer Michigan transfer Those guys are used to playing big time basketball games in conference play and they ratcheted up their game here in the second half in this conference play Not going to let their team start 0 and one and to start the ACC One of two Miner will go straight to the cup and lay it in 16 seconds left Get you out to Cal and Stanford as soon as were done Or Louisville I should say Donaldson fouled with 10 seconds Well I got to give it to Coach Cable squad They came out here and competed their butts off but theyre going to come up a little bit short But you can see the Panthers even at seven and six about to go to seven and seven on the season They fight hard and if youre coach Kold thats something to work with right there Yeah You had two good games where you smashed a couple teams by a combined average of another 35 points But this is ACC play now and youre going to need guys that are in it for the fight thatll fight a few a full 40 minutes and he knows he has that in his squad now Hes got some good places to look uh as as kid the big fella inside Corin he hes a monster and hes just gonna get better as the season goes on That three no good And Miami remains unbeaten at home as they get a 7669 victory over the Pit Panther
