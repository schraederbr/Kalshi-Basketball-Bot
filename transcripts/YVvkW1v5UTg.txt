the turnover ratio meanwhile for Syracuse turnovers have been a real problem the last four games 21 21 18 and 15 turnovers during that time the orange has not won and so now JJ Starling starts at the point as jquan Carlos who had started at the point every game this year will come off the bench tonight Adrien ay continuing to shuffle the deck trying to find some answers the big man in the middle leaves it short Eddie lamin Jr on the reverse layup and the yellow jackets in their Road gray uniforms have the basketball first Georgia Tech Lance Terry is dynamic averaging over 15 points per game Nathan George a double double threat at the point this is Ryan Matumbo the son of the late dmbe Matumbo who played three times here in this building for Georgetown back in the day heres Jer Davis also back into the starting lineup for the orange as is the Freshman guard Elijah Moore having barely played the last two games off the bench and thats what JJ Starling brings to the Syracuse lineup off the bounce all the way to the basket and he makes it so much easier for everybody else to operate that was going to be a key though coming into this game speaking with the Syracuse coaching staff they want to attack the paint against Georgia Tech now that possession defensively for Adrien ay was a win they want for Nathan George to take 10 shots shot and not have him allow to get 10 assists George is a pass first point guard quick start for the orange Lucas Taylor with his first three now 11 for his last 20 and he came into this game 34 from the threepoint line thats a breakdown though cuz you said it hes been shooting better they duck behind the ball screen he made them pay Georgia Techs going to have to adjust their ball screen coverage as you know after practice yesterday Malcolm Taylor stayed around for at least a half an hour individual oneonone shooting with head coach Adrien Music ay St by violation by andanga didnt recognize and its a Georgia Tech turnover you cant ask for a better start if your head coach red ay the energy I think thats the key thing dug in this the energy theyve come out on the defensive end that has set the tone early on thus far yeah defensively Syracuse has really struggled in all facets so far this season more misfires on the three the oranges near the bottom of the ACC defending the threepoint line they are near the bottom nationally and defending inside the threepoint line but theyre still pitching a shut out here tonight two and a half minutes in and with that Javen McCollum gets off the Georgia Tech Ben he is instant offense and will come in at the next stoppage Taylor dumps it off lamp had it blocked look like Lance Terry got a piece of it now he gets the ball back and fires the three more will bring it back for the orange Davis goes to the left hand no Matumbo came over to perhaps get a piece it goes out of bounds back to the yellow jackets and so now with the bench for the yellow jackets getting involved this is a big part of the whole process for Damon Styers team JV and McCollum averaging over 12 per game and bench points for Syracuse has been a big deal this year as well yeah and I think on the Syracuse side obviously uh with the entry uh to their star freshman uh being out thats going to be key tonight what type of bench production they get its going to be huge in this game against a very solid Georgia Tech Team Ibrahim Suare the 69ine red shirt freshman also into the game for Tech George left alone and again for Syracuse defensively thats a win they want him shooting not setting up his teammates they didnt finish off The Possession misses his first shot attempt right now Syracuse sliding under ball screens Georgia Tech runs a lot of ball screens in their offense lampin nearly turned it over he has led Syracuse in turn turnovers this year about 2 and A2 per game for a guy who plays just over 20 minutes per game hes got to take care of the basketball more which is a constant point of emphasis during practice and thats been the issue for them in particular ACC games three games for Syracuse theyve have more turnovers than they do assists 34 assists 46 turnovers coming into this game Taylor around and out lamin got a hand on it tracks down the offensive rebound Applause Music Starling driving dish to the corner Davis air ball you cant ask for a better look dribble Drive draw the defense you get a wide open look from the corner there goes Terry strong to the basket and the yellow jackets have their first two points well he has just been playing lights out against so explosive you have to honor his three the help is not there and he is one of the better finishers in the ACC mentioned a shooting Malcolm two years ago Lance Terry came into the Dome and made Seven threepointers he was so good in scoring 24 that he forced then head coach Jim beheim out of his vaunted Zone into a manto man Starling little floater in the paint 72 Syracuse he is so good under control again theyre a different team with him in the lineup the numbers do not lie I also think the other guys benefit and get easier shots when hes in the defense on the perimeter for Syracuse with Moore and Starling Terry has it poked Away by Applause Starling more back to Starling who is standing on the side line and the orange turn it back over to the yellow jackets when we come back of this game thus far uh theyre just a completely different team with him in the lineup versus him out of the lineup and you can see hes got that WRA still on that left hand suffered the uh the broken bone in his left hand the day before the Tennessee game he fell uh trying to work around a screen just like that in practice here good recovery there to block the shot by mallum and he saves it to the orange great recovery that time by Music Starling on rebound comes to the yellow jackets numbers great job to find the trailer in Jaden mustaf one of the better looking freshman in the ACC he does not look or play like one big time finish and thats an area of concern for Syracuse transition defense uh coaching sta felt they have to keep Georgia Tech out of transition theyre very good yeah that was not off a turnover that was off a long rebound and the yellow jackets took advantage Jer Davis who was scoreless in three of his last four games previously he had been averaging 17 points a game for three so hes got to try and even things out guys first you tonight mustto under control in the paint for two more yeah very under control playing off of two feet that time the help is not there on the screen and very under control great elevation on his pullup jumper a big recruit for Damon St and his staff this year going to be an offensive foul say that Lucas Taylor when he went down extended that arm and there is the second year head coach former Arizona Wildcat star who uh was remembering yesterday he played in this building his senior year for the wild cats and uh well show you the video its good stuff remember he was a first team AllAmerican consensus first team AllAmerican his senior year average well over 20 points a game seven assists per game really good NBA career and trying to build things up in Atlanta with a yellow jacket I know it all too well played against that Arizona team out in Maui him khed Reeves was on that team as well too very good guard difficult match up Dongo posting up on the Freshman for Syracuse brings toughness Off the Bench Peter movich also Off the Bench Chris Bell for the first time for the orange illegal screen going to go against Jer Davis also Kyle cuff Jr and I think its on the hip lets see if he stuck the hip out yeah hip and arm again if he just stayed stationary then thats a pretty good screen but he gave a little extra on that one easy call for the rep to make so a turnover for the orange yellow jackets down three with the basketball George off the hesitation good headside defense by that man again movich his second defensive stop ni stov given a nice boost for red ay defensively Starling lost it Orange getting loose with the ball again here is mustto 65 210 lb from L Maryland missed the pushback couple of Point Blank chances squand by Georgia Tech now cuff gets his pocket pick moff right to the r this time he converts and a chance for three that is a big time Finish By The Freshman Jaden bu showing off the strength and one Carolina and they went to high school together promising young man obviously very bright future basketballwise but really as a young man too very impressive and future very bright for him number 66 in last years ESPN 100 gets his own Miss and he played his sophomore year high school where his dad did at the great damaa Catholic before transferring and finishing his high school days last year at overtime Elite down in Georgia but ACC basketball fans remember his dad very well during his days playing for Gary Williams at Maryland then was a firstr draft pick and played four years in the NBA and his son now flying with his father on his mind as his father passed away this fall Chris Bell Off the Bench with his first two points for Syracuse well uh this is another good sign uh for Syracuse Bell one of the better Shooters in college basketball starting to warm up again his last game four or four from the threepoint line against Florida State 18 points off the bench and now playing off the dribble as well too tough Runner that time Adrian ay told us yesterday that he felt with Chris Bell struggling so much bad pass thrown out of bounds by George back to Syracuse that Chris Bell had gotten so Twisted in his mind that he needed to make a switch take him out of the starting lineup so that he stops thinking about when hes coming out of the game and starts thinking about when am I going into the game and certainly that change in mindset the last two games has been good for him and from what coach ay says as he makes his first threepointer here in Syracuse since the middle of November the switch has been good for him yeah thats what he does again Ill say it one of the better Shooters in college basketball when he gets it going if youre not there on the catch he will make you pay his last made three in the dome is against Youngstown State before that last one and now hes made his last five including the four against Florida State on Saturday jakon Carlos got into the paint never looked at the rim and brings it back out tough off the back iron and its McCollum who comes away with the basketball and nice job that time by mustaf again he couldnt get the rebound but tipped it to his teammate to secure the board well you want to encourage George not to pass but to shoot it but if you leave him wide open hes going to make that shot yeah and percentage wise again this year he has not shot the ball that well but thats wide open and their secondary break the terrific sophomore with his first three points D soes into the offensive rebound but saves it to George AEK and Suare McCollum for fre off the front iron bodies go flying basketball goes out of bounds back to Syracuse well heres Saturdays ACC Network mens basketball triple header Clemson host Florida State at little John to start us off at 2 Eastern and then North Carolina and NC State Square Off in Raleigh and finally Virginia Tech takes on Cal should be a terrific afternoon and evening of Hoops on acc Network whenever uh State and Carolina get together especially in that building in Raleigh it will be electric still one of the better rivalries and sports college sports and youre right its always entertaining when those two get together Chris Bell putting it on the deck has himself two more points George lank clears the rebound Here Comes Carlos Syracuse on top by five so this has been a physical game the refs have let them play uh this has been a really physical game uh to start off in this first half thus far and so now you have come back from injury during your playing days what is JJ Starling going through mentally physically I asked him after shoot around yesterday or practice yesterday where you inhibited it in any way defensively Closeouts reaching uh with a different hand he said absolutely not there theres no change but its the rust Factor the fact that he went more than a month not playing a game that was the bigger yeah I think its its more about that to rust your timing and then also your wind again you can practice as much as you want theres nothing like playing in a live Applause game on rebound saved by mustaf yellow jackets with it Duncan Powell lost the handle Carlos always with his head up finds the trailing Starling who steps into a three ball and now the yellow jackets down five walk it up with Nathan George 63 sophomore from Toronto not that far from here in Syracuse about a three and 1 half hour drive up in around Lake Ontario under 10 to shoot fou gives it back to George offensive foul and George is pleading his case but I think this is a pretty easy call right here yeah got his arm out and refs right on top of that pretty good defense Again by Syracuse in their half court Davis Carlos Starling lampin and bell bell with seven quick points off the bench for the orange last couple of games hes now seven of eight Syracuse turns it over Starling misses lampin and so itll be Georgia Tech basketball when we come back to Syracuse out they tested it at Old blet Vocational High School on Syracuses West Side it worked out the NBA adopted it and in many ways it saved the NBA from itself because it used to be such a slow pace I did not know that Im not going to give you credit for it Im going to give our producer oh stop Kristen Hennessy credit for that because I dont want to say I got educated by Doug Sherman so but I did not know that and Im sure a plot of folks watching this game did not know that the shot clock was invented right here Terry had his dunk attempt blocked by Lin Carlos tough shot off the glass lanin got a piece of it but the yellow jackets Come Away With It great hesitation and then the window what I like about his game hes under control weve seen that now multiple times a lot of times young players they get a little out of control hes playing off of two feet when he gets into the lane hes got great size and body control Bell coughs it up two onone for the yellow jacket that was a pass that went off the rim Starling hangs in the air and gets the roll not sure how he got that one to fall Matumbo right there with him he hung in the air Twisted great body control and concentration good answer at the other end by Nathan George Damon STM told us yesterday that Georges superpower is getting the ball to the second side again he is a terrific passer always unselfish but dont sleep on his ability to score the basketball and thats the area credit STM and his staff Carl Hobs Bon Wells those guys do a great job and the Player Development Area his game has improved and thats the area it shows right here again you know hes a good assist guy but his midrange and his ability to score that really has been impressive Music Mor and Taylor will come back in Carlos and Bell take a seat Powell leaves mustaf also goes to the Georgia Tech Music bench McCollum and Dongo are back from the tech bench as is number 30 Ibrahim Suare red shirt freshman from Guinea George Tech is playing without three of its players due to injury and personal matters kaasi Reeves made the trip he averages about nine per game but still sidelined with a stress reaction in his right foot and LC OBriens the other big missing piece right now his right big toe has been injured since the middle of December still hoping to get both those guys back before too long and roll Lin unable to finish well good patience that time by Syracuse dunk attempt is missed by SW back and forth we go Taylor wide open the back iron lamp can keeps it alive with the yellow jackets come up with it George lobs to the rim and it is thrown down on the receiving end of the alley by nango on last years ACC all rookie team one of the better teams in transition as of late beautiful pass by George Gango for the slam and Doug in this game both teams really struggling from the threepoint line Syracuse now two of 11 below 20 from the threepoint line Georgia Tech hasnt taken many but they also have struggled one of seven now from the threepoint line Malcolm Syracuse as you know that has been a problem all year theyre 17th in an 18 Team league at under 30 for the season DAV is from the midrange now terrific box out inside by Suare to allow the yellow jackets to come up with it well theyre getting good looks though Doug both teams but in particular Syracuse theyre getting really good looks just unable to Applause Music Applause convert see the look on the face of the former NBA Rookie of the Year and theyre taking a look right now see if theres any blood I believe thats s just seeing if theres any blood on his Music eye scer is one of former 19 former NBA players currently head coaches at the division one level including a couple others in the AC Taylor got it Lucas Taylor last couple of games coming into this one Taylor has the offense on the up Tick 16 points and 10 points hes got six so far tonight and the lead is back to four mum with the runner hes got the lid off the basket first two points for the senior from Fort Meers Florida and thats the problem area defensively Lin again theyre going to put him in a lot of ball screens but colum that time came off clean nice little floater showing off the Touch Sy doesnt have much Rim protection this year T shot by Taylor and it goes through eight points in his starting roll tonight for Lucas Taylor well he came into this game only averaging Five Points a game so hes well above his average really aggressive this despite the good defense able to bank it home is Nate George well thats something we talked about it uh coach arrey said they wanted to make uh George a scorer as opposed to a facilitator and hes shown hes pretty comfortable trying to score the basketball as well too daving his will theyre going to count the basket Suare with the goal tending and so the orange are back up by four Applause during this break here in Syracuse the officials Clarence Armstrong Brent Hampton and KB berett have been reviewing whether indeed that goal tending call Will Stand Malcolm hucke what do you think well were going to get explanation right now so hold that Applause thought lets see if Clarence is going to share with us with a new technology in the ACC this year meanwhile Huck is getting the explanation on this side of the Court and you can see Clarence just waved and what was the word you got Malcolm so they went back and reviewed it and said there is no goal tending and that is the call so theyre reversing that uh there was no goal tending and now theyre reviewing possession and thats what they had to go back to so again I thought the initial was it was going to be goal tending because I felt the backboard was hit after we review the basket is does not count well go possession arrow Georgia Tech basketball so they had to go possession arrow after reversing the call so right here again yeah so again that angle it makes sense he hit the ball first now the initial angle I thought he just smacked the backboard and did not get the ball and I think thats the proper call again I couldnt see it from the angle I had here court side they went back reviewed it felt he got the ball first George no Davis good position inside and the over the back foul called against by Dango and thats something coach STM and his staff keep close track of again this year Dango continually gets into foul trouble hes had two foul outs this year five other games with four fouls so thats seven out of 15 games this year dangos been in foul trouble and that right there is perfect example hes got to let that go again hes too important to them youre blocked out youre not going to get that offensive rebound you like the aggression but hes too important to pick up fouls like that that was his first personal tonight Davis lost the basketball and here comes George attack four on two McCollum never could Corral it and lost it out of bounds a big missp possession opportunity for the jackets well heres Sundays ACC Network womens basketball quadruple header featuring three top 20 teams number 14 Duke takes on Virginia at noon Eastern then 19th rank North Carolina post Boston College followed by number 13 George attack and Louisville and we cap the day with Miami and Syracuse right here inside the Applause Dome five to shoot Starling for three Lins been very active on the offensive glass he just couldnt pull it in and so the yellow jackets get the ball back and Doug Ive been impressed both sides again you dont hear it talked about a lot on broadcast but blocking out both teams doing an excellent job blocking out keeping guys off the offensive class Syracuse is led the entire way led by as many as six mustaf misses the point blank shot that would have tied it more gets it back from Lin now gives it to the Colorado transfer Starling off the dribble handoff Rises up and is fouled confusion on the dribble handoff and Starling again hes got such great body control and strength watch this right here again are you hedging are you dropping go through contact and one thats a difficult floater he made it look easy we talked about it Doug the numbers with him in the lineup versus him out of the lineup its more than just scoring yes he can score yes he can set guys up I think another area where Syracuse has struggled defensively hes one of the better on ball Defenders uh in the ACC so again he does so much for them foul on Suare has Starling at the line Starling has eight points Lucas has eight Bell has seven mustaf has eight George has seven to lead the yellow Music jackets Miss fires Syracuse up four in the final minute of the first half Starling with a full head of steam missed the runner Dongo quickly up ahead to George Terry off the bounce rattles it home for three and thats what he does you think youre there thats a tough shot and Taylors right there with him he just little step back and again hes a guy coming off a 20point game seven boards and you already talked about it when he gets heated up from Beyond The Arc had seven in this building two years ago Bell thought he was fouled and now with a shot clock off Tech which has trailed the entire first half can take the lead with a Applause bucket timeout coach St well take it with him and be back to the dome in 30 seconds J Music Music with former Boston College Eagle Malcolm Huck Im Doug Sherman back here in Syracuse and so if youre Georgia Tech trying to take your first lead of the night on this final possession where do you look Malcolm well you know George is going to have the ball in his hand to leader and assist in the ACC uh Nathan George theyre going to put him in some type of ball screen and then play from there obviously they have to go quick 79 seconds if youre Syracuse right now I think with this lineup they have out there I think you can either switch or hedge you just dont want him to come off clean get into the paint and collapse and kick out for a three and so George Will inbound on the sideline to mustaf looking to go oneonone goes right around Bell who gives up the foul before the shot just the fourth foul against Syracuse here in the half so a smart foul Bell nearly let him get by without picking up that foul yeah good thing he grabbed him right there cuz youre right that was a clear path and uh red off wanted him to foul earlier so very fortunate there they had one to give now 49 seconds to go well they still got a couple a give they dont get the foul there threepoint shot is missed and the shot at the buzzer just off the mark by Duncan Powell and after a competitive first but Syracuse three of 13 23 from the threepoint line Georgia Tech two of 10 uh its going to be as simple as uh make some shots and dont turn the ball over for Syracuse the orange going with the same starting five to begin the second half that they did in the first same for Georgia Tech this is Elijah Moore The Freshman he had a quiet first half off to JJ Starling Lucas Taylor down the lane with the left hand a strong move to give him 10 points to lead all scores thats tough again with the left hand touch and through contact Terry Georgia Tech is not LED yet tonight the orange led by as many as six at 14 to8 but have never gotten any distance between themselves and the yellow jackets Eddie lansin spins to the Baseline tries to go over the left shoulder Matumbo able to cause enough problem defensively and back comes George attack great job that time by Matumbo again holding his ground not giving up any ground to lamp can forced them into a tough shot yeah Ryan Matumbo is not the shot blocker his dad dmbe was pretty much nobody was the shot blocker his dad was but he is every bit of 72 Applause 255 and then Bango the sophomore from Sagal who is their number one post player now has four points and he draws the yellow jackets back to within one and thats what he does last year on the all AC freshman team and and Dango again one of the better rebounders in the ACC after missing his first five attempts from the floor Eddie lampin now has a field goal well theyve made an effort to go to lampin thats twice now they fed him into the post to start this second half off and again Syracuse playing without its star freshman Donnie Freeman tonight he has a lower right leg injury and has his foot in a walking boot he mispriced yesterday and it was determined that he wouldnt be able to play here today no word on the length of time they expect for him to be out but without Freeman and his 13 points and eight rebounds a game other guys have to step up yeah the highest rated recruit that Syracuse has had since Carmelo Anthony was playing uh really well solid for them so certainly thats a big blow for Syracuse and red off Z Davis no lanin dribbled it off his own foot after getting the offensive board he stays with mooff all the way up the floor finds Terry for Applause three now Doug although they did not convert that thats a breakdown by Syracuse letting uh Terry be that wide open in transition from the threepoint line heres Terry again with three to shoot got it Lance Terry the Garder web transfer ties the game at 29 again you have to be there with him again that one contested off the step back but well you talked about it hes a guy that has the capability to put up numbers quick in particular from Beyond The Ark hes third in the ACC in threepoint shooting coming into this game at 42 another Syracuse turnover will give Georgia Tech a chance to take the lead Saturday night at 8 Eastern after our mens basketball triple header right here on acc Network in the ESPN app the nothing but net crew will break down the day in the ACC with highlights and Analysis of every mens game and look ahead at the best matchups on the schedule in the coming Music week Georgia Tech has won three in a row their offense has been high flying in recent days not so much tonight but a foul against Taylor will send Terry to the line to shoot two and potentially give Geor te first lead well they run a lot of actions for Terry they come him off get him off wheel Cuts curls and then that time they did all those actions just to get him isolated on the wing and again one of those guys thats on constant motion when hes on the offensive end very difficult to match up with because of his mve without the ball well back in early December at Oklahoma Terry joined the 1000 Point Club he spent three years in the Big South Conference at Gardner Webb this is third season in the ACC at Georgia Tech he was a medical red shirt last year so playing a sixth year and his free throw is put Tech on top by one by the way that was the first made free throw of the night for either team Ibrahim Suare has coming into the game to replace Matumbo lanin looks for the contact cant finish Davis cleans it up great work that time by Davis on the offensive blast and Doug if Im Syracuse Im going back at lampin let him get a touch in the paint hes got a clear size Advantage jvon McCollum still having a quiet night offensively and then he picks up the foul at the other end well we mentioned it earlier were going to take a trip down and the Arizona Wildcats actually came here to the then called Carrier Dome and took on Lawrence moton and the orange this was 30 years ago and stmy played very well 22 points on five of seven shooting from Beyond The Arc Syracuse won the game though 9484 Lawrence mton went for 25 points but that year stamer averaged 22 points seven assists per game and was a consensus first team AllAmerican and when we asked him today what his memories were of playing here in this building two word answer we lost its all he cares about we lost dont care that I had a good shooting night all I remember is we lost yeah I remember trying to guard that guy out in Maui we played that team him kid re the back Court of Arizona and what a career he had as a player and now building that career as a coach well you didnt tell me the answer did Arizona or did Boston College win that game out in mou is that why you didnt say it you know theres if you won Im sure youd have said Eagles beat the Wildcat but it didnt come up so I figured well you just had to add that in there all right sh how did he do how did you do yeah it was a battle we had a really good back cour all those guys out there that went on to play professionally Le Reeves Howard I Le obviously Damon we talked about is so lot of fun lot of fun memories well Damon Styers told us that what he got from that time from lud Olson the Hall of Fame head coach of Arizona was his attention to detail its something hes carried on to his own coaching career he spent time as an assistant coach in the NBA now in his second stop as a head coach at the division one level he got a foul on the floor on that rebound that goes against Applause Music Suare and you know what Damon STM has himself a terrific first lieutenant with him somebody youve known for a long long time he knows the Syracuse Yukon history from his playing days Carl Hobbs the associate head coach for Damon stmy and when Damon came back from the NBA hed been in the C with the Celtics for a couple of years you need somebody like Carl Hobs to help you build this program yeah former head coach himself as well too and again I used to go up to stores watch that guy play he was instant offense Off the Bench uh for Yukon carhs the assistant coach now for George great look by lampin Davis able to finish over the taller Suare L DAV thats great interior passing and again the focus on getting the ball into the paint both teams really struggling good execution and patience that time by Syracuse Georgia Tech could use McCollum getting going he still has only one made basket all Applause night Starling Lin turns it over he and Davis miscommunicating on that bounce pass here comes mustaf with a full head of steam lanin got a piece Taylor quickly out to Bell doesnt have numbers but he attacks good Hustle by lanin to get the offensive rebound hes able to save it back out to Applause Davis Starling great first step to get around McCollum and that first step thats what makes him so special his ability to get get into the paint that time miscommunication on the high ball screen starlings got 10 and the Syracuse lead is five D at the point guard position tonight as Adrien ay shuffled his starting lineup yet again having uh jquan Carlos coming off the bench we havent seen as much of Kyle cuff as we have become accustomed to in recent weeks with Starling now healthy and back on the floor Terry Euro Step around lampin for two and that takes great lower body strength to shift Euro and then a recoil go up that is a tough move by Terry again his ability to get into the paint and then finish really some of the best in the ACC Lance Terry leads all scores now with 11 Syracuse has couple of 10point scores in Starling and Taylor Lins pass taken away by McCullum he lays it up over the rim for two great anticipation and you know coach red a talked about it not just his guards but bigs turnovers like that they got to be better out of the double team make quicker decisions make a simple pass back out Taylor Bell and Starling around the perimeter JJ looks up at the shot clock which is down to five pulls the trigger on a long two Matumbo with a rebound Georgia Tech with a chance to retake the lead column can heat up in a hurry gets it back from mango locked it toward the rim broken up by lanin and thats great read by by lampin that time breaking up that lob B loves that Applause corner watch where Georgia Tech sets their ball screens again they set these ball screens on the side its kind of a weird angle and then theyll roll The Bigs Georgia Tech showing off great anticipation right here a steal and finish we got a close one at Syracuse you do 44 and you sleep come on man I I I thats thats impressive though he went 44 to get those sneaks in Ill tell you what that young man is going to go home very happy and this game right here though Doug appropriate it has been physical its been a very physical game low scoring game 1139 to go but uh both teams really have struggled and a big reason why uh the physical defense that both teams playing the strength of matambo to finish plus the foul to go up and through Eddie lampin who is 611 265 takes a lot of strength in his own right I mean that is a big time finish and you said it absolutely right that is going strong all set up by Lance Terry getting into the paint nice little dump off pass to Matumbo and we talked about his father dmbe the eighttime NBA Allstar twotime Big East defensive player of the year at Georgetown and unfortunately we lost to kembe died of a brain tumor at the age of 85 back in late September Ryan Miss Techs first nine games of the season after his dads passing but as I mentioned in the first half the kenbe loved coming here to the Dome and fing in that marvelous rivalry between the ho and the orang men Dongo has a chance for three the yellow jackets on top by three were seeing some great transition offense this is what Georgia Tech wants to do nice little pass by George and Dango with the finish and that is a nice Touch by George and then nango we talked about it last year all ACC freshman team came back added some weight and bulk to his frame and coaching staff ravs about his potential being a matchup problem in the ACC eight unanswered Georgia Tech points for the Yellow Jackets largest lead of the night Starin answers and ties the ball game at 38 and thats why theyre a different team Within on the court when you need a bucket I said it earlier he is that guy similar to Judah minz last year for this team JJ Starling he is that guy for this Syracuse team goes mum to indongo movich got a PE that is his third block shot in only 9 Minutes Off the Bench movich also with a steel and then he is fouled by indongo and uh Damon stym not happy with and Dango again these are the fouls he needs to avoid again you get your shot block you like your aggressiveness but you cant pick up fouls like that not a good play that time but excellent uh defense by B misses Movic gets it back to him Bell was blocked Lampton continues to be active inside and thats the key word Ive been impressed with his activity offense and defense uh hes done a lot tonight his energy really has been high mcum sweet touch along the Baseline tied at 40 now Javen McCollum played his first couple of years of college basketball about two hours East of here at Sienna College in Albany and he told me before the game that he going to he was going to have nine different friends making the trip along the New York state 3way to watch in person there another Upstate New York kid JJ staring hes got 13 points and Lin wont get credit for it but he set a beautiful screen to free up Starling that time excellent screen and then R screen using his uh big body to free up staring thats now 15 for Starling Mato lost it couldnt handle the pass Dongo turns it over mustaf who had a really good first half still scoreless in the second half returns to the lineup replacing Lance Terry he grabs a seat with a team High 11 points yeah again right here I think both teams depth uh getting deep into this game its been a physical game and both teams trying to get guys in and out trying to keep legs fresh to finish this game Applause out movich calling for his teammates to come back to him Starling does and now the ball into the hands of jquan Carlos the Hofer transfer coming off the bench for the first time as a Syracuse Orange this game number 15 on the a my storic with an excellent entry pass and Eddie lamin lays it in you cant execute it any better high low lampin did a great job sealing but my starage that pass Applause perfect McCollum myovich again giving good minutes off the bench for the Applause orangs L backing down Suare over the left shoulder count the bucket and the foul well the patience and thats a great recognition by Syracuse going right back well to lampin again the help is not there early ear they were doubling that it doesnt come lampin sees it goes in and one and rocks the baby and his energy again going back to it on both ends uh look Georgia Tech has put him in a lot of ball screens uh he has been active on both ends for Syracuse yeah all eight of his points have come in the second half you see the nine rebounds four of them have come since the break and the big fella played last year with the Colorado buffalos makes it for Applause 740 George pulls up and connects well thats going to be there well lampin is not going to come out and heads hard on screens that was part of the plan Syracuse they want to make George a shooter so again uh use that ball screen if youre George that pullup jumper will be there uh throughout the uh the close out this game Carlos onehanded pass lampin is fouled on the reach in no before the foul could be called lampin stepped out of bounds so itll be Yellow Jackets basketball when we come back Syracuse 47 Georgia Tech Music 42 look at you my man one of five theyve only taken five free throws so the refs are letting them play so Starling is on the bench coming out of the under eight timeout Adrien ay I imagine trying to get him a quick rest to bring him back in if they can hold out to this fivepoint lead its been close throughout Syracuses biggest lead was a few moments ago at seven the yellow jackets have led a couple of times briefly by as many as three George back to nongo not a threat from the perimeter under control Movic is going to pick up the personal Applause foul that is the third personal foul on my stovic well were super excited about the first gymnastics meet of the season on acc Network Friday night at 900 Eastern well have the quad meet with Clemson NC State Arizona and Michigan State which is the first of three quad meets this weekend in Oklahoma City Applause free throw shooting has been a problem for both teams havent gotten there much tonight and when they have gotten there Malcolm they have not shot it very well no they havent obviously uh missed opportunity trailing five but mustaf has been solid uh for Georgia Tech on both ends offensively in that first half and defensively unable though to convert from the Freo line the yellow jackets are 1 for seven from the line tonight the orange only one for three Danga and movich picks up his fourth foul another Syracuse Applause turnover and so movich will head to the bench with those four fouls J Davis and JJ Starling will return mum in and must stop out for Tech and thats a good foul though by my stovic again to turnover but then to break it up and thats not even a shooting foul so again a break up would looked like its going to be a uncontested layup or Applause dunk Terry traveling even though Terrys got 11 points hes their leading score on the season at nearly 16 team per game its been a tough go for him I mean all around everybody both teams uh defensive energy and effort and again credit the refs theyre consistent on both sides so again you drive in the lane in this game uh you better take care of the ball if not both teams very active uh in the passing Lanes the orange looking to avoid their first 0 and4 start in ACC play since the 20156 season Im not sure Eddie lanin could have dunked that ball but he was thinking about it and the play set it up uh with the fake handoff right here again they think hes given the handoff but tumbo goes with him as well and youre right it looked like he was going to try to rip the rim off not sure uh hes That Bouncy but he certainly looked like he was trying to take flight the son of Vanessa and Eddie senior he grew up in Houston played at Morton Ranch High School and he is a budding entrepreneur hes opened up his own Southern Cuisine Restaurant right here in downtown Syracuse so you didnt tell me about that before so now I might have to hit that on the way out uh youre making me hungry right here but next time in next time in yeah hes you know good hes got great experience and size I love how he uses his uh body in this game right here uh defensively as well too hes done a nice job on the defensive glass uh but offensively they found him and hes done a nice job sealing and making his presence known in the pain I got it the 54 foul shooter gets one out of two the Syracuse lead is Music Applause six both officials on the perimeter saw it and called it simultaneously an offensive foul against the yellow jackets and Dam STM not much argument on that one right there Duncan Powell with the illegal screen in his third stop played a couple of years at North Carolina t in HBCU and then last year all the way into the West Coast played at Sacramento State or transferring back East to Atlanta timeout Syracuse red ay not happy about something it looks like he is looking at jier Davis as weve got ourselves a 30 second timeout here in central New York Music Music Music well the friendship between Adrien atrey and JJ Starling goes way back they first met when Adrien was a sevenyearold JJs parents Patrick and Satan say red is more like family to them the first time ay saw JJ play he knew there was something different about him there would be summer camps up at Manley Fieldhouse and uh JJ would go and here we are 15 18 years later and theyre still going at it great size and what hes meant to this team again weve shown the numbers you cant say it enough uh hard to win games with hes not on the court and you see what happens when they are right now though I like the change up Georgia te going to a little matchup Zone Lucas Taylor with five on the shot clock finds it open Chris Bell who left it short hes able to save his Miss to Davis deny at the rim and here comes Georgia Tech Stripped by Starling coach stmy wanted a foul call how showing the official where he says Starling got him on the arm consistency physical again uh you go in you better go strong in this game lets see if STM has a good argument yeah that one right there again looked like he got a lot of arm on that one apparently JJ had a little smile on his face afterward too maybe he knows he got away with one six minutes to go in regulation George uses the screen and buries the jump shot Ill say it again Nathan George is going to have pullup jumpers inside the threepoint line theyre just going under the screens so again thats going to be there thats not a bad shot along the Baseline Bell reverse nice set up that time by Starling again breaking down of that a matchup Zone if youre George you got to identify in that case right there Bell thats twice now hes been pretty open on the we George with the ball hes got 11 one of the two leading scores as that one roll off the rim little too strong off the Applause glass Starling waits for the ball screen from Davis now well set it back up now lanin comes up to set the screen rejected by number two in white tough shot blocked how got a piece Davis hustling for six to shoot bell with a tough lean howwell and Davis fought for it and its Syracuse basketball you may have heard on the microphone down that way Powell says I didnt touch it thats always the case guys uh lobbying the referees to see if they can gain possession lets see what here does here lampin has been a pretty good option for them see if they can get him a touch or put this guy right here Starling na a ball screen let him go to Applause work he played his freshman year at Notre Dame was an all ACC freshman team member tough Runner no Lin Taps to himself Bell off the shot F starling Syracuse has its largest lead of the night 5244 well everybody fooled on that one they thought the ball was going to hit the rim air ball Starling in perfect position to catch it and put it back in Syracuse four minutes away from picking up what would be its first win against a power conference opponent on the season JJ Starling in his second game back is leading the way screens in particular with lampin but put him in a high ball screen let him work from there Lins not going to come out and hedge I like that option for a Georgia Tech and then see if you can get the ball out of stens hand on the other end Tech continues to struggle on this end of the floor only three of 16 on threepoint shots Starling knocked that ball out of bounds Tech will keep it underneath and also the rebounds have been a complete switch from the first half the orange have dominated in the second half and again Eddie Lins been in the middle of it hes got himself a double double 10 points 11 rebounds for the big man George from the free throw line no Howell fouled by Lin and another problem area for Georgia Tech has been the free throw line only one out of seven as a team and there havent been many you mentioned it before and theyve not capitalized on that those opportunities you said it one to seven thats six freebies left on the table and another Miss from the free throw line foul on the year only 67 out of the stto high school in Texas from the Dallas area two another rebound for lampin well Georgia Tech season low terms of points was 56 against Duke on December 21st and if you were betting man coming into this one against the Syracuse team that has struggled mightily on the defensive end you wouldnt think Tech would struggle as they have scoring the basketball Lankin to the corner Taylor thought about it Davis couldnt handle the pass Terry driving on Bell count the basket its going to be basket interference on JJ Starling well he hit the backboard first uh without getting the ball I think uh this call is going to stand yeah again I think he hit okay now again that angle he may on review for possible go but the officials have to call go ending to be able to go over and review it exactly so if they have any sort of doubt theyre going to blow the whistle so they can go take a look yeah and thats closer from that angle again same as in the first half we were blocked from the angle we had strong move Im not sure if he got the ball I think this angle is much better to see if he got the ball first tough to tell in that situation right there this is obviously a crucial two points under review right now 326 to go Georgia Tech trailing by six now the yellow jackets have the possession arrow the only person in foul trouble so far is Peter movich The Freshman forward for Syracuse who has four M that looked like it might have hit the black the ball may have hit the backboard first so I think that based off of that or if its something they cant determine I think obviously the call on the floor has to stand after review the basses counts so it is a goal against starling and this crowd of just under 14000 at the Dome not pleased and and I think thats the right call it looked like the basketball hit the glass first before he was able uh to block a great effort and hustle play by Applause Starling Starling and Davis Bell lampin and Taylor out there for the orange Terry picks up defensively on Starling Taylor spotting up long rebound grabbed by Javen McCullum George uses the screen keeps the dribble creates space and hits the midrange shot thats the area that he has improved last season really came out of nowhere under recruited had a solid freshman year and then got in the lab with David stmy and staff and really has worked on his midrange thats a tough Applause pullup Taylor off the curl back to a sixpoint Game Rick check that its Chris Applause Bell coming off a game where he had 18 Off the Bench against jordis Taylor grabs the air ball and now Syracuse in no hurry with 220 on the clock Music Applause Applause Lampkin five on the shot clock just under two minutes to go Lin tries to go to the left hand good job defensively by Powell well the double came late and thats a great job by and Dango Applause how crosses over Davis down the lane to the left hand big bucket for the yellow jackets well what Georgia Tech has done theyre doubling getting the ball out of starlings hand if he calls for a high ball screen look at indongo right now again hes looking to go give help number 11 defensively backs off with Davis starling looking to go to work from the right side for two not bad defense thats just a big time pullup by JJ staring 19 for Starling Taylor and lampin converged on a double team and thats the uh foul on lampin and will send Georgia Tech to the line for a one and one again right here lets see yeah again based on the way the game has been called R red has a pretty good argument right there Lin in pretty good Applause position Terrys a 73 foul shooter its the first he will take the bonus he came off the bench the first five games of the year until McCullum suffered a concussion November 23rd against Applause Cincinnati the senior out of College Park Georgia makes a pair 5652 just over a minute to play and now I think theyre going to just come double try to get the ball out of starlings hands timeout Syracuse thatll leave red ay with one with 553 seconds remaining you can see autri still displeased about that last call now he goes into the Huddle again Syracuse is 6 and8 on the year as we get the game reset still looking for that first elusive win against the power conference opponent hard to believe were Midway through the season and the orang has yet to pick up one of those well uh the way JJ Starling has played uh they were without him in a lot of those losses again still you coaches understand fans they dont want to hear it but theyre different team with JJ Starling healthy and in the lineup uh their defensive effort tonight certainly something that uh coaching staff has to be pleased with they got to close this game out though right now four uh you got a fourpoint lead uh starlings going to have the ball in his hands I got to imagine though Georgia Techs going to try to get the ball out of his hands somebody else is going to have to step up and make a play thats what I would do if Im Georgia Tech get the ball out of starlings hands let somebody else make a play well Starling and lampin have been the two best players for Syracuse lamin with his fourth double double of the Year 10 points 12 rebounds hes gotten up and down the floor well it seems like certainly the back issues he had earlier this season are a thing of the past spotm has the Freshman Jaden mustaf guarding JJ Starling charling gets around him good help by andong go Davis left alone from the foul line a big 15footer for the 67 senior from Newark Delaware and thats a great read by Starling again he doubled didnt force it Terry over the close out of Taylor for three time out George attack its a threepoint ball game with ice in his veins Lance Terry remembers what its like to knock down threes in this building and that right there again lampin hes playing drop coverage so hes not there on that screen if youre the guard you got to almost not let him get over that thats a tough task nice little action that Georgia Tech ran to get him open and man what a game this has turned out to be no doubt uh first half defensive struggle uh late in this second half both teams executing at a high level well that was Georgia Techs first made three in about 17 minutes of game action came at a big time it really did again off the action you know now Syracuse uh Georg Techs going to double uh they doubled last possession Davis stepped up made a nice shot any ball screen or isolation of theyre going to get the ball out of JJ starlings hand somebody else has got to be ready to step up again and make a play Yellow Jackets now out of timeouts Syracuse has just the Music one Georgia Tech coming off a win over Boston College Saturday theyre third in a row in that game they shot 59 from the floor now just a few days later its been tough sledding trying to make a bucket now they need to get a stop and get the ball back and obviously substitutions uh coming in now uh have to get the ball in uh if for Syracuse 27 seconds left obviously uh theyre going to try to steal theyre going to go for a steal key thing is you cannot turn the ball over you got to get it and in play you know theyre going to fou if they dont get the steal right away now Syracuse has already turned it over 18 times tonight trying to win in spite of that George ter Dongo Applause mustaf and Suare is on the ball as jier Davis runs the Baseline Starling is fouled and so they will walk to the other end of the floor thats the seventh foul against Georgia Tech and so Starling at 68 check that at 67 on the year we shoot a one one and Syracuse had the football lineup everybody on the Baseline now they had somebody going long as well Music too right there though Georgia Tech almost came up with a turnover now keying is making some free throws and certainly if youre Syracuse this is the guy you want on the line dun pow is returned for the yellow jackets Peter movich for Syracuse back to a two possession game if for Georgia attch again in this situation 271 seconds left you dont need a three make or miss here uh you can get a quick two set up your defense again see if you can force a turnover thr Starling 6055 orange Georgia Tech taking a lot of time Dango finally puts it up rebound Chris Bell Tech has no other choice but to commit the Applause foul that play took long to develop a for Georgia Tech again they opted and Dango that time with a three but certainly had plenty of time to drive the ball slow developing play and that did a great job on the defensive glass we will get you down to the dean Dum just as finish with as soon as we are finished here the Tar Heels and the Mustangs of SMU have yet to get underway doing it without the Freshman Donnie Freeman sidelined with what has been announced today as a lower right leg injury that right foot is in a walking boot two big free throws for Chris Bell who has been good again coming off the bench for the orange Terry oh Let It Go long rebound and that will do it Syracuse takes down Georgia Tech 62 255 a sire relief for red ay
