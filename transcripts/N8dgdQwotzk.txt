and plays that way this North Carolina State team can be dangerous NC State at 18 and 14 Syracuse 20 and 11 and still has hopes with an NCAA Bid And when their backourt is good for the orange it is off the charts good Judah minz right in the thick of that his first pass cant be finished up but it will be eventually on the dunk by Brown this is the interesting part right here for me when you thinking about the size advantage that NC state has with DJ Burns in the post you see Kevin Keats wants to go to him immediately where cell will fire his first shot wont drop Syracuse comes away with the rebound Marcel 25 points against Louisville yesterday give you a look at the Syracuse starting lap Starling mince Taylor Bell and brown Bell one of those orange Shooters who just went off against the wolf pack in one of those two victories his first half in one of the games he had 20 six yeah it was eight for 10 from Beyond the threepoint Arc in that game hes actually had two games this season OB where hes been 8 for 10 as the shot clock gets down under three seconds M has to heave it and cant connect and diara snatching a rebound as we look at the wol pack starting lineup they had dropped four in a row before their win yesterday mconnell Taylor marel Burns and diara Dr missing on the three there Kevin Keat has told us he is a better player when he makes a three he has a different level of energy when hes made a three in the ball game great offensive rebounder and defensive rebounder as well but an elite Defender winter will take on the number two SE Duke at seven tomorrow Vince with a pull a pop and hell drain that you imense name to the second Team all ACC and Michael oconnell was great defensively for the wolf pack yesterday but hes going up against a different challenge here this evening having to defend that second teamer in Jud who averages close to 19 points a game and well see when DJ horn will enter The Fray DJ burns with it so much is likely to get through him especially if the wolf pack are going to pull out of wi tonight but when you watch how they defend DJ Burns when he has the basketball you see Malik Brown on the top side Justin Taylor just waiting in the middle of the paint for him to spin back towards the Baseline shot clock at eight and going to be a whistle here and a foul going to get Chris Bell on that one thatll be number one on Bell yeah fouling Jaden Taylor shooting the three and we watched Taylor yesterday OB after he made a free throw he got going he struggled to shoot the ball but once he saw it go through from the free throw line he really got going now three opportunities for him as he misses the first which the wolf pack took tremendous advantage of at the line yesterday red ay number one following a legend never easy but hes gotten Syracuse to 20 wins by winning six out of their last nine at his alma mater and your Alma moer M as well so you hear me leaning on that story of Syracuse still has a chance to get into the NCAA tournament I I believe they do absolutely and when you consider the fact of how good this team has been especially as of late they should be in the mix for one of those automatic bids forgive me not automatic be able to at large bit Mintz on the attack right up against the wall of red and drops it Applause in Syracuse off to a nice start here with a 61 lead morcel on the wing he will drive it Syracuse collapsing on him he cant connect diar with a dribble down double fake and its blocked from behind Brown got a hand on it and a whistle and a foul here against Syracuse two dament attacking the basket which he does so often seventh nationally in free throw makes this season he has no problem getting to the rim putting his head down and taking on all comers once he gets to the bask Justin Taylor with the foul Burns gets the return working on Brown that should be an entertaining duel as he hits that one and DJ Burns has that ability hes had hes getting a chance to play oneonone vers Malik Brown however you see Judah Minch camping out right in the middle of the lane there will be someone in Hell position all the time waiting for the spin to the baseline from DJ Applause Burns Starling with 26 against NC State one of those victories mince tough shot hits the deck he does that an awful lot but he bounces right back up and he heads to the line yeah he gets to the free throw line as much as anyone but you see defensively Judah Miss just staying there waiting for DJ Burns to try to come Bas line DJ Burns sees him in his vision but its not a true double team so you dont commit and give DJ Burns that passing Lane Min has drawn a team high of 179 Applause fouls and he makes 77 one of the games against NC State he hit 14 foul shots and 18 tries also LED the ACC in free throw attempts so when you have that happening from your point guard you got you got a lot of respect for Judah M whos playing in front of a lot of friends and family right here at Applause home not to mention his former head coach great to see Jim beheim here working the tournament with you yesterday Burns and backs it in hell be headed to the line the big fell looking for a threepoint play but Chris B in that spot its almost like a spy on a quarterback you dont double team until you see DJ Burns spin toward the Baseline but Bell gets there late allows DJ Burns to get into a shooting motion the contact and the and one opportunity 27 points against Duke he was outstanding in that game they lost the game but he was certainly the focus time and time again for a while had Duke on the ropes there and OB even going back to his game yesterday he had 12 points but he did it in 10 minutes and 41 seconds so wasnt on the floor much but was very productive in the time that he was the last foul was against Chris Bell thats two on Bell so he had to take a seat as we talked about he was out of his mind in the first half of the Su win at NC State with 26 points Copeland has it batted away mince grabs it as we approach 16 minutes to go in the half mince into that lane tried for a blind pass tipped out by NC State and Syracuse on top 86 and weve got our first media break now the great legendary Jim beheim is in the house were working him an awful lot here hey Jimmy brackets is up for all the task that come his way I was born with wings but sasis swooped in to clip them it crushed

coaches trying to orchestrate some magic and maybe a run to the NCA tournament they still both have hopes NC stay with 18 win Syracuse of 20 and 11 first ever ACC tournament coaching head coaching game for Adrien ay Kevin kees now in his seventh year has a lot of experience on the sidelines for the wol Applause pack Taylor gets it to morcel morcel had it knocked Away by Min and out of play andc State a team that rarely turns it over only about 10 per game and here comes DJ horn and the Wolfpack fans are delighted by that all ACC third Team 17 points per game 43 from three and the hit apparently is all right well see just how good well hes not all right but hes well enough to play and that is a big factor for the wol pack getting him back onto the floor if only for the threat that he causes with his ability to shoot at at that 43 you mentioned diara shot by morcel much too long Copeland batting the rebound himself nice job there in the corner Vader copelan now horn got back defensively there and harassing copelan knocks it away so he looks bouncy well hes excited to be on the floor in the ACC tournament but not as excited as this young man is I can tell you right now this is exactly what he was waiting for to come to the ACC tournament DC and see DJ horn have any of us ever been that excited about any Im not sure winning the lottery copelan bottled up downstairs got the pass free somehow Taylor couldnt hit the shot amazing he got that pass free the long jumper will be nothing but net by oconnell and oconnell was super aggressive yesterday 16 points for him with the absence of horn and Im thinking he wants to try to continue that level of aggressiveness with DJ horn on the floor Starling little too much on that one hes 33 from threepoint distance NC State jumping in front on the triple diar will swing it out Applause morcel Brown will launch it and got to go talk about unconvention again Malik Brown showing moar if you want to be unconven I can do the same this late at night the bank is still over any weird thing you can do I can do even weirder DJ horn with it here such an explosive score when hes 100 hes not right now with a hit situation cost him last nights game but they won anyway diara got it downstairs middle Brooks getting in strong and cant connect Mal Brown clearing the rebound and these two guys going at it you see quer copelan and DJ horn however before the game those guys were dapping each other up hugging talking to each other but once you step on this court between these four lines it doesnt matter how good of friend you are its all about the competition yeah Im sure you were there in your days at Virginia you played against a really good friend what what was that like oh yeah you talking about when I was cooking Rand childrens out here in the HC tournament that maybe thats what you were referring to I think youre going to get some sort of response but probably on social media would be my guess your is about to exp hes watching hell be texting but show me the lie thats all thats all show me the lie oh I know its all in love its all in Friendship unless youre out here though hes 90 ft and once you get out here here again and you got a lot of friends in this game we all grow up playing against each other and we choose our different schools and your friends off the court but everybody wants to win in the tournament Vince Scott Airborne wasnt exactly sure what to do with it Syracuse by two now the winter faces number to see Duke tomorrow at 7 pm here in Washington top four seeds get double buys as that one will rattle away the orange a team that can really score when they get it rolling they get 77 points a game last eight or nine games theyve really been piling up the points at 94 against Louisville at 86 against North Carolina 1149 to go here in the first half 13 11 Syracuse leading NC State this is when it was all love OB DJ horn quad cop it was all love there however no love

with confidence and in part by AutoZone get in the zone a great history at NC State I mean Jim valano 1983 who will ever forget that do yourself a favor if you dont know it Google that run by NC State Jimmy ve from the ACC tournament onto the National Championship in 83 and during the Golden Era of the ACC not only knocking off North Carolina but also Virginia and Ralph Samson ending Ralph Samsons ACC career but that may not have been the best NC State national championship the 1974 team in an ACC tournament played what is known as the greatest ACC game of all time beating Maryland where only one team can go to the NCAA tournament of course the wolfback went on to win the National Championship in 1974 terrific history mince on the attack will draw the foulc 1129 to go and thatll go against oh look whos here that will be my godam wiber how about that who still claims that it was a pass although we know it was a shot the late Lorenzo Charles with the nice Music alley and it was history and it was history with Jim valeno running across the floor looking for someone to H great visual there cin launches and swishes it in But Eric C only 26 out there but he was gigantic in one of their victories at NC State this year 258 rebounds and Copan also was the ACC player of the week after his performance against Pittsburgh and was second in the running for sixth man in the year thats tough leader and that was in the cylinder so no basket lets go to Angel guys as were about halfway through the first first half going back to NC States game last night coach Keats was talking about what need to carry over he said I love the way my team was sharing the ball they had 14 total assists all but one player had an assist after the night right now theyre sitting at one shooting below 30 so the energy of the ball right now is what theyre lacking to start the half yeah Angel and one of the things of course to get an assist you got to make the shot and the problem with that is North Carolina State four of 14 from the field only 1 for seven from Beyond The Arc a beautiful find from DJ Burns and this time J Taylors able to knock down the three ball transfer to NCC state after two years at Butler he was a good scorer hes about 13 points a game and averaging about 12 for Kevin Keats but hes been a great score as of late overing 19 points a game over his last five 18 in their matchup yesterday copelan straight on got a good look but off the back of that Applause iron lets see if horn gets involved offensively burns with a touch a tough angle but he makes a lot of those shots tell you what hes had a huge impact to start this game this North Carolina State team is different when DJ Burns is on the floor you have a post player to be able to play through but hes so unselfish that you have to pick your poison do you double team or do you just allow him to just beat you up one on one creative passer two Min L it gets it and hell go to the line Judah Min with a response and looking for a threepoint play fouled again we talked about juds ability to be able to get to the free throw line this time hell only get one opportunity because he has the concentration through the contact to still be able to knock down the midrange jumper Jud off to a great start eight points for him already three of six from the field two of two at the line you cant say the same thing about DJ horn thats his second foul and he has has to go to the bench in fact he is going to go down the tunnel maybe yeah he is headed toward their locker room once you get warmed up especially when youre dealing with the injury you get warmed up you have to stay warmed up difficult at this point for DJ horn to go sit down and try to come back in starting the second half most likely with the two fouls he wont play the remainder of this first have to find a way to keep heat on that hplex from the elbow cant hit it use in transition a pass brown with the slam but mince with the dime yes and D Miss puts on the goggles after the pass and now a steal by mitz gives it away Taylor no foul on that one here comes Jaden Taylor on the opposite end of the floor try to go end to end and NC State will clean it up but I love the consistency I love the consistency there was no call on one end for Justin Taylor theres no call on the other end played completely the same way defensively by both big men staying vertical so no call for either Taylor but Di there with the second chance points DJ horn we gave a shot of that back to the bench but again8 and A2 minutes before the break and the pullup wont fall oand off the mark Syracuse by three OK Connell coming in 29 beyond the threepoint line Burns trying to get a better spot and he once again gets great bounce that terrific ability to find the goal and OB Malik Brown is a first team all defensive player in the ACC and its nothing against Malik Brown but if there was ever a time to use the hes too small s yes thats it he is too small to guard DJ Burns many are yes this is true he should not feel alone in that right hell give it to oconnell for a triple got it Michael oconnell On Target and NC State on a seven nothing run but Adrien arrey having a conversation with cup when you leave as we watch Judah minz getting out in transition you see the point guard eyes as he drops the dime to Malik Brad who drops the hammer and of course

with a beautiful crossover tight layup at The Rim great early finish up 14 in total control back to obca and the Angel Michael cuff making a tremendous mistake defensively as you see him go after a basketball that he should not do 737 to go before the break and Starling will bring it up now for Syracuse and among their victories this season the two over NC State so trying to make it three this season he beat the wol pack by four NY stay by 12 inside the Dome oh we saw Adrien Ary getting upset at one of his Defenders giving up to three as we see the travel by Taylor as we get an opportunity to go back and look Michael cuff as you watch him trying to go after the basketball when you have a great passer like DJ Burns you cannot gamble Burns will make you pay for it each and every time as he does okono knocks down the three ball but look at Adrien Ary look at coach he is heated right now Obie waiting Taylor on the other end knocked Away by Min to prevent a dunk yeah he was heated it all right he was also caught in Corys cone which is another place you really never want to be well I can tell you right now theres his mentor is here in the building watching that and Im certain he was proud of Adrien Ary for making sure to meet C on the floor to let him know his displeasure in the defensive gamble that did not pay offel kept the foot down but the shot wont drop mince charging out of Applause there Taylor taking a with that left hand no Brown tried to scoop it up loose ball again and taken in by Starling and Syracuse will set it Applause up copel shot clock down to Applause seven Starling from the elbow got it and thats been the difference in my opinion OB in the Syracuse team in the second half of the Season JJ stalling has had 15 consecutive games in double figures he was not looking to be aggressive early but he has found his offense complimenting J to mention that backward DJ Burns trying to zip the pass inside and a whistle and Adrien arrey talking to his team letting them know they have to either decide whether to come fully with the double team well coming up on Sunday selection Sunday it all starts at six Sports Center in the ESPN recing the guys look at the mens field of 68 as the brackets are announced followed by Bracketology breakdowns of each region at eight the womens field is revealed with Bracketology as well and a complete breakdown immediately following and DJ horn back on the floor playing with those two fouls had a good look off of What DJ Burns find Nifty spin there by copelan couldnt get the basket but hell be headed to the line but here Copeland the sophomore from Philly and fouled on the play by Jaden Taylor who picks up number one here good to see horn back on well and one of the things with Kevin Keats its its difficult once he gets going to sit him down when youre dealing with the hip flexor now youre talking about getting stiff and now try to be able to try to come back and play in the second half would be you know virtually impossible if you do tighten up so I respect Kevin ke getting him back on the floor but also trusting his fifth year guard to make sure he doesnt pick up that third foul have you ever played with anything like that I have I I Ive had pretty much every you can imagine so and I work with the hit flexer daily right now burs at the line getting a little bit closer A Little Fall Away a big rebound by the got it to oconnell on the low block for two and that was all Mohamad diara and if you look at what has been the issue for the orange throughout this season theyve been outrebounded by 66 rebounds a game in ACC play that is where they struggle we talked about they dont have the largest front line in the size to match up with NC State tell you what theres a lot of orange in this building orange travel yeah he certainly do orange travel well and here for the ACC tournament looking for a bit of a Magic Carpet Ride mince had it knocked away still a loose ball he hits the deck kept the dribble hell heave it up there and it was a shot clock violation he did not get up in time Copeland doing a great job keeping Judah Min away from the official and and right now Judah Min fortunate quader copelan may have saved him from a technical foul on that possession up playing with a lot of fire the officials are Roger SS Tony Henderson and Jamal Spearman yeah Tony Henderson was very lent on that possession give tony a lot of credit because it would have been easy to hit J to miss with a technical foul on that oconnell on the dribble Taylor trying that Baseline sling underneath but he made the shot that was a brutally tough shot yeah Taylor not just a shooter showing off his ability to attack the basket and finish through contact so NC State by two were going back and forth and back and forth might be that way all night here in Washington we hope so R OB absolutely copelan seven to shoot it working on morcel now a double Taylor came over to help shot clock is down to one Min has to get it up cant hit it and Syracuse knocked it out off Taylors hand two to M hesitated on that shot looking at the shot clock when you know you got to get a shot up thats a confident time to be able to shoot it theres nothing else for you to do just catch it and shoot it knowing that shot clock is down under three seconds so the wol pack with the ball up by two they had dropped four in a row before their win yesterday Over Louisville and turnovers were such a big part of that it absolutely was on the drive and scooped up and in by JJ Starling mentioning at 26 against NC State one of the wins at 22 against Miami 23 against North Carolina Syracuse buckling down defensively mince gives it up his St from the corner hell get a second chance Starling cant finish on the Run nice five Taylor will draw the foul 324 to go before the break here at Capital One second round of the ACC tournament ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is brought to

maybe a little quick look at pit and Wake Forest in tomorrows 4 five match up also big 1200 in in action which you highlights there here tight one clearly tight absolutely keep going into DJ Burns let him pass let him play hes playing with tremendous quickness tonight theyve got to do a better job at NC State though keeping Syracuse out of the paint a lot of pullups theyre a little too open dancing bear always a problem so is CA and OB back to you you aint lying D thank you coach Ken thank you very much see you guys at halftime and for moreon Mohamad diara the big Junior from France lets toss it over to Angel as every team has mentioned the importance of nutrition and refueling during this tournament but those who are also recognizing Ramadan for the next month are put in an even more unique situation in States Muhammed diara actually is currently fasting which means he will not eat from sun up to sun down the teams dietician Jesse McGinley stated that he had a big meal last night ate around 545 this morning and wont eat or drink anything thats including water until sunset in DC which was marked at 714 at night they started pushing fluid and food during the timeout of this game so thats something to keep your mind on how hes finding that energy for tonights game well angel I can remember playing against a guy who DJ Burns has taken a lot of his footwork from by the name of aim Alazan who also used to observe Ramadan and I can tell you now OB he was just as good during Ramadan as he was any other time he was spectacular always andc stay with the ball here and on top by two coming down the home stretch of the first first half heres diara with it as he puts it to the deck hunting a shot here off the fake you see the difference for Malik Brown and Lead Defender and how you take on someone like the r in comparison to how he has to guard DJ Burns and the difference in the pressure that DJ Burns puts on your Music defense Marcel will pick up his first foul and DJ Burns whos played more minutes already in this first half tonight than he did in the entire game yesterday was had a huge impact nine points two assists already more importantly zero Applause turnovers mince left alone to fire it up there and thats not a good idea thats what coach Kareem was talking about in studio thats too easy for Jud Miss thats you know you get him to 16 17 ft thats a layup for judis to be able to knock that down with no defense sophomore from Fort Washington Maryland good first half at 11 middle Brooks will hand it off for Taylor Taylor trying to shred the D going in strong hes made a couple of really tough buckets he absolutely has but a lot of that has to do with the fact that outside of Malik Brown theres not much Rim protection for the orange Justin Taylor at 66 trying to man The Post in there and Jaden Taylor not concerned about Justin Taylor who was of course a wing coming out of high school trying to block his shot NC State holding off Louisville and a stunning performance by sky Clark 36 points yesterday 9485 victory for the pack to advance that was without their top score DJ horn they iced the win with 11 foul shots in the last three minutes made a ton of foul shots yeah they absolutely did it was this young man Casey morcel who made 13 for 13 and this time he goes to the tough bucket the turnaround over great defense B coper 25 against Louisville for him he was a big star in NC State with a 3329 lead coming up on a minute to go before halftime they hand off for Mintz now Starling Starling with a pull up pop and drains that one a triple OB you mentioned in the open JJ Starling averaging 19 and 12 points a game vers NC State this is a team that he has a lot lot of confidence playing against and a lot that has to do with you take your best defender and you normally put him on D the so hes getting to play against the second best defender and hes had his way marel looking to make a move on the spin cook got a hand on it the follow and a foul against Syracuse 387 left in the half youve seen some great battles Casey Morel quad Copeland going at it Morel winning this battle going to the step back and then JJ Starling Rhythm dribble off the screen and roll action knocking down a three ball hes been a different player as far as his confidence shooting the basketball during the last half of this season Le Brown just picked up foul number two so hes going to sit here for the rest of the half 23 Peter Peter car 611 sophomore in for the first time out of Sunderland Massachusetts Middlebrooks at the line the junior transfer from Clemson and we will see the Tigers later on tonight against Boston College yeah and youll see Jack Clark who was a member of the North Carolina State wolf pack last year so theres been rumored that that was actually a trade between the two teams middle Brooks for Jack Clark straight Applause up Copeland had to d a pass inside and stolen away the r comes up with Applause it 12 seconds before halftime 123 and a timeout to set up a shot here for NC States leading Syracuse here 3532 in round Music two begin he coming up tonight 1130 Eastern on the ACC Network to nothing but net crew will have a complete breakdown of todays second round ACC tournament games some great action earlier today Florida State 8676 over Virginia Tech Wake Forest a must win for Wake as the number five SE knocking off Notre Dame 7259 last seconds of the half the switch up by Syracuse going to the zone out of the timeout they want Burns to touch it flips it up there rolls off the 10 and thats the last shot of the half NC State will head to the locker room leading Syracuse here in round 23532 I love state but Jaden Taylor LED them with 10 as we are underway here in the second half Hy stay with the ball syu starting in the zone defensively OB to start this second half over the top M oh and a pretty catch and bucket and you are very familiar with this as of course youre Syracuse Alum The Zone often times forces a lot of turnovers Syracuse is has been notorious for leading the league in steals with Jim bound when they were playing the Zone Adrien arrey now going to the Zone here to start this second half after down two back to back turnovers for NC State who only had two in the first half mhm and usually do a great job of holding on the ball so Syracuse within one again the winner to take on the two seed the Duke Blue Devils who got the double bu to get into the quarterfinals Bell on target now he was in foul trouble s a huge Chun in the first half but thats his role hes the shooter on this team and great execution to get him a look early missed the final 16 minutes of that first half but knocked down his first three here so great sign for the orange there hell jump in and a whistle here with 1852 to go second half give a look at the shot chart on DJ burns the 69 grad he was super efficient in the first half OB scoring and also dishing North Carolina state is a much better team when they get the basketball in the hand of DJ Burns and more importantly when hes able to stay on the floor and out of foul trouble that incidentally was foul number three on Chris Bell and DJ horn back in for the wolf pack he missed last nights game because of a hip issue he was in and out of the lineup in the first half of this did not start for the wolf pack Min with a pull up drains it hes just getting to a spot so hes so athletic once he gets to a spot hes going to elevate theres nothing you can do as a Defender if you dont get to the basketball when hes on the ground there 15 points hes got a bunch of shots just like that horn with a pull up at the elbow and thatll go good sign for the wolf pack to see him hit a jump shot his first basket and I like the way Kevin Keys didnt wait nearly as long long in within the first two minutes of this second half MCE driving and going up hard with a rejection lets check in with Angel coach arrey has to be pleased with how his team is playing and starting off this second half he told me earlier he said we have to do a better job of taking care of the ball they had seven turnovers in the first half he said right now were not taking great shots we have to make sure were connected right now were seeing that in the second half and Angel for you as a former point guard you can only imagine how much that drives Adrien archery crazy as a former point guard himself you want to be the floor General you want to make sure that everybody is in the right place and with the right pace Taylor pulls up and Pops diad position and He will draw the foul the 610 Junior gets hit tied at 39 that foul will go against Justin Taylor number two 1992 Big East Tournament champion as a player Im surprised how many times Ive referred to him as Adrien arthury throughout this game instead of red instead of red cuz I know him as red of course and know him from that 1992 team where he alongside Archbishop Carol Alum Lawrence Molton won that 1992 Big East tournament lawence Molton of course leaving as the Big East alltime leading scorer who was happens to be from the DC area you know your DC better than anyone Ive ever met and so many great players have come from here so many so many great players coming from this area obob including we talk Syracuse the Pearl no no no sorry not not Pearl Sherman duck alltime leading assist in the NCAA when he left Syracuse program any great Syracuse players under Jim beheim of course on the Move Starling Taylor Twisted the pass inside but a shot clock will fire off here so thatll go back over to NC State Roger a underneath the basket on that call but his least favorite call in the game OB is your shot clock violation cuz Roger SS refuses to touch the top of his hair it is not going to happen by the way does anybody wear better shoes in all of college basketball than Roger does its not just the shoes its the entire outfit he gives me a rund down Burns every game off the window no the Arcane crashing in still a loose ball and a wild Scramble for it in the lane there 1704 to go 41 to 39 heres my guy stays sharp as Roger SS and again of course hes hes got his traditional outfit on as you see DJ Burns going to the basket unable to finish it but the scrum underneath trying to get the loose ball and see stayed off the inbounds morel great interior passing and burns will knock it down great recognition by diara though to know that as the help comes over DJ Burns is going to be able to seal his Defender and get the easy layup DJ with 11 mince at the foul line cant that one and diar with the Applause rebound NC State did not come to Washington DC a hot team they had lost four straight but played very well against Louisville big scoring game as they got 94 and trying to make it two for two batted Away by Miss shot clock down to seven right back to Taylor now burns on the high post trying to spin and a lot of iron but it wont drop he wins it back somehow a second effort and switched in by Taylor that was a crazy possession it was a crazy possession however it shows you the great hands of DJ Burns he was off balance he got a shot up on the glass but was unable to Coral the offensive rebound but getting his hands on it allowed jamee Taylor to find the three and that three that Taylor knocks down sends the wolf back on a 9 over Music go go Music we were made

round out yours Syracuse and NC State Toe to Toe here in round number two our first of the night session Dave OBrien alongside Cory Alexander and Angel gray what do you thought so far about the tournament Wake Forest with a huge win today as far as their chances for the NCAA tournament and a necessary win to set up what will be an absolute battle tomorrow with the pit Panthers in that four five matchup as JJ starlings able to get to the midrange Adrien archery now coming back manto man out of the timeout NC State figured out their way through that zone DJ horn trying to get free Airborne knocks it down we havent heard much from him in this game he came in averaging 17 with a bunch of big games four points Starling will slice in bit of a wild shot and a tie up on the play and a whistle so give you a look at the tickets punched so far as we are into round two of the ACC tournament among those James Madison St Marys with a huge win over Gonzaga last night in the WCC Championship yeah great win for the Gales and also Longwood so two Virginia teams Longwood and James Madison already punching their tickets of course you know I always got to keep up with my you are State you are the governor or or will be someday I have no doubt hell get out the boat Starling and brought from behind by Taylor so shut down for the wol pack we lead at 4841 hor will launch way down time but too strong another sens of rebound OB thats been the difference now 17 Second Chance points for the wolf pack in this game diara 12 rebounds six of those to your point offensive rebounds yeah hes been all over the glass but we talk about the smaller front line of the orange line driver by Bell wont fall and now the wolf pack starting to think about really taking control of this thing at the 14minute Mark horn for Burns and a whistle there and another foul Syracuse picks up another foul this one on Copeland is second and third fou and there third team foul Obie what Syracuse has allowed to happen without having to attack DJ Burns offensively theyd allowed him to stay on the floor and we know that NC States a different team when hes on the floor but he hasnt had to do much on the defensive end allowing him to save his energy for what he does so well offensively the big gets it down to diara low pass from rcel shot clock is at five and a deflection here that was with 43 on the shot clock and you know DJ Burns has to has something to say to modar shoot the basketball he dropped him a dime di threw it out to the corner in comparison to going up strong and dunking that I knew DJ was going to have words for him shot reset to 20 Sara flipped up and on hung on the iron for the longest time Syracuse wants to run mince on the attack cant finish that he s it back quickly defensively OB DJ horn did not realize that it was a that they had a 14sec reset of the shot clock but you see DJ Burns does realize that modar needs to shoot the basketball when he drops him a dime he wants him to go up strong and finish that Hopeland that spits free right to Horn and he stayed by nine e horn looking for room to operate its partially blocked Burns comes away with it though hell get a chance at it nowll be switched in by Taylor offensive rebound kick off of three always the best time to shoot the three the entire defense is in the paint trying to come away with the rebound they dont get it DJ Burns an elite level passer knocks finds Jaden Taylor knocks down the three ball look at this run 16 to two over the last 6 minutes and another F BN to Taylor back to Horn and hell aay it in on a big time fast break thatll bring on a timeout Syracuse NC State mince a little bit shaken up 5541 the Applause Music pack we row a Healthcare Company helping hundreds of thousands of

of your body weight with one weekly shot losing 15 to 20 of your body weight is possible with row get started at rco l20 well Judah Mintz upset moments ago after there was no foul called here looked like there was plenty of contact but his reaction after that he was really upset obviously shaken up but then complaining to an official un an unsportsmanlike technical as he complained to Tony Henderson who teed him up but if we go back to the first half Tony Henderson was very lenient with Judah minz on a possession where Judah Mintz actually went back back in the direction of Tony Henderson cord Copeland stepped in to keep him away from getting that technical foul Tony Henderson had had enough and of course you cannot show up an official especially with everyone watching the team on the bench and then Jud clearly frustrated and rightfully so however thats a possession of a play where he has to keep his cool because now you give NC State an opportunity to put points on the board the free throw line and the basketball back and they get the ball as well 82 DJ horn missing the first one but this game in the process of flipping big time in the wolf Packs favor horn making one of two and Min continues to get some treatment obviously upset but I think you make a great point about the official gave him room in the first half and again if not for the inant in the first half Tony Henderson may have walked away I mean he understands the frustration I mean officials Miss calls it happens horn with the theft horn with dunck it a giant swing here in the last three or four minutes Im going to say the hip flexor feels pretty good for DJ horn right now entry pass inside for brown and two 5843 that sna to 12 nothing run heres Taylor a swoop in and now the pack making all kinds of shots I tell you what with this backourt the way theyre playing right now this NC State team is dangerous Bell off the fake a three on the way but no Ln up ahead for Marcel even more dangerous when this guy has the basketball in his hand burns on the Baseline Taps his own miss the orange come away they need a long Applause run copelan off to bell bell will Swit in the triple hes the one guy that the orange have been able to rely on to knock down threes consistently throughout this year theyre going to need a lot more of that now trailing by 14 after North Carolina state has dominated the offensive glass and shared the basketball extremely well Syracuse needs a lot more of that remember though Bell hit 8 threes and a half against C State earlier this winter the swing for morcel around and out one and done another great look and great find from DJ burn Copeland long strides in there for a basket and now Syracuse kind of picking themselves up off the deck here they absolutely are and theyre following the lead of quader Copeland Who is the ier hes the guy that brings the vocal leadership for the orange and theyve gotten it back to 12 Judah minz on the bench as hes watched quadia Copeland get his team back in the Music game so a mini five nothing run here DJ horn yeah showing the bounce hes been known for all season long nice little run here for the Wolfpack trying to get back in this thing plenty of time 1043 to go yeah yeah okay George this ones for the prize intenso no cool definitely Music iced espresso what else Let My Hope let my to make us to make

four seeds waiting in the Wings North Carolina Pitts Duke in Virginia North Carolina number one Duke number two Virginia number three pit number four North Carolina back in action at noon tomorrow against Florida State OB I love Tuesday and Wednesday of the ACC tournament but its a different energy on Thursday when the big boys come in it is a completely different energy and of course the followings for those top four seeds will tear the roof off this building thatll be the quarterfinals here at Capital One Arena shot clock to six diara thats going to be an offensive as B went down he took the hit diars first foul now one thing I am concerned about OB is if my young guy when he enters the building tomorrow well Amo be wearing this shower cap that is a concerned Im sure hes hes watching and I am concerned about my boy with this shower cap on Im not quite sure how that happened I I can guess how it happened he was ready he was preparing for the champagne and he was prepared I give him credit for that Bell straight on sinks it a twopointer just like that its a 10point game OB NC State made a tremendous run however the orange have really been inspired since the technical foul from Judah Mitch even though Mitch is on the bench po copen has come in and taken overell shut down in the paint okell got a good look hes a dangerous shooter when he gets warmed up big basket from okano really to stop a little bit of the momentum from the orange as Joe de mitz steps back to the score table ready to check back into this one so as Jaden Taylor who played a fine game and hit 28 against Pittsburgh last weekend trying to work it too far underneath for the pass comes free to the wol pack oconnell will swing it Morell coming off 25 the double up on him heres oconnell again shot clock at 14 DJ horn did not score in the first half he has 11 in the second half that hips feeling better another shot from him and knocks back at three OB I believe he used the first half to warm up hes here now I I believe he has arrived DJ has made his presence fell thats a traveling violation no basket red Entre not happy NC State back up 66 50 Judah minz checking out the game after getting hit in the face no call gets the technical foul on Sportsman like but now checked back into the game with his team trailing by 16 a quick 60 run by the Wolfpack so for the moment that has quieted the orange faithful oconnell the pass to Middlebrooks tough catch lost it men goes down hard a free basketball Marcel off the middle Brooks and it poked from behind and out of bounds NC State will have possession now theyre going to head to the monitor 825 to go Obie you mentioned Syracuse still in contention for an NCAA at large bit this is a game that they need to try to keep those hopes alive and were seeing guys diving on the floor but their energy and their effort has been met and exceeded by the wolf pack in this game coach Keats last night said this is a team not just playing dangerous as you referred to earlier Corey but desperate he said Jolan already said four ACC teams are getting in that means 11 teams are in this predicament where they need the tournament to win he said this is a team that understands what they need to do together and so trying to make sure that theyre still in that conversation once this tournament is over guys by the way they had reset the shot clock werent supposed to do that and reset it to three after they did that so thats why they went to the monitor yeah they didnt feel as though Syracuse ever gained POS possession so no shot clock reset inbound Miller Brooks and will slam it down emphatically back to 18 here for NC State but that cant happen 3 seconds remaining the first thing you have to do is protect the basket you give up a wide open dump so the wolf pack putting a strangle hold on this one mince bodied up by Middlebrooks who commits the foul on the Baseline his first personal and theres really nothing complicated to say simple you just switch stay on the inside quader copelan either doesnt hear the switch call from Malik Brown or doesnt pay attention to it but leaves Ben middle Brooks wide open to catch and finish DJ horn whos at a great second half with 14 points did not score in the first half hes been a man here in the second half of the Applause pack interior passing inside for Malik Brown but of course Syracuse cannot afford to be trading baskets here with a wolf pack with 744 to go Andy stayed leading at 6852 and going to take a little time off the clock oconnell middle Brooks up to set screen morcel heres Taylor short another offensive rebound for the pack Taylor kept that one alive Connell bouncing for Middlebrooks heres Taylor open he missed a couple on that Applause possession just over seven minutes to go Jud no and Marcel a Applause rebound NC State the number 10 SE looking to knock off the number seven here tonight and move into the quarterfinal round the Duke Blue Devils the number two seed awaiting the winner at seven tomorrow in the Applause Music quarterfinals shot clock of factor now down to three midd Brooks lost the handle on Applause it coming up tonight after this game Boston College and Clemson number 11 and number six heres Marcel on the other end to slam it how often have we seen that from the Wolfpack throughout this game Kevin keatss Squad 16 and five when they win the turnover battle two and N when they tie or lose that battle that was the 16th turnover for Syracuse to only six for the wolfb and turned over here 559 to go well this was

the first game has been a battle fun to cover but how about this second evening game we got top 10 scoring big men Quinton post coming off a 30 and 13 game PJ Hall third in the AC in ACC in scoring First Team all ACC as well its going to be a battle of the bigs I cannot wait to see our second game tonight and what that is going to look like in the paint guys Angel when you talk with the Boston College faithful they told you that the game is going to have to be what and Ang speechless under 6 minutes to go here post by the way pretty much personally end of the season in Miami Hurricanes with that performance copelan looked like he got bottled up and he made the shot anyway Im not sure Angel heard me angel you talked with the Boston College faithful they told you the next game has to be what for them to be successful oh its got to be gritty not pretty these are some guys that are understanding they need to lay everything on the floor and and its been fun to watch them especially in that first game yesterday war will draw the foul and hell be off to the line with about 5 and 1 half remaining here Syracuse actually LED with 1830 to go in the game 39 to 37 they came out with a 72 run to start the second half Adrien archery switched to the Zone defensively got two quick turnovers against NC State we got off to a 72 run since then 33 15 in favor of the wolf pack and theyve used their defense in turnovers to be able to make that happen now this guy DJ horn with an outstanding second half with 15 points and another foul shot coming he didnt play against Louisville with that hip flexer but he warmed up today and then gave a thumbs up to the training staff he did have to leave for a bit for a chunk of time in the first half but he returned and returned with a Vengeance in the second he absolutely did picked up those two fouls early in the first half checked out Bell will launch and hit it such a good shooter he really is and we mentioned eight of 10 the last time these two guys these two teams played but unable to stay on the floor in the first half he would have been a Difference Maker not for not getting those two fouls itll stay on this end for NC State leading at 7257 midd Brooks to put it in war Airborne went for the back shot the tip wont go di shot wont go either finally knocked out by Syracuse but at this point OB the W Packer playing volleyball they just get it up on the rim and between Ben Middlebrooks and muhamad diara these guys are going after every offensive rebound theyve been so good that we havent even noticed the fact that DJ Burns has been sitting down for about the last 10 minutes cuz middle Brooks and Dr have dominated the offensive glass just back in and quickly a pass horn cant finish it and his passing skill is just off the charts when you watch him B speed somebody as Syracuse gets sloppy here and just throws it away DJ burns with such great vision and of course he can go over the top at 69 but hes got a tremendous touch on those bounces but OB hes told me I enjoy the double team I invite the double team because it allows me to be able to show my passing Acumen its easy to pass when its one guy garden and thats normally when he goes to work when hes got mantoman coverage but he loved the double team to be able to get his teammates Music involved they break the pressure horn comes out of there with it he flips it here for Taylor 440 left two DeMent right now having to defend DJ Burns one of those bounce passes Marcel and hell draw the foul as Malik Brown was a little late getting there 7257 ACC tournament round number two the quarterfinals coming up tomorrow as you say the big boys taking the floor and if you want to knock off one of those big boys we get your chance tomorrow North Carolina pit Duke in Virginia those are your top four seeds and and they are in action tomorrow as Marcel makes the first one with Carolina willll take on FSU at noon pit and Wake Forest at 230 Duke and the winner of this one at seven and Virginia taken on the winner of Boston College and Clemson at 930 look at those numbers OB eight points 14 rebounds and of those 14 rebounds seven of them on the offensive glass the most by NCA player in the ACC tournament since 2012 the great CJ Leslie doing the work on the glass back then moel making at 7457 former Virginia Cavalier and another throwaway by Syracuse which they have done over and over here in round two its been the most costly part of this game for red ay it really has been Syracuse has shot themselves in the foot when you consider the opportunities that they theyve had and squandered away with the turnovers now 17 turnovers 28 points off the turnovers a collision right there in midcourt with 421 on the clock as o Connell went down now DJ Burns he shows a lot of Personality a lot of emotion he absolutely has but always flashing that big smile and being a great teammate because he wants his teammates to shoot the basketball when he throws it to him back in the day I used to tell guys OB look I do the dribble I do the passing when I throw it to you you shoot it thats what thats what DJ bur is telling his team your turn now exactly cuz if I want somebody to dribble a pass Ill do that I dont need you to do that yeah he wanted di to dunk it yes he did on that last Poss we showed his reaction OK conell at the line 84 foul shooter Michael oconnell who has an economics degree from Stanford I think he might be able to get a pretty good job with that pretty much anywhere he wants to go hes going to run into some of you Virginia guys not bad to have that on the resume Min off for copelan his turn around that will go but four minutes to go in a big gap here more pressure from the orange weve seen crazier things happen now its going to be up to the Wolfpack to handle the basketball and be able to make their free throws which they did so well last night but good things happen when you get the ball in the hands of the big fella DJ burns with the soft touch around the rim 13 points for Applause him this impact has been so much bigger than 13 points hes dominated this game really without having to score a big number sure Applause has breaking the Press again uhoh you aint going to dunk it DJ Burns no hes not very gently off the window 80 59 NC State they were actually trailing in the second half but they have put this game on ice it certainly feels like with a tremendous run Copeland from the corner too Applause strong a 33 to3 r that they went on at a whistle and they were using all the their weapons as part of their attack and NC State loving it tonight here in Washington DC all part of champ Music week its time to begin the hunt to share the excitement and bake your tails off MMs for all fun kind the

down 10 and a half time not anymore now Tyler Perrys turned it on the defense has been very good but more importantly theyre in the paint anytime they want Kansas State the shot selection of Texas has been poor this half we and a look at the Philips 66 Big 12 mans Championship bracket Houston of course the overall number one in the country odd to see Kansas at number six huh absolutely and one of the things I got to give the Big 12 credit for can you remember you know five six years ago where Kansas won the Big 12 every year sure think about what theyve done they followed the ACC theyve got different styles of play now one of the reasons why Candace has done so well in the NCAA tournament as late because it used to be just Kansas and everyone else now when you look at the big 12 youve got the Kelvin Samson style of play which is a rougher more defensive side youve got different styles of play and I think that has prepared the Big 12 very well for the NCAA tournament which has allowed them to catch up to the ACC oconnell at the line making one to two Music and an 8159 NC State Advantage they have played a tremendous second half the wol pack okell will draw the foul coming out of there lets check in with Angel well Muhammad diara just got done with an extensive stret stretching session with some of the trainers and just a reminder he is recognizing Ramadan so he is not eating from sun up to sun down he was actually giving smoothies and food and fluids at the beginning of this game so I mean he may be needing a little salt maybe smoothie I dont know but at the end of the day its good to see him smiling and also the team taking care of his 32 minutes and 14 rebounds man did he play hard I can tell you right now I do a lot of stretching but I dont smile it doesnt feel as good as it does when he actually looked like he was enjoying it oh he was absolutely but hes enjoying the fact that hes been dominant in this game we talk about DJ Burnss impact on this game di just as dominant eight 14 rebounds seven of those on the offensive glass and when you look at the numbers throughout this game a 207 Advantage for the wolf pack in Second Chance points Muhammad di had a whole lot to do with that tell you another guy who needs to get some love is Jaden Taylor 18 points in this game 6 out of 12 three out of seven from the threepoint L Syracuse getting on the board 8361 NC State with a commanding lead inside three minutes to play itll be mince at the line will pack had five players in double figures in their win yesterday only four however Vs 14 rebounds and eight points classify him for you know we were going to call that a double double whenever you got seven offensive rebounds we well give you the double double for that regardless of the fact that youre twoo short now you have talked about DJ Burns though and playing only 11 minutes against Louisville they won that game but a different story tonight he was on the floor for you know 24 25 minutes and what the difference is against Louisville yesterday Brandon Hunley Hatfield attacked DJ Burns he had to defend in this game there was no one attacking DJ burn so he was able to conserve all of his energy he did not get in foul trouble and was able to conserve his energy for what he does on the offensive end of the floor and hes been Dynamic here this Applause even men gets bottled up there and the Baseline throws it away to oconnell little Brooks running the floor crowd thought he walked with that out in front its mince and mince with the Finish Syracuse will take a timeout but a 20point game with two minutes to Applause go 8363 the wolf pack opening it up in a huge way here in the second half whenever you talk about the DMV and especially youre talking DC you got to mention Arc Bishop Carol High School the George Leftwich gym of course the legend that is George Leftwich however in the hallway there is the standing of the man thats right thats Big John John Thompson in the hallway just monitoring the students as they walk through that would keep me in line yeah me too Alma moer of course Troy Weaver the general manager of the Detroit Pistons and Lawrence molon slow mo as you see jt3 who was not a Carol Alum but all a Gonzaga Alum right down the street where Judah Min actually went to have high school but of course John Thompson II recognizing the statue of his father that sits in the hallway of art Bishop Carol High School Is Dead one of the greatest coaches of all time and up against Jim beheim in the glory years of the Big East some of the greatest

to get the shot up blocked back at him and thats a shot clock violation my little bro Eric devendorf of course starring in that game now working with us at ACC network but let me ask you this when you mentioned billis rra and MCD which one of those three you think asked for over I mean asked for double pay for the fact that they had to do an additional 30 minutes no question it was MCD okay I was just checking that would have been my guess asked and I think got it actually Min in the paint floats it up there for two it just has not been enough of that to keep Pace with NC State in the second half he is 21 8365 with about a minute to go so the wolf pack will Cru CR into the second round this was a tight game for a long time but NC State theyve got a lot of weapons they really do and when theyve got their four perimeter players playing as well as they have when you consider oconnell Casey morcel horn and Taylor and then youre getting the production on the interior that they got I mean this was a complete game everyone that had on the red uniform was productive throughout this game now the last time Duke and NC State met that was in Raleigh Duke came away with the victory although Burns had a great game individually he had 27 points for the wolf pack but Duke came away with an impressive win on the road in that contest but Im sure as you look at the DJs DJ Burns DJ horn on the bench theyre looking forward to another opportunity against the blue doubles here in the ACC tournament on the line out of bounds 23 five to go and still to come for us on ESPNU itll be Boston College and Clemson NC State to celebrate an impressive win great second half by the Wolfpack they ran away with this one Syracuse LED 3937 with 18 12 minutes to go and then it was a 214 run by NC State to ice this victory and the Wolf Pack wins again I dont know is it going to be a Magic Carpet Ride for the wolf pack here in Washington its happened before
