to the Pete n era Cal uniforms today and Sack State comes in at one and three and Cals won their last two and the Golden Bears at 4 one trying to start the season 5 one for the first time since they began the 2016 2017 season seven and one Cal again without three key players in this one they did not play against Air Force on Thursday night as Christian Tucker out top with a timer at 10 Tucker left open spots up and he needed that shot desperately Roxy you took the words right out of my mouth that was a really significant shot for Christian Tucker hasnt been able to get off the schneide early in the year but hes a really talented player from UTSA and uh he can get some things done for the Bears when hes he was just 13 from the floor to start the season is Jacob Holt missing a three Andre sto yakovich the rebound and one and done and Cal brings it up but Tucker who last year averaged over 11 points per game in UTSA was really fighting it offensively he was doing some good things but maybe that first shot going down for him can get him going now as Andre sto yakovich Fires at three and the rebound tip free and its controlled by Jacob Holt Here Comes saak State well lets well see how the game goes but Tucker is a veteran player Roxy hes hes going to play with confidence no matter what and powering his way inside and drawing contact and Emil scoa the transfer from Central Michigan the native of Finland will get to the line for a Sacramento State you know even when things arent going your way and you mentioned shooting a low percentage you know still Christian Tucker is getting nine assists again nine assists for the season thats pretty good in limited minutes so I think with anything else you just need your confidence to get things going first foul on Cal and scooter at the line hes just one for five from the line so far this season he started out each of the first five games as you look at Michael zeppel the interim head coach of Sacramento State and well get into the story of him becoming the head coach for the Hornets as the second one pinballs out last Touch by sack State and a CAL ball with the Golden Bears Up 3 to one almost a minute and a half in but Michael zeppel who has been the last couple of Seasons the associate head coach to David Patrick at Sacramento State and previous to that spent four years with Mike mpeo as at The Rim mty Soko was fouled and well get to the line and Im a big Mike mpo fan down in UC Riverside I think hes a really good coach and thats who Michael zeppel worked with before coming to Sacramento State with David Patrick and then abruptly in May toward the end of May which is an odd timing for coaching change as the first free throw in by Monty Soko as the foul was on Emil scoa of Sacramento State or correction was on EJ Neil of the horn its not scoota but on May 22nd David Patrick surprised Mark Gore the athletic director at Sacramento State by telling him he was leaving to take the associate head coaching job at LSU yeah thats late Roxy you know theres a lot of coaching changes but thats particularly late in the game but uh you know new coach now having to put his mark on the program and hes going to play with a lot of European style and and hes going to do some things a little differently which is unique to college basketball stay at this end with Sacramento State and so when David Patrick informed maror as Andre sakovich knocked it away last Touch by sack State Lan Brewer and it belongs to California they immediately elevated Michael zeppel to the interim head coach and well see how it plays out for him will he get the job will Mark or look in a different direction but it certainly caught everybody off guard ball poked away in a steel EJ Neil drives in in the finger roll and Neil is a big contention of fans here today well Roxy i i might been in those shoes Ive been an interim coach and so you want to try to coach the team the way that you can coach uh youre not you know youre not really auditioning as much as you just you you have to worry about the team first if if he can do the job uh good things will happen but you cant you know do anything thats out of out of your personality three pin balls in and out for Joshua Ola Joseph and its controlled by the Hornets Julian vs in the key drop off to Jacob Holt nice pass out of the double team to a cutting Amil scoa and Sack state has tied the game well Cal had a really good double team Roxy and usually you dont get split like that because you take away the inside shoulder but there was a gap and he found the Gap perfectly for the uh return pass for Lup and you see Hol clearly a good passing big which is key in this offense for Sacramento State Andre St yakovich straight on and a long rebound grabbed by Julian vond and here come the Hornets looking for the lead scooter barrels his way in and Sack state has scored six in a row and they lead at 75 I like the sophomore scoa the way hes playing Roxy hes aggressive he gets to the rim and this Zack States teams coming in here with really uh maybe a little bit of an edge because theyre playing aggressively I like it Emil scoota with five of the seven for the Hornets and a pass deflected by Neil run down by Joshua Ola Joseph for Cal still 10 on the shot clock short clock heres Christian Tucker five to shoot Tucker Ola Joseph thats a deep two and and the rebound trickles out to Christian Tucker Cal gets a fresh 20 Ola Joseph a clean look this time and the rebound and a foul and its on Cal and were going the other way in a sack State basketball yeah not quite the start that I know Mark Madson and staff would like uh here because you you want to make your mark in this game and you want to make it defensively I think sometimes theres an emphasis to get on the board but you want to put your identity down there Cals been really good defensively when and when they have been good theyve been a much better Team Jacob Holtz three well thats the problem Roxy if you get out to the threepoint shooter theyve just been driven the last two times so that makes it even tougher to guard hes got to get their Rhythm now defensively nine nothing Run for the Hornets and Hol coming off a career high 20 a loss to Seas Sun last week and the Slam by Monty Soko you know if you want to solve the problem get the ball in sokos hands he knows what to do hes really tough to the basket hes a load uh hes a presence inside last Saturday sack State losing by 10 at home to the matadors from sees sun and thatll take us to a timeout but a good start for Sacramento State here on the road yeah theyre knocking down shots Roxy if youre Sacramento State you like to get some shots in the rim but if youre Cal get the ball to Soko he can dunk the ball with authority and bring this team back within three n Music I dont really hear myself but I dont have to I hear Roxy I hear you how about now um not much I mean thats a little better maybe is that little bit just a little I dont want to overshadow the star he gets mad about that thats good that just gives me a little bit of you know makes me feel a little bit taller okay okay yeah no thats good thank you good adjustment oh were on right now right well yeah were going to be shoot I got to get ready here its Bens first rodeo clearly I mean can you get me in this shot next to Roxy at all its in my contract actually thank you what you got RX I didnt listen what you got we a shot of San Francisco were going to talk about EJ Neil yeah Music Beautiful Sunday here in the Bay Area and a terrific start for Sacramento State the Hornets out in front of Cal by a score of 107 with Ben Braun and our ACC Network crew Roxy Bernstein with you and saw a shot of San Francisco EJ Neil part of this good start for the Hornets hes a local kid who has a lot of friends and family here today and as youre well aware when kids come back to the Bay Area and play against Cal sometimes they get a little excited about this opportunity they do and you know uh you get back in this area Roxy theres nothing better than coming back home and obviously played at CC uh you know San Francisco with for Justin laau my one of my former players and I mean what a story program there so its special Roxy I dont care how many times in where you travel home is home so you you got a little bit of an edge going for you ail scooter at the line after the foul and it rolls in for scooter now two for three from the stripe and a fourpoint lead for the Hornets and these are some of the family members for EJ Neil that are here today at hos Pavilion its a family affair Roxy thats thats pretty good showing uh just great to have family I know I know when we had players we try to travel always to try to get them closer to their home so their families could see them so I I think its great and this is a short ride obviously but important scoa with seven of the Hornets 12 and they lead Cal by five here in this Cal classic matchup well see Jeremiah Wilkinson in the game lets see if he can impact the game the way he did the last game and a foul before it was stripped and its against the Hornets and the reaching is on the aforementioned EJ Neil thats two fouls on Neil yeah thats quick and you have to worry about that Roxy one thing I was going to mention that sometimes you can be a little over aggressiveness aggressive in your you know being over over hyped and so you got to really watch yourself in that regard but I I like this Sacramento State team defensive uh pressure and their their quick hands theyre really around the ball Cal again without the three key players today that three is way off from the Freshman Jeremiah Wilkinson Monty Soko on the offensive board for the Bears Here Comes Reed as petritis driving in and the rebound cleared by Jacob Holton Here Comes sack State laan Brewer Applause and leaning in just too strong from Jacob hold is petrius tried to draw a charge and from the backside petrius the steel took it away from Julian Von and the love to Jeremiah Wilkinson Roxy how about Rus petritis and what hes meant to this team he makes steals like that in the game comes up with the basketball and gives it up for the dunk thats a momentum changer on the dve trying to finish and Emil scoa who has been aggressive for Sacramento state will head back to the free throw line rush to steal I mean you cant go to sleep on Rus pus he has a nose for the ball and he has a nose for the rim setting up his teammate for a big time slam uh you know you you can chart Reus petrius and all year long hes given Cal that this type of performance first foul on Joshua Ola Joseph Amil scoa is already three for four at the line and now three for five coming in through the first four games this year he shot a total of five free throws no it hasnt been very good uh from there as well I think we only hitting once so uh you know again give give me a guy that gets the line well figure it out later but you you cant shy away from contact take it up strong get in your Rhythm get the other team in the bonus get yourself in the bonus if you can scooter missed both and the rebound control by Mahoney yeah those shots freshman who transferred from Washington State yeah those shots were off left or right thats a no no when you shoot free throws you can be short or long cant be wide uh left or right Jeremiah Wilkinson turns the corner and Banks it in and a strong finish going inside Roxy there was contact on the ball he went through the what I thought was a block kept the ball alive and still scored it hes he hasnt slowed down from the other night I can tell you that knocked Away by Reus petrides the Cal again without Javon blackshire Jr DJ Campbell and BJ omat today well I spoke with the Cal assistance before the game and they said that what Wilkinson did and does is not surprising to them and they think he can get a lot better as a Music freshman fou line jumper way off from chudy diama the red shirt freshman from London England yep and it goes out of bounds to Cal yeah it was a hesitation he was so wide open I think it fooled him and then he measured it and and he AED it you got to shoot it the first time chance for Cal to reclaim the lead sa State led by as many as five already in this one and a foul off the ball its a push on the Hornets and theyre getting it on Bailey nun the sophomore from Australia well Sacramento State small Roxy Cals got a decided height Advantage again uh you can expect the ball to get somewhere into the paint theres just a mismatch at every possession sax State probably electing to play in the zone and staying in if they can and here they are theyre getting out on the floor their two three zone They elect not to match up with Cal manto man five on the shot clock Andre St yakovich has his shot blocked but a foul Deontay Williams got him on the arm three shots for so Yakov its fouled in the act of shooting to three oh and that drives you crazy as a coach because theres look at that the shot clocks winding down that was going to be a degree of difficulty hoist and instead you put stovic whos a very good free throw shooter to the line so far 87 from the line for St yakovich he had a cur High 21 against Air Force on Thursday night playing 35 minutes also grabbed six rebounds but hes been aggressive at getting to the line hes iss averaging about six free throws attempted per game well the best thing hes done this year Roxy is hes driven the basketball he can finish with either hand he can pull up shoot over you at 67 he has quite an advantage because theres really not many guys he cant go over the top of or play through you because hes not afraid of contact and the hatrick for St yakovich he goes three for three at the stripe and Cal on a seven nothing run they have a twopoint lead mentioned the injury for Cal that theyre dealing with the injuries I should say with the three guys still out sack state had a weird injury pregame here on the drive and Lee dor sends it into the front row denying laan Brewer how about Lee Dort Roxy I mean what a luxury you get the big fella inside he says not today not my house and that swatted up into the stands but its hard to go over Cals big guys and Lead d especially hes a hes a hes a force inside but Sacramento State Alex kachev a sophomore from per Australia was supposed to start for the Hornets he got injured in warmups after the lineups were already put into the book as a foul down low on Sacramento State thats On LAN Brewer of the Hornets Ro so the injury happened and saak state because of the injury had to make a change in the starting lineup and they inserted Julian bonds with the injury to kovachev no that just doesnt happen I think it might have happened once during my coaching career Spencer Mahoney missing a three the offensive rebound Le Dort trying to reverse and Shi away from contact it was a freak injury and an offensive foul a push Bailey nun trying to create space but turn over on the Hornets well there was some contact there obviously the officials felt that none initiated the contact its and if you initiate it thats on you and you gain an advantage thats why it was called right there was certainly contact it looked maybe like it was the other way but the officials a little closer than us thought that the contact was initiated by the guard Andre St yakovich who played his high school ball up in the Sacramento area Jesuit High School and from carmichel one of the suburbs there of carmeno of course the son of p yakovich as Reus petritis another steal and hes up to the races and the slam for petrius timeout saak stage theres a timeout Reus petrius doing what Reus petritis does hes a pest hes a nuisance unless hes on your team I mean look at that theres there is a steal from behind you dont see it coming and watch Roxy he just gets there and finds a way but Rus Petrus giving his team an edge the Cal Bears are up they lead by four conratulations he just does the same thing every game hes just you hate playing against him that last steal I dont know if we have a chance to replay it but I love the last deal maybe more than the other one here it is yes sir youre on it yeah yeah yeah I had no problems hearing you was bad not me no I can hear you no it was me I couldnt hear no I hear you I couldnt hear me but nobody cares about that Im Im okay Im fine Im Im good whats that okay I tried yeah okay so no Stanford and no Justin right now that could change other Stanford yeah oh youre going to put Jaylen in his shot his winning shot okay let me handle let me handle that I I I talked to the coaches I wanted to talk about that yeah I you dont mind should I take it Rox yeah its fine youre scrolling whats that Ill take it for me Applause I have two tickets for the student section at the table if Eliza and Julius want to come down and they should there are some people from Berkeley High here for the student section at the table period Julius and Eliza can sit there period there are students from brookley high right well Roxy how about the Stanford Cardinal down Jaylen Blakes a chance to ice it here and take the lead Big Time shot I mean huge shot by Jaylen Blakes and Stanford with the big comeback win over Santa clir on the road thats a thats a huge win and I got to tell you Jaylen Blakes had just pre previously missed a free throw Roxy what does he do he comes back and he makes the game winner Big Time shot he provides a different element for Kyle Smith in Stanford with his toughness his leadership but another huge game Maxim Reno six double doubles in their six and0 start you look at RJ Davis as the Tarheels before they play the Maui Invitational which starts tomorrow played at the University of Hawaii and they wi it going away from the Rainbow Warriors in Honolulu so theyre getting their feet wet over in the islands before playing in Maui well and I dont know if any three players are having the kind of season so far that they are they these guys are dominating its going to be interesting to see what they do on a national stage Christian Tucker back in the game for Cal playing with two fouls and Cal sitting in the zone Julian Vons who is not shy Nails a three yeah unit his Zone Roxy I think thats not a bad call for Mark Manson but now you still got to get out to the threepoint line and challenge up not out so many times you challenge out and players dont pay that any regard ends at nine nothing run for Cal lead Dort out of the double team good find arus petritis gets it back to Dort with the left hand Lee dorts first points of the day and I love his ability to use his off hand Roxy hes big he gets two feet in the paint and he delivers if he gets the ball down low its bottoms Jacob H who already has a three today Now cal back of the man B in and out and the rebound Spencer Mahoney for Cal youll see Sacramento State shooting that shot at will if Cal gives it to him you see the Baseline double from the Baseline side thats very odd most people double from the middle Christian Tucker on the drive and finish great Drive Great finish by Christian Tucker with the off hand he can do that Roxy he did it all of last year for his former school and when he gets his confidence look out hes a real asset for the Cal Bears largest lead and now Tucker its not on Tucker its off the ball the foul and its on Reus petritis now I take it back its on Dort first on Dort you know I think K wants to maintain their aggressiveness Roxy when theyre aggressive and certainly when Reus tritis is in the game you are aggressive You by uh you know by association hes on the floor your team just picks up its aggressiveness automatic Cs been a two three team underneath now theyre going back to the man dont want to give up anything up the inbound a wide open look on a three for EJ Neil who was the beneficiary of a good screen well the good screen you got to stay on their hip but sometimes the screen will erase that option its not as easy as we say to stay on somebodys hip because theres some guys screening and theyre getting multiple screens at that third three for sack State they make almost 11 per game Jeremiah Wilkinson trying to lead it for Lee Dort and some miscommunication results in a turnover yeah they wanted to post up in the paint but you know if you look inside again you can see heres that that screen its its over the top and you got to stay a little closer but saak state does a good job of running their stuff and getting threepoint shots yeah Dort doing a better job covering out this time on the three Emil scoa to strong on the three Lee Dort clears it for Cal and Dort who leads K rebounding this year right around seven and a half a game Christian Tucker has some space theres Dort again on the glass for the Bears C just one for eight so far from three J mayah Wilkinson the floater and hes fouled and its the first on Jacob Holtz well thats twice now that sack state has fouled Roxy at the end of a shot clock I know coaches cant be happy about that but you know you just got to make that guard go over the top of you because youre already 611 and Wilkinsons got to struggle to get over the top you but but you cant foul its absolutely late clock cannot foul and so now Cal gets rewarded 17 fouls so Cal is in the bonus for the rest of the half and two shots for Jeremiah Wilkinson who is now eight for 11 from the foul line on the young season Cals done a great job this year Roxy at getting in getting teams in foul trouble players in foul trouble getting into the bonus it seems like every game theyre making a parade to the free throw line thats going to pay off in big games or as it has this year when theyve been down theyve actually gotten back in the game by getting to the foul line and theyre making 19 free throws a game and a good look rims out for Jacob Holtz and looks to push it thats a big number Roxy thats one of the best in the ACC I can tell you that Jeremiah Wilkinson hangs Joshua Ola Joseph Corner three now thats good basketball Roxy penetration which you have to get a stop lson so strong to the basket but how about Joseph just with the spot up dead Corner thats what youre taught to do largest lead for Cal the second made three for the Bears and Emil scoa throws up a wild shot crashing the the lane Christian Tucker leads the break Ola Joseph lines it up three and hes fouled a chance for four Joshua Ola Joseph knocks it down oh my Cal making some noise Roxy Tucker getting the ball to his teammate who just hit a shot and Wilkinson making these drives to the basket finding ol Joseph in the corner count that and then obviously you know youve got Ola Joseph says you know what going to get it done from this from the top and one why not try to get a threepoint play oh The Undefeated C women return to hospital thur December 5th they take Alabama Crimson the ACC chall yes sir yes sir yes sir I can hear you oh yeah I just did I did you know oh I thought somebody down here was telling you yes sir Roxy told me I didnt have to he said screw Jas no Im just whats that all good stuff man good replays I dont you know I dont have to say replay anymore Ive been criticized for not saying it enough now I dont say it at all I dont I you know look at that paint points love it Cals got some talent I think personally Music largest lead for Cal the have scored seven straight up on Sacramento State and Cs made five their last six shots but one of the encouraging signs and numbers so far from this one for me Ben call struggled on assist so far this year and sharing the ball a lot of the points been coming in oneonone and he has attacking and go get to the basket but Cal is among the worst teams in the country in terms of assists as a team they average less than 10 per game 96 Cal ranks 34 third in the country out of 355 teams and assists but already with five assists on nine buckets and patrus has three of those Roxy I agree last year I think they struggled in that department a lot of oneonone play and when you got first rounders you you tend to let them go oneonone but this is a team this year Roxy a lot different because theyve got depth theyve got guys that can spot up in the corners knock down threes theyve got guys that can penetrate and Dish I think youre going to see that sky that that assist uh total really Skyrocket as the year goes up uh because they theyve got some guys that can penetrate pitch Joshua Ola Joseph missing the chance for four and it stays a ninepoint lead for California here with 740 left in the half I like Cals length Roxy theyre just big long I mean they theyve got size at every possession and a fresh shot clock for sack state after the offensive rebound Jacob Holtz Emil scooter left open and off on the three Joshua Ola Joseph clears and Cal looks to push it back to the zone for sack State tough shot from the corner Ola Joseph missing the three and the rebound grabbed by EJ Neil for Sacramento State well good ball movement Rox thats a missed shot but KS really rotating the basketball well my opinion theres a reach in against Cal there goes that man first on petritis you better get some insurance actually theft Insurance or something I I mean if you dont see him coming he hes gone hell pick your pocket and you wont know its been picked I mean look at this hes just he said look youre exposing the ball that really Roxy thats a pretty pretty good play I officials could have let that one go but fortius is a best six foul on Cal so the next one puts saak State into the bonus and now theyll go to the line and Jeremiah Wilkinson in disbelief that hes guilty of a foul a one and one for the Hornets well Kales playing aggressively you got to you you know you got to like that early in the Years you tend to move your hands and your arms and not your feet but if you know with Cal size theyre athleticism their length uh they move their feet theyre going to make it very difficult for teams to score this year saak St has not been a good foul shooting team this year gets the Roll But A team that makes fewer than eight free throws a game well if you know yeah they shooting 59 on the on the year thats not a great percentage uh most college teams are in the upper 60s 7s so thats pretty low percentage that theyve got to improve that sevenpoint lead for Cal Rus petrius drives the lane and the finger roll hes at that in between pos position Roxy is he a guard is he a forward I dont know what he is but hes a player hes a tough match up thats for sure hes just I mean you know you he can knock down the three so you have to honor that but if you make a mistake and gamble against Tim Roxy he is gone but guess what he leaves her team and assist right now this game so you better get a guy there and then be able to cover back out but hes done it on both ends of the floor second foul on Jeremiah Wilkinson and its Bailey dun or biley nun back to the line for the Hornets you know I think on every team Roxy theres that one player you kind of say we just cant leave him on the bench and off the floor because he gives us too much on both ends and I think Rus petritis is one of those players uh when you know in his first or second game of the season he was playing so well Mark Manson left him out there and gave him a big run big rotation minutes uh and thats going to happen year I think as year goes on and when were talking to the Air Force guys here on Thursday as there is a strong take by Rus petritis and they were bummed they were upset that they lost him because he was such a productive player for the Air Force you can see why Roxy I mean he just scored on the other end I mean nothing he doesnt do for his team and a nice scoop cutting across the lane by Deontay Williams and the other thing you can add to Rus Petrus his game Roxy is that hes unselfish he could put up bigger numbers he doesnt hes a team guy he makes plays for his for his teammates and a block and Bailey none in disbelief thats his third foul well you know heres what were talking about you know he can make the move and uh gets to the basket its just not a problem for him hes strong hes long and when he makes his move Roxy I mean you got to put a second Defender there hes rangy 67 strong uh and hes likes being to the line but he gets there and hes not afraid of contact one and one for petritis ninth team foul in the Hornets and its in and out for petritis missing the front end of the one and one inside five and a half to go first half yeah first appearance for Bowen Bey the sevenfooter from Australia for Sacramento State and a wild reverse layup attempt for Deontay Williams that wasnt close no Mar s said look youre going to have to go through me or over the top uh that wasnt happening Andre to yakovich from behind the line well Roxy when he gets his threepoint shot going like that and he shoots it like that with confidence hes Unstoppable I mean he hes had games this year hes been their leading score but hes done it from within uh the interior now hes starting to make his threepoint shots largest lead Julian Vs missing the pullup and its out of bounds to California now heres the swing and you know watch if you can you know the the release I think stokovich just feels confident now he puts a lot of time in dont have to talk about his dad weve already done that enough but its not like he doesnt have pedigree his dad just an unbelievable NBA Hall of Famer that could shoot it and thats an offensive foul and mty Soko whos in disbelief on the call well he said he you know he he thinks there he wants him to go to the monitor to check that cant be reversed that was the call the only thing that can be reviewed here is if theres an upgrade from the common foul on Soko theres nothing good that can come out of this for the Golden Bears but for me Ben I think thats I think sokos got an argument because thats a cylinder violation to me m sasoko is entitled to the space that he is in and Julian bonds went crashing into him and to your point Rox see two things happen on that play number one he got pushed he got shoved into uh you know his his Defender second of all the player that came off of that made contact really hard and possibly in as you say the head area so uh you know maybe Soko has a law law future because hes pleading his case and he may have one theres the push youre right B and be no theres a push pushed him in the back yeah I think the officials will get this r and uh sometimes you got to argue and you got to well itll be itll stand as a common foul thats my guess because it will not get upgraded again this call cannot be changed no but you but you can find out again if theres going to be some and well get the officials uh the only thing that can change is they can upgrade it from a common to a flagrant one if they choose thats the only thing thats reviewable here well and the fact that the officials are going back to go back again and look at it and then discuss it I think that theres more to it then meets the eye but you know gives Soko credit he he said it I thought in a very respectful way he said he baded to the officials uh theres the push uh and yes the the the the push caused the contact to the head that was not uh ma Soko you know making contact to the Head his own player pushed him into his own own player head and so I think theyre going to play on after the foul second foul in Marty Doo good defense by Cal Roxy theyre really out on the floor pressuring the passing Lanes pass knocked away stolen by Lee Dort for the Bears Andre sakovich in transition left it short got his own Miss laid it in but is upset with himself the first time but you know what I love players that stick with their shot you know as a shooter where your shots going even if its getting blocked go up and put it back largest lead for Callis yakovich leads the Golden Bears with eight and now were going back the other way after an offensive foul on lockin Brewer Cal starting to take control here late in the first half Music Music that was a strange play I mean hes clearly pushed him yeah so you cant reverse the call you cant change the call you up they just missed it they missed it that what happened but and the contact of the head was because of the push yeah is officials yeah Jerry Jerry assist wheat hey Im trying to get my kids yeah who knows youre asking me the wrong guy I never know hey my my my son got his license two days ago I took his car away the next day okay okay okay ask me what I like about these Cal Bears I have an answer if not now later but I I I have a thought I think its a good thought and Ill say thanks for asking r yeah as I I was well another big win for charman Smith and the cow Womens Basketball team for the second straight year California is now 6 and0 and a really good win against an Auburn team that comes out of the SEC and Cal hung on making eight threes in the win against Auber thats a great start and you know what those are big wins Roxy uh you know thats really a good sign for Cal Womens Basketball uh coach Smith doing a good job but look at the trio I mean look what they have been able to do that that group is really getting it done next up theyll be down in Palm Springs for a day with Michigan State on Tuesday but what a terrific win and a great start again for Charan Smith and the Cal women theys six and0 and this Edition Mark matsons team trying to get to 5 and one with a win today and enjoying their largest lead of this ball game so far against Sacramento State still plenty of time on the shot clock for Christian Tucker five on the timer to yakovich has it knocked away driving the Baseline and the Hornets Come Away With It good defense by The Hornet Julian V and Jacob Holt launching a three thats short Joshua Ola Joseph with an active first half grabs the rebound thats great defensive patience discipline stay on the floor making it very difficult for sax state to get a good look to the basket read is Petri backs his way into the key and off balance and the Hornets Come Away With It hes trying to draw a foul nothing nothing there EJ Neil the kick out Jacob Holtz three second three for the sack State big man who was six for 12 on his threes this season coming into today Santa Clara transfer can shoot Roxy hes thats what they want to do they want to get Cals bigs out on the floor and if they dont get out there knockdown shots Christian Tucker down the lane read is petritis missing from the corner and its last Touch by Sacramento State and its going to stay at this end with Cal and Michael zeppel the head coach of the Hornets in disbelief yeah it looked like that was that was a little different from our point of view but off the inbound left open in the corner and a good look for Andre St yakovich would not go down and the rebound controlled by the Hornets Amil scoa nice drop off and a foul Andre St yakovich will send Jacob Holt to the line the First on St yakovich well that was a great drop off Roxy thats thats thats how you get it done I mean you make a drive you draw the big and you deliver to your big I mean you know if you can get that done if you can get your bigs to help up we call that helping up that really puts some problems on your defense because theres just nobody on the drop off one more for Holtz played two years for herb sendek down at Santa CLA this highly recruited player out of Delta British Columbia one of the top 25 recruits throughout Canada when he chose to go to Santa Clara two years there last year average about seven points per game for sack State well and he can knock down threes hes a 50 threepoint shooter so thats what sack States trying to do is trying to get Cal out and knock down those shots if they dont come out 90 seconds left in the half Christian Tucker penetrates Andre St yakovich attacks and a foul will get him to the line and its On LAN Brewer of saak day well how about that pass Roxy from Christian Tucker his body was just prone I mean he was just I mean my goodness he goes down the lane he gets knocked he still delivers the pass the reverse and the ball into stovich is hands and he knows what to do hes so good at knifing we call it knifing on the catch hes already moving with the Flight of the ball hes not waiting to catch it and then beat you off the dribble hes meeting the pass he knows that hes going to be closed out on and so hes going to drive it one more shot for sakovich leads Cal with eights Emil scooter Jacob Holt seven e to lead Sacramento State and sakovich goes one for two at the line sax States got to get some points in the board they dont want to let this lead get bigger than the double digits it is right now maybe get it under 10 Holt too strong on the three and the rebound offensive board ail scoa and the kick out three missed by EJ Neil and there is Lee Dort on the glass for Cal two good looks for sack state that would have got it under under 10 Roxy those would have been huge baskets Now cal will take its time and see if they can get a little clock but get a good look and maybe get back to the line or get a wide open shot Cal holding Sacramento State to 32 shooting and a pass forced by Wilkinson in a turnover here come the Hornets on the attack Trail three Julian vs for Sacramento State well theres the trade they wanted Roxy that does get them under the 10 minute to 10point lead and now theyve closed this thing to six points a double digit sorry a two possession game K now playing that they hope for would be the last shot maybe give a take a couple of seconds but theyre not going to theyre not going to give sax tap much time coming back to the way they knock it away from sakovich there goes Jacob Hol gliding in re petrius pushes Joshua Ola Joseph fouled on a three and a bad mistake by Sacramento State the foul on EJ Neil his third you know Roxy weve said this already but that is not the first not the second thats the third time that sack state has committed that foul look at the steals here though You got quick hands big fella poing poking it away going down Holt on the other end the sure dunk I mean theyve closed this thing which should have been a fourpoint game until the letup here on this end of the floor I mean you just again if they hit a three Roxy they hit a three but your body momentum H you wasnt as bad as I thought but uh you know I think maybe Ola Joseph sold a little bit of that too but you know the bottom line is if theres a shooter going up you cant you got to make sure he can come down thats the rule and you dont want to be anywhere near dont give the officials a reason to make a call just play it safe three for three for Ola Joseph who now has nine from Beyond mid court and its just short from Julian bonds and Cal with a sevenpoint lead at the half over the sack State Hornets who battled back EJ Neil the drop off and the laye by Jacob Hol and its a fivepoint game well Holts been a problem for Cal Roxy whether its been inside or outside theyre losing track of him penetration his mans helping which is good defense but when you help up youre susceptible to getting beat on the drop off Hol now with 11 coming off a k High 20 and their loss last Saturday at home to seon Mi sasoko and waiting for the signal and its an offensive foul on sasoko and his second offensive foul thats three fouls on mty Soko that I mean you know thats tough uh you know you you you know you want to say did the defense get there certainly he was he was there outside the arc I think he was there I think the fish has made a pretty good call well even the the cylinder doesnt really come into play because he was passing the ball so that really gets taken out of the equation oh hes trying to pass the ball Jacob hold again and the Hornets are within three timeout Mark mat and he did not like to start to the second half no and thats what coaches do great timeout but they got a they got a problem Rock theyve got to solve it K playing against a very aggressive Sacramento State team theyre scoring hold on the inside and the outside Sacramento state has narrowed and cut this lead 2 three I dont think K took sack State very seriously whats that I the coaches were telling me that they were worried about their team not taking this team seriously yeah cuz they read the paper they read own you know it was a 10 win team last year that lost their top four scores you know so this one over here is my friends daughter which one the blonde over here oh okay and they shes twin s twin sister they both go here really yeah what was the verdict for uh you know whats the verdict coming up for schools now your kids still havent heard from tan yeah all right yes sir yes sir I know that well my son just got back from there Youth and government baby take me up Rox I want to talk about yeah yeah sure good luck yeah yeah you march on it you march on the capital now good shot man I love it giv sack State some love got a lot of trees in Sacramento tell you that thats right and they got harlos yeah I know they got harlos did it really dont do that Julius Julius Julius get him Music Music Music well sack state has closed it to three behind Jacob Holt who leads all scorers in the game with 13 of course the campus of Sacramento State not too far from the capital no this the uh the great famous capital and I have to say it Roxy my son just got back from his youth in government there so hes working it tough but how about Jacob Hol I mean my goodness hes given his team a lift inside outside the transfer knocking down shots hes been huge Roxy and hes helped his team narrow this lead to three great start to the second half for the Hornets who Trail by as many as 12 in the first half and Mark Madson calling a timeout to get his teams attention and get them refocused because you have a tight ball game now and a foul as Andre St yakovich cuts into the key well and thats what Mark Madson said look were on offense lets at least now get get an easy one lets not settle lets get to the basket and stovich has been so aggressive for his team when hes aggressive hes another level player Roxy and he he took the ball strong group out second foul on Amil scoa and nearly a steal for Julian Vons off the inbound read is petritis the floater what a weapon he is Roxy I mean theyre in a Zone a little bit of a short clock he just goes up avoids the offensive foul floats it for two and gives Cal a little bit of a cushion now they got to get a stop defensively to try to complete the deal the lob for Holtz tries to power his way through it just wouldnt go for Jacob H challenged by Lee Dort now thats a big challenge because you have to go over the top of Dort you have to do something special hes big hes strong and hes agile Andre to yakovich finds an open read is petritis and the rebound grabbed by EJ Neil for Sacramento State Emil scoa the native of Helsinki Finland trying the reverse and its last Touch by Sacramento State well he was hoping for a foul he thought there was some contact in there but Roxy youre going in to the Land of the Giants you going over the top of Lee Dort thats something hard to do because hes he really is strong hes hes not going to give up his position good lower base hes pretty good at going vertical a lot of big guys like to reach I think their coaching staffs done a good job job with him Christian Tucker and he gets tied up and the arrow belongs to Cal well give sack State Credit Roxy they are swarming the basketball wherever wherever theyre going thats what hornets do I mean yeah theyve done that he Hornets too I like it roxs I like it well theyre making a buzz with that read petritis and a foul and two shots coming up for the transfer from the Air Force Academy fourth on EJ Neil with 1735 to go yeah the foul before the block shot I think cuz that was a clean block Roxy that was a foul with the body again when when Cals been in a little bit of trouble not just in this game but out this season this this young season they have managed to stop runs by getting right here to this foul line and thats a lost art today I thought so many teams try to shoot their their way back in uh thats great if your shot Falls if not you better find something else need to get your free throws to fall too one out of two for petritis exactly and Cal under 70 for the game and a three by Jacob Holt who has 16 and for Jacob Holt thats his third three and he hes feeling it Roxy hes talking to his teammates the fans anybody thatll listen hes confident and again sack state within three Christian Tucker missed a three and Julian bonds the in side position with the rebound and a tie game on a three from Julian bonds his third three for the Hornets I dont think Mark Mansons going to call a Time out that would be burning one here but hes got to get his team to settle down defend and come down here on this end of the floor and get get an easy one they need a sure basket now stop this run where is Cal going to get the offense from stovic has been a guy thats been giving it to him all year long spins foul and one Andre sto yakovich call me Nostradamus pretty good pretty easy to make that pretty easy to make that prediction Rox Roxy thats the guy that theyve on to and good to see him be aggressive you see he spins gets the rim theres no chance you you got size in stovich at s67 theyre just thats just a tough matchup for a smaller guard and Mark Manson and his staff have given has theyve given the sophomore really a lot of leeway to be aggressive sometimes I dont think hes aggressive enough but he missed the n one free throw twopoint lead inside 16 and2 to play well Cal didnt know they were going to be in for a game they no now and the strip in the steel Lee Dort took it away for Cal Jeremiah Wilkinson and the long rebound Emil scooter 199 run for sack State dating back to about four minutes left in the first half and you can see the confidence growing in the belief in sack State as they theyre right in this game with Cal foul and one Julian bonds and a chance to give Sacramento State the lead you talked about confidence Roxy and theyre feeling it they they must have heard you they must have heard you you got to have confidence in this game theres a little bit of Swag going both ways but its Sacramento thats climbed back in this game to even it were 50 were 45 all we asked for a good game we got it better than cin like shouldnt be no I oh this is good man this is we got a good game I like it J number 10 how about higher or lower Applause what you got roxs trouble yes sir we just go with that lets do it its good stuff I think you got to talk about sack this has been about them this half this theyve had a hell of a half here I mean look at this I like dorge defense though yeah how do they yeah you want me to take it you you going Ill take it from here yeah hold has been huge Music Music Roxy how is sack State climbed back into this game you can see theyve got some guys going to work right here theyre attacking Cal with good off ball movement big fella H going to the basket I mean doing a great job I mean then theyre knocking down outside shots you know you cant be cant go to sleep but if youre playing really loose up top theyve got guys that can just flat out shoot it with confidence and and thats what theyre doing so uh you know right now Cals got to get out there and get out to some Shooters and Mark mson is talking about this at at in the Huddle uh theyve got their their hands full uh its not that they cant score on sack State although sack States defense has gotten better but its really the challenge has been right here on on this other end of the floor theyve got to do a good job of stopping the Hornets Julian vs at the line for the Hornets and a chance to give sack State their first lead since early in this game and they have rallied from 12 down to take a onepoint lead well psychologically I know the games not won and loss psychologically but it starts there sometimes and now they feel that they can play and theyre in this game and theyve gotten the lead thats huge and Cals gotten a little bit out of sorts at this end of the floor well when they needed a basket they put the ball in zovic is hand and and and thats what theyre going to need to do again and re is petrius grabbing the loose ball and the foul on Deontay Williams of sack day well you see that nothings coming easy for Cal and thats a credit to Sacramento State theyre active they poked the ball away I I mean theyve made it difficult but again you know who do you go to if youre Cal Wilkinson came off as huge game a game ago was a freshman but you got to think that the veterans that have played like uh you know the big fella down low and Dort you got to put the ball down low and see if get some easy WIS theres another turnover ill advised pass off the inbound by Reedus petrius and look saak State you mentioned them defensively this has been a good defensive team through their first four games they played their one win was against the Cal Maritime Academy its Lee Dort shoves Jacob Holt to the ground second foul on Dort and they blew them out now its certainly a step up and play from Cal Mari time to Cal it is you see San Diego who they played and also Fresno State so they played some decent teams so far well they theyre really now putting it together I mean you can see them when theyre clicking that they are a difficult team to guard their system is is a difficult system the Inside Out balance of being able to play with a seven footer that stretches you all the way out to the top of the key that gives up driving Lanes you have to to get out there and guard that their defensive numbers so far this year allowing fewer than 63 points per game holding the opposition to 35 shooting and 25 from three no I think its a really those are good stats theres no question but Zack States also average 17 assists a game they can distribute uh have turned it over a little more than coaches would like but uh Cals got to get on the board here RX Jeremiah Wilkinson before the shot and a foul on the D drive against Sacramento State well I like the philosophy it doesnt always look pretty Roxy but if youre Cal and youre getting pressured you cant sit on the on the perimeter and play East West that Pete new who this court was named after said that multiple times in my career with Pete you you you want to go north south east west looks good but it doesnt get you to the p p left open Reus petritis huge three for Cal now theres the man whos been giving Cal a lift every ounce of the way huge three by petrius Deep Corner Cal sees saws in front 12 for petritis now and the Bears take it away great defense by the Bears petritis thought about it now Jeremiah Wilkinson a launch backto back threes for Cal talked about unselfish Play Roxy theres Pro tiers who just hit a three saying you know what I can probably take another one let me get to a guy thats even more open than me count it and Cal assisting on both those last two field goals as Julian bonds answers along two for the Hornets well I dont think the Hornets are thinking about going away so Cals got to continue their unselfish play and their aggressiveness Jeremiah Wilkinson and the rebound grabb by Deontay Williams here come the Hornets Jacob Hol spins and the jump hook and Lee Dort challenged and then grabbed the rebound for Cal yeah H hurried himself all because of Lee Dort Roxy he was Point Blank at the basket had some good fakes but was in a hurry to get it over the top of the big fella and a foul as Jeremiah Wilkinson moving in again Roxy doesnt look pretty but youve got guys on Cal in Wilkinson petritis and stovich that are really really difficult to defend oneonone and theyre just putting their bodies into the paint hurling themselves to the basket drawing fouls sixth team foul on sack State third personal on Deontay Williams splitting a double team and loose ball picked up by Jeremiah wil Wilson hangs and one and a strong finish from The Freshman Jeremiah Wilkinson Roxy Im not so sure how youd stop Wilkinson when he gets ahead of speed I mean he gets downhill and watch what he does he hangs in the air good vertical good good hang time and hes able to draw contact and play through contact a lot of players cant do that Wilkinson can fourth on Bailey nun in and out on the free throw and then patr slips inside for the offensive rebound and draws the foul Roxy I dont care who Cals opponent is if you dont have number 31 on your scouting for that hes a pest you better block him out keep a body just watch him make something out of nothing that should have been a secured rebound go the other way and petrius keeps it alive and draws the foul third un lockin Brewer but another missed free throw from Cal as petritis is now one for four from the line yeah an uncharacteristic Roxy because he has traditionally been a good free throw shooter uh on the year shooting 83 so so maybe its the extra minute sometimes fatigue sets in thats thats a that happens early in the year they change the foul by the way its on B and Bey not Lan Brewer and other thing Roxy some of the car cow players are used to playing a little more minutes I mean arent used to playing the minutes theyre playing now so maybe fatigue does sometimes play a factor Lan Brewers the block from Reus petritis in transition Jeremiah Wilkinson and a foul as Wilkinson got hit in the face and hell go to the line for a one and one you know he just makes something out of nothing Roxy he gets by his Defender and quickly as Zack state has done they get a second Defender but I mean you you guard the you get in here but watch the block by pus I mean he goes up there creates space separation doesnt foul doesnt get his body involved and just uses his 67 frame to put back what looked like a sure layup Wilkinson one for two from the line today 10 points off the bench and he hits the front end Roxy I Im going to go out and say this I think that these games are going to benefit Cal as the year goes on youre getting guys who are getting minutes theyre getting a chance to play now and theyre theyre counting on these guys to play and these extra minutes now at this point in the season I think will really help the Cals depth even further Callas push the lead back out to seven which matches their largest lead of the second half they led by as many as 12 in the first half Emil scooter long on the three and the offensive rebound Deontay Williams and a reach in on Christian Tucker of Cal well thats where if youre Cal youre a little concerned because Cal is bigger than you are and theyve got guys that can rebound they you just you know you dont want to give up Second Chance opportunities especially to a team thats knocking on the door and hanging around to do some damage teaml number four on the Bears and the inbound Deontay Williams penetrates the kick Corner three in and out for biley nun and C with the rebound nun had a good look though oh great look thats a that was in and out sooko is working so hard on the Block Roxy they they might have missed him a few times Wilkinson nice pass Joshua Ola Joseph to Mi Soko oh theres that unselfishness Roxy we just talked about Ola Joseph gets to the rim and just hangs and just delivers a a shot pull up three Julian bonds a careerhigh tying 17 I think we must think were watching the game at the Kings home home court right here this games going back and forth like an NBA game Roxy its a great basketball game offensive foul thats four on Christian Tucker look at Moko Roxy if theres any doubt about the strength agility and explosiveness theres not any more of this fell can play Cal with the lead by Music six theyre going to have to put Wilkinson at the point hes more of an offg guard so thats going to be interesting theyre going so lets talk about that I think because he now hes not going to probably score as much but can he distribute yes sir whats his name oh I know him I love this man hes hes a hes a Human Highlight I mean he just everything he touched turns to Gold Golden Bears I love this guy look at this highway robbery give me that give me that all right Im going to have fun with this Applause one oh I love this guy yeah ah this is so good here dang good Music highlights nothing like a few replays Music they looking to see if it should they think it should be a flagrant one and oh I dont think so do you un Tucker you think so I didnt see it Lieutenant Jason on the Caper youre going to youre going to scope it out see if there was any any harm theyre talking about it must be something there yeah yeah no I know I didnt if Tucker caught him with an elbow yeah I didnt see Music Applause okay sixpoint lead for California 1135 to go at hos Pavilion with Ben Brun at her 8 ACC Network Pro Roxy bernon with you and Reus petritis has come up big again today for Cal yeah watch the uh watch the Golden Hand I mean he makes steal he made several today but watch his ability also to get by his Defender absorb some contact knock it down but here he is that pest you dont see him coming hes like hudini now you see it now you dont and if you think he hasnt done enough offensively how about defensively give me that send that back I mean hes just had one of a game so far for the Cal Bears now were getting a little ruling here from the official but look at what petrius has done Roxy 13 points I mean hes got five assists several steals he has impacted this game every which way so during the timeout they reviewed the offensive foul on Christian Tucker and officiating crew Jerry heer James Ford and Dell Dean have upgraded the foul to a flagrant one from a common foul Christian Tucker was his fourth personal already all right officials so itll be two shots in the flagrant one for Julian vond and because of the flagrant one saak St will also get possession at the point of interruption and Vons missing the first of Two Shots well thats huge Roxy because if he can convert the these free throws and retain on The Possession score this could be a big big turnaround for sack State I mean you always worry about these as momentum changes already momentum has been going in sack States favor you dont want to give them any further reasons to gain more momentum so Vons now with a ker High 18 an interesting route to sack state for V who is from Oakland and he originally went to Chico State but didnt play as a freshman because that was the co year and they did not play that season is Deontay Williams on the drive and a travel and a turnover by sack state so then Vons left Chico State went to play for Justin laau the City College of San Francisco for a year then went north of the border to the University of Alberta and now is playing for Sacramento State well Ive seen him Play Roxy both in games and uh you you know in practices with Justin and his teams I mean hes a talented player and hes giving his team a lift Roxy theres no no substitute for experience and Veteran leadership and play Joshua Ola Joseph missing a three M Soko elevates for the rebound and a foul and the double bonus two shots for coko great job by Mar Soko Roxy of going up over the top of his his man but he did it without fouling thats just really uh skill and athleticism but he did both he avoided contact fourth on Julian Vons Vons has four EJ Neil four biley nun four fouls for Sacramento State while for Cal Christian Tucker has four one more for sasoko seven points the grad transfer from Michigan State when a season I 10 earlier this year against Bakersfield and Soko now a perfect four for four from the line well hes also going to give him something on this end Roxy he also has six blocks on the year so youre just not going to go into the basket without being challenged by big fellow Amil scoa wav it off on the drive a foul second on Reedus petritis and thats what coach wants to do Roxy thats exactly what coach zeppel wants to do he wants to get his players to be aggressive you know get to the foul line themselves dont just rely on the three but theyve got some guys that can drive Music it Amil scoa crashes the key another foul on petritis well and Amil scas found something Roxy he knows again hes catching the ball as we talked about on the Move hes not waiting for petrius get out there he knows hes getting get approached and closed out on so hes catching it and getting a piece of petritis thats twice now hes drawn fouls and Mark Manson will have to go to his bench and make some substitutions seven team foul so a one and one for Emil scoa yeah when they when youre down Roxy now you got to go to your bench even further and play a few guys that really havent played many minutes this year for Cal and short from scooter Joshua Ola Joseph the rebound so Spencer Mahoney is getting some run here and good to see he changed his shoes from the other night yeah hes got the gray shoes today is foul in the post and St yakovich will get two shots out of this one and the foul the Third on llan Brewer and Chris Spencer Mahoney ditched the red Nikes in favor of the gray with the purple I dont know if any I like those a lot better yeah the Reds Roxy as you and I know you dont go over very well k k territory you dont wear red no you just you know we learned that early especially big game week you know Roxy both teams we its not just Cal both teams missing and leaving some points on the board at the line and if this games to be close you could point to free throws as maybe being a Difference Maker one for two to yakovich who now has 12 and the Cal lead is eight drive to the basket and the Finish Deontay Williams the native of Sydney Australia well they know how to play to the rib Roxy I mean again youre taught that that you you you practice that but theyre really good at finishing the Tucker on the bench four fouls a travel on St yakovich as one more look at the driving layup by Deontay Williams yeah and heres that play Roxy youre going to catch and you obviously going to fake good fake of getting to the rim theres just no help there I mean zakovich got beat but theres nobody helping So Cal without blackshire Tucker on the bench with four fouls how does that change what Mark Madson does offens no youve got to continue to go through the guys that have given it to you all year long and and you know Stak thats a great block Roxy into the paint the lob and the Finish no it pops out but cleaned up and the first college points for Spencer money well thats one way you put points back on the board you asked the question you just saw the answer you get up and down in transition run the floor thats great numbers by Cal great finish Jeremiah Wilkinson having a run lot of point guard now with Tucker out deep three short Emil scoa and the long rebound kept Alive by sack State Second Chance opportunities rxs Bailey nun the kick Jacob Holt long on the three Joshua Ola Joseph the rebound nice challenge by Ola Joseph that you have to do that when youre playing Jacob hold you cannot allow him to shoot an uncontested three as you talked about where this Points going to come youre going to have to be aggressive theyve had success driving it the drop off and the L Wilkinson finds Andre St yakovich and the first double digit lead for Cal the second half good recipe for Success Roxy you drive it and you dish it but you know what about the defense because thats whats going to make the difference in this game how about the block party BYO I mean just good good job and then theres a put back by the taller uh Cal Bears inside but I love stovich he plays big hes not afraid to get around the basket Cal Bears extending their lead bye J was getting a little bit hairy there for a minute what do you think you got it now right yes yes sir look like yeah I like d Applause bam hes big man oh yeah we yeah yeah no I love it I love I like the big fell he makes a difference hes he and Moko give them some presents inside yeah yeah look at that nice highlights good good Music catch there it is and Wilkerson no no Jord Dort lets do it Music one more folks turn off the fles pleas Music Music Music yeah yeah I think well in case you werent aware and Im sure you were or are the phenomenal drive that maybe go down in big game lowers the drive 98 yards for the winning touchdown fando Mendoza to Jonathan Brady then Jade not the twopoint conversion and Cal with the fourth straight year wins the big game B eligible what a performance by Fernando Mendoza on that last Drive engineering a touchdown when Cal needed it and the defense made some adjustments got some stops Cal now six and five theyll be on ESPN 2 coming up Saturday against SMU the final regular season game for Cal and then you find out where theyre going to play in a bowl game but just a tremendous comeback by Cal yesterday yesterday in the 127 bck game Roxy youve been a part of this for many years but one of the better comebacks you see the deficit 217 late fourth quarter and a 98 yd drive by Mendoza I mean offensive foul illegal screen Amil scoa you cant say enough about Fernando you know Mendo and what he did Roxy he literally took took the blame I mean he put the game on his shoulders for the loss the week before not sure it was all on his shoulders but Ill tell you this you love a young man that takes up leadership crying on national TV emotional but he took his team and just made some unbelievable plays to salt that game away late Jeremiah Wilkinson attacks hes having a strong second half and Wilkinson now with 14 pretty nice to have a freshman that is almost turning into a goto guy for you Roxy that doesnt happen very often but hes established that position for Cal hes earned it six St eight for Cals match their largest lead well you see Cal switching out right now uh they can do that theyre versatile its one way to play against ball screens theyve got guys one through five on the floor that can switch out but theyve got to stay out of foul trouble switch without fouling second on Joshua Ola Joseph and the bonus a one and one for Jacob Holt for sack State leading scorer for the Hornets in two of their first four games this year and and one more coming for Holt who now has 18 in this one so the senior from British Columbia one of nine players back from last year a team that reached the Big Sky Conference semifinals with a loss to eventual Champion Montana State a lot of experience well now you got Zack State seeing if they can slow Cal down with the Zone 1 three one look from the Hornets yeah Im trying to make him play out on the perimeter and shoot BS from the perimeter Spencer money Nails a three well no problem mission accomplished you want us to shoot from the perimeter Roxy we will and well nail it so the fourstar recruit that went to Washington State after doing a postgrad year in Vegas at the Red Rock Academy sat out last year for Kyle Smith transferred to Cal waiting for his opportunity with three guys out hes making the most of it here look at the defense CS just matching up on the perimeter EJ Neil and the block Andre to yakovich and its cleaned up by jaob Hol who was tied at career high with 20 well what a great block by stokovich Cal just couldnt clean up the block so Cals not you know out of the woods yet in terms of salting anything away Roxy theyve got to get some scores and stops theyve been up 10 double digits to only see Sacramento come down and take the lead Jeremiah Wilkinson and the rebound Tracked Down by Joshua Ola Joseph watched by Von who has four fouls lost the handle picked up Amil scooter races up the floor and he traveled before he hit the trailer V yeah hes got to go up with that thats thats give you the Euro Step go up but you know if youre sack State you better get out I know that they have a player out Mahoney hasnt been on the floor much but hes got some experience and he knew what to do with the corner three thats a huge shot yeah costly turnover for Sacramento State they were right there Roxy again ready to knock this lead to single digits now looking for their openings on the perimeter trying to get some isolation and drives inside 10 to shoot Andre St yakovich fouled on a three fourth on loin Brewer well I I really like what stokovich did on this Roxy you can watch what he does hes challenge but he follows through and he gets gets a piece of Hol hands thats thats really in some ways drawing a foul if he tried to go over the top and hurried his shot or got it off really quickly he would not have got the foul he just stayed with his shot got followed through and earned that very clever play probably did that against his dad in the driveway I think if his dad let him yeah his dads pretty tough his dad P you I here at the game today spent some time with my family uh what an ambassador but you know hes tough on his son he says he my sons got to get more aggressive coach talk to him I said I will but you talk to my son then because hes hes he needs to be a little more disciplined so we have a we have something worked out my son got his license Roxy and had to take his car away in one day that didnt last for 24 hours I didnt like a few things thats what dads do right welcome to paren hood you know but I like what Andre uh stovich gives this team Roxy hes so confident and when they need a basket he seemed to been the goto guy for this team all year long now8 for 11 from the line largest lead of the day for the Bears def def def def def yes sir tend to shoot Ill tell you where he is Jacob Holt in the post Julian vs tough three and there is Jeremiah Wilkinson with a head of steam up the floor Spencer Mahoney and the rebound M Soko ripped it away and the travel on Wilkinson 512 to go back over to Sacramento State and for Cal thats 11 turnovers in the ball Music game EJ Neil three second three for Neil theres no quit in the Hornets Roxy they just keep coming back if you dont put them away they will they will hang around and theyll sting you to use your quote and Neil who played last season for one of your former players Alex purle up at Idaho transferring back to Northern California the Sacramento State Hornets for the San Francisco native Spencer Mahoney attacks got his own Miss and one Spencer Mahoney with seven all in the second half and he has been a nice spark for Mark Matson Roxy this is textbook I mean you you drive it you miss your shot you stay with it and and you go right back and you just come back and get your own rebound I mean you know he missed one from the corner he missed the the the Bunny inside but he just stays with it and I mean the spark and the aggressiveness of this Cal bear team so far theyve got a number of guys that dont mind uh you know putting their bodies out there and just hustling they dont they dont leave anything to chance they they make second effort four fouls on Emil scoa Jacob Holt thought about it EJ Neil trying to create thats a good looking shot by EJ Neil me thats just a really good look C would like to take this lead and put it over the double digit Mark and Sacramento state would love to get it back and trim it hate to break it to you Ben but 12 is double digits he said extend roxs Music extend good think were friends Andre sakovich on the drive 353 to go and fouling out for sack state with scoa and Cal trying to put the finishing touches on this Music one dont forget to ask that M million dollar question what do you like about this C and Ill say a new playby play yeah thats what I want to talk about gotcha no hes just good stuff I mean theres so many guys that are just stepping up I mean I I love this Music Applause Music Applause Music Applause oh man Applause Music Music theres P see him yep I wouldnt want to piss him off by the way Andre better listen to him I Im thank you thats good stuff plus 17 Ill let you deal with that Im yeah Lee Dort and the Cal Bears bench getting involved in this one well its really important but you know what about the block party from Lee Dort look at his presence Roxy hes around the basketball he comes up with steals he blocks shot he changes your shot he he thwarts your attempt to get lobs he plays ver comes up with the basketball I mean hes everywhere look how wide he is he uses his arm span he makes it difficult you think theres an opening theres not I mean and Moko as well is just you know able to get get the this body to the basket but look at whats happened here look at the plus 17 by Mahoney Wilkinson 21 d those three guys have given the Bears a added boost you see Lee D Roxy how about adding to his his accomplishments 18 offensive rebounds on the year who wouldnt want to have that you know in Your Arsenal two shots for St yakovich after scooter fouls out well his dad is not going to be happy there may be some driveway time after this game theres P he does not does not look happy I wouldnt want to let him down I mean Im Im tough in my son but I told my son this guy I I dont know uh but you know you can be tough on on talented players thats how they get to be better you dont you dont go soft you raise the raise the Music bar fourth on Jeremiah Wilkinson and with 340 remaining sack state will go to the line now Roxy I I alluded to this earlier but you dont see Cal taking really a lot of bad shots sometimes I think they theyre a bit unselfish um but you know the shots theyve missed pretty good shots and theyve missed some some shots but they are an unselfish team its good to see Christian Tucker getting reinserted to the game had to sit with those four fouls after the flagrant but you know he hes going to be able to help this team Wilkinsons more of a two guard and he can score at such a high high clip that you need a Christian Tucker until a Javon blackshield here can get back to run this basketball team and what else do you like about this team Roxy I they have depth even with guys out they are showing you their depth thats amazing but theyre unselfish I just I just brought that up I think that they really generally want their teammates to do well sometimes they get theyre victimized by being too unselfish but they also are versatile they can play one through five they can switch out on screens uh they have the inside outside versatility so the Cal Bears have different looks and if you have flexibility I I like that as a as an attribute heres a Zone again from sack State 131 131 nice pass and the slam mon Soko but how about the feed from Joshua Ola Joseph well I like two things on that play I like that Christian Tucker threw the ball in passing again Tucker Watch the watch Tucker get it back watch the entry pass the bounce pass right into the high post high low Unstoppable Roxy you cannot stop anything when the ball goes to the high post cuz you youre not in a position to help everybodys a pass away and they were not able to get down high low against the Zone thats Picture Perfect coverage against the Zone julan bonds fouls out and the and one free throw for M Soko and the rebound grab by Jacob Holt C has left a lot of points at the line today I dont know if they have the day off or not tomorrow but if they dont they may be in the gym for some free throws but both teams have struggled a little bit for the line today Jacob Holt three and a career high 23 for Holt who Nails another three now they found something in Holt Roxy not that they didnt know they had this they knew they had it but thats going to give teams a lot of problems this year because you have to go out threepoint line and extend on him you have to well interestingly you got to got stovic as the point guard now draws the foul and two shots and Lan Brewer has now fouled out of this game yeah good good job but how about stovic Roxy playing the point talk about his versatility stick him out there at the point guard not bad the third sack State Hornet to foul out yeah heres heres the pass back to to Jacob Holt Roxy he is so deadly from three I mean shooting 50 on the year Im not so sure he wont get that percentage up he can really fill it left dakovich who is 9 for 13 from the line and two more shots coming leads Cal with 19 as four bears in double figures sack is challenged Roxy this is probably their best effort so far this year and theyve given Cal everything theyve wanted Kels had to make some big shots to extend this lead but sa State still not through theyre not done third 20point game for St yakovich who scored at least 15 points in each game this season Jacob Holt at The Rim you know just when you think hes a threepoint shooter which he is he also shows you his ability to go inside and just really get the ball off the glass now youre Cal you take time you will take as much time as you want make this a possession game burn some clock left open Joshua Ola Joseph missing from the corner and the rebound Deontay Williams inside the final two minutes in Williams the Lefty drive and batted around and its chased down by Andre sto yakovich Cal with the ball and a 10point lead that was a point blank tip sometimes may be easier to go with two but I think because of the Cal size you of just use one hand and get it up as quick as you can I think he had more time than you realized thats right so you you leave the two on the table if that would have cut it to eight Roxy would have made things awfully interesting Andre to yakovich and the shot is blocked out of bounds three on the shot clock Im okay with that drive Roxy a short clock you got to make something happen uh give sack State credit for the for the block but but you know you got to make something happen you cant for force a shot from the perimeter try to get to the line theyre asking for both benches to sit down Music please Wilkinson and short on the three EJ Neil trying to race it up the floor Neil all the way to the basket well theyre not going to call timeout theyre going to try to get steel and or a quick foul theyre not going to let too much time go off the clock here I dont believe lets see if they try to get something down I dont think theres enough time left in this game Roxy if you let the time The Possession go I I I just I think theres just not enough time for SEC Jeremiah Wilkinson into the KE Joshua Ola Joseph at the end of the shot clock and a violation of turnover by Cal 354 remaining well you know they turned the ball over Roxy but theres 35 seconds to go on the clock on the clock rather than get a shot they did the right thing they exhausted the shot clock I am okay with that dont think theres enough time for Music sack and a foul yeah Mark Manson said You know guys do anything you want and a technical been called yeah thats nice Soko with the foul and then a technical and he has fouled out of this game well I said the fourth is a personal and the technical is the fifth and Soko is done Roxy I was wrong I said theres not much time you can do in 35 seconds but I also didnt think thered be a foul and a technical and the ball in sacks hands wow what a un what a developing story this is one more for EJ Neil they must not want fans to go back leave early to this game this is a real opportunity for sack rocks Neil makes both its a sixpoint game rather yes a sixpoint game with 286 no Mark Madson is not happy and and Mar Marx is one of the more jovial guys youll meet and hes such a positive guy but Roxy when your players do this uh theres going to be some butts chewed in that huddle I can promise you promise you that hes too intense a guy Ive coached against Mark Matson he will not uh have this one hes not having um cuz this game should have been salted away 35 seconds and now youre giving sax State a chance to maybe cut this thing to one possession so a sixpoint game sooko fouls out with the personal and then the technical and coming up for the Hornets theyre at Air Force part of this exempt round robin Mercy Hurst who cow will play here coming up on Wednesday then a trip to Du for sack States Omaha then the causeway classic against UC Davis also on ESPN plus yeah thats going to be just a little bit of a highway drive down to Davis but I can tell you Davis is going to be a tough game we know that firsthand with Jimmy Less team uh but this is interesting Roxy theres going to be some free throws now I dont think I would not think that Sacramento States going to let much time go off this clock theyve got to make an early push for a fouler or Neil the technicals This Is the personal foul on Soko as Spencer Mahoney replaced him Applause 286 and one for two fivepoint game that was a violation Cal may have turned it over on a violation there I thought that was a violation although the clock did run so oh that made a save Cal Jerry heer our lead referee comes to the table well good to good to be at home H RS and the officials are discussing this now watch the ball okay Mahoney goes to no he never went out of bounds everything was okay if hed gone out of bounds and flipped it that would have been the problem but he never went out of bounds he just shoveled it over to Christian Tucker Al those suck thats why theres no violation well heres a dead ball again so watch sack try to get a steal if not they should be an immediate foul Cal looking to break the pressure and a block and now Bailey nun has fouled out of the game that was close Roxy that was a bang bang but how about if that goes for sack State as a charge and they have a chance to cut this lead to two still Cal has to make some free throws and they have not been very successful at the line 23 for 35 from the line Michael Wilson will come in for sack State his first appearance of the day with 25 seconds to go as four different Sacramento State players have fouled out right there theres been uh its been a unfortunate but again you got to make Cal make some free throws not enough time to hope for steals if you get it out of a double team one more for Wilkinson and now is 15 Off the Bench this is a big one to make it a three possession game yeah you forget hes a freshman Roxy I mean what a bright spot hes been uh theyre counting on him to give his team a lift and those are two big free throws 8275 on the drive and the lane Deontay Williams and now the Press from the Hornets maybe a foul here coming off the ball a little bit ball comes in Ola Joseph and hes fouled the fourth on Deontay Williams now thats a good foul no time off and maybe he makes the free throws Roxy but maybe you come down and get three so thats why youve got to play time and possession you must know how much time is on the clock at all times olot Joseph three for four from the line today nine points for the Minnesota transfer along with six rebounds well Im very smart for marike Matson taking no chances getting his players out of the lane no chance for offensive rebounds and and F trying to go for an offensive season I 10 for Ola Joseph now last year average seven and a half at Minnesota again to make it a three possession game stays at two possession gam sack state has one timeout Cal has two on the drive and the block Jeremiah Wilkinson elevating to block the shot of Deontay Williams out of bounds how about the smallest player on the floor Roxy with the big block took a chance because you dont want to get a put him at the line but my goodness that was just a send back Zack trying to draw the foul couldnt get it not over Wilkinson he didnt he wasnt subscribing to that subscription ball comes in EJ Neil and a three no good the rebound underneath and the kick out kept alive Michael Wilson missing a three and Lee Dort rips it away and thatll do it Cal got a scare Zack State just wouldnt go away and just when he thought Cal was going to create separation the Hornets hang in there and Cal hangs
