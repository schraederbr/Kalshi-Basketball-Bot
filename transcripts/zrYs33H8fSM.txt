smaller player on him hell take him down low in the post hes got great footwork and hes can raise up over the smaller Defender but what makes him dangerous his ability to put the ball down on the floor and play off the bounce this is a guy thats seven feet uh he has become a matchup nightmare and a key matchup tonight against Boston College well you see the 16 the other night against Ohio State hes been double figures in all nine ball games so far for John Shire you see the four double doubles as well so philipowski is off to a terrific start in his Duke career yes Derek Lively highly thought of Mark Mitchell highly thought of and Tariq Whitehead seems to be starting to round into form as well but its this young man philipowski from West Town New York whos stolen the show early and his numbers when we spoke with John Shire this afternoon and shoot around he said the thing thats been impressive to him yes hes put up good offensive numbers defensively though hes seen him better defensively out sliding on guards hes pleading player the story for Boston College theyve won three of their last five and two of three but unfortunately for Earl Grant his second season has started with injuries and theres the biggest one seven foot Quentin post averaging nine and a half points at five and a half rebounds a year ago Malcolm hes just been unable to get started with this campaign yeah and its really hurts you obviously on the road at Duke with their length and size thats a big void this afternoon against this new team its going to be at least another couple of weeks before post is even potentially serviceable for the Eagles of Boston College Lively wins the tap with TJ Bickerstaff and Jeremy roach if you will the old man of the Blue Devil order the Junior from Leesburg Virginia gets us started with the opening possession and a pass by the Mitchell and we and we foul on Mason transfer from Cincinnati its his first and the first of course on the Eagles and West you can see the early strategy for Duke clear size Advantage with Mitchell there not messing around theyre throwing the ball directly inside to the post roach Proctor Mitchell Lively with philipowski and this is the Aussie Proctor Music redraws the assignment on roach came to shoot for Mitchell heres philipowski now Roach Applause hell launch and the back room Miss and the rebound pulled away by CJ Pena Jr Music its in Bickerstaff and the aforementioned Pena and the drive its in Langford on the board its a goaltend against the Blue Devils and half the first points of the game behind their leading scorer ball screen coverage thats going to be key against Boston College we saw Duke this afternoon and shoot around going over this that time Lively flattened out did not Edge allow Langston apart John shark told us says we dont want Boston College in our paint today right there is the opening drive of the ball game phillipowski trying to cross over gets right to the iron got bothered by Music having a circling dribble by Makai all the way through shot in traffic is missed heres Mitchell in the Blue Devils good philipowski the catch and shoot long rebound pulled away and thats Bickerstaff thats a great block out that time by Jade and Zachary giving up a lot of signs to Lively getting into his legs and thats going to be keyed for Boston College keeping Music with Proctor looking Lively help here staffs hands Zachary from madsons three Applause a rebound pulled away finally philipowski Second Chance opportunity here in the last couple of possessions for BC and both teams stressed that nice pass and a lively dump freshman from Philadelphia has his first points but a terrific gift from Tyrese Proctor they Rave about Proctors basketball IQ that time manipulating the ball screen thats a beautiful pass until Applause its a relate to shoot Zachary will try and drive the ball scores Jayden Zachary last three ball games averaged 12 points but just 10 of 25 from the full and rarely do you see teams working on post defense with their guards thats something Duke did John Shire concerned the PC guards will post up on the board Malcolm well I mean he has become a matchup problem early on and again not too many holes in his game offensively can shoot it you play off the bounce and has a great post game as well Zachary spends a three out Applause Music this is where one of his strengths really lies his ability to handle theres Proctor trying to answer it three Tanya pulls it away Duke has from a length perspective heres Peyton into the basket cant finish Dukes got guys like philipowski youve got Lively at seven feet you got Mitchell whos a 68 guy who can handle the ball roach a long two and it will hit the shot clock and bounce back into play and that will bring us a couple of substitutions well right here again you take a look at this pass by uh Proctor uh his IQ thats what they talk about now has not shot the ball well from the perimeter but but sizing making thats something that the coach ing staff has talked about at an early stage once they got him on the Boston College Im impressed theyre blocking out it might be a little thing something you dont talk about a lot in broadcast but its so big when youre giving up that much size Boston College early on is doing a nice job keeping Duke off the offensive lap a couple of changes here for Boston College tomorrow Langford has come in the ball game as Zachary drives he got slapped off the glass by Lively as we played four minutes here at Cameron we also get our first look at Devin McLaughlin who had a terrific night a loss of Nebraska the other 93 ball from Chaz Kelly is good well find by Demar Langford thats all set up by a beautiful drive to the Baseline and then a nice diagonal pass and thats what youre gonna have to do with your boss to college knock down those open looks 73 of the year for Kelly puts BC in front heres Tariq Whitehead whos into the ball game for the first time live and Lively over his hand second field goal for Derek Lively see he is just starting to get healthy early on obviously battling the injury but I think that bounce impacting this game on both ends another deflection by Lively Whitehead on the drive and an offensive foul called on Tariq Whitehead freshman from New Jersey draws his first first on the Blue Devils but Dukes ACC Network basketball is presented by Subway try the allnew Subway series menu your pick of 12 irresistible Subs well back during the pandemic as evidenced by the empty Cameron right Wendell Moore the game winner last time they played here January 6 2021 and of course coach came missed the game with covet protocols Boston College had 21 turnovers at one bill Moore at 16 of the 25 in the second half and hey CJ Felder hit 24 and a tight loss I mean that one right there coming down to the wire but I remember that shot from the corner he talked to us about that Japan shy or that shot man you a look at his resume we were talking about it off here I think people need to be reminded of how good of a player John Shire was that dude was a bucket and certainly now this year first year head coach he was he was ever case Award winner at the ACC tournament Greensboro Music Maryland Blake has checked in the ball game roach and Whitehead out there to for a double Music team change up right there were going to find out what happened to Makai Ashton Langford right now though you have a freshman point guard in there John Shire switches up and goes to full court pressure see if they can get a turnover find something were going to monitor as this game goes along Music hes got two and is on the floor here Zachary with Kelly Demar Langford also has their TJ pickerstaff who scores on the layup senior from Atlanta on the board with his first points he was scoreless the other night in Lincoln only three points in the win against Rhode Island unless you cant ask for a better start if your Boston College and girl Grant everything at the basket and youre getting five percent of shots Ryan young a little shot fake and easy layup for the Northwestern Grand transfer I think Ryan you know integral part of what Duke is ultimately going to become this year and you look at what both Pete Ryan young and Jacob brand Music of Team points what a luxury Zachary three to shoot far away there is good Becker staff back to back field goals and Malcolm maybe a guy looking for a little confidence has got the last four for the Eagles well hes their best rebounder one of battle some injuries in pass but certainly he has the length and athleticism to compete right here and I like the heads up play uh I Jaden Zachary realizing there is a mismatch that time in the post and there is Earl Grant of course a native of North Charleston South Carolina hell turn 46 on Christmas Day of course with Brad Brownell he did a terrific job not a good job a great job at College of Charleston before becoming BCs new hit guy now in his second season 36 games with the college there is Young inside again thats for going alone for Ryan Young Applause I read a preseason article on young where they described him as a guy that creates issues he does create issues he showed you right there well hes just a veteran hes a guy that you can throw it to end him to post and right here communication issues uh this right here the great deep offense a Baidu Ryan young just knows how to play great post position and thats just miscommunication though by Boston College they got to do a better job pushing Duke looking for its first lead grandison another lob and catch for young and He will draw the fact thats going to be on McLaughlin itll be his first and that will be the third foul on Boston College Music and thatll send young to the line 84 free throw shooters only missed three times in 19 tries up next following our coverage here Cameron off to Championship weekend in uptown Charlotte twohour preview of the ACC

rotation perspective havent been able to practice were doing a lot of game prep but not really practicing and you said it over the Christmas break I think thats when hell get a lot of work in but theyre still really excited about what he brings for this lineup for Antonio Music McLaughlin China launches another one and the rebound for Whitehead Applause Young young grandison will launch Applause ninth triple of the year for Jacob grandison Applause its a breakdown about Boston College but graniton is the one seven nothing else pushed it to a fourpoint lead ER into the front Court

first personal third on College locker room it is a right hamstring strain weve been told his status is questionable he is going to sit on Earl Grants bench you see him greeted by Corey McRae the first year assistant coach of BC and he nodded Im okay but hell stay seated on that BC bench well keep an eye on it Malcolm because Duke started to engineer some things with Ryan young Livelys been beneficial here Boston College needs their leading scorer here too yeah I mean obviously the leading scorer I think the bigger thing though is the professor might do as soon as he went out of the game John Shire immediately shifted to a full court pressure and forced a couple of turnovers I think thats going to be a key thing to watch see if hes able to get back into the game they need a scoring and leadership in the lineup heres his younger brother Demar who is six of 11 at the line this year with a threepoint trip Music or a year ago average 10 points in Conference Point Music principal first eight ball games of the year one swing heres roach on the drive scooped up Mitchell had it blocked Music Boston College so here is Mark Mitchell The Freshman from Kansas City by way of Sunrise

bound teams in their matchups coverage coverage tomorrow night nine oclock Eastern right here on acc Network and always all the ESP Mitchell kind of a flat look to the shop Mountain yeah and I something I spoke with the coaching staff about theyre trying to address that now hes shooting a high percentage from the threepoint line that he needs to get a little bit more parking on that and the Boston College early on in this game controlling the pace and Tempo and I think the key thing was getting into the paint yep here is DeMar Langford going to work on Mitchell now help from Lively on a double team and and another one shot clock violation of Boston College well the bay Duke forced the double team and Matson took a low percentage shot yeah great rotation good defensive possession that time by Duke and I think a missed opportunity Langford had a cutter to the basket just missed them the Trap was that good Music Applause one point lead for the Blue Devils from early basket Proctors had a beautiful assist but its still scoreless here in this opening half Mitchell on the drive lost it over the inline out of bounds against langfords pressure turn over on the bluebells Duke has been open one this season eight times theyve won the rebound margin eight times theyve won the turnover March and Boston College almost turned it over there struggles right now coming into this game now for more turnovers than they do assists but thats something that girl Grant and staff are addressing uh with this team right here cannot turn the ball over against this new team Earl Grant gave us some fascinating thoughts today as when it comes to game management he said you have to have the ability to communicate in this building shoot free throws in this building theres Matson in the traffic Applause three ball thats Pena Korean Duke trying to flip the floor Proctor heres the Lebowski and thats McLaughlin defending him at the post nice turn and land Music four four ski thats the problem right there and pearl Grants got a decision to make if youre going to stay man good to start doubling filipowski heres a double on Langford for a nice pass inside mcglockton the catch and score for Boston College excellent offense out of the Trap that time by Boston College pinpoint passing the point lead for the Blue Devils theres a whistle and Bill Covington Jr has cited both philipowski and McLaughlin here I believe Applause got some of the best footwork Applause offensively Earl Grant must be pleased with how his team is executing against this full court pressure from Duke last week spoke with John Tyler this afternoon he said look our guys are going to get a taste of ECC basketball he knew it was going to be a physical game and it has not disappointed early on Music double fouls have been called one on phillipowski which is his first and then another one on Devin McLaughlin which is his second Music event on BC in the fourth on Duke and you see me lock thats out and picker staff is back for Coach Grant Applause Ed Applause shoulder hit the far sideline Ted Valentine professional grants thought on communication remember when he said we got to shoot free throws and I kind of had a questionable look and I was like okay whats the Magic in the free throws because thats where you can talk he said because once I give the play the plays got to be the Go Changing he said I dont got it right now Music really Korean in charge the road stepped right in front Jaden Zachary now with two he becomes the second eagle with a pair at six on BC yeah its great defense by Jeremy Rhodes that time but Jaden Zachary but if youre going to turn it over obviously you dont want to but its not a live ball turnover thats something Earl Grant talked about we cannot let this crowd go crazy off of live ball turnovers Applause Ki nice couple with Kelly Applause first 23 coming in Jacob Grandersons in two of three here already in the first half Duke by four and thats why hes so important to this lineup he spaces the floor if you double now hes going to make excellent by Duke not for Lankford Applause switch Pena launches back for a Miss Lively Music Applause Music Derek Lively Music Lively Blue Devils are big their biggest Hurd and Applause grandison trying to skip it back got knocked away here Zachary BC in transition just one of eight from behind the line it belongs to Kelly whos got the rock tank off a gilpowski shes out on him Kenosha by the young freshman settle for jumpers this missed opportunities nice move by Kelly though Paul just not going Music again working on thicker staff and a hand check I think on TJ pickerstaff will get us to a timeout he becomes the third eagle with two seven now on BC and a moment ago Derek Lively finishes the law from the castle in Blacksburg North Carolina trying to snap a threegame skid and The Elixir is to win at Virginia Tech Malcolm my goodness that could be a good one that place is going to be rocking so three oclock tip time from Castle Coliseum right here on acc Network and always available on the espnf mccayerson Langford went to the table to check back in a moment ago and thats huge for Boston College theyre obviously they need his points production I think the biggest thing against this Duke pressure you want to limit the turnovers and having your primary ball handler back on the court that is good news for Earl Grant and Boston College Music so Kyle phillipowski will be at the line Duke has seven of their lastowski by the way leads Duke in free throw shooting at 82 percent yeah and the front end of the one and one is good and look no disrespect to this youngster here but we heard a lot about Whitehead and Lively and not as much about philipowski and Proctor who reclassified obviously and as a member of this freshman class but what a terrific start hes got I caught their opener against Jacksonville and all he did was do uh skills again I think the big John Shire mentioned it this afternoon defensively Applause he sees had a drown him almost three minutes Applause 6 well great pass right here by Demar Langford right there looked like it was going to be a open dunk good contest at the REM Music but thats better offense by Boston College not settling for a three and that ball touched by Blakes I want to tell you you dont have to watch Duke play long to figure out two in the white is a defensive end hes a key piece of what they want to do in your absolutely so much stuff all pressure makes it really difficult for opposing guards to run the offense Delight for now remember play with a bit of a hand straps the shoe rolling off the passkey back the other way tough shot CJ Banyan level first step and then nice little jump over after glass Applause if you will High School in Indiana three years there then one year at division two Trevecca Nazarene Music and now Spends His coveted year Boston College he didnt think he was going to be a guy that was going to get many minutes but all the injuries Applause two of the day Applause today Boston College just one of eight and shooting just 32 Applause for blinks squeeze his Baseline and couldnt finish the reverse and thats stolen my leg OS everybody will run down there and jump in the folks Ashton Langford challenges Music uterus Proctor with Kelly in front first points for Tyrese Proctor 112 the Blue Devil Run here and a timeout for Earl Grant Applause Blue Devils transition Proctor the finish on Kelly on Jacob grandison started Holy Cross then went to Illinois and now he gets the covered here at Duke Malcolm a lot of frequent Ill tell you what hes doing for this Duke team stretching the defense and down a little girl I think the biggest thing is him and Ryan young both know those guys are coming in off the bench oh my gosh right for providing so much offense and I think the leadership thats the key thing that John Shire talked about hes got a young talented group for about these older guys are providing that leadership Boston College trailing 10 its been a tough half for the Eagles shooting 130 percent just one of nine from three and theyve had some respectable looks as well through traffic here its only on Mitchell Applause Scott 11 baskets all nine assists first half ten and the Blue Devils to kind of animals here in this first tournament owski with seven to shoot quicker staff trying to defend three racks back to the left right shoulder got his own rebound Applause first field goal for Mark Mitchell City and down on the floor is TJ Bickerstaff here okay he feels like TJ Bickerstaff was elbowed in the top of the head take a look at the replay but it looks like TJ Bickerstaff took a pretty hard elbow from philipowski on the offensive rebound and and Nick gallato the trainer for Boston College out to have a look keep an eye on one here Music thats a thats thats an overtoback right there clearly there was contact just gonna walk to the Boston College locker room here at Cameron Music Bill Covington Junior will come to the table and theyll go through the process here with the bonder and theyll see the angles that weve shown you plus maybe one or two more now hes going for uh the rebound now again theres nothing intentional about it right but anytime you make contact again hes quickly I mean hes definitely on his back and its a basketball play again hes going to get an offensive rebound but Grant is upset about is is that there was no overtoback call on the play right and I think thats the explanation youre saying right here look hes going Music hes going Jeff hardness will hand the ball into Pena Music to run here in the last five nights to 12 point lead floor and theres a foul on Flakes trying to defend payment Jalen Blakes the sophomore from Somerset New Jersey draws his first that is five on the living Blakes is one of those guys that quite frankly he got lost a year ago people didnt realize you know he only played two minutes in conference play and only apparently lost again Applause he got her shot they lost him on the tap in too thats good out of bounds underneath by Boston Collins and one of the few easy opportunities theyve had in the last stretch point lead for the Blue Devils Wilkowski and Lively and theres Brooks for three 133 of the Year first basket of the day for Roach long nap time excellent wall movement and Patience by Duke osis back to a 13point advantage jumper Applause Music screen a roach in the shoe Lively trying to help the screen the legs on twopointer WOW Music Applause Music set up because the basket I mean Music your biggest lead of the first half for Duke Langford Inside swatted Out by Mitchell McLaughlin the rebound against Lively on a foul thatll be the first online got it clean one McLaughlin did on that to his body you cannot fade away again against blocker look at this he went right up into his chest thats how youre gonna have to attack a guy like Eric Lively hes got hes got timing on his shot blocking you cannot fade away hes going to get his hands on the Points 11 rebounds Music the first straight double figure games for the sophomore from coming Georgia he redshirted last season but his last three games he started to give you seven rebounds hes got five in the first half and leads BC and scoring by the way final minute Eagles Trail by 14 and Applause Roach into the corner Blakes hard without Applause Branch team and theyre gonna like the way they shot the ball but but catch and shoot and McLaughlin the rebound PC can hold for the shop we get a whistle on the foul thats on plates hes the second Blue Devil with two and now one and one with Music you said it was theyve had a couple of good looks yeah that last one by Jaden struggles behind on the road if youre going to pull off this upset you got to knock some of those down one of ten will not do it Music well send you to Charlotte coming up here in a moment at halftime Applause Music and McLaughlin will go to the line hell come into junior getting a few things sorted out Applause come here branched some really nice job taking over this program I mean a year ago its hard 13 saw the pillars going to ground or what he wants to build on them well I think the big thing for him Dave is that was an identity of what they want to do they want to be a defensive team and be a good founding team roach got in the front Court he flew through a double team and Duke will use a timeout here before they take the final shot of the half Duke by a dozen at the break Malcolm heres a quick summary is part of our eat fresh refresh brought to you by Subway and Boston College struggled especially in the last 241 but the field goal percentage numbers not pretty either oh its definitely not a thing of beauty I think the big number one to ten for Boston College if youre going to upset Duke on the road youre gonna have to knock some of those down on the other side though we saw some pretty good ball movement from dude well and balance for the Blue Devils not just scoring balance and rebounding balance and assist balance on defense really and its something John Shire has freaked from day one right here after the double team excellent kickoff you can he can take shot the ball well into first down and then philipowski a matchup nightmare for the smaller guy on him theyll take him down low in the post spread the floor out and Lively you can tell hes starting to get healthy uh theyre throwing the lob to him more excellent ball movement and then the leader Jeremy ropes getting into the action Grant on the other side there were some positives yep again they had some quality looks uh early on in that game they were able to get into the paint theyre gonna have outside shots as simple as that they had some looks theyre going to have to knock them down in the second half the 273 shooting by Boston College is Dukes best half defensively six the USC Upstate had back about a month ago November 11th was when shires team put that 30 or that 20 minutes of work on the floor and the 12point lead and the Blue Devils the ball here to start half two in Cameron Duke is going to be in Gotham City on Tuesday night at the Garden as part of the Jimmy B classic against Iowa and there goes phillipowski for his third field goal gonna score or youre going to have to follow him a Boston College in particular big staffs going to have to push him out of the peak he cant catch it with two feet inside see guys with two fouls on both squads about as we start the second half as well this is paying crossover around Philadelphia flipped it up and in with a right hand I was getting ready to say old school yeah there and thats a tough shot and first five minutes of the second half I think thats going to be a ball game for Boston counter theyre going to hang around said Ill find out shortly but thats a good start offensively they dont know about pain it matches the marker and theres a foul on Boston College college with his second its the first on BC in the half and here is a young man who was scheduled to be here next year Tyrese Proctor who reclassified in early June from Sydney and New South Wales and a member of the NBAs Global Academy in Canberra thats the free throw down and heres the deal there is a Mets Talent here but he benefited from playing against older guys in Australia almost every time he took the floor the last three years he was playing against highlevel players in Australia as you know that part of the worlds got some pretty good basketball it is very difficult and thats something John Shire talked with us about why he plays more mature than his age again hes been played against some for a very long time a lead to 14 now for the blue guns and a deflection by Procter by the way weve just gotten word from the Boston College folks that Makai Ashton Langford will not come back in this second half so the leading scorer for BC will finish with just two points and he will beat to the bench a Earl Grant the rest of the afternoon with that strained right hamstring that is huge but you say coming out of the tip theyre gonna have to knock down uh some of these threes that one contested in Deep by painting yep second three of the day for the Eagles he had one in the first half and Ted Valentine a whistle and CJ Pena raises his hand first of the game on opinion so a little bit of the uh third shift game right scoop and score into paint and then come out here and touch me if you want to that way there Ill tell you what degree of difficulty for both of those were pretty tough theres a proctor battling Matson good hustle play by Matson but Proctors got it in the corner wrote to three Music philipowski trying to keep it alive we got bodies on the floor but Langford leading the break Tanya from Madison standing three spins out and and we had a kick by Mitchell into the scores table itll stay with Boston College Boston College I think the adjustment that Earl Grant has made team defensive Duke a very good offensive rebounding team a team rebounding has been good for Boston College to start out of this second half that means all five guys are in on the defensive glass blocking out Music I just got all five points for BC here in the second half lemon point lead for Duke Zachary Bickerstaff Music Applause shoot for Victor Stewarts got a let it go under the short second shot clock violation of the day forced by the blue guys thats all set up by deer if I get credit for his shot block but he definitely impacted the shot that time by Langford five turnovers all Boston College Whitley perduke here is Lively roach the law second time that one has worked off the chalkboard for John Shire Music from Team point game again just better than three gone in half two lets see all the way underneath nice pass painting The Catch scoop wouldnt go but Music his third field going Boston College hanging around without their leaders on defense running performance to start off this second half Mitchell against the bump on the foul Music John Pena his second its the third on BC Mitchells got his second field goal and hell toe the line report back over more slide his feet see if he can pick up the charge right there but thats good body control by Mitchell to avoid the charge Mitchell knocks down the free throw hes got five Applause points in the McDonalds AllAmerica Game and just kind of lifted his profile the Durham is a rookie theres Zachary nice pass quick movement into the corner three ball away and two strong Music tried to bounce it through the crease to Lively Duke turns it over in transition thatll take us to a timeout Blue Devils have a 14 point advantage and twice today the alleyoop to Derrick Lively has produced buckets for Duke 14 Boyd lead falcomm heres just a breakdown of the Blue Devil rosters seven freshmen 11 of the 15 new to the roster and I think the mix thats what youre going to see now and I think johnshire and staff had did a nice job balancing it out yeah you have somebody like Jeremy roach out on the floor right now Ryan young and I think grandison when them in with this mix of talented freshmen it gives you multiple lineups that you can use the mobility of The Bigs Lively and Philip houski I think thats key for them and the ball screen coverage uh it really I think its not a complete product yet all right but hes got a lot of options to deal with but and you know this from bouncing around we talked to a lot of coaches about roster composition took four grand transfers you got to make sure youre taking the right grad transfer too a guy who understands you mentioned this first half young and grandison understand the role embrace the role and if team chemistry I think is a huge thing thats just part of the process now for all these coaches a better right getting the right theyre trying to accomplish Jaden Zachary the sophomore Salem Wisconsin and Music lets see Applause tend to shoot Zach rich boy young doing Music a second field goal three nice little hesitation dribble in first layup in traffic heres Whitehead gets out Proctor catch and shoot Applause a seven five here and a half Duke lead 15 Blue Devils have hit their last three shots from the floor to extend the margin here Music Applause Proctors gonna bail out Matson and itll be the first on Proctor first on Duke and a half this move right here sophomore Jaden Zachary nice little hesitation of front on the other side thats something they started the game off with West they were able to break down this goop deep and get into the paint that has not been the case and it could close out the first half and start off the second Boston College for the first time in seven games has six seven freshmen Prince a league back on the floor Malcolm we saw him work out this morning and Earl Gray gonna give him some run here in the second half as Zachary knocks down three so five straight Boston College points for Jayden Zachary Malik Bay is a young Prospect theyre excited about but hes been limited to two games and then an injury missed the last six but makes his return to the lineup here tonight Whitehead has a long to spin out heres Matson Applause in traffic against two Blue Devils a league bang front or in Miss of a three just his second try from behind the line in this young season Applause another rebound Brian Youngs pretty good bastard he got a break that time Boston College youre right that was a nice pass Langford along too Music for a 12point game thats not Boston Colleges strength again theyve struggled shooting the ball their best offense has been when theyve been patient and they inside the key and young going to be called for the foul here by Jeff Hardin a second on Ryan young its two on Duke and a half and here comes Mitchell on the on the floor to spell Proctor as you see young litigating with Jeff hardness quick reminder to your Championship Saturday

College averages 46 threes a game theyve hit three today two here in the second half but theyre still trailing double figures as young and travels turn over by Ryan young I think the big foul from Northwest are a little frustrated yeah and the guts great defense by McLaughlin and giving up ground again a Youngs a guy that will dislodge guys with his physical post play at that time McLaughlin held his ground forced the turnover excellent individual post defense thats the turnover on Duke Music Jazz Kelly and Matson theres Zachary is spot up too well seven and a half Malcolm in the initiative clear with number three and I like that uh put the young and a ball screen uh not that good sliding his feet thats excellent offense and recognition by Boston College College Point game Applause Music Applause scores with a lot Applause Music of the left half seven in the game for City rookie Mark Mitchell thats one of the really improving defensive forces in the ACC and Blakes out

hes now got nine in the ball game this is his second trip to the line hes three for three West the thing that has been impressive but thus far about this new team and their victories of the balance go back to the Ohio State game five players in double digits they can they can multiple areas theyve been sound defensively but John Shire again has breached sharing the ball and theyve done it again tonight yep sure have 10 and another double figure game for filipowski Zachary and the length for the floor now has not only Prince of League Bay but Bonnie mighty Mighty whos a candidate for name of

were doing a lot of game prep in between these games about that Chris Christmas holiday break in 10 days where he can have these guys and I think he also said something interesting but these young guys giving them a break as well too a mental break because he knows how the season can be wow mini coats at any level and now Bill Covington Jr is stopped the game and he is talking with the clock folks here I was saying being alive I think might be up the reset to 30 and 10 48 to play its 27 so the shot clock did not start when the ball was put in play and thats why the ball game stopped by
