Music Herman at seven and three Applause its a good firming team team that well talk about is you know the game goes on this team is returning a lot from a team that was one shot away from making NCAA tournament themselves and here we go tonight from NC State itll also be very hardpressed to find a better officiating crew here on this one Roger Ayers Doug sermons and Brian OConnell three of the very best in college basketball Furman with Sloss in here at the top for their top talents Jalen Slauson number 20 they get it inside and the first bucket of the game put in by Furman and thats Garrett Heen because youre starting five for NC State tonight how good is sharkell Joyner to complement sir quavion Smith for the wolf pack theyre playing like the best backcourt in the ACC right now if not the country you know Smith is a great off guard but has point guard skills and jaquel Jones is just a tremendous leader and does so much for this Wolfpack team Casey Marcel missing on the fade away rebound DJ Burns keeps it alive foreign state getting Burns getting getting offensive extra possession there on the glass finding finding Shooters and no ones shooting a basketball right now better than Casey Marcel second inning ACC at 48 and hes shooting the lights out right now and just to add a piece to his game hes just improved threepoint shooting every year yeah 29th made three of the year for him four off the team lead from Smith wolf pack the other way off the Miss three Joyner now puts up a three ball thats in and out NC State wants to play at a faster Pace I think Lumbers mislead you Berman wants to play in a faster Pace but they want to play it faster half court case and executing their offense Marcus Foster got inside and got knocked out last Touch by Furman and Kevin Keats now in his sixth season for the wolf pack and remember going back to his days Hargrave Military Academy 10 years there had 103 players signed division one scholarships 18 more of the division two level and the assistant in Louisville in three years of UNCW as a head coach so many connections right how many people does that guy know I mean hes even from his coaching tree and he has guys on the staff that have gone on to Coach and hes been around a long time coach many great players is Marcel with another three his second of the night the first turn over here Nancy State wants to get after their pressure they need to turn Furman over to eliminate having to guard all those Princeton actions Applause more south only player in the ACC with two games at six plus threes made on the season hes off to the hot start again here tonight two for two from the outside six to two wolf pack Applause and again he checks out there well you had told me earlier today before the game you felt like they had to get turnovers and look they get another one here again this is the type of game that NC State wants to play when theyre at their best just attacking you with Pace creating turnovers I think 15 is the number that they want to get you because they they press you so much I think thats just something thats a big part of the game Bob Ritchie just 39 years old head coach for Furman his sixth season as well out of the job that hes done to take this program that was really dormant right before he got there and what theyve done over the last five six years as he told us earlier just development retention and consistency hes had in his tenure at at firm is just what happened 22 wins last year and a last second shot away from making the NCAA tournament got upset in the conference Championship burns on the jumper another steal here and a threepointer by Clark and that is tracked down to keep it alive is Smith Clark has fouled ideal star for the Wolfpack and he forcing our turnovers theyre getting at the threes that they want to get into the shooters early on and everything you want you got Burns inside when things settle down and this is the start that you want for the wolf pack three turnovers already for Furman what was the deal there in that Miami game for NC State when they lost the last game by seven it just didnt force enough tournament but I think they only for six against Miami and thats a big issue for them I mean they they theyre better when theyre not having to slow down in the half court and run sets they just want to get out and run attack you off the bounce and spread you out and creating turnovers has been a staple and for Coach Keats in this state program and he couldnt do it as much here ago and I asked him in the preseason before this team went on a Foreign Tour they said hey you know you didnt press as much and hes like hey man chill I didnt have bodies I couldnt do it you know guys would wear down so I think he has enough bodies right now hes probably looking for a little bit more bench production but again I think hes solidified in this starting group right now Jalen Slauson was called for the foul for Furman and Jack Clark has made it a 102 game here this answered that first basket scored by Furman its a 100 run here by NC State Applause and Cincinnati to look to switch a lot I think they feel comfortable switching everything but when you get this kind of matchup right here size wise you want to take advantage of it good rotation here on this offensive set and its JP pagis that knocks down a three ball just great offense theyve got the Mitch Match they wanted and credit to Slauson just got the Mitch Mack he wanted to put him on a hit Force rotation and make Burns couldnt help they did swung it out got an open look Hearns being denied by Keen in the post hes given up a little bit of size there inside so expect Burns to touch it a little bit more and heres the takeaway first turnover of the night for NC State Music wow as Bothwell was trying to go Baseline we talked about the difference in Pace both teams wants to score in the 80s but the difference is fireman wants to play with Pace in their half court sets I think State wants to play the entire length of the court and he used to play 94 feet whereas firm on a runoff turnovers but they would like to carve you up and with that multioff fasted offense cuts and moving without the ball these dhos and gotta guard this guy Boswell so tough and kicks it after Foster from for three its no good a foul in the rebound its going to be on Foster previous foul was on turquoitian Smith for NC State last night college football just lost a really special coach remembering Mike Leach when we come back after this we love our new home theres so much space but we have ants expired inspired its a lot of help I hope you can keep it clean at least Geico makes bundling our home and car insurance easy for bundling Made Easy Go to geicocom machine Music

Music Music back in the days when I was young Im not a kid anymore Applause I started playing and never stop playing you get the most from the game when youre having fun devastating the college football world and of course in Mississippi State head coach Mike Leach passed away last night at 61 years of age so sad to hear this Randolph and you can only imagine you know whats going through his familys mind that players the everyone in Mississippi State and Beyond and our thoughts and prayers were at The Bleach family yeah I mean prayer is all to his family the Mississippi State their community in college athletics in general I mean sometimes you get so caught up in the competitiveness of games and to give people who lose great people and none greater than Mike Leach I mean just an unbelievable personality and a heck of a football coach and hell be missed by many and that that Community needs your prayers right now his family needs your prayers right now Applause were all feeling the loss of that and I understand how that can be at times being at a you know Wake Forest and if youve been around Wake Forest and anyone will tell you skip Prosper losing skip Prosper to this day his name his his his just communication with the people everything about him is just still in that building and you cant walk around Winston and walk around Wake Forest campus and not make a good problem Im pretty sure right now thatll be the case down in Mississippi State so again prayers to him and that the community and his family and just a tough difficult day I was able to call his final home game this past season stubborn month ago you know he spent an hour with us just talking and it wasnt even about football as we all know hes so funny great personality he made the job made the job fun and theres not a lot of people like that his impact on the game would be long felt with his with the staff and people that hes done I mean just unbelievable man and hell be daily missed agreed foul was on Alex Williams for Furman as DJ Burns capped off the threepoint play 135 wolf pack here shot clock another takeaway fourth turnover of the game Smith hands it back off and the shot is rejected Slawson they had a chance for the easy two and instead its firming the other way here with Bothwell and thats the two inside they needed for Tyrese Huey both teams defended at a high levels NC State just swarming but its lost in there just shows you why hes just so con reigning Defensive Player of the Year there hes a twoway guy comes down chase down block from behind and nearly swings a full point possession itll be taken away two from NC State this morning on the other end threepointer Jack Clark worry about it by Slauson Applause Music Lets Travel great job about NC State thats a scout report play Stand Down on the shot play swarming around just active on the ball here but look at Slauson coming down not giving up on a play chase down block saving his team two points and they go down and score in the other wrenches hes a twoway player again so con Defensive Player of the Year and hes a guy that can switch guard the ball garbage not many versatile Defenders like him in college basketball coming up on six minutes gone by here in the first half Smith and thats his first points of the night 157 he just scores it in so many different ways I mean hes a threelevel scored hes really efficient at doing it again its the reason hes a third lead scorer in the ACC foreign points a game coming in for NC State all Slauson Way Long offensive rebound Furman good job there by pagies to track it down what do you want to see here offensively well when youre guarding this team they run a lot of prints theyre not a lot of cut without the boat theyre taking a lot of long range shots JP McGee I mean he is just hes the next one I think point guard Bob Richies been spoiled with great point guard play and he may be the next one and right back the other way is to clavian Smith so he counters with a three of his own and hes got five points hes explosive I mean he can score it in so many different ways and youre a State fan thats a great sign for him to hit two in a row were starting to heat up here right off yeah I mean he can do it from Deep he can do it off the bounce he creates his own shot hes one of those guys you just dont have to run plays for you just give him the ball and get out of his way see the numbers golf team scoring over 80 points a game this season see if were on our way to that here tonight rebound here by Alex Williams and a foul is called Alex Williams a big physical wing and when he comes in as you see attacks the offensive glass there its not a great threepoint shooting only shooting about 30 percent from behind the line but hes a big physical Wing hell post smaller guards and so what you want to see when youre coming from the bench make plays create office for yourself and he just did that ground to the glass Music and Saturday on the ACC Network and the ESPN app college basketball doubleheader starts at one got North Florida and Pittsburgh then Cornell with the 50mile drive up Route 11 to square up against Syracuse the orange have won the last 41 against the big red dating back to 1969 thats coming up on Saturday right here on the network Syracuse playing good basketball right now they struggled earlier right now they come up they won four in a row I mean four straight they want to know in the ACC winning on the road and Ill be calling that Cornell game so there you go and its a pretty good team that team took Miami down to 105 102 I think its a close game so should be a good game and Ill be there next week with Pitt and Syracuse that actually started the season one and three theyve won six of the last seven heres a three ball Marcel he does it again here Randolph thats his third already tonight hes got nine and a timeout Furman hey great shot third one since he stayed up early Music we love our new home theres so much space but we have ants expired its a lot of house keep it clean at least Geico makes bundling our home and car insurance easy for bundling Made Easy Go to geicocom Music solid start here for NC State Casey Marcel ran off he doesnt want to be the second best threepoint shoot in the ACC I think he wants to be the best yeah he is shooting the lights out man what an unbelievable start to the season for him I mean hes improved his jump shot so much I mean hes shooting nearly 50 percent its unbelievable to see what hes doing right now and hes on a tour place and doesnt look like hes trying to slow down at all first one in the gym works on his game heres Smith now good to see thats in and out rebound Thomas back out and Marcel another three thats way short but again its LJ Thomas in there for the offensive remap oh what a spin wow that would say Thomas putting this defender in a spin cycle early coming off the bench but theyre really acting defensively theyre really active turning them over and forcing quick shots and a block here by Smith on a threepoint Try by pagis great pass unable to finish that Thomas Ernest Ross I think he was surprised by the pass as much as I was Applause the geese Works inside Heen no good Thomas is in there again for the wolf pack Applause wolf pack just playing at the pace they want to play at turning them over quick shots getting to the rim here LJ Thomas just driving here trying to get defended a spin cycle off the glass 100 run by NC State up 15 early in first half Music okay Im an alien if youre making a

buttery delicious taste the love taste on the left for NC State doosan mahorsich dislocated his right patella two games ago versus common state hes out indefinitely hes talking to the Superstar about to come in Isam Miranda whats happening with that you know just giving him a taste of whats going on Miranda just getting on campus just enrolled in school I dont think hes been in class hes yet he hadnt done anything he just checked and its you know moved into the dorm so if youd love to see that from an experienced guy and boy should be back you know he I think hell be back sometime in February you need that type of leadership thats what you want from your older guys teaching younger guys kind of telling them how things will be almost nine points six and a half boards a game pretty much that same injury he had last year at Utah the transfer to Utah so The Graduate transfer mahorsich at 610 235 will be without his Services as you said for a while theyre optimistic he could return but then this Isaiah Miranda wow what a special talent eligible in just a couple days right yeah I mean hell start practicing soon hes quite not yet eligible to practice with his team but hes you know hes getting out there I think hell be able to I think tomorrow the day after and its its difficult what hes trying to do as well I mean joining a team at this level you know and and playing essentially coming in in ACC basketball without an off season its just incredibly difficult and does a player hunt firm and staff that can attempt to that you know Carter Witt has done that and thats just a difficult transition and and I cant understand that and I know hell be hes got a lot of Veteran presence and a lot of good players around him to help lean on him but hes hes a talented kid and hes up for the challenge its good timing here obviously with the injury to morich I mean they need you know some help there and theyre going to get him yeah its its going to be great its going to be great for him and he wont have tremendous amount of pressure he gets to physically you know learn hes going to have a lot going that thrown at him at one time what does it do right now to number 30 DJ Burns as you see a foul inside number 30 for NC State of what its like now for him in the increased minutes and hes got a play well hes playing he usually come off the bench he can give you like a change up I mean such a physical guy you get him inside and throwing a ball through post they originally I think the plan was just to press and go in the zone a lot more but Keishas more of a mantoman coach and now as you can see teams are going to attack him more to play a lot of minutes Sunday womens basketball quadruple header starts at noon Eastern weve got Wake Forest Syracuse were featuring these games Louisville and Pittsburgh at two and again Notre Dame in Virginia Tech and then Clemson and NC State running it out at 6 pm right here on the ACC Network and the ESPN app full day uh boots coming up on Sunday Notre Dame 81 lone loss to number 20 Maryland and Virginia Tech 100 number six ranked highest in program history Elizabeth kitley I sung her praise a year ago as Player of the Year and that has changed this year amen is she good Aboriginal lost 19 points a game and just over 11 rebounds fun player to watch hes coming up on Sunday its a 14point lead right now for NC State nine minutes into this first half good play defensively Inside by Furman but takeaway here they come and Carter Witt he got it stolen thats the one thing Carter has to done and Coach Richie just said he wanted him to take care of the basketball first possession turns it over and now Ernest Ross a little bit out of control of the crazy spin thats what happened at times to get to your bench you know guys come in and get a little bit out of control oh and watch the basketball right now kind of a hot potato there and gets caused with the offensive charge there Music Applause I thought he got away with one yeah hell travel there yeah we got eight points off turnovers for NC State here off the seven turnovers by Furman NC State now has three of Their Own NC States doing a great job theyre not overplaying you know farmer relies on aggressive defenses wants the back door you get some open looks you can tell NC States game plan is to keep everything in front and just contest jump shots well theyve been hard for us to stop JP McGee she hits another three ball hes got nine thats where his points have come from here tonight three of five from threepoint range JP McGees to say hey guys help me out I need some guys to help hes gotten off to a tremendous start again I think hes the next great point guard but Richies accustomed to just really good point guard playing JPs gonna be the next one Smith backing his way down on him no good rebound by Carter Witt takes it right to the hole himself and scores it the Wake Forest transfer Carter with the sophomore for two yeah and thats what you want to see push pushing the ball in transition keeping his head up he got deep playing off two feet to Keith and him not jumping in the air trying to make difficult pass that time he got deep laid it off he has that in this game and Randolph you know he wants to show something he didnt play in the last game first time all season but he was not in the game but hes got a difficult task on that end I mean guarding either one of these guards jaquel Jordan is as quick as they come so no embarrassment in that but again Carter wood has the talent so they just got to take care of the basketball on one end and sit down and guard him and Mike Richie believes in him he told us that before the game and you stole Carter wit you got to figure it out and and I think hell get every opportunity hes want to do this early hoping that hell turn things around in the second half of the season went with a foul how good is jointer been right I mean hes had a pretty special week 55 points over the last two games coming off that Pittsburgh game we talked about that he was really upset at himself about that and man did he respond uh hes hes playing lights out basketball right now and just he is the leader of this NC State team the Pittsburgh game back on December 2nd NC State lost 6860 yeah he had only one point and was over 12 from the field over seven from threepoint range you know has she has any semblance I mean thats an aberration its a cute assets they win that game heres a nice feed inside the Bothwell Bothwell finally gets himself in a scoring column but thats the basket that Thorne Furman wants to get in the half quartet they want to get those back door layups thats a big part of the offense until then State done a great job of keeping everything in front of him oh and a steal here picks up by Jalen Slawson in the midst of a 90 run right now for Furman they were down 2610 and they come right back into it here theres no quit in his team theres an advantage now I mean would you put put Burns and ball screens you could slaps and going and definitely getting this guy going Boswell a little strong with a nice box out by Jack Clark there as he got it tapped over to Joyner Joyner off balance wild one and its rebounded by Slauson yeah often tell coaches did some players like that jacquel joined the drones to the basket hit the ground its hard to match up your defense and get your defensive balance when point guard spend time on the ground how about these players for Furman Randall always coming down shot ready at that threepoint line right challenging now with a nice feed again inside of Bothwell hes passing ability I know coaches staffs upset right now got to be upset about that time off they talking about giving that big up footage for threepoint shots and taking away layups its great passes by him felt late Mike Bothwell with the back door cut its just a timing on it they do just such an unbelievable job but then the second one again big run here back in the game by Far Mill only down five gotta have some ball game here at PNC Center Geico has been offering savings for over 85 years thats longer than the buffalo wings been around lips are burning

the year and save on everything only at k foreign on the comeback Trail whats been happening here tonight made 100 running up 110 running just hes just done a heck of a job I mean hes a space force floor spacing big he shoots three to the top of the key but now theyre getting into that half court sets theyre theyre getting the back door cuts the state did a great job of denying early on and now theyre getting threes or just get a mixture of everything and now they also turning this he stayed over like this they are five turnovers now for NC State a three ball here by peguese NC State possession the geese has already hit three threes tonight hes now three of six on the outside and what a game of runs that weve had here yeah it was really NC State with the first two big ones of this game yeah they started out with a 100 run early then at 110 run to get up by 15 and since then firm has closed off with 110 run Clark for three thats Jack Clark transfer out of LaSalle and he knocks it down hes got five for him to get going as well I mean he struggled from behind a threepoint line early went swings it right back to Slauson was wide open for three and thats off the back rim Keane was battling Ford instead NC State and Marcel and its going to be Joyner to bring it up as long as DJ Burns is under the defensive end theyre going to get that shot on a pick ball screen picking pop all night long its just up to slaw something and knock it down Smith long three Applause I think those are the shots that Smith can do just a little bit of time such an explosive score and he gets it easy but those are the shots that youd like to see just get a little bit more off inside of sure be a little bit better high percentage shot could probably get that one at any time yeah you can take that anytime in the game and the teams in a you know a little bit of run now you want you dont want to keep the Run going by taking shots like that thats wet Carter Wick comes in shot fate gets to a spot okay thats four points for him I mean again anything production coming off the bench hes a confident kid these kids played in this league before hes playing this gym before so dont expect any back down from him six point game here first half coming up on six minutes remaining Smith trying to feed it inside to Burns again sometimes its better to be lucky than good just a heck of a deflection there and then he just continues to play and thats what score is do the ball just finds you when you such a natural story like he is seven points for him Slauson fakes on the three gets by Burns gonna call Burns for the foul thatll be his first of the night Applause being tried to a little onehand pass and remembers lost his defensive player he hit but he tells him not so fast Im getting that back push that in the bucket how about the knowledge that Smith got when he put himself in for the NBA you know to get the information right you know for hey what am I going to be like here can I get to the next level they said you got to be able to try to create a little bit more for others right right well hes certainly doing that this season if you look at some of the numbers right 67 assists last year here it is 61 so far this season I mean its just an added piece I think not everybody takes that information in a positive manner sometimes kids come back and they try to overdo things you know its its always great to be unselfish oh hes going to assist tonight its a 62 on the season now he gets a steal and Joyner does anyhow Here Comes Joyner whats that blocking foul heres Brian OConnell as that was Penn Van Der Waal who tried to take the charge to freshman for Furman I think vanderwaal was in the No Charge Zone area I think he probably had his feet underneath the rim got to go vertical when youre there you cant just you know if youre inside that that Circle there you gotta you can go vertical in this contact but you cant have your feet planted itll be an automatic block every time like that was this is what I talked to jacquel joined about today when you want to get yourself going get to the free throw line and I know for him its just a your score like he is getting yourself some free throw line is a big deal its got him retreating like that gets up under him yeah yeah great call great job by joining just youre backing up that way offensively you just gotta attack a guy hes kind of guessing what directions gonna go at that speed its just difficult thing to get in front of the ball one of the verbal leaders of this team mature player kind of can put the weight on his shoulders hes always talking to the guys all the time helps lead some of the workouts hes the leader of this guy and hes every team needs a guy like that hes essentially a coach on the floor works hard in the gym constantly look at that someone knocks it away boxwell recovers trying to force it to the corner its intercepted by his backcourt made Smith and Joyner tracks it down Applause oh this is where is he stayed in a half court set what are you going to do now you dont their ball screen motion team Music this kicks it Joiner for three and a foul on the rebound as it was called in by Ebenezer dewana Tawana is going to come in and you know hes the one thats going to benefit from the injury early hes got to come out and its not going to give you the offensive production but he can scream he can roll to the basket and he can also go to the offensive glass which he did there is rewarded for that by getting to the free throw call me b Junior from Ghana credit to him just being a team player didnt play much didnt play at all early and then now hes kind of hes writing a rotation hes a guy that was a starter in the past and credit to him for just keeping himself mentally ready one and one thats the front half this is ninth game of the season average is only about three minutes a game but yeah starting to get more into the max its great when you keep yourself ready to go Slawson steps into a three and hes been a little off from the outside tonight and that ball is knocked out of bounds off of Thomas of NC State it was difficult for NC State to switch that unless they put a lineup out there and I think they will at times and theyll switch off five that shot will be there all night so theres no reason to rush and guardings Lawson you got to leave them out there until he makes a cover before you run out there or go for the shot well yeah I mean I mean hes still looking for his first points ran off hes over three from the field he averages 15 and a half and eight he does I mean hes all conf so Comfort I mean first team were in hes a heck of a player I mean he does it on both ends so hes a guy that spends a ton of energy on the defensive end as well but hes more comfortable facing the basket and driving than he is shot behind the yard hes now seven of 26 from threepoint range on the season so good point that you made there heres a foul called as Bothwell tucking in I think so great Gantt there just didnt keep the ball in front and great job getting in front bottwell getting to that left hand and getting the angle and drawing the foul pathway got off to a slow start but you know its amazing what you can do when youre struggling from the field getting getting yourself to the to the free throw line here Bothwell averages a team best 203 points a game thats the 12 combination there with Slauson hes got four so far here tonight arguably the best player in the socon Music Applause and hell stay at Four Points the annual ACC huddle preview special tomorrow at six oclock right here on the ACC Network on the ESPN app joining Corner Eric McLean DJ Manuel Mark Rick theyll take a look at the nine ACC teams playing in a

noon East stood on ESPN Joyner got it thats such a difficult shot driving to his left and another quick turn over here on the steal block from behind by Slawson but NC State with Gantt gets it back and Joyner lost it vanderwaal throws it away the Hot Potato nobody wants yeah but I mean they play Up Tempo right I mean youre gonna I guess you got to kind of live with some of this you have to draw back a plane LJ Thomas scores it four for him 3724 all of a sudden wolf pack has it back up to 13 now to Wolf Pack lines on the floor now wants to switch everything so this is where Slauson needs to get inside the post and do damage to the post great job didnt see the double team coming what a clamp down they take it away from Slauson 12 turnovers now in the night speaking of which goes right back to Bothwell oh theres slausons first points they want to run off turnovers thats what they want to do great pass and assist there by the two First Team all Socom players its seven turnovers for NC State now at three from Smith the best offensive weapon of all and just say hey go get me a bucket time out here coaches want to settle both teams down Music Mark will coming down notice in his

him as many buckets as he gave me on the other sideline man was he a tough cover just an unbelievable player 2014 ACC Player of the Year and having a great NBA career in his ninth year coming back to support as well okay always great to see that I know theyre happy to have one of their alums back in the building such a great one how about a couple players here in this one that have the potential for the next level as well been scoring this from the jump I mean 10 quick points for him in two Steals and Bothwell started out slowly hes picked it up with five points and two assists and two steals himself in the last couple of minutes here all right whats firmer going to do here theyre down by 14 been in danger zone a couple of times tonight got to keep running their stuff theyre gonna get looks they just got to take one thing and stop turning the basketball over theyre getting good like that thats the problem well you said it and Smith capitalizes you dont want that guy coming at you with numbers Advanced you just dont know what hes going to do you dont want to give a guy like a scorer like him easy buckets like that but again another 13th turnover for Furman already this first half Applause they average winning games 127 a game yeah so theyre already over that here in the first half Music Pace that NC State wants to play just more of a ragtag up and down because pressure affects you in multiple ways if youre not turning it over and taking quick shots if you were to add the quick shots the firm is taking then those turnovers might be 15 or 16 or 17 already we got eight turnovers on the other side for NC State but they have a 16 point lead here as we come up in a minute and a half to play Bothwell hean no Bothwell no yeah and how good has LJ Thomas been tonight numbers watch ahead Smith he grabbed it he gathered himself on that one I thought it was thought he was going to catch and finish him but again great look great pass by two of the two back court mates there this is the largest lead of the night for NC State foster for three big one he needed it its a quick shot but again Foster made at that time again its just its just part of their offense and you dont have to rush you got plenty of time to get back in the game but again I think thats again defensively is where NC State is effective firmer right now when theyre not turning it over force them into one pass and a quick shot well in Foster is finally in the scoring column thats his first bucket of the night after being over five from the field here is Thomas for three got it got the bounce got the shooters touched there got the corner three great pass by Burns and hes done a really good job of catching into that mid posting up rolling in the short posted off the ball screen and perspiring it to the weak side seven points three rebounds couple steals for Thomas in just nine minutes of action so far here in the first half very productive 10 seconds left Music another takeaway Joyner and hell head to the freethrow line with 21 seconds left great job there I know joining wanted to finish that off great steal pushing it in cutting off the angle drawing a foul on Foster what an end to this first half here for NC State it hit five of the last five from the field of foul on Foster his second for Furman foreign ER who has a chance to push this lead up to 20 before the break Joyner has a shot at great hes only won a four from the field but again hes attempting his sixth free throw and just great job by him getting himself oh look at this almost a tip in by Smith at the end of the first half so well back himself for a 19 point lead how about that big half by state 14 turnover the first half thats been a theme of the day but playing the game at their Pace gotta be happy with that really impressed well talk way even Smith just doing what he does just a buck sometimes but if you get this group at you turning it over and get everyone involved in the transitioning you gotta you got a difficult task ahead now Furman can get on a run they did in the first half they went on an 110 run however it was a 16point lead by NC State at the time so they got back within five you know thats its its a lot here but you know they can they can get on a run they got to get solid on the defensive end as heres a foul as Marcel takes it in and begin the second half I think its a conscientious effort by NC State to get more sale going I mean he got he hit shots early in the first half and now they come out running first plate for him in the second half and he draws the foul and caught a wit but for Furman to get back into this game they want to play at a pace but theres a different style State wants to play 94 feet Furman will run off turnovers but they want to play good Pace in their half court movement in their sets and theyre going to need a center they aint gonna need Keen or theyre going to need slots in the knock down threes Burns is not coming out to the threepoint line and theyre going to put him in ball screens to try to get things going but got to do it on the defensive end if they want to make a run and then just 23 lead third fouls on wet as you said its now a 21 point lead for NC State you mentioned Slauson as well too hes just got the two points one of four from the field he does have five rebounds theres wet get to the Slawson NC State picked up full court pressure there trying to deliver a knockout below here theyre up 20 but when it breaks down theyre going to put Burns and ballswings went five to shoot peguese Applause Music tough one over Marcel hes got it and up to Smith Elliot time oh and a block coming back Slauson chase down block not giving up on the play block Joyner and right back the other way is wet so solid defensive play that turns into a two for Furman thats the second time Schloss has done that I mean just those are big possessions you got numbers and those are four point swings hes done that twice tonight again its the price Player of the Year in Socom I mean just a tremendous effort by him just over a minute into the second half Marcel good luck for another three hes feeling it tonight that looked good when it left his hands he shot it right at an angle Im looking at the basket it never left the middle of the basket just guys in the Rhythm I mean its just its what hes doing right now hes so confident looks good when he leaves his hand you know he believes its going in when he shoots it we had the perfect view from behind right as you saw it yeah hes four six and threepoint range tonight play he just made before that on the defensive end its just great I think he has Defensive Player of the Year capability he guards the best perimeter guy on the other team and when you combine that three indeed the way hes shooting the basketball if you got yourself a heck of a player and hes actually on Pace right now for 50 40 90 type of season its just not easy to do falazon Joyner his second for NC State and Furman gets it into Heen whos got six Music Smith gets double team finds Burns wow this great robot Burns catching it great pass by to Craven Smith yeah I mean thats his recognition right you know he didnt have it he got double team now hes running the break and gets it into another turnover another transition basket the theme of the day here for Furman they just turned the basketball over its a credit to NC State this is the way they want to play well and coming off that game at Miami its a very tough Miami team lost 80 to 73 you know you knew theyd be ready for this and theyve come out strong just an explosive score I think hes as greatest score as there is in this conference right now hes just hes in a rhythm right now heck of a player Smith and Marcel both have 17 and its a 27 point lead for the Wolfpack with the awardwinning Geico mobile app our customers joined the call hey Bill were just here uh do we have Julian too okay sorry okay um the

packages terms apply Music if you do what feels right then own your style Phillips oneblade your style Made Simple theres always a way to make life better its been a 124 run to start the second half for NC State and Bob Ritchie and Furman here in the home of the wolf pack and also the Carolina Hurricanes of the NHL and hes done almost a line change here hes got the only starter in Marcus Foster number four Ben vanderwaal is in number 12 Johnny Lawrence number 15 Tyrese Huey and number 24 Alex Williams all from Off the Bench see if that can spark the paladins here are you sending a message to his team I mean he got seven turnovers out of his twopoint guards combined and his two best players have six so thats 13 of their 15 turnovers hes sending the Massachusetts group right now anybody can play if you take care of the basketball and they have not been able to do that to a wide open Smith got that with the left hand yeah just a lot of over dribbling and thats not the way Furman tends to play I think thats whats getting them in trouble theyre turning it back on the defense and again credit to NC State theyve got enough they pressured the ball they use their athleticism their speed their Limb and its bought it for me that was Alex Williams who scored and hes just trying to get back into the mix a little bit too I mean he doesnt miss the first six games of the team rules violation so its only his fifth game of the season hes only averaged about eight minutes a game so they need his services you get down in games like this and you tend to think its over but its incredibly important you cant tell that guy the games over because as long as theres time on the score hes looking to get a bucket thats 20 for him tonight it doesnt matter shot clock is winding down now Williams comes back with a three of his own I mean hes just a gift to score it just comes easy to him key for him is just taking good shots because you got to guard him in the parking lot this matchup isnt going to work again just missed thats a difficult matchup now a three ball from Huey thats well off and into the hands of Joyner hes got Smith in the corner good rotation more cell there is hes been real money from that shot here tonight hes 47 now from threepoint rain Smith is four of six Music Ive said hes AC early ACC Player of the Year candidate but Chuck wavy and Smith just giving it to you how you want getting out on the break finishing ducking that with the left just a heck of a performance on fire with his range NC State up 27 in the PNC Center Music go now okay

oneblade your style Made Simple theres always a way to make life better furmans going to be challenging in the selfcon they almost got to the NCAA tournament last year suck on championship game you were there Randolph you called it one of the best games Ive seen all year I think it was the best game of champ week I mean just a buzzer beater there I think I lost my voice for maybe three days after that game I mean an unbelievable game intensity those guys played with but I was just so disappointed and hurt for firm and they were just so deserving of getting there but its a onebit league and whoever wins it gets to the tournament and Tennessee Chattanooga won it last year and Farm is the preseason number one team in socon to win it this year its a goal 10 you know and Bob Ritchie whos been with this program now for 12 years six citizen assistant six is the head coach 22 wins last year they went back to back 25 win seasons in 2019 and 2020 and you know four straight 20 plus win seasons for the first time in school history I mean they got this thing on the rise a credit to him and the man that he is and the coach that he is because I can assure you Mike Boswell had hit options last year had he went to portal you know Jaden Slawson had options had he gone in a quarter and when you keep those players particularly at a mid major program things are going to go well for you and youre going to win games and thats the point we have to make with this Furman team High academic institution and Coach Richie has prided himself in a staff of the development yes the retention right the players building a team and kind of doing it the right way with sustainability hes only got one transfer on the team and thats Carter Whitt from Wake Forest as you said a preseason favorite uh the last second shot away from being in the NCAA tournament last year and a chance to go there again this year and youre adding that a transfer from a high academic institution like Wake Forest and so hes winning and I think theyll be right there theyre the first place team in Socom and I believe theyll theyll finish it out this year hes just a heck of a coach and we all know what the coaches from that League have done in the past they are attending a more cell over on the sideline as you saw there for NC State left leg Im trying to shake it off lets hope hes all right well see if he gets back in but of course 25point lead here Smith bombing up another three another offensive rebound and thats in and out this time from Breon pass Korean pass is the sophomore guard there do they expect the big things out of him I mean to making that big jump and that freshman sophomore year to jump from to bring on pass now defending to post tough match of their retirees Huey you know and pass whos really best friends with turquadian Smith they came in together and passed actually a fourstar football recruit coming out of high school he was a football player chose one to play basketball and to come here to NC State hes been practicing really well I think theyre really high on him just give him some time you know no rush its hard to find the Rhythm with guys and hes playing with two Dynamic guards and then LJ Thomas kind of comes in and hes kind of that other guard kind of getting in there right now so its just difficult to find your path with so many good players but hes coaching staff is high on them and youre in a good system here right under here coach Kevin Keats who wants to play a lot of guys because youre going to run out there youre going to go after teams and hes going to go sometimes nine and ten deep hes going to let you play just ask our Craven Smith hes going to let you get out there and take shots okay Saturday coming up to the ACC Network and the ESPN college basketball doubleheader we got Pat hosting North Florida and Syracuse and Cornell thats a three all right here on the network and on the ESPN app 21 points now Music you need to allow him to do what he does great job from the bench now they get some life out of invention just a statement about Coach Richie there just sitting his start as another guy so starting to implement them back into the game and he wants to see it run here by his group heres pass for three thats no good and on the run is Foster after knocking down the three ball and now NC State settle for some quick threes on this and not running a lot of offense and you get up big the tendency is to relax a little bit got to keep your foot on the gas a little bit here and continue to pressure the ball continue to take open looks and playing it could seem like firm and theres no shot block on the floor youd like to see them more attacking from the pink before they start shooting threepoint shots Music cant doing a really good job of old playing Bothwell back to Foster as Thomas is all over him he puts up the three anyhow and skying for the rebound Ernest Ross this great defensive possession there by state allowing him to get out and run pass takes it in that layup happened because of the great defense keeping the ball in front pressure the basketball three ball Healy Applause foul going the other way its on Furman what about for the rest of the ACC here this season middle of November what do we got yeah you know the big story line I I think Miamis continue to roll I think Virginia Tech surprised a lot of peoples expected freshman of Duke I called that game and they started five freshmen thats the first time any great freshmen they had they started five and I dont think the sky is falling in North Carolina I think they got it off to a slow start I think theyll fix that over this fall break and Christmas break and I think youll see that team called the resemble what we saw second half of last year yeah I mean how could he be worried about yeah right now right I mean they werent even thought about it right last year and then they go play for the title and then you know now all the pressures on right yeah theyre like whoa whats wrong like victim of their own success that time those guys will figure it out I think the bigger question for the ACC is whos going to be the team to take the next step and surprise people and be the Wake Forest of last year this current season Thomas scores it might be looking at one right here tonight dont you think I think so I think if NC State defends at this level and as they get bodies and get healthy they could be a team to take that jump Im really impressed with them on the defensive end Applause Music theyre continuing to guard I mean this has to be a staplewood Music vanderwaal count the basket chance for the threepoint play when we come back but its NC State by 25 here at home tonight well on their way to their ninth win of the season

up every day to help me walk again and now Im back this is a reminder that lavender as well express your extraordinary love so you got to go way back it was former NC state coach Edward case credited with starting the nut nut cutting tradition net cutting tradition in college basketball he did it first after winning the socom Championship back in 1947 you know and how about some of the socon championship winning coaches and where they are today just accredited his League I mean you saw Mike young its not a better coaching college basketball than Mike Young and the job that Steve force is going down at Wake Forest and Wes Miller and LaMont Paris and Bob Ritchie will be the next one I believe after this season and just a credit to this that league and the coaching at that league and I think a lot of athletes figured that out too when they get down there they think its just a lot easier and and I use Carter with as an example kind of transfers from the ACC down to that league and youre not starting right away you got to figure it out you get down and realize theres players and that league is tough and and and you see by the power five coaches that come from that League how well respected that league is and its great coaching the net cunning tradition not to be confused with the nut cutting tradition as I was trying to say whatever the heck I was trying to say yeah and I just watched the survive in advance again the other night you know which was just awesome and you know we just had Jimmy V week here on ESPN and uh there was one practice you know that coach V said every year that he just said one practice where all we did was practice cutting the Nets down you know and I just thought of its unbelievable because obviously they want it and you just got it in your players Minds like this is what were gonna do we got to practice doing what you want to achieve and they did it I just love that story and everything that that 1983 team did I mean you go back and youre talking about even Lynn Elmore text me the other day and got on me to remind you because someone talked about how good the league was back during the time that I played and he said hey you know it was still a one big lead back when I first started so it just gives you a tremendous amount of respect of how far Collegiate Athletics has come and how difficult it was because when youre in a power five conference you dont think of it as as a onebit league right back in those days it was right thats thats crazy Music top pass inside swung back out to Bothwell bombs up a three no good rebound peguese as many of the starters are back in Bothwell again off the back iron joyners got it two good looks you cant complain about that from your lead score man Jordan lost his footing there and he got inside and youd like for him again and kind of settle down and play off two feet off got a chance to talk to him at shooting around today hes just a special special person so well deserving of the success love to hear the story about him and his dad and how close they are as well got the basket in the foul Bothwell theyre quitting his team Bothwell getting out of Lane hes a big physical guard hes the 20point game score for a reason get to the paint uses that strong body and finishes with the right hand its a tough late for a left Thomas with a foul Applause great minutes from NC State LJ Thomas I mean double figures from the bench hes got four steals I mean just keeps talking to both these young guys Music theyre going to be a big part of NC State basketball going forward youre gonna need those guys going through the rest of the year he mentioned the D here for state and thats been the story give him a ton of credit because bothwells got only eight points he averages 20 right and then how about Sloss it is the story NC State Defense like this they can beat anybody in the ACC theyre going to score they play a style they give their guys Freedom Peach wants his guys defending hell let you play on the offensive end and hell dial you back and start taking you know if you take a bad shot or two but he lets his guys play on the offensive but he wants to defend him Slauson the second leading scorer for Furman with 15 and a half the game hes got only two their lengthen athleticism has bothered him some and having to touch with Burns inside trouble Slawson he wants to handle got it back theres three seconds to shoot now in the corner its Huey and he hits a three Applause dont give up there great job by Slaughter to recover from that all right 20point game here uh Casey Marcel back in with 14 for NC State were shaking up a little bit earlier and that left leg looks to be okay here Music you got to play you cant just come down and youre not forcing turnover this is the next step for this team and heres Marcel lets get the bounce gotta get the mouse with a good shot penetration kick to the corner three I feel like that execution there but they got to do a better job of taking the next step of executing in the half inside and Furman scores it vanderwaal and a timeout Kevin Keats in NC State their lead is down to 18 still plenty of time left in this game to play time out 914 remaining wolf pack still in command were back in 30 seconds Music Geico has been offering savings for over 85 years thats longer than the buffalo wings been around her lips are burning Geico over 85 years of savings and service its bow time some folks say dont call it a comeback but when the sizzling Savory pork chop grillers back for a limited time in all its tender marinated Glory go ahead call it a comeback its boat today nothing run here for firm and NC State still leads it by 18 you mentioned joyners father Stacy and how important hes been he told us today hes his role model hes his best friend sends him motivational text every day they talk every day all the time his father owns a barber shop he said hes one of the hardest workers he knows gets up four or five in the morning gets in the business and I know hes so proud of what jarkel Joyner has done throughout his career what a great relationship those two have its special you know you love to see it when he talked about it you can tell theres nothing his eyes light up theres nothing better than a young man talking about how proud he is of his father and credit to Stacy you know thats Admiral join us guys like that he swings at the Clark who takes it in and Jack Clark scores it remember watching Clark for many years at LaSalle and hes found a nice home here at NC State he fits with Carolina I mean with NC State does I mean they just its that six eight Wing that can stretch the defense ball scales guard the ball just a seamless transition for him well he doesnt have to do it all right I mean he was kind of one of their main guys here its like hey you can step it down a little well take your eight to ten points a game and good team basketball well I think its freed everyone ever when you embrace the role I think thats why Casey Marcel numbers are through the roof because you got those two guys you got Jack Hill Jordan you got taquavius Smith theres such lethal offensive player theyre making a game East for everyone else so just do your part accept your role and this team could be successful three ball so up and in by Slawson he has not had the night hes wanted hes only got five points his first made three of the night its a 17point game hang on here eight minutes remaining and Furman gets a steal we talked about the half court offense there so hard when you get up there to continue that intensity thats the next step for this club and theres no quitting his firmative theyre going to continue to play Slauson goes to work and couldnt get the little Runner there Clark the other way finishes in a foul that is big that really puts the hurt back on the other way and has a chance to push this back up to 20 great effort by NC State continue to turn up the pressure another hand won by Clark NC State still up 19 early Music lets be real your ears are gross yeah you heard me right and let me guess youre cleaning them with these you need to be using whoosh trust me

emergency analysis Kevin Keats in the wolf pack this is what they do right Force turnovers nice job here 17 tonight I mean hes a big part of the offense they wanted to get back into doing that I mean they if they have an Achilles heels theyre struggling to have court theyve theyve even worked on that tonight but again scored 19 points off turnovers which is the biggest difference in the game I mean the average you know nine steals a game and they got 15 tonight and that leads the league and thats their recipe for Success they want to continue to do that done a great job of that tonight the reason theyve got this big lead converted them into points season high is 17 steals in a game this year the school record is 20 yeah and you see the number there 50 when 1415 or more turnovers so once again the case tonight 17 for Furman their season high in turnovers for Furman is 20 versus South Carolina state so thats the second most theyve had all season in this game here we still have 7 33 to go tough cover when you do that with this type of length and size and athleticism playing in a team like NC State and they want to play in that game and when you factor in not just the the turnovers just the quick shots that youre taking the geese is fouled by taquavian Smith thats his second of the night and youve said this before too and how deep NC State goes and how much they play as a team seven players Randolph have a steal in this game tonight well theyre doing it on the defensive end is what you want thats a big a big factor for this team because we know what his shots are going to come from look at this another one Ross Applause and this is the way NC State plays theyre going to get still try to get threes up in transition so Music now eight players have a steal as Ross got that last one so eight different players are still tonight for NC state farming back the other way bucking inside Huey foreign down 18 almost a steal state does a great job breaking the press and then getting out Applause Slauson guarding Smith I think theyre just going to run an ISO form Smith Powers his way in a little short and then he climbs over the top of Slauson thats what Smith is all right so you hit the deck hard I think hell be fine catches off balance there chases it yeah he braces himself his hands hit the ground first I dont think he hit it harder hes probably a little more tired than anything I mean 24 points right now hes playing really good basketball 245 I mean well the lead was up to 30 thats the thing and Furman and Ross for the rejection and its gonna be wolf pack possession I think he knocked it off the geese after the Block its a great play good call Furman had that 11nothing run earlier tonight but it was a 16 point lead at the time for NC State today cut it to five and the lead ballooned all the way up to 30 at 6535 Wolf Pack and now heres a basket and a foul for darkell Joyner counted just a quick ball screen Ross runs up and again jacquel is so quick just change his speed so well open your hip up expecting the ball screen doesnt come he slipped out early and he just goes I mean so much of their offense is just guarding Jacques jaquel Joyner and aquavian Smith oneonone I mean you got to give those guys so much attention and you got to rotate Health to help those guys for 10 points tonight falazon Huey his second for Furman the leads up to 21 you dont have a lot of time if you throw him in a run your typical offensive set so you got to get him up quick like this how about three pointers here tonight now eight of 27 29 and on the other end the three goes in for Jack Clark its great signed by him I mean just runs the lane hard flattens out the defense gets it and knocks down a corner three Jack Clarks got 13 points in this game here slowly climbing up and 1228 are the wolf pack from threepoint range at 43 percent in this one yeah theyre getting good looks and theyre finding them in transition theyre really aggressive in transition off those you find players and double figures here tonight just a wellbalanced attack team again we know the two guys but theyre gonna get boundless guys when theyre defending the ball moves guys are going to score and I think thats what Peach is trying to get guys to buy into just defend at a high level let the ball find you on the offensive end Smith leads all scorers tonight with 24 yes Lawson gets it inside hounded for the moment we have Bothwell telling everyone to clear out and he takes it in and gets fouled by dewana what about with Burns right hes only played well hes played 17 minutes tonight the big guy for NC State you know now hes getting a little rest do you like that what do you got here well thats usually what he does he plays 20 minutes and before they wanted his 20 minutes to come off the bench but now with the injury you know the military hes forced to start and so he just gets the same you know 18 to 20 minutes hes just getting him at the start of the first half the second half Sunday womens basketball quadruple header starts at noon Eastern at noon its Wake Forest in Syracuse and then weve got Louisville and Pittsburgh at two followed by number five Notre Dame number six Virginia Tech its gonna be a fun one and at six oclock its Clemson and NC State all right here on the ACC Network and the ESPN app weve got a 22 point lead here for the wolf back with five minutes to go in this contest NC State averages 81 points a game they already have 85 Joyner as you say its a difficult team to press as well because they got so many handlers one through four theyre all going to initiate offense theyre still flying around defensively geese Music Larson Music no good on the three Solid box out by Marcel and he got taken away Applause Ill sudden hes fouled by more so surprise Slawson making a good defensive play hes just doing what he does credit to him no quitting him down 22 hes going to continue to play as long as in the game still a lot to learn early in this year youre learning about yourself youre learning about your team Applause they want chicken I guess they missed the two free throws during the second half Applause chicken I want some chicken too yeah I want to ChickfilA Sandwich yeah tell them guys it could be my dinner tonight its like you dont need that too youre down 22 or 21 I said he had to score that wouldnt matter I wouldnt mind a chicken sandwich as well student section behind us Applause theres foul here and were going the other way to shoot free throws lets talk this NC State team here right

was just difficult for everyone right well and then lets think about all the changes now transfers and the NFL we can talk about that forever but its just lets add all that into the next right I mean

Leagues in a good place right now theres some big wins I mean you even talk about Wake Forest and wins Over Georgia and Pitt coming in here getting a win and she stayed I think is a team right there and Miami is just tremendous and I think Carolinas going to respond theyre going to get back so the league is in a good place and Virginia Tech Duke and Virginia as good as any team in the country right now so a lot to be determined as we get into that conference play starting in the next couple of weeks with this new you know metric if you will on the evaluation of teams come time for the NCAA tournament it makes it so important for you to take care of business in the November and December games prior to that remember how it wasnt such a big deal oh this is the nonconference were getting ready for conference no you have to win these games and then you gotta hope the teams that you win or even potentially lose against have good Seasons yes so it helps your overall resume of where they finish you know to help your ranking it has to be part of your schedule right now you have to understand the and knowing where you are on your program when youre just getting started and hey you can kind of try to play Easier games but when you establish yourself and you have postseason Ambitions you have to play play good teams I mean even if youre going to play a mid major team you got to play a team like this I believe this team fermenting will be an NCAA team I think theyll win the Southern Conference they are a favorite to do it I think you dont judge them by the night this will be a good win its a good point weve seen some amazing fans across the ACC and now we need your help this winter ACC Network wants to experience each sport from your perspective so snap a pic take a video tag it with a hashtag all the devotion and post it to your social you just might see it on the ACC Network and thats it I mean if youre NC State You Come Away with a big convincing win here tonight to your point to go up against the team that may win their conference and go to the NCAA tournament thats going to be huge and NC State have lost their two ACC game so far this year so they need to find a way to get back on winning track continue to get back at playing basketball the way that they want to play for some turnovers and making threes and theyve done both of those games tonight he knocked down the threepointer there for Furman and the assist from the geese one of the emotional leaders for this team has a lot of fun out there they try to say get a little bit stronger I mean six nine hes 215 and then you know he can even be really super dangerous I did before and last year had 17 versus Louisville hes a big factor for this team this season what we saw earlier from him is his ability to pass from the top of the key I think the one thing hes going to have to do is start shooting the ball I mean he shoots at a good percentage from three he just doesnt take enough and I think hes gonna have to look to take more shots if they go forward and get ready for conference but state by 17 thanks a large part to this guy tonight just a bucket I mean hes just good he is he scored today all three levels you know however you want it Runners get to the passing Lane we talked about him being second in the ACC still trying to defense in the offense and heads unlimited range and shes just quick off the down like that its a tough cover and uh you want to make it challengful when youre guarding a guy like that you just want to say hey hes going to get his number I just want to make him shoot a four percentage right now tonight hes shooting the ball well and shooting just right above 50 so 43 points now in the last two games for to quavion Smith and thats awesome he got five more tonight and yep play making ability is just something thats been added to his game and for sure enjoy him while you can folks uh youre on the clock I dont think hell come back next year right correct 66 assists but 67 all of last year yeah hes definitely added to his game you know what thats some credit to him and the credit to the staff you know I know teaches adjusted his staff this year with Kareem Richardson whos with him at Louisville and you know Levi Watkins went to my Flint Hill High School together and Joe Justice over there was my ball boy that makes me feel so old he was my ball boy at Wake Forest are you kidding me I saw you talking to him earlier yeah hes just unbelievable guy so proud of him he had his unbelievable his family his father was the Sid for me at Wake Forest thats great dont you just love though how the network kind of grows especially in this game I mean I love college basketball right I mean you know you played a tremendous player ever had a several there to Wake Forest and then you know he played professionally NBA overseas your coach right back in the rainforce all the people that youve known and learned and you know been with over the years and that thats everybody right well its just a reminder of why you ultimately do it just the relationship that you establish even from your time when you attend school in college and then if youre fortunate enough to work around and then Colleen Athletics nothing about those relationships and and mentorships you established we saw these young athletes foul on the way in was pegis alongside Randolph Childress tonight Mike Corey with you John Madrids doing a great job with us for stats good to see you again my friend what a great job by our crew here and NC State our producer Josh monk

and helping with us here tonight trip Culbreth and Tim West Music 8770 NC State by 17 it is two minutes 2 minutes 29 seconds to go on this one try to go to 93 on the season you look at some of the losses right you got the sixpoint loss to Kansas no problem there you had hit an eightpoint loss but thats you know what Joyner going over 12 in the field at one point that doesnt seem like thats going to happen again you wouldnt think and then Miami a seven point loss on the road at a very very good Miami team so uh theyre all right here you know 95 we have for tonight theyre fine theyre in a good place particularly tonight to respond the way they did and and played the way coach Keach wants them to play and thats pressure on the basketball fourth turnovers knock down threes you know its just uh I think he feels comfortable with his crew heading into finals and looking forward to getting healthy bodies back and even attic bodies with Isaiah Miranda coming in and seeing how far this team can go this team is set up they got to dig themselves out of an 02 hole but I think theyll do so dewanas at the free throw line here double bonus time for NC State a little bit can you talk about what uh Bob Ritchie the sides done for Furman and the development of players and you know Kevin Keats is got to be one of the best at that right and when he was at Hargrave and all the players said he had a mentor to get up to the next level and what he knows they need to do to improve their game I mean such a great teacher over there and we could see him with a little path both of these teams are well coached teams I I think Bob Richie would be a hot major coach sometime next year however you dont think itll matter whether he wins its so kind or not I think hes a really good young coach and just watch his team play youll be really impressed and Im just its fun to watch I mean just to keep those guys I cant but this the Nils and all the transfer portal things thats going on right now for him to keep his two best players that I know High major teams would have would have want its just a credit to him Applause I mean who wouldnt I had a 63 physically gifted Lefty that gives you the defense that gives you 20 a night with Mike Bothwell and being able to retain him is just a fun player not a great night tonight yeah its fun to watch and hell respond passive made the previous jumper for NC State to put him up to 90 points so now Bothwell here after the Miss its a 19point lead Center two minutes to go Applause Music Its just tough to press theres too many handles on this team I mean at any given time theyre going to have four guys on the floor that can just a great defensive Play Again by Slauson its just so fun to watch him play he he really competes on this end of the floor and theres not a lot of guys take pride on that as much as he does and pretty sure hes going to be an early candidate for repeat his socalled Defensive Player of the Year first team selection and hes had a triple double before in his career and you know last game 25 points 19 in the second half definitely a Player of the Year spark to follow it up and end Applause 15 for him Applause now NC state scored 107 theres this FIU back on November 15th thats crazy also 94 in the winter verse common state and 92 here tonight a great job by state just rattling into the basketball all night helping each other pressuring the ball speeding this firming team up and they also 99 in game one versus Austin Peay so points are not a problem for the soft pack team theyre going to empty the bench with 591 remaining nice Ovation for the fans here at PNC Arena that should always be a goal of the scholarship athlete you know those guys these WalkOns practice just as hard to do everything weight room running all the conditioning that you do and supposed to be a goal of yours to get these guys out on the floor to get them in a stat book so lets see who can get a rebound who can get it says who can score so they can officially be in the books to your point I mean and people say yeah yeah but no it goes without saying they got to run the Scout you know for the other team they got to put a good scout out there make sure theyre in the right position theyre running the place to show your starters what youre going to be looking at well most of those guys they know all of your offense and they know the other teams yeah Music Applause impressive coach coach has his son out there right there get the score books come on KJ give it to him again threepointer its off the mark Thats on by Chase Graham and Foster lays it in for Furman talked to Coach Petes about that as well its a nothing better than coaching just signed no matter what and him being there with you when you trial and
