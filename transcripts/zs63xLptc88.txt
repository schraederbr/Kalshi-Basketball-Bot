afternoon from JBJ The 7 foot4 Matt Van Coleman the sevenfooter Johan Grunlow in the center circle Cavs win the tipper underway Were going to look to see this Virginia offense try to get started early get these points up on the board get a couple of rotations Yeah the Cavaliers have just been scorching hot offensively to begin this season averaging just over 86 points per game and theyve made 11 threes per game thus far Here is Sam Lewis the transfer from Toledo Lewis was the leading scorer amongst the starters the other night against Hampton at 13 Heres Don Hall weaving into the lane for two Like the way he just worked his way around and saw what the defense gave him Wasnt probably the play setup they were looking for but he found his shot Starting lineup on the bottom of your screen here for the Thundering Herd Jaylen Spear coming off a careerhigh 12 assist performance against Elon The most assists by a hurt player since 2019 They have an offensive foul inside Its on Vancoui battling down low Jocking for position down there on the block It gets a little bit physical down there A little bit too physical for the whistle Cavaliier lineup here Tess Ditter the 69 freshman forward but he is 22 years old from Belgium Backtoback 20point efforts to begin his collegiate career Ditter a quiet five against Hampton Here he is on the ball challenging the shot blocker but cant get it to go This is Wyatt Frrics who has had just a tremendous start this season coming off a careerhigh 34 points against the Phoenix Caleb Hollandbeck tried to save it Goes to the counts and Hall draws the whistle Yeah you know its got to be a rare occasion where big 6 7 69 guy goes down there and sees a guy taller than him that hes got to evade to get to the shot And taller by a sizable margin in there There we are There is Jaylen Spear over a thousand points in his D1 career And now Hall at the line who has really ran the show very nicely for UVA so far this season keeping the turnover numbers low as he gets the kind bounce Three nothing Hooves Now Virginia scoring at least 80 points in the first three games this season First time thats happened since 20067 The Cavaliers scored 80 or more four straight to begin that season It is a different era here at UVA It is a different era the points start to go up on the board early and they dont stop until the end And there are several people on the team that can contribute to those points We talk start talking about threepointers and that point production Down low Fritz Oh theres that big shot blocker Johan Punlow with block number 15 on the year to Ritter Pull back Jay Yes sir Ta Ritter averaging just over 15 points per game so far in the early goings this year Cavaliers by five This is Noah Oshudi coming over from Canada from Western University in London Ontario And down low another transfer Van Kman from Elon Vancom with the easy put back there off of the miss He is a bigger focal point offensively here with Marshall than he has been in years past with other schools Heres Malik Thomas to the cutter Lewis Van Kman a factor down low and Marshall creates the takeaway Good defense by Marshall on that end of the floor Oh theres a big target down low Van huge radius to snare it Im waiting for him to get that rim rock and he is able to get up there Hes just kind of putting it in gently I think the whole gym is waiting for that Such a seasoned vet His seventh year of college basketball Started his career way back in 2019 with Utah Derritter has a look Holland Beck the feed Spear three That doesnt go to Ritter on the box now Pressure from behind Ditter regains right down the runway Barrels into a defender Blocking foul is called here and its on Holland back And how about the Ritter in transition You dont normally see a forward able to go in to end in that way to get down there with the with the ball handles able to go through the traffic Thats something to be said about you know those players Coach uh ODM has a couple of players that can do that forwards that can actually put the ball on the deck and get to the hole Yeah At any time Coach Odum has four different ball handlers on the floor as Dreer looks to increase this Cavaliers lead Projected as a second round pick had he decided to go to the NBA but instead going to college Heres tomorrows ACC Network Womens basketball double header at 3 music Eastern Georgia Tech plays host to Jacksonville at Mckameish Pavilion Then Florida State welcomes in Indiana to Tallahassee Both are also available on the allnew ESPN app Offensive rebound here Malik Thomas getting physical down low applause See a little bit of pressure here from the Cavaliers picking up full court Something that coach ODM has said thats something theyre looking to do and not necessarily Crystal with the goal of forcing turnovers really to slow down the opponent Right You start picking up full court that cause them to spend more time in that back court there and then its going to eat up a lot of clock Its going to be a long time before they can get their play established on the offensive end before then theyre deep into their shot clock Long pass Chance Mallerie recently inserted into the game with the steel Freshman fires it ahead and some contact here on Jaylen Spear And how about that pace getting from one end to the other for the Cavaliers They were able to move from the other end real quickly Its hard to get that transition defense going if youre Marshall So Spear exits the game here with two quick fouls and Marshall with four early on Not even four minutes in Cavaliers using that depth Shakari White is in for the Whos now wearing the number six Thomas no hesitation applause Just what youd expect to see from long range Now Malik has struggled a little bit to begin this season from beyond the arc Four for 16 prior to this game comes over from San Francisco where he led the WCC in scoring with 20 per game Oudi down low to the back of center Eric Harding Oh Virginias bench loves this suffocating defense And we have the foul up front and its on the Whos Thomas I like how well the Virginia defense is moving Virginia currently on a 60 run to extend the emphasis for UVA taking about 29 threepointers per game so far this music season Malik Thomas nailing that one for the Whos Coach feels really good about his team music shooting the three especially the right threes when they have a good look at it Virginia making about 11 threes per game Thomas certainly a guy who could fill it up from beyond the arc and you make the comparison right from the Tony Bennett era to the Ryan ODM era This is a team thats going to spread you out and look for that three ball Yeah And you feel good about doing that when you have players that can shoot a pretty high clip from behind the arc but you also feel good when you have folks that can reel in the missed shot if they have it So theyve got some big players that can pull some rebounds when necessary And like you mentioned there a lot of guys have the green light but theyre not going to force bad ones Yeah you dont want just any look You want the right look Speaking of Holland Beck Now Caleb shot the ball pretty well from threepoint range to begin this season Eight for 18 Yeah he had a good look right there Something just went wrong You probably overthought it to be honest with you Those are some of the hardest shots to make when youre that wide open You overthink getting your brain a little bit but dont expect him to stay that way for long Transfer from Gillette College in Wyoming Hit over a 100 threes last season Uh Onenso in the game doing the work down low to score over Harding Nice solid work by him down there He thought about kicking it back out He didnt see anything there so he went ahead and called his own number 7footer senior from Nigeria coming in from Kansas State Coaching staff really didnt expect him to be this much of a presence offensively but he proved his worth in the offse Oudy on the step back over Dinner Misses badly Mallerie cleans up the mess Chance streaking ahead in transition Open shooter Thomas Good kick right there by Chance Mallerie had his eyes wide open The league ready to take it Oh quickly in transition for Marshall Fricks nearly cherrypicking And thats something that the Cavaliers are going to have to keep their eye on They get up and back really quickly Those long passes right to the guy for the shot Taking a look at right there onion So see hes thinking about it Hes thinking about kicking it back out He said You know what I think Im at a good angle Ill get to work here Get my shot right off the glass 7 foot five wingspan So pretty easy for him to get shots up especially against guys who are a little bit shorter than him like Harding was on that assignment Well and you got like you know how cerebrally he is He probably knows you know what the play is Were trying to run the play Lets look at the options first but then okay if that doesnt work lets go ahead and just be a player He said in the past at his previous two two stops Kentucky and Kansas State he was a little bit shy to shoot the ball but the coaching staff here giving him all the confidence in the world Elijah Gertrude in the game here Gertude really athletic 64 red shirt sophomore Total of eight points in the first three And I almost get the feeling Chance Mallerie could have gone ahead and taken that shot That extra pass down on the baseline is always kind of dicey when you get down there with the congestion He had a wideopen layup Granted there was some height down there but they were a little bit offkilter He might have had a shot Speaking of height Matt Vanman is back in the game Had the first four points for the Thundering Herd THOMAS IS FEELING IT Hes adding them up already Three in a row 11 points Hes made all four of his shots from the field A push off here Offensive cheering foul Oudy Well Crystal there you go Theyre not necessarily looking for turnovers but sometimes you get them when you press Yeah you get those when you press Look at this right here though Coming down there Leak ready to shoot from three Nothing but net The guys automatic You like that pin down screen from Onenso too Yeah options Options Shot doesnt go You got Onenso Cavaliers clearly trying to get the ball into number ones hands Thomas Bank shot applause Theyre playing such a balanced game as uh Virginia right now Three ball goes up from Wilson Dubinski Transfer from South Carolina State Been a little cold on that end of the floor They much needed shot there to kind of stop the bleeding 21 to9 the score Well Dinsky is a guy they bring in for threepoint shooting all but one of his shots this season from beyond the ark Timer at 10 Hesitation move Jakari White I like how Jakari White just kind of waited them out there You know if you kind of wait long enough itll make them make a mistake Theyll kind of jump because they get a little antsy You know they know theyre going to put points on the board and theyve got to stop you from shooting So he held on to it a little bit but it was a making the defense uncomfortable Thomas to get a muchdeserved breather here Hes made all five of his shots thus far Yeah he definitely earned those minutes off to the side catching a breather Our next womens volleyball match is tomorrow afternoon between two of the top two teams in the conference number seven Louisville and number 14 Miami at 1 Eastern on ACC Network and the allnew ESPN app Jakari White makes a couple on his career 80 from the line and once again mantoman press from UVA And thats a lot of hard work You think about doing this type of pressing right throughout the course of the game One if youre Marshall youre not exactly sure when youre going to see it on every side on every play but also you got a lot of work to do for court applause Onenso stepping into the passing lane Turnover number five for the Marshall Thundering her White iso step back in the groove How about cheering that shot He set him up Gave him a little bit of work He also had a couple of words for him It looked like looking Hes got his fans The Chakari is here as they always have been over the first now four games Oudi jumper Theyre going to have to tie a couple more of those together But again the Virginia defense is making that very difficult as theyre eating up so much clock trying to get across half court They dont have much to work with in the second half Well you flip it on this end here Crystal How do the Herds stop Virginias offense right now Yeah theyre going to have to move a little bit better and be a little bit more predictive You know they cant get antsy and jump Ive seen a couple of times where theyre sitting and it takes the Virginia ball handler just a little bit of time to figure out what hes doing They get antsy they jump and that gives them an end It gives the the ball handler an end to get to the basket On this end the Thundering Herd five for their first 11 but again the five turnovers have been a problem thus far Heres Vancman Tied his D1 careerhigh with 14 in the victory over Elon Mallerie switches on to Dinsky here Timer at five Dubinsky waits and a lot of clutter inside Foul goes on the jumping ono Why hes on preseason watch list for the Jerry West shooting guard of the year Theres a reason for that and hes proving it right now Wilson Dubinsky at the line drawing the foul prior to the break 14point lead for UVA Yeah I mean hes going to be in good company right Chaz Laneir has had it before from Tennessee RJ Davis from North Carolina Several people have been on that watch list and he is in the running for that as this year goes on It will be very interesting to see as this season continues for UVA who ends up leading them in scoring Is it a tester Ritter Is it a Malik Thomas Is it someone else How much is it going to vary on a night bynight basis They have a lot of options Does Virginia coach ODM has recruited wisely Hes got several players that can put the ball in the bucket essentially and thats what you want to do Mallerie uncorks from way downtown Ditter snatches the board and scores Such a solid player is Ditter Hes able to clean it up You saw Marshall there transition into a zone And you hear coaches talk about it all the time Rebounding out of a zone Very challenging Yeah it is very challenging to rebound out of a zone because your position is a little bit off and sometimes youre not necessarily right on a player to put a body on them Now theyve got to get theyve got 10 seconds Got to get something going on the offensive end They just penetrated the threepoint arc Van Coleman right there waiting for it And thats what you wanted for Dinsky tried to get a shot up and it was off the mark All right lets find out if this zone can maybe styy the Whos Virginia 10 of its first 14 from the field Theres a big wide open middle in that zone And thats where you have to go right If youre the offense break it You got to break the zone Its just like if you do fullcourt zone press you get the ball in the middle the whole thing breaks down Oudy playing the point guard spot First time in his career Steel to Ritter Goes up Scores He wants the foul but he didnt need it He made the shot right off a rip And then heres Virginia back picking up fullourt pressure Offensive foul Van Coleman Illegal screen Hard screen by Van Coleman Ditter ran into just a brick wall there He wasnt looking ahead of himself and he kind of ran right into it Theres a little extra on the end there it looked like by Van Kman And we can see the frustration there by Ditter from that contact He already wanted the contact on the shot when he came down offensively to try to make the layup He wanted contact there and then he got this contact here Hes just not looking You see the extended arms by Van Comman Officials are going to call that every time 74 255 You run into that brick wall Its going to hurt Yeah youre going to feel that And theyre still in the zone trying to move around there and just kind of clog it up a little bit But high low IT WORKS TO WINNER TO Bruo picking up full court again You know thats what you like about European players as well because they are a style of play They do do a lot of passing high low to the post and thats something that is a benefit to these players Yeah they will initiate offense in the hands of Ditter Sometimes theyll do it even with Bruno too Under 10 to play now in the first half Cavaliers lead sizable at 17 Bruno pointing to the rim Instead it goes for Derritter Hes so calm in that spot Yeah theres going to be a lot of points that are going to come from just that place in the lane because its wide open You see the high low play there Again European players theyre used to looking for each other in that way You know kind of pass post to post Thats not something thats uncommon in that style of play and theyre very good for it Ritter now with six assists so far this season Not a high number but it shows you that hes a capable distributor with the basketball in his hands But the delay of game warning by the way was handed out to Malik Thomas Spear Nice movement here cheering Ruo confused but hes the one called for the contact against Vancomman And thats the benefit of a tall player I mean a player with that level of height You can kind of just float the ball up there Its going to be hard for defenses to try to like stop that And what ends up happening often is a foul Johan Grunlo he is such a disruptor down low Seven blocks in the opener against Ryder the most by a Virginia freshman since 2002 Jason Cart had nine against BMI On Tuesday mens basketball double header on ACC Network Itll feature Caleb Wilson in number 18 North Carolina hosting Navy at the Dean Smith music Center at 7 Eastern Then Donnie Freeman and Cayenne Anthony Yes the son of Melo leading Syracuse against Mammoth Those games are also available on the allnew ESPN cheering Really needed those free throws Van Kman unable to knock any of those either of those down Thundering Herd have knocked down 70 of their free throws coming into today Now Grunlove one v one here Waiting spinning adjusting Oh hes a dancer down low Yeah I love the patience He waited for the right spot Waited for Vanc to take the wrong step and then he made his move Was that Dance Dance Revolution It certainly looked like it Lets give that a beat Now defending Van showing off his moves And he made the move but he was a little surprised when he lost the defense and he was wide open Thomas turned aside Nice block there from Fricks Landon Joseph is in the game number six Freshman from Fort Lauderdale Gets around to Ritter Test calling for the foul Doesnt like it all that much but now he makes the signal Yeah its on me All right I I got it Yeah hes frustrated that it happened at all but Joseph so quick off the bounce that first step got in front of him and of course he went for the block and it was just a raw gamble Now Virginia one of the best shot blocking teams in the nation thus far Just about 10 blocks per game only behind Satan Hall Thats the benefit of someone like Joseph someone thats quick You know youve got these taller players kind of coming out on the perimeter to guard you You can get that first step on them Put them in a bad position Theyre going to have to play it in the air and often that can come up You can come up with a foul on that Couple of games ago Joseph had 11 in the win over Toledo That was a strong win for the Thundering Herd against a Rockets team that really has dominated at home 59 and 11 from 2020 music to the start of this year Spoke with Corny Jackson before the game Said You know what We stacked the deck pretty tough with our schedule in the noncon I didnt think at this juncture wed be where we are but hes been very pleased And he has good reason to be I mean his team has showed up and showed out Out of bounds it goes And weve got Grillo Hes had a couple of good moves on the offensive end doing his work and getting it done down on the block See one for five but they havent found the right shots to put him down They also havent been able to get that fast break threepointer that they are known to do So whats the solution then How does Marshall get that three ball availability Theyre going to have to get the ball up the court quicker more carefully but theyre going to have to get the ball up the court quicker and get into their set so they can find got to create spacing So Joseph makes the midrange shot there Its a beautiful shot by the way But I think the Cavaliers are okay with that shot Yes because its a twopointer and thats not really that dangerous You know they kind of left him a little bit of room to do that Its when they start getting around the arc and getting dangerous from out there that will raise the eyebrows of the Cavaliers The drive and kick right when Marshall gets that going Gruno on a post iso here against Van Coleman And Gruno swiftly moves his way through the lane did a good job of putting Vancom in a bad position where he wasnt able to defend Theres that transition three theyve been looking for No conversion there Hollandbeck but a restart now for the hurt So its going to be an on ball screen right Potentially a drive and kick or the fade Wow what a terrific shot from Spear Its a good shot from Spear but still a two they need the three Theyre going to be in search of for a little while here Malik Thomas returning here 13 points now five for six from the floor He started off hot A lot of things are going like were talking a lot about the perenn perimeter but lets look down low We see Gruno going to work on Vanc again Hes putting him in a bad spot Gets around him and theres not really much he can do to defend if he doesnt want to foul and thats just smart work by Grulo Yeah we talked with Coach Odum before the game as well about the post ISOs Its a big part of the Cavaliers offense this year And we said Okay you know Marshalls got a good center in Van Kman Can you do that against them And Brian said Yeah were going to do that this afternoon Expect it Exactly He knows what he has You know hes recruited Hes recruited Hes been working with these guys since the summer Hes seen what their capabilities are He knows exactly what hes got Lewis makes a pair One of the best threepoint shooters coming over from the back in Toledo Lewis will now exit So here comes the pressure Marshalls going to have to get the ball up the floor quickly and safely in order to have any chance of getting a good shot and particularly those long range shots theyre looking for But this guy is a thorn in everyones side right now Chance Mallerie is just annoying Yeah thats right Thats his job You know be as annoying as possible Do not make this easy Hes a very quick guard Eight steals in the first three games this season So here they are pretty eventless getting the ball up the court Theyve got plenty of time on the shot clock now Theyve got to get something going to get it somebody who can get a good look at a three hopefully for them Not much yet for Fricks who comes off a 34point game against Eli Shot clock at seven That is another tough contested Jay that doesnt go for Joseph this time He tried to get the ball down inside to Van Kman and thats another way to get that threepoint shot right getting it inside Thomas a bounce Floater goes up off the heel from Grunlock Spear feeds Pricks No dice Thats the one he wanted but its a little hard when youve been called and havent had a whole lot of touches Gruno running the floor beating Van Kman and gets the deuce Another smart play by Gruno Shot fake Took his time and took the right shot Man the Cavaliers are surging offensively doubling up the Thundering Herd And UVAs made twothirds of its shots thus far Dribble off the sneaker Steel Mallerie blitzes the paint Fricks the rejection Called for a foul though And thats one of those plays where Chance Mallerie knew he didnt actually have a path to the basket to get a clean shot But if he can put his body in the right position he can draw the foul And thats exactly what he did Explosive chance Mallerie As soon as he gets the ball hes off to the races You got to be ready to respond or get in front and try to deter him in any way you can They just werent able to do it right there More was Marshall and now hes at the line 16 points against the Pirates back on Tuesday night Virginia winning that game by 38 points Thundering Herd make a change here Noah Ochudi the point guard back in for the Thundering Herd for the Cavaliers getting Mallerie some really good experience early on as a reserve having Don Hall to really kind of instruct him a little bit Its been a nice blend for the Cavaliers so far Yeah it has been And coach Odin spoke about their relationship in the preseason Says theyve been getting on really well and I think its a good uh I its a good situation for Chance to have Don ahead of him that he can kind of learn from him and he can maximize his effort as well The Cavaliers will constantly rotate players on and off the floor Spear gets a look Thomas on the trampoline squeezing down the board And hes got a chance to score Oh Thomas No hesitation Its all threats He had a chance to score and he took the chance to score Ah but picked up the foul right after it And thats not what you want first half of the game Hes going to have to sub out just got on the floor and made a difference and hes going to have to sit Well hes upset because he knows he just picked up his second Correct And he just got in the game and he picked up his second right after that I think coach is probably telling him Hey I love you being aggressive I need you in the game Lob all the way to the rim Fricks a high catch tapping the pass over to Harding Thundering Herd Good ball movement here Slay didnt look at it applause They had some ball movement and it looked like you got the feeling something was about to open up but then they lost it cheering Well the Thundering Herd they take a lot of threes but one of the issues for them offensively and I say issues theyve won all three of their games They turn it over on about 21 of their possessions which is one of the bottom 10 ranks in the nation Yeah And thats just theres no way to kind of continue or get continuity on offense if youre turning the ball over And thats going to become more important the further they move into their season Particularly when you start getting into conference play youre not going to be able to turn it over at such a high clip Theyre going to have to keep their eye on that and make some good clean solid decisions Nine giveaways for Corny Jacksons team so far And more free throws for the Cavaliers in the double bonus now Virginia at the line so far eight for 10 And its just been Virginia attacking on the offense whenever they get the opportunity One of the biggest things thats working for them is getting the ball in the lane They may not always get their points from in the lane but getting the ball in the lane opens up so many other options offensively and its giving them the ability to grab pretty much anything they want And when you have a guy like that in Tess Ritter it really confuses the opposing coach Who do you try to shut down And Corny Jackson said Look number one on our list the physicality that the Cavaliers provide Yeah And thats something that you really have to contend with They have that because theyve got the size And again theyve got these big players that can stretch you out and get out on the perimeter but then take you physically down there on the block Steel off the press Lewis a kick Hall is wide open Great series of events for Virginia Heads up play applause Allen Hall has not been much of a scorer just yet in his Cavaliers tenure We have a cheering loose ball foul here and its on Marshall And this Cavaliers fan base is loving what theyre seeing right now Yes the hustle And we talked about you know coach ODM subbing in and out because he wants to get that hard explosive play from his players And the way youre able to get that is to keep fresh legs in the game So weve been watching rotations right To keep those fresh legs in the game And thats really how you bewilder the other team Well we said towards the top of our show Virginias press the idea is not necessarily to create turnovers but flip the script a little bit Yeah And its almost its really hard not to create the turnovers out of a press also because youre rushing the team Youre making them uncomfortable right from the jump Right from the inbound theyre already uncomfortable and then youve got the length of the floor to continue to make him so In which case its really easy to see teams getting in situations where they turn the ball over 53 points for Virginia in not even 16 minutes Does this fan base understand what thats like laughter Theyre used to seeing them win games with 53 and 40 Yeah laughter exactly Joseph gliding towards the cup gets the bounce Nice floater by Joseph You know its funny Coach Odum has said in a couple of different settings press conferences said you know if we play really well defensively crowds going to understand what to do If we get shot clock expirations by the opponent theyre going to cheer They have to get used to the offense Yeah they have to get used to that happening Mallerie a look Drew Fugquay is in the game Number four in the green junior from Detroit transferring in from Gillette College just like Holland And already the defense for Virginia has got him down to 16 seconds in the shot clock Oudy hanging and delivering a bucket And again points We talked about this a little while ago Virginia is okay with the twos right Because chipping back into this lead would be or chipping back into this game is going to be a lot harder doing it off of twos And particularly if theyre twos without like an and one or some bonus a after that Yeah 15 of the 23 shots so far for Marshall from twopoint range Lewis a trifecta Gruo Three games for UVM Dwight rejects Dwight elevates Another o board and a whistle inside and more free throws for UVA applause Yep And Virginia has just been getting it done Theyve been all over the place Theyre getting it done on the defensive end See that quick hands right music here Pass back in and theyre getting the shots Virginia all over it in this first half Explosive offense You go back to Marshalls last game against Elon that was a highscoring game They won 96 89 So a lot of possessions in this game And the Cavaliers are capitalizing on that Yeah And you could see how Marshall could get to this scoring because theres glimpses of it right Theyre able to get the ball up the floor pretty quickly and get a really quick trigger pull on the other end but that just hasnt been happening because Virginia defense has been picking up and pressuring them and just really stying everything that they are thinking about doing on the offensive side UVA has shown the speed Cavaliers have shown the physicality Fouls are mounting for Marshall Spear has three fouls here in the first half Frics has two Van Kman has two Big problem It is a big problem Theyre gonna have to keep levelhead and try to chip away They really need to get some movement going on the offense right now Real stagnant here for a couple of seconds and those are precious seconds Oudi gets White to pretty much jump over him and he gets the bucket Yeah it was a hard shot fake there White knew he had it but he didnt at that point so he kind of flew out of bounds there And now a mild pressure here from Marshall picking up at like three quarter court Onenso twisting inside Theres that big shot blocking presence of Van Kman Van Kman able to get up there But its something that not many people have to worry about is getting his arm caught in the rim Yeah I wish I had that problem Yeah I dont think Ive ever You and I are never going to have that problem No Yeah He He went his block We still a deterrent but he also has to watch and not get caught up in the net in the rim You could put me on a pogo stick I still wouldnt have that problem Not at all Nothing available but a foul is called here on Virginia And it goes against Hall for a hold Virginia now with 16 fouls So the Cavaliers are now out of fouls to give Yeah I believe hes trying to fight through a screen A lot of screens and out of bounds plays You got to fight through those to make sure they dont get the quick easy shot Boy we were at Virginias shoot around this morning They spend a lot of time locking in on the oppositions baseline out of bounds play The blob Yeah the blob The ever famous blob Yeah Because I mean theres a lot of screens that come out of that and this Marshall team can get a three out of that They need quick touches Slay three Yes Bryce Slay with the tray And thats the thing Thats why they spend so much time worrying about that They only need 1 seconds worth of touch you know on the ball before they can get the shot off and knock down a three Very quick trigger Under a minute and a half to go now in the first half Cavaliers shooting at 60 and more free throws for UVA The Whos have taken 16 at the line so far Yeah this is something common that you see often too from teams that are in the situation where Marshalls at right now 30 to 54 A little bit of frustration We have to stop something music Well for Marshall that might stop Van Kman from being on the floor Thats his second foul So the Thundering Herd folks have five players with multiple fouls so far in the game Yeah And when you try to stop the bleeding you know youve got a team particularly when theyre able to get it into the lane its just a danger area right Thats where a lot of good things happen If youre the defense youve got to make bad things happen there And in doing so you often get yourself in foul trouble Instant offense not there for Marshall Virginia gets back defensively Right They were able to break the press but Virginia was already there waiting on him High screen here from Vancman Joseph a bounce Van Kman waits and on Yenso gets a piece Anna did say in his presser the other day I am one of the best shot blockers in the country I didnt mean to be cocky he said but thats the reality Its good to be selfaware Onenso waits Onenso with two and he can put up some points also Onenso hadnt seen him in a little while but hes back on the floor He and Vancoman will be going at it Game and shot here separated by 15 Marshall not bad offensively 46 from the floor but the 12 turnovers have really cost the Thundering Herd Step back three Joseph front nylon And thats an important stat right Theyre not bad when theyre able to get their shots They just havent been able to get them Theyve turning the ball over and a lot of that is due in part to the Virginia defense Joseph now has the team lead with nine points and 13 on the season coming in 5 seconds to play First down White pump fake pull back Trey yes Oh white is on target And the Jakari his lot of foul trouble for the Thundering Herd as well in the opening 20 minutes Spear back in with three Spear veering and caps one off with a bucket Nice touch there Theyre going to need to see more And now theyre picking up at least manto man on the point guard to try to zigzag him down there Virginia 20 of 32 from the field in the first half And Virginia for their part able to get a lot of points in the paint Yep This is a basket interference call Matt Van Coleman holding on to the rim and Virginia will get two more Yeah a little preemptive there trying to block the shot Virginia has 22 points in the paint and thats come from both the post players and just the drives and you see Marshall trying to find something going here again Theyre going to need to get a paint touch and get something inside to try to open up that ball reversal and get an open shot on ball screens are helpful Quiet first half for Fricks Tried to make his name announced and Johan Bruno needs to be held back because he strongly disagrees with this call Yeah And Frics he wanted the home run dunk Great He went in there You see him he takes off from a little ways back Thought he had it wide open but he missed it I think he got a little contact there Obviously the official blew the whistle Coo fans arent happy You see the numbers from Frics the 34 points on Wednesday Frics was 13 for4 from the field Best field goal percentage by a herd player with at least nine shots ever And its obviously hes capable Hes proven there Hes capable of some point production You know its really hard to produce when youre cold when you havent really got a whole lot of touches in the game when you were able to get the your hands on the ball You have to be able to be efficient and get the ball down And its just been hard to do for any of the players really on the Marshall team And now Virginia able to take their time Theres really no rush for them to like put points on the board They just need to go slow and steady here And Hall is the guy to do that They nickname him Steady Eddie And theres that defense again picking up full court Got a hand on the ball Feeling the pressure Marshall before they even got it in Now Ryan Odum was looking back at some of his bench personnel to decide if he wanted to challenge that one but in a 28point game he decides to hold on to that challenge as they are comfortably in the lead Not really need to use the timeout there Spear releases a deep tray Van Coleman tightroing that far sideline Tries to get a step here on Grunlow and gets whacked here from Thomas And if its on Malik thats his third And yes it is All right so Thomas with the active hands just getting him into kind of some bad places in this game Thats something hes going to want to pay a little bit more attention to You know obviously being aggressive is great Thats what you want out of your players but you got to do that in the smartest of ways Well the luxury of this big lead for Ryan ODM he can leave a guy like Thomas in the game with three fouls and maybe see how he reacts to that and maybe games of more importance moving forward Yeah exactly Situational basketball right So and thats really what we were talking about that in the break You know when youve got a lead like this the focus for both teams shifts right Gruo fingertips on that shot Credit him with another block J is going to be looking to see what they can do to your point Want to see things like Emily Thomas you know hold on to it and not foul out of the game when hes got as many fouls Grunlo adjusting and sees the seven for Vanc Van Kman good for a lot of blocks You would imagine at his height that thats true 11 blocks coming in Open three for Hollandbeck Two players boxing out Vancman there and Derer hustling after it Smacks it to himself Test going to work Swooping across the lane No Hall put back and the PGs going to the line Oh Don Hall You dont see him go in for many offensive rebounds but he found himself in the paint Yeah the hustle by Virginia just to stay after it you know and actually twice I saw both players kind of look at the shot think twice about it and then say you know what Im just going to go ahead and try to go for it Hes like Yeah Im going to put that back Don Hall transfer from BYU Career highs in most statistical categories a couple of years ago but last year made the Sweet 16 with the Cougars Heres tomorrows ACC Network womens basketball double header at 3 Eastern Georgia Tech playing host to Jacksonville music McKameish Pavilion Then FSU tangles with Indiana in Tallahassee Both are also available on the allnew ESPN app Free throw is good Pressure kicks on And again Marshall situational basketball How will you handle the press And its a good litmus test for the Thundering Herd Over the last 3 four years the Sunb Belt Conference has been a pretty physical lead cheering Thomas lofting it ahead Fricks intercepts Fricks was waiting for that one Spear a fade away from the baseline And again we I mean I dont want to harp too much on this point but the threepoint shots for Marshall they really havent had any looks from out there Theyre going to have theyve been having to settle for the twopointers Sam Lewis quite okay with an open three Yeah When the Thundering Herd came into this building I think they knew that the talent disparity would point towards UVA So how do you make that up by making a bunch of threes Yeah Yeah I mean when you start talking about field goal efficiency you have to kind cheering of match that in some way Youre going to have to get into chip into that lead So Ritter cleaning up his own mess applause and and at the same time as we said the focus changes So is Marshall in a position where theyre thinking lets try to win this game Lets climb out of his lead and get it Or are they looking at lets look at situational basketball Lets talk about what we can learn from each possession Yeah So again theyre looking at possession for possession Were going to take a couple look at look at turn soon We did see him prior to the game getting a workout in on the court here at JPJ So that was a really good sign Yeah hes a good sign when they can get a little bit of up and back just on their own It looks like he they might be the way may be close to over you know for the team and Im sure that nobodys more excited about that than coach Odum part of a team last year with UC Irvine that won a program record 32 games and he was a big reason why And Virginias got the ball ready to inbound Now its Marshall picking up full court trying to get something going again Youd expect you know coach Cornney to test out a couple of things for with his team in situations like this Ditter bodies up here against Fricks Cant score Nice rebound inside Dinsky Physical play by Derritter I mean you see the shots hes given the post player down there and hes just absorbing them I mean thatll wear you down Well he does have the finesse part of the game as well He can shoot the three cheering Joseph wheels around the screen Pull back jumper Front iron Oudy with an extra look here for Marshall cheering Frick surveys says Ill just take it myself here And Wyatt has not gotten going tonight like he did on Wednesday against Elon Yeah he just hasnt been able to get his shots to fall Hes gotten not a whole lot of them in this game but they just havent been able to go down either Johan Gruo splashes down a three First one hes hit in college And hes showing his capabilities Over the shoulder shot Van Kman sprinkles it down He had to work for that one His body was a little bit awkward He had to turn around there and shoot it as a demi hook I guess we can call it Unable to get it to drop Eight points and eight rebounds for Van Coleman Grunlow has another look Out of bounds it goes stays with the Whos good chance to test I mean good opportunity to test out the range for players like Bruno coach ODMs like hey shoot it if you can shoot it he said hell take threes hell take the right threes and that will look like the right one so Crystal you see the drop coverage there with Van Kman you cool with that yeah no I mean laughter you got to be able to uh you know to cover at all times and like you cant afford to drop at Lugana Onenso back in gobbles up a rebound and earns the foul against Eric Harding But again thats what makes it so hard right Youre not used to most of the time you see you know host player kind of float out to the threepoint line You kind of put your feet up and you rest or maybe you help out teammates start thinking about helpside defense Uh but then youve got players like Bruno Ditter who can actually stretch it out And of course we talked about Ugo earlier Um and that just makes it very hard to match up with Onenso expecting the pass closer to the rim and Oudi is fouled by Mallalerie here prior to the shots Noah Audi coming over from Western University located in London Ontario Last season averaged 16 and 12 points per game Coach Courtney Jackson really likes this guy Hes playing as a point guard for the first time and hes showing him a lot of clips of Dan Hurley coaching his point guards over the year at Yukon Hard coaching for the guards Nice shot by Dinsky Nice long shot by Dinsky But yeah coaching the guards I mean thats how you get the best out of your players right You sometimes got to squeeze it out of them and do the best you can And you feel like the coach respects them still You know they have great relationship Yeah Coach Jackson said I coach my guards really really hard Paul slicing in Two more free throws for UVA The Cavs are 16 for 20 at the stripe tonight Yeah and for the most part I mean the Cavaliers have been doing a great job as far as is fouling They really havent given a whole lot of opportunities to Marshall as far as from the line Theyve been doing a good job for themselves on defense Coming up at 330 Eastern on ESPN 2 number 19 UVA takes on Duke in Durham Stakes are high Both teams looking music to stay in the hunt for a ticket to the ACC championship game in Charlotte Virginia Duke two of the five teams currently with only one loss in the conference That is going to be a music spectacular game Chandler Morris quarterback for UVA I know a lot of Cavaliers fans wondering will he play He is listed as probable after the Cavaliers come music off a loss last week here at home against Wake Forest And by the way we might have some fans who are tuning in around this time because they realized wait I thought that game was supposed to start at 2 Yes they moved the game to 1200 so they can accommodate the UVA fans trying to watch the football game at 330 Lots of sports to watch today as well You may forget if youre a basketball fan Oh right Theres football going on as well Very important football Thats right And Im very impressed with the student turnout Yeah thats true Student turnout on a noon game on a Saturday Its actually early for those of you who may not remember that long ago for noon on a Saturday is actually kind of early for college Wait wait wait Youre telling me that these kids werent you know nose in the books at 900 am today What Yeah Even though they took a break from uh studying they rolled out made it to support their I mean you got to love that dedication Joseph a swipe here and then a foul So the Thundering Herd with possession and its gone pretty quiet Its mostly strategy right from both benches right here to try to see what things they can hash out Xs and Os at this point You know when youve got a a point differential like this then you kind of start looking at Xs and Os to try to see what different things you can put together to affect change In your study of Marshall from their first three games what have you liked I like I like their threepoint shooting I mean they do have the ability to do that They do have some versatility with the uh from the post from the you know from the front court I like that theyre able to to pull the rebounds when they get the opportunity to do it But I really like the fact that they are able to kick those shots up pretty quickly Thats just something that is its kind of a gamble as well right Cuz when youre doing that then you run the risk of sending the other team down the other way in a fast break situation So it is a gamble but I do like that about them Now Coach Jackson is going to love that his freshman Landon Joseph has performed well 12 points in his brief Division One career Thats the most hes had Well hit a timeout here Ryan ODM wants to talk it over with his crew as will Corny Jackson music Virginia leads by 24 to rally behind someone on the team So Ben Miller a student DM Jakari on Instagram over the summer with this idea to design tshirts with Jakaris face on them Hed be their general and their following so far Yeah And what a feeling it must be to have an army behind you I mean maybe a little bit of pressure but I dont think theyll be disappointed Jakari has been a great addition here for UVA and it has been fun to see what those guys behind the visiting bench have had to celebrate thus far I mean they even got their own culture right They salute everything So well they said that they really enjoy Jakaris threepoint shooting his hustle his athleticism And uh Ben Miller by the way he also said that they are looking to expand the Jakarmi So if you want to be you know part of the uh hey I want to get group over there You can find them on Instagram at thejakarmi Yes they have an Instagram page They are that unified I love it I love it Hey the younger Hey I can say this and hopefully not give away too much but this younger generation right they can move fast with these sorts of things They batched out the shirts Theyve got their own social media set up Were ready to market Ready to get going All right Heres White with the ball We have a foul down low which oh just puts a damper into the leadup there We thought we were getting a Jakari ISO for the Jakari to celebrate Not happening team both went to St Ans Bellefield here in Charlottesville Have developed a nice connection throughout the years Chance by the way did lose that game of horse to Kamura and we made mention of that to him in the shootound today And Chance does not want to talk about that game anymore He wants to put it to rest Yeah he was ready to let that one go Just exposed you to the whole world My my bad But boy Chance is just so electrifying with his defense We saw him the other night put up a good scoring effort against Hampton with 16 Previous play is under review for potential player foul And AJ Desai is letting us know that well review for the potential of a flagrant foul And yeah I mean I I love back to your point about Kamura and Chance you know the two guards music having the opportunity to kind of size up against each other and just think like a friendly game of horse Now Kamura was a twotime Virginia Gatorade player of the year Chance the alltime leader in scoring at Stab Also led the program in assists steals and wins and a 45point game at one point for the Saints at 11 threes in a game The officials by the way Mr Desai alongside Jerry Heater Anthony Eids trying to decide if this last play was a flagrant foul After review the call on the floor stands as a common foul Number 28 will shoot one and one Okay so Tester Ritter goes to the line for a one and one here So it does not rise to the level of an F1 or an F2 Theres Eric Harding to Ritter so far 11 points five for 11 from the floor one for two at the line Makes on the first of the one and one applause Heres a look at what just happened Screen right there Good block and really solid jam there by Bryce Slay look like And youre cool with that right Slay standing his ground there essentially Yeah essentially hes just standing his ground He did It gets a little dicey a little questionable with that fact that he leaned into it a little bit But also when you see a big guy like Tess Ritter coming in you have to brace yourself or youre going to end up in the stands You know what they nickname him Whats that Tess the tank The tank of course Yes And if you translate his last name to Ritter into English it means the knights Ah tank Yeah I mean and very for very good reason Thats not a hit that anybody wants to take No No Thats a locomotive coming at you Yeah And thats the thing too I mean look at the I mean hes so mobile right with his size Hes very tall but hes also broad Three short three games Hustle play Oh the Jakarmi is going to love this They love hustle plays over there They love a hustle play Theyve been on their feet You got to love that dedication too Yeah The intelligence the smarts that Shakari and Jakari have And the inbound timer at 12 here for Ditter stepping through the lane with the long strides Heads up there in the first row Tester D Ritter 69 240 freshman from Belgium 22 years old Dont be disguised by him being listed as a freshman Couple of years of pro ball and top league in Spain Bill Bao basket Hes being asked to fill a bigger role here in the collegiate ranks than he was at the professional ranks overseas Yeah coach coach Odum said he likes that he plays with passion and emotion He just really likes the way that he plays and you could see that youve seen that at several points really in the first half He was very emotional when the game was a bit tighter Weve had a chance over the last couple of weeks to catch up with Tess Really nice individual He seems very comfortable here You mentioned those emotions though Brian ODM has also said he plays like a bully Quay with a three That doesnt count Yeah hes got the size to back that up You know thats not something you hear about a little five seven you know six foot player but somebody his size yeah you can play like a bully But I also like you know hes got the size and he plays very smart You know he throws his weight around but hes very intelligent about the weight He does it Hes not a bull in a china shop He doesnt go in and just break everything Uh hes very controlled player very smart player Even when hes ball handling hes making good decisions Wilson Dubinsky at the line here Both teams in a one and one Tubinsky coming over from South Carolina State where he shot over 40 and a half from threepoint range a year ago He was held scoreless against Elon but he had couple of good games to begin the season against UMass and Toledo Lee Thomas exiting the game with four fouls So he and Chance Mallerie both have four for the Whos and Jaylen Spear has four for Marshall The herd have been saddled with foul trouble all afternoon long And thats something you know you kind of expect to see when you have a bit a disparity between the two teams right and what theyre able to put on the floor Sometimes youre going to find the team that has a little bit more of a challenge ahead of them Theyll find themselves in a situation where they do get in foul trouble because theyre just trying to stop the bleed and trying to get something going Lifted over the head of Fuay that time Joseph making the claim it was tipped Corny Jackson telling his freshman Dont worry about it Next play Im actually pretty impressed with the guy in the first round that caught that and didnt get knocked out by it cuz laughter that was a little bit of heat on that It went straight through Well Virginia football does not need another wide receiver Theyre pretty stacked at that position So he may have to find another home On Yenzo wrapped up and fouled here Under 10 to go And more free throws now for the Whos Yeah I mean play on there I say heres that play See it flew right through his hand Hes like No I got it No problem No bobble either Not at all And Im telling you you know you see this with football right The receivers go out and when you got the guy the the balls coming defender reaches for the ball it throws off your eyes timing You end up getting knocked out by something like that But not this guy Can we check his hands for the sticky stuff just to make sure On Yenso on the first end of the one and one hits There he is just sitting there just as calm You would have no idea the man had those hands I mean hes locked in or confident Yeah he is the most locked in guy in the building right now in a 24point music game And thats why he was able to catch that ball He wasnt blinking Oh his familys going to hit him up over text very quickly I promise you They are Second free throw now for Onenso Doesnt get the bounce and Der gets called for a loose ball foul here And Tess now has three And this will result in free throws for Marshall This will end up being a free throw shooting contest the rest of the way So 13 minutes in this game Might have expected to see him a little bit more but uh considering you know where the score is but of course coach ODM has his strategy and what he wants to see on the floor So it all makes sense But for his part hes getting it done Two of four from the field So now Matt Vanman at the line cheering Van Kman hits on the first Hes been to a lot of different stops in college Started at Utah Three years at St Marys but didnt play two of those years Then he went to Hawaii Pacific a division 2 school in the 23 24 year Then Elon last year He was an allca defensive team member And look at all the injuries he suffered music the nvicular fractures The same injury that has plagued guys like Joel Embiid and Yao Ming metatitarsel that gets fractured He punched the wall and hes been honest about that It was a mistake Then he had his appendix removed This guy is put together with duct tape Yeah laughter its got to be frustrating though You hate that for any you know athlete You see them go through the injuries after injuries just trying to get a career going you know enjoying the sport and wanting to see what youre capable of doing And hes not really been at a place where hes been able to do that just yet Yeah Coach Jackson said We want him to be a focal point And they almost scared him when they brought him in for a workout in the off season music They told him You got to get the rebounding You got to go dribble yourself I know youre 74 and you might not be used to it but thats the game right now in the NBA Think a guy like Nicole Joic Yeah you got to be able to put the ball on the deck and at least get yourself to a reasonable position You know Van Coleman runs the floor Cant make the reception He moves very well for a sevenfooter He does You know I think about it too Something that I dont think a lot of people think about when youre that tall That was an easy slap away by you know the long reach long arms of Van Kman And And also Crystal Matt has a uh hes got a phenomenal stash That he does Can we make a comparison here You ready for this Yeah Lets see who we got Okay So I think it looks like that guy Tom Celich Yep Magnum PI Maybe Richard and Friends Well manicured facial facial hair the stash there statement piece Oh phenomenal I also thought of Sasha Barak Cohen is Borat Just couple different comparisons for you Little maintenance there Oh big time maintenance Something I would never have to worry about I cant grow that much facial I dont have to worry about that I hear that complaint from guys a lot You know they cant grow it or it doesnt grow in right Its patchy So you know I go one of two ways I go Oh okay Itd be nice to grow But also like it is a lot to you know manicure I dont want to do that You got to keep up with it Joseph in a fuddle here Two free throws cheering for Landon who can add on to his numbers 16 points six for nine from the floor Problem is his teammates have only combined to make 16 shots Yeah thats the frustration there You know and thinking about Vanc at his height something I dont think a lot of people think about is when youre talking about doing a jump shot at that height your angle is a little bit odd uh to the basket If you ever shot on a a kids rim it changes the angle that you have to shoot at in order to get it in there And its actually a very unique touch youd have to have to get like the jump shots the free throws all of that uh to go in because theres a different trajectory Chance Mallerie returns here Hell play with four fouls Elijah Gertru takes a seat So with a 7 foot4 guy its almost like you cant put as much arc on the ball when hes shooting Correct because youre only so far from the from the rim Well Marshall has played a decent second half here outscoring Virginia by eight points 28 to 20 since the break Well step aside here Virginia still comfortably in front music Aras Theus has experience as well with coach ODM over at BCU winning an A10 tournament title last year So he brought his guys over to Charlottesville and that continuity from the staff has been really nice for them Yeah Well they say its not what you do its who you do it with And he surrounded himself with a talented staff that he feels confident in Fris pulls up for three It has been a rough afternoon for Fricks Just four points Came into this afternoon averaging nearly 22 per game Van a factor down low though And Vancman gets a couple of free throws here 84 from the field coming into today 16 for9 He was second in the country only behind Northern Colorados Brock Whisy That guy is going to wreak some havoc in the Sunb Belt Conference this year cheering See Chance Mallerie back on the floor Cavaliers also going with tester Ritter back in the game Martin Carrer who was in for a brief moment checks out 69 freshman red shirted last year with DCU Came over from France Cavaliers using their depth as they have through the first four games this year UVA another clean game offensively The Whos have limited their turnovers to just seven but they dont have anything from the field in a while here About 7 and 12 minutes Almost on Q when you said that they almost tossed the ball out of bounds It was a deflected by a Marshall defender Now Ryan ODM talked about it in specific to the NC Central game eight days ago He said last 10 minutes of the second half I didnt love it Just the the execution wasnt as crisp And I think we might have a similar theme here Ditter cant score Offensive rebound grew low We have a push down low and it goes against Marshall So Cavaliers will get a chance for a couple more free throws here The fans mad that the uh what would have been an airball shot after the whistle was slammed down by the Marshall player there You know to your point you know coach ODM saying you know his mindset around I dont love you know the style of play you know kind of down the stretch And that speaks to the the mental discipline you know of your team being able to stay dialed in locked in even when youre ahead That toughness will serve you down the way you know when you start to get against teams that are going to grind you out Its a you know maybe more of a cerebral game Youve just got to stay locked in I think thats something you know coach is always going to be coaching so theyre going to notice those types of things Brandon a reminder the Cavaliers were bound to slow down a little bit but they had 61 points at halftime and that was a John Paul Jones Arena record Just over 7 minutes to go Oudi running the point for this team Van Coleman tries to carve out some space THE REVERSE JAM FOR THE 74 CENTER WOW Youre waiting for something like that to happen at any moment You know its 74 Youre waiting for one of those Ditter tries to get a field goal Hes got it applause Over eight minutes without one Coach Odin let up a little bit off of the pressure but youve got Chance Mallerie picking up full court Spear through traffic No Hall on the escalator for the board Van cheering Pman goes down behind the play Manpower advantage Whos Lewis swims out and now Fricks wants to run overshoots his target Spear cant keep it in You mentioned kitty hoops earlier I dont know if most people could do what Van Coleman just did on a kitty hoop Yeah and this definitely looked like a kitty hoop to him He was just looking to find his way The ball goes inside looking to find an angle around Gruno there Hes like you know what forget it Ill just go this way Hes like did he come off of his toes Okay he did come off the ground He did come off the ground just a smidge Barely needed to Van Kman I mean 7 foot4 You probably get a lot of those but its truthfully about finding the right angle to do it too Because at the end of the day you also have to think about injury You dont want to land wrong or anything like that just to get a dunk Sounds like you have experience in this uh field Oh yeah Dunking and trying to land correctly Absolutely 6 minutes to go in the second half Gruno one hand snare sees two Back to Ditter Late whistle but it is a foul on Marshall And yes more free throws He didnt Glo didnt respond the best to being doubled down there That double kind of came at him really fast when he got it Hes trying to find an open player there in the lane and almost caused him to turn the ball over but the foul was called so it stays with UVA Theyve got a chance to get some shots Virginia now 25 for 31 at the free throw line Free throw shooting had been a problem for the Whos and Ryan ODM early in the year very early in the year dating back to their exhibitions Vanderbilt and Villanovva And even in the first game against Ryder they shot just 19 for 34 at the line But theyve been much better since coach ODM wasnt necessarily too worried about that because he know he acquired really good shooters via the portal and via freshman recruiting Oh shooty Another contested Jay goes down Hes got nine offense for the Cavs Get the nice swing Skip pass Der Multiple whistles here Frustrated with the miss The Cavaliers applause want goalending And yes they are going to score the basket So it is a goalend and an and one try here for Der goes up You see the hand right there Looks like he came through the rim there did Van Kman on the trying to defend basket Well some project Tester Ritter as a top five player in the ACC Well find out if those projections become reality once we get to conference play Virginia starts ACC play on New Years Eve against Virginia Tech But Ditter now with three 20 plus point games in his first four in college Well Chudy sees Gruno and Johan makes the claim hey I I jumped straight up But Jerry Heater doesnt agree Yeah he kind of he did make contact there and thats one of those situations you dont want to bail him out of he didnt have anywhere to go You dont want to bail him out by kind of making that contact and be a little more careful But at the same time if youre used to playing a physical game then youre not as averse to getting that contact you know on on the shot Youre used to being aggressive cheering Oh Judys first doesnt go here for Marshall Cavaliers in front by 22 And the starters for UVA have really controlled the show today talked about the bench in their last game against Hampton Not really much from the reserves so far cheering Yeah the reserves have not and I feel like thats because coach ODM has kind of kept a a a decent contingent of his starters on the floor at any given time in this game He really hasnt removed them and thrown in a whole new you know refresh And Mallerie has just three points on the game Jakari White top bench performer with eight Carrera hasnt scored On Yenso has only played 13 minutes and scored five points So in terms of a coaching perspective here with under five minutes music to go what do you think coach ODMs looking for in particular You know I think hes looking for and it could be a number of things right He could be looking for what the hustle looks like what the mindset looks like you know still playing smart basketball Its not like a particular play I dont feel like hes looking for I think hes looking for those intangibles You know we talked something about a score that the Cavaliers gives to their their team members right The Cavs score Weve heard about that And thats something thats those things that dont show up in your typical box set box score They may be looking at those to see what his team is producing Are they going to continue to do the things right that are part of the personality of the team Open three for Hall He cashes in and makes this a 9369 game cheering Fricks turnarounds Not enough mustard on it Heres Chance Mallerie one of those reserves Freshman point guard looks up Wants to challenge Van Kman Big size disparity there So it is down low as well Hollandbeck trying to defend Grunlo and hes called for a hold how did the pools and then you take some mid music majors and you put them together and see what you come up with Really entertaining basketball Yeah excited to see that Friday game UVA and Northwestern Wildcats under Chris Collins Theyre 40 to begin the season They beat Depal in Chicago last night Nick Martinelli one of the best scorers in the entire country 20 and a half points per game thus far and he led the Big 10 in scoring last year music So thatll be pretty good challenge for UVA as they step up the competition coming up on Friday Cavaliers will be at home next right after Thanksgiving Friday November 28th against Queens The Royals coming off a 20 win season Joseph on the piouette He continues to fill it up Hes got 19 on 10 shots I hear say hes a pretty impressive scoreer for Marshall I mean hes pretty efficient Hes quick Uh really light of foot feet of foot as you would say or whatever you can get to his shots and and he knocks them down pretty decisively Paul has been pure from beyond the arc Now three for four from three He has 18 points and creeps closer to matching his careerh high of 23 They did not bring Don Hall to Charlottesville to score mostly to be a distributor but has those abilities clearly Yeah Don Hall has multiple assists in all but two games coming from BYU Shot clock inside of five here Oudi over the Grunlow contest Johan tries to bat it Jakari White peels away with it Fires ahead Hall Don hands off Jakari elevates The Army was on their feet They were ready Two and a half to play Joseph lines up the feet and nails it Landed Joseph incredible 22 points for him He is having himself a day trying to do what he can to get some points on the board for his team and hes doing it I mean hes hes getting his shots getting to his spots taking some difficult shots at times Offensive rebound here for Grunlow and the reset for Ditter Fortify pass Grunlow held up Didnt matter Scored the deuce I love a good high low two post players doing what they do best just kind of feeding each other working on the interior Thats just another strength coach ODM has going for his offense That interior play between those two posts I mean you see him up here making the dish down to Gruo whos able to finish through the contact You love the high low play and it just opens up a whole other dimension of the offense The Belgian and the German have really connected so well in the early goingings of their Cavaliers tenures And again Ill give some of that back to the style of play You know overseas the style of play is very much you know some of that high low Its a cheering very pass heavy game sharing the ball And thats something that they share in common They both understand that in each other So thats something coach doesnt have to try to teach They kind of come package ready with that And it was important to get those two guys in the portal because coach ODM brought in a lot of ball dominant guys via the portal right Think about a guy like Malik Thomas 20 point per game scorer last year Sam Lewis 16 points per game Jakari White scored a lot of points 17 per game in North Dakota State So he needed guys who would be selfless Yeah youre steadies But they want Ditter to be assertive And the Cavaliers hit 100 points with two minutes to go The last time Virginia hit 100 was against this squad Marshall about seven years ago The only time a Tony Bennett team hit 100 Big stat there Triple digits They are able to climb the summit and get over the mark And then Gruno is pumped up about that block applause And that just reinvigorated this Cavaliier crowd I dont know if fans really remember the scoreboard showing three digits I dont think they knew that it had that uh ability They could program it that way laughter No its not a mistake Ditter by the way is just fouled out for UVA And tough play there Again there uh tough play by Ditter as in hes been very physical in this game doing what he needs to do to get his team where they need to be cheering All right so Derer does come out of the game with the five fouls and the fans give him a nice round of applause here 23 points six rebounds three assists in 30 minutes work and hes had 20 or more now in three of his first four as a who Desmond Roberts is his replacement wearing the number 13 and Carter Lang is also in Both guys from Charlottesville St Ans Bellefield Products alongside Chance Mallerie So all three of those guys getting a look here Mallerie gets turned aside here Nice play from Bryce Slay Gets it back Puts up a three Cant hit Its a nice box and holds the pivot foot as well Mallerie floats TO THE RIM GERTRO ON THE ELEVATOR Slams it down And the crowd is on their feet They like what they see there over the century mark And now an emphatic dump Virginia Everything is working for the Whos Mallerie So clever A no look Getting it up to Gertrude on the finish Virginia music is over the century mark Well you could change that order to go go whos because Virginia has used the transition game a lot today Chance Mallerie finding Elijah Gertude and the Cavaliers well on their way Its win number four on the season with a minute to go Have 19 fast break points but lets talk about the points in the paint 36 in this game Theyve been getting it done and making their way to the basket those high percentage shots Heres Slay underneath Mallerie just backs up against him and ball jarred Freedll stay with the Whos So youve watched this Virginia team through three games Get to see them live here Anything additional you learned about the Cavaliers today You know nothing really additional but seeing them this is my first time seeing them on the floor you know and they just are very smart team as far as the way they move way they position themselves defensively They make it Its not often that youll see a team that can play a really good defense without running up the fouls Now yes they do have several players that did foul out of this game but that didnt happen back to back to back It was stretched over time So theyre really smart about the way they play uh and very cerebral with the way they play both ends of the floor Crystal one of my main takeaways from Virginias first four and really as we lock in on this game in particular too the pressure that they put on the opponent You look at the foul total for Marshall 28 Thats a huge number And look everyone
