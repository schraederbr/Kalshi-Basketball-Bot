and Kevin ji ready to jump Center BCs won five of the last six in this rivalry before that Notre Dame had won 16 of 17 BC in the gray starts out with it with Chaz Kelly getting another start for Earl Grant and the Eagles at 118 2 six in the ACC same league record as Notre Dame time for second worst only ahead of Louisville its a Kelly turnover Jr kzne the pick in the starting lineup for Notre Dame which looks normal and thats newsworthy because Kevin ji and Carrie boo both didnt play a single second in the second half Wednesday in a loss against Miami and Michael sherbury was not happy with their effort looking for a response open look kesn straight on for three great star for noted aim on both ends of the floor get a turnover one in come down perfect play to execute the first play of the game to get cordz need a open three at top of the keepy for BC we mentioned Chaz Kelly starts again his fifth start of the year claudell Harris is the second leading scorer for the Eagles and yet again they will bring him off the bench trying to get him back on track and Earl Grant said to us today thats a key for them and really overall offensively he wants to see maturity on that end of the floor I think shot selection is part of it this team has played well at times and theyve been real inconsistent on the offensive end theyve been solid defensively but sometimes their inefficiency on the offensive end has hurt them on you know defensively coming off a line at Virginia Tech Quinton post misses the elbow jump shot on his first bid and heres Marcus Burton at the controls for the Fighting Irish at 7 and 12 overall a loss by a dozen here at home against Jim Len and the canes on Wednesday one of the things Errol Grants trying to figure out is this team continues to come out with slow starts kzn no mlon the rebound yeah you notice that the BC in the second half in League games theyre better every time than they on the first half they havent LED at the half of an ACC game yet and thats surprising because we were eight games in now and his team with a player like Quint post here youre just surprising hear stat like that he took the bump from Kevin John Michael shrewbury really wants to see his bigs be physical with the excellent post player for the Eagles Bon turns it over hes had 15 turnovers over the last couple of games with all that responsibility on the rookie shoulders and always to turnover was that D the coach wants him to cut down on that there just you know wasnt anything about physicality easy turnovers easy decision making there just take care to basketball Burton off the post Miss with a floater that comes up short and Prince aligbe the Applause rebound Elite Bay and plays some bully ball going to work on the Freshman booth and the first points for the Eagles great job by League Bay there going inside booth has to give him a little bit more resistance and lo use his length cant get burry so deep in the Applause Music post Burton off the screen from kevi moves it for Boo likes to shoot a lot of Threes very talented freshman was in the ESPN 100 now backs it out to Burton with a shot clock at five matched up with the senior Zachary a handoff and a turnover intended for ji in the Eagles on bur is a little upset with himself though another unforced turnover there just got too deep jumped in the air nowhere to pass to and another careless turnover there just better off getting it on the glass did a great job of penetrating just get it up on the glass you much rather have a Miss field goal than a turnover Al League Bay gave it up for Kelly move for Zachary can knock it down now you always say that with guards just get it up on the glass because its way better than getting stripped out without a shot when you give you when when you penetrate that deep most of the time the Bigs rotating over you give your big a chance to get clean up on the offensive glass and when you turn it over like that you just put yourself at a disadvantage and matching up on the break Kevin J on a face up on Quinton post ja continued to get better on the offensive end of the floor when things break down he has shown the ability at at times during the season to get them on the post and just scoring something that they dont give hit the ball a lot but when they do hes comfortable scoring in the block hes got two of the five for Michel shrewbury seven points combined the first four minutes were off in running in South Ben when youre great your game does the talk in the ACC our speaks volum three of the last eight NCAA championships 99 NCAA tournament wins since 2015 eight NCAA titles in the last 22 years six of the top 30 winning his programs in division one most of any time its not bragging if its true greatness is what we do

station in South Ben for first year head coach Micah Shrewsberry who of course course has followed 23 years of Mike Bray here in Notre Dame talking with Mike Asbury for a while yesterday he feels like this group is coming and the foundation is being built here and his group plays hard and you love what you see from them defensively well a lot of times people always talk about identity but when you watch Notre Dam and you look at the numbers you see their identity theyre a physical team they defend you very well and it starts from there he knows this team will grow theyll get more mature in the offensive end things will pick up there Deon mton who spins one out got it back and follows Junior forward from Georgia coming off 19 10 against the hokes and he stepped it up in League Play he plays so much bigger than the six seven frames says he should and and does it more inside than he think he should amongst the trees he gets in there and cares off space Michael Shrewsberry is dipped into his bench with Julian roer Logan Imes and Braden Shrewsberry of course the coachs son the shooter in the top right of your screen Logan Imes walks with it and thats the third Notre Dame turnover they have turned it over a ton highest turnover rate in the ACC meanwhile BC is one of the best Earl Grant calls it ball care something to monitor in this game one of the reasons Im in the game is because he hadnt turned the ball over coaches getting more comfortable with him last three games he hadnt turned it over and gets in there in his first possession and has a slids his puppies a little bit and turns it over Quinton post is started 0 for four and this is worth noting because in the first meeting that BC 6359 win only three turnovers but in the L Tuesday in blackburg against Virginia Tech Earl Grant said the story of that game was BC turning it over 15 times theyve had games where theyve done so Syracuse games with another one they had countless turnovers and when you dont expect it you hadnt shown that all year he catches you off guard when your team just does such a good job of taking care of the ball mton sticks a three on the pitch back from claudell Harris and a good start for Devin mlon with five points and three rebounds mlon loves ACCC play he just hes got in the conference play most of the time Guys numbers dip not ml he has picked it up Aver 14 Music and8 just catches it off that post rolls inside and post draws so much attention and he able to step in one and hes doing it inside and out big numbers his last seven games highlighted by the homecoming performance for the Georgia native 30 points a career high in the win against Georgia Tech heres brayon Shrewsberry the Sharpshooter whos been hot from long range recently with post entry for Kevin ji got to get it up and a push on Quinton post and that is two on Quinton Post in the first 6 minutes were talking about Deon mlon last seven hes averaging 14 and8 and he makes 23 of his shots I mean he just does it inside and out and again its he did he does a great job when Post in the game and then now we got to monitor that because now post picks up his second foul but when post gets in inside hes able to face you on the perimeter and knock down three as you see and then hes hes in interchangeable with post sometimes he likes his match up theyll post mlock the inside and put post on the threepoint line Zachary poked it away from Shrewsberry and is blocked by by Tay Davis on a chase down Mason Matson got to the loose ball but couldnt stick the jumper its great effort to run that down Zachary thought he had an uncontested layup Imes to the corner and Roper comes up short and then a foul on Davis well two big fouls on Quinton post so with him on the bench Dave Davis the chase down on Jaden Zachary does a great job timing in it get to it on the way up good Hustle by guys you see there its five guys back though D wants to force BC to score in the half court dont want to give him any easy buckets great effort there to chase that chase that shot down and block it from behind see post sitting with two now Tay Davis versatile 69 guard hes picked up two for the Fighting Irish as well well look you Char there look for Zachary to go on a post and try to post up the smaller guard in Burton with post on on the bench shot clock at five for Claude L Harris the Charleston Southern transfer off Target to start and a rebound for Carrie Bo BC has to watch it I mean that the last two possessions even after the block I thought Madson could have brought that back out they had a fresh clock these Sho shoots have fall away and Harris follows up there with a contested midrange jumper well you talked earlier about shots C part of that offensive maturity that Earl Grant was talking to us about pregame in the locker room rooper tried to slip a pocket pass for Matt Sona hey four more college basketball games highlight our ESPN schedule today but were featuring these three third ranked North Carolina takes on Florida State at 2 Eastern then its Clemson against number 12 Duke and then at 6 Eastern sixth rank Kentucky at full strength finally takes on Arkansas a Sonic Blockbuster on the ES n app as well now how about some of the big games in the ACC Carolina to the tuck in Tallahassee teams right at the top of the ACC you see Carolina is perfect theyve got the best defense in the conference but Florida state is a different team then early and Florida State was winning that game in Dean Smith Center and Carolina reversed it was much pressure as Florida State applies it was Carolina that put the full court pressure on FSU and got back in that game and P pull away late Florida state did not have Primo Spears nor cam Corin in that first game at the Smith Center well here in South Ben its VC by two and Jaden Zachary adds to the lead with his first points third leading scorer for the Eagles the veteran guard who is BC basketball in the words of his head coach yeah hes a really physical guard and you love to see him knocking down threes hes only shooting 30 on the year but his size advantage over bur will allow him to post up as well and thatll be critical this first half with post being on the bench early with two fouls and at the other end he was very physical with Burton in the second half of that first meeting after Burton was hot in the first 20 minutes kesn tough shot no and BCs got it up by five on an 80 run and Notre Dames Gone without points for about 4 and 12 minutes now Madson known for his shot from Deep doing a great job of a durable hand off getting that shot the guards I know the name are going under the screen Booth swirls one out only 29 from three and Michael shrewbury said to us yesterday struggling with his shot but they want the Freshman to stay confident you got to take that I mean its just a great job of penetrating kicking out the top of the keys wide open and you take good shots like that your percentage would go up Harris slipped it for Armani Mighty coming off maybe his best game in a BC uniform and he drew a foul so BC on an 80 run C by Jaden Zachary from long Music range all right Im a guy who

schools in the Music Music country Music Music first meeting between these teams this year was less than two weeks ago and The Holy War in Chestnut Hill and Marcus Burton came out hot in the first half and Notre Dame built a lead as large as it dozen because Quinton post had been quiet Jadon Zachary had a big game though for the Eagles spurred them in the second half and then Quinton post took over late for Boston College in a 63 59 win against Notre Dame and Michael Shrewsberry said the BC turned up the pressure and in large part it was the matchup youre talking about Zachary against Marcus Burton I mean Zacharys a physical guard hes a hes a really strong compact guard and Burtons a smaller guy hes quicker but experienced guard as you expect he used his physicality sped up Burton a little bit and he turned it over a few times and Burton got it going early but it was the defensive charge in the second half by BC led by Zachary that got them back in the game and eventually held on until they want until post took over nice match just ear another possession for the Eagles I mean its a 54lb difference yeah between Zachary and Burton whos listed at a buck 66 with Zachary at 220 well its important for Burton to get on the move you know you cant be so stationary even with the ball in your hands get him off your body cuz once he gets into you its just physical Advantage right now going for Zachary well heres Notre Dame at the controls offensively just five points in 9 minutes and theyve gone five plus minutes you see without anything since that Kevin ji jumper Tate Davis is playing with two fouls you want buron cant be tentative had a couple turnovers early just be aggressive with the ball see hes jumping in the air there to make that pass andne couldnt hit it and a rebound to Prince Al Bay sometimes when youre struggling with confidence as you turning the ball over he has to you know you dont want to have the careless turnovers but stay aggressive this team needs him to be aggressive a league Bay not known for his threepoint shot kzne clears it and here is buron lets see if hes more aggressive here he is scoreless freshman Guard from just down the road in Mishawaka out of pen High School averages 16 a game J working on Mighty with a spin move to the Baseline and that doesnt go and the Notre Dame drought continues up near 6 minutes Mighty has given some really big minutes no pun intended here he is underneath and he got hacked and fouled Armani Mighty the sophomore from Toronto coming off a season High six points against Virginia Tech gave him 10 really good minutes he was offensive rebounding he had really athletic catches underneath and Earl Grant says hes a developmental big and hes trending in the right direction well he changes things because the offense now shifts toward the guards hes a guy that wants to in pick and rolls theyre not going to really throw it to him in a post to go oneonone as much but as you can see there put him in ball screens he catches it good hands Good Feet catching on the roll where he gets to finish in the REM use some of his athleticism and we post picking up those two fouls early hes down hes going to get extended minutes he knows that gives him a chance to stay involved in the game Kei leading over on the Notre Dame bench being tended to so its Zona kesn Burton rooper and Shrewsberry the five for the Irish Braden Shrewsberry shut off there by claudell Harris and now Zona with a shot clock inside of 10 dribble hand off for Burton off the bounce kick out kesn and kesn got fouled great drive there by Burt hit gaps hes got Shooters on the floor theyre spreading the floor out zone is going to be the primary roll Guy Burton hits the Gap there kicks it out right in front of the bench and its good call good CL got to be able to land got to be able to land its good call on the foul it was not much argument there from the BCs bench so the junior Southbend native and second leading scorer Jr kesn hey two of the top teams in the SEC Square Off in our ESPN Sunday afternoon womens basketball matchup Tennessee takes on Old Miss at the Pavilion with coverage starting at 3 Eastern well JR kesn good on the first couple snapping a 90 run for Boston College both of these teams we talked about that both of these teams have the tendency to go through the gap Music of not scoring the basketball I mean they both teams are really good defensively but they need Burton in this they need post to kind of get help them over their offensive struggles during the course of a game its BC by three coming up on nine to go in the first half mlon with a tough pass to handle for Prince Elite B and just the second Eagles turnover the match up are difficult now theyre going to try to pick matchups with post out and look for whoevers Burtons guarding theyre going to try to put him in a post if its Zachary who even hires one of these guards bigger guards theres Burton trying to shake Mason Matson kzns got six of the eight for the Irish Matson got a piece of it and it does stay with not to them with 11 to Music Applause Music shoot just a drive Music there she held on to it a little bit and now Burton gets it into Matt Zona he can step out and shoot it from Long Range Shrewsberry dropped mton gave it up to Burton nearly got caught in the air now Shrewsberry cant connect zone of the offensive rebound Roper to the corner kesn tied at 11 kesn knows theres no hesitation with them thats what youre talking about when you hear Earl Grant talk about offensive maturity there roer has that one more is it over to the corner from a good shot to a better shot nine of the 11 for Jr kesn in a breakout season tough shot Zachary falling away thats the shot that he means right there youre getting double team get off it get a better shot not dribble out P pull up midrange out of a post uh trap great job by Zone to keep an extra possession here Roba has it one mores it pesy with the corner Applause three Zona moves it for Shrewsberry again an open look kesn misfires offensive rebound again kesn right back in for two and Notre Dame leads great job by Notre Dame on the offensive end moving about basketball so when you know when a shots going up even if you dont make it thats when your other guys know to go to the offensive glass so theyre doing it when you know its going up instead of a quick shot not only do you have a shot at making it but you can also offensive rebound it mlon though Irish shot an 80 run the last two minutes and Jr kesn is cooking risky pass tipped Away by claudell Harris well Jr kesn had a huge game against Virginia couple of games back for Notre Dame he is hot having a another huge first half today well hes knocking down a couple shots hes got to feel good

deal out of it because it is Music bigger early start in South Bend for fans of all ages and theyre watching Jr kesn get hot for the Irish guy who his first two years here scored a total of 11 points he is averaging 10 points per game this year and hes got 11 of the 13 in a lowscoring first half he has he teammates have done a good job too of getting him the ball and hes a guy that straight line drive but needs the ball movement and teammates to help get him open and theyve looking for offense theyve gone to him here first half early and often went to St Joe High School just six minutes down the road on Notre Dame a finished his career as the Countys alltime leading scorer and waited his turn here Marcus Burtons got his first points of the day he does hes great midrange shot there hes got to stay ready that time he came off the screen found himself just a little bit of room I dont think he came off looking to score but had a moment and able to finish Kelly to mton nice feed off the dribble drive so Quinton post still sidelined with two fouls hes been out since the 1421 Mark you good with keeping him on the bench here well theres no re to put no reason to put him out there now and still in this game its only a one possession game right now and can completely flip the game in the second half if he comes out now picks up his third Grant typically very lenient when guys have two in the first half according to kenpa Roper on a drive a little bit out of control and heres BC down by two coming up on six to go first half Donald Han Jr Off the Bench sticks to three this will be a game of runs and both teams have made runs early on and BC finally answers their streaking Burton around the corner Shrewsberry on the drive pulls up too strong another offensive rebound for Notre Dame kesn with two more and hes up to 13 the ball is just finding him now its amazing when you get to the right spots and sometimes youre just rewarded for just being where youre supposed to be spacing wasnt good early in the possession and but NE he finds himself on the weak side ball find turn over as mighty couldnt make the catch on the entry from Chaz Music Kelly again good penetration there by Shrewsbury misses the floater and tell you guys rebound by two hands they dont but just finds himself create space in a post and great job finishing over Almighty hes hes a talented shot blocker down there good job carving out space finishing over Kelly is tied up and he gets fouled by Julian roer so a couple of teams at 2 and six in ACC action both teams both head coaches they feel like theyve been close in so many games BC all six League losses by 11 points or fewer and for no name I mean you can easily make a case they could have started not that they did or would have but could have started 4 one in League Play both of these teams are are going to be games because theyre you see the effort here diving on the floor oh theyre theyre just theyre just fighting look at this theyre going to fight and that the effort right there by both teams is why theyre going to be in games because their identities are the defensive end of the floor we might have to go to in you know inant replay there to see the fumble here this is a fumble I mean theres no wrestling program here in their name anymore but these guys are on the M Freeman would be impressed with that thats a drill you do you roll it out and see who comes up with it in a pile he look at the bodies jumping all over the floor oh and thats what you get from Julian roer he is a guy that Micah shrew will go to war with traveling called on Donald hand and a fourth BC turnover after we told you they only at three in the first meeting Julian roer is a ton of fun to watch Michael shrewbury has been telling his team this week trying to figure out who I can lose with and he told his team I can lose with Julian roer because when its time to roll up your sleeves and fight somebody I know what Im getting from him one thing these guys are learning about about playing basketball you can lose the game but you got to win the fight and thats essentially what coach Shrewsbury is telling his guys Logan Imes with just his fourth Collegiate three hes starting to come around you can see hes forcing coach shrewbury to play him he had one turnover early but prior to that like I said he only turned it over he had turn it over three previous three games and an ability to knock down open shots and take some pressure off Burton hes a key guy thats earning minutes and theres no the name rotation Booth blocked to League Bay shot clock doesnt Reet and it is another BC walking turnover this one on Prince Al League Bay Le B the double team is surprised him and see Quinton post coming back in the game for a quick push here but the offense have been to the floor they starting to struggle with the turnovers here and Grant wants to get his starters back in the game is now the right time you said you okay with keeping on when yeah hes been sitting for so long and hadnt played a ton of minutes so you got to get him back out there and this is where a trust is earned with a veteran guy you respecting him to not fou hes only played five minutes of the game sat the last 10 minutes of game action on the nose Burton lost his handle and the arrow will keep it at this end of the floor with the Fighting Irish this has not been an offensive Masterpiece I dont think he we we didnt expect it to be I mean these are two of the better defensive teams in the ACC they have their offensive challenges and this is going to be a rock fight first game was 6359 and I expect this game to be right around that same Edge I mean right in the 50s youre playing broadcasting Bingo you can check off Rock fight youre not going to like I said both teams are really good defensively but Notre Dame is just not going to allow you to play the a fast pace right now theyre going to dictate the pace with their defense and when you play two teams that identity is built on the defensive end of the floor youre going to get a game like this and its about who make the fewest amount of mistakes you can live with Miss shots a double ond Quinton post again just back into the game after sitting for 10 minutes DC down by four on the Baseline thats two for mton whos got nine points and is really lifting the Eagles in the first half if Im concerned for noted aim thats the biggest difference there just multiple options of when you have the full compliment of players Boston College has the ability to put it in the post and force double teams GI and hows post working out of double teams and sharing it oh it its its vital because you need to when a double team you Boston College need to do a better job of for a team to struggle in the offensive end do a better job of of attacking out of the double team hand always confident with his shot and ims The Rebound with the Irish up by two inside a three to go in the first Applause half times the freshman in state products who was headed to Penn State before the coaching change and Micah shrewsburys new destination you got to go flat H hes Birds got to attack him drive the paint dont settle with a mismatch against the sevenfooter kzn has missed his last couple and post the rebound post just backed off of him I thought Burton could have dribbled himself into a rhythm pull up Kelly to the corner mlon wants to back down carry booth and Devin mcglockton is rolling in this first half great job by mlon not settling for the open three knew Booth was closing out on him knew he had the physical advantage and backed him inside and shot the baby hook over 11 and four for Devin mlon Barton off Target hand pushes nearly a carry got to see it early they have post inside yeah double teams coming he spins away from it Burton digging down and its a jump ball the arrow keeps it at this end with the Eagles when we come back Rock fight baby out Music when youre great your game does the talk

stepped onto the floor Saturday and immediately put together about a 4minute stretch as good as you will see in this sport it will be and it be interesting to see if that young Kentucky Team figures it out on the road theyve had their struggles most recently the loss at South Carolina in a court storming in Columbia shot clock winding down on Deon mlon and Logan Imes battles against armman Mighty as we are inside of 90 seconds to go in this first half in South Bend with Randolph childis Im Mike Monaco in a 202 first half Matt Sona for three I guarantee you that wasnt on The Scouting Report there no its seventh of the Season senior who is stuck around and now finds himself in the biggest role of his career great job there called by shrewbury coming out of time out getting him the shot knowing armman Mighty was going to be sitting in the paint trying to protect the rim claudell Harris again for second straight game coming off the bench Chaz Kelly answers good job that ass Kelly hes has all the talent in the world and its been fun to see his development and his involvement in his BC lineup hes forced forced himself into the rotation and actually getting started the last couple of games hes taking advantage of it sophomore Guard from Houston 7 Seconds separate game clock and shot clock Marcus Burton springloaded and blocked saved by The Eagles 7 seconds for Jaden Zachary off the bounce Zachary lost his footing got it to mton who comes up short so he head the halftime locked at 23 and a slugfest in the holy war on the hardwood in South Ben TW early foul here right its got to be solid this team needs him on the offensive end of the floor hes their identity on the offensive end of the floor and you almost wish he concede a basket before he committed a foul here but theyre switching five so he gets switched on to Burton and we get an offensive foul that is called on Kev ji who had the mismatch with Jaden Zachary as the eagle switch one through five as you said yeah theyre switching everything in the ball screen and great job by Zachary there and see the left arm of ji go up top and hit Zachary across the head we knew it would be a physical keing defensive minded Notre Dame is rated as the second best defense in the ACC in League Play only behind Carolina a league they missed it in close and the Irish clear it into the hands of Burton leading score at 16 a game only had two in the first half and now Jai turns on post great job attacking post there takes it One Direction spins off gets the angle and finishes its great job there what you see from Kevin ji and Carrie Booth who again Wednesday got benched didnt play at all in the second half and Michael Shrewsberry came back with them today yeah he got their attention and ji has to he has to be the physical guy inside the tone Setter Booth is a little bit more knowing his assignments taking OB shots when they there and just being more active with his length first points from Quinton post TI us up at 25 rooper KES on the Baseline cut KES doing a great job today just knowing when to cut when the Music space just good feel for for the game right now the ball is just finding him guy who in his first two years here played a grand total of 22 minutes local guy came in in the same class as his old buddy Blake Wesley Mike he wasnt on a Scouting Report no coming in here when we played him he wasnt on a Scouting Report I mean he was just a guy that you like hey if he came in youd give a signal but didnt play at all and its amazing with confidence and opportunity does for someone told us how appreciative he is of this opportunity and sticking around South Bend through a coaching change at all post on a reverse that rolled up thats the difficult thing about when you get double teamed inside you know lets hope he continues to post up inside and not just continues to go to the perimeter game and cuz the them definitely him and the post will help his teammates rer two strong and then post cleared out ji and post wanted a foul on Kevin Jai as those two bang like they did in the first meeting when they played very physically especially in the first half of that game Jai really got Quinton post out of sorts well hes upset he hadnt scored yet and Jai has went at him a couple times and scored on him and you better believe as a big guy you know thats you know you keeping track of that that battle like coaches do kesn tried to get post up in the air and couldnt finish yeah post is just fustrated he just hadnt been able to get it in get the ball in the basket preseason second team ACC choice is 20 points away from a th000 for his career the sevenfooter from Amsterdam sets the screen for Chaz Kelly dogged by Marcus Burton now Zachary shot clock winding down and Julian roer commits the foul on Jaden Zachary and what post can do too is just rely on his teammates his one basket he got was a penetration and drop off and he puts himself in ball screens and lets his teammates kind of get going with z seems to be able to get in the Music paint another basket like that can get him going so 17 in the first meeting for post and now up to four today ties it up at 27 great Baseline out of bounds call there using a guard to screen Music Music him Burton trying to get it from Ji instead still with it 20 seconds into The Possession and now Roper the Northwestern transfer originally from Detroit probing the Baseline and S Away by Zachary with 3o4 left to shoot doing a good job with poster keeping him in the paint hes clogging it up allowing everything theyre trying to pin the ball on the sidelines and when it gets in the middle then theyre switching middle ball screens but everything else on the sideline they trying to pin it on the sideline kzne from the sideline drives in now Booth RIS es air balls that one and itll stay at this end but the shot clock had reset and so the officials will come together here Keith Kimble and Justin Porterfield want to chat about Applause it so 34 left as Burton puts it in it was an airball out of the corner yeah you see it it already reset to 30 so that presumably belongs to Boston College yeah I think Keith Kimble there was looking to go the other way I think he was thinking it was Boston Colleges ball and they both had mixup on I just want to make sure they get the call right well theyll look at it well fill you in on

Music Music for Music a a little juice here inside purcel Pavilion and some physicality as we told you to expect in this game second meeting in two weeks between DC and Notre Dame and Mah Shrewsberry was begging for this yesterday at practice he said to us Im going to see if were out there cracking boys or not he he has hes got to love what he sees I mean hes challenged this guys to be physical on both ends of the floor defensively but also offensive and setting your screens and rolling and Silling and I can tell you this these coaches dont care what the score is as long as you win by one point it can finish 2827 youre going to take that win and run with it two coaches at programs who are building year three for Earl Grant youre one of course for Micah Shrewsberry it was a shot clock violation by the way on Notre Dame as we expected so BC with it first four plus minutes out of halftime Chaz Kelly out of the corner and BC has the guys they have the shooting ability to get going guys like Chaz Kelly and Harris and post hadnt got going they have guys just seven points combined from the top three scorers for the eagles post Harris and Zachary another offensive rebound run out by kesn for the fight Irish off the give go kzne tried to bounce back for giant a kick with 12 left to shoot coach shrewbury telling kesn there to watch that pass is better off getting it up on the glass I think sometimes these guards are getting deep in the paint theyre trying to force passes that are not Music there and then you got to ask yourself what is your beard going to do when you throw it to him so sometimes just better to get it up on the glass Zachary being physic Co with Burton and now Braden Shrewsberry hes been scoreless as well 0 for three including two attempts from long range back for Shrewsberry first points great quick release there great job by Burton finding Shrewsberry the teams are starting to adjust to him now even for shrewbury hes got to do a really good job of when they chase him down hes got to be ready to put it on the deck and drive it mlon triying to muscle it up and here come the Irish saw the not on Shrewsberry averaging better than 13 a game his last five and Burton draws a foul a big day over on ESPN in the college hoops world how about these three games number three North Carolina perfect in the ACC in Tallahassee at two Eastern against Florida State Clemson at Cameron havent won there since 1995 and six ranked Kentucky against Arkansas Duke got Mark Mitchell and Jeremy roach both back in the midweek action against Louisville so a second game for them and Clemson hasnt played since we saw him in Tallahassee beating the noes last weekend they were dominant against the Noles they were physical they were tough but theyre going into a place where pit just got a win you dont you dont go on the Cameron to get many wins and so theyre going to need a equally as difficult and tough performance to get one there Burton and post swap buckets as the top scores on each team start to heat Music up great sign of BCC post just seeing the ball go in here he up to six points all here since halftime Michael Shrewsberry directing things with his freshman point guard Marcus Burton at the controls with post on him he didnt bite kesn shot clock winding down and Jr kesn had it online but too strong its great defensive possession there extra pass for Matson yes Applause sir great defensive possession there by BC and forced a difficult shot pushed it in transition before noted a was able to set their defense get to wide openen three from the right hand of Mason Matson backup guard senior from Minnesota connecting on 46 from long range Burton draws a Chaz Kelly foul after the triple spurred by the defense thats a great job on the defensive end of the floor there you got four guys inside Chaz Kelly throws it ahead just pushes Force rotation you want more theres no one there to rotate they come over late thats what you want to do against a really good defensive team is you get possessions like that where you get to push Tempo and try to score before they set youre struggling as as well shots like that wont come around when their defense is set so you got to be more aggressive in transition first meeting getting out in transition played a big part in BCs comeback win from down a dozen in the second half two weeks ago Kate Davis gets fouled by Quinton post and so thats three on the BC stud 1241 to go in the second half that ones on quit and post there you cant allow midal midal penetration its closing out if he forces some baseline hed have help right there you cant get beat middle theres no help middle was impossible to help weak side guys got to push away to get to the shooters on the other Applause side I would almost rather post let that go than commit that foul how do you manage it now three with about 13 minutes to go hes played a lot in this half and whether you give him his normal BL you can do it now just to remind him of Hey dont pick up a quick one here but hes involved because youre switching five hes going to be involved in every play now because youre going to run your offense room on the other end so Tate Davis connects on Ball and we got a onepoint game in the second half between BC and Notre Dame post couldnt knock down the Applause triple Imes saved it but turned it over not on the same page with Tade Davis initiating for the Fighting Irish in the half court and post takes it himself and got cou and well head to the free throw line yeah thats part of his game that he has I think with Zona just cant match up with him on if they give him the ball in the pitch post or in the high post and allow him to attack off the bounce thats a difficult ask of Zona pinch post means what for the free throw line when he flash up at the free throw line and catch it just a great job there hes driving little hesitation move as much as a sevenfooter can hesitate but he has that in his skill set sometimes when teams who press Boston College theyll often put the ball in post hands and force other teams centers to come up and outside of Florida State I dont know if any other team has a center that comes and press you whats his Pro say again whats his Pro future he shits the ball well from three you look at his percentage I dont think he shoots it enough and lets see if what his percentage is stay the same I think it be dictated on how well he shoots the basketball as as a sevenfooter 44 from three well because hes not Tak yeah hes not a high volume guy but there is a role for a guy like that because hes plays in drop coverage hes not an athletic Above the Rim guy but offensively his skill set passing and doing everything else is definitely an NBA level skill set Michael shrew didnt like the offensive Val on Julian roer BC by three on the road when youre great I may add of St Joe High School great kicks all over all with a personal touch Carrie Booth from Colorados got the mountains on his Julian Roper from Detroit hes got the Detroit Tigers on his but look at m a shrews berries it says building a culture on one side of the shoe and has yes an actual basketball stitched onto his sneaks nice where are ours man I dont know why didnt you get it I like youre hanging in the Raptors man with a microphone picture hanging in next to all these great basketball players its uh suits and sneakers coaches versus cancer so we got good kicks all over the place Harris got fouled at The Rim what would you get on yours if you could have a personal touch on your shoes crossover maybe no I dont know yet that would be something Id have to think about wouldnt wear him a lot Music but shout out to Jerry Barker by the way hes a senior in high school designing these thats awesome you doing senior year of high school I wasnt doing that no anything close to this just trying to get by trying to figure out where I was going to go to school that was about it he ended up at a great private school by the way I did priv school education I did took advantage of it yeah hes the great Randolph children Im merely Mike Monaco BC leads by four and a long way to go in this second half and a rivalry matchup dominated recently by Boston College five of the last six Marcus Burton so good at that getting to his spot in the midrange thats his game uh the only one hes second one he got to like that and on Q he knocked it down Zachary again lost his footing but finds Deon mlon whos been massive for BC in this game hes up to 13 forcing the switch gets a smaller guard on him goes right insides their spacing post he provides that ability with his ability to shoot the ball from three Burton gets bumped by Zachary and then mton buried him Music late pretty good looking crossover from Marcus B yeah hes so quick this was part of what they practiced game plan was clear out aside he snatches and he gets to the rim or gets to his midrange but if you see there hes cleared out of side for him to attack and both teams looking now to take advantage of the switching after Miami was here the other day Jim Lena said that Marcus Burton is one of the three or four best freshman in the country hes got a lot on his plate Zachary cops It Up In transition yeah Zachary trying to push Tempo teams now both teams are starting to see the ball go through the net theyre trying to push Tempo take advantage of this moment Zachary there just got a little ahead of himself with multiple Defenders back waiting on him talk about how much responsibility Marcus Burton has the highest usage rate of anyone in the ACC what percentage of possessions in total for a team that hes a part of that hes responsible for shooting or assisting trb and you can see now hes conscious of trying to get other guys going and as the as the scoring around him picks up then the game will be come even easier for him but now hes got to pick it up on the defensive end theyre doing a great job of trying to put him in a post he was late getting out to Claude L Harris who knocks down his first shot of the day yeah they tried to rotate from the wing and take the post and kick him out so they couldnt post him up and he couldnt get there in enough time DC by five largest lead for either team in this game is six just past the Midway Point second half Burton driving thish shot fake Shrewsberry knocks it down its great quick release by Shrewsberry side steps to get away from the defense and gets it off knocks down his second three of the afternoon well that was much needed Notre Dame nson moves it Harris again answers claudell Harris thats the communication issues that theyre dealing with for not the Dame on the defensive end of the floor theyre trying to put burden in the ball screen and post up not the Dame wants to three man switch it and kick him out and theyve given up six points right here on back to back threes by not communicating on that switch communication on ball screens was a problem for Notre Dame defensively in the first meeting as well especially late against Quinton post or rer went spinning post doesnt bite playing with three and he picks up his fourth foul with 9 minutes to go did a great job initially guarding the ball and he does a good job of moving his feet the mistakes happen when he tries to block the shot just cant cant go down trying to get a block here I mean just a great job just stay there and wall up take away the angle and that would have been a difficult shot for rer to finish anyway kind of falling away with his left hand and now you pick up your four foul when your team offensively looked like they were just starting to get a rhythm knocked down a couple of Threes And hes a big part of that because they were spacing him in the corner what do you think this conversation is hes just reminding him that again theres a lot of minut a lot of time left in this game but player of his level he has to understand he cannot commit that foul and spent way too many valuable minutes in a game like this on the bench with foul trouble Tate Davis returns meanwhile Earl Grant elects to go smaller Prince El League Bay Chaz Kelly just came in out there with Harris Zachary and mlon what do you expect to see from the Eagles here without post try to again Force the switch you see they trying to put Burton inside thats the game plan the leag B fighting for it and BT picks up the foul thats two on Notre Dames point guard now what theyve been trying to do prior to that was the weak side Wing was trying to come inside and kick him out Boston College saw that and sprayed in the corner for threes that time coach shur just told bird just get in there and fight Harris wanted a third from the same spot kesn tried to knock it away but it does stay with Boston College youre seeing more guards go to the offensive glass more than you ever had in the past and Zachary there battling for the offensive rebound where traditionally you you want your point guards back at half court to kind of balance the floor why do we see more of it I think when team struggle offensively youre just trying to fight I mean I dont think its I dont know if he was expecting a shot to go up sometimes youre not expecting that shot to go up there and youre just kind of there waiting on the ball reversal to come Music out m glockton to the offense of glass couldnt save it to a teammate they name down four oh man and Shrewsberry barely avoided the travel banging in his teammate J almost a victim of Friendly Fire there by his own teammate forc him to travel like me and you BL ey at the hotel heres Harris on the run out plays it in claudell Harris starting to cook hes up to nine and mic Shrewsberry needs a timeout Claude Del Harris is powering by Austin College up a half dozen going back and forth with Braden Shrewsberry the offense is picking up guys are getting hot from behind the threepoint line there shrewbury knocks down one and BC comes back knocks down one got a game here now BC up six I bought three of the same jacket to get the fourth free I subscribed to get a deal on these memory

up by six on Notre Dame in South Bend Indiana and Marcus Burton just turned it over trying to split a ball screen and split Two Eagles what did you see here and why is he out of the game well he tried to do that early in the year he got away with it and Shrewsbury told him he wanted to stop doing it you can see him in the background immediately going to the bench that was a no no he started telling him just string it out too many turnovers committed him trying to do that move and his coach is upset with him and he told him not to do it coming out and he tried it there and costly turnover right there and Michael shb told us 10 or 12 of those already this year finally got to a point where they told Marcus Burton youre not allowed to split ball screens like that you can see its a habit and habits are hard to break much needed three for Notre D with Burton out and its Braden Shrewsberry fellow freshman who delivers again and hes got 11 so difficult when dribble hand off of him because even when youre switching if Im guarding the ball I get Im under the ball screen I mean the ball handler and its tough to get there he gets that off so quick heres claudell Harris who just slipped and now his pass goes off the feet of Chaz Kelly and its a turnover for the Eagles as they still play without Quinton post their star sidelined with four fouls now this is the tradeoff now with Burton hes out hes the guy you got to give the ball to to create for himself and others and hes not out there now who takes up that slack looks like Braden Shrewsberry gives it up kesn offt Target batted around

this is just spectacular the stars have never been brighter thats our move womens college hoops on ESPN and ABC Earl Grant has been trying to settle down his second leading scorer Claud Harris by bringing him off the bench these last two games hes went on a three game stretch there where he was struggling and now late in the game last game hes starting to find his rhythm and when you let the offense come to you you dont force shots to think youre shoot a better percentage and hes starting to find himself here in the second half ear Grant told us before the game that its a balance for him in coaching Claude L Harris because hes so talented because he is such a shot maker who was woken up here in the second half that hes got a balance giving him the freedom to do his thing but also looking for shot selection to be what he wants well I think the biggest thing in watching them on film and they agreed with me when we when I saw it was just him taking balanced shots if hes on balance hell make a high percentage of shots sometimes he gets into a rhythm and when you have that ability to take as many shots in the freedom I say sometimes you can shoot yourself into a slump and I think thats what he did hes figuring it up so he and post now have combined for 19 in the second half after again they were both scoreless as you saw in the first half Marcus Burton is still on the bench for Notre Dame yeah at some point youre going to see hes going to have to try to get him back in there just dont have anybody else that can create Shrewsberry taking tough follow a like that and it is a turnover and a traveling call on Jr kesn hey NBA Rivals week rolls out today on ABC with the Heat Knicks at 3 Eastern followed by the Sixers and Nuggets then we cap the night at 830 Eastern 530 Pacific with the Warriors hosting the Lakers and it all starts with NBA Countdown at 230 Eastern well Birds back in the game you know when you when youre in this situation and you do something wrong on the coach and he takes you out its kind of like a kid when you there it is hes making himself invol getting involved in this game reminding coach they cant play without him but its like when you get in trouble as a little kid and your parents send you to the room and you make so much noise in your room theyre like just go back outside get just get out of my face just go just go play just get away from me and you you cant keep him out hes just hes a competitor and hes made some mistakes but he brings too much energy to this team now Jaden Zacharys third turnover this half just a great job there running through the passing Lane if he would have dumped that he would have brought the house down mhm Superstar freshman guard at 16 points per game third best among freshman in the entire country hes the one guy when the offense breaks down you can set screens to dictate the matchup now hes on Harris and then he just goes Burton off the bounce harrisan right with him Kelly in transition lays it in thats the unforced turnover there anything we talk about just get it to the glass Applause all created by the defense of Claude L Harris hes had a huge second half now on both ends and Kelly knocked it away another Burton turnover and then Burton commits his third foul yeah hes going to come out now back to back turnovers there its just he has so much responsibility hes got to learn that its going to come its going to happen and I know hes frustrated and disappointed but Michael Shrewsberry sat him down this week in a film session and said about the turnovers look we can show you how teams are defending you but Michael Shrewsberry said to him I cant coach both teams so meaning opponents are going to adjust what theyre doing against you defensively over the course of the game and you have to learn to adapt in game on the Fly what hes going to learn Mike is leave the mistake in the pass so he turns it over the previous possession so instead of coming and being aggressive this next ball screens hes really passive and then that snowballs and he creates another turnover there and if you dont fix that youll find yourself like in quick sand and just you just get so timid and this team needs him to stay aggressive he just needs to just be mindful to take care of the basketball and remember just get it on the glass just get shot up on the glass and let your teammates rebound it so BCs up by seven biggest lead for the Eagles approaching four minutes to go theyre trying to sweep Notre Dame this season here on the road Tate Davis got Post in the air and Quinton post has fouled out of this game with 403 to go Eric Grants going to have to figure out a way with post to communicate with him and tell him hes got to concede basket were at a critical point here with BC that if he had given him and been in a game for a couple of minutes they could have just seal the game and now he fouls out its going to give this no game Team Hope does a great job and hes moving his feet well but he leaves his feet you dont want to foul Tay Davis there hes not a scorer hes just putting his head down trying to make a play Force Team just wall up he scores over top of you youre seven feet its okay you just dont need that and you dont need the Roper one when when hes on the basine back those are just fouls where initially he does a good job defending it he keeps his feet in front of the ball and that time he left his feet the other time he tried to block it and his impact on the game because its not just for his team its what happens schematically from the other team like teams are scheming him and his versatility creates offense for the other so lets see now Burtons not in the game so they cant run their ball screen action to post up bur so lets see where they go with the ball here two big free throws from Tay Davis have trimmed the BC lead to five inside a four to go in South Applause B Chaz Kelly gets to the cup and is fouled by Braden Shrewsberry Kellys giv a lift hes got eight points in this game BCs up by five trying to win on the road against Micah Shrewsberry in M Dame if you love to travel Capital 1 has a rewards credit card

go in South Bend the holy war and a game reset for you DC has shot it well in the second half their stars have arrived in this second half after Deon mcglockton was huge in the first half Braden Shrewsberry Has Lifted Notre Dame from long range and it was JR kesn who got them going in the first down yeah theyre looking for someone now in the second half Burton struggled with turnovers hes back out of the game and dont know if hell get back in and the question becomes where do they look for offensive on the other than four bra shury usually more catch and shoot guys and between he and corni one of those two guys is going to have to lift the load here the last 43 340 in the game well chz Kelly misses on the first fivepoint BC Applause Lee Kelly splits at the strike froud was upset man they were going to get some nachos had he missed that one that applies to you too I should have you know its a bum on Kelly and that is the 17 foul on BC so the one in one coming for Logan IM and now you start to think about Notre Dames free throw shooting as well team that really struggled at the line at ACC plays 68 thats third worst in the league and in ACC losses only 58 free throw shooter but a whole lot better today well the think for Chaz Kelly hes a young player himself you dont want to commit a foul that early in the shot clock you look at the lineup theres no the D team is struggling a score and you foul a dribble or one dribble across half court to go into bonus and essentially give them two points Logan Imes was good on Applause Music both Zachary Al Bay Harris Kelly and mton the five for Earl Grant with Quinton post having fouled out Harris came up short mton the offensive rebound and stick back great job by mton there thats what you tell your bigs at times he sets the screen he gets the switch you may not get it in the post but you got to kick that guards tail on the glass and get the rebound and he did so its a big possession Music there team High 15 for mton Tay Davis got fouled first on the drive offensive rebounding a big key here from Deon mcglockton mcglockton has rer on him in the garden they didnt post him up but did a great job of battling tracing the ball in the air he gets it off the rim tis it to himself and just goes back up hes a matchup nightmare for these guards to switch keep off the glass guy who had his sight set on D1 football at one point Tate Davis has been good at the line see CH Kelly telling them there next time they switch Ill throw it back and probably throw it to you on the post its great job for Notre Dame getting these last four points off the free throw line it stopped the clock for one but its get you in a rhythm if we get into a free throw shooting contest to close the game theyre 12 of 13 at the free throw line in this game hanging around within four of Boston College won the first meeting against notame and Chestnut Hill less than two weeks ago Kelly defended by rer Kelly turns it over roer walk the tight rope ims on the deck and its a timeout called by Notre Dame one of two that was left for the Irish we step aside for 30 that right back to South Ben when youre great your game does the talk in the ACC our speaks volum three of the last eight NCAA championships 99 NC AA tournament win since 2015 eight NCAA titles in the last 22 years six of the top 30 winningest programs in division one most of any kind its not bragging if its true greatness is what we do the ACC a Claude L Harris again coming off the bench today like he did against Virginia Tech when he played a whole lot better and maybe a little more free than the first me against Notre Dame and against Carolina well he starting to see signs of him coming out of it his slump in the Virginia Tech game and started out slow here in the first half but hes picked it up here in the second half I think the biggest question going to be with him is he more comfortable coming off the bench for the team is it better for the team for him starting or coming off the bench looks like that might be the case yeah I mean its it doesnt matter he hes a closer hell be on the floor when it matters its never about who started its more about who finishes hes definitely going to be on the court when its decide time to decide who finishes the game Shrewsberry up a shot F got mlon in the air Shrewsberry spinning and scooping and it rolled out its off the BC and stays with the Fighting Irish down four great footwork there just pivoting unable to finish him Music but Kev ji returns for the Fighting Irish replacing Julian rer meanwhile with 205 left Marcus Burton still sits leading scorer stud freshman has been out since the 426 Mark in a game in which hes turned it over five times kesn got free kesn comes up short had a good look to make it a onepoint game he did everyone was focused on everything all the action coming off the strong side CN pops out weak side action and unable to knock down to three Notre D looking for a stop BC looking to widen the Gap ahead by four a big possession here of the game look for mlon inside in the post there hes got 6 for Julian Roper on him mlon bang it back out to Zachary around the screen Zachary drives kicks extra pass Harris no kzne it looked like it went off the foot of mcglockton and it belongs to Notre Dame with a fck 29 to go Notre Dame just defense and they fight you for the entire 30 seconds unable to secure the rebound but fortunately for them off the foot of mlon and look whos back Marcus Burton being entrusted to return with 90 seconds to go after sitting for the last 257 hes moving Burton off the ball hes putting the ball in Tay Daviss hands theyve done this quite a bit of time throughout the season using it for a dribble hand off there get him going downhill with Kelly chasing Burton to the cup finishes at a foul this is why coach Shrewsbury has so much confidence in this young guy thats a difficult place to be in sitting on a bench not playing great come off the dribble hand off just turns the corner Chumps into mlon and finishes as a chance to make this a point game talked about it right at the start that there might not be a freshman in the country with more responsibility than Marcus Burton and in a day that hasnt gone his way being entrusted to come back and then an offensive rebound Tate Davis off the Miss from Burton and the Irish can Tire take the lead and credit to him and Coach shury coach shury still coaching them hard taking them out with turnovers but in putting the ball in his hand like now telling him go make plays gave it up to kesn shot clock winding down kesn on the Baseline no so the Eagles have it ahead by two final minute and in the hands of Jaden Zachary Now look for the plays where they try to put Burton in the ball screen the four Applause switches and a game in which Quinton post is already fouled out Zachary off the screen Zachary tried to feather one for mlon a league made Dives for it and what do we got a timeout called first by BC and Micah Shrewsberry does not like that he has every right to be upset I wasnt sure they had sole possession of the ball when they call a timeout there

diving for it and was granted a timeout out what did you think of the call it was a quick whistle now hes probably getting to Im assuming hes calling timeout win I I dont know when he ever solely possesses the ball and its a fortunate call for BC you saw Earl Grant motioning for it right away and Alig was the first one to get on to it but then Julian rooper had jumped in as well yeah but you can see when do he totally possess initially when they both dive on the floor you see rer has a hand on it as well I mean look he goes down like Davis is in there initially I mean Davis and then rer comes along and thats you saw Earl Grant was right there getting it called in the ear of Isaac Barnett so stays with BC 357 to go eagles with possession seven left to shoot theyre up by two what do you think Earl Grant draws up here I think anything he got his two guys on one side of the floor and I think either mlon or some type of back screen or getting him the ball to Zachary coming out two timeouts for Earl Grant with his Eagles on the road one for Micah Shrewsberry Arrow points to the Eagles in the final minute into Zachary defended by eyes Zachary goes spinning on the step through gets the roll Jaden Zachary just as we say tried to get mlock into the back screen didnt work put the ball to Zachary hands and thats what you expect out of your experienced guard to go make a play for you and then Micah Shrewsberry didnt like what he saw so he takes the time out will bring Braden his son into the game with not Dame down four after this from Jaden Zachary you saw it coming just set the back screen and he pops he gets it and Spins get the angle on IMS who initially does does a great job defending him just a nice step through there just enough on that to get it in and big basket there to make it a two possession game Earl Grant has talked recently about trying to get everyone all his top guys going on the same night well he hasnt had that today either quit post has fouled out of this game first half post and Harris didnt even score but its guys like Zachary and Harris stepping up at different times in this second half it has and and at some point becomes habit and what do you do we got to you know hes probably got to figure out a way to protect post I dont know if it means sprinkle in some Zone you got to do something uh because youre not going to win a lot of games in this league if your best player is not on the floor and and involved hes such a big part like he and Burton have a ton of responsibility to their teams on both ends and its hard to find your Rhythm when youre passive because of foul trouble as well and BC is 23 seconds is away from taking a game home for him getting a a key Road win with post struggling for most of the game all right if youre Notre D down four Bren Shrewsberry is coming back into the game they put Marcus Burton back in quick and what way you got to go quick and get a basket you dont need a three you take a three if its open right now you need to extend the game you can stop the clock ideally drawing a foul but you need to get something going to the basket you know Boston College has been told not to foul here it definitely dont foul a threepoint shooter Imes to put it in three freshman for the Irish Shrewsberry a hand off to IMS around the screen no touch yet for Burton Shrewsberry Rises cant connect rebound Zachary and hes got a chance to put this thing on ice on the road for BC and thats why I say sometimes you try to get the two because if you miss that three these free throws will all been ended chance to make it a sixpoint game design wise would you have liked to see Burton be on ball I know you talked about him being off ball as he has been at times this year but he doesnt get a touch well in space he struggled with his decision making tonight as well and again hes learning and theres a lot of coaching still and discipline going on right now and you can see on the bench there hes telling IM his freshman guard he had two of his freshman guards on the floor there and theyre your primary ball handlers and decision makers and when youre dealing with fr you have to deal with the growth and the learning curve that comes with it and how about Earl Grant at Boston College on the road trying to sweep Notre Dame again theyve dominated this holy war over the last few years after it was all Notre Dame for the years preceding that to the corner and a Roper swirls one out battle on the boards and it does stay with Notre Dame down six with 58 to go Ro wins are hard to come by great job Errol Grant and the Eagles in their two game losing streak the last win was the last time they played Notre Dame at home and big for those guys as they get this win and then get to head home and take on the orange would be the first time ever Boston College has defeated Notre Dame four straight times Shrewsberry hits it gets it down to three with 18 Applause left got to try to get it five second count here Burton tipped it away and whos in last off of theyre going to go to the Monitor and have a look at this with2 at least for now showing remaining on the clock League Bale learn as well with that amount of time left you throw the ball to the length of the court you dont have if you dont see your teammates numbers throw it to the length of the Music Court Burton is the last to touch it I think yeah I think its a right call here one thing I wish we Chang though is that teams are getting an extra timeout lets just say in this situation I concern with the way with the amount of times we go to the monitor if theres someone at the scores table that can just speed this process up cuz hypothetically lets just say this ball was out on BC you get another chance of free time out however if theres ever a time to have a close look no no no you need to get it right Im saying theres somebody there like you you just made the call you made the call 30 seconds ago and now Ive seen it a few more times I want to know what you think cuz this is closer than I thought no that Balls off Burton I mean b if anything its off Harris and Burt at the same time its off Burton I love for know that a to have a chance to tie this up but I think its all Burton hand but I hear your point if we can just get a quick answer like one centralized Command Center someone at at the table that has it and just says well youre a tech guy you you figure it out well put you in charge of oh Id make it quick okay I do it it be but I cant do it what would be your success rate with video at 100 Im only saying someone that can help you with it to make your decision a lot quicker you want to get it right for sure but I think you give so many wow well how about this it was closer than we thought and theyre going to keep it with Notre Dame here at this end of the floor with point eight to Applause go so Notre Dam gets a last crack at this needs three to tie the mistake BCs guys are making right now you should not be inside har inside threepoint line everybody outside the threepoint line a two doesnt hurt hering Davis to put it in looking for somewhere to go Davis into CH for the tie no and Boston College wins on the road its the
