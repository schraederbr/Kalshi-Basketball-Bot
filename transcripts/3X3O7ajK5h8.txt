darkell Joyner and Jack Clark who in a combined o for 20 from the field on Friday night against Pittsburgh can they get back going again tonight for Kevin Keats yeah you see Keith talked about it earlier that not allowing their game to suffer shots dont go but a lot of times when youre a guy that come off a bad shooting game you want to be able to get some easy baskets interesting to see how those guys start out three throws it up officiating tonight with Bill Covington Jr and Ted Valentine underway from Reynolds Coliseum look at these jerseys Brian the same jerseys that the cardiac pack wore and the 8283 season turkey on Smith gets his own rebound Joyner for the reload for three and I guess that shows right now is that for Joyner again its always good to be able to get that first one to go down NC State is going to put a lot of pressure on top of the state when I talked to Juan Dixon he said that he would prefer to be able to get back in transition and make them Force up against the half board defense how about that Savvy veteran point guard decisionmaking by Smith there giving Joyner the open look instead of reloading himself coppin States answer from the corner wont go Isaiah grows too strong Smith and Joyner both are capable of around the point both are capable of filling it up as the shooting guard Applause Casey Moore sell nothing but net Marcel is that guy leading the ACC and for playing percentage field goal and then makes again if youre compensate you gotta understand The Scouting Report gotta force him to put the ball on the floor he has developed to one of the top shooters in the league the Virginia transfer on the drive sessums doesnt get the roll but he gets the whistle and the fouls going on Jack Clark a couple free throws here for the Penn State transfer Sam sessoms lets check out our keys to the game they are presented by your local Ford dealer Brian and Evan for Coppin State you got to take care of the rock because this Wolfpack team is really good leading the league and Steals and then for NC State Pace you want to be able to turn over your opponent be able to get out in transition and get an early offense foreign State team that wants to play fast as well they were seventh nationally in Pace a year ago not a great threepoint shooting team last year theyre better this year apart because Sam sessions has joined the Eagles he goes one for two and gets coffin on the board on Dixon the leader of Compton state still the alltime leading scorer at the University of Maryland and its still sad that Marylands top in the ACC but thats another conversation for another day NC States first turnover and sessoms all the way to the rack place it in and then we highlighted sessions and the way that Copper State is going to spread out North Carolina State hes going to be the guys going to try to touch the paint and get downhill we saw him a nice finish at The Rim for creveon Smith the leading scorer for the wolf pack averaging 16 a game Marcel rising up comes up short this time into Tark for the rebound coffin State four and six heres a deep three and a brick thrown up there by Daniel Titus the Australian forward Applause Music inside of the Serbian big man dushan mahorsich and hell create contact Applause you look at his penetration being able to get downhill and being able to absorb contact systems is one of those guys again for NC State youve got to be able to Corral him and help because hes going to break you down early Twitter Smith does and heres the thing with Smith is that hes going to be able to set you up because youve got to honor that threepoint shot because he can shoot it right inside half court has been able to do a better job this year of absorbing contact in that midrange game has been on fire its a big time scorer capable of making the tough shots maharchich deflects the pass Joyner herbal hardship getting a little fancy Up and Under but it finds Marcel to Smith three always those Second Chance opportunities NBC Smith ledner will pack Nation here again thats one of the guys again you got to stay glued to him because you do not want to see him get going early against the battle on the dribble and lays it off to Tark for the easy deuce and again Samsung systems being able to penetrate again Wolfpack got to do a better job of being able to come over that last time being able for the dump off for the easy basket Applause this end of the floor NC State four of seven three for five from deep and which way theyre going to go and a flopping call is the signal from Bill Covington Jr which is going to be a Class B Technical and one free throw Evan again we talk about turquavion Smith and again that last time being able to Corral the guy behind him and finish up with him you know again give him daylight it doesnt matter if your challenge look like he may have gotten hit right there nothing but the bottom of the net foreign State off to a nice run long conversation between two veteran officials Covington and Valentine whether that would be a flop warning or an offensive foul that looks like Joyner is going to step the line for one what do you think about this new rule this year Brian well again A lot of times when you see a bigger guy playing against a smaller guy it looked like he did kind of over exaggerate that well Orchard is one of those guys again definitely has the advantage by probably about 30 pounds Applause all going live but for a guy like Joyner you know if Im coming off of a game where I did not shoot it well you always want to be able to get those early baskets to be able to get your confidence flow 83 free throw shooter but this is that one still wolf pack ball DJ burns into the game for the first time hes averaging about eight points four rebounds a game off the bench Smith on the drive and it found the rebound action going against Coppin State okay watch how Shifty Chuck ravion Smith is and get hes got bounce you see going to the basket and then obviously being able to draw that foul I think one of the things too is that when you get the evaluation from the NBA Scouts this is the guy that you know he can score but you want to be able to see whats his playmaking ability is being able to not only create for himself but create for others Im going a little out of my Lane here is it inappropriate to say a little Dr J going up for the left hand its not I mean you Applause ages but when you see him being able to go up and maneuver that one hand you see the last two games 14 points eight for 24 Kevin Keys again wants to make sure his guys not only get going offensively but he doesnt want to see them if theyre not shooting well let it affect other parts of their game one of two Chris Smith whos got a quick six Justin steers to the basket and the foul on DJ Burns Applause foreign Music steers gives some offense to coppin stayed off the bench averages basically the same exact point total per game as DJ Burns about eight points veteran from Philly and the freethrow shooting for both teams has left something to be desired early on here LJ Thomas into the game The Freshman from Florida for NC State Music best game of the year for steers against Georgetown they took the Hoyas to overtime before falling short again against Patrick Ewings team so LJ Thomas will run the offense after steers goes one for two Music tough catch for Marcel in the corner shot clock at 10 Joyner going to work step back three and the rebound pulled down by Cameron blue good defensive possession by compensation again they want to be able to get a stop UC systems being able to penetrate hes a Nifty dribbler hes slippery he is man he puts a lot of pressure on them right now you look at both teams going at it so far NC State doing a good job early up by six Music State uniform hes got six points he also has two assists early in this game well I like the way how hes come out and hes Let The Game come to him again you know hes an electrifying score but you want to see his playmaking ability being able to get others involved much different team than they had last year hes got some more offensive weapons again Kevin Keith talks about him being able to allow The Bigs to be able to eat and then set up his other teammates sassums going back to work he was 15 for 22 from the floor on Saturday one for three at the outset tonight inside of the big man burns oh he had Thomas he missed him takes it himself and the rebound tipped and controlled by steers Sesame ahead and Cameron blue throws it down and again we talked about the fact that Coppin State wants to be able to get it off get the rebound and get out fast Ron Dixon talked about the pace is important for those guys Applause Burns in the lane for two burns with a nice soft touch and again big man is definitely giving them an opportunity somebody they can throw the ball into they can go get a bucket todays DJ Burns is 100th college basketball game including his three years at Winthrop Alex Rojas from the corner and the rebound go down by Thomas Joyner you never know when hes going to explode to the rim Clark had it poked away recovered sets up Joyner for a great look and he hits it jump shot by join our NBA Clark doing a good job of realizing he almost lost that ball and getting over the Joyner joined off to a good start in the first half two for two from Deep today very different story from Friday steers Knocked Down The Long two from the top of the key how about steers in the fact that hes come out looking for his offense realizing that youre not going to have Birds its going to come out that you see join me blow by to get to the basket for the basket theres that nuclear quickness he hit the turbo boosters quickly again Evan we talked about what coppin stating the fact that they want to be able to get up and down you see how quickly theyre able to pass the ball ahead you got guys that are running being able to finish blue with the electric electrifying dunk you see and then theyre turning around and you see State uh Joyner being able to go absorb that contact for the Finish hes off to a really good start at this first half surprised if we have a high scoring one tonight as you said earlier both these teams want to play fast and its essential for North Carolina State they want to be able to turn you over and then get out here you see Jordan come up short cop in state theyre going to try to force you into that half court defense and run every chance they get foul is on steers he picked up his second blue cant connect with the rebound last Touch by state NC State as opposed to the other topping stage the kids from Baltimore foreign Dixon in his sixth season at the helm of Coppin State he was a Special Assistant to Mark turgeon in Maryland for a year coach for womens School in DC Corner jumper wont go sessoms wins the foot race to the rebound then lost it but its bound by tarp poked away its a weird possession goodness gracious hopefully hes all right look out Applause in the Tark into the crowd again you see tar going into the stands so you want to sit Courtside way right and you know I think he owes that young lady a drink usually you have the drink before you jump in there laughing thats a different story Applause apologizing no one could hang on to the basketball that trip well and I think what you realize is that both teams are going to play a high octane type of offense and again right now defenses you see girls come up with a steal another turnover its a blocking foul and a bucket for Sam sessoms see Rose come down for quavion Smith I dont think he was set again you know wolf pack fans upset about that and I think that that was the correct calm youve got to have both feet set I thought he was still moving a little bit and my mistake obviously Isaiah gross with the bucket the fouls on Smith his first gross completes the threepoint play Now Kevin Keats felt that Friday against Pittsburgh was really the first time this season when his team just didnt play a good crisp basketball game and I thought it interesting because he said that this is a test of their chemistry because its always good when youre winning how would they react also coming off of a bad loss against Pitt having a couple of days right now it seemed like theyve come out and theyve been energetic sharing the ball and then being able to come up with opportunities as you see Smith wide open deep three turquadion Smith and again you talk about reading The Scouting Report thats the guy that when the shot goes up you want to stay close to you see more horses with a huge horse hustle play being able to get back and deflect that that ball Kevin Keats almost got a lap full of the big Serbian right here how about the big man showing that four combine 44 combine speed being able to get back except Kevin Keith didnt catch the big guy Im with you hes got his game face out hes focused especially after that blocked charge call didnt go his way Applause I like Juan Dixon Kevin Keats in year six at his current job heres sessoms always looking to attack slings it to the corner for blue long rebound Track by Smith another deep shot oh are you kidding me man good God what what range and again you can tell when he pulled it up you see Joyner come up to steal unable to pay it off long Rebound in mid Court Smith steals it away passes up the shot gives it to the corner Freon pass knocks down his first three of the Season how about turquivia Smith comes down Qs three then gets a steal instead of shooting it gets his teammate involved what a backtoback play nine nothing run for NC State turquionion Smith via the shot or the pass getting it done for the pack can they come out and they found ways to be able to get it early and when its been the three ball again everyones getting involved from Joyner to Smith to Marcel it seems like what theyve been able to do is they expand this league be able to get coffin on their heels and youve seen them already seven foot ten from behind the arc and again how about the long distance shot by Sir quavion Smith and when hes not doing it hes gonna pass it over to his boy pass to be able to get it going and right now you look at what theyve been able to do two for three for seven from two points a phenomenal seven for ten from behind the arc Coppin State has done a not so good job of being able to knock it down but the guy has been leading the way turquavion Smith with 12 points three for four three fours and three dimes let the triple double watch begin for turkuevion almost the exact opposite from a shot chart perspective for coffin Eagles are five of six from inside the arm but theyre over six from deep and they got to knock one of these down Rojas cant do it rebound tips to sessoms with your cop in state which you do great great pass by sessions you chip away at this thing again North Carolina state has shot that the eyes out of it you have to get some stops in the half court this is the team again when they can get some turnovers then get out in transition Applause Ernest Ross back to the corner for Joyner for three and heres the thing is that for coffee you got to do a better job and stay closer you got a guy enjoying it that you know has been knocking it down you knew that is he stays already hit 73s you gotta stay home before Force more horses to make a play Oh incredible blocks Ernest Ross says no Joyner to the corner Smith God goodness oh my god did the ball even stay in his hand more than two seconds great penetration by Joyner realizing takeover young Smith is being wide open again how about the threepoint shooting for nissy stayed in his first half weve got nine threes in 12 attempts barely played 10 minutes foul going on Ross here we highlighted NC State and this is how theyre leading the ACC in threepoint makes it again you see penetration where the first one is actually Joyner being able to get wide open get those feet set in the corner and after the penetration being able to get the ball you see two guys running over Ed Smith hes like you know what a half a second too late Im going up for it phenomenal stretch by NC State in his first half 152 we need to run and when you look at it you talk about the fact that they didnt shoot the ball well I figured you could say that theyve been able to write the skid 9 for 12 today from Lionheart I think when Kevin keeps talking he wasnt really that concerned he understanding hes got guys are going to get into the gym work on it and theyve come out and turn on not so much with the threepoint shooting but being able to play defense and then get back and not playing out of the net I think thats a great Point Brian and Kevin Keats who is not particularly concerned and of course all coaches friend about how their team will bounce back from a disappointing performance and he gave Pittsburgh credit but he also said we got a lot of good looks and we just didnt hit theyre showing that they those chops down tonight Smith again Applause stop it stop it turn the AC up baby lets take coffee on Smith is on fire again lots of penetration again you see the shooter goes over to him foul the and one in the bucket look at him hes like yeah baby turn my mic up I am on fire five of six from Deep six of seven overall hes only playing seven minutes Brian hes got 18 points make it 19 but the thing thats really impressive is that how NC State is sharing the basketball its not just her graveyard Smith its all of the other guys theyre turning defense to be able to get out an early transition theyre spreading copper out and again knocking down shots too Applause going back to the wolf pack what a display of shooting as you can tell by that stride yeah you look the smile hes like yeah Im feeling it Im feeling it Im in my bag tonight if you were concerned as an old pack fan oh theyre not a PNC maybe they wont shoot as well in Reynolds I mean heres the thing theyre up 3815 their last six field goals have all been three pointers 10 of 13 now incredible inside for hardship Thrift by tarp and Tark no Smith with his fourth rebound gonna be keeping track of that number Smith leaves it for Clark gets his own rebound and then lost it on the attack do you see more horses shes like hey man I know were shooting threes cause Im running give your boy a touch yeah Clark somehow keeps possession going against Marcel good hands Clark with a steal mahorsich gets the touch he was looking for and pays it out and heres the thing you keep seeing uh my horses run and run and that last time you pay your Bigs off because youre knocking down threes but how about you see Smith a little over aggressive trying to come up with that steal and one of the things we talked about NC state was the pace thats his second foul too on Smith well and you see well talk about the pace a lot of times the big guy you want to reward him because big guys want to eat too when you see more archers being able to run and come up in the pace by NC State is not only created by knocking down the threes its the Congressional defense getting deflect deflections and getting into the early offense scored 107 against FIU theyre on Pace for like 135 140 right now Sam sessions not having a bad half himself hes got five the systems is showing that he is a really good player because of his building to be able to break down the defense and get to a spot youve seen a couple of times being able to get the blowbys for the early but hes gotta theyve got to get some stops because again North Carolina state has been really efficient offensively finds Marcel now Clark six to shoot Marcel step back rebound pulled down by Blue Applause Mike Hood knocks down the first three of the nine for Coppin State and Kevin Keats immediately calls a timeout did not like the transition defense well and heres the thing you dont want to get too too content with the three ball and not get back in defense and again for coppin you chip away at this thing this is the team again if you play a good solid defense get yourself an opportunity to get back in Timeout on the floor taken by NC State Kevin Keith cant be too disappointed his team has made 10 threes already heres one of the five for turquoise in 2002 the most outstanding player of the final four state to get back in this game theyre gonna need some guys with a Juan Dixon S type of effort right now again down 20 you see that theyve gone to a Zone gotta get some stops and theyll be again chip away at this thing in the last 7 40 Juan Dixon born and raised about five minutes from Kaufman State retired by athletic director Derek Carter who said he was captivated by Juans passion and tenacity his top 15 certainly In Contention in the meac Lost in the final last year one of the reasons Sam sessoms came to Coppin State is he believed he could help get this team over the hump and to the NCAA tournament on Casey Marcel sending Justin steers to the line Applause assassins two years at Binghamton two years at Penn State now here at coppin now a quick message from works for any project with Gaslight hour without the gas fueled by Power share batteries to give you the power to outperform ance Smith on the bench after picking up that second foul and unable to keep it alive Joyner tumbles across the end line and gets helped up by a teammate and Mr Wolf have you seen two turnovers two backtoback turnovers again still plenty of time for a cop in state again you see North Carolina State turn the ball over extending their pressure Mr Wolf almost left you hanging earlier tonight when you were giving him a fist pump theres a little simmering Yellow Jacket wolf pack I was gonna say I was simply I was kind of feeling a little bit of the tension there disrespect Applause Ryan Oliver playing for the rambling wreck had some memories in this building Jack Clark for three Clark still hasnt found his range but he comes up with a steal Clark to Joyner Applause coffin State ball Applause what do you remember about the atmosphere in this Building compared to some of the other atmospheres that you played in the late 80s early 90s so again not to take myself but going back into the you know late 80s in early and that 90 season I remember coming here and playing against the likes of you know Chris corciani and then uh Rodney Monroe and I remember their fans being very very into it you know this being a really loud place again not one of my most favorite places to play because again they always had you know a great fan base and again those Jim Valvano teams will always seems that are well coached they play really high octane offense to play defense but then again if youre a college basketball fan and during those times I enjoyed the competition and Coach KREM is didnt sub you out of games very much right you played a lot of minutes yeah especially in 1992 between me and Dennis Scott and Kenny Anderson shout out Bobby grimmins one of my guys Lethal Weapon three but it was definitely a a time where we played a lot of minutes like I said that hot octane uh offense that we had it was definitely a good run well speaking of a good run its an eightnothing run for Coppin State Burns cant hit it the Eagles trying to scrap their way back into this one assassins tied up by pretty good defense from Brian pass through defense bypass Music were NC State fans particularly rude or aggressive or something compared to some of the other races are you really going to ask me that question knowing that Ive got NC State fans like like a like two feet behind me the NC State fans were amazing they were polite they were courteous I mean now youre just making stuff up Music 551 the timeout called by Compton State theres Kozel McQueen member of the 83 national champs fourth round pick in the 85 draft pulls theyll look at that shot man you know what I love I love the fit I mean tail that looks like he still might be able to go out and give you about maybe 10 points at about 12 rebounds he said dont put that on me BL he said dont do that man come on come on Music that was incredible timing Music darkell Joyner one point in 38 minutes on Friday got 11 points in 14 minutes so far tonight to craving on Smith on the bench for the 2000 hes got 19 in just nine minutes on the court I wonder if well look back in that second pound might cost him a tripledouble and what we looked at earlier it looked like it was going to be a route by North Carolina State coppin has been able to chip away at this thing and again you still got plenty of time in this first half old pack has been stuck on 40 for a while and heres the thing which youve seen the adjustment Compton state has done a better job getting back in transition defense and even though NC State is getting the stop being able to get back you see nice pass by Burns and a little pirouette and finish from Casey Marcel and this is one of the things you dont hear a lot about about Burns hes a guy that you can throw the ball in it not only gives you an opportunity to throw it in for a bucket his first option is to look for that backside cutter bad pass stolen by Marcel showtime for Joyner and this is where this North Carolina State team thrives again we talk about that threepoint shot making ability this is also a team that leads the conference and Steals and theyre very active Kevin keese talks about being able to have guys with active hands and being able to create offense from good defense is just all right then 10 points off seven cop and turnovers step back three for Hood wont go and Marcel grabs another rebound some first half minutes tonight inside Burns and it smacked Away by sessoms Marcel the leader systems the other way and a bumping foul going against Joyner Applause having a chat with Bill Covington Jr right at the scorers table that puts uh confident in the bonus so one and one here for the Eagles six foot eleven Slovenian sophomore Luca to kausich is in the game for the first time for Coppin State and sessoms will shoot the one and one Applause four for ten from the freethrow line in this first half for the Eagles and heres the thing is that you have to take advantage of the opportunities of being able to knock down shots you see great ball movement Jack Bart still not finding the range Joyner off the steal Joyner fouled by Sesame Applause friendly banter between those two fellows and well get ourselves a timeout NC State creating offense from their defense dark Hill Joyner having a heck of a half to cuevion Smith and joy in a two that never has to pay for a ticket around here Derek whittenberg the championship winning assist we can call it that right absolutely DeWitt in the house talk about a wolf pack uh greatness right there man thats royalty right there my man D winning in the building all pack Legends who are here tonight Im sure if I asked him he was like Bill I can still give you about 25 or 30 because Dewey was one of those guys they could knock it down man Im sure you probably still got a nice stroke yeah officially honor the 83 team in February when Wake Forest comes to PNC thats the game that uh the most members of the 83 team could make but uh several are still in the local greater Raleigh Durham triangle area so they are no strangers to Wolf Pack Hoops even 40 years later whats going on for the free throw line Brian I was going to say as well as NC state has shot the ball from the Honda Arc right now only two for six Hopkins fourth to ten NC States down three for seven comfortable 22point lead systems turned away Ernest Ross with his second rejection of the night and that was already already ready to annoy some sessions as that you see good God what a block Ross comes over and said no your request has been denied foreign injured Eagle in the corner Isaiah gross not sure if he slipped on a wet spot or what happened to the athletic training staff is going to come check on Gross in Eleanor Roosevelt High School in Maryland you see the play over there and oh and it seemed like ankle just kind of turned on him yeah you know sometimes that when youre on that floor you may uh step awkwardly at least hes able to walk home thats good by himself guys had an injury played career hes in his fourth year at coppin red shirt in his first season with an injury Applause Music NC State all things consider has done a pretty good job on sessions at the center of the floor Applause you notice that every time a shot goes up Coppin State is not really sending that many guys to the point you see the blow by by Joyner Marcel a couple steps closer in and out park with another rebound sessoms kicks it Hood short gets it back pretty good straight up defense for crossing the hardship drips it down George was one of those guys whos playing really hard I love the fact that understands that his role on his team is to to rebalance that pigs and hes going to get a touch every now and then because defense is going to force I only have to guard these threepoint shooters Applause maybe a heat check moment there impressive that was pass ahead to Blue Music its been a while since the Eagles have scored Brian yeah yeah I attribute that to a good half court defense NC State doing a good job of being another Corral hes a good pass Applause and they had it on the doorstep but Ross comes up to loose ball and Smith fouled by Blue and again when you try to get up and Corral Smith because again you know from that distance he can pull it up in that last time again he is super crafty with the ball you know we highlight the fact that hes a knock down shooter you see him come out and get a little bit of a rest first half of taekwamy on spit Smith hes got 19 coppin is 23 Smith and Joyner combined have outscored cop 3323 another one LJ Thomas traveled no bucket Applause seventh NC State turnover hes like really come on man its not quite a bayheim face but hes getting closer he was like that wasnt a travel man it was a little bit of a Euro Step Applause Music reaching foul going on LJ Thomas Allison sessoms to the line I believe for a oneonone I think a little bit of a recap in the first half when you look at NC State and how weve gotten is 45 points solid defense being able to get Steals and again this is where you look at statistically this team has excelled so far in the years that they get steals they shoot the lights out of it theyre leading the three the league and threepoint percentage numbers made and then Steals and thats really what weve seen on display tonight here are the numbers for sessoms among NCAA leaders hes right near the top and uh Ken Palms Advanced statistics he does this thing called game MVPs only the seven foot four big man for Purdue Zach eating has more game MVPs than San sesums in college basketball this season well we talked with Kevin Keith early and you see Marcel going down on the floor he even that they had to put a lot of attention to our systems as you see Ross gonna battle up look what he found him up hes like looks he here 47 and a half I think any coach will take that they had 40 with about nine minutes to go in the half so theyve certainly cooled off foul gonna send Tark back to the line second foul on Marcel Music no more cell and Smith two wolf pack starters with two thousand piece sending Tark to the line joining his big brother Anthony at Kaufman State couple years ago yeah Rookie of the Year in his first season encourage you to stay tuned for the fast break presented by your local Ford dealer that is coming up at some point in the second half foreign Applause State and then the ball movement I mean the Shady music great pass back door by Ross and again the horse is another one of those guys again along with Burns one of the better big passing bigs in the ACC 15 assists on 18 field goals for NC State Music on the drive nice move by systems being able to get under a horses how about 15 assists and a half for the pack as well as the fact that they have been sharing the ball and the ball doesnt stick East West penetrate touch the paint kick out long two Joyner nope rebound comes right to pass and he takes it into the teeth of the cop in defense and loses possession shot clock off 10 seconds in the half Essence with a ball and a string takes it makes it nice bucket thats 12 for sessoms and look NC State missed its final six threes and a half and coppin is closer than they were they trailed by as many as 25 its a 17point game with a break but this guy is just a special player yeah look at his numbers 19 points five threes and again for Coppin State going into the half NC State back in the building that they played in from 1949 to 1999 theyve played on average one game a year since then theyre 232 inside Reynolds since 99 2000 season when they moved over to PNC gravion Smith making a memory tonight 19 first half points for the wolf pack who are looking to get to eight and two tonight ahead of a trip to Miami Smith hard Landing there Justin steers and does push himself up which is a good sign bill Covington Blows the Whistle because he saw the landing and heard it same way we did I mean that was a hard fall a fall and you can hear just again that was that was a tough one Evan always thought that in first five minutes for each team is always essential for for Coppin State they were able to score some baskets to kind of cut this lead down to 17 you want to be able to come out and try to strike theyve done a good time good job at times of being able to penetrate systems has been able to get to the basket for NC State you do not want to fall in love with that three you want to go back to creating your offense with great defense assassins working on Joyner tough shot Joyner comes up with a rebound Joyner takes takes it and heres the thing he put so much pressure on the defense when youve got a guy like that thats coming at you full steam thats that athletic ability to touch the paint youve got a big thats backtracking great control of being able to pull up on a knock down that three 17 now for Joyner but a quick answer for coppin and Tark he could be a big time scorer good penetration by TARC being able to realize that he had Clark being able to get to his strong arm great physical body being able to absorb the contact again this coppin team has not gone away theyre still trying to stay in there Ron Dixon said that his team he believes that theyre a tough team and that theyre going to continue to push for the entire 40 minutes foreign Applause Music state to get Jack Clark going a little bit hes averaging 10 points a game but hes over 11 from the field his last three halves of basketball and theyre going to need him because again you want to make sure that you got a guy like that that not only is going to be able to give you what you need on the defensive end you want him to be able to establish some type of Rhythm because when you get into ACC play youre going to have teams that are going to focus on Smith and Joyner you need a guy like that to be able to give you something on the offensive end of the floor too Smith badgering Tark for the full 93 feet Justin steers has some length to him at 67 back for blue hell try one round it out rebound more sell you notice they were the guards get that ball Biggs are out running and how about control there by Joyner again he is a strong guy you can see it in his in his bounce hes like Im back you cant guard me you cant stop me all you can do is just to Hope the season high was 26 against FIU the ACC player of the week after his performance down in the Bahamas oh Sam follow for blue wouldnt stay Tark on a third chance inside for the Slovenian Luca to couches Applause Joyner and Smith each have 19 and Clark still cant connect Brian was there for a stretch in your career where you didnt make a shot for like three consecutive halves and howd you deal with it mentally Im gonna sound really arrogant no try and get I mean I had to stay with you where youre going to I mean there have been times where you know I have not been making me I wasnt really shooting great but the thing is is that you always want to try to get an easy bucket you dont want to let every shot be a complicated three you know try to get some layups try to go get some easy baskets get fouled get to the free throw line then you can see the ball go into the basket then it makes it a lot easier for you excellent defense from a horse Applause Joiner oh man Applause is it safe to say that hes back is it safe to say that you know that the last game was just a little bit of an anonymous I mean watch the fact the penetration being able to absorb the contact and be able to keep his eyes on the rim again in taquamian Smith and his ability by how about Joyner and how hes been able to burst on the scene and be that that second score of NC State hes got all eight for NC State in the opening three minutes here in the second half 22 overall open man is blue for three good penetration by systems and being able to create that opportunity timeout taken by Juan Dixon to talk after the triple from Cameron blue they got one in just over three minutes gone here in the second half and its time now for the fresh market discover the best those two guys has foreign copy by themselves I mean talking about the best look at these numbers combined 41 points nine for 14 from behind the arc nine boards and four dimes again you talk about the fact if Ill scored copping by themselves this is an amazing run and again you know this cop and State team is a very good team but you can see that North Carolina state is really just kind of Motoring and cooking all all cylinders right now foreign has been quiet so far in the second half oh for two man not anymore nice Blow Bar and again take Columbia Smith again able to be able to set up the drive and you see sessoms come back on the other end but again when we talk about him Im gonna look at the level of explosiveness and then talk about looking he is crazy athletic for his size being able to blow by and finish at The Rim third foul on Casey Morrison you can just see Smith Envision him at the next level being a microwave guy coming off the bench scoring points quickly well and heres the thing you know that he can shoot the ball and you know that hes got you know hes really quick and hes really crafty with the ball hes one of those guys team when you look at how that translates to the next level hes going to be a handful for other NBA hey the thing is is that can he play making get all those involved and I think that what you were seeing earlier on in his nonconference season you definitely have to answer that with a huge yes averaging over five assists per game hes added that to his game NC State more of its last five Smith comes up empty there thought he was fouled Sessa lost a handle in between his legs he corralled it Applause and hes not allowed to do that NC State ball check that check out this you dont see this very often again you see him be able to come through and trap it with my knees Von Dixon who shared a Embrace with Ted Valentine before the game those two guys go back a long way now arguing about what just transpired thats where Ive ever seen that call before Brian yeah it is the first for everything and again nice time Paul workich better blocked Justin steers knocks it away sessoms almost threw it to the second row but kept the line by Malik battle and see this is one of the things that Clark does well he hasnt really had a good offensive night but hes a good defender on the perimeter being able to hold his on you see good dive wow right down Broadway Justin steers slams it in even assess him to show not only is a guy that can break down the defensive score will his play making a building his vision his court vision is amazing Ill tell you what game is not over not at all because again youve seen that with NC States ability to be able to score you see yet another turnover gives comp an opportunity this is a 16 point game 10th turnover for NC State coffin with a little momentum not what Kevin Keats is looking for defensively Justin steers rocks the rib protecting the pig brought to you by CPI Security attacked the rim at your own risk and again weve talked about NC State and their ability to be at a great good good offense from that defense and youve seen right there being able to come up and say Ross saying you know what your request has been denied there will be no soup no candy put the kids to bed protecting the Pain by CPI Security he didnt really speak but all those things were going through his mind where you just said absolutely he was emphatic with that coach asleep go to sleep go night night but going to break then we talked about this cop and State team they have not gone away at as much as you think the NC State has dominated this ball game Coppin State again down 16 opportunity you see by Simpsons and again what he has done again is he is countlessly put the pressure on the NC State guards by being able to get downhill go for his offense get everybody and keep them in this game no earners for us to the game there to protect the pain Joyner in the lane defended well almost throws it away this will be a key stop for the Chicago State Eagles but cartel Joyner has the answer that is strong because again when you watch him be able to explode to the basket to knock down the threes again the Lost star of the midrange being able to get to a point and get that separation assassins again in the lane behind steers access wants it back and he played the Big Ten for Penn State Kick Out Pass battle missed it another offensive rebound blue throws it up more so pulls it down wolf pack dodged a couple of bullets there they did Music Smith finds the spot puts it in and see if business was going to make this North Carolina State team so good when youve got a guy like taekwondo Smith that you can just give him the ball and he can get you a bucket this is one of those things when teams go on runs you can give him the Rock and thatll be able to get him a bucket and then he pulled a run another Miss from the corner but on the offensive glass ninja Turk lays it in Second Chance bucket for Coppin State and Clark just Target just hanging around there again as quickly as we talk about NC State come up with a basket then you see Coppin State still hanging around not going away DJ Burns is going to come back in next whistle for the wolf pack Applause lets go for Clark sessoms tried to go behind his back recovered and then Marcel gets a piece of it good defense by Marcel Applause Joyner for Smith Music a fortune goes down hard keeps it alive moorchetts is down as Smith scores you see more horses down on the ground right there look like he hit his knee with the injuries to NC State big men Through The Years this is not something you want to see and goodness gracious foreign uncomfortable after this awkward Landing the looks from his teammates on the bench nearby illustrates the level of concern yeah it is it is tough its tough when you see one of your teammates go down like this New Order you just never know as a player as a fan when something like this could happen and look maybe hell be okay and be back on the field in a couple minutes obviously thats what were hoping for but uh initially a scary scene Amplified just by the reactions of his teammates and mahorsich in a short time has ingratiated himself on this roster were talking about the chemistry earlier Brian this is a closely knit team and uh theyre gonna take the media time out for under 12 right here as they continue to look at mahorich whos in considerable pain holding Kevin Keats his hands Applause for the grad student from Belgrade Serbia dushan mahorsich he did put some weight on both legs but clearly somethings wrong well and heres the thing the thing is devastating for this team is the fact that this is the guy that plays hard and when you got a guy that plays that hard you see him go down its definitely got to be an emotional thing for for his teammates Music he won remaining here in the second half and NC state has an 18 point lead although it does not feel like hes put on Dixons Bunch away TJ Burns back in the game and jaquavion Smith is going on the line Brian Smith and Joyner have scored all 16 of NC States points here in the second half well and again theyve needed that because slowly Coppin State has been able to chip away at this league Applause were going to be going here momentarily by the legendary Derek Wittenberg as coffin State Kansas three good shot for Christians suck from the corner back to a 16point game for joint by wolf pack royalty Derek Wittenberg guy that probably has gotten a few free meals in this town Im looking for my nil dude theres still time whats it like coming back into this building watching the wolf pack play and seeing all these fans again well we have the greatest fans in the country I believe and uh its hard to believe its 40 years and these fans still appreciate it so much and I love these fans I love our supporters our teammates uh what a special moment and a special time in my career here you talk about the fact its been 40 years but it doesnt seem like its past that long can you just remember just that run that you guys had that year how well how magical was it going when in the ACC tournament and then going on for that magical run to eventually win the national championship well it started right here guys when we we scored 130 points against Wake Forest before we went to the ACC Championship and and in the tournament and we won the senior our senior game right here in a blowout fashion so that this Reynolds Coliseum was was the momentum for us going into that ACC tournament in NCAA an incredible run as the double dribble called on DJ Burns you guys were 16 and 10 and then won your final team look at the monitor here Applause I didnt play in that game because I was hurt right I was a Carolina game and Ernie Myers came in took my place did a terrific job I came back uh later at the end of the season against UVA and uh we lost to Maryland here at home and then we won that Wake Forest game my last game right here in Reynolds when you look back at that team and the fact that you guys I mean you were explosive and you know you were labeled the card he had kids talk about some of those games and some of the competition and just how well balanced your team was we played the number one team in the country how about that for Jack Clark talking about being able to get back in the game how about that one to get you going what a what a play by Clark we played the number one team in the country that Year guys seven times and the ACC was the number one conference in the country at the time and had the great Michael Jordan uh on Carolinas team and Ralph Sanson threetime player of the year what a great League a lot of great competition and preparedness Financial say reminiscence of Dewitts old school athleticism old school avalonism 1978 won the Slam Dunk Contest in Baltimore Civic Center against Gene Banks and Albert King Im gonna date myself is that during like the capital classic days yeah Capital classic I know what like I said you and I were standing in the same line around there and I remember following behind you man that just watching you guys in that bad Court between with you and Sydney Lowe then averaging having some guys like Jose McQueen thorough Bailey I mean you guys had a lot of talent then you talked about some of the competition and some of the Great Schools you played against kind of help us relive just not only that run but how the competition was for you guys in ACC well everybody stay in school Ralph Sampson stayed for four years uh Jordan stayed for three uh we uh we had great talent but everybody knew each other and you had senior Laden teams that played together that wanted to win was that remember Carolina won the National Championship in 82 and we came back in 183 so great competition but veteran teams that played together and stayed together incredible times in the ACC we see the footage of that great pass to Lorenzo you had as time is winding down people dont talk as much about the double overtime game against Pepperdine that you guys had in round one to get five oh man that double overtime game Sydney low fouls out of the game I played with with Sydney for seven years three in high school and foreign Collins I didnt know how to play without him Sydney wasnt in the game and luckily uh Jordans for playing and Ernie Myers came in and did a great job and We snuck that game out no shot clock no threepointer guys we came back and tied that game up with with with the best free throw shooter in the in the maybe in the country Dwayne shuttle from Pepperdine he missed two oneonones and thats how we came back and won that game meanwhile we got an 11 point game here as sessoms hits the three cat with Derek Wittenberg reminiscing about old times what is it like when you come together with all your old teammates at a game like this well we did something that was special that we never forget uh you know our coach is not here but his spirit is here about the spirit is always going to be with us were celebrating 40 years but thats a special group of guys we stay close together we keep in communication and its nothing when you do something as special as winning the National Championship its memories for everybody you talk about still staying in contact is it true that Terry again is still upset with you for not passing in the ball and that last shot of the championship game you ought to know better Im not a pastor Im a shooter no you should know something about that I know that man for those that dont know D with like I say youre here for the buckets not for the assist absolutely You Got To Know Your Role right absolutely kyp know your personnel big block by Burns loose ball picked up by Clark teamwork let me ask you this as you look at this team right now whats your assessment of this Wolfpack team now as youve seen them in this early nonconference start very K football I like to guard play with Joyner and Smith big guys are coming along I think that as we learn each other because remember theres still a brand new team and we try we still trying to jail together find an identity but as we grow we got a chance to really have a really good season with these guys keep playing together and working hard together and playing hard an awful lot of attention for taquavion Smith how about darkwell Joyner as you see a nice pass by Burns um whats your thought on Joyner in his game Joanna you have to have a good a point guard you have to have a good quarterback in football and thats what Jordan is hes an excellent quarterback who knows how to run a team Hes Got Confidence he shares the basketball I love joining this place so far hes getting better and better hes going to be a key for us having a really good season its been a wild last couple of minutes in Compton very much within Striking Distance here and sessoms oh he missed the layup he gets it back and he puts it in to make it a 10point game with seven minutes to play I mean as weve been sitting here talk I mean Ive been state has still been crackling and its really Scrappy here did you see a little quick take foul well their coach Juan Dixon was a heck of a player himself National Champion played in the NBA his team is not going to quit they got excellent guards they got a whole lot of guards we got to continue to keep those guards and be able to see you man thank you for coming to see us thank you guys thank you so much appreciate it thank you just hanging out with wolf pack royalty here Courtside we got a game 6 51 to play Music 7464 NC State leads great fun hanging out Courtside with Derek Wittenberg he just showed me a text on his phone David Thompson was watching said great interview oh wow talk about The Human Highlight room yes indeed one of the greatest to ever lace up the sneakers meanwhile sips is keeping his meac team in the game here and we talked about it Evans the fact that we thought the NC State was going to run away with it you see the last three games 28 points 62 field goal percentage and five dimes four rebounds he tonight has singlehandedly been able to bring Coppin State back into this game as theyve cut this this week this lead down to 10 yeah eight assists just two turnovers for sessoms along with the 24 points possession here Marcel takes it missed it battles for the board Jack Clark for the hustle play and foul is going on coppin so when you look at Clark going after that rebound this is one of the things that Kevin Keith talked about he does not want his guys if theyre not shooting well to let it affect other parts of the game youve seen him continuously play hard continues to go and hit the boys thats one of the things that he wants his guys to be able to do battle his second Smith pull up short tip wouldnt go another try from Burns comes up empty but hes fouled both pack Ive had like six chances this trip down the floor to get points well you see DJ Burns being able to muscle his way around there to keep that that possession alive not shooting foul Tark picks up his second wolf pack inbound under the buckets Smith for burns Applause another foul on cop and this time its blue but how do you guard Smith because again if you back off of me he shoots it from from downtown Raleigh but then if you get up on him hes allowed to be able to swing through again Von Dixon has done a good job of being able to sub his guys in and out and be able to maintain pressure and he talked to me earlier about to say hey Ryan if this thing gets down in the gut of the game Im confident in our half court defense right now again with Smith going to the line for two excuse me one and one yeah rare free throw Miss there for t hes led the wolf pack and assist each of the last eight games hes Leading The Way with five assists so far tonight as much as weve celebrated NC State and their ability to be able to score and get transition points they have not been able to find an answer to being able to contain Sam Simpson and again sessoms has been able to get to the basket and break them down at will might be headed toward another Ken Palm game MVP for the points in the assistant Smith and jarkel Joyner can make their own case to be the top star tonight Burns has size on everybody sets up Smith passes up to three sets up Joyner who knocks it down the play was set up by by Burns again he threw the ball and the first thing he did he looked to the weak side came the ball over to Smith Smith penetrated moved the defense and allowed Jordan to be able to come with that knock down three six assists with your gravey on 27 points for jarkel one of the dynamic backcourts in the ACC combining for 55 points tonight clock winding down and the bailout foul goes against Burns again talking about The Possession watch Burns barely realize go to the opposite side Smith realized hey if I go in and bring two guys kick it out hell join a wide open three and again you say hey come on let me hear it let me hear you all Let me hear the love I mean this is dark Cal joyners first ever game in this building which is still the home of West Moores NC State womens basketball team the threetime reigning ACC Champs who knocked off the Georgia Bulldogs last night after the start for the wolf pack women theyre back in the top 10 again still plenty of time a little bit more than five minutes and again youll see NC State make good plays but again look at the fact that first half threepoint shooting 10 for 19 second half two for eight Coppin State done a much better job of being able to force NC State in a contested shots Music tend to shoot five minutes in the game Joyner short oh Clark rips it away more cell from the Baseline and Evan those are the 50 50 balls again that dont show up in the stat sheet we talked about Clark not having the best offensive night but being able to give your team another possession especially when youre going back thats got to be huge for them how about Jack Clark hes one for his last 15 from the floor but hes impacting the game in so many other ways Coppin State continues to be that annoying gnat of an opponent that just wont go away again Watch nobody puts a body on Clark he comes in there hustle plays and then being able to get the ball over to Marcel nice little soft jumper being able to get again those are the things that Kevin Keith talked about he wants to see his guys still be able to stay and contribute if youre not scoring DJ Burns just called for his fourth personal foul Justin steers knocks in the free throw makes it a 10point game Burns is out Ross back in timeout Compton with 436 to play certainly the wolf pack losing one of their key rotation big men and dushan mahorsich with Burns picking up number four you think about that upcoming schedule for the wolf pack Saturday at Miami Furman Vandy still winless Louisville here in December which is stunning when you look at the next five games and then you know wondering if theyre able to pull this out I mean this is a favorable schedule that Miami team Jim lareneggers team is one of those teams that can finish up in the upper echelon and then when you look at this Foreman team again Vanderbilt and then talk about Louisville you know my old Philadelphia 76 your teammate Kenny Payne yeah I feel like its just a matter of time before they get their first win but for North Carolina state that next five games is something that they can get through this one and get I mean go down and play well against Miami they maybe end up being a team that could be ranked in the top 25 visions of returning to the big dance for the first time since coach keatss first year as the head coach of NC State still work to do tonight though against Coppin State again we were celebrating NC State in the first half and you know they were going off with the threes again coppin has still been able to fight back and you know and theyve been able to go blow blow by blow again a little less than five minutes if your NC State you got to be able to make sure that you still stay what youre doing touch the paint and then you got to get some stops coppin has done a good job of being able to touch the pain and get the ball and break down the guards and get to the basket Music foreign Applause early LED 4015 in the first half theyre quavion Smith man what a bull box hes got 30 and heres what Copper State has to do a better job of when he comes up that pick and roll steers has got to step up when you allow Smith to be able to go and get downhill on you hes showing that hes athletic and he can finish at The Rim got to do a better job on that pick and roll I would trap it a nice pass and a foul called on Ross after the Bobble from Tark Kevin Keith doesnt like to call you see Smith being able to turn the corner to be able to extend that lead to push the wolf pack up 12 it has led by as many as 25 its a 12 point game right now where you look at the combination between Smith and Joyner combined 57 already 10 threes but when its allowed Compass state to get back in this game is that Simpsons has been able to break down the defense 24 points and nine dimes interesting to see how this thing finishes out it also steers has been a guy for compensate has to come up big in the second half two free throws for Ninja shark rookie of the year now in his third year for Coppin State and goodness gracious free throws have been better for the Eagles in the second half but they still have missed eight of them in the game and Reynolds Coliseum crescendos Applause no free chicken tonight big possession for North Carolina State love that high pick and roll action being able to touch the paint crowd never gets louder when theres free chicken on the line to the bucket Joyner hes got 29 and what youve seen is you when youve got two guys and joining Smith that you can put them in a high pick and roll spare screen allow them to be able to get downhill thats one of the things thats a goto especially in the gut of the game when you need a bucket thank you Applause systems gets it right back and an offensive foul called on the screen before the shot and steers just fouled out again and we were talking about when you need to be able to go to the to a person get a basket you see again Joyner being able to navigate and finish right at The Rim you better extend that lead in on the other end you see steers right there and a lot of times Turner right there into the man and you know what thats going to be a foul because you got to be able to hold that screen points six rebounds 22 minutes for Justin steers so his night is done with 321 to play if your cop in state you is emphatic that you have to get a stop right now and if Im North Carolina State I I stick to the scripts youve had two plays where you run that high pick and roll and being able to have your guards turn the corner you stick to whats working state is out of timeouts Applause Smith for Ross for two but heres the thing Smith that last time recognized that they opted the double team no rotation you had a wide open Ross Hood Vision by take corvian Smith being able to get the ball over for easy late seven assists tonight for Smith to go along with 30 points five rebounds and theres the steal again solid defense by Clark you know we talked about the fact that has not had the best offensive night but I like the fact that still stayed engaged coming up a rebounds and good defensive plays foreign Smith sessions called for the foul to Jack Clark to the line whos had a better night than his one for seven shooting suggests hes got nine rebounds five assists and some huge hustle plays for the pack where if youre Kevin keising youre showing your team this game film you highlight these things from Clark letting them know that hey you didnt have a great shooting night but you still stayed engaged on different parts you talk about the 50 50 balls being able to come with those offensive rebounds being able to come up with the Steals and the defense those are things that are definitely integral as far as being able to win ball games one for two for Clark do the Eagles have one last gasp Ark now with 10 rebounds in the game and if youre NC State right now you run your play talk is your friend youre up by 16 you exhaust a little bit of shot clock and you go that high pick and roll because again it has shown or Applause you know what just say run a little clock and then just go for yours 33 for turquavion Smith and NC State gives away the rebound its a third career 30point game for Smith he had 30 against Florida State 34 against North Carolina both those games last year hes got 33 tonight including all three of these I mean look at the dagger from almost half court you can tell he was like yeah buddy if you see come out what a knife or take one Beyond three quarters Miss excuse me but he has been been amazing 33 points seven dimes five rebounds and then six threes already a season High somehow I think that hes probably gonna Eclipse that before his season ends this likely he crosses over a thousand points in his career by the end of the season thats tough to do in two years hes on track to do it step back jumper good for Cameron blue seven points for blue with a 17point deficit for coffin common State team stays in the state they go to Greenville to play the East Carolina Pirates this weekend Applause Malik battles and disbelief over that foul call a league battle by the way didnt play a Georgia Tech crime but he played at South Georgia Tech I didnt see that I didnt see that close but no cigar Bridge attack by the way in a battle tonight with the Georgia Bulldogs final minute of the game Tech leading by one 7877 Casey Marcel not a huge night but a solid night seven points five rebounds couple assists 34 minutes it has been Smith and Joyner doing the fall for the scoring these two guys have been buying for 62 and I thought it interesting we talked with Kevin Keats early in pregame he was interested to see how his team was going to respond to that last loss at home against Pitt and I think that he saw a lot of good things obviously its always good to get the win but how came out and they were able to with their offense and their defense and then in the second half when this good cop and State team was still there they were able to respond get some stops and be able to close out this game hands from Ross hes racked up the Steals and blocks as Clark dishes it over to pass LJ Thomas looking for his shot he scores Thomas is another one of those guys again good finisher at the at the rim timeout called by Kevin Keith just to get some subs into the game and here come the walkon and here are the fan favors you know if you want to give this car Ill get loud these are the guys and again that get a chance to get a little burn now youre going to hear every time one of those guys touch shoot shoot Chase Graham KJ Keats Alex Nunnally and Jordan Snell all into the game for NC State Applause hey duana its here at the end as well Applause theres a steal for Chase Graham NC State going to be 292 when Chase Graham plays they should play him more often and turnover stepping out of bounds there for smell the son of Steve snow whos the director of operations Kevin Keats over there encouraging his his team to continue with the pace and a lot of times you want to see these guys be able to get an opportunity to play and always a fan favorite to be able to see them score unless they get a quick shot off here the shot clock is going to be off by the time they get the ball Applause NC State made nine threes in the first 10 minutes of the game tonight Graham deep three if you want to stick back wont go out of bounds off coffin under Kevin Keets will let him shoot here theres still a three second difference between the game and shot clock can a walk on get on the board Juan has gone a walkon do one out of the bucket and hell get fouled by Daniel Titus Applause dont forget doubleheader coming up on these Regional Sports networks tomorrow two really good games Cornell and Miami have two losses combined so far this season hurricanes are really good Championship contenders in the ACC in my opinion and then the nine oclock game tiger tussle at Little John Coliseum preseason CAA favorite Towson taking on Clemson thats gonna be a really good game we talked about Towson being good in Clemson one of those teams was off to a really good start BJ Hall starting it into rare form three wont go final seconds here wolf pack improved the 242 in this building since the turn of the century with a 9472 win over Compton state with so many wolf pack Legends in the house turquavion Smith adding to his wolf pack status 33 points for circavion Smith charquel Joyner added 29 and the Wolf Pack close on a 132 run thanks for being
