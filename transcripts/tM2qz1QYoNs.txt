see a single thing right now Ive seen both coaches turn back and look at me wondering what the heck is going on I dont quite know but what I do know is the vibe here back in my playing days you were scared of the zoo and what they bring the energy this Panthers group feeds off of it tonight no different thats Pitt and Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets has been playing better of late theyve won three of their last four pit saw six game win streak come to an end over the weekend against Detroit or Virginia Tech heres Lance Terry Kyle Sturdivant launches a three the rebound to Nellie Cummings starting lineup for the Pitt Panthers theyve got jamarius Burton ACC Player of the Year candidate Cummings top five in the ACC and assists as Federico Federico misses on the inside so Ive been told Denise Im not allowed to leave here until the Panthers get their first bucket Ive got work to do I promise Im coming but Zoom either Sam at Dustin said Ive got to hang to the first bucket its tradition leave no one behind when it comes to the Oakland Zoo well if you hang there for too long they may kick you out Here Comes Cummins starting lineups for Georgia Tech Miles Kelly with the pink sneakers wearing number 13 the yellow jackets leading scorer Trayvon Franklin coming off three straight double doubles heres Blake Henson bodying inside and the rebound to Kelly Applause is three back iron and I think this might be it right here people behind me are getting angry Im six foot eight blocking Vision Im getting comfortable with the personal space from where I sit theres Burton against Franklin has the mismatch left that one short Applause Franklin on the other end and that is a goaltend against Federico and look Denise she knew this game is going to play fast that thats the tempo thats what coach expected in talking with both both coaches they knew the level of athletes they knew the pace at which its going to be played no surprise theyre going up and down early on Georgia Tech this season has not won a game outside of Atlanta Cummings steps into one no good Georgia Techs only Road win was against intercity rival Georgia State Lance Terry sixth game back after missing four with a hamstring Tex played a lot better since his return Applause shot clock winding down Terry pulls up and go and here comes Henson here struggle late as of late excuse me theyre going to look to activate their guy they want to get the threepoint line going but keep in mind this is Georgia Tech Team the defends a threepoint line better than any team in the ACC Anish and Pitts coming off its worst threepoint shooting performance of the Season just three of 18 in the weekend loss over in Blacksburg look I am neutral Casper but I need a bucket I need to get a seat its hot Ill tell you what Greg Elliott gets fouled on a corner shot free throws do not get you off the hook this is unbelievable Music Music a threeshot foul for Elliott and Kelly Georgia Techs leading scorer and the only Yellow Jacket averaging in double figures picks up two early fouls and I think on these free throws Ive gotten the queue Im going to exit the zoo make my way over to you actually call some basketball if I could make my way through here here we go lets go ahead and head this way might be the safest bet Jordan makes his way back the officials tonight Roger Ayers Brian OConnell Jeff Hartness Greg Elliott scored in double figures and four straight Marquette transfer starting lineup where every player is at least 21 years old for Pitt Applause here we go Im sliding through the Baseline Im making my way over to you my friend make room for the big fella because were gonna have a basketball game tonight Believe It or Not Georgia Tech whos looked very different in their last few games hes come ready to play here on the road Terry leans in nothing Cummings the other way hes had backtoback games with eight assists and he finds Federico good and tear the newspapers up pit with its first field goal at the 17minute Mark all it took was getting Jordan out of the student section Applause all right Im back partner lets talk basketball Debo Coleman whos now 10 of his last 19 from three gives Georgia Tech the lead and its a challenge when youre when youre a pit team and theyve seen it once this season already in Georgia Tech theyre going to throw a lot of different defenses at you make you think on every catch because you dont quite know where that defense is coming from long two for Burton raises the front rim Josh passner employs that fun house with trick mirror defense and youve gotten a taste early on Mrs makes anything Georgia Techs trying to run team that struggles in the half court wants to beat the defense down the floor big size Advantage for Jalen Moore until he ran into Federico Cummins hesitates swivels in the basket plus the foul Federico Keys it with the block Nelly Cummings in the open floor like all great finishers eye on the goal through the contact Pips Duke and North Carolina are down I think where coach Capel was coming from uh mention of the ACC Network aside a building frustration from him and his colleagues on the sidelines in the conference that they feel like theyre not getting the proper respect look if youre a metrics guy youre probably going to disagree with Coach Capel and lean into the numbers but if youve seen historically how this goes you know that people have to walk back their comments up the conference because of how the conference performs in March I would stack the accs best teams to do damage and March up against the SEC up against the big tents Big 12 is a different Beast this season but I like pitch chances I love Miamis chances Virginia NC State these are very dangerous teams in March which makes this conference again a special one Anson pulls the trigger from three Coleman looking to answer the rebound snatched by Elliott Nike cebandi and there for Pitt y had a big game last time versus Georgia Tech really kind of announced himself as that potential Sixth Man of the Year with that 21 Point Outburst the difference last time these two teams met a month ago an 11th Point pit win in Atlanta Cummings Applause shuffled his feet just to finish the thought on where the ACC is it is valid that there may not be as many NBA players in this league as were accustomed to seeing but the way college basketball is trending and youre seeing it with Pitt older teams are having success and the teams at the top of the ACC the Miamis the Virginias the pits older teams and what did we see last year only five teams from this league got into the NCAA tournament as Sturdivant hits three of them got to the elite eight two of them were playing on the final weekend of the Season yeah look and again Caroline is down just this year preseason number one in danger not making the tournament thats going to make people be critical of the ACC because of what Carolina means to him Duke is building so I get it but right now youre watching competitive basketball with a tournament team and a Georgia Tech team thats still going to make you go out and earn a win in the conference because conference games are tough no matter what conference it is yellow jackets of what three out of four after a nine game streak the long loss a game that has some questionable end game officiating it was a onepoint defeat to Wake Forest so Bandy pushing hes really embraced his sixth man role as he said and hes got a chance to take you off the dribble he and Burton give you that oneonone ability but at the same time coach doesnt want the ball to stick Cummings gets the home roll and its 157 Pitt and that would have been one of those scenarios had Cummings missed the shot coach keeper would have been clearing for makeup move to get a better look I do think Savannah Cummings have been doing a little too much dribbling its the best way to attack is through ball movement and then attack again points for coming Franklin with a nice move his last four games hes averaging 13 and 12 big part of that having Lance Terry back in the lineup to alleviate some of that offensive pressure off a guy like Franklin for him to shine Applause Rico traveled this pit roster you match them up against the youngest team in the NBA the Oklahoma City Thunder Man for men the starting five for both teams Pitt has the older player at four of the five positions yeah and thats helped them and quite honestly youre looking at a blueprint to success in college basketball in this new world coach Capel wants to have old guards but he wants to mix that in with new recruits and Mainstays within the program and you know what its worked Franklin nearly lost it Coleman Corner three no battle for the rebound its Franklin working on the glass this is where Pitt is vulnerable on the backboard coach feels like theyve been making steps coach capable that is towards growing there but it shows signs theyre not the biggest team its a place where without questioning missing John Huguley to be down there to rebound theyre gonna have to do it by locating bodies and as a group and that was a mental lapse and foul away from the ball its on Terry his second team good established position there from Franklin again hes been a walking DoubleDouble in these last five games really asserting himself instance three not there rebound to Javon Franklin nearly stolen away foul trouble now a bit of an issue for Georgia Tech Kelly and Terry both with two fouls Kellys on the bench Terry remains in in the lane tossed it up Federico the rebound I like that Lance Terry played off too but he still sped himself up played off too but failed to compose himself with the offering foul before the drive its against Georgia Tech and that is three now on Terry and you saw Savannah he had the match up with Terry went right at him and Lance Terry will now find a seat on the Georgia Tech bench Miles Kelly Techs leading scorer back in with the two fouls yeah and this is not the place Georgia Tech wants to be in with 32 minutes left of competitive basketball they need every offensive weapon possible Applause thank you Comics looking for help shabandi nearly lost it heres Burton over Kelly and thats smooth jamarius Burton has put himself into the conversation for ACC player of the year hes so composed I mean a 5050 basketball after a bad decision from some Bandy gathers plays off too King in the midrange oh boy Moore checked by sebandi shot clock at 10 Kelly tough angle the tip by Franklin its knocked out of bounds it belongs to Pitt the Panthers with a win tonight can get to 20 wins they last did that in 2016 when they last made the NCAA tournament put aside their differences what side of the aisle they sit on know what their their race nationality or Creed is and just hope collectively for a young man who has so much life in front of him to return to being normal again and to see him here at the game we didnt we didnt hear this earlier today at shoot around we got the pleasant surprise right before tipoff to be told he was going to be here and I was surprised his first time back on campus since that scary collapse he looks fantastic sitting right to our left here were gonna get a chance to meet him at halftime excited to be able to do so he got a much deserved Standing Ovation during the commercial break his alma mater with a sixpoint lead on Georgia Tech pit chasing Virginia atop the ACC Elliott 51 from three over his last nine games misfired there Georgia Tech 19 for the threepoint line got to do a little bit more of that probing dribbles give yourself a better look theyre the worst threepoint shooting team at a conference got to find Dynamic ways to get it going not just settle interestingly enough in the January 14th meeting against Pitt Georgia Tech 12 out of 29 from three better than 40 percent the problem and they were below 40 percent from Two and they did not make a single free throw only went to the line three times tonight no free throw attempts for Georgia Tech so in almost 50 minutes against Pitt this season the yellow jackets have not made a free throw and have only attempted three meanwhile in that first contest Pitt won 17 of 20 from the freethrow line because they couldnt get the threepoint shot going and that is one of the successful or positive things for Georgia Tech this season theyre the best at defending the three in the conference Applause Burton just the first team foul on pit Holmen at a 20point game against Virginia Tech last week shot clock down to six and the three is there from Miles Kelly didnt love the screening action I think Georgia Tech needs to be more physical to create advantages on their ball screens but they did show signs of a rhythm and movement to create the Baseline three Applause Burton lobbing it inside and the block by Franklin on the Freshman Guillermo Diaz grabbed thank you thats where the big fellow will show signs of growth in the off season lets build up that body get in the weight room highly skilled him and his brother High ceilings thats a sign of how far they need to go still and well get a foul on the perimeter it is on Diaz Graham his first Georgia Tech Applause right from Franklin but now you commit the defender and Elliott you swing a baseline you get a three good threepoint look you got to put some pressure on that defense try to put them in challenging positions to make the decision Elliott made the wrong one pick out the Baseline three Applause Franklin gives it back to Moore tough angle ran out of real estate and here comes Pitt Hensons looking for the three he wants it Hanson catch release Splash you can see Henson coming across the timeline hes wired to knock down the three ball had his hands in the pocket great field from Cummings to swing across Court catch deliver punctually Henson began his career at Ole Miss where he was a twoyear starter and transferred to Iowa State but never played a game there went two years without playing due to a medical condition thats been undisclosed all hes done hes come to pit averaged 15 and a half the game hes their top rebounder he can shoot it from the outside and hes got the build of so many pit forwards ontariolet Chevy Troutman he is the poster child of what a pit forward should look like yeah but as much as I loved into Ontario and Chevy although I hate it when I played against him but great dudes they couldnt shoot the three ball like Henson does hits in good defensive position and then hes chasing going the other side secondary break presents himself and weve seen it time and time again great sequence both defensively and the shot making ability of Blake Henson Applause Cummings a former all Patriot League selection over at Colgate Applause shot clock at three Burtons got to put it up step back Music offensive rebound Federico Elliott was calling for it instead its Cummings and the three rattles out Kelly on the drive got the step out Santos this Georgia Tech Team it looked like it may have given its head coach a sign in early January they knock off a ranked Miami team Josh passner thought of the time that could be a springboard instead it turned into nine straight losses following that game and that is a huge blow to Georgia Tech a team that doesnt have a ton of offensive weapons four fouls in the first half you can question Josh pastner leaving him in there but right now with Davon Smith injured with Tristan Maxwell not here theyre just arent a ton of offensive options for Tech but thats a betrayal of trust from Lance Terry if coach says Hey because were shorthanded we need you out there play smart thats a terrible decision from Lance Terry a guy in the last two games that has averaged 16 and a half points hes needed on the floor now hes got four and they have to show Russell fell out in the first half Burton the runner Applause now youve got Miles Kelly out there hes got two fouls so dont be surprised if pit tries to get Kelly in more foul trouble part of the story in the first goround Pitt was able to get to the freethrow line be the more physical group to hold on to a comfortable Applause Kelly against the smaller Cummins sturdivance nice move to hit from 15 a series of handoffs generating momentum to discover a way to get into the painted area that is essential for Georgia Tech to have any type of offensive success Applause Music Santos was open on the screen and roll Cummings said no Applause Santos in the high post spins inside drops it off Federico forces it up able to draw the foul Santos did a good job getting in a painted area drawing two and then dishing speaking of getting into the painted area Georgia Tech did a good job of trading off to get a look inside the painted area I mean thats what theyre going to have to do you see Kelly handed off to sternovan to try and generate something downhill they dont necessarily have the guys that can always get there themselves so I like the offensive approach Federico Federico sophomore junior college transfer born in Cairo Egypt grew up in Helsinki Finland and his potential is immense hes just starting to scratch the surface of what he can be last few games last three averaging in double figures almost eight rebounds and a couple of blocks you know what makes a team a good one a tournament Team guys championing their roles they call him fetty Federico Federico Rim runs hes going to protect hes going to be a guy in the dunker position hes going to make himself a receiver for easy twos Kelly knocks it down its now become essential that Kelly can provide that offense with Terry saddle with four and no Smith on the trip out with injury Music Applause ancient cracking down Coleman Henson dips it off the glass Federico the rebound put back no Kelly sues for the rebound Applause foreign Applause starting to heat up a little bit hes got six points three of six from the field a onepoint lead for Pitt foreign Applause we have a doubleheader Tuesday in Charlottesville at 7 Eastern number six Virginia hosting Clemson the Tigers no longer and Joe linardis projected field and then its Virginia Tech taking on a Louisville team thats shown a little fight of late yeah they ran into a buzz saw there at Duke but youre still seeing a group thats starting to get a better feel for the game and what coach Paynes trying to do there yeah Louisville we were there last Wednesday when they almost took down Virginia had a chance to win on their final possession and then this rock off Clemson yeah I mean not to Clemson out of the projected field yeah but Clemsons got opportunity still dont be Twisted by that narrative they still have a chance if theyre gonna do a lot of winning a lot down the stretch thank you Applause Kelly from 18 Miles Kelly has 10 points he leads Georgia Tech and the yellow jackets have taken the lead with four and a half to go in the first half with Kelly at 66 and his ability and skill set hes got to hunt the basketball and soon from the outside hes got nine his third three foreign Applause for three back iron Franklin tips the rebound to Moore who lays it in I love the fight of Georgia Tech right now in this game they have played tough they have chased 50 50s they have played downhill they are challenging this pit group on their own home floor Jeff Capel said it very plainly to us this is not the same Georgia Tech team that Pitt played a month ago sabandi the driving kick Elliott looking for help bounces it down low Federico has blocked Applause and the call is a foul Georgia Tech Miles Kelly starting to heat up gets the midrange going hes got 10 and then how about the loose ball and its more divide Us but make us stronger and Jordan you took a foray during the open into the Oakland Zoo traded well there yeah theyre nicer than I remember look when I was playing at Notre Dame Pitt was in the Big East when you came here you knew look youre gonna play some big time names and Brandon Knight Julius page weve mentioned uh Chevy Troutman Carl krauser I could keep going through the list of guys I dont know if Ontario let played here I think he was at the old building but just tough guys but she knew that they were going to bring up the Sixth Man in the zoo they knew your girlfriends name I didnt even remember my girlfriends middle name they knew it Id be your moms middle name too I bet right and I try to tell him they dont listen but theyre so passionate here and its everything thats right about the college basketball game theyre invested and its great to see Pitt basketball back along with the zoo whos showing up for every game this season Applause one of the best stories in the ACC the Resurgence of Pitt Kelly from the outside short student section and a crowd that in this building for a number of years now has been Dorman looking for a sign of Life boy this place has come back to life here in this 20222023 season Georgia Techs played a clean first half no turnovers went less than three minutes to go meanwhile for the five turnovers they force theyve generated nine points allowing them to get out in the open floor Georgia Tech executing with the pieces that they currently have to play to shoot Moore is going to have to put it up blocked by Federico hes third in the ACC in swats those are the decisions those are the decisions that are hurting him and there it is on the other side Jalen Moore sending shock waves through the peak a perfect illustration of whats been going on in this first half mindnumbing decisions with the basketball that have generated leak outs the other way for a Georgia Tech team that struggles to score in a half court yet theyre being given these easy ones 11 points off turnovers for Georgia Tech none for Pitt because Georgia Tech hasnt turned it over Burke the strong Drive thats all day Burton at his best when he gets downhill gets the defender on his hip leans into him with a little bit of body thats an old man move from a veteran basketball players played a lot Moses Malone used to have a line when asked about his style he said I goes to the wreck yeah that was to the rack Nordstrom Style Franklin oh and thatll be a foul Franklin out here trying to cancel Christmas Applause I mean thats how you gotta attack especially link and he saw that it wasnt Federico excuse me once you know it wasnt Federico he said I got Burton Ive got a chance Burton nodded his head he said Im not going to be a poster this evening that is two fouls now on Burton yeah foreign Applause basketball on the ACC Network Thursday Miami and Louisville and then its number 11 Duke at home against NC state coach Lawsons done a great job with that Duke Squad Applause foreign Applause they understand that initial thrust is coming from pitt a team that pursues quick offense Georgia Techs getting back theyre getting on guys theyre contesting and theyre rebound more for three that does not go just four of 31 from Deep entering today Applause all five players on the floor for Pitt transfers Henson coming down the lane and against this Georgia Tech length you got to use head fakes and go bounce pass get Telegraph it but they get one here can they get a stop before the half and build about an 18 second differential between game clock and shot clock as Federico picks up his second again you see Elliots going to try and go over the top to Federico you cant with Franklin there that simply hits it right place right time but those have been the turnover prone plays that this pit teams been making just happened to dodge one there Allman to inbound and hes got to use it time out Applause well be back in 30 seconds pit with a threepoint lead Music three keys for this evening get to 70 points defend the three and transition defense well Georgia Tech on that last part has not given up anything in transition against the three Pitt is four of eleven 36 percent getting to 70 theyll need a little more in the second half yeah but aside from Henson who theyve lost a few times youve done a decent job there as well look pitch 36 thats good but theyre not being devastated final ticks Cummings weeps through the defense drops it off and no good from Diaz grab Franklin again making a winning play Help side gets back in time to recover to make the deflection from the Diaz Graham offering impressive effort from Georgia Tech and it hit its peak in that last sequence how do the yellow jackets keep this close keep getting back to transition keep child it has been a factor down low Big Time finish the half with the block down low to save a basket a momentum for them really heading to the break can he channel that for the next 20 companies likes this matchup he likes that matchup Franklin using those long arms to stay with him now Burton pretend to shoot Kurt on the drive kicks it back out Hinson spots up and its clean Coleman made the mistake of turning his back on one of the hottest Shooters in the conference and a guy whos having himself an item Blake Henson regrettable decision Henson makes him pay Kelly at the other end man that goes in so the two offensive stars in the first half pick up where they left off and Elliott crunched over for Pitt and you were going to watch Coleman defensively here he goes digs down and you cant leave a shooter and Henson that dick down decision from Coleman proved costly meanwhile on the other side the handoff defense well it wasnt a defense Elliot looked like he got caught somewhere which kept him from going there to defend and left the open look looks to be in some serious pain and officials going to the monitor to see if it was a foul quick decision it must have been incidental contact for them to look that quickly oh yeah that was just incidental contact Crossfire with Jalen Moore Moore must be a physical presence because Elliot came off of him definitely slider a frame but Elliott lost that battle in the Collision Elliott remains in the game is starting five for Pitt four players average in double figures Georgia Tech only has one player on the team who averages thats Miles Kelly as Federico finishes with ease its a good look over the top to float it down to Federico to establish good position and now theyre going to extend it out Pitt wants to speed this thing up a little bit more they want to try and get some of those live ball turnovers go the other way Applause Kelly from three and another one for Miles Kelly whos up to 16 now feeling hes getting his feet set the defense has not been around not respecting him from there and hes made him pay a few times four threes for Kelly won off with career high Elliott Music Henson Federico the offensive rebound The Cutting Elliott the Marquette transfer stuffed they want to contact fishes believe more got it clean Applause I got you gotta find Miles Kelly right hes had the hot hand hes got 16 Sturtevant smooth into Georgia Tech with a twopoint lead I mean Pitt the struggles to guard have bled into this game against a lesser offensive opponent in Georgia Tech thats problematic Cummings back iron Federico gobbles up the loose ball Henson thought about it he lost it comes back to Burton Elliott Deadeye still not sexy its not an ideal possession a lot of chaos but it ended up in a right place thanks to the Past fake of Ellie a timeout by Jeff cable who lamented his teams defensive effort Saturday against Virginia Tech three its got some really clean looks from there and thats why hes connected like he has for this group hes got 16 points hes paying down several threes and theyre starting to play through him right now four of eight from distance six of 11 for the field 16 points and with Lance Terry out with Davon Smith not making the trip due to injury with no Tristan Maxwell Miles Kelly says all good jump on my shoulders guys Ill bring you home Josh pastner has only played six players so far one of them Terry as the four fouls Applause third Advance has given this team some nice minutes now more in the paint and gets the roll towards the tech by one I have not seen a retreat triple yet from Georgia Tech downhill downhill downhill where is the resistance are the Panthers going to make them meet a chest at any point tonight now I know the pit teams you played against different story Applause we still got some battle wounds for those days oh yeah those those guys were dogs this Panthers group has that in them Kelly from the outside more battling for the rebound its won by Elliott Burton pushing thats around Sturdivant over to Elliott his three offline out of bounds last touch Georgia Tech how about the effort from Federico hes been chasing every ball when it greens off that Rim put himself in position to try and make something happen but again just defensively more disable Burton was almost there but almost wasnt good enough because more is unrelenting as are his teammates and trying to attack that rip Nike sabandi have 21 against Georgia Tech and the win last month Applause shot clock down to six Ellie Cummins against the bigger Coleman driving twisting a minute out to Savannah there would have counted if it went nope they ruined a shot clock violation Georgia Tech according to scare into one of the top teams in the AC have identified February 18th through the 26th as ACC Unity week and you want to talk about Unity there is DeMar Hamlin who brought a country together you had a chance to spend a couple of moments with him at halftime and interestingly enough Tyler Boyd former pit wide receiver who plays for the Bengals and was part of that Monday night bills Bengals game also in the house and those two shared a moment earlier yeah those two are friends I got a chance to know Tyler a little bit finally got a chance to meet tomorrow and its just an inspiration a lot of people going through things in their life and to see resiliency of Him Live In the Flesh was uh pretty special and uplifting for me personally I gotta admit that kind of emotional scene and hes sitting just a few seats down from us and theres a positivity emanates from his Aura all the kids all the fans who were coming up to him at halftime he smiled took a picture for pretty much everybody there Cummings the turnaround good spacing allowed for Cummings to attack a gap Applause Applause Jalen Moore Applause backing down Hinson stays with him to travel first turnover for Georgia Tech more than 25 minutes thats incredible thats incredible look they averaged about 12 turnovers a game so nothing gaudy but thats remarkable for a team thats as down with personnel as they are in the season theyve had a team that came into this game just three and 13 in conference away from the city of Atlanta they have not won a game this season The Ledger says 18 on the road but the one road to win against Georgia state which plays in the city of Atlanta Sturdivant drops it off at four drops it in just a good sequence third event getting into the painted area more cutting from that Baseline Sturdivant drawing two and fine Applause comments 10 points four assists Elliott Applause Savannahs been quiet today shot clock running down Elliott for three does not get at the rebound by Miles Kelly Music Coleman catch and release no good up ahead Elliott ahead of the patch and he beats Coleman Jack Campbell wanted a foul Georgia Tech pushes the other way ton of contact maybe they thought he was after the play Kelly wide open his fifth three Pitt caught up in the action of what they thought was a foul and left ball watching an out of position for Miles Kelly to knock down another three Applause the five threes for Kelly ties a career high hits it tipped into the air snatched by Franklin Music sturdivance a lot of dribbling gives it up Coleman using his size against the smaller Cummins Elliott came over to help Franklin down low and great awareness by Nemo Coleman and when ellia came to recklessly helped it created chaos guys then had to pick down low which bookend on the Block to guard leaving One open for a layup Georgia Tech team playing much better the last four games theyve won three of them locked down low Federico and were going to foul on Moore who went for the block the yellow jackets with a fourpoint lead well thats the 12 minutes to go in regulation metrics provide enough opportunities in front of them to secure the the very next night they can go get it you just got to take care of it you got to take care of business here on your own floor its as simple as that its a downtron Georgia Tech team that that is to their credit not giving up on the season but if youre a tournament team you got to prove it here on your home floor uh we were talking to shoot around when you look at the way this pit team is built the pieces fit so well they have the look of a second weekend team you just dont want to give people a reason in the end of February you just have to be paranoid paranoia means you got to go when games youre supposed to win I really dont think we should be talking about Fitness regard but its the reality of the landscape currently with the brackets Chef Greenberg heard you and hes about to build his therapist again clock violation thats huge because Ive not seen Pitt make a statement with their defense tonight or in the last loss versus Virginia Tech a move like that take a look at time and score good turn to time for Pitt played what Jeff cable called its worst defensive game against Virginia Tech over the weekend at Toms Subway turnstile defense down low as Federico was able to draw the foul Federico Federico sophomore who came over from northern Oklahoma junior college hes been a defensive presence all season and of late were starting to see more offense out of Federico does a good job of carving out real estate on a low block the next step of evolution for him is softening the hands and getting that delivery right with the basketball better finish amongst trafficking through content Music he is seven of seven at the freethrow line make it eight out of eight and it was just a 58 free throw shooter coming into the game free throw disparity 12 attempts for Pitt two for Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets have had just five free throws two games against Pitt Ed 49 Franklin download of Moore and he is clobbered no more just camped out on that low block and said Savannah show me you can guard I got the side its an advantage Im a little bit more physical and he won before the catch quite frankly Jalen Moore part of a sophomore class with Kelly and Debo Coleman that Josh passner hopes could be the new core of this program the way it was with Devoe and Alvarado and Moses Wright Applause womens lacrosse North Carolina the number one team in the nation taking on Virginia Tech Friday at 7 Eastern right here on the ACC Network I dont know if you know this Jordan but Charlotte North is a womans lacrosse analyst for the ACC Network this year shes like a Michael Jordan womens Lacross the Diana Taurasi of womens lacrosse and since three not there no exactly who

the tomahawk on the contact but heres Burton in isolation Advantage one of the best scores in the conference on the other end Miles Kelly on the drive Applause you a lot of play I dont know theres a body with the left guide hand but the way the games been played so far I think theres no whistle there its its a bang bang play but when youre looking yeah you do you know what left hand from somebody thats the right call he used that left guide hand to come down above the shot theres enough contact to want to wish him both free throws good afterwards attack back up by one less than nine and a half to play Franklin pokes that away it comes back to Henson Burton wants the screener Federico sets it Cummins down the lane the dropoff Federico Federico with a little boob shape the right spot again

got up on him but a heady play by Burt knowing his Defender was a foul away from fouling out took it strong to the basket gets the goaltend and Pitt extends the lead to four dead and the nightmare of real things for Jordan right here man Chevy Troutman just gave Jordan a shoulder for old time so this guy right here I mean this guy was a problem and this is where coach Cape wants to get the program back to guys like this they are the ones who set the foundation in those early 2000s of what they want this program to be moving forward Chevy was a dog Chevy youre too old man let your body go a little bit I need to be doing situps and pushups man hes into the old age bro its all right Laughter yeah brother beloved figure here in the steel city here in this Arena Applause yellow jackets down by four Terry driving on sabandi Brown wants to travel three Marina key thats great three of the key thats great defense and the discipline a bit defensively here down the stretch its keyed there offense but look at Savannah doesnt bite doesnt bite does it by turnover its a great individual defensive you okay you were a little scarred when he pulled up next door Im sweating yeah I didnt expect to see Chevy out here said hes living in Pittsburgh Applause Here Comes Bert to the basket and missed the bunny again Terry was there Burton Saw it that was the health Defender thats a great decision Kelly that three rolls out in Center pushing for Pitt Applause thats not Hensons game thats not Hensons game and he opened the floor I mean the the defense of anticipation oh I mean Coleman was moving he wasnt in position but the elbow created from Henson warned to that was out of control Music position wasnt proper for Coleman it was the elbow to create the the attempt to create the space that got the whisper so Bandy picks up Sturdivant full court Kellys got 21 to equal a career high Applause Hanson got away with a foul shot clock at seven Coleman for three offensive rebound Franklin kicks it out to Sturdivant one more Terry a rebound by sabendi Applause some Bandy on the drive and a foul on the floor and if thats on Terry it is I dont know if he is done anytime Terry has picked up the man with the ball we have seen Pitt attack attack and he never was able to really establish any sort of Rhythm in this game because he got in foul trouble so very early I mean its a guy averaging 16 and a half the last two before that he dropped 19 I mean the guy had provided a ton for them just that early foul trouble he could never get right tonight and heres now the danger down the stretch for Josh passner Terrys been parked on the bench most of the game Georgia Techs only played six players and theyre extended out showing those tracks once you see two three bodies come you gotta find a way to distribute the basketball because clearly theres an advantage we have Benson recovers off the window 16 for the junior good job from Henson managing as a receiver that mid post where this defense junk defense or not is most vulnerable foreign Applause and the six threes tonight also a career high just confident on The Catch and Release wasting no time knows what he wants to do with that basketball thats let it block Applause s points on two of ten when these two played last month Burton kicks to Cummins the quarter three and runners in another winning play for Burt looks the defense off kicks it to coming sort of Baseline grooms starting to come together offensively and that threepoint line becoming a weapon once more four of the Five pit starters and double figures so Bandy all over Sturtevant unnecessary a region on Burton his third Music Miles Kelly have yourself a night in the steel city the Baseline bomb he gets it to go it says cool anything you can do we can do better Burt finds Cummings for Jeff cable year five this is his first winning season Pitt has had six straight losing Seasons which is unthinkable for the vast majority of the howl in the dictionary they lived in the top this was odd you knew Pitt was going to come to play its restoring that order here with Coach Capel and the job hes done assembling this roster but building the culture in the season as well and a foul on Federico that is four on the big guy and Pittsburgh three minutes and 21 seconds away from a 20th win this season the last time Pitt won 20 you got to go back to the 20152016 season Jamie Dixon was still the head coach and that was the last pit team to go to the NCAA tournament Sturdivant over sebandi yes Georgia Tech refuses to go quietly they made some big time Shots tonight points five assists for Sturtevant they might have to go look at this Applause Music his second taking away the cutting lane from Blake Henson but how about Sturdivant Rhythm dribble theyre not going to respect him with the contests feels good lets it Fly Josh passner told us we got to score 70 its probably going to take at least that bucket has made Seven of its last eight from the field screen and roll not there with Federico shot clock at seven Cummings against Franklin Cummings fouled on the way up and what youre seeing is whats defined pit basketball this season a resiliency theyve taken body blows put these guards Burton Cummings sabandi start to make the necessary plays to try and protect this lead and protect this home floor this evening we showed you the graphic earlier these are grown men Cummings is 24 Burton is 22 and since 23 and what does that result in close games a whole lot of Ws and one lone l there look people may get tired of the references to those pit teams with Alan and Dixon but look to find them were physical guards physical play and an older group those are Prep School guys that have come in there and led that team and so you knew come game winning time those guys were going to be the best versions of themselves and thats what this pit team has been this season now youre getting a reminder tonight that was an old school Armada a bowling ball shouldered bullets foreign TS 220 to go Sturdivant driving on sabandi picked up the dribble thats it back thats a three off the side of the rim Kelly cannot keep it in Balance Pitt is really tightened up defensively couple lapses Georgia Techs made a couple shots but theyve had to work for it in a different manner here down the stretch what have they been doing theyve been communicating theyve been fighting theyve been switching theyve been contesting theyve kept guards in front Applause thank you Comics driving on Coleman hits it for three and score 19 for hits in the lead pitch what a bounce back performance from Hudson and it makes himself a receiver when coming stribling into Trump big time Franklin the other way down for more and thats on Federico and his fifth hes done thats a foul I mean its a foul its an aggressive move coming down a baseline to draw contact how about Cummings here triples into No Mans Land picks up his dribble but Hinson does a good job of swinging right into his view to catch and do what he does best bang down the three meanwhile Moore yeah he went at the body there was some body there theres enough body for a whistle is it egregious no but because the aggressive move for more that warrants the whistle and Federicos done for the night Jalen Moore one for two at the line tonight 69 percent of the season Georgia Tech not a good freethrow shooting team 66 percent as a team and thats where you talk about closing games Pitt has a bevy of talented freethrow Shooters Elliott Cummings burton all north of 80 percent that can close the game down the stretch weve also got old guys that dont get rattled and those old guys having to be guards who control the basketball in winning time thats a separator thats a big miss it makes it a three possession game Commons will milk some clock companys going to try and get into the painted area here he has seven assists he had eight and his previous two games five to shoot Cummings for three the rainbow not there Kelly has the board Applause Sturdivant down the lane as the tapes uses the window to his fivepoint game 50 seconds left you still gotta stay within who youve been down the stretch cant give up a quick one that easy all the way down Broadway for the layup gotta have more resistance Ellie Cummings another one of those cards who time and time again has made some big time plays they needed him to elevate his game as the storm clearly hes done that at points throughout the entire season you want me to go hes hot in here I cant do that what a Nelly Cummings has made some big time plays though to be the difference here down the stretch but thats who they are multifaceted it can be one of four or five guys that can give you nearly 20 to be the guy who earns them the win I thought wed get a Shimmy Shimmy Cocoa Puff from you know and Nelly I mean look Nelly was the dude back when we were coming up wearing that same age bracket hey 70 to 65 and Georgia Tech might have to pick up a couple of fouls here only five team fouls so they still have one foul to give before Pitt would enter the bonus Music this pit team picked 14th in the ACC out of 15 it has been seventh season since their last NCAA tournament appearance its been more than seven years since theyve been ranked in the AP poll frankly a little absurd they havent been ranked at any point this season right now A projected 10 seed a loss to Georgia Tech now that is a big black mark on your resume you win you hold serve and you continue to stay a game behind Virginia in the ACC race as well take care of the basketball make your free throws if youre the Panthers live to see another day held by Coleman passenger cant believe it and Greg Elliott and 88 free throw shooter but its only the sixth team foul so they might go to the monitors they might look at the monitor here because of the level of contact I mean there was nothing it should be a quick review from Roger Ayers here theyre going to do their due diligence just for how Elliott fell to the ground now part of that too Debo Colemans not a small guy hes six six but there was no contact with one in that face and thats what we would have assumed and it was more the cell from Elliot hey they got us they got his arms his forearms but he sold it like there might have been contact to the face to check for a flagger and one or two quick review back to basketball just the way we like it from this Elite officiating crew this evening so the next foul by Georgia Tech and Pitt would go to the line for a one and one dangerous pass stolen away Sturdivant his pass on the ground and comes back to Elliott now Burton pushes across over to Hinson and theyll pull it back with Cummings precious and Georgia Tech finally fouls I mean Jalen Moore who commits the foul but how many seconds ran off the clock well Burton got found very egregiously right in front of the snow whistle but this this decision in the backcourt Elliott a lot of air time on that one sternovan almost had themselves a play but again pip finds a way to get themselves out of trouble with an air pass Ellie Cummings with 18 points tonight perfect at the free throw line three for three on the season he is 3944 at the strike almost automatic Applause Sylvania native threw up a pit fan wanted to come here didnt have the opportunity out of high school went to Bowling Green for a year Colgate for four where he was a twotime all Patriot League selection now he has been the Maestro of this offense running point for Pitt both free throws good the lead is seven and a timeout by Jeff cable with 327 remaining as coach capable in the recruiting as you mentioned Nelly economys native of Pittsburgh dream to come here said what he was recruiting him to come over and said that was really easy we asked guys about him that we knew we could trust that would tell us the truth about it and the truth was hes an exemplary young man hes perfect for your program hell make you better and hell be great in the locker room and being great in the locker room matters greatly here at Pitt because coach Capel has got a lot of talent to come through here but the locker room was the issue with some of those early teams that prevented them from winning the talent Remains the connectivity in the locker room is a different positive vibe this year thats put them in position to go do damage in March now especially when you go into the transfer portal weve seen it many times teams load up on transfers and they might be talented players the chemistry isnt there especially behind the scenes and Seasons go off rails absolutely not this unit connected Applause pushes across triggering down the lane rebound Cummings hes fouled by Franklin and Nelly Cummins who grew up just 45 minutes outside of the city has a chance to seal it from the freethrow line look its been a great fight from Georgia Tech tonight they just ran out of gas playing essentially whats been five and a half guys this evening in a 40minute contest they just didnt have what was necessary to close it out credit to bit for not to fold when the pressure started to really present itself but you have to be impressed with the Georgia Tech team that hasnt given up on their season either Applause 21 points for Cummings that matches his high water mark and ACC play he had 21 against North Carolina and now hes got 22 largest lead of the game for Pitt final 20 seconds Kelly from the logo passes it off to Sturtevant is good 7468 to possession game 16 seconds to go and again pit still on the 11 with Georgia Tech Having Eight team fouls yeah look theres still time left miss a free throw its a two possession game most especially without Georgia Tech shot it from three percentages in great theyve connected on nine of them miles Kellys obviously will be the story from 3 613 there but Sturtevant now has a pair as well got to take care of the basketball off your pit making their free throws goes without saying 17 of 18 nearly 95 percent from there you can move on the sideline Music Applause Cummings Elliott sabandi and Burton all better than 84 percent from the free throw line and all of them are on the floor and as you look right now Pitt just one game out of first place rooting for a Miami loss if youre a pit fan and a Virginia loss and also third place becomes first place if they can win out through the regular season a tall task no question Elliott has to burn a timeout so pitting now out of timeouts Georgia Tech does not have a timeout left Applause with a win Pitt would get to 20 wins for the first time in seven seasons the Panthers would stay within a game of Virginia now the Cavaliers still have to play North Carolina still have to play Clemson and even though those two teams have hit a bit of his skid you think about whats at stake for Carolina and Clemson a win against Virginia probably puts you back on the right side of the bubble yeah yeah for Carolina maybe even clubs it for yeah but I think more eyes are going right now to that Carolina team given that they are the preseason number one look Ive said this before Clemson still has a chance to get in this thing and theyve earned that right with the season that theyve had a regrettable lost to Louisville no question but all is not lost if this team can get back to defending coach brownells calling card and his older group that has been in that system can get back to executing and competing for 40 Carolina has that Virginia opportunity Duke could be that quad one depending up they can slide up into the third in range that one being at Carolina opportunity for these teams that are On The Fringe and if they get in equally as dangerous as the rest of them in the conference quite honestly Pitt closes with Syracuse thats at home theyre expecting a sellout Notre Dame for Mike Brays final home game with the Irish before closing on the road against Miami and we get a foul before the ball was inbounded its on Sturdivant it will send Burton to the line 11 for jamarius Burke 84 from the free throw line Burton tonight only 10 points Henry rebounds three assists he hasnt forced it a whole lot coach passers pleaded for the hook and hold which would be huge if they go to the Monitor and look hes going to get his wish here I believe see upon the inbound there was the hook and hole Applause I dont know he might be onto something here with Burton and thats what sturdivance is saying too he might be onto something here with Burton hell be interesting to see this one is going to be close theyre gonna put all eyes on this one he comes down he digs in by definition thats a hook and hole Applause you see Josh Pastor saying can we at least take a look Applause and this could drastically change things now we live in the world of metrics and net rankings and people look at records you take a closer look and watch the games in the ACC Georgia Tech improved Louisville playing much better yeah these games hurt you if you lose to them its not the same teams that we saw earlier this season and I think theyre gonna still still waiting for confirmation but I think theyre not going to go ultimately with the hook and hold it its tight were going to wait and see here they may just be looking at adjusting the clock Applause I think that is what theyre gonna do I dont think they see the hook at all Applause so the call romantic say theres a common foul against Sturdivant and a 11 coming for Burton which took that part away its leading scorer jamarius Burke free throw makes this a three possession game its a one and one hit on the season 76 percent as a team at the freethrow line tonight 18 out of 19 its big its how you close these games leave nothing a chance Music Applause as a team from the strike everybody Kelly lost it Burton dumps it ahead to Henson and thatll do it for the first time in Seven Seasons pit has won 20 games the last time pit 120 they went to the NCAA tournament and the Panthers remain with
