in a team whos four and five man can spread the floor and make threes theyre an excellent passing and cutting team and theyve been on a fivegame losing streak so they are hungry this is going to be a really good game big news for the Hokies Hunter Couture is back theres six three senior Sharpshooter they have really missed him they lost every game and he was out best cutter best perimeter Defender having Couture back in the lineup means they can stretch the defense even further getting 40 percent from threepoint land when healthy and we are underway here Virginia at 133 ranked number 10 in the country Virginia Tech starting out in mantoman theyre a good mantoman team they play with their heels on the threepoint line theyre a Bend but dont break defense Clark on the penetration dishing downstairs that Applause with the first basket thats where Kihei Clark is so dangerous anytime he gets into the paint you would rather force him to finish then pass he is an excellent passer and just finds people Santa Claus is a guy whos really coming into his own and developing into a key guy for Tony Bennett isnt he well Tony Bennett has gone smaller with this lineup Kaden Shedrick not in the lineup Ben founder Place who can also stretch the floor transferred in from Ohio and vonderplas is playing extraordinarily well over his last couple of games averaging over 16 points close to eight rebounds Okies coming in 116 15 in the conference as Jay mentioned trying to stop the bleeding heres Couture launches the shot clock was winding down and it never got to the iron well you give credit there to Reese Speakman for blowing up that handoff to Hunter Couture first and further off on the floor one of the best defenders in the country Franklin will swing here Veronica will give it up for Clark its 38 in his own right from threepoint land Franklin down the lane a little scoop shot that wont drop Justin mutz with the rebound one of the most versatile players in the country hes going to play a key role in this game and hes got to look to score at every opportunity Alex outside hes been chilly with his jump shot they need him to get started butts will swing right down the lane and basily will draw the foul Grant basili at six nine hell take the hit bound to fly with number one that was made possible by getting the ball into the post to Justin mutts he draws a double team and then basily very intelligently cut right down the pipe to the basket anytime mutts has the ball hes going to draw a double team in the post the Brazil hes coming off a terrific game in a loss at Syracuse 26 points 10 rebounds the transfer from Wright State hes proven to be a real good fit for the Hokies well twotime all Horizon League at Wright State he scored close to 1500 points and he had 30 points and 10 rebounds in his debut at Virginia Tech and hes got to be aggressive looking for a shot because he can space the floor does a lot of ghost screening popping off of screen roll situations and he can really be a dangerous player well Bennett quickly gets Ryan Dunn The Talented freshman into the game back up top for Franklin off the fake heres the long one coming and that wont drop for Kihei we really have to stay on down on shot fakes against Virginia Kihei Clark great with shot fakes and you saw Armon Franklin get a Defender off the floor and that really opens things up Virginia makes 39 percent beyond the threepoint line neither one of these teams turns the ball over its a headline when they do silly in the lane and denied a terrific play by the youngster The Freshman making an immediate impact hes going to be one of those in time hes doing well Ryan Dunn but hes going to be one of those great fourman Defenders under Tony Bennett Franklin with the finish the 64 senior one of the five starters Tony Bennett returned from last years team to missed the NCAA tournament and already the pressure that Virginia is putting on is bothering Virginia Tech pushing him further out on the floor that never got there and picked up by Gardner this is not the start that Mike young wanted to see with turning the ball over this is a low turnover team but you cannot let Virginia at home win the turnover battle card with a second effort Franklin making a move what a move it was indeed for two a lot of contact on that shot but Virginia doing a very good job of cutting to open space and making themselves available Armon Franklin 12 points a game and another pick heres Clark up against Padula hell lay it in and getting this place rocking and rolling right away when you show the ball against Kihei Clark he is so alert to how you dribble it when you make a hand change with your back turned hes going to take it away just an excellent steal Big Time defensive play by one of the best defenders in the country in Kihei Clark medulla way downtown but that clangs away hope hes only turned it over about 10 times a game Virginia slightly less than that theyre both in the top ten fewers turnovers in the country on the Move Beekman tough Drive with a terrific start here for the Cavaliers thats been a great environment already a lot of celebrities we will ID them as well and Virginia loving the early one of the many things that makes Kihei Clark such a valuable player out on the floor is his defense and his anticipation because of the pressure he gets up underneath you as soon as you make a turn and change hands with the ball and show the ball hes alert enough to be able to knock it away and take it the other way and thats going to make Sean Padula whos an excellent Handler an excellent point guard a little bit more guarded with the ball and that makes it more difficult to run offense he is one of the peskiest most difficult Defenders to go against because he gets so low Dave he plays down in a stance and he gets up underneath you and hes stronger than he looks Kia Clark is a really strong guard he was even when you played against him yeah I played against him he was a freshman when I was a senior he has been around forever he is number one alltime at Virginia in games played in minutes when he decided to come back this last year he didnt have to come back had that coveted year went into Tony Bennetts Office and asked him hey can I come back and I think Tonys answer was pretty Swift yes yes please that would be great AJ Collins a freshman from Mike young into the game Couture with a fake Collins has scuffled from threepoint land but not on that one he had only been five for 30 before that a really good cut by Hunter Couture to just fade off that little screen action and then I think MJ Collins has to be a little quicker in his decision to shoot that ball he was wide open take it right away fourstar recruit out of Clover South Carolina Applause not as much as you see not as much pressure on the ball for Virginia Tech as there are when theyre oh how about done with that rebound and takes a hit as well as he made the shot you were talking about him in the pregame just watching him shoot going around the perimeter and you were raving about the potential of this kid well hes going to be a great player and anytime you get into rotation because Collins let Reese Speakman get past him all of a sudden you got to bring over another Defender bazilly comes over and then theres nobody to block out Ryan Dunn Ryan Dunn 68 hes got a seven foot wingspan long arm Defender really versatile on the defensive end so he can switch out on just about everybody and just great bounce skill level improving hes going to be one of those Isaiah Wilkins type you know DeAndre Hunter type four men for Tony Bennett as he matures heading to the bench with the personal and a couple of changes for Bennett Clark goes off and so does Gardner and Kaden Shedrick is on and so is Isaac McNeely a 64 freshman and Isaac McNeely and West Virginia can really shoot at his last five games 13 of 23 from three hes only got one twopoint field goal during that period lofting it up to Couture and a nice answer there where they need a lot more of that he missed the last four games with that left elbow injury to say they have missed him and understatement an understatement and you notice no hesitation on that shot doesnt have to dip it just catches it at the numbers and hes up with it right away hes been looking inside up top now Franklin long distance and hits it just steps away from the great Steph Curry whos watching Courtside tonight Armon Franklin has been hot his last six games 40 from three averaging close to 16 a game over that period Im also going to make a move draws the double nice pass there in the Slam by Kid Lynn Kidd down the lane thats how valuable Justin mutt is for Virginia Tech he draws the double team from Peyton Shedrick and then kid with a terrific cut when he saw Cedrics head was turned to go to the ball Franklin not waiting cant hit that one you tour with the rebound he averages about four game its an important possession for Virginia Tech get a score here settle in a little bit and whether that initial storm and theyre down 102 Applause big question for the Hokies will he shoot the threepointer better its such a big part of their attack theyre only at 34 percent for the year having Couture back will certainly help hes going to drive it try to swing it and its knocked out of play by Virginia a really good shot fake by Hunter Couture comes and reaches and that opens up a great cut to the basket from Lynn Kidd just a really smart cut by Kid and those are the kind of shots that he can finish over and over again last two games 12 points a game five and a half rebounds 11 of 13 from the field yeah its only 85 shooting and thats going to be a violation could not get a shot up in time Virginia has forced 12 of those this season if any place in the country cheer more for shot clock violations than John Paul Jones Arena thats the truth and by the way how nice of the University of Virginia to name a building after the face player of Led Zeppelin and John Paul Jones there is one of my favorite places to do in the game its awesome I mean one of the best new Arenas in the country Applause Clark had it knocked away got it back scoops and hits the mistake there was trying to reach you got to keep your body in front of TJ Clark no Cavaliers dominating in the paint 142 outscoring the Hokies Applause kid wants the ball trying to go inside close Scots Olympic Head oneonone in the post against Kaden Shedrick nobody came over to double and oneonone in the post I think is one of the most difficult if not the most difficult thing to guard in these games and Mike young says the kids probably the most improved player on his roster yeah I think thats right I mean hes been really good he sticks to his role sparkling with some help Beekman shot clock down to six Beekman swings from McNeely into three he cant hits nearly such a good looking shooter every time he shoots it you think its going to go in a watch for a low cross screen here there it is the touch back out for mutts twoman game there and batted away and another turnover and the pressure is really bothering Virginia Tech their passes are not crisp as a result of it long run coming and it wont drop for done so one and done there remember about the Hokies now last year they started out very slowly they were two and seven in ACC play then they caught fire they took that into the ACC tournament they were a world win in Brooklyn and the ACC Tournament winning the whole thing Collins from the corner no and not many teams were playing better than Virginia Tech at the close of the year I mean Couture was the MVP of the ACC tournament at 31 points in the final against Duke then they wound up getting beat in the tournament by Texas I believe it was but what a great year for Mike Young and the Hokies last year they were incredible once they got to New York City and the ACC tournament McNeely for Clark shot clock a factor trying to get inside and Padula will knock it away thats with three oclock and weve got a timeout with 10 28 to go here in the first half Virginia sharp early leading 19 to 12 Moses Moody Ty Jerome and Steph Curry in the house Michael Vick is here as well Michael Vick is in the crowd back there as well and also the ACC commissioner Jim Phillips is here he was at Clemson Wake Forest last night set it to North Carolina Duke to see the women play and then Carolina NC State the men on Saturday yeah Ty Jerome was a vital part of that 2019 National Championship team along with Kyle guy and DeAndre Hunter hes going to beat this clock gonna be an offensive foul however Gardner going in strong but commits the charge so no basket Music late clocks they had to get it quickly and Sean Padula just steps in and able to draw the charge talking about those celebrities Steph Curry had a shoulder injury really affected his golf game and be able to be able to play as often as hed like at Cal Club out in San Francisco thats a shame with the shot shot for Doula knocks the Dead comes and averaging 17 have you played Cal Club have not its a great place but you have to wear long pants there a bunch of aristocrats and in your case very long pants with empty Pockets I minor rather short hes really looking to make a move Ponder plow way downtown Kihei Clark his defense on Sean Petula has been so good look how far out Virginia Tech has to start its awesome with the hard hedge off the ball screen action Vasily trying to force his way into the lane and draws a foul in the paints and theyre howling here inside John Paul Jones Arena but foul goes against Virginia have to take the ball in there like a running back and fazily had that thing cupped to make sure that nobody could knock it away Franklin with the personal Applause and a half to go here the first half Music Virginia getting some pretty good minutes off the bench here in the early going Applause and off for Couture no three there they dump downstairs bazilly will make it go all set up in order to get the ball back inside its just a great mall ball movement and the angle to throw it inside to bezilla who got really good position down low foreign Applause ER action theres another shot faking you have to stay down on those fakes opens up the lane anytime you leave leave the floor on a fake number two on bazilly hes gonna come out right here and kid will quickly get back in the game he had just hit the bench a minute ago Applause really the issue for this Virginia Tech defense is how many contested shots can they force I mean early on Virginia was getting to the Lane and getting to the rim at will before that last time out 14 of their points were in the lane Virginia just one for eight from threepoint territory and that ones going to be knocked in out of the corner by Maddox whos been struggling from threepoint distance is 30 percent but he drills that one to tie the game and Virginia in one of those droughts and from time to time they have suffered through these Virginia is not a great scoring team they could score but they really set themselves apart with defense founder plus with a missed there and tied at 19 so the Hokies surging after Chile starts with an opportunity to grab the lead here kid up high Applause must has been pretty quiet to this point Maddox with the fake and hits it a twopointer Darius Maddox can shoot it off the catch hes really improved his midrange game hit some big threes late against NC State he had 16 points four of six from three in that game Applause thatll go on Padula 7 47 to go here in the first half Darius Maddox A Gifted scorer coming off the handoff action little fake and gets a contested shot to go he has stopped turning it over meanwhile Virginia in a scoring drought which has been a regular problem for him a lot of it Dave I think has been shot selection over the last several possessions I think Virginia has settled for threepoint shots theyre one of nine from three and those nine threes make up half of the Virginia shot attempts and early on in the game they were getting to the Lane getting to the rim putting Virginia Tech in rotation and getting just about whatever they wanted but Virginia Tech has tightened up defensively Applause so the Cavaliers hope for their last five trying to snap that Gardner will do exactly that with a feathery touch oh Caden Gardner is an excellent scorer for his last two games hes had six points combined and a grand total of 33 minutes played they got tangled up and hit the deck should be a really fun matchup of the point guards tonight Maddox will step back try to drill it but well short and Virginia comes away with it Clark credit for that because he stayed right in front of Sean Padula as he was trying to get into the lane Gardner going to town in the lane nice sweet shot there starting to pick up the pace offensively uh he made that just with that initial shot fake got Lynn Kidd off balance and then took advantage of him with that spin into the lane Applause butts dropping that shoulder kicks it good ball movement heres Padula yes allnette and a triple when the ball moves like that Virginia Tech is going to get Rhythm jumpers and Sean Padula doesnt find many openings because hes got to bring the ball up he cant be a two guard hes got a hes gotta handle it and then get off Ball action Virginia coming off a win over Florida State theyve lost to the number one team in the land Houston previously but when they lose they tend to be very very close I think the three losses they have are by a combined 13 points much is a dangerous passer here hes going to score this tried two and a miss in close our he has four assists in this game when hes operating in the post he can find people one of the most respected players in the league hes quite a young man too hes come up with what three degrees already hes got two masters already on the drive and the block from behind out of the sky by Maddox and what a great recovery by Darius Maddox to block that out of the hands of Reese beefman mutts lets fly but no doesnt take many threepointers but he tends to hit what he takes his 10 for 23 now hes got to be aggressive offensively 100 plus outside now inside Franklin working hard got it hes been tough to handle on that Baseline here in the first half so important Dave weve talked about it but to stay on the floor is a Defender now watch Hunter Couture here just that little little Shake move along the Baseline got Couture off the floor and once you leave the floor first as a Defender youre done Franklin last time out put a 20 against FSU he had four threepointers in that game and this one hes Mr inside so its Virginia on top 2624 Matic straight on yes quite no hesitation coming off that little pin down just curled it right to the freethrow line and up hes got a little hitch in that shot Maddox is a very gifted scorer seven points tonight Applause back screen by Franklin Applause Park deep in the corner back up top for Franklin shot clock at six Honda plus yes got a great look absolutely buried it and he adds a different dimension when he sets a ball screen he can ghost out of it but even if he sets it he can pick and pop well he is an emerging factor for Tony Bennett here at this point in the season mutts on the attack turns and fires is an elbow all over him 2926 and another quick strike and right down the lane its key hey Clark I dont know whether Sean Padula thought he had Defenders behind him but he just opened up his hips and opened the door for that middle drive by Kihei Clark Sean Padula here hes just wide open all of a sudden his hips are open and key here Clark is gone is that its 14 years that Tony Bennett has been at the helm here at the University of Virginia just past the great Terry Holland and as the alltime wins leader here at Virginia there has never been a finer gentleman in basketball than Terry Hall these two head coaches big admirers of the other the programs as well OT in the game Couture straight on for a threepointer Hunter Couture holding that arm he is he must have taken a bump on it he just shed his Defender you know off that little pin down and then curled at the top of the line he does not need much time to get a shot off its really pretty to watch hes been staying away from banging up that elbow while hes been in recovery the last month clocked down the lane and blocked away anytime Kihei Clark drives you have to make him finish because if you bring a another Defender over and Couture going out and you see hes kind of dragging that left arm as he came off the screen Im not sure whether it happened a little bit earlier but didnt look like anything was bothering him getting into that shot just great shot preparation with his feet to square up and all ten toes pointed at The Rim thats darn near perfect Mike young told him yeah youve stayed away from it and practiced getting hurt again that one drilled from way downtown by Beekman and Mike promised him it would happen in the game he would take a knock and apparently he has how much is Reese Speakman improved from last year to this as a shoot hes shooting near 50 from three on the season mutts needing room to operate in that paint no Franklin with a rebound those are opportunities Virginia Tech has to keep trying to exploit because hes such a good passer in there all right lets see bounce feed speaking to a good Passover Applause leading the ACC and assists when you talk about Kihei Clark how long hes been around number two alltime at Virginia category behind John Friday Speakman back up top for Clark Virginia Tech giving up the lane so tough to guard the ball period but too easy to get into Lane what a pass and an easy two for Franklin and give all the credit to Clark draws the defense and then finds Franklin for the easy dunk but Doula has to turn his back every time down and Clark just takes away his vision that time took that shot away at least a clean look at it Couture has gone right to the scores table had a collision thats going to be a blocking foul a good sign there for the Hokies is that Couture is ready to come back in that Virginia Tech has been operating most of this first half without Grant pizzilli in the game picked up his second fouls only played six and a half minutes in the game Mike young trying to get to the second half with pizzelle only with two and Virginia will take a timeout hell take the break as well 126 to go in the first half 3629 the Cavaliers time theyve won eight of their last nine games Music so under 90 seconds before the break here at Virginia Applause Flex action the screen along the Baseline and a down screen on the lane line Applause done slamming on the brakes and traveling thats just their second turnover Applause one minutes ago before the half kid for Padula downstairs they can operate in the post a lot of contact on that shot and the whistle so Virginia with a chance to open it up a little bit more here before halftime mark on the penetration its so difficult to guard Ben Von der plaster set a little ball screen and then popped out right in front of Mike young that opened up the lane for Kihei Clark Virginia with their largest lead of the first half Justin mutts bringing the ball up give Sean Patel a little bit of break hes got to go right into founder plus hes got a hard hedge like that hes got to go right into his hip pick up a foul Lokis will keep it here with 17 seconds on the clock 12 on the shot clock to put it into mutts good cut by Couture beautiful thats just beautiful basketball what a great read thought he was going to come off the screen just went the other way and flipped it into the basket in the final seconds my goodness now thats the way to end the half wow talk about an exclamation point Ty Jerome Steph Curry whered he get a hat like that Dave youll look really good in that one after the game where a hat like that get a free bowl of soup wow three speakmen coming off again ball screen action and Virginia really close strong near those last four or five minutes well its been a game of runs Virginia got off to a great start got out to a sizable lead and then Virginia Tech kind of settled in but to start the second half Grant bazilli back on the floor for Virginia Tech that can help uh stretch the floor with this shooting ability jumper coming from Maddox but that wont drop pretty good look there right out of the gate to begin the second half and no second shots at all for Virginia Tech great blackout by Jayden Gardner to keep Justin mutts off the offensive glass no shock here Cavaliers with just two turnovers in the first 20 minutes you must have like stick them on their fingers downstairs to dribble down for Gardner nice soft touch there for two really good in the post also an excellent midrange game and I think Tony Bennett has to be very pleased that Jaden Gardners having a good game in this one last two games hes been very quiet on the offensive end in East Carolina he was an excellent score yeah he scored about 2 000 points in his career theres mutts out of the post you double team when he finds open People Brazilian no usually Dave its an automatic when the ball goes into the post that Virginias going to bring a double but because mutts is such a great passer hes got six assists in this game Clark just lost the handle on that one heres mutts to swing it Maddox on the dribble theres hard Hedges on Fall screen so difficult to deal with Beekman reached in they committed the foul thatll be his first tonight when I say hard head whenever theres a ball screen set the screeners defender just jumps out and hedges that ball screen and forces the ball screen ball handler to change his path and its really disruptive the Hokies a team in dire need of a win with a fivegame losing see and theyre facing a gauntlet of a schedule with games at Virginia here at Clemson Saturday followed by a home game against Duke on Monday shot clock down to seven and the paint just lost it and out it goes really nice job by Ben bonder uh Ben fonderplast to just wall up and force bazilly to try to take a shot over him because only just lost the ball because of all the contact Applause 10 in this pole they got US Highway number two back in early December and a rare turnover and a couple of those to begin the second half it could have been an easy basket but Virginia is just able to get into the lane and force Virginia Tech into rotation and knocks down a triple hes in a good rhythm in this game man is he huge in the ACC tournament he hit a couple of gamewinning threes and the ACC tournament as the Hokies played their way to an NCAA ticket so I knew the catch shoots and its In and Out Boy that was in the cylinder 26 to go here Kihei Clark leading the way for the Cavaliers Sean Padilla right now its almost like hes shaking his head saying what do I have to do to get rid of Kihei Clark even though hes sort of sideways on the body contact theres no call he is with you every step youre taking on the floor he is certainly 20 games for that National Championship team heres Virginia I think he started on the 1984 final four team as well with Jimmy Miller yeah it feels that way but around forever to tour back in the lineup tonight mutts Lane opened up for him and he lays it in a really good quick drive with the left hand by Justin mutts a little bit too much attention on Hunter Couture gave him a lane with his first buckets Gardner looking to return the favor takes the hit hell be at the line to shoot two the tour just a little back dribble and got Jaden Gardner out of position couldnt stay in front of Justin mutts nobody came over from the weak side Applause so two at the line and coming up a lot of college basketball beginning noon Miami and Duke Texas A M and Kentucky on Saturday Miami Duke should be a Dandy as well Miami coming off a nice victory over Syracuse by four Donna Coral Gables and Kentucky coming off its best half of the year in the second half against George and Oscar schibe had what do you have 37 points 24 rebounds as the ridiculous performance by the national player of the year going against Buzz Williams former Virginia Tech coach Applause Brazilian with a catch and fire and a triple and thats where hes dangerous you hard hedge when he sets a ball screen and hes going to pop out and that was a good quick decision by Grand facili Applause okies now seven out of 13 from three Applause Beekman beating Franklin yes or what a great cut by Franklin just a stop cut looks like he was going to go all the way to basket when he started and then just popped back out off the screen for that wide open shot Franklin with 15 building a really nice night Applause medulla down the paint and well lay it in he scored in double figures in every game so far this season 4641 Applause Rhonda plus again but this time off the back of the iron the rebound by months but Virginia only sends really two guys to the offensive class Jaden Gardner and vanderplas and vanderplas usually on the perimeter but theyre more interested in taking away your transition than they arent getting second shots curling around and drills a three hes starting to get it going Virginia Tech is resilient a lot of teams youd start off one in five and Couture has been out I mean theyre 111 with Couture healthy a lot of teams would hang their heads but Mike young is keeping them in it Applause Music so well jump shot from close range knocked down by Gardners were going to be a factor in this one early in a second and Justin mutts to stand with the ball too long so he Hedges out and stayed with the ball for a couple of throwballs and thats leaving Gardner wide open thats too long thats a foul Gardener with a personal before the shot only number two and Gardner suddenly has nine points twopoint game here catch a fire beyond the threepoint line yeah Darius Maddox drops one and then yeah hard hedge against Virginia Tech when Grandpa zillia is setting that ball screen and he can pop back out usually big guys roll to the basket he got to throw it into a crowd but bazilly can just pop to that threepoint line and hes very effective and the Hokies three of five from threepoint range in this second half now within two possessions with the key for Virginia Tech not just being efficient on the offensive end making sure they dont turn it over get a shot every time down they got to keep Virginia out of the lane now the hook is just desperate to taste another Victory its been so so long with this fivegame skid shot clock is at five Couture cant hit that one had to rush it with Armon Franklin guarding him his little step back just a difficult shot for Hunter Couture his greatest shooter as he is even when the great ones have to rush him theyre going to miss him Applause Beekman using his screen there shot clock now down to 10 and thatll for the feathery touch go down otter plus with a nice touch or shoot that three and hell make it well its really the same action we were just talking about with mazzilli Justin mutt stays on the ball a little bit too long and Commander plauskas Pops to that open area are you used to guarding screen roll most of the time and if it is a pick and pop most times its not Shooters as proficient as Ben bonder Plus or Grant bazilly not Ohio he hit 230 of them those threepointers I want Franklin just grabbed Hunter Couture coming off that screen tough shot heavy traffic brazily cant get it to go its hard for Couture to make a cut if hes going to get grabbed Beekman trying to get past Padula off the iron the follow wont go by Beekman how quick was he on that second jump to get up for that near stick back sure was hes an NBA player theres no doubt in my mind but we look thought about that McNeely will hold him up and foul him and thatll be his first in Virginia obviously very very good in this building here 81 at John Paul Jones Arena last 11 years nobody in the ACC has won more home games than Virginia they have one more win over that span to Duke has at Cameron Indoor Applause Couture the Doula launches yes sir but he doesnt need much space either and I like it when Sean Padula plays at times off the ball where he can be a scorer instead of having to worry about facilitating then scoring youve done such a good job with the basketball Beekman short rebound comes right to Maddox for the Hokies theyre looking for a momentum switch here Alex will pull up hop cant drain it brazili spins around yes a really good job using his body by Grandpa zilli to get that offensive rebound tough shot by Darius Maddox but he was there to clean it up give him nine 5149 a difficult drive held up McNeely with 12 minutes to go in this contest Grandpa zilli founder place trying to block him out but the zilly doesnt surrender to that blackout gets an easy stick back as a result of the offensive rebound and that has not been the case for most of the game for Virginia Tech its been one and out so itll be two for Isaac McNeely the freshman hes had some nice moments Off the Bench for Tony Benny at 12 points against Syracuse 11 against North Carolina need to be Maddox with the foul Applause now coming up Saturday in ABC and the ESPN app a massive Pac12 matinee matchup UCLA leading to conference at 70 13 in a row for them they take on number 11 Arizona 153 coverage begins at two Eastern 11 AM Pacific guess where Jay billis is off to little sun and a ton of fun indoors at McHale and youre going to get to see really one of the underrated teams in the country and UCLA was really wide open got a great look but not bury it boy everybody thought the entire Virginia Defense thought that was going to be a ball reversal ey got lonely he was so wide open on that shot mcgilly good threepoint threat but hell drive it and itll get out for him one of the few twopoint baskets that Isaac McNeely makes hes more of a threepoint shooter but he had a drive in there makes him more dangerous Four Points Off the Bench for the rookie Alex with the kick and its tipped out by Virginia and weve got a timeout with 1109 to go Applause Isaac McNeely the West Virginia player of the year just hesitates finds an open Lane to the basket and a nice finish by the sharp shooting guard Virginia banana in the house as well a lot of colorful outfits tonight some great hats a lot of heavyweight celebrities Music a lot of vegetables I Im very very comforted by that somehow well they value a good balanced diet all the food groups represented here at John Paul Jones Arena smart kids here at Virginia facility lets fly again got a good look rebound tipped out High to Couture its only the second offensive rebound of the game for Virginia Tech medulla almost got the shot to go as he draws the foul with 10 57 to play foul before the shot on McNeely thatll be number two on him Applause so the Hokies to put it in from the Baseline trailing by six Applause months hes been pretty quiet offensively except for his pass and hes got like seven assists I think his Corner jumper rebound Tipton this time Clark comes away wants to run with it hard drive and draws the foul and hes stopping that way Kihei Clark will be at the line not a lot of time to process information on the break but the last thing you want to do is foul Kihei Clark there make him make a shot at The Rim ball bounces along that started the Virginia break and Padula just goes right across his arms just make him make the tough shot medullas third by the way EA 72 percent at the line named to the Bob Cousy award watch list which goes to the nations best point guard at the college level you can guarantee the Kihei Clark and respeakman will take up two spots on the alldefensive team in the ACC the question is who are the other three you have to think leaky black in North Carolina is going to have a spot even though I couldnt believe leaky black didnt make the alldefensive team last year incredible Applause entry pass for mutts on the span yes very much would have been wide open but he got cracked yeah thats what he said on that cut was kind of pleading Clark with a spin move he hay it opens up again oh beautiful job to use the window just kissed it off the glass and did it with the left hand both he and Reese Speakman in practice yesterday were working on those creative finishes around the basket tied up a bit but got it Freedom much for two a good pass and what a terrific catch and finish by Justin mutts that was a tough ball to catch and he got it right up on the rim immediately theyre really congested in there done with a catch and a shot no rebound comes right to the Hokies thats a shot that Ryan Dunn can make but Im not sure that was the exact time for it Virginia Tech needs a bucket here tap back out now right back in for mutts tapped again and a foul from behind and theyll get done for that personal DA Clark using that little elbow ball screen the hesitation move gets it all the way to the rim and about as high off the window as you can get and this is a big time catch after done deflected it Applause off now for Tony Bennett mutts reversing field for the first tour was coming off for a handoff and that was a great read of the defense more worried about Couture coming off of the three and must just turned the corner reading his Defender getting on the outside of his shoulder he was gone came in averaging 148 started to pick up the scoring a little bit after a cold start but as Jim mentioned hes been filing up the assists he has seven Applause Wonder place outside hell launch it and whats with a rebound or Justin mutts talk about a respected player in this league and I think hes going to play in the NBA because he can guard multiple positions such a good passer hes a connector out there looking to make his third consecutive trip to the NCAA tournament he says I want to win a game in the NCAA tournament I havent done that yet pounding his way inside that wont drop and a whistle and a foul and hell commit that one a little frustration perhaps number three well that was a shot that Vasily thinks he should have made I think so too but you give vonder Plus Credit he just made him make the shot over the top of him so now the big guy has to leave well see how long he sits here with just a little over eight minutes to play and three personals yeah I dont think itll be very long I mean Mike Young Smart to take him out before the next media timeout so he doesnt pick a quick one up Applause Clark sizes up a long one and thats going to stay on this end it was tipped off from mutts and out of play off the Hokies under Ray here 7 56 to go a little handoff action outside the elbow and Gardner switches off not a great communication possession for Virginia and Justin mutts takes it all the way to the rim for the easy finish eats Jay in the first half the not so much here in the second half no I think the Virginia Tech defense done a better job of protecting the paint and making Virginia prove it over the top but how about Virginia Tech I mean theyre shooting 52 percent in this game theyre nine of 19 from three and still theyre down four points they havent been able to find their way to the free throw line only two of two in Virginia eight of nine from the foul line so under eight minutes to go here at John Paul Jones Arena in front of the packed house and a big time rivalry game in the conference Clark with a shot clock to five hell settle for the three and just absolutely bottom it out so worried about his Drive Sean Padula gives him a little bit of extra space and that space was just enough for Clark to get up that three and knock it down he is 15 Virginia had missed their last four threes loose and scooped up by Beekman and here he comes on Couture swung to Gardner and made the shot hell be gone to the line off the turnover Virginia able to get out in transition and Reese Speakman has been outstanding on Hunter Couture every time Couture comes off for a handoff Beekman blows it up able to get a deflection on that pass to Justin mutz picks it up and all of a sudden Virginia has an advantage situation Applause Gardner to the line for threepoint play guy who is heroicing defeat last season when these two teams last met in Blacksburg he had 17 points and 15 rebounds a 10point lead for Virginia in a low possession game might be might as well be 16 in another type of game Virginia making their foul shots nine out of 10 Purdue looking for an answer no rebound tipped down controlled by the Hokies right back up and in for two Collins Ill give Lynn kid credit there couldnt grab it but kept it alive able to tap it back one of the few offensive rebound opportunities that Virginia Tech has had in this game yes that kid is a big time shooter the last three games hes been a factor for Tony Bennett the dula hasnt knocked away and it will be hokeys basketball here with 6 24 to go Padula cannot shake Kihei Clark got past him Clark still able to knock that ball away probably got a fair amount of arm there but it doesnt matter didnt get called he is such a good Defender mutts and no basket there fouled before that with Virginia leading by 11 That Elbow action with Justin mutts at the left elbow is really effective so worried about the cutter coming across him he can keep it in turns and theres no weak side defense there to pick him up foul on Gardner now he comes he has three this is the biggest lead for Virginia tonight medulla trying to cut into his shorts and one and done those long shots equal a long rebounds Kihei Clark Switched Off onto Justin mutts he had the advantage on the glass for that long rebound didnt do any good Clark looking to penetrate no that one might have brought the house down with a little under six to go Applause but hes only crosscourt in the corner follow away Maddox and no shots suddenly not dropping here for the Hokies they didnt need to fall away hes going against Kihei Clark there just turn and go over him they really sense of the Cavaliers are trying to put the hammer down still a lot of time left but then again youre talking about Virginia Applause straight on no high rebound chase down and its going to stay on this end thats going to be off Maddox in the end and itll be Virginia ball great Hustle by Maddox thought he got grabbed and he was going for the ball but really good hustle Hunter Couture back on he had missed four games they lost every one of those games the Hokies did able to start tonight there was a moment where he had to leave the contest because that elbow which he injured you know about a month ago was starting to have act up again he wasnt away very long Clark with a fake oh he really has that move down rebounds cant be tipped in he has one of the best shot fakes in college basketball surely does medulla got caught underneath Brazilian yes got a good look and thats a big three one they really needed Virginia Tech has now made 10 or more threes for the 10th time in the last 54 games Music big one there 68 some shots with Steph Curry selfies that was really annoying all the Selfies that the baseball team wanted to take with you that would be zero to slows the game down step by the way 3264 threes in his career made 147 the current year Virginia with 122 just for perspective very popular here courtside entry pass knocks around a bit away heres Clark open yes just a beautiful pass by Ben bonderplas so it looked like Justin mutts had the Steal and then founder plus with just a really heady pass to Kihei Clark back up by 11 you cant cut into that the question for Virginia Tech down 11 here Virginia with the balls how do you get stops I mean youre not going to win this game on the road without getting stops right now with just under four minutes to go in regulation not a very good chance that Virginia is going to turn it over a big man and one big big drive there and hell be at the line for his acceleration off that thrive it initially didnt look like a quick drive but then he accelerated right there and just got past Maddox to get to the basket with that left hand another great play by Reece Beekman on both ends hes been out student and by the way chicken tenders earlier if Virginia scores over 67 points there are chicken tenders for everybody so big nice here at John Paul joins the arena now heres a trivia question for you Dave OBrien do you know what a wahoo is I I dont exactly know what Oahu is what is a what is a wahoo or a who Ive been told a wahoo is a fish that drinks over twice its weight which would have accurately described me in college and that would have made Phil rapri a wahoo Hall of Fame Wahoo Applause 7460 largest lead tonight for the Cavaliers I wonder if Kihei Clark is going to follow Sean Padula to the bus after the game hes been with him every dribble and hes been in his shirt that ones swished in a little bit of an answer there by MJ Collins hes a good guard rebounder in addition to being able to score at eight points and eight rebounds in that win against North Carolina hes going to be a really good player got a switch now mutts on Clark and Padula now on Bounder plus hes trying to post him up shot clock to six black took a peek drives and kicks done will fire no and Couture the rebound Virginias really won just about every battle theyve won the paint theyve won the glass theyre winning the freethrow line and theyve certainly won the few opportunities in transition Virginia Tech has nothing in transition in this game boy mutts did everything he wanted to do there except make the shot that just put so much pressure on your defense Applause Freeport New York Franklin over the shoulder to pass Dunn gives it up they continue to move it but maybe one pass too many heres Padula for Couture and a triple got that most breaks you have guys running the lanes trying to get to the rim or the Deep corner but hunter Couture runs right to the threepoint line thats his equivalent of a layup God that guy can really shoot it theres 11 in his return to the lineup tonight so the hokeys not out of this thing yet under two minutes though downstairs for two easy ones another time where Justin mutts hard Hedges out top and then hes got to recover 25 feet to get to Roundup back up to 10 batted around its been a tough tough night for Sean padulla well just great defense by Kihei Clark to stay in front then Ryan Dunn came over and got that deflection in the turnover those long arms that seven foot wingspan and Sean Padula had nowhere to throw the ball Clark just able to stay in front and then the deflection coming over from the weak Side by Ryan Dunn Thats Just excellent team defense by Virginia so Clark to the line Virginia with five players in double figures have gotten really good balance and theyre back on top by 11 Olivia miles in the number seven Fighting Irish women play next Thursday night weve got NC State and Louisville coming up Sunday at one oclock thats 20 points now for Kihei Clark and thats a season high for him the Taurus step back three too strong of the Hokies and time running out on them with a minute 21 showing it has been a really difficult start to this AC season for Virginia Tech but one guy that is not giving up is Mike Young he knows that this team has the ability to get back to that 111 version that early on in the season you know beat North Carolina beat Penn State beat Oklahoma State theyre better than their record timeout Virginia here more six times in the last three years but in a minute 21 to get there tonight theyve been so effective off the dribble able to get into the lane draw help and then play out of it but oftentimes on drives that especially in the first half PA Clark able to get all the way to the basket Reese Speakman a couple times this has to be the best offensive performance of the year for Virginia at least the most efficient Applause with the kick in the lane Franklin who is a real factor in the first half will drive it again very difficult angle there couldnt get it to go were under a minute to play and Virginia on their way to their 14th win of the season and about to be six and two inside the conference knocked around into the corner medulla shot too strong another one batted out of the back court heres Padula lays that one off for mutton to it 29 seconds to go into timeout but a 10point game 10 point lead here for the Cavaliers Applause Music 7868 Virginia on their way to a win here
