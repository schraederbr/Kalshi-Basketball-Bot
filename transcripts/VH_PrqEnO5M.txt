bottom of a competitive ma but theres some Talent on this Manhattan roster youll see it tonight officials are Lee celle Tim clockery and Claire Aubrey in Virginia with a little Wrinkle in its starting lineup today DayDay Ames and Andrew roie two ball handlers on the floor TJ power will come off the bench now Virginia wants to make sure that they throw the ball to the guys in the white shirts turnovers have been a problem in the early season Elijah Saunders shot clock at four theyre comfortable laid in the shot clock and it is Roy with the first basket of the game thats a really important play for Virginia theyve they do a nice job coming off those High screens but they really dont have anybody who can get the ball into the lane to the basket and that little floater thats a big big shot for Virginia early Manhattan last time out coming off a buzzer beating win against Army theyre looking for the guy to get going Shaquil Bender he cant hit and thats been an early season story for the Jaspers you see the rest of the Virginia starting five mcne their leading score ases is the transfer from Kansas State Blake youan in the big sophomore from postcard pretty cordelane Idaho and there he is with the pretty touch and again the both possessions by Virginia late in the shot clock theyve been able to get the ball in the lane and create something starting lineups for Manhattan will sidnor number nine in green itll be hard to take your eyes off of him hes been their best player early front runner for freshman of the year in the conference Baseline Drive thats Messiah Gillard who scored in double figures and three straight well hes hes a guy who comes in really good size a Junior College transfer 63 195 lbs and thats one thing this is a Manhattan team that has pretty good size a little bit shorter than Virginia but not necessarily less Applause Music Applause bulky Ames puts it on the floor and were going to get a foul against Applause Virginia first on Ames Ron Sanchez former head coach at Charlotte elevated after Tony Bennett retired he was a longtime Bennett assistant at Virginia before leaving for Charlotte and came back to be an assistant last year no good from Wesley Robinson who had the gamewinning shot and that one against Applause Army Manhattans a team that has pretty good Applause Shooters something to watch theyre not going to come out and press Buchanan Ames Catch and Release good and all three possessions where Virginias scored its been vintage Virginia basketball milking the shot clock and being efficient late in the shot clock and thats the key thing yeah you can milk the shot clock all you want but eventually you got a score a turnover by Manhattan their head coach John Gallagher told us for his team to win tonight they have to have fewer than 10 turnovers he actually told us it was 10 10 10 after have fewer than 10 turnovers they got to make at least 10 threes theres a three and thats exactly the kind of three that at which he excels coming off that screen pulling up and knocking it down but for Manhattan its fewer than 10 turnovers more than 10 offensive rebounds 10 threes theyre hoping for a big game from Shaquil Bender one in green their leading score last year off to a slow start Winston their point guard kicks it out Gillard not close McNeely snags the Applause caram roie backing down Gillard first Miss for Virginia they had made their first four Winston looking to push stripped on the way up it stays with the Jaspers now Ro had an opportunity there in transition and he sort of fumbled the ball a little bit and sometimes when youre playing in transition and you take an early shot and you miss it that gives your opponent a chance to get out and go and this is a Manhattan team that plays very well in transition in the passing Lane Buchanan Robinson knocks it down from the outside Wesley Robinson a senior who was a division 2 transfer from Bloomfield College in New Jersey you may notice hes wearing a little strap some straps on his right shoulder they didnt know whether hed be able to go full speed tonight or not Buchanan in the high post his second basket and thats the strategy theyre going to play off of Buchanan but I think I think its fine if youre playing off of him if hes H the free throw line but when hes standing there on that logo I think that he can make that shot if you dont pressure yeah Buchanan last year played in every game as a true freshman former top 100 recruit sidor with those long arms could not get get the tap Applause in this is a pretty good start for Virginia particularly after getting their ears boxed in uh the Bahamas in there if youre going to play him to shoot the three hes hes not really quick but he can drive the ball to the basket five early for mcney Robinson another triple good so he hits the game winner at the buzzer against Army and hes knocked down two threes early here in Applause Charlottesville and he came in on the season having only made three threepoint baskets had only taken Applause seven Gillard to defending mcne it comes down low your Cannons got a size advantage over Robinson too easy and Buchanan those are shots that he is going to have to make when Virginia goes inside like that sometimes he has struggled to make those types of shots but an easy job there Bender off the shot fck and Dan weve seen this a guy who can score whos in a shooting slump you go to the basket you get an easy one then things open up well youve got to be careful with that guy he I mean if he starts making him then you have to get up on him but with the way he shot the ball so far I think you dont want to get out on him so quickly Ames off the hesitation Buchanans got six shot clock at six eight points for Buchanan and a chance for one more at the Applause strike that was a good tough play by buan he had a lot of guys around him Virginia sizzling eight of nine from the field found ways to win during that 2019 run diakite had the huge shot how they beat Auburn how they beat Texas Tech that was a very exciting team and you know the funny thing is Ive often thought that Tony Bennetts best team may have been his 2016 team that lost Syracuse uh in the Elite 8 and but that was a great team they put guys in the NBA Kyle guy is sitting over there on the Virginia bench as an assistant coach now those three free throws he made in that setting are still one of the remarkable things that you see in the NCA basketball tournament a lot of fairy dust sprinkled on that tournament run and now the job for Ron Sanchez the challenge for Sanchez Dan is when Tony Bennett took over this program it was in a different place and Ron Sanchez inherits a program with significantly higher expectations theres no question about that that Championship B thats hanging in here is only one part of it I mean Virginia was one of the best teams in the country throughout the entire Applause 2010s they were winning 25 plus games on the regular ACC titles Elijah Saunders scratch four from San Diego State TJ power into the game The Duke transfer Saunders banging down low gets the double power for three thats a good sign for Virginia he had been struggling with his shot five of 20 from the field four of 16 from three prior to that make and you look at his stat line he doesnt really do very much except shoot the ball so if hes going to help the team the balls got to go in the basket a transfer from duke where he didnt play a whole lot last year they look at the timeline of how things unfolded Virginia lost to Colorado Auto state in the first four game fall break mid October shortly after Bennett announces his retirement and then play ball November 6th as Bender misses the three and its knocked out by the Jaspers and right it its here early in the game Manhattan is settling for shots and part of that is the Virginia Defense the Virginia Defense doing a really nice job keeping the ball handlers in front weve seen very few drives to the basket Manhattans really not a screen and roll kind of team they do a lot of cutting and passing and Virginia has handled that very effectively so Music far Virginia a perfect three of three from Beyond The Arc Saunders banging down low grazes The Rim the rebound to Shaquil Bender team second leading score Winston almost lost the handle careless and bender gets tied Applause up we will step aside Cavaliers 9 of 12 from the field and a perfect three of three from Deep they have their largest lead early season gallager was a head coach at Hartford while an assistant there he came to Charlottesville to play Virginia back in 2007 as the fallway goes and he knocked off four major teams at Hartford including Boston College out of the ACC twice this is the end where Manhattan really has to tighten it up Virginia shooting 9 for 12 and they have their talented freshman in the game Jacob coffee Virginia does five in white roie using the window thats really a nice job with that high coming off that high screen en roll roie that time people talk about how the not very quick and hes not but when you come off that screen and roll if you can use your size to get down in the lane and score then thats a big help Bender three not there mcne a 45 threepoint shooter last Applause year a right idea they had great ball movement and power was open but an errant Music pass there is is John Gallagher America East coach of the year at Hartford in 2018 second season at the helm for the Jaspers last year he told us that his best player heart and soul of the team Brett Rumple torn ACL against Yukon the team never recovered rumples going to be out again for the season this year T the same ACL just a few weeks ago but he feels this group is better equipped to handle that theyre of talent he thinks is higher their depth is better lot of dribbling by bender and those are tough shots Bender hes been struggling making open shots and you dont really get back on track by taking tough ones out against this defense kofy for Applause Music two and this is exactly the way that John Gallagher did not want to start the game Virginia out there playing with a tremend tremendous amount of confidence a little Pace now too aims not there Kofi the follow the Freshman from the Seattle area opened his Virginia Career with three straight games where he scored in double figures Roxboro the Australian to Elijah Curry from the outside Curry and thats just a nice job by Manhattan pushing the ball up to court quickly even though Virginia made the basket Manhattans got to get easier shot opportunities and one way to do it is to push the ball up the court thats a Applause travel we talked about the fact that Virginia is shooting a very high percentage and when you take good shots you you shoot a very high percentage thats just a simple screen and roll Manhattan did not handle that very well Virginia 12 out of 16 from the field they struggled from the field in the two losses in the Bahamas and Robinson stepped out of bounds and Dan that two game skid in Nassau it took you back to last year where even though Virginia was third in the ACC and won 20 plus games they were blown out an awful lot they were blown out twice in the Bahamas well and thats what everybody remembers but again Virginia they won 23 games last year they finished third in the ACC they got invited to the NCA tournament you know there was a time here in charlott field where they had a parade for that team but of course those days are long gone that Bennett guy had something to do with that well there are some pretty good players that helped Applause it power too strong rebound Gillard Winston pushing look at this turns it over he got going a little too fast but thats tremendous quickness right there and thats what Manhattan needs to do they theyve got to take care of the basketball but when Virginia misses is something Virginia hadnt done a lot of Manhattans got to push the ball Day Day AMS the other thing youre seeing Virginia do here today is theyve sort of Switched their offense up its not so much Five Guys on the perimeter theyre getting guys in the post and when you get guys in the post and move the ball coming out of the post those are the kind of plays you get easy bucket for Kofi and Virginia shooting better than 70 from the field in this first Applause half contested Robinson and we get a foul its going to be on Kofi Jacob Kofi Gatorade Player of the Year in Washington The Freshman with the twohanded flush Music without missing a beat how many programs without missing a beat can lose two guys to the NBA just pick right up where they left off the thing that you have to understand is this is a young Virginia team and its also involve some transfers a new Virginia team and so its going to be hard to replace this we yeah pman beakman was actually a free agent he was not drafted excuse me but he was I mean were talking about the ability to take the ball to the basket that was a big part of Virginias success with beakman at the end of the shot clock he get the ball into the Lan you know Kei Clark could do the same thing and so you recalibrate this offense and now they were counting on Jaylen warley a transfer from Florida State who was thought to be their point guard but Tony Bennett steps down and warley hits the portal well welcome to college basketball in 2025 Buchanan almost cracked double digits in the first half but the good news is that Buchanan caught that ball and up through contact and Drew the foul the bad news is that hes going to the free throw line a career 49 free throw shooter seven of 15 on the young season the reverse Jinx didnt even work there Dan heres this weeks featured mens basketball game right here on acc Network and the app on Friday Seattle visiting number 11 Duke a chance to watch The Freshman Phenom Cooper flag coverage begins at 700 pm Eastern well one of the problems for Virginia last year was that they ranked 355th out of 364 teams in free throw shooting Applause percentage the last foul on Saunders third team foul on Virginia theres Devin dinkin George Mason transfer gillards three back iron offensive rebound Curry see thats a long shot Virginia cut off the dribble penetration early and they forced a really long threepoint shot and thats a contested three goes in the basket but if thats the kind of shot Manhattans going to get their long night is going to continue here at dinkin zero in green hes another point guard for Manhattan Off the Bench play starter Applause minutes McNeely lobs to BU Canon and they get curry with his second foul thats a nice job by McNeely to look for that pass you Canon at 6 11 and unlike the games against Tennessee and St Johns the inside guys for Manhattan are not big bulky guys and so Virginia is not at the phys physical disadvantage they were with that as that they were down in the Bahamas yeah in the two games in the Bahamas Virginia was minus 42 in points in the paint tonight an 18 to4 Advantage well theyre doing a nice job getting their guys inside they had a lot of activity early in the shot clock and then as the shot clock runs down they have their big guys with their back to the basket Sid no from the outside this kid has tremendous upside already a couple of 20point games and hes only a freshman well and hes number two on this team in threepoint field goals attempted so you got to get out guard him Ames throws it to the Manhattan bench and Manhattan has now closed this game to a sevenpoint deficit well again this is a team that can put some points on the board and Saunders playing a little bit too far off as I said that that that young man has thats now his 24th threepoint attempt on the year which is second on this team so he likes to get out there and shoot it still early Robinsons pass knocked down by mcney one pass too many right there ases Catch and Release got it and thats again thats a little bit different twist for Virginia pushing the ball up the court and shooting a three in transition you dont often see that sidor no whistle see thats a force you need to move the ball move the defense around and then sner will get opportunities you alluded to it that three by dinkin sometimes that can be Fools Gold you make a shot and its a tough contested shot now you think you can try it again foul on bender his first and this is an excellent response by the Cavaliers you mentioned Manhattan had cut into that lead it was seven points it looked like the Jasper had something going but a couple of tough shots and then Virginia converts Ro got off to a fast start Buchanan with eight in the first half McNeely to the 10 dinkin snatches Applause it thats a good play by Ames to get out there Bender hadnt shot it well but hes an excellent shooter Gillard dkin too much Gillard on cleanup Duty well now Virginia did not secure that defensive rebound but one of the reasons was that was an airball and its they were in perfect position for the rebound but when it didnt hit anything then that allowed Manhattan to get in Applause Music there mcney driving on bender Saunders lets it Fly volleyball and its dinkin thats great Hustle by The Jasper they just Virginia had a number of opportunities to get that ball and they didnt do Music it sidor draws the attention Baseline Drive Gillard with a chance for a threepoint play The Feisty Jaspers fell behind early cutting into this Virginia lead Messiah Gillard with an and one Music here comes the pass its intercepted by Bender 3 seconds left Bender throws it down low Robinson for the win is Applause good that was Friday night Manhattan with a buzzer beater to beat Army but in that game they trailed by nine the Jaspers did late in that second half were able to come back and tonight down 15 at one point in the first half to Virginia a chance to make it a fivepoint game now they cant quite do it but its a twopossession game and if youre John Gallagher on the Manhattan sideline you got to be thinking hey did we just weather the storm because when you look at the stat sheet this game probably shouldnt be close well Virginia shooting over 60 from the field overall theyre shooting 66 from Beyond the threepoint Arc mcne nearly walked Saunders too strong see now Virginia they theyve gotten into driving the ball to the basket kicking it out and missing threes they had success early throwing the ball into the low post and playing out of Music Applause there sidor the three thats a nice block out by roie and that time the difference before when sner made the three he wasnt under any pressure but coffee coffees 6 10 hes got long arms he went out there and made syor think about that Virginia with two field goals in its last 6 minutes plus stolen away by bender and the reverse layup its a fourpoint game with two and 1 half to go in the opening half now that that those turnovers really plagued Virginia down in the Mamas and theyve done a much better job with the turnovers tonight but boy that was two points easy for Manhattan Saunders thats easy and those turnovers 17 turnovers a game in the losses to Tennessee and St Johns and through the early part of the Season Virginias turning it over on 22 of their possessions thats amongst the worst turnover rates in the country you cannot do that when you play fewer possessions but now its Manhattan with a couple of live ball turnovers John Gallagher unhappy and he calls a timeout having some words with Clare Aubrey Music Music well you know when somebody takes a run at you you have to be able to respond and of course the Virginia Cavaliers they have a history of responding defensively this is just a nice job by roie getting himself in between the two Manhattan players and John Gallagher is upset but they could have very easily called a flagrant foul on bender for grabbing Ro on the arm but that Virginia they had success early getting easy shots and among those easy shots were some dunks and in this recent stretch they fallen into settling I think for three point shots but when youre a team that relies on defense you rely on your defense to get you straighten out now does Manhattan have a counter punch in the final 90 seconds lot of dribbling and dkin turns it over and this is the Snowball Effect it really is and man hadnt they cut it to six and youre talking for I guess four and youre talking about okay now these last couple of minutes are going to be really important well the last couple minutes have all been Virginia and its been some careless basketball by the Applause Jaspers Ames using the screen draws the double Kofi thought about it tries it lots of times when you think about it uh you know get it and shoot it hes a pretty good threepoint shooter yeah in the words of Shakespeare delays have dangerous Laughter ends yeah but could Shakespeare make a free throw no 62 I believe Applause Jaden Winston young man who went to damaa Catholic Maryland Powerhouse finding the Australian Frasier Roxboro we talked to Winston he told us he had about five six family members making the trip hes from the DMV that was a big basket for Manhattan fivepoint game and now they get Winston with the foul still have another foul to Applause give well you have another foul to give I dont think you want to be giv him with your point guard in the first half this feels like a big possession for Virginia roie Ames Second Chance Kofi great position down low and that thats thats a great job hes got a smaller guy on him theres nobody really digging down at the basketball dont pass it back out just power it to the goal I really think that was a big basket for Virginia the lead is seven in the waning moments Winston the turnaround no good a season High 38 first half points for Virginia but John Gallaghers Jaspers number two here at jpj Cavaliers two and0 at home one and two on neutral courts win against Villanova and then over the weekend at the bahamar in the Bahamas lost to Tennessee and St Johns Manhattan came in at 3 and2 winless though away from their home court Music Applause the 66 roie Music M here are the Cavaliers working late into that shot clock and aims the tough pullup you move the defense around at the end of the shot clock youre going to create opportunities if you get a guy to go around out on the perimeter and Ames wasnt able to get all the way to the basket but he got far enough how should Manhattan attack well I think Manhattan has got to try to get sidor involved and they s they cant turn it over if you throw the ball to the guys in the white shirts thats not a good formula for the Manhattan Music Applause offense Ames and Buchanan looking to work that screen and roll Ames took the shot McNeely open and you cannot leave him that open and Bender now pleading his case and he got called for a foul on that so mcne is going to get a chance to go to the line and if youre going to foul him out there you got to make sure he does get that ball off everybodys Down Under the basket because it was an offensive rebound oh that was not a foul called against and the foul was called away from the ball during the shot as he got tangled up with ases well he got tangled up with ases and the question becomes is that a flagrant foul and now well get a discussion and the rule on that is if you get a foul off the ball if the shooter is in the ACT if hes started his shooting motion if the fouls on the defense then the basket counts okay so its a common foul right the foul occurs right there right next to mcne in the middle of your screen and that was after he was in his shooting motion so its a defensive foul so that shot counts its a common foul so Virginia gets the ball out of bounds and they have a chance for a fivepoint play a fivepoint trip but they throw it away now we talked about the first few minutes of this half and Virginias lead seven at the break has mushroomed now to a Applause Music dozen Shaquil Bender one in green teams leading score last year Robinson the hero Friday night with the buzzer beater against Army now the quick Winston lost it to Ames and theyre going to get a foul on Winston thats his second Virginia really had problems in the Bahamas with the size and physicality of Tennessee and St Johns and Manhattan just doesnt offer those traits and Manhattan is theyre not a big ball screen kind of team and so their guys are having a tough time getting open against a very very good Virginia defensive effort to see Wahoos in the midst of an 113 run mcne belong two gets the friendly roll I also thought Ron Sanchez was very calm about the two games in the Bahamas there wasnt any hyperbole or overreaction he said were a young team as mcne gets the steel met by Bender at The Rim an outstanding defensive play Applause and the struggles for Bender continu he just was out of control there and Tim clockery was certainly open but hes not really involved in the game in that Applause way now this this is you know they needed a fast start in the second half they didnt get it so now theyre going to have to just dig down and do what they did in the first half and battle back a basket here gives Virginia its largest lead Le and Ro does just that the lead is 16 and if youre John Gallagher do you think about a Applause timeout well I dont know that you know what you need is a basket and there they got one you dont stop opponents run with a timeout you stop it with a basket and so that helps Winston the sophomore had a big game against Army 17 points five rebounds five assists and five steals and that is a kick Music ball this ACC Network womens volleyball matchup is so big it might be the best of the season number one pit number three Louisville the ACC regular season title and the number one seed in the nation on the line coverage begins tomorrow night at 7 Eastern Saunders to the left hand thats what Virginia I think would like to see Saunders do a little bit more of hes 68 240 lbs he has the bulk to play on the Applause inside the three no good by Roxboro man hadnt has to find a way to disrupt this Virginia offense they simply havent been able to do it roie that time theres a little disruption Ro left his feet with nowhere to go Winston hits the three and Manhattan still has some life its a 12point game another three by Winston hes got six thats we talked about you up the defensive pressure that gives you easier shot opportunities although that was a pretty long three back in the paint a 30 to1 advantage in points of the the paint for Applause Virginia and well get a foul that is Winstons third of the half media timeout with 5if by tro price John Gallagher in his second season is Manhattans head coach and there is a proud coaching lineage for the Jaspers Steve lapis was there before going to Villanova Fran filla our colleague was there before going to St Johns and Bobby Gonzalez before going to Sean Hall was a feeder for the old Big Applause Music East yeah not to mention you got Steve maelo who is there whos now an assistant coach for Rick patino at St Johns MCs three rattles out Winston with the three fouls over to dinkin so two point guards in the game for Manhattan and dinkin and Winston and one of the things that Jaspers have to do is take better care of the basketball they have 12 turnovers so far in this game almost 13 but Robinson able to recover that was a good cut its a very tough pass and Robinson did a nice job controlling that difference in the game right now points off turnovers 222 Edge to Virginia and Virginia was a minus 45 in their three games prior to this so thats quite a turnar around Buchanan left alone and for good reason he had never made or attempted a three in his career prior well so he could have had the element of surprise going for him but didnt work its like when you slow play pocket aces in poker Applause Bender that three goes and hes the Rex factor and he is capable of going off at any moment well theyve cut it back to seven and thats that was a wide open three hes had very few shots have been that open and if youre Virginia thats not the guy that you want to activate Applause Kofi getting ready to check in for the whoos Ames over dinkin big rebound by Buchanan and makes the most of his second a chance Buchanan did a really nice job taking advantage of the opportunity presented by the drive to the basket Robinson didnt get back quickly enough to block him out Robinson went over to help against the dribbler and Buchanan got himself in great position you know interestingly enough Anish with all the other stuff going on in this game weve had very very few free throw attempts and Virginias only had three all of them by Buchanan and he is 0 for three and now one for four and Manhattan has only had three free throw attempts well Manhattan continues to hang Applause around and theyve never Leed and it seems every time Virginias on the brink of putting the game away the Jasper Applause surge but every time you think Manhattans getting back into it Virginia surges see now that thats thats no ball movement there one pass and a shot and thats not the way Manhattans going to get back in the game theyve gotten some wide openen threepoint opportunities with ball movement what Virginias done theyve taken Manhattan completely out of their transition game sidor the rebound now the opportunities to push if not been there they try it here almost turn it over and well get a foul on the drive on McNeely its his first now the Jaspers you want to push the ball but you dont want to be out of control doing it they were fortunate to keep at that time a really nice play into transition on the defensive end by McNeely to disrupt that they wouldnt be the first team Virginias kept out of Applause Music Applause transition shot clock down to five Bender down the lane no good battle for the rebound out of bounds to Virginia Im not sure that thats one that Bender should not have taken now Kofi was right there coming at him and he may have thought he couldnt get it off over Kofi who is 6 Fe 10 but that thats a shot that Bender normally takes and he passed up that three and took a tough two how much of that is because hes in a shooting slump well I think part of it but I think the other part of it is the size of the guy coming after him yeah Kofi 610 230 Roxboro three rebounded by Kofi now if youre Manhattan thats a shot that youll take a wideopen three in transition if youre going to come back in the game though obviously you got to knock those down yeah from a pretty good threepoint shooter Ames looking for help Kofi against sidor a couple of talented Applause freshman Ames finds a cutting SA ERS nicely done that was a really good pass a nice job by Saunders just to follow the play and well get a reaching foul on Applause Ames Virginia tonight 13 assists on 24 field goals Ames with five helpers finding Saunders for the easy2 Kansas and again these early season games as the ACC found out the hard way last year they mean a lot in terms of how the conference is perceived nationally as gillards three doesnt fall and thats an excellent point Anish so the Duke Kansas game is obviously a big game I mean thats a fun kind of game the teams play early in the year but for the ACC that may be an important game because Kansas has already beaten North Carolina right now that North Carolina got behind and uh Kansas had to withstand a fury his comeback a big showcase too again for Cooper Music flag Canon setting the screen for Ames gets it back baby hook no offensive rebound that one rims out and knocked out ball to Manhattan Virginia now they missed the shot that that time but theyre doing a pretty nice job exploiting the fact that Manhattan is playing off of Buchanan so theres no real help out there on the screen so Ames is able to get by and if Buchanan rolls to the basket he has some opportunities Bender picked up by Buchanan picked up his dribble sidor has been quiet today now he hasnt been a factor at all Roxboro too much English dinkin wide open that one rims out and a foul against Applause Virginia they get tane Murray its his first the senior from Auckland New Music Applause Zealand I mean this game it continues to be really interesting if you just watch the game you think for Virginia is ahead by more than 12 and every time the Cavs seem to be on the cus of The Knockout Punch Manhattan finds a response to make it a ball game that was a really nice job by banon getting out there and preventing that threepoint opportunity shot clock winding down Bender the drive too much again I think he might have had a threepoint opportunity that he passed up now roie was close but I dont think Ros a threat to block his shot out to big size Advantage for Kofi thats roie you know Ros a guy who they brought in last year in the transfer portal and they expected big things from him and he just shot the ball very poorly all year but his shooting numbers this year are much more like they were at St Thomas in the summit League yeah where where he averaged 17 a game as a freshman for the tomies Manhattan has gone more than 4 and 1 half minutes since its last point and that drought continues but again if youre not going to move move the ball and move your players youre not going to move the defense and when you take a tough contested shot you have no rebounding opportunity and that allows Virginia to get down and get an easy one roie in double figures the fifth the SEC ACC Challenge and Dan and I were talking about it a a little while ago these nonconference games in some ways its unfair as Roxboro rattles in the three when youre in the age of the portal and teams essentially hitting a hard reset on the roster Year bye you may not even be a complete team you may not even know what your team is till you get to the New Year even February at times we saw with NC State last year yet those games in November and December those big nonconference games even the little ones they matter and there is no metric to take into account A teams qualitative growth its all numbers yeah its all numbers and Virginia look at that schedule at Florida SMU and then Memphis coming in here and Memphis probably isnt too bad they just beat Yukon right they did and Danny Danny Hurley wasnt too happy why he so onset he fell down rukan the twotime defending national champion Applause Ron Sanchez the interim head coach won his first three games including a win against Villanova and then two blowout losses in the Applause Bahamas Gillard against Murray Winston thought about the long three shot clock is down to five Roxboro puts it up got it I mean buano is right there that was a really good defensive sequence by Virginia that was a tough shot by Manhattan if youre going to settle for those kind of tough shots its going to be hard to come back nine points for the Freshman from Melbourne Music Australia Ros got 10 tonight and we get a foul on Winston and its number Applause Music four Winston in foul trouble but Roxboro Off the Bench with nine for the ja chionship as a head coach now remember in that 82 season Dean Smith got his first title at UNC well that thats really a startling thing all those guys Kofi on the Applause inside it also takes away five MEAP phon from this conference guys who when they spoke the rest of college basketball listened if you had a Coach K or a Roy Williams or a beheim opine about the strength or the perceived strength of your league it made headlines and nothing against the current coaches in this league theres some really good coaches but they dont have the cache to have that megaphone well they dont and one of one of the things that is very interesting is the perspective of these two coaches here tonight is so different Ron Sanchez and his staff they have to be worried about every single game because everyone counts on the metrics that they use to evaluate you as to whether you might get an NCA tournament at large bit manhatt does have to worry about that you know nobody from the Mac is getting an at large bid so when it comes right down to it you concentrate on building your team and thats why you play games like this obviously you get some money for coming here to play but you can test your players in really tough circumstances all youre really doing is Youre Building toward that conference tournament you only have to win three or four games and you get to the NCA tournament MCM on the drive wild layup gets the foul and if youre a team like Manhattan games like this amplify your strengths and really amplify your weaknesses you know where to go to can practice the next day and your kids your kids like to play in these kind of games as well now Manhattan in the Mac there there are now 13 teams in the mac and only the top 10 are going to the conference tournament so you got to make the conference tournament it is rivalry weekend in college football and on the ACC Network on Saturday Duke Wake Forest at noon NC State UNC at 330 and The Prime Time game with westerham Tom lugan Bill and Dana Bole is Virginia Virginia Tech interesting enough go ahead ACC now with 18 teams only the top 15 will make the conference tournament and thats you know every ACC team not going to the conference tournament is something that hadnt happened and as we saw last year you can go and win five in five days as Robinson comes up short well you dont want to make a habit of it but you can do it thats probably not how you draw it up but position kofy did an outstanding job maintaining his balance I dont know how he didnt fall down but unfortunately for him eventually his foot ended up on the line and the official is right there boy that was Applause Music Applause close he was right around this juncture where Manhattan began to erase a ninepoint deficit on Friday night against Army and they would eventually win on a steal and a basket by Wesley Robinson at the buzzer sidor has been quiet skip pass Roxboro no Manhattan has missed 11 of its last 13 Sidner has not been a factor in the game it always barely touched the ball and I think you have to credit Virginia for that theyve swallowed him up that time he had a mismatch inside but tane Murray did an excellent job hes been their best score more than 15 a game only a freshman from the Bronx mcne on the drive deflected Robinson tracks it down Bender has it poked Away by McNeely all the active hands of Virginia have been on display today its their defense that has been the key because they havent been scoring at a really high clip here either but even though they dont score theyre preventing Manhattan from scoring a 232 edge in points off turnovers as dinkin hits the little floater we get a time out from Manhattan its an 11point game 502 to go here in Charlottesville Music Music third the rust Virginia without a field goal in the last 2 and 12 minutes theyve out scored Manhattan by four here in the second half it was a sevenpoint Virginia lead at halftime but the Virginia Defense is the key I mean this is a team and traditionally they have gone into some offensive droughts and thats a pretty good shot right there thats the kind of shot they havent been giving up and that Manhattans got to do something theres only 5 minutes left in the game they have to do something to change the pace of this youve got to take the ball from Virginia and get some easier shot opportunities they will press well now theyre looking for Applause traps Virginia able to clear its a blocking foul on Gillard Giller just did not have enough patience defensively on that particular play Saunders was backing him down but watch this Gillard he moves underneath and you cant do that if he just maintains his ground hes going to get an offensive foul called against Saunders the officials are very they try very hard to call the displacement and Gillard was about to be displaced knocked down but he moved underneath Saunders and that changed the foul call at the other end Gillard atones and the lead into single digits for Virginia Manhattan continues to press but see now most teams if somebodys going to press you you want to make him pay by attacking but Virginias just trying to break the press and so now Manhattans got to play tough in the half Applause court yeah one of John Gallaghers points of emphasis was know being ready late in the shot clock Saunders leans in grabs the rebound with those bowling B ball shoulders and will get a foul I need its a held ball held ball and the possession arrow is for the Jaspers well again Virginia against this press is not trying to go down and score theyre trying to set it up in the half court and saunderss got a pretty good look there but here Sidner we talked about the fact that he hasnt been involved Applause offensively sidor nine and green was running the Baseline a moment ago you still have time to move the ball although you got to go toward the basket mismatch four fouls Kofi the block the rim and Robinson the hero Friday Night comes through thats what I was talking about that Ames was matched up inside against Robin and they couldnt find him but Robinson didnt matter to him Robinson goes down he gets he puts him on his back and thats a onehanded rebound and tipped what a fabulous play Manhattans back within Music seven seems they get to about 75 and then Virginia punches back a chance for a threepoint play by Wesley Robinson the senior from Burlington New Jersey and now the lead for Virginia is six its a twopossession game with 345 to go and Virginia has only made one basket in the last 5 and A2 minutes and you brought this up earlier if Manhattans going to press and Virginia doesnt look for an easy basket you let Manhattan off the hook Well you certainly theyre able to pressure with really without risk now you just have to execute your halfcourt offense and Manhattan I think has turned up the defensive pressure as well and Buchanan is out of the game so Virginia suddenly becomes much more perimeter oriented Ames able to draw the foul its on Gillard well Virginia here coming down the stretch what they did is they took Buchanan out of the game and theyre basically playing with a four guard lineup and they spread the court and theyre going to look to drive the ball itll be a one and one for Ames ninth team foul on Manhattan so the next one puts Virginia in the double Music Applause bonus Saturday morning at 1100 am eastern its the ACC huddle crew who gets you set for the day in football they will also be back at night after the Virginia Virginia Tech game to wrap Ed everything up both free throws good eightpoint game 320 left five players in double figures in scoring for Virginia Robinson looking for help Winston with those four fouls now Bender open and he still cant hit been a tough game for him four for 12 just to nine points and that was wide open and John Gallaghers telling his guys they dont have to foul you got to play tough defense and again Virginia theyre comfortable playing at the end of the shot clock you would expect them to do that here or not Ro looked like he forced one up but he felt it and the lead is back to double digits so Manhattan again clawing to within seven within six Virginia answers dinkin able to draw the foul on mcney his second no relation by the way to New York City mayor David dkin but again even if there isnt Devin dinkin the mayor for a team that calls itself Manhattan thats a fitting nickname isnt it even though theyre in the Bronx well that too semantics but again he was he was the mayor of the whole city Bronx is part of Applause it a George Mason transfer plays about 30 minutes plus Off the Bench averaging double figures in scoring and dinkin with both free throws cuts the lead back to Applause Music Applause Music eight not much trouble there for Virginia now Murray in the corner the skip pass hauled in by mcney Virginia can bed some clock now and Manhattans really trying to put pressure on and that should give Virginia some opportunity Ames almost lost it roie battle for the rebound one by sidor a little too much dribbling by Ames right there boy thats a nice job by McNeely to prevent the drive to the basket Robinson using the shot fake oh what a pass inside to sidor and once again a twopossession game with 140 to go that Manhattans running out of time though they really have to get some Applause Music Applause Music turnovers John Gallagher the Manhattan head coach yelling one stop from the Jaspers bench now youre getting to the point now where you have to think about fouling early in the shot clock the three by McNeely the iMac is still on now the catch and shoot three even with somebody in his face he is really some shooter and we get a whistle with 103 to go 14 points for McNeely three threepointers Manhattan now in the bonus itll be a one and one for dinkin and obviously these free throws critical for the Jaspers Ames picked up his fourth and dinkin gets the front Applause end this weeks featured mens basketball game right here on acc Network and the app it is Duke the number 11 team of the country and Cooper flag taking on Seattle Friday 6861 103 to go you dont have enough time I think You got a foul and Gillard commits the foul to send roie to the free throw line now roie interestingly enough hes a pretty good shooter and a pretty good score but he does not go to the free throw line very much four of six on the season so that is a very small sample size you would expect him to be a pretty good free throw shooter and even last year when he started 7 games only 16 free throw attempts made Seven a season ago Ro had a nice Game 12 points got the start and he makes the Applause first Winston checks in offense for defense as Gillard leaves it gives Manhattan another ball handler as well well you got to get down the court and score quickly both free throws Applause good Virginia calls a 30 second Applause Music timeout whats Ron Sanchez going over now in the Virginia huddle well one of the things you want to do is make your make Manhattan catch the ball in front of you dont let them throw it over the top and get an easy basket now youre youre playing basically like a prevent kind of Defense if youre an NFL uh cornerback but its one of those things and then once they catch the ball you do not want to foul this is you want to keep you dont want them to be able to score when the clock is not Music running Virginia is in the double bonus so a Manhattan foul against Virginia would give Virginia two free throws at the line Manhattan is in the single bonus so itll be a one and one but its a ninepoint game thre possession Applause game Virginia big Advantage with points off turnovers tonight thats been the difference Winston accelerates coughs it up and yet another live ball turnover by the Jaspers well Winston accelerated just a little bit too fast there got a foul and there it is sidor applies the foul on McNeely and at this point you dont really have much of a choice in who youre going to foul and MCN is another one of those guys he doesnt not go to the free throw line very much came into the game s to 10 one for two tonight 85 last year 80 for his career oh hes a good free throw shooter but again he does not go to the line very much and thats as you look at these Cavalier particularly their backourt guys guys who go to the line a lot of guys who attack off the dribble and Virginia just they dont have that element at this point the lead is 11 the 72 points for Virginia a season high dinkin from in close right around Ames who had four fouls ninepoint game and if thats Winston that is five and it is on Winston so he is fouled out I M Neely just used his size right there you know Winston 6 feet tall and 64 by McNeely and MCN I mean hes a strong 64 they list him at 195 190 lbs which is almost a 40 lb advantage against Winston where does virgin irginia have to improve considerably before they get into conference play well I think that one things Virginia has to do is theyve got to be able theyve got there has to be more physicality there there they dont have really power guys on the inside and so somehow you have to make up for that disadvantage and the way you do that is I think you have to attack the basket and you theyve got a lot of threepoint Shooters and they have to figure out some way to utilize them but its going to be hard you theyre calling card as defense and without physical guys its going to be hard to stop some of these teams that theyre going to play I mean Florida Memphis I mean theyve got a tough schedule coming up and thats before they get into conference play dinkin again Gillard will shoot two but the one thing I will tell you is the ability to put the ball in the basket makes up for a lot of problems and theres that one other element that always travels that Virginia has had since Tony Bennett took over and Ron Sanchez wants to keep it that way too thats defense and if they get back to their ways on defense that just by default as we saw so many times with Virginia it keeps you in Games Ames meanwhile has fouled out so he exits power back in 7463 am fing out you know two minutes ago might have been a problem but I dont think Manhattan has time its the other part of it for Virginia right Jaylen warley was brought in from Florida State to be your 67 point guard Tony Bennett retires warley hits the portal theres not that true point guard on the roster Ames roie kind of by committee right now but you can make the case they dont have a real point guard on the roster now its not a be all end all its not a death sentence you just have to be creative and Sanchez was talking to us about that before the game well I think most coaches will tell you that the points guards most important job is to guard the other teams point guard and disrupt the other teams offense and Ames has the quickness to do that but hes not a big strong Applause gu final seconds Manhattan not fouling and Virginia is going to get a hardfought win tonight and its a win where they scored s 74 points 25 points off turnovers for Virginia thats a season High the whoos shoot 54 from the field and the 74 points a season high for Virginia as well so the Cavaliers
