is balanced scoring You got to have multiple guys especially since youre not going to have Harrison today And lineup changes for both Logan I gets a start for Notre Dame and making his first career start The man with the basketball right now the freshman out of Atlanta Eric Chatfield Jr I think thats the first shot that Ive seen Kaci Reeves miss in the last 24 hours yesterday at practice Ive never seen a guy have a shooting practice like he did And hes coming in locked and loaded And one of the things for Georgia Tech is that they dont make a lot of threes but they shoot it at a high clip And Dongo the man to keep an eye on double double machine Mustaf is a guy they really have high hopes for Young player way downtown And a second straight miss for Reed Notre Dame starting out in that zone Georgia Techs got to prove that they can break the paint You dont want to have to be limited to shooting threes all afternoon Handling the basketball We mentioned getting to start his first since the middle of January Its his sixth start overall this year But no Harelson if youre just joining us Injured his ankle in practice yesterday Shot clock at five Ker to the rack Kicks it out Got to let it go Great box out right there by by Andongo cheering Isolation play for him and a reach in foul will go against Brady Poland So you look at the lineup we mentioned Chadfield starting and I in there for Harold I think that you have to see how are each team going to establish something offensively For Georgia Tech in that zone you got to get Dongo going because if you can get him going inside thatll open up that three ball And for Notre Dame we talked about the fact no Harelson You see that move by Oasis Reeds Thats one of those things I think that thats a matchup that he can win because the perimeter guys cant stop him from getting to the paint Hes your leading scoreer at 15 points per game That guy right there with the ball Hes got to have a big game today and hes more than capable Cole Certa had 34 against Virginia What a screen by Kohler And Shrewberry able to juke Reeds draws a foul and hell head for the free throw line A nice move by Shrewberry and he was able to get there and then watch this play He comes off the pick and roll again more of a pro move Hes able to get Reeves and watch right there Reeves bites on the pump fake Hes able to take that contact and now gives him opportunity to go to the line for two Braden of course the coachs son Junior from Granger Indiana For the last two games he has hit nine threepointers If he gets hot along with Serta look out Heres the thing too with both teams only two conference wins A lot of it is the league is so much better and its hard for teams as you see Chadfield having a little struggle right there with Allies pushing up on the ball Taylor out defending 40 ft from the bucket Heres Reeves again and hes off the mark One of four Hes the only Yellow Jacket to shoot so far in the game And heres Shrewsberry Bang And thats one of the things that Michael excuse me Braden Shrewberry does a great job of is catching that three in rhythm And thats one of the things if you allow a guy like that to get the bucket to go its going to be a long afternoon for Georgia Tech defensive Dongo brought it back down Nice feet underneath to Reeves and hes able to spin it through the hoop Again when you get the ball inside to Dongo good things are going to happen That last time Reeves is able to get behind the back of that defense Gets another bucket to go Well when Notre Dame sets a screen man they set a screen But Tout is a grown man out there Its a brick wall you try to fight back Is he ever 33 wearing the headband for those of you that have not seen Notre Dame play Transfer from Northern Arizona University One of the great rebounders in the country and at the shot clock off the mark cheering Taylor the rebound Ives for three and it spins around and drops in Good defense by Georgia Tech but you cannot give up those rebounds Best time to shoot a three is on that offensive rebound get out and you get arms on the board today 84 Notre Dame playing without their top two players when you also add in Marcus Burton who has been out since the month of December See Notre Dame gets this back in the eyes gets an opportunity to saddle up and get those going Hes like Yes I needed that one today And again we talked about for a team that is trying to find offense from Harelson its going to have to be done by committee And offensive rebound is going to be something that coach Damon Stomar talked to you and I about yesterday is that they got to finish out defensive possessions And they cannot give Notre Dame opportunities to get other baskets So they have to lock up those defensive possessions Child has had a really nice career He has scored over300 points has over300 rebounds Kaylor off the mark and theres a long board Kelly checks into the game for Georgia Tech screaming Im sure thats a shot theyre looking for And and Im sure if youre in Notre Dame that youll take that three out there by Dongo because again hes going to do most of his damage inside the bank Heres Cernis and able to get off the shot but Indongo rips away the rebound And good defense by Fleming allows Cern to get downhill You mentioned earlier they need him to get going Heres Musk and theyre looking for big things out of this young man And it was one of the things also that start mentioned that he said Hey hes one of those guys I feel like that he could give us a big afternoon You saw right there being able to rip by and get right down to the cup I mean hes had nice games this year He had 16 against Virginia Tech 11 against Duke and thats the first bucket for the sophomore out of Illinois Cole Cern Yeah Sers one of those hes got a lot in his bag He can put the ball on the floor You saw a good little runner right there Its something that Notre Dames going to really need Thats a nice pass by Andongo and it leads to a layin by Reed Yeah big man with the crosscourt pass Yeah bounce pass That bounce pass And then you see Kawwasi Reeds has come out understanding that hes going to be offensive minded and look for a shot today Shrewberry boy wide open under there for a moment was tout Taylor along the baseline and Dongo another rebound Irish lead by two and theres that crosscourt bounce pass again And I think he threw it out of bounds And then youve seen Georgia Tech theyve had times where they have had wins They went up and had an impressive win at North Carolina State No doubt And so right now as you come to the gut of this season this last six games all you want to do is get into the ACC tournament I mean look you never know whatll happen And case in point was NC State just two years ago but you cant win it if you aint in it And truly and both teams have been decimated by injuries as well Yes And its been hard for them but I think that right now when you look at it they still got guys that can fill it up You saw that one not go down by Raven Shrewsbury and Dungo already with four rebounds in a game Kelly going to the rack and thats a jump ball Possession hour gives it to Notre Dame Great transition defense by Notre Dame as you get back Shrewberry did a good job at tying up that ball Watch this play and you see Chaz Calli come in and one of the things is to defend without fouling And you see Shrewberry able to get his hands in there Forces that that D that jump ball Fullourt pressure for Georgia Tech checking in for the first time today Seen a lot of playing time this year The transfer from Pacific Lamar Washington But I think that if your game is inspired by what you want is you want guys going to help impact the game on the defensive end this Georgia Tech team understands is that they have to turn up the intensity You want to make Notre Dame uncomfortable Notre Dame is one of those teams that theyre going to run their sets Youre going to have to guard for the majority of the shot clock Fouled away from the ball I think theyre going to get Kelly holding Shrewberry checking into the game for the first time And this is a guy you and I were talking about We talked with coach Rusberry about today There are games you watch Sir Mohamd his most recent game against SMU Well hes got a chance to be a really good player He does because he has a good skill set where he can do a little bit of everything on both ends of the floor You see the penetration and the kick out the close out by Kuesi Reeves But back to Mohamd hes one of those guys that can give them a huge shot in the arm Reeves good bounce pass and Dango brought it down low somehow able to get it away but he threw it away Yeah one of those things again thats always played this Georgia Tech team and the turnovers but Notre Dame doing a good job of closing down that lane not allowing Dongo to get downhill You know for both these teams they started the nonconference part of their schedules at 9 and four They got off to good starts uh for Georgia Tech losses against Georgia Mississippi State and Depal and losses Titan one against Ohio State Kansas and Houston for Notre Dame They did get big wins against TCUs got a nice team and beat Missouri But then the injury started to pile up for both Georgia Techs only had two players to play in every ACC game And you know about Burton hes among the best players in the country Heres Serta Look out And good penetration by IMS whos able to force two guys to converge and get over to Cole Sera We talked about Sers one of those dudes man If you allow him to get going hell start launching them from the hashline especially over there and get them going early And Dongo with an offensive rebound head fake goes up and draws a foul against Garrett Sundra We talked about the fact that old Serto watch this penetration by forces the help is able to tee that bad boy up and gets it going Then on the other end Dongo is going to thrive Hes going to put a lot of pressure on Notre Dame this afternoon with offensive glass You want to get him going because again establishing Dongo down low will allow those threes to start coming for Georgia Tech Vongo a 70 free throw shooter cheering and a nice touch Watch his contestants spell their way to glory or disaster Catch an all new episode of Scrabble hosted by Craig Ferguson this Thursday 8 Eastern 7 central right here on the CW You and I talked about the Scrabble thing Thats for my wife Im going to get her on that Scrabble game because you are Yeah because I I told in our house we play uh English and Italian and you know my Italians pretty good Tom but she comes up with some games with some words I dont know how I Well or do they even exist I dont even know if they exist man But you know what Shes shes adamant So but she is from Italy Yep Absolutely right Shrewberry great head fake Surprised he passed up the open shot and then got out of whack there I thought that he had the first one and then he tried to force that up I think theyre arguing that Kesi Reeds may have touched the ball and that is going to be Notre Dame ball Heres the thing is that for Notre Dame you dont have Harold Youre going to need one of those avenues by Shrewsbury and also Serta where youre going to want them to get at least 15 attempts up to give them opportunity to be able to win this game And early on you have Struzberry with four you have Serta with four attempts and racing the other Great bounce pass I thought that thing had a chance to be caught by Kelly Yeah I thought Reeves wasnt really that much under control May have got bumped early I thought that looked pretty good He didnt really have real control of the ball I dont know that if Serta got his hand on it the first time and then basically Washington couldnt corral clears throat it But if youre Georgia Tech you want to make sure that you take care of the basketball because the last thing you want to do is have high turnovers early 1310 Notre Dame closing in on 8 minutes gone And heres Shrewsberry again and he hits his second three He has eight points so far And if youre Dongo Scout Report tells you you cant allow him to walk into a wide open three like that You got to be able to hedge and not allow him to get that easy look Backto back fouls with it Dongo drawing them from Sundra So he has two quick fouls and theres a timeout on the floor We talked about both teams need one of the things that they do is that theyre sixth in the ACC shooting around 35 10th and makes and only eight and a half already to a really good start this afternoon Had a good start at the line for Bai ando the junior originally from Sagal He played high school basketball in Connecticut had 13 double doubles last year He has four this year but in fairness hes had six games where he was one rebound short Yeah I mean and Dono is one of those guys that athletic put the ball to the floor active around the rim I really think that establishing him early will really get this Georgia Tech offense going because theyve got shot makers and I think that they have to take advantage of opportunities when they can get the ball to Dongo and let him go Sir Mohamd did not start Hes in the game right now Logan I got the start for the injured Jaylen Harrelson who averages 16 a game and picked right there Great body by Washington And thats one of the reasons why Washington is in the game and him hes a little bit of a pitbull as far as on the ball You see Damon Stodderemire over there telling him that hey I want you to get up on him Ryder Frost a freshman out of Beverly Massachusetts checks in for Notre Dame Shrewberry has been the man so far And Zerta theres Serta with a ball Picks up his dribble in the lane Mohamd little floater and not there cheering You talked about Washington sticking his nose right in there getting a rebound and draws a foul against Mohamd Well you and I both talked about the fact that at this point in the season know both teams are desperate for a win And if youre a coach you want a guy thats going to be out there thats going to help diver kind of generate some type of offense for you Washington you see coming out trying to get the defense going and then you see over conversation with Micah Stubberry and Sir Mohamd trying to get him to calm down a little bit Yeah Washington coming off a game against Wake Forest where in 18 minutes he did not score and he has not scored in fact the last four games and headed to the free throw line unable to get it to fall right there Jaden Mustaf will go to the line for two made great recognition out of that point that out of that pick and roll watch gets the ball and a back cut by Mustaf couldnt get that one to quite go but then for Georgia Tech already theyve got eight points in the paint and you can look at what theyve been able to do early they have not gotten that three ball to go but Rust is another guys you want to get him going Tuesday WWE NXT the North American Championship on the line champion Ethan Paige against newcomer Shiloh Hill Will the veteran retain or the rookie pull off the upset NXT Tuesday 8 Eastern 7 central right here only on the CW cheering Both free throws are good by Mustaf who has four in the game and were even at 16 with the 6 run by Tech Big man Tout bringing the rock up Say I got guard skills Hey a tout is a warrior on the glass Oh they left Certa all alone and he couldnt finish Yeah he hesitated first I thought that he had the first opportunity Little surprise He was wide open Transition defense also by Notre Dame Off the fingertips of Indongo and Tout leading the break Sera was thinking about it Heres Frost from downtown in and out Boy Andongo a rebounding machine He has seven of those already in the game cheering Cam Craft a transfer from Miami of Ohio Boy how about that story up in Oxford Ohio Watch the little of their game last night The leading scoring team in the country They average almost 90 a game Man talk about a team that gets up and down when they put a lot of pressure and they they can flat out shoot it and score the rock We were talking with Bonsi Wells Hes a MidAmerican Conference guy I went to Ball State Talking to him before the game today He watched that Miami game last night He could not believe how well they play together and how many guys they have that can really shoot Well see where it all goes Thats Well thats one of the teams that when you get into the NCAA tournament can shock some people because of the pace that they play with You see Drewberry was able to get one going And again Tom thats the guy that I think that for Notre Dame has got to be the one that carries them Hes come out of it ultra aggressive already Got 10 points Got 11 Or was that a two That was a three So hes got 11 now Three threepointers and a couple of free throws in a game from downtown That is not the game of Kelly Rebound by Craft Although Kelly has been better this year from three And Dongo beautiful lefthanded kiss off the glass And I think thats where Georgia Tech has got to make a a more concerted effort to get the ball to Dongo down low Frost is not going to be able to stop him but they keep them on the perimeter Its going to be hard for Georgia Tech to get those threes to go and Serta finally gets a roll Yeah I like the fact that with the open offense you saw Serta get there and touch the paint Be able to kind of get away from his defender sort of has seven in the game Shrewberry with 11 So they have 18 of Notre Dames 21 points so most of our games And when we win they look one way When we lose they look the other way Well and theyve done a good job of playing good defense and then getting the rebound I think that on the other end is that now you see Kazi Reeds back and he gives you a threat But where do they go now that you got Dongo out of the game with this small lineup Eric Chatfield Jr is checked back into the game Thats Reeves out on the wing and Washington trying to use that athleticism and thats going to go against Kaylor and thats his second Hes a pit bull because you look at this lineup at Georgia Tech virtually you almost got five guards out there and then you cannot continue to play on that perimeter You got to have somebody thats going to put their their head down and try to break that zone Saw Washington try to do that Crab for three off the mark Good box out there by Logan I who got the start today First since mid January and Ein trying to muscle his way in and cant get it Follow once twice got it But heres the thing is that for for Notre Dame theres no shot blocking on the floor for Georgia Tech You want to put the ball on the floor and you want to go and get downhill Break that rim You see I had two opportunities for that putback As soon as you said that and Jong go jumps off the bench but now they call him back and Kai Flemings going to come back in Reeves hes off to a nice start in this one And thats the guy from Georgia Tech also that theres no one on Notre Dames team that can stop him oneonone You want to clear out allow him to be able to get downhill And you see right now hes got a pretty good first half going for him Sure does He has eight points for the Yellow Jackets Threepoint lead for Notre Dame 727 left Serta bang That guy can absolutely light it up And you know it doesnt take much time for him to get it up And we saw him He had a careerhigh 34 points in that loss to Virginia Right now it doesnt turn up And Serta over the last five games is behind the arc 0 for seven for Georgia Tech And turnover is a huge part of the game Georgia Techs turned it over eight times And NB only once And theres a home bounce right there IF YOURE GEORGIA TECH HOW DO YOU COME OUT OF THE TIMEOUT AND YOU LEAVE COLE SERA wide open And again we talk about this is a dude thats got the neon light If he gets a couple to go that last time he doesnt care if hes one on five Hes going to let that baby fly No doubt about it Give it off to Andongo Swings it crosscourt as hes done And Fleming to the rack There was contact there No foul Fight for the rebound and a big fella comes away His second field goal A nice battle by on Dongo And so for for Notre Dame what theyre doing theyre sending another guy And so Dongo gets that ball out of his hand and Georgia Tech right now living in that paint Taylor wide open in the center drains it Big fellas LIKE I GOT GUARD STEALS GIVE ME THE ROCKET IM GOING TO CREATE FOR YOU 610 freshman from Fisers Indiana And another miss from threepoint land Boy thats a difference in this game Eight threepointers for Notre Dame none for Georgia Tech Back door cut Beautiful feed from Shrewsberry and Tout his first basket Well Toutin saying you know what going to play intense Hes going to do little things You know normally hes going to rebound Hes going to set screens That last time Notre Dame was having a problem bringing the ball up Hes like you know what Ill bring it up Why is Georgia Tech converging on him Im not sure But hes one of those guys thats definitely been a huge playmaker for them this afternoon Georgia Tech needing a basket badly Shot clock down to seven Must will cut it loose First three of the game Boy the rambling wreck Man nice bucket by Mustaf You realize that Notre Dame was doing a good job of closing off the gaps Decides to pull up for that Hes one of those guys again that can give you points and bunches That makes it a ninepoint game Notre Dame in front Shot clock down to 10 Looking for a tout to make the cut to the basket there and it never happened Oh Kelly missed Dongo had a little bit of a mismatch over there Real try Spun out of there and last touch by Andongo Notre Dame ball That transition opportunity You had Dong go wide open against ION You got to recognize music when youve got mismatches like that You got to get the big fella to rock especially when you run the floor Fighting Irish with the ball Under five to go here in the opening half from South Bend Indiana Shrewberrys had a big half He has 11 Sle leading the way with 13 Shot clock at five Active hands by Dongo You see Shrewsbury is asking for another screen I think there were 5 seconds left to go Heres Georgia Tech Any type of screen action Youve got to try to double team You dont want to allow Serta or Well you just said that He had a pretty good look I held my I held my breath because I thought he was going to get one up Must has seven for Georgia Tech And Dongo leads the way along with Reeds each with eight And Dongo tries to add to it and gets a favorable roll So a quick four nothing run Five nothing run now for Georgia Tech to get within seven Dongo doing a good job of carrying in this Georgia Tech offense Sir Mohamd back in there for Notre Dame and Shrewberry Oh my man if youre Chaz Kelly thats a simple switching You got to understand this dude is already on fire You cannot allow him to come down and get underneath Damon starter just shaking his head disgustedly over there Thats exactly what he was talking about in practice yesterday He said This is basketball 101 stuff fellas Especially on a guard to guard switch If you got a guy that knows and wants to shoot that shoot the three Kelly forced it up there off the side of the backboard Not a good offensive possession there for Georgia Tech Notre Dame 10point lead 305 to go Shrewberry has four threepointers in this game and a reachin foul against Craft So man oh man Serta has three Shrewberry has four Auto parts season series kicking off from Daytona Beach Florida Boy the pictures from there looks pretty dog on nice right about now Yeah that weather is probably sizzling down there I wouldnt mind just kind of hanging out go and watch a little some some auto racing there Tom Absolutely Talking about it raining for the great American race perhaps tomorrow but it looks good today for our race And Certa got bumped and that will go against David Reagan who just jumped in And heres what you have to recognize If you got your big out on the island you got to get over sooner because again you know that there are two dudes for Notre Dame that are actually rolling right now Thats Ser and Shrewsbury And so if Im looking at the defense and my big is out on an island Ive got to make sure that Im ready to help and I dont leave him out there That is one smooth stroke for Ser Last year this guy averaged two points a game and now hes become one of the top scorers not only for Notre Dame but in the conference over the last three weeks But theres nothing like empowerment when you get a guy like that that normally does not get the ball in his hands And then you talked about the fact not having Marcus Burton you need someone to step up and he showed and give me the rock I can produce And then thats going to allow coaches to give you a little bit more flexibility and freedom Reeves for a three and then you knew that would have left his hand But heres the thing a little innout action You were able to get the ball inside Dango realizes someone comes over to help You get it out to Kazi Reed Now for Georgia Tech you got to get stops as well as that three ball has been going As you see your boy HES LIKE I GOT A FLAMETHROWER I got a flamethrower Keep giving it to me Georgia Techs got to do a better job in how they are allowing Notre Dame to get those wide open threes My goodness Sa with 18 He is hit four threes Shrewberry has hit four threes And Notre Dame has hit 10 threes Trying to answer Oh boy Here we go Now you you sit back and Kesi Reeves shot a quick little look Hes like you think you get you got threes in your back pocket So do I All right team starting to warm up a little bit now Georgia Tech win most of this half without a single three Now all of a sudden has three in its last four attempts Bruceberry off the mark and knocked out of bounds by Tech And again we you see Cole Serta on that little handoff And again a little late to the party Hes like Let me get that up And then you see Kawasi Reed is like You know what Put your hand up if you want to I understand I got a three ball in my pocket as well Sort of again My goodness THE HEAT CHECK BOY WHAT YOU SAY YOU BETTER COME OUT OF HERE IF YOURE NOT familiar with my game Step up Five threes for Serta He has 21 We said in the opening minute that Serta was capable of putting up 30 plus in a game Hes done it against Virginia already this year and hes well on his way today He say Allow me to reintroduce myself If you didnt know now you know And again that pick that pin down action We talked about the fact that with tout he set such a good screen that if youre the defender youre going to have to hedge If youre dongo you have to understand you cant allow Serial to get that one up All of a sudden now theyre putting Mustafa pretty much blanketing him but now the switch I going to go to the basket Thought about it Good defense by Mustaf Shot clock down to seven Shrewberry lays it off for Tal Great pass to Ims and rejected at the basket 12point lead for Notre Dame Nearly a takeaway Shot clock at 21 cheering Game clock at 23 Reeves again And now Notre Dame will hold for a final shot 15 ticks until halftime So heres the thing I put the ball in either Cole Seras hand for a pick and roll action or what I do is I try to give him a pin down This balls got to go in Sas hands Sir Mohamd to the basket muscles his way in Not there And thats the way the half will come to an end But the story of this one the fighting Irish hit 11 weeks of pure raw racing power begins today 4 Eastern 1 Pacific only on the CW Youre a Georgia Tech you got to come out immediately and try to establish something inside Talked about the fact that Dongo was able to to get rolling You got to be able to get a bucket and then you got to open up with a stop Well they got to switch So Andongo backing his way in and Kaylor able to strip it from behind punch it out of there And another turnover for Georgia Tech Thats an offensive foul by Tal Man good defense by by Ree And if youre Tal you dont need to You got a smaller guy Just take the ball and go Thats just play by Tes and then he decides to just try to bully him over Its one of the things about bigs that last time even with Dongo you had Kaylor on you Just go The more you sit back and you wait you dont worry about the double team You force them to double and you go go immediately Dongo 25 ft away from the basket and they tried the give and go there off the pick and roll and its another turnover for Georgia Tech Active hands by Notre Dame Good save by Kaylor 11 turnovers for the Rambling Wreck including their first two possessions of this second half Shrewberry thought about it didnt pull the trigger Shot clock at five Hell go to the rack and had it stripped out of there by Chadfield who just rips it away And at the other end a lay in the first bucket for Akai Fleming and he averages 10 a game And nice play by Chadfield on the drive by Shrewberry And then again you get one to Fleming wide open But if thats Georgia Tech what you want to do is continue to try to deny those first and second options to Shrewsberry and Serta Here is Serta Dribbled it off his foot Oh theyre going to call a reachin foul I guess here on Fleming But if Im Damon Stymi Im okay with that because what you want your guys to do is you want them to get up and play hard aggressive defense When you do that you make it a little more difficult for Certa and for Shrewsbury We talk about those are the guys that have really been killing them on on Norday men Shot clock at seven Shrewberry defended by Andongo And a little fade away in the paint and he gets it to go Hes got 16 Yeah Shrewberry did a good job Realizing he had Dongo on him was able to touch the paint gave him a little bit of a chicken wing to get some separation that pull up First basket of this second half for Notre Dame nearly 215 is passed here in the second half If you werent with us earlier the top scorer for the Fighting Irish Jaylen Harelson the freshman from the state of Indiana injured his ankle in practice yesterday and is in street clothes today So youre thinking Notre Dame could be in trouble Well at halftime they were on pace for 90 Brees in and out Good defensive possession for Notre Dame Georgia Tech has not been able to find anything as far as some type of consistency offensively ball will belong to a fighting Irish You see that last time Dongo doing a better job of stepping out on Shberry and what theyre trying to do is make sure that they hedge and double So far in this first half second half Georgia Tech doing a better job in getting out on the shooters The other thing is is that you have to be able to get your offense clicking coming to you Coming to you cheering applause drive by IMS that last time One of the things you do against an aggressive defender is that you try to blow by and watch play by he gets there Washington a little late gets up and calls for the goend IMS had a nice game His first start since mid January And thats where indongos got to take it to the side Hes got to I mean no one was there You have to finish that up Georgia Tech is trying to find a way to get you the rock And those are those turnovers that really infuriate coaches Youre trying to get back in this game Still plenty of times Youre done You got to get that ball and just go right to the bucket Fullourt pressure to get it in the hands We were talking about Logan Ives getting a start today He averages three points per game He has seven They were going to need scoring from somewhere and theyve gotten a pile of it from Serta and Shrezberry but you know chipping in here and there this guy right here and hell add to it H has done a good job understanding that Georgia Tech is locking up Shrewsberry and also Serta You get that big and dango realizing that if I can get him to open his hips get downhill with my right hand Youve seen two big drives by now A 16point lead Dribbling into traffic is Washington And therell be a foul against Notre Dame Its going to go against I Georgia Tech you got to be disciplined to keep running your sets You have not been able to get downhill with this defense from Notre Dame Theyre doing a good job of closing off those gaps in the pockets This is the guy that they really need to get going Had seven points in the first half Pull up jumper Too strong and tapped back by Tout Here comes Notre Dame the other way And tout to the basket Beautifully done with a left hand Cout realized he had dango anticipating come up with a handoff Big fellas like Give me an opportunity I can get rolling at 4 Eastern today Georgia Tech has done a good job of not allowing Notre Dame to get any threes but then theyve had the blowbyss and Notre Dame has been able to extend this lead to 18 If youre Georgia Tech you got to find some offense They have struggled in this second second half and then yet another turnover Hines good head fake cutting Taylor offensive foul Notre Dame ran out of a two there And we have another this time media timeout The fact that you look in this second half four turnovers out of seven possessions Theyve had one field goal made and theyve got to find a way to get some b some buckets because again youre not gonna get you see a nice move by Kazi Reed and I think that with this lineup smaller lineup you got to find a way to generate some type of stops Theyve done a better job of not being able to allow them to get those threes up but you got to clamp down and create something with your defense Breeze has 16 his first bucket here in the second half But now needing defensive stops and thatll be a hold on a mismatch Must stop trying to stay with the taller tout Well heres the thing is that Georgia Tech coaches over there whistling and and asking for that to be a shooting foul because they understand that Carson Tal is not a great free throw shooter Well its interesting talking with coach Rusberry before the game You know Tout is just 17 of 47 from the free throw line this year So you know look in close games and Notre Dames had a pile of close games Teams recently have tended to foul tout put him on the line take their chances and the dilemma for Shrewsbury is hes their best rebounder right Well I I think that its just a matter of playing the numbers because again you keep him on a defensive possession especially in the gun of the games and then basically offensively you look to sell them out but then you see him already out and then bring against Sundra big first half and thats his first attempt of the second half Its off the mark and Reeves got bumped No call Thought that was a mis call It looked like he was able to He got bumped there Sure did by Sir Mohamd Then Mohamd falls down but able to get it to his teammate Sundra whos checked in Will fade away and he got it to go for Derek Sundra And thats what youre going to have with a small lineup for Georgia Tech Someone like Sundra has got a good skill set You get him the ball down there and realize that he can get the shot off as he want You see Fleming on the penetration Weve talked about the fact that with the smaller lineup for Georgia Tech you get the ball in to Sundra Watch Sundra here realizing that Ive got a smaller guy in me and Mustafa and all I got to do is get to a place and then rise up and shoot cheering Tomorrow CW womens basketball back Virginia heads out west to take on Stanford Thats tomorrow at 2 Eastern 11 Pacific only on the CW Fleming got them both His first two trips to the free throw line He has four in the game all four in this half You see Georgia Tech extending their pressure again trying to find some way to turn over Notre Dame but Notre Dames done a good job as far as handling the ball Theyve got a lot of guys out there on the perimeter Mohamd I sa and also Struberry All of them are very good ball handlers Sir Mohamd into the lane and he had made the decision he was going up no matter what Hes able to run down the loose ball and now to the rack Oh man what a shot that was And you see him flex the pitch over at Notre Dame He was like Hey look he cant guard me Great movement and be able to counter the finishing at the the cup He has six here in the second half designs who got the start today and 11 points in a game Thats a big lift Woo Little fadeaway short and you notice that Notre Dame understands that Georgia Tech doesnt have great threepoint shooting out here So theyre packing the bait Yellow Jackets are not allowed to be able to get to the basket You see the blow by Ser and then the goend by Kesi Reeves First bucket of the second half for Seru at 21 in the first half Watch this blow by You got to honor the fact hes a threepoint shooter Then late on the recovery Lacy Reeds comes to that ball is blocked late How about Cole Certa afternoon that hes having We talked about him in the first half for the 21 points Largest lead of the game now for the Fighting Irish 5939 I tell you if somebody would have said knowing that Harelson was going to be out for this game and Notre Dame would have a 20point lead Make it 18 on the nice drive Good second half so far here by Aai Fleming But back to your point though you and I realized that not having Harelson meant that you had to have other guys step up And one of the things for Notre Dame is that the threepoint uh shot was something as big as UC Ser let one go Good challenge by Dongo I dont think that anyone anticipated for them to come out and knock down 11 threes in the first half when this is a team that on average only makes about eight and a half You shoot about 35 But they were able to get what they wanted Georgia Tech on the other end has not been able to crack the paint as much as they probably wanted You watched today see how many guys they actually have sitting there in the paint and then theyre co closing the gaps on all dribble drives Tell you this guys decided hes going to start making things happen Thats a freshman from Atlanta Akai Flemmy Well and heres the thing is that he understands is that they need points Theyve done a better job in how theyre guarding the ball from Notre Dame but then you have to be able to manufacture some some points Reach in foul by Washington Fleming has eight points here in the second half You see again still plenty of time but the way Notre Dame has been running I like the fact that how theyre running their offense You see Ives gets a breather and Sundrum bringing in Kaylor and also TA Still a very small lineup for Georgia Tech You see Dango back in the game Its going to be a foul on Fleming Thatll be his second foul and the fifth for Georgia Tech in this second half Closing in on the 12minute mark talked about how both these teams really needing wins over their last handful plus of games in conference play to qualify for the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament 15 of the 18 teams will make it right now Both of these teams would be on the outside looking in Mohamed and the rebound comes away to Washington pushing ahead Heres Fleming again Hes had a big second half Nice play by Serta Lets get a hand on that And with 1140 left to go Notre Dame 59 Georgia Tech 43 This is against SNU Syracuse needs to keep winning Absolutely And when you see how these teams we talked the fact that youve got six games going and theres opportunity for a lot of teams to gain ground and also to lose ground You know in this one right now for the most part Notre Dames done a great job of how theyve been able to defend Georgia Tech and UC It may be tout or actually it looks like its going to be Kaylor Kaylor thats four Thats four And again you see that 16point lead Youre still talking about a little over 11 minutes The one thing thats not working in Georgia Techs favor is that they have not been able to get some consistent threepoint shooting And theyve done a better job in how they defended and limited at Notre Dame and their threes All right So Georgia Tech trailing by 16 cheering with 1130 to go from South Bend Indiana And another foul And this ones going to be the 16 foul This is against Mohhamd And thats his third Well and heres the thing As Georgia Tech is able to be a little bit more aggressive and trying to get to the paint if they stack up those fouls and get into the bonus free throw shooting is a thing thats going to be really critical for them You see Motov go to the basket now This will be a twoshot foul for Mustaf cheering When you get the free ones you cant miss them Hes a 65 shooter Cant leave problems on the table You have to get everything that you can get cheering This guy since ACC play has started cheering has gotten better and better You know last year he got a little bit of playing time He sent him out of playing time in fact but now a regular and is playing his best basketball of his young career right now Thats really good defense by Fleming Really good Probably one of their better defensive possessions You saw they were able to chase Notre Dame off of their first and second options You saw them flo flying around that penetration active hands If youre Damon Starter this is what you want Now what you do is you got a good stop You got to be able to get a bucket on the other end Starter has been very frustrated today Its been a frustrating year I I found it just so uh rare lets put it that way As heres a three ball and knocked there and Dongo had the rebound lost the handle I comes up with it and Notre Dame headed the other way You know our meeting yesterday he came walking right over to you as heres I for a three Hes had a raining Hey hes had an afternoon We talked about Shrewsberry and Serta but I think when you look at IMS and what hes been able to do I mean he has really come in and he has had a great afternoon already 14 points and again great penetration finish But watch the penetration I realize you know what sometimes guys get into a good rhythm to step back there Knocks down that three Hes had an efficient six of 11 two for three five boards two assists His third game this season in double figures He had 13 against Clemson That is his season high And now today hes gone by that with 14 And we talked in the opening one of the keys is that Notre Dame have multiple guys step up And I think I has been one of those guys along with Shrewberry and also Serta Hes had a great afternoon so far Well thats been the trio Washington to the lane Left hand fade away and I another rebound for Notre Dame If youre Georgia Tech you can knock into your agree pass Big fella running in the finish Talking about a dive cheering Yeah he got the rebound at one in and has beat everybody down the And thats Want to Thats Want to And we talked about tout and what he does may not always show up on this on the score uh card but he has had a great afternoon as well Another long rebound on a missed three Serta Little bumping with Jack Field and tipped by Georgia Tech out of bounds Watchtow his screen right there Big fella understands trying to get some runs You know big dudes they get tired of just rebounding and also setting screens He said Hey give me an opportunity to get see me rolling Carlson Tal and he uh you talked about it uh a mature guy somebody that comes in that gives you the little dirty work that you need He has done a lot and they give the big fella another opportunity Good defense by Washington Tout looking for the foul Felt he was hit on the arm Were under 10 minutes to go Washington the southpaw for three Yeah Georgia Tech just could not get it going I mean again when you look at their afternoon 3 for7 this is a team that normally shoots it at about 36 but they dont have a lot of makes good ball movement that was off to mark when it left his hands you can see it standing right in front of us and its off Georgia Tech Notre Dame basketball you see Fleming and we down there trying to fight and fight tal for that rebound thats a grown man thats a grown man and a big dude that youre trying to keep off the boards What a play Designed play What a play Basically you get that little wrap around You get Cole Serta wide open Take fell asleep Thats one of the things you have to hedge on that Washington nearly losing the handle Pay attention how Notre Dame has been able to keep Georgia Tech on the perimeter You see a little penetration right there trying to play through contact Thats one of the things thats plagued them Those guards get down there not able to finish And then I the other way kicks it out to Mohhamd And TA the big offensive Oh here we go again with rare miss Look at TA on the board Serta for three screaming Tow trying to get another one The big fell as he pounds his chest SITS THERE AND SMILING AGAIN We talked about the fact that with this lineup no shot blocking and big rebounding And you see what the big fellas SAY LET ME LET YOU HEAR IT You know WE WERE TALKING about what two right I mean what two and a crowd going crazy for this guy That last exchange is all about what two Its his 149th college game his 146th college start And we told you closing in on 1400 career points He has over300 career rebounds transferred after 5 years at Northern Arizona University where he missed two seasons with injuries and now his first at Notre Dame effort like that gets to be contagious with a team that when youre your back is against the wall and we talked about it in the opening the fact that between Georgia Tech and also their game that theyve had guys in and out of the lineup with injuries and unfairly you have put been put in a position where you need guys to step up and so with not having Harelson in the lineup town has been one of those guys again thats given them a lot of effort this afternoon boy on the glass Notre Dame here in the second half led by Tal a 163 advantage on the glass Well and a lot of that is that when you give Dongo a breather Georgia Tech has not been able to have anybody else and theyve had to go with that small lot of nothing but guards Roseberry dribbled it off his foot out of bounds Rare turnover for the Irish today talked about Georgia Tech has 13 of them Thats seven for Notre Dame Yeah And youve seen that the most of the parts theyve been able to get what they want And for Georgia Tech theyve had their struggles of how theyve been able to not probe that paint And again Notre Dame a good job of being able to helping those gaps and force Georgia Tech into difficult shots And a threepointer Hes been the man in the second half And thats Fleming And Fleming has come out I mean Georgia Tech we talked about the fact that in the second half theyve had some struggles offensively but Akai Fleming he has been one of those bright spots especially in the second half Well he has 11 points in the second half He did not score in the first 20 minutes closing in on 7 minutes to go in South Ben Serta at 21 and a half If youre just joining us Notre Dame hit 11 threepointers in the first 20 minutes Serta and Shrewsberry combining for 35 points In fact those two guys outscored Georgia Tech is 18 And heres the thing is that Georgia Tech did a better job of limiting Notre Dame Theyve only made one three but what Notre Dame has done is you see Cole Sur knock down that first two is that they have not settled to try to force threes We talked about the fact that IMS has done a better job of getting downhill you know and Cole Certa is one of those dudes Hes defin hes like a threelevel type of score not only a threepoint shooter he can put the ball on the floor get all the way to the bucket As you see Chadfield throw one into the stands Miscommunication between he and Fleming if youre at Georgia Tech thats how your afternoon has been And Damon startm talked about they cannot afford to turn up the ball the way they have Shrewberry wide open for three and a rare miss You know look you you you talk to people who cover You live in Atlanta A lot of people have not been happy the way this season has gone for Georgia Tech The same thing holds true for those that follow Notre Dame Yeah But you know look when you have the number of injuries and I get why people talk about it being a disappointing season I get it You get it Were all fans you know But the bottom line is lets start with Shrewberry I mean when Burton goes down early in the year and man now youre scrambling Yep And for Damon Styomire we talked about hes not had his full roster for any game this entire season I mean theyve lost guys for months at a time So is Notre Dame outside of just Burke So its tough to get it going Im going to give you an aha moment because when you look at both programs the seasons that the in the the Notre Dame football team had it comes right into basketball the season that Georgia Tech football had coming into basketball You got a lot of fans that are excited about the way the programs have been You got a lot of alumni and supporters that come into basketball and they say Hey there are expectations for both programs Y as much as you may want to understand it you dont really want to hear it because again its almost like well hey we were coming in for both programs and you expected them to be further up in the standings and the fact that youre dealing with uh a lot of injuries You dont expect the results that you get Yeah Mohamd bounce pass to Ives He tried to bounce it Look at getting on the floor Kicked out of bounds Last touch by Georgia Tech and and you know a lot of coaches behind the scenes we get in the locker room they have certain like you know hustle awards that they get you know if Notre Dame continues to play along this pace and they win this game Im sure Michael Shberry is going to probably give an MVP warning in that locker room to Carlson Psalms I mean obviously you had guys do great shot making You see try to get that ball in and Don goes to be whistled for that foul But when youre fighting for your playoff life so to speak you want guys to give that type of effort because when youre showing the the tape of when we go to the next game you point to the effort of Carlson Tals You dont sit back and say Well hey we made this we made that Its the effort that you want to be contagious Okay we talked about this young man his issues at the free throw line He misses the first one so that means hes 17 of 48 for the year and Dongo Hey good rebound Good rebounding positioning by Dongo in the putback Thats his first field goal of the second half Had those two free throws a moment ago Six minutes to play and a timeout for Notre Dame And you see right there Michael Truth is so a nice break after all the snow in this part of the country Im a Chicago kid Upper 50 Upper 50s is like 75 Youre right about that I walk my dogs whether its nine or 90 and there have been some cold walks here lately Ive seen a lot of the kids out jogging around in tshirts and you see Cole Sa picking up where he left out and the end of hustle play almost getting that deflection We said Certa before the game might have to deliver another 30point effort Little did we know he has 30 Look how far behind and he does not hesitate Told you that hes got that kind of range where youll see him pull up with the logo I mean right now you look at his afternoon 30 points six for 10 I mean hes closing in on that careerhigh He had 34 in that loss against Virginia a few weeks ago So theyre going behind the back Defending by Kelly and the shot clock down to 15 for Notre Dame Hes going to let this go Look he got a little swag You can tell hes feeling it too Oh hes wide open Oh good defense Yeah it was by Reeves able to get a hand on that pass They were looking for Serta and then Fleming has been the man in the second half and hell go to the line Thatll be Sunder of four on him Well if I am Damon Stomire when Im going Im trying to pick out some positives from this game tape is that Akai Fleming in the second half he has definitely come in and and grabbed that rope a little a little tighter because he has been the guy that when Georgia Tech was struggling offensively to find somebody has come out and has really been impressive this second half I mean its not like hes not capable now uh you know last year its a young man playing at Atlanta overtime and he injured his knee 10 games into the season So you know he he was thought to be one of the great players in the state of Georgia and missed all that time but since coming cheering back and especially in this second half today he has been dynamite I got a chance to see him play He played at Osurn High School Not far from uh where my old stomping grounds in And this is a guy that again hes going to be a really good player Yeah he is Yeah Because music of his ability to put the ball on the floor Hes athletic and he plays um hes aggressive trying to get downhill And I bet you he goes 200 lb by this time next year About 180 right now but hes got that frame where you can tell he can put on a lot more muscle Hes only 18 years old Uhoh But I tell you and one of the things Georgia Tech was they had Sundra over there or maybe its Kayla they they were trapping and then Serta just kind of hangs out already 33 points careerhigh seven threepointers in this game for Cole Serta One of the great threepoint shooters in the country And theres a three and a long rebound Notre Dame in front by 23 with 423 left Youre sure a career home Hey this dude man again when youre playing for a coach like Michael Shrewsbury understands that you got some guys down he was like you know what Cant guard me 35 points Career high for certified year Unbelievable Unbelievable laughter Hey by the way the alltime Notre Dame record for most points by a player in an ACC game belongs to Marcus Burks May remember he had 43 against Cal last year And theres a three by Chapfield You see Georgia Tech extending their pressure Timeout by trapped in the corner Serta is sitting on 35 Youre watching CW to focus just on one guy and then in the second half you had IMS come out and he got going when Georgia Tech was doing a good job on defending both of them When you got three dudes out there its pretty hard You got to pick your poison You see Georgia Tech doing a good job and then 5 seconds Yeah Mohamd looked like had a couple of chances to get that ball in bounds and waited too long So Georgia Tech will get it underneath its own basket Under four minutes to go Well he hit one a minute ago Figures hell try it again And what a game its been You know with all the talk about Sera and Shrews very early on you pointed out I has had an outstanding game I turn Yeah it looked like hes grabbing at his hamstring right there He He may need a timeout or need a substitution Watch him Hes over there grabbing at that left leg Rubberry got bumped got trapped got slapped No call And they get it out to sir Twoon one and hell just pull it out Lets see if is going to the rack He is got bumped and hell go to the free throw line to shoot a one and one I told you that dudes got a little swag to this game Tom You can tell the way he moves and its not about him at just trying to stack up points You can tell when hes going after it He knows that he can go give you a bucket You see substitution for Logan IMS right now Serna now with 36 If youre just joining us a career best He is five of five from the line Well I mean depending on with him up 20 right now 21 Interesting to see how long Micah Shrewsbury keeps him in because if he does hes got every shot at the 40 ball going up sitting on 37 now and a threepointer in the corner again by Kelly And a nice shot by Kelly Paul was able to swing over give him a wide open look in the corner Lot of bumping going on back there at Chatfield and Shrewberry And Braden will go to the line to shoot a pair He had 14 points to Shrewberry in the first half Only two here in the second They three They havent needed him to score Well Georgia Tech did a better job of trying to lock up the the threepoint shooters and Shrewberry and also Serta but then Shrewberry has not been able to really get going and had the opportunities You see him go to the line for two Next week you and I will see this Georgia Tech team Talked about how tough their schedule is over the back half of the conference season We will see them a week from today at Louisville Boy Louisville looks like with Mike Brown Jr back now Uh look out Did you get a chance to see that night that he had 45 Yeah I mean this kid I mean even when we did his first game back against Virginia Tech talk about a dude that can go get it I mean I know NBA scouts are really high on him and his ability to just as a playmaker and he makes everyone else around better and and he gets it He he he really he really has an amazing skill set You know two days after you and I were there uh they played on a Saturday It was his first game back They had to go to Duke uh less than 48 hours later and they got kicked around by Duke Dave Louisville had a bad game but uh make no mistake about it as that one is saved Nice play by Sheffield to get that ball and Mustaf rattles in a three But Louisville as games are now starting to build Thats a team to keep an eye on come the ACC and NCAA tournament Well and thats the thing is that when you look at them and how they play theyve got shot makers Theyve got guys that that are theyve got bigs that can play and and guard the guard the rim that can get outside Thats one of those teams that when you see them in a neutral sight thats a team that I think that really could really give you some trouble because point guard play is going to be important Youve got role players They play really good defense Theyre an uptempo type of team as well Interesting to see like you say when the ACC tournament comes around but also when you get into the NCAA tournament This is a team that can have a shot at going to the final four Well you know last year was very disappointing after the bounceback year they had under Pat Kelseys first season and he got beat in the first round of the tournament I think everybody was surprised by that as Kellys hit his third threepointer this second half You see Georgia Tech continue to make buckets and then extend this pressure They want to try to to to lengthen this game You see Michael Shrewsbury over there talking to his guys about passing and not accepting the double team But how about this league too I mean the the way when you look at the teams that right now that could obviously get an NCAA bid when you get past the Dukes the Carolinas the Miami the Louisvilles Uh there are there are teams out there right now depending on how things go You see Kaylin missed the front end of that It was excuse me Sundra I think that the ACCs got a good chance of getting maybe six possibly 17 I think maybe more than that if you had to decide today I mean most of the projections that Ive seen recently had eight to nine You know you got teams like well NC State among others that are sort of you know hanging around in that gray area SMU although I dont think theres any doubt about it Both of those teams are tournament teams SMUs got a nice team They do They they get up and down I mean they got shot makers And you know that again thats another team cheering And lets lets admit it that to win in this league and even in the tournament you got to have good good point guard play And you got to have a dude that when you need it can go get you a bucket And SMU has multiple guys that can go get you a bucket And a great point guard in Buffy Miller You see the penetration by Greg Shrewberry was able to sell and get two defenders up Draws that that that contact You know the biggest news in the ACC this week though by far was you know last weekend North Carolina beat Duke in that thriller and then Caleb Wilson the other night breaks his hand and hes going to miss some time Thats a huge hit Thats huge for them because Hubert Davis and his team that you know they have been in a position where you know you have a a huge win at home in that rivalry against Duke and he is a guy averaging 20 points a game Then you turn around and you see Chadfield knock down another three You go on the road and lose to Miami Interesting to see how long is he going to be out because again as you get to this midpoint of February March is right around the corner Interesting to see how long are they anticipating him being out Good pass by Serta Foul to East Hunter will go to the free throw line We are at a minute 11 left So Notre Dame um already without their big star of course Marcus Burton going all the way back to December They had an injury to the guy whos been their leading scoreer since then Jaylen Harlson in practice yesterday There you see him on the bench Boy what a good looking freshman he is But at any rate uh you know I think if youre just somebody looking at okay what what might happen here today you might have thought you know Notre Dame could be in a little trouble They have been very very good in all aspects of theyve taken care of the ball theyve hit threes theyve rebounded and they were able to execute their game plan with Georgia Tech Georgia Tech came out early They were able to get the ball inside Notre Dame limited them and they were able to stop the gaps Right now you see Georgia Tech actually launching the threes and getting them up But again one of the things that really helped them is that you were able to limit Georgia Tech on one end and you got that three ball going really early I think that was one of the separators for them is that you get 11 threes in that first half Thats definitely going to be one of those things thats going to allow you to be able to set yourself up for success So this will be Notre Dames third win inside the Atlantic Coast Conference And we told you going into play today the Irish two games back from trying to be able to qualify for the ACC tournament So too is Georgia Tech Just got it off before the shot clock and thatll be a violation Want to say thanks for Brian Oliver looking so dapper today to Johnny O the official apparel partner of CW court size Everywhere we go I get compliments about these Johnny As do I Theyre nice Ive had coaches come up to me and say Make a deal You get me one of those babies and I Ill get you something dialed in with my school All names Im leaving out of that I dont blame you Yeah Down to the final 20 seconds and shot clock turned off What an effort today Look people have been critical of both of these teams in their seasons And you know for Micah Shrewberry today as he shakes hands and a big hug with Damon Stadmire Shrewberry has to feel very good I think he might be saying to him Hey look I I know what youre going through Im in the same boat All right you can show what a
