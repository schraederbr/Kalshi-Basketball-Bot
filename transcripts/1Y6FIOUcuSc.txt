Leonard Hamilton twoway guard he can score at all three levels he can defend multiple positions and create some offense from his D Georgia Tech last started 20 in conference Play Back in the 056 season referees tonight Bert Smith John Gaffney and Matt Potter Debbie told you about the two freshman in the starting lineup there is a third today and ibraim aako so Damon Stout going with the youth movement as conference play begins he was very blunt with us he said uh frankly Im going to play the guys who give us the best chance to win so when youre playing Florida State you have to have your pressure package in ball fakes back door Cuts High post entries because theyre going to go after everything up the line one pass away shot clock down to three heres Miles Kelly Georgia Techs leading scorer had to force that one he has been in a shooting slump here come the nlls Watkins they leading score the Baseline Drive the drop off green no good and a battle for the rebound down low oh we get a whistle Georgia Tech is an outstanding offensive rebounding team an AG 14 a game leads the ACC but theyre at the bottom of the league in field goal percentage and threepoint percentage so theyre going to have to be able to get points in the paint get to the free throw line and make things challenging for Florida State with ball reversal a lot of Georgia teex offense comes off of those missed shots getting to the free throw line put backs Florida state will go 10 11 deep they will bring incredible effort the one thing you always know at of Leonard Hamiltons team is they going to play hard now will they play connected thats what theyre searching for in their rotations warley to the rim and the rebound down go and we get a quick foul down low its going to be against Florida State and Deontay green starting lineup sorry Debbie for Georgia Tech we mentioned George and Dongo the two freshman sackos the third freshman Reeves the Florida transfer and they got to get Miles Kelly going yeah Miles Kelly in the last four games is two for 25 from the threepoint line and when you look at the shot selection its not poor just has got to start making some he might have to do some other things to get his engine going early George sends it inside its knocked Away by green and already we saw how Florida State likes to switch off those ball screens doesnt matter what position the defenders playing you really have to have a high defensive IQ to play for Leonard Hamilton CU you have to understand Personnel because they are going to switch one through five and Baba Miller number 11 in white he is their big guy on this matchup with Georgia Tech he has a chance to have a big game tonight and they have been waiting for Baba Miller to explode as you see a resume that speaks in the imperative belonging to Leonard Hamilton Kelly spots up and hits and Georgia Tech hoping that can unlock their leading score well if anyone needed to hit the first three and see a big basket that would be Miles Kelly B on what we gave you from a number standpoint had 21 when these two played in the ACC tournament last year Georgia Tech won that game on free throws in the waning seconds Millers first shot no good Dongo another rebound he played well at Diamond Head last two games in Hawaii averaged a double double entry pass sacko nearly had it stolen away warley got his hands on it and itll be a held ball possession arrow to Georgia Tech watch Miles Kelly Step into it gets his feet under his shoulders theres nothing wrong with his technique hes a hes got a beautiful looking jump shot hes just got to be a confident shooter it goes to Florida State damid stoutmire when we asked him about miles Kellys shooting slump he had a very NBA like approach he goes listen Im not going to over Coach him Im not going to tell him too many things he plays a lot of minutes hell figure it out and there was almost a calm and confidence and a trust that you saw from stout of meire with his young player I think when you are a shooter and you can selfcorrect and you have muscle memory and youre taking shots in the system and in the system it it requires space and read and react its not a lot of plays then you know youre going to find your way if you just stick with it and you put the time in and Miles Kelly does those things here comes warley the drive and kick now its Watkins splits the double block by Dango Reeves the other way Florida State Milling in Retreat and Reeves blocked at The Rim the follow by George rims out and we get a foul underneath against Georgia Tech you talk about long athletic and quick off your feet watch Dongo right here incredible recovery after he gets beat off the bouns doesnt give up on the play Dongo The Freshman already a threetime ACC rookie of the week hes been impressive right hes impressive in practice he was locked in today but he had a really good workout Morleys first threepoint attempt of the season goes he had largely sheld that shot this year and aaz basket brings the full court pressure in its mantoman defense that was the first field goal for Florida State the runner by Kelly did not go Watkins the rebound Miller calling for it Watkins to the rim offensive foul I mean we see Dongo on the backside of d block a shot now we draws a charge and transition this a terrific job by Dongo not to try to block the shot but to understand the difference between the timing of whether he has a chance to block it or draw a charge and make that kind of defensive play he had the big block at the end of the win against Duke Georgia Techs lone ACC win its lone ACC game a signature win for Damon stanmire that came against Duke Florida State in its only ACC game blew a 14 point second half lead to North Carolina Yellow Jackets almost turned it over and now they do sacko stepped out of bounds for Florida State this is game five on a seven game home stand last three games of this home stand all League games and Leonard Hamilton was honest with us theyre still figuring out the best permutations the best lineups its a team coming off an embarrassing loss Saturday to libum I mean they were down 21 and they did make it a one possession game they did have opportunities at the end but this man right here wasnt the guy taking shots late in the game and Darren Greens the guy to me right now with where they are and based on what you said hes the guy that should have the ball in his hands late one of the best threepoint Shooters in the ACC George puts it on the floor tough shot and the rebound snag by Applause warley itll be Georgia Tech ball as we get a whistle on the Baseline Darren Green can heat up he gets his first three of the game 39 on the season with no fees or minimums and no hes got the type of credentials that resonate and relate to anybody playing for him and certainly anybody hes recruiting I think its a home run for Georgia ATT in theres a great story in Slam Magazine about how he got into coaching he was working out at Rice Chris Del con now the ad at Texas was the ad at Rice he had just hired Ben Braun he said Damon you look like You be a coach one day Damon said he never thought of it but he started shadowing Ben brw went to recruiting meetings then next thing you know hes traveling on the road hes doing some scouting reports and then he just fell in love with it and he said I operate on field Im a players coach and uh thats the way I played and thats the way I want to coach my Music guys Music here is Taylor B Bowen hes been a spark plug off the bench for Florida State shot clock at three they got to put it up down to one I dont think he beat it it does not count they can look at it but it looked like it was after the horn that what you said about Damon star he told us there are certain principles philosophies that he has taken from the NBA that he plans to apply to the college game one of those was how he uses that fifth starter and almost a revolving door based on matchups not married to a certain lineup but being fluid in your rotations you know I heard Damon speak at a clinic in August Larry shy you know coach shy runs a clinic down there at the University of Florida and there were a couple of takeaways for me in listening to him one was he values screening okay he thinks thats really important he wants to push to get the ball reversal no walking the ball up the floor space is really important and they love to play through the short role because of the game is so fast now the schemes defensively he thinks that affects the space on the floor and he says his guys are really starting to get better at making decisions out of the short roll that was something that he was great at as a point guard guard B Bowens three is not there now one for 10 on the season from Deep Debo Coleman into the game for Georgia Tech Reeves Georgia Techs best threepoint shooter no good and yellow jackets have missed their last Music Applause six Music taon Claude picking up the foul transfer from Western Carolina where he led the socon in rebounding last year Hamilton getting a lot of guys in and out early thats a deep rotation that hes still trying to figure out one thing we do know is this right here Darren Green can shoot the ball well and B Bowen there on cleanup Duty and into the game for Florida State cam Corin second game back for him after missing time with a tow injury he gives them a physical presence down low we weve seen Deontay green now for about a month or so playing out of position at the five yeah I think at 610 you got to have a guy thats active and athletic and the way they defend because they switch on everything cam corn can guard on the perimeter Chandler Jackson over to Primo Spears Spears the transfer from Georgetown and DEP Paul he is capable of doing that he can get his own shot as well as anybody I think you want to see him be more of a facilitator get his teammates involved more you do and that decision I think was outstanding because you push in transition you create a mismatch right away and gapare was on him and he has a tough time guarding him on off the bounds a lot of bigs will have tough time guarding spars off the bounds down low there is Claude using that big frame of his 67230 Goldsboro North Carolina Spears again coming off his best game as a null and that loss to lipskin Jackson knocks it down the sophomore from Memphis I mean you set that screen and you take that Defender out that is a 15t jump shot that you should make probably 75 of the time Anish I like the analytics on that better odds than Lloyd Christmas there is kaasi Reeves now Debo Coleman knocks it down from 15 elbow elbow jumper back to back most teams like to run their offense through the middle third you drill that every day so that you get those shots and you get comfortable shooting those shots with multiple Applause reps Jackson going to work on Coleman spin cycle back iron rebound Debo Applause Music Coleman look at Primo spear D up Reeves too strong from the Baseline Spears had the rebound and then gets tripped by Claude and thats two fouls on Claude Florida state with a fivepoint lead inside 12 in the first half here in Tallahassee Primo Spears off the missm match and transition to the midrange and then the Finish Inside by Claud we got a good one play has arrived its the new year and Saturday on accn we have the first basketball triple header of the year on this network Virginia NC State starts with sof Virginia Tech coming here to take on Florida State and then Duke Notre Dame at 6 Eastern all that Saturday on accn I enjoy football I admit but man nothing beats conference play now were rolling right it almost feels like now the season has started out of dribbling by Spears almost turned it over Jackson back out to Primo launches the three off the top of the backboard knocked around new 20 Baba Miller the offensive board and he turns it over here comes Kyle Stans began his career at USC now in his fourth season at Georgia Tech he started for almost two seasons he and Coleman give you a lot of EXP off that and Coleman I like he is a combo guard who can really shoot it has some range they both have ACC experience what you need Jackson thought about the long three its not in a bad strategy to start the point guard first right and then you come with your veteran guys Jackson the three short rebound Kelly averaging six rebounds a game this year sturen nice move thats the Savvy veteran the put back not there by Dongo everything but the finish for stur it Jackson Another open three this time he Applause hits Florida State doing a nice job early knocking down three triples in the first 10 minutes of the game and thats the ball movement that has lacked for FSU this year thats how they have built their success multiple switching man man defense and ball movement turning down a good shot for a better one Spears gets that match up again in transition with a big on him because he pushes in transition and he creates that matchup and then it flattens the defense when you drive Baseline opens up the top of the floor its simple spacing but you got to play hard you got to cut hard you got to work hard you look at Florida State in their wins they assist on more than half their baskets in their losses 42 last couple of games that theyve lost their assist rate is below 30 and we get a foul on the floor in the corner its going to be on Miller when you have a bunch of new guys that are trying to figure it out and even as you mentioned earlier coach H told us trying to figure out ation like who plays well together its a puzzle you know hell figure it out he will cuz he always does how much of that is a symptom of just the era of college basketball with the transfer portal guys want to go to a place where they feel they can get theirs I think you want to go somewhere where you can get better exactly and theres a lot of ways that you can impact the game that dont have anything to do with scoring you know one of the things that Damon stoutamire will be evaluating bigs is on their first three steps you know are they staying connected on screens defensively you do they go to the glass how hard do you cut those things matter all those things are being evaluated not just your ability to score a refrain that weve heard from coach is so much development gets lost when you do transfer multiple times Im not playing here Ill go somewhere else youre not playing there you go somewhere else well now youre on your third school and you havent gotten a whole lot better right and those that stick and stay look at Deo Coleman and Kyle sturdivan theyre perfect examples for Georgia Tech right now Watkins forced that good defense by Kelly sturdivan pushing the break Kellys the trailer catch and release in and out tipped around and it comes to Spears Georgia Tech getting back Spears the runner to strong and we get a foul on Florida State Music Primo Spears gives them another set of jets Off the Bench right quickness understands defense can guard bigs but hes got to learn change Pace on the offensive line he will jir Watkins meanwhile picked up his second foul thats Florida States leading score and theyre going to get de DTE green with foul number Music Applause Music two the size on the floor would favor Florida state with this lineup usually does right yes they got to take advantage of it and they go big with Baba Miller guarding the inbounds jayen gainy former ivy league Defensive Player of the Year Brown in there as well Applause Kelly had it poked away recovers Nate George the Freshman Reeds from the corner not there Georgia Tech three for 16 now from the Music Applause field I love how Baba Miller rebounds and gets him in their transition game quickly Spears forces up offensive rebound gainy now the 611 Spaniard Miller to the basket and the throw down thust the Applause Music foul I think this could be Baba Millers night hes got the length hes got the size Advantage this was an incredible possession for him from the rebound on one end to to the rim on the other 10point Florida State lead under eight to play in the Music first Auto Owners insures your car because sometimes Florida state with a 10point lead Baba Miller at the line for a threepoint play a native of mayorca an island off the coast of Spain its where rapael Nadal the great tennis player is from and all we heard last year when Florida State got off to that Dreadful start they were one and N they struggled early on hey just wait until Baba Miller gets here this guy came to Tallahassee from Spain with so much hype so much hoop hes now a sophomore and were still waiting and I think its definitely worth the wait because I think its there you know he his decision to play with his national team affected his ability to be in the weight room and and to stay here in Tallahassee I think a summer here underneath the player development of Coach Hamilton will definitely help him and then offensively I mean hes hes definitely equipped defensively offensively I think he has a skill set that we havent seen yet and I think part of that is his teammates need to help bring that out of it yeah lard Hamilton told me that about a week or so ago he said once we start playing Team Basketball youre going to see Baba Miller bear the fruits of that hes long hes athletic he can defend he can pass as we get a whistle Florida state turns it over they stepped out of bounds and well part of that you wonder is he shying away from some contact the free throw numbers he missed a free throw there 12 of 29 below 40 in his Florida State Career at the stripe I I dont think I could sleep at night if I was shooting 40 you I know 40 free throws that its not even the same sport George launches see I dont like that decision youre shooting 19 from the floor you got no rebounders youre the best offensive rebounding team in the league run your offense and get to your spots and then crash the glass Miller great feed for gainy who draws the foul down low I mean from our seat B M Miller just Towers over everyone else on the floor this is a great pass inside to gainy I think gainy is still getting his footing having not played a lot of basketball in the last couple of years and it was a shooting foul on ibraim aako the Music Freshman all right Sunday big day of womens college basketball on AC CN Debbie number 13 Virginia Tech number three NC State where will you be watching this game from oh Ill be watching it thats for sure uh what a great matchup in rivalry that has become in the ACC and the league is loaded it is top to bottom the the best League this year it has the most ranked teams North Carolina recently fell out of the pole but NC state has gone from unranked to number three picked preseason number eight on the womens side in the ACC so West Mo once again has an incredible lineup of players that are really connected and playing well together Reeds the Baseline Drive and the finish with the foul thats how you improve your shot selection and your field goal percentage right here put an explanation point on it Reeves with a great take hes not made a three he does a great job of getting to the rim in transition second foul on Baba Miller who heads to the bench so Watkins green and Miller all have two fouls and Reeves its the free throw 85 on the Music season Music Tom house passing on the three Tom house is an excellent threepoint shooter warley dropping it off for kany regains control swatted away but theyll count the basket ging with that knee brace still with a little bit of a limb lost some probably some elevation still trying to figure out its vertical good call by the officials here is a twotime defensive player of the year in the ivy of brown Kelly lost the handle numbers for Florida State House to warley House gets the offensive rebound heres bold Bowen met by Coleman good Hustle by Tom house that was from Deep Applause George accelerates the other way Coleman lines it up to strong battle for the board and right now Florida States not giving up many offensive rebounds to Georgia Tech theyve done a good job even when theyre switching manto man theyre making sure they get a body on somebody house the contested Applause three Tom house has made eight triples in one twopoint basket this season so you got to know the Scout on that young Music Applause man largest lead of the game for Florida State George contested and he hits you can tell they like this freshman they think hes going to be a good one at a program thats got a history of producing not good but great point guards being coached by a great point Dango comes out to meet Applause green Bley driving on George too much extra pass Reeves lines up the three offensive rebound George comes to Dongo good ball movement Kelly passed on the shot bu Bowen with the recovery Coleman now and the put back for Dongo plus one five offensive rebounding rebounds excuse me for Georgia Tech the best offensive rebounding team in the Music ACC Coleman and Dongo with the follow thats why you move the ball in you get teams rotated get him a half pass late and then you have a lane to the ring to offensive rebound now we were just saying how Florida state had done a nice job on the defensive Blass and Georgia Tech had a couple of extra opportunities on that possession and Dongo completes the threepoint play his last four games Debbie he is 28 of 33 from the field impressive love for cam borin let get Music Jackson picking up Applause Sturman Dongo gets it down low a big size advantage on green skip past to Reeds looking for help tipped Away by Jackson shot clock at two down to one stur the prayer that was online Spears over to Green that better pass to Darren Green and that shots going up extra pass it comes to Spears who left it way short but Leonard Hamilton will take that kind of ball mve hell definitely take that ball movement hell love to push up the floor and uh hell like this one too cam Corin with a stuff Applause Music ready for a Leonard Hamilton coach team theyre going to be deep and theyre going to be tall look at the size right here and these guys switch one through five and guard on the perimeter thats incredible length the other constant is they play hard you know that is a given and youve won fifth alltime career ACC wins 410 uh Hall of Fame resume for Leonard Hamilton incredible Ambassador and gentleman for the game with a great story for how many young men hes helped become better people pioneer in so many ways and now with both Jim beheim and Mike Bray no longer at Syracuse to den Notre Dame respectively Leonard Hamilton is the long EST tenur head coach currently in the ACC George is fouled you think of the coaching changes these last few years with beheim Bray Roy Williams Mike Shashi go back further Rick patino how the Old Guard in the ACC has changed its now Leonard Hamilton and Jim Lena and Tony Bennett Brad Brownell is part of that now what an incredible job Clemson how about that game tonight later on tips off at 800 Clemson playing at Miami the pieces seemed to fit real well they struck gold with Joe Gerard in the transfer portal I always have felt graad brs unheralded and I think people say that so much that hes got to be sit hearing it I mean they have been successful they have won DJ Hall is a potential Player of the Year candidate hes a leading candidate for that along with I would say RJ Davis right now in North Carolina rebounds on Music Claude Jackson hes given this team a nice spark Off the Applause Music Bench this is a high motor team right you have to bring energy High hands on the catch youve got to be locked in youve got to communicate all switch you got to be able to guard inside you got to be a guard on the perimeter you got to bring it when you play for Leonard Hamilton Reeves against Green terrific defense Reeves able to get it back Kelly spins it to George over Corin and a foul on the battle for the Music board spe picks up his first Music Applause foul I think the switching mantoman defense and the disrupt ability of Florida States D has caused some Havoc a little bit for Georgia Tech Damon Stout told us today hes not a guy that runs a lot of plays they like to operate in space a read and react sort of offense hes got enough guards they can make plays off the bounds but I think theyve been bothered by that length that we were speaking of young team too remember two freshmen have been starting the last several games they started three freshman tonight with sacko making his first career start theres Spears with the pullup left it short we asked hand about Primo Spears and some of the shot selection he said every team hes been on hes been the leading scorer hes got to learn he can do other things to help us lot of dribbling from the corner the three no good by Tara gari the UMass Music Applause transfer Kelly has been kind of quiet here in this one he did hit his first shot attempt hes been patient has not forced it today cor nearly stole it away kapari splits the D down the lane through the Tallahassee traffic Shooters in the corner cant pinch down the lane line nice finish he had a 20point game the last month against Penn State B bow and the runner they think hes got a chance to be good hes raw he is athletic tons of potential he was one of the first names coach Hamilton brought up to us today at shoot around somebody who could emerge here in conference play You been seeing double dig double digit minutes of late final 40 seconds first half h b and guarding Dongo kicked away pour in the steel about a 2 second to differential between game clock and shot Applause clock Im looking for Darren Green number 22 right here we go one4 low and flatten it up expect a flat ball screen coming out sprinting out here here it comes shot clock down to Bob here comes Spears against gabari Spears down the lane tough Runner the tip in by Corin goes as the first half expires guard now Watkins Florida States top Music scorer comes out to Baba Miller offensive rebound warley the put back and a rebound by Dongo what is the path back for Georgia Tech besides the obvious theyve got to make more shots well I think ball movement is the key right in recognizing mismatches I thought in their Nevada game late in the game they didnt do a very good job of doing that I think thats an adjustment here in the second half for Damon Stout Meers team in the first half eight for 30 from the field and one of 14 from downtown its not a good shooting team to begin with one of the few games they really did shoot it well from the field was that win against Duke but they rely on hustle points they rely on crashing the offensive glass and but creating more opportunities thats allowed them to get out to an eight and4 start the other thing too is get to the free throw line when youre struggling to score put some pressure on that back row and thats a great take off the Bounce by reevs whos been able to attack the Baseline a couple of times tonight hes got five two of eight from the field he and Miles Kelly the only yellow jackets with multiple field Applause goals orley hit his first three of the Season today his first threepoint attempt as well green on the Baseline Drive kicks it out to Miller shot clock down to three warley turbines inside blocked Away by Reeds dangos the trailer lob inside Dongo through a triple team Music fouled Reeves does a good job of using the rim to Shield the D and the shot blocker finishing on the other side you can sense a a little bit of urgency by Georgia Tech out of the locker room right theyve bued their Cadence on the offensive end getting to the free throw line really important for them here to dig back in meanwhile jir Watkins picked up his third Applause foul Watkins without a bucket in the game the leading scorer from Florida State so thats again another Point towards their bench play and seals have been able to weather that Dongo 70 free throw shooter coming into the game gets one out of two the originally committed to ruter was recruited there by Carl Hobs one of Damon statamire assistance now and when Hobs joined Stam staff he was able to convince Dongo to say no to Piscataway and come to Atlanta green with a smooth jumper the sophore out of Asheville North Carolina green went for The Applause Intercept being disrupted making it hard to get the ball in bounds taking you out of your Rhythm Kelly amidst the trees and you can tell just the side the length the arms your vision gets blurred up against this Florida State Defense its not just turning you over as green knocks down the face off jumper it is speeding you up to a point where youre uncomfortable Jackson at seven points in the first half to lead Florida State they get a foul away from the ball its on sacko Sako his second Music think they want to take a look at this one the other thing they might be looking at is to make sure that the the basket wouldnt score by Darren Green that the in the act of shooting and simultaneously having the foul off the ball so theres a couple of things I believe the officials are taking a lead look at thats the shot by Darren Green but off the ball you see right here the little T the tie up does the foul happen before the shot thats what I think theyre looking at I thought I heard the whistle before the shot you know you see it then you blow the whistle so there is that delay and that does matter I think the officials do a good job of coming together here theyre going to explain it I think that basket by Darren Green based on their conversation that might count then you want to make sure you have the right well its not a shooting foul on the on the uh on the foul well get the explanation from Matt pter yeah so youre right Debbie the basket does count I think thats a good piece of officiating right there to come together and get it right again you pick that up we green is in the act of shooting thats Applause Music right its could be a fivepoint play Josh nickelberry 20 in white into the game for the Music NES Hamilton has used 12 players Jackson has nine one off a career high gets the steel this might turn into a longer possession nickelberry down the lane and hes fouled I saw a fist pump out of Leonard Hamilton over there on the sideline Jackson with a tough two right Applause here and look at the bench guys are are locked in thats the green team down there if youve ever been to a Leonard Hamilton Scout or practice those guys bring it every day they were given the starters and the second team a run for their money this afternoon they always do Isaac spainhower right there hes the veteran guy on that green team now red shirt junor so you start with the green basket then the foul foul from the basket by Jackson to Steel that turns into what five points on that trip down the floor for Florida Music State 70 run by the N Dongo whips it off the hands of kasas reeds oasy Applause Music reads a minus three and a half turnover margin for Georgia Tech but they usually make up for it on the glass PARTA State plus three on the glass so far the seminal have one more offensive rebound Georgia Tech the best offensive rebounding team in the league warley the runner Here Comes Applause George nice move there by the Freshman from Toronto he is going to be a really good point guard in this league hes got all the skill hes got speed pretty good decision maker at that high rate of speed hes becoming a a more of a a threat offensively Deonte green missfires Applause Miles Kelly get going takes it strong to the 10 and hes got seven backto back layups by Georgia Tech its something Damon statam preached against Florida State get down floor beat them before they can set up the defense be careful about that spin move in the middle third green turns it Applause over 611 Miller guarding George Dongo was setting the screen Miller able to draw the foul Miller called for the foul on George is Applause Music third you got a tilt the floor you got to get downhill you got to attack that full court pressure and theyve done that here in the second half backto back hoops George and Tech trying to make a run tan bomb weekdays from marks Charlotte Studio basement comes your way at for Eastern College Football Conference play and college basketball you got the spring sports starting up soon mens and womens lacrosse college baseball college softball its all around the corner as we wrap up the college football season here next Music Applause Music week Georgia Tech does have three baskets here to start the second half and all of them have been at The Music Rim heres Primo Music Spears hes done a really nice job closing out on Darren Green tonight the shooter the Florida state not giving him a lot of good Music Applause looks

you beat that first wave of pressure youve got to score and theres a a warning issued to Georgia Tech not to touch the ball through the net little foot fake create some separation to get into the rhythm of your Music jumper Spears over Coleman its good and right now Georgia Tech offensively theyve got two ball handlers in the game game Stan and Nathan Music Music George look how far Florida States pushing Georgia Tech away from the bucket they cant even make an entry pass yet were already at 10 on the shot late offense sturen inside Dongo the turnaround theres that nice short roll getting to the space making a play over that left shoulder lob hit the backboard six points eight boards for Dongo George through the contact gets two free throws Primo dribbles into a switch right here gets a little separation uses that last bounce to power himself into the elevation of his jump shot and then a nice finish by Dongo whos been quiet tonight for Georgia Tech mediate timeout 1344 to go second half Florida stayed up by a Bakers Dozen if you love my broadcast partner Debbie Antonelli made it a point to meet with Darren Greens family in particular you wanted to meet sister Dal and youve got a very good reason well Dal is the 13yearold sister of Darren and she has Down syndrome and people that know our story know that um I have my son Frankie who has Down syndrome and prior to getting here I received a handwritten note from Darren through the great Chuck Walsh obviously of Florida State saying he was looking forward to meeting me and wanted or wanted me to meet his sister and we have talked about his sister many times uh Darren is an inspiration to DAL and Dal is an inspiration to Darren Darren says he talks to before every game she told him tonight to have fun and make some threes and uh getting a chance to meet Darren senior and nah and Darrens U other sister di what a great family and one day dalen is going to be able to go to the Clemson Life program because Clemson offers a program for students that have intellectual disab ability its an incredible postsecondary experience and uh my son Frankie graduated from Clemson and is living at Clemson independently with support and having great success with his couple of jobs so kudos to Clemson life for sharing the good word and uh I want to thank Darren for making it a point that I got a chance to meet D shes awesome Im so glad you did and Ive had the chance to meet your son Frankie on a couple of occasions what a terrific young man to see you beam with Pride telling his story and even earlier today were talking to shoot around and youre talking about Frankie going to work and making sure hes got his hat he hunged up the phone on you cuz he didnt want to hear about the Hat it was a little chilly and clips this morning I said are you wearing your winter hat it was like Applause click but thats thats the um you know the ACC has some really good stories around it you know Amari Robinsons a player at Clemson she has a sister with Down syndrome and then of course theres you know Virginia texts Elizabeth kitley great sister Raven theres a wonderful story about Raven who is living uh with autism so theres some really inspiring stories around the leag No Doubt Watkins from the outside hits the three Florida state has made its last five shots the lead is Applause 14 they just make everything challenging Florida State high hands on the catch and theyve done this pretty much without fouling I mean thats a foul 90 ft away from the bucket but for the most part Leonard Hamiltons teams been locked in on this end of the floor making it really challenging for Georgia Tech to get any rhythm going offensively and when you can go 11 deep foul trouble isnt the concern it is for teams that only go six or seven deep Miles Kelly today three of seven hes got seven points Watkins with three fouls guarding him closely Kelly trying to go over a double team batted around and jir Watkins has Applause it 3 second violation they get Cam Applause corn Music Applause Music Watkins out to meet Music Applause Music Stant shot Lo into single digits Kelly driving on green contested Runner Georgia Tech looked like it had the offensive rebound and it goes out of bounds on Claude Florida State ball its been the bench today for the seals 31 points off the pine 11 different seals have made a Music basket Florida State maintaining that double digit lead here in the second half they move the ball theyre getting into space theyre knocking down triples theyve got six threes in this game by five different players and theyve moved the ball well nine assists on 20 made baskets which we know we talked about in the first half Anish is an important number for Florida State on the the offensive end and Georgia Tech since making its first three has not only missed 14 straight they have not even attempted one in the second half Jackson thats going to be a goal tend and a career high 11 points now for Chandler Music Applause Jackson and now Florida state will make you work and this is what they can do to shrink the game in a lot of ways by the time you get into your offense the shot Fox already down to 15 at times I think were seeing a little possession of Zone here out of Florida State they didnt work on it and ironically you go Zone and what does Miles Kelly do bust a triple first three of the second half first three after 14 misses for Georgia Tech coach ham digging into his bag in the second half Baba Millers answer not there well when we saw them practice The Zone during shoot around the Green Team now the wons they knock down a few threes too they only lasted one possession of that and Coleman knocks down a three and I dont think youre going to see this Zone much Applause longer Florida state is led by as many as 17 Spears turns it over Kelly hits the turbo button and its an eightpoint Applause game three consecutive scores and poor decision making on Florida States Applause end ABA Miller it ribs out Corin there for the follow Florida State fans might be having someday Jau in the loss to Georgia in the ACC SEC challenge Florida State blew a 17point halftime lead against North Carolina they blew a 14point halftime lead 14point second half lead really those were second half leads Kelly misfires battle for the board knocked out of bounds last touch Music Claud get the line number one Music Applause Music war Florida States got to come down here and they cant have an empty possession for momentum reasons they got to move the ball side to side so then they can get back into their full court pressure Jackson out of control turns it over you dont have to make the play yourself every time down the floor you can get others involved the one thing that Florida State doesnt have this year which MJ Walker and other point guards have done is get a piece of the paint and kick right now when they drive to the paint theyre driving to score theyre not looking to set anyone else Applause Music up Kelly gets past Watkins hangs in the air the tip by Dongo no and Watkins will be fouled theyll get S of it its actually not a bad foul just 14 fouls you want to go against your set defense one of the things coach stau told told us is you know we dont want live ball turnovers against these guys we want to make them play against our set D Miller posting up swivels in for two see when they score the difference about their pressure Nish is they can get a guy on the ball you know and that really helps them set their defense and allows them to you know make it difficult to get the ball in bounds even more challenging stur ofan down the lane and hes able to draw the foul Two Shots coming and as much as the Florida State Defense is a highrisk high reward you you only gamble if you know youre going to get it right you have to have a little more discipline there you want to stay up the line and intense but a little discipline will keep you from forcing rotation on the back side especially when youve got a double digit Music Applause lead stent is the lone Georgia Tech player left from that 2021 ACC Championship team started almost 50 games the last two seasons and he givs Damon statamire a valuable experienced piece off the Music bench after going two for four from the free throw line in the first half now Georgia Tech has done a much much better job six for eight so they are chipping away Corin through the contact it comes to Coleman who secures George up ahead Dongo into the corner Reeves good ball movement George for three front rim rebound to cam Corin yeah I I think Deo Coleman to probably ball fake that and shot it himself hes a better threepoint shooter Watkins a foul on Dongo and a chance at a threepoint Applause Music play 12 points Florida State lead after not scoring in the first half Watkins coming alive here in the second for Florida State Music youll never guess what were doing whats changed offensively for Georgia Tech in the second half well I think theyve played downhill a lot better theyve been able to get in the paint theyve been aggressive at attacking the rim theyre attacking the pressure theyve made a couple of Threes here lately that have given them some momentum but I also think theyre recognizing the mismatches that Florida state with their switching manto man and doing a better job of getting the right people taking shots Jamir Watkins at the free throw line for Florida State all nine of his points have come here in the second half for of VCU Ram who helped his old team to the NCAA tournament last year you got to be strong with the ball right here for Georgia Tech and you got to cut hard to get open Miller picking up up George now Dongo on the logo puts it on the floor blocked out of bounds well get a foul on Corin this is the aggressiveness Im talking about recognizing a mismatch dangos been kind of quiet for his numbers tonight this is a great recognition by the freshman and and a hard take off the Music bounce and he has emerged as one of the top freshman in the ACC and tonight like you said its been a relatively quiet night for him and he still got a good chance to get another double double eight points eight rebounds right now against a taller front line which is something hes going to see every night in the Applause ACC nine points for by Dango whos coming off backto back 20point games the seminal lead is a Music dozen Watkins for three rebound batted in the air Dongo is there his ninth board and here comes stens strong to the 10 puts it up and gets rewarded with two shots another trip to the free throw line for Georgia Tech exactly what you want stop the clock get to the line now you got to make Music them Darren Green picks up his second foul Georgia Tech N9 of 14 at the stripe as a Music team stent came into the game 21 out of 24 on the season tomorrow night at 10 Eastern after our womens basketball double header the nothing but net crew will break down tonight in the ACC highlights and Analysis of every womans game and a look ahead to some of the best matchups this weekend including a pretty big one between Virginia Tech and NC State well tomorrow night Florida State on the road at NC State NC State number three in the country and Muffet Kelsey Ivory and Kelly will break it all down tomorrow Applause Music night Miller gets the entry pass and puts it in for two hes got six full court pressure what does this do to a team over the course of a game its a physically and mentally and emotionally draining knowing you got to manage under duress for 94 ft thats for sure because its a Relentless effort it doesnt back off based on substitution you got to stick with it George no good on the three yellow jackets three of 19 from downtown Watkins lost it thats a great hustle play by George Reeves drives beats Corin and the foul the first half Florida States pressure was relentless without fouling the second half Georgia Tech has been much more aggressive in their mindset they are looking to get to the paint theyre forcing the ISS isue on the back row of the defense in switches theyve done a much better job here attacking oi Reeds cannot complete the threepoint play former top 100 recruits who spent two seasons in Florida lead is Music Applause 11 Watkins calls for the screen doesnt get it shot clock down to five warley underneath puts in the tear drop how did that go in wow he was almost parallel with the Applause Music Music ground Kelly over Corin 14 for Miles Kelly to lead all scores he has not stopped working without the ball Ive been impressed with Miles Kelly tonight oh Baba Miller little show and Applause Teller Baba Miller takes his game to the block thats backto back buckets for him inside a glimpse of the tantalizing potential in his 11 frame Reeves knocks down the three Yellow Jackets not going Music away if they can get it to a two possession game then you put some serious game pressure on Florida State and Darren Green junr Applause responds Reeves hits the three youve got to locate kaasi Reeds backto back triples I thought fatigue played a little bit of a factor in the last two transitional defensive efforts by Florida State late on the close out late in transition find that man hes Music hot kaasi reads the Florida transfer couple of Threes to bring Georgia Tech within nine statistically hes been this teams best threepoint shooter this season well you have to find him right now in the open floor I mean he started the game attacking he had a couple of buckets attacking the Baseline hes been good off the bounce hes showing more than just being a threepoint threat but after going one for 14 in the first half from three Music Georgia Tech is four for their last seven shooting 65 overall in the second half Primo Spears back in there for Florida sting after shooting 28 in the first Music Applause half Aaron Green Way Off Kelly down the lane and two shots coming George attack in attack mode going to the basket and down underneath the basket near the photographers well is Miles Kelly he went hard into the stands got to remember this is a team that is already without out Lance Terry who was the number two scorer a season ago and Terry and Kelly were seem now they were seem to be the the top two scoring options Lance got hurt Lance Terry did decided to red shirt preserve the year of Applause Eligibility I I dont know if they have to sub them out because Damon stoutmire came on the flooor someone else shoots the free throws Kelly looks to be okay A little Grimace in the Huddle so I I believe what happens here is because Damon stoutmire came on the court he does have to be subbed out and then Florida State picks from the remaining four on the floor who would shoot the free throws Music Music so Kelly heading back to the Music bench and theyre going to say gari whos only six of 11 entering play today and a career 57 free throw Music shooter Music Music Music Applause you have to be ready to rebound right here if youre Florida state Georgia Tech is looking to tap it back missed them both and they might get over the back on Dongo they Applause Music Applause do and Miles Kelly will come back in as Nathan George exits a little bit of a limp Music Music Music KY sets the high screen Spears tough shot and he hits wow thats a big basket Primo in prime time hes not afraid thats for sure Reeves Catch and Release but then they make a mistake on the backside of Applause pressure thats one of the reasons why Leonard Hamilton doesnt like to trap he likes to switch he doesnt want to put two on the Applause ball and we get a foul it is away from the ball on Miles Kelly Primo is not shy about calling his own number he gets a wide open look and he buries it and then two on the ball at the front of the pressure allows Reeves to get backside for his third triple in transition here in the last couple of minutes 16 points to lead all scores for kaasi Reeves Chandler Jackson careerhigh 11 points tonight make it Applause 12 both teams are in the bonus next foul against Florida State puts Georgia Tech in the double bonus you got out by rebound Reb Sub in so you can set D see after made free throws Florida States been up on the ball here you see they back up a little bit because of that backside threepoint Music shooting George picked up by gainy on the switch and we get a foul its going to be four on Watkins that is Dongo doing a great job of rolling hard keeping the seal burying Watkins in the rim and thats knowing youve got the mismatch thats Music Applause right Applause Music Saturday on ACCC Network its a triple header Virginia well take on NC State Florida State plays host of Virginia Tech and then finally number 14 Duke and Notre Dame Square Off in South Bend blue doubles had a win against Syracuse last night one out of two for Dongo here its a ninepoint game l than three minutes to play seminal get it in bounds Here Comes full court pressure by Tech Spears drives dishes Watkins stepped out of bounds thats the second time Florida State and running the floor hard and wide has stepped out of bounds before the Music catch this is the game pressure I was talking about you cant have slippage here right now if youre Florida State you got to stay locked in Georgia Tech you keep attacking keep getting to the free throw line Georgia Tech five of eight from three in the second half Reeves has had the hot hand green pokes it away itll stay with the rambling Music wreck the 611 Baba Miller will guard the inbounder this is a really tough spot you got to cut hard inside to Dongo almost lost it Dany pokes it away Dongo the three air Applause ball I would consider fouling Baba Miller the second he touches the ball sub 50 free throw shooter for his career Spears a very good free throw shooter hell bleed some clock shot clock at four at three green hits the three how about Primo Spears getting it up right in the shooting pocket a perfect pass Reeves dips underneath gets his own Miss puts it in for two hes got 18 and Debbie that last play may have represented a real growth moment for Primo Spears in this offense shot clock winding down instead of taking it he makes the pass and Darren Green splashes it Music in youre telling me one man did this 10point lead for Flor State and ishra Debbie Antonelli shot clock running down Primo Spears makes the pass all night he has been downhill downhill late clock and you see a little pinch off the corner to give Darren Green enough room and theres his family celebrating just like dalen asked have fun and make some threes and boy did he make a big one right here with 140 to play when you watch Florida State its easy to see if they can figure out sharing the basketball theres probably no bigger recipient of that than Darren Green who is one of the best Sharpshooters in the country as Georgia Tech commits the foul hes a fantastic catch and shoot hes also very good at creating separation one of the top threepoint Shooters in the nation hes made coming into the game his career is over 330 now hes got 333 three and 34 threes for his career its impressive seventh in the nation Joe Gerard he and Joe Gerard got a little battle going at at Clem so we got to keep an eye on Music that Watkins gets the front end of the one and one now how long do you leave Baba Miller in the game knowing that Georgia Techs going to want a foul you probably want to leave him in for defense dont you I think for a defensive possession yes but I think he might might be coming out no hes going to leave him in and take cor out you need him to protect the rim its a 12point lead Reeves has had the hot hand hes got 18 not this time forced that one and Dongo knocked it away out of Music Applause bounds last couple of Threes there by Georgia Tech Dongo I think had more time on that previous possession on the shot clock than he thought Reeves hoisted it up full court pressure by Georgia Tech they got Jackson they got Spears and Watkins all can handle and Florida State breaks the Press double triple with four guards on the Music floor its a couple of turnovers here late for Watkins he stepped out of bounds a few moments prior B point game Georgia Tech Running Out of Music Time stent and Kelly draws the foul two shots for Music Music him Music Applause Music Applause following our game here on accn weve got NC State of Notre Dame West and Dan B will have the call Irish 51 from the field and that win against Virginia and state coming off with a couple of nonconference wins we got Marcus Burton whos the reigning ACC rookie of the week for Notre Dame as Reeds commits the foul Spears a terrific free throw shooter with a one and Music one still early in conference play assuming Florida State holds on here what do you take away from tonight well I think coach Hamilton is figuring out some of those rotations he was he was working through and I think its so important that they have multiple ways that they can attack you on both ends of the floor for Georgia Tech I think its just a matter of moving the ball playing in space like Damon sire wants and I mean Miles Kelly coming back to life offensively right they needed him to be able to shoot the ball well Florida State having trouble get it in they finally do its kicked 18 points for Kelly who had been shooting below 35 on the season entering play this is a guy who thought about going pro after last year well Ill tell you the thing that I was most impressed with with Miles Kelly was his work off the ball his acceleration to space his movement to get open I thought that was impressive and definitely something for him to build Music on Florida State less than a minute from victory in an ACC game after losing at home to libum over the weekend seals conclude their seven game home stand with Virginia Tech and then Wake Forest I tell you what Debbie Wake Forest is a team they look like a sweet 16 team right now Im telling you Im high on Wake Forest you know when you can add Fon Reed to give you three levels of Defense you got good ball pressure you have the ability to rotate but when you have Rim protection that gives you that third level it changes your scheming defensively in terms of your ball screen coverage it opens up the floor because he runs hes 71 he runs he screens hes wide he rebounds it gets you in transition theres a lot of pieces that come together and Steve forb certainly knows how to put a back court as scoring backourt together now Reed has raised the ceiling of the entire season the Gonzaga transfer Jackson fouled by Sturdivant and hes got two shots coming to put a button on Wake Forest Hunter Salis and bopy Miller are the two guards in the back court theyre the only team in the ACCC with two in the top 10 in scoring theyre combining for over 35 points they really play well in transition in space and they can break off the offense any time then you got a cam hildr whos one of those ultimate blue guys that winning teams have hes a winning player hes going to make a winning play Parker Fred comes off the bench and can shoot it I mean theres a lot of pieces Zack Keller has gotten much better inside how about what Chandler Jackson is given Florida State Off the Bench tonight 13 points really solid I thought he made some really good decisions I thought his pressure defensively was an issue hes got great quickness you stay stay Applause stay defense for offense substitution as Miller comes in for Jackson a little more size on the back end and Florida State even with the lead even in the final minute staying with the Press its who they are its what they do stent against warley Music 7669 I mean theyre theyre get a turnover here they a couple of Miss free throws got a chance to trap right here time out timeout called dont want to catch it in that Music corner final timeout for Florida State both teams in the double bonus setal of lead pretty much most of the way Florida State led by as many as 17 in in the second half they led by 13 at halftime Georgia Tech really struggled horrendous first half shooting the basketball theyve been terrific in the field in the second half 17 of 28 in the second half 6 of 11 from three in the second half after going one for 14 from three in the first 20 minutes I mean this is not Music over Georgia Tech home for Boston College this weekend and then Notre Dame for a couple of big road tests at Duke into Music Clemson Spears up ahead to warley and they foul him him career 67 free throw shooter y this gets interesting right so now you got to be prepared to block out Georgia Tech has to secure the rebound and Advance the ball quickly the sevenpoint lead this is as close as Georgia Tech has been in the second half Applause Lees a guy of late hes had a scrap for his minutes only played 11 minutes a season low last time out youve got other guards on this team who are showing what they can do Jackson we know about Primo Spears makes the two big free throws you got to know he has that little hitch in his free throw so you dont jump with a lane violation Miles Kelly accelerates lost it and gives it up thats a good defensive effort by Darren Green he got a Music Music deflection baseball pass to warley makes the catch and the Applause exclamation Reeves off Applause Target and that should do it they roll foul Spears I thought the Darren green three was going to be the one that created the final separation but that pass over the top you cant get feet long this is a great pass right here over the shoulder how about warley making a couple of free throws and finishing the game and the baseball pass thrown by Jackson yet another winning play by the sophomore from Applause Memphis Applause hes played the best game of his young career tonight 14 points a career high had a big steal on the Baseline couple of Music assists Kelly is fouled on the shot I mean coach Hamilton cant even look good film tomorrow itll look good in film West D and Dan boner standing by for NC State and Notre Dame thats next here on ACN Isnt it nice St conference Hoops back in thats great I know we have those oneoffs in November December I dont count that its good to be with you too Anish Applause likewise baby Applause Music Watkins dribbles out the clock and Florida state gets its first ACC win of the season they LED pretty much wire to wire in this one they shrug off an embarrassing loss to libum over the weekend and get a double digit win
