jacket for U ofl and a CG honoring Clinton Glass classmate of M at s x who died earlier this year that former a Bellman booster as were ready to go here as JJ trainer wins the tip and here is sky Clark three cards scored in double figures in the last game skot clar coming off a 29o effort you see JJ trainer in the starting lineup after his 209 rebound effort on Saturday against the agies yeah trainer gets a start Dennis Evans only played three minutes against the agies as Louisville gets a corner three for mik James to start him off Trey white little ball movement early on couple extra passes and Mike James gets a bucket for three kind of good to get him going lets take a look at the starting 54 Bell and we see Alec freem Peter Suter Garrett Tipton bash wheelen and LT Hatton langon Hatton LT from North Harrison High School and James Madison and the cards as Brandon Huntley Hatfield has it in the post who should see them going inside to him quite a bit but frame knocks it away and it goes off of Huntley halfi Trey white sky Clark Mike James Brandon hutley atfield and JJ trainer Dennis Evans has been in that lineup most of the Year Jody but he only played a few minutes on Saturday but the main thing for the cards is good to see Mike James had been one for 10 from three in his last four games he had been doing other things to affect the game not scoring not shooting it well and he said he just got to continue to do it he had been doing some extra work and uh we talked to him yesterday and uh it paid off right there from the beginning its a bellerin team thats going to be very patient theyre going to make the extra pass a lot of times work the shot clock down as we see it there and a bucket into the lane for TI tip you got to be disciplined on defense against this team as we saw last year and and Scotty dports teams known for that Garrett Tipton coming off of a monster effort last year here in this game 21 points in that 6766 win that was a strange game a game where bell didnt score for the the last four plus minutes but still able to hold on for the one one point win wheel inside has it knocked Away by clar yeah I remember in that game out scor 11 nothing is uh we so we see the threepointer here nice job by Trey white getting the ball to the open James in the corner James had that 25o effort in the first game and look at that in the last three just 15 total points three for n teams on the field so that had uh been a talking point getting him going and he hit the early three once again deep into the shot clock its going to be like this all night off the back of the rim and here comes sky clock pushing it off the cards we know they like to draw fouls yeah they do its been the best thing theyve done so far especially in the last game they shot 49 free throws against New Mexico state and that time a little miscommunication sky Clark thinking Trey white was cutting to the basket instead he went to the corner and a turnover there for Music Applause Music Louisville SC to tipon Tipton the riip through and he goes Baseline on James and a and a quick foul on Mike James his first and the team first here in the early going again every time bellerin has the ball youre going to see extra pass a lot of back door a lot of to the basket like that just right there with the recovery there fake and cut Lille gets it Clark out on the Applause break trainer with the air ball from the Baseline hatting the rebound for Bellin if Bellin finds a matchup they like they will take advantage of it and Tipton showed us last year hes able to drive to the basket and score in the Music paint and he can also hit for three there you go good ball Movement by bman theyre always going to look and try to get the easy shot that one an open look for Tipton they are playing shorthanded tonight without Ben Johnson fantastic threepoint shooter B in this uh program in its fourth year as theyre transitioning to division one James with a misson frame the rebound they really go through the gauntlet early in the season a Suter gets all the way to the basket Easy 2 and it is 73 nights in the early going so disciplined so take it to the basket kind of kind of lull the defense to sleep a little bit on the drive and then just accelerate and go right by for Suter a very very good job offensively nice come in here two and five but theyve only played two home games this season as bash reel comes up and already played at Washington at C Kansas State at West Virginia as I said that fourpoint loss on Sunday frame Baseline to hat gets it inside has his shot blocked by Applause trainer Clark in the corner a lot of times Louisville as weve seen early in other games settling for a couple threes and taking some quick shots here early on CS is one for five from the field in the early going Suter inside misses overt trainer that looked like cat Huntley Hatfield knocked it out but its going to be Louisville ball Mike James started it off for Lille with a threepointer from the corner its the only bucket the cards have made though Beller a three from Tipton theyve got a 73 Music lead back here in the kfcm center B on a 70 run the cars in a 4minute scoring drought and the Knights came in here last year last November November 9th and got their first win ever Over Louisville in 13 games you see Garrett Tipton had 21 points and three rebounds and that Mike Mike James had 16 for UFL get this bellerin players current bellerin players scored 56 of their 67 points in that game um now thats including Ben Johnson whos not playing tonight current UFL players only scored 30 so Louisville with couple new pieces here and they hope that will be the difference but so far its 7 three nights in the early going couple of new pieces out there for Beller again an offensive foul on Louisville Huntley Hatfield again on the moving screen a couple of new pieces out there Billy Smith and Desmond McKenna in the game for Beller they do not have Ben Johnson as we said 13 points a game uh he was injured Sunday at West Virginia 13 points hes 16 of 40 from threepoint range guys with four turnovers in the early going Smith and mckenny both transfers from mckenny from North Dakota State and Smith from Indianapolis Ruff play for Todd Howard and Indianapolis Ruff and a transfer from Miami of Ohio which as Jody as you knows the Harvard of the Midwest he misses the air ball on the three tra Huntley Hatfield there for the rebound white makes a little move shot up and good for Trey white and thats again for those of you just maybe watching Lille the first time transfer from USC and thats his game the pullup game is so good at it and when hes got it going he is tough to stop Tipton comes up with the loose ball after the Wheeling drive back to Tipton out front to M Kenny to suder with under 10 on the shot clock Suter driving on white loses the ball in the lane cars with a chance to tie or take the lead with a three Clark hes got to Wi he passes up the three to get into DET trainer with Tipton on him passes up another three and James is going to get a wide open three misses that one white with the rebound at the next dead ball well get Dennis Evans and Tyler Johnson in for Louisville and and the the Louisville offense seems to run a lot smoother with Johnson on the court as weve seen in the last couple games it really does Louisville now two of eight with four turnovers here tell you what this watch bman and watch chipon away from the ball tipon is number 10 he moves as well as anybody away from the ball like turnaround jumper there from Wheel in the hook shot but uh thats what makes Beller so good is the movement without the ball and if you watch Tipton number 10 hes always always moving and that gets him a lot of of of those easy shots 10 on the shot clock for Louisville just the two field goals in the early one James to the basket the lefthanded shot goes there so James struggled over the last three games shooting the ball hes got five here in the early going McKenna Scotty dport says Dez McKenna is the quickest player hes ever had said Dylan pen he had a couple years ago who ended up transferring to Vermont and playing in the NCA tournament last year was the fastest but McKenna is the quickest coming back from a NE injury last year at North Dakota State Clark will try the three and got it and the Cs are back in front 109 give that to Trey white both on the defensive end getting a hand at the face and recovering at the last minute to force a three Off the Mark and then got the ball out and he drew the defense to him and then Clark open for the three big assist 72 run for Louisville and deflection by Mike James cant make the save but cards in front 109 and Jody theyre not getting beat back door back door theyre not giving up a lot of easy baskets in the early going t Johnson in the game and we mentioned him he had had a great trip to New York and and played pretty well the other day against New Mexico State Joy look at this in the last three games you were there for the Texas and Indiana games hes been fantastic when hes been out there all that against Indiana coming in the second half of the game as well when Tyler Johnson has been on the floor for Louisville recently they have been successful offensively I dont think Evans got a piece of that but I think he might have infected it cuz he actually got Caleb Glen and Dennis Evans also in the game for Louisville right now Caleb Glen made a huge impact to that Indiana game yeah and then didnt play as well on Sunday against New Mexico State he got an opportunity earlier early in the game kind of like this but just didnt play well as Tyler over to James and theres Glenn with the offensive rebound at a put back he misses it but thats him being active and bringing energy to this team thats his uh his role on this squad on the Baseline cards bounced back from some shooting struggles early they lead Music 109 oh with a 109 lead here in the early going over Bellin maybe the most shock cards have not shot a free throw yet in this game after shooting 49 on Sunday there are the two coaches Scotty Davenport in his 19th season at Bellman 415 and 153 of course the 2011 NCA division 2 national championship and an assistant coach here at Louisville under Denny Crum and also for Rick patino and then the KY P of course played here at UFL uh Coach Jerry Jones who I saw Kenny pay visiting coach today want to wish Coach Jones well I know a lot of people have been stopping by visiting him he coached Scotty on the freshman team back in the day hed play him if Scotty didnt shoot former ear quy star that he was Curtis Williams on the court we see Tyler Johnson came in so that last segment was that a pass on a it ends up being a good pass it was an airball but a good pass there from Tyler Caleb Glenn again his job energy on this team and getting rebounds and being physical and he gets a put back right there mckenny trying to post up Tyler hes asking for him to clear out he wants he wants a shot at this but he forgets something ball goes right Smith out to FR his three off the rim and Tyler gets the rebound Johnson Glenn Evans white and Curtis Williams on on the court for the cards he lead it 129 after falling behind 73 early Evans with the Miss in the lane and thats Monumental jod cuz thats his first shot I think since the second game as the jump balls forced down low Dennis Evans is really we saw him ear he got in what four dunks in that first exhibition game and then hes kind of been a nonfactor lately well and thats what Trey white just told him something there and hes getting coaching from his own teammate on the floor hes like shoot it a little sooner because I I think he had an opportunity and he took one more dribble hes going to be a good player Curtis Williams to the bucket hes going to be good too its just taken time for Dennis Evans as weve seen him struggle with the physicality of the game that was his first field goal attempt since the opening game hat in the lane and hell get called for the travel as he ran into the 71 Evans he ran into him and then kind of shuffled couple times there how about Caleb Glenn two points and three rebounds already for Caleb he plays hard and thats going to keep you on the court it is definitely going to keep you on the Applause court cards with four offensive rebounds in the early morning Johnson Baseline kicks it out to Williams Dono yanovich going to check in at the next dead ball as well and Johnson with another deep three those two threes havent looked great no and I dont think thats I dont think youre want to see that that was actually not bad ball movement on that possession for Louisville much better than what we had been seeing but you dont want to see that threepointer at the very at the very end still had six seconds Music left 10 on the shot clock for the nights freem drives to Wheeland and were going to get a foul on I think Tyler Johnson there on the Baseline yeah I think Tyler Johnson and again hes got to recognize on that one dont reach Ive got the big fellow right there who was if Willam was going to take that shot it was going to get Block sky Clark coming back in for Tyler and then yovanovich coming in for Trey white the first time weve seen yovanovich in a couple games and Bellman has not committed a foul yet after New Mexico state had just about their entire team foul out here on Sunday suder takes yanovich right to the basket looks like he might have had a look underneath of course Evans is lurking TI in with seven on the shot clock Miss and Glenn goes way up he even went over Dennis Evans didnt he to get that Caleb Glenn is out here with a purpose tonight on the Music boards yanovich misses thought there might have been a charge Applause there Tipton another triple got Applause it Garrett Tipton likes playing in the kfcm center Jody thats 29 Points for him in the last two games 21 last year in the Music game two for three for from three in the early going Williams is a guy who yeah if he gets some looks he he could catch fire hes maybe looks to me like he could be the best shooter on this team the most consistent shooter hes a guy who has struggled with I think the speed of the game early on hes a guy who looks more comfortable as we go along uh in the games but yeah hes going to be able to shoot it hes he got does a little bit of everything Suter again with yanovich on him weel drives on Glenn turns in the lane and hits thats a freshman stake there of Caleb Glenn he drives in the lane and then Caleb kind of just relaxes for a split second and gives him that little bit of an opening and I think Kaleb might be coming out here hes had a pretty good look so far Hunley Hatfield set the check in for the cards of the about yanov a little trouble dribbling it there Williams with the heat check off the back of the rim now that wasnt really in the offense though no and thats what this team does they do it so many times Caleb Glenn gets his hand on the ball get a deflection Applause there had thinking twice before trying to shoot over Evans wheen will try it he misses and Glenn with the rebound were going to get a foul I think is that on Glenn its going to be on Glenn yeah he kind of gave him a little shove well see a replay as week go to break though here Curtis Williams getting a three and Tipton with the three as we go back to back threes theres the Tipton and then the Curtis Williams three is a cards lead Music 1514 back here in the KFC up Center L with a 1514 lead on bellan and that Louisville threepoint defense has been much improved in the last four games and so far tonight its been great for everybody except for Garrett Tipton I say Tipton two of three the team two of eight for Beller but you look at in the last four games and again that is something that uh that early on they were getting so opponents were getting so many easy open looks and Louisville has done a better job on the defensive end as far as the threepoint line is concerned Knights have not committed or been called for a foul yet in the first 12 plus minutes of this half and it was a foul on Caleb Glenn as we went to the break so his first foul Louisville now has four and Huntley Hatfield came in for Dennis Evans and not Glenn so Glenn and Huntley Hatfield on the floor with Williams Clark Suter by Clark drives tries to get it out to Tipton its knocked away one on the shot clock hes going to have to shoot it from midcourt and the Ws been firing he misses the loose ball and sud able to save that on the sideline right in front of us its just a hustle play Louisville plent time for B but Tipton just bullies his way into the paint cant get it to go and K that was three Louisville guys looking at the ball and just kind of Kenny Payne just puts his hand on his head like what do Ive got to do as Huntley Hatfield gets it underneath and its going to be out of balance off of Beller Hunley hfield played so well in New York and then kind of regressed a little bit in the New Mexico State game really really the effort more than anything in the New Mexico State game I thought he just came out and and and kind of went through the motions as coach Payne said hes got to have more from Brandon Huntley Hatfield if this team is going to do anything uh uh capable of what they they think theyre can do if theyre going to win any games at all hes got to be a factor career high 14 rebounds in the Chattanooga game Scott Clark gets to the basket and scores and increases that Louisville lead to three which is their largest lead of the half Beller guys always looking to shoot but always going to make that extra pass and we see it there its Hunley Hatfield I think he got him with I dont think he got him with his sand got him with his leg well see Scott Clark here as look watch watch here watch Mike James hutley Hatfield comes up set the pick Mike James is there drawing guys and Clark just goes right to him he actually had Mike James open there for a second Alec F to the line for two free throws shooting 83 so far this season graduate student from Cincinnati Ohio and famed Mohler High School the Aller of the likes Barry Lin Ken griffy Jr and Alec freem as we see sky Clark first three games and in the the last three games he remember yeah the first three games all here in the KFC Im sorry he did not hit a threepointer and then uh came back from New York and scored 29 in the win Mexico State let me correct myself I just saw that replay up on the big screen here that was not a foul out on Brandon Huntley atfield it live I saw what the official saw and I looked like it was but it was Music not Clark dribbling right into a double team right there away from try to call timeout and they get the time out they did get the timeout looked like it might be a jump ball but freem be wherewithal to call that time out and see thats where sky Clark has got to be better as the point guard of this team youve got guys around you that are open and he drove right into the heart of what ended up being an easy double team and an easy turnover in steal for Beller you cant do that if youre the point guard get a look at Kenny Payne in the uh in the cards huddle you see through six games last year the cards of course started the season 0 and six this year the points per game up free throw percentage about the same and and the rebound thats effort the rebounding uh much improved it it is theyve been doing a much better job on the boards and as we mentioned earlier as we mentioned earlier on the threepoint line and when you combine the rebounding and the threepoint line of being more aggressive you look and and youre going to win some games and and the turnovers are down yeah that was obviously a major issue last season that uh we say that in tonight already with five turnovers here for Louisville trainer make it a little hard for the knights to get it in bounds James guarding Suter maybe the key on the turnovers tonight till five turnover L only two points off the turnovers uh for Beller Suter takes James of the basket but Smith on the cut the lane back out to Wheeling six on the shot clock for bellerin bash kicks it out to Smith for the three and he got it Billy Smith thats just take it on one side note were going to go back to the other side swing it into the left toe go to the right swing it back in and go inside and come back out its just a little bit of a uh InNOut game there for Beller and a school of the Louisville defense and Wen didnt Panic with the shot clock running down when he got in the paint and kicked it out to Smith for that triple as hes the first Knight to hit a three other than Tipton the third lead change of the half and Bash beats everybody down court and scores and the Bellin lead is up to four and Kenny Payne has seen enough of that yeah thats a bad segment for Louisville there as they now Trail 2117 check out the ball movement here for the nights you see bash wheelen gets in the lane shot clock running down Smith makes himself available and then hits the triple and Kent the one thing about that and its its so indicative of this development team when theyre playing well is not only are they moving the ball and guys moving without the ball but the balls going inside out inside out back around the other way you see Scott Davenport as theyve made five assists on eight M field goals popy as also called he has a new grandson Jake Scott Davenport congrats to Ashley and Russ as Ren now has a baby brother Williams to white white will try the three and he got it and CS are back within one the fourth player with a three for Louisville tonight that SN a 70 Beller run back out to Smith hell try another three cant get it to go trainer with a rebound for the Applause cars o and I thought white and James both passed up pretty good looks at three swinging over get Williams a good look on a three little short that was as good a shot as hes going to get that is as good shot wide open deflection by Trey white Belling ball in the Baseline 404 to play lead by one the one thing that Louisville with especially with this lineup that is in there right now is the length and I think that Bo has bothered Beller a little bit on the defensive end when youve got trainer and Williams and and James with with white theyve got a lot of length as you see theyre getting their hands on a lot of balls and not allowing Beller to get into as much theyre still getting some good looks and some good shots when they move it but it takes a little longer again this bman program in its fourth and final year doesnt appear the NCA is going to grant them that waiver so their fourth and final year of transitioning from NCA division 2 to one and Pete Suter just absolutely makes a man move on the Baseline to put bman back up by three yeah it takes it right at Trey white and then the help coming over goes right through two Defenders the pedigree of these Bellin players winners in high school sud a starter on two state championship teams at carel as Tipton beats everybody down the court for the dunk Tiptons in double figures with 10 for the second straight year in the KFC Yum Center and Bellin leads by five whoa a screen on skott Clark suor knocked down and were going to get a foul on Clark and the Beller bench up and celebrating because the knights have wrestled away controller this one Dez mckenny to Garrett tipped it for the slam Knights on an 11 7 three Music run for New Mexico state on Sunday and cards have not drawn a foul tonight just before the timeout we had uh sky Clark called for a personal foul as he set a screen on Pete Suter you know and Kent the one thing that we saw on Sunday what Louisville did so well was take the ball to the basket thats how they were drawing all those fouls really the cards havent been doing that a whole lot here this evening Smith in the paint back to Wheeling 10 on the shot clock heres Tipton he has IND figures already gets in the painton trainer with a block his second of the game Tipton leads everybody with 10 points so far tonight Clark Williams white trainer and James on the court for the cards trailing by five and the scoring drought at just over two minutes Williams forcing that was a little forced it was it was a good idea I like to actually take them to the basket but not like that theres a wide open three for Tipton he missed that hes not going to miss very many of those and he was absolutely wide open that might have been the closest person to him I like that idea on the last trip by Curtis Williams of trying to attack and get the ball into the into the paint but everything but the shot was good Yes actually and the extra pass there to Clark for an open three but he cant get it to go Lille get out scored 12 to six in points in the paint thats whats wrong with this Lis offense tonight we mentioned bman without Ben Johnson their leading score also Kurt H their would have been their starting center was injured before the start of the season and out for the season Williams all the way to the basket fouled by T tipon and there we go the first foul of the night for the night thatll get a bronze cheer for the crowd here in the K Im the little fans at least coming up at halftime Jody you know every other team in the ACC playing in the in the ACC challenge were going to take a look at the top five plays from day one of the challenge thats coming up at halftime also Kelsey and Luke and Joel are going to talk nonconference scheduling and some early takeaways from the first few games of the season first couple weeks of this season and of course well also have some highlights from this first half here bell with a fivepoint lead on Louisville as we near the one minute Mark 15 seconds on the shot clock for the cards white the fallway jumper misses and thatll be saved by wheelen on the Baseline I thought it was going to be Lou a ball But Here Come the Music knights weand is suor he likes that match up on Clark but Clark thought he was out of bounds he cant see he was pretty adamant about it the officials didnt see it it looked like he it looked like he was on the underneath there as and theres the first back cut of the evening and we see Alec freem score and bellmans Lead is up to Music Applause Music seven and another car caress turnover not paying attention there had it knocked away theres wheelen the bellerin cant hold it for one shot and thats what Scotty Dort wants them to do would guarantee them going into the locker room with at least a sevenpoint lead seven turnovers four by sky Clark and thats three of his that are just careless unforced turnovers suder drives in on James and were going to get an offensive foul on suder with 64 seconds left so the cards will get a chance lets see the replay on this cuz Im not sure how dony Gazza misses this well hes up hes just not positioned to see it but he well hes right on the Baseline he oh I see he stepped out he definitely stepped out of bounds Pat Drisco was out front there Tony chazza was was he on the other side of the baset he was on he was right on the other side of the basket Applause Music y another foul on McKenna plenty of fouls to give for the knights just their third of the half and theyve all come here in the last minute three 3 seconds left to play and well see if the cars can get a shot off and close this sevenpoint deficit before they head to the L I think they might even foul again if they can just got to be careful not to foul threepoint shooter or trainer oh trainer could have just turned and shot it white all the way to the basket up and in and thatll be big to give the Cs a little bit of momentum heading into locker room as they Trail by five Beller leads it after 20 minutes 2722 nice get a couple post Touches at least even if you dont shoot from the post get a couple of post touches and make this defense work a little bit same five that started the game for both teams Wheeland Hatton Music freem suder and Tipton for bman and wheelen with a kind of a circus shot pretty good defensive possession for the cards and here comes Trey White Mike James JJ trainer Scott Clark and Brandon Huntley Hatfield out there for Louisville James hit that three right at the beginning he had one more drive all the offense they got out of him in the first half and JJ trainer did not score coming off a 20point effort Huntley Hatfield trying to get something going in the paint but hasnt taken away and Kenny pay not happy about that and he is the the biggest missing piece right now for Louisville has not scored and just had the ball taken right away from him there suder over James and the paint cant get it to go the ball comes off and its going to be off trainers foot fellerman possession that Hunley Hatfields got to do something on the offensive end and then there on the defensive end he needs to grab that ball ball went off of JJ trainers foot both those guys had an opportunity to grab it trainer with a goal 10 see what happens when you dont grab the rebound when you have the opportunity there you give them another opportunity or another possession and uh you get the go in Easy bucket and now back to a sevenpoint lead here for Beller ties bellers largest lead of the game you were hoping to see a little more intensity a little more life out of this Louisville squat out of the locker room white to the basket blocked by Hatton but with 1830 left in the game Trey white will go to the line to attempt the very first free throw of the night for the cards its all they did on Sunday 49 of them and now tonight the first Applause Music two that was the first person on hat I dont believe foul trouble comeing to play fori the nights theyve committed four so far in the game no its not going to be like Mexico state where six guys foul out if it is were in for a long half Applause Music here 2923 Suter all the way to the basket takes the hit cant get it to go but he gets the offensive rebound out to freem back to Music suder tippon on Huntley Hatfield heres freem to a cutting Wheeling misses couldnt quite get it up on the rim but another offensive rebound This Time by Hatton in the lane and were going to get a foul on the cards and thats James and Trey white both looking at each other and both had a chance to get that ball neither one of them reached for it and its just a loose ball a little extra hustle from Beller and again on the base line out of bounds they get a layup but Suter cant make it the knights just kind of out hustling the cars here tonight Clark to the basket a shot in the paint but he cant get that to go and tipped him with the rebound for Bell thats a start at least Drive the ball to the basket take it to the rim and try to make something happen didnt get that one to Applause Music go tipped in the drive and Huntley Hatfield got just enough of Applause that and white will go back to the line for two more free throws in the last couple possessions at both ends the cards look more engaged yeah they do and and they theyve got to I mean that I think the the whole tale of this whole game was two possessions ago when you looked at try white and Mike James two of the guys who actually have done a good job on the boards looking at each other and the ball bouncing right between them in an easy bucket for Beller since then lilles hopefully picking up some of the intensity if not this going to be a long long second half Cars really gotten little to nothing out of Tyler Johnson whos been such a catalyst uh in their last couple games the games in New York even though they were two losses and then also the win over New Mexico State um Johnson could not score in that first half missed a couple of deep threes that werent werent great shots cards back within Applause three and Alec freem is going to go to the line as he draws the foul on skot Clark second on Music Clark Lan and Freeman has shot the only two free throws of the night for Beller in that what was it a 45minute first half yeah so well have uh four free throws a piece now for these two teams Music Applause we have not seen the one thing tonight as Mike James figs takes it into the lane man when he was D driving he had trainer wide open James going to get a look at three and he got it he started the game that way and he hits his second triple of the night we havent seen sky Clark and Tyler Johnson together thats the lineup I think has really energized this team in a couple of games recently and I just wonder if were going to get that here in sometime in the second half Johnson is is the better distributor more of a pure point guard and Clark has obviously shown us he can score he scored 29 last game Clark has played much better when hes been able to play off the ball a little bit as we see Trey white and Lena same spot as James trainer misses it Hunley Hatfield that Balls going to go off of off of tipon relable ball in the Baseline 20 seconds on the shot clock 1622 left the play and Bellin leads Kenny pays cards by Music two the knights looking for a second straight win over Louisville as Billy Smith checks in Tipton will get a break here Im sure just till that under 16 Music timeout and the cards turn it over and again another unforced turnover on an inbounds from Louisville the first inbound turnover weve seen tonight but in that first half three of the seven turnovers just totally unforced make it four now Dez mckenny in for Hatton for Beller yeah bellers two biggest wins since making that move up to division one a win in the championship game of the Aon tournament in Freedom Hall and then their very next game was their game here in the kfcm center last year to open the season that one point win over Louisville suder focused on driving on James and then its Alec freem going back door sudor finds him and the Knights are back up by four you know theyre going to do it thats what they do in Louisville you just got to be more disciplined on Music Applause defense James did that Applause even time is up on Mike James has hit two triples tonight cards Trail 33 29 with 1545 left to play into it but boy he likes this building doesnt he he and freem both graduates of bellman a couple degrees and captains on this team as well as Bellman Now with an 188 lead points in the paint that should not be the case and Huntley Hatfield and sky Clark they have seven of the cards nine turnovers here tonight white with some pretty good defense and we have Tyler Johnson on the court right now along with Trey white Brandon Hunley Outfield skot Clark and JJ trainer for the cards and Tyler well see if if he can have a little more impact on the game here in the second half and we see him in there with skot Clark I do love this offense for Louisville on the offensive end I like this line up for when these two are in there Applause together kicks it over to Clark for three and Sky able to hit the triple his second three and N nothing special there Tyler just getting the ball to him and hes in the corner open for the three well McKenna just takes Johnson right to the basket and gets the easy too and thats with one thing where as good as Tylers been in some other categories hes got to get better defensively in recognizing where hes at on the floor tip and set to check in at the next dead ball for Music bellan 10 on the shot clock for the cards Clark gets to the basket and an easy two for him probably the easiest basket the cards have scored all night its amazing what how easy it can be when you do take take the ball to the basket he put his head down and knew what he was going to do and went and Applause didnt were going to get a foul there I believe yeah fre thats his first he went down but the fou on frame we see sky Clark with a triple from the corner Tyler drawing the defense and and kicking it over to Sky for the open three lets go Music CL and back in for Beller as the cards on this possession with a chance to take the lead Tyler all the way to the basket Hunley Hatfield with a nice catch and he scores that was something we havent seen in a while and you hadnt seen that since New York that was a tough catch he did Bobble it but regained it in a hurry and put it up and scored cards on a 72 run if Huntley Hatfield gets it in the paint Bellman should not be able to stop him but cards have not been able to get it to him down there much tonight tiing to drive five on the shot clock his turnaround misses and Huntley Hatfield with the rebound cards up one looking to extend it back to Huntley Hatfield the quick spin to the Baseline on Suter and draws the foul look its amazing to me you see such a difference when Tyler is in the game with Sky it just flows better offensively for Louisville yes I know on the defensive end theyre not as good but youve got to score the basketball and its something theyve had trouble doing when the two of them havent been out there together I may have spoke too soon when I said we weren going to see foul trouble for Bellman cuz Pete sud right their their leading scorer whos playing tonight um at least for the season with Ben Johnson out heads to the Bell bench with 1327 left with three personal fouls and nowll be Hatton who draws that assignment probably on Huntley hfield but right now its Tipton and the cards go right inside to him he Powers his way up cant get that to go but hell get a couple of free throws and he is much much more engaged on the last couple possessions than what we saw early in the game from Brandon Huntley Hatfield hes only two two fouls and two rebounds 0 for one and two turnovers in the8 and 1 half minutes 8 minutes and 57 seconds he played in the first half did not do a lot and when he turned it over a couple couple of times it it looked like he kind of got mentally out of it a little bit you could see put his head down and wasnt really into it now you see him taking the ball to the basket being strong with it he came down with a big rebound on the other end of the floor a couple possessions ago Hunley Hatfield is engaged and when he is Louisvilles a different team this is just his ninth free throw attempt of the Season hes 5 for eight so far make it 6 for n and the cards are up two he already has three rebounds here in the second half Tyler Tyler with a little deflection but tipon came up with it for Applause bellerin and were going to get another foul on free on a Applause screen he was kind of sideways and already after they didnt commit a foul until about a minute left in that first half or get called for one right now six team fouls on the knights here with 133 minutes left to play so the cards could potentially shoot some free throws down the stretch in this one in a game they lead by two and I would think youd go right back to Huntley Hatfield Tyler hit that that that didnt feel like a great shot in the offense but it goes in for two no and not a lot of movement away from the ball so he just decided Im going to take take his shot and it goes in Wheeling the cut and hell go shoot two free throws this the cards largest lead of the night at Four Points with just over 12 and a half minutes the play and the third personal foul now on Brandon Huntley Music Hatfield Im sorry Mike James that foul on his third personal foul James talking to Pat Drisco about something there not sure what it Applause was we misses the first of two free throws you know James started the year so hot that 25 points 10 rebounds in the opener hell head to the bench with eight points here tonight he does have two threes which those two threes are more than hes hit in the last four games combined just one for 10 he didnt know he was had three fouls upset coming out but took him out with three fouls wheeler knocks in the second free throw and the lead is Applause three Johnson Clark white Huntley Hatfield and Caleb Glenn for male High star and off the cut Scott Clark cutting with a purpose there Jody not only that but a good job by Hunley Hatfield in the hand off cuz he faked it going kind of one way and knew exactly what he was doing he was telling Sky the entire time and good job there and over and back now for Louisville and that was the two captains Tipton and frame energy on the floor right now for Louisville Huntley Hatfield engaged Caleb Glenn out there gives him a little more energy some hustle and then Tyler Johnson and sky Clark together I I cant stress enough how much its different the offense is as thats an unforced turnover there by the Freshman Smith to tipped in in the paint white on him Smith with a nice pump fake and the running jumper cant go Glenn with the rebound five rebounds for the Freshman Caleb Glenn you wonder down the stretch here Jody as were going to get a foul on Smith on the Johnson Drive well talk about it after the break Louisville with a fivepoint lead with 1141 to Music go back there in the KFC y center 1141 to play Louisville leading B Tyler Johnson line Bellman with no field goals in the last 310 and Louisville is five for five in that span and one of the reasons the cards have outscored the nights 2 to9 in the first eight plus minutes of this second half to just erase that 5 point Bellman halftime deficit and right now Louisville with its biggest lead of the night at Applause 4336 cards with Johnson Clark Glen trainer and white Tipton wheen suder frame and Hatton on the court for the night Suter with three personal fouls and Coach Davenport going back to him we will get a look at a three was a mans rebound right there thats six of them as Tyler goes right to the basket that ones blocked but attacking Tyler Johnson El is three for 14 from three tonight the knights not named Garrett Tipton just one for Music Applause Music eight Johnson with the runner and boy what a difference he makes he does six points two assists and two rebounds all in a 5 and 1 half minute stretch here in the second half and theres sky and Tyler creating something to the back court an offensive foul putting a little pressure on Beller that is the third personal foul on Alec freem all on screens as the Louisville lead is nine and bellmans already committed eight personal fouls were been called for eight personal fouls after just three and all in really the final minute of that first half and Scotty dport spent I would say 90 of that time out having a discussion with Pat drisol as sky Clark hits the triple from the corner and the cars are now up by 12 Clark just looks comfortable out here in the second half he looks comfortable with the other guys that are playing around him and letting things come to him good look there from three the trend continue sky Clark and Trey white have both scored in double figures in every game this season for Louisville Clark with 15 right now coming off his career had 299 Suter on the drive cant get the the Finish there and then tryer cant come up with the loose ball Suter drives again as it knocked Johnson deflected it Im not sure that didnt go off Su yeah it was it was an interesting the way Johnson deflected it it looked like it did go Suter but neither official had a good look as you see skot Clark he had a good look and a good look at three right there for skot Clark who now has 15 airball by Tipton as hes still stuck on 10 points hes hes kind of forcing some things now and you can tell its kind of got to him a little bit a couple Miss shots have compounded things and that one you know just just not a couple good shots and now were going to get the foul on very similar to the foul Suter Drew late in that first half on SC K Clark he does it on trainer this time I was wondering if fatigue might come into play here this bellerin team played Sunday early evening at West Virginia and theyre also shorthanded obviously without leading score Ben Johnson Applause and Bash Wheeland says fatigue what fatigue he drives in gets a lefthanded shot to go and hell get a chance for a threepoint play here as the knights are back within 10 lets take a look at that Jody yeah we watch Caleb Glenn get beat the Freshman makes a freshman mistake and then fouls Johnson sidelined by the way by a hip injury Landon hacker sidelined by a knee injury for the knights and Kurt hulf who would be their starting center out for the entire season with a knee injury as well ban back within nine Tyler Johnson gets it to trainer in the paint boy did he Elevate to get that in tell you what JJ trainer his mom elevated right shes sitting real close to us and she got up on that one a nice job by trainer and by the way that points in the paint now 2216 Beller is the third personal foul there on Caleb Glenn and that K that statistical line for Tyler Johnson now six points three assists and two rebounds in six minutes here in the second half is that the fourth foul on James zero Mike James thats Music four Mike James very upset on that I did not see it lets see the Music foul cant really tell a whole lot there they both went on the ground and there wasnt a whole lot of contact but there was a foul called James will head to the blal bench he has eight points tonight but four personal fouls now 923 you figure hell sit until the under four at least and well see if Bellman can get back in this game as Wan hits the free throw 10point game 923 Applause Music Applause left so bman with in nine Applause here I was going to say the cards have taken this lead by not settling for bad threes driving and then thats the third bad three weve seen uh Tyler Johnson shoot tonight free with a baseline jumper got it and Bellman is back within seven so the kns showing a little bit of life here with 850 to play yeah for all the good that he has done Kenny Paynes going to take a timeout for all the good that Tyler Johnson has done that threepointer was not good because it was never even close and it gave b a chance to cut the lead to seven 46 seconds to settle the River City rivalry here lets take a look at the notable nonconference games for bman theyre well Tred they are Washington at Kansas State at West Virginia here still going to play Utah at BYU later in December last year over the years they played Duke at Clemson at Kentucky last year at Louisville last year cards seven of 21 from three 11 of 22 from Two and theyll get a three in the corner from Scott Clark cant get it to go but trainer with the offensive rebound and hes got he gets it to go he also had Hunley Hatfield under the basket his mom loves it he had Hunley Hatfield under the basket but hes got that soft little touch from right in that spot and a good job for trainer on the offensive putback a foul on Trey white on the drive and were going to shoot a lot of free throws here again tonight I believe Ken you jinxed it theres no way its going to catch up till Sunday though uh its we got a long way to do that heres sud the sophomore from Carmel Indiana Carmel High School entering the evening a 70 free throw shooter a starter on state championship teams Jodys a freshman and a junior and they didnt have the tournament was a sophomore because of Co pretty impressive and I think that winning pedigree is something that scottd Port recruits at bellam he does thats something that they always look for guys from winning programs guys from teams that have gone to one state championships or at least gone to championships and he loves to get those typ of kids in his program and its worked 5245 Suter up the six points three nights and double figures bash weedland leading them with 14 points as Johnson misses the runner and Clark runs down the offensive rebound gets it to White in a corner for three thats long and Bash with the rebound for the knights as theyll try to cut into this sevenpoint deficit with under to play shoter the drive on Hunley Hatfield out frems three is off and Huntley Hatfield with the rebound thats now seven rebounds for Huntley Hatfield so five here in the second half its the time in the game when bman would have maybe gone to Ben Johnson for a three and hes not available T how about Huntley Hatfield inside the offensive rebound of the putb thats rebound number seven and thats a big one to put back there fair to say that the as we get another offensive foul here on bellerin foul on number Music 22 I was waiting for an explosion for that Bellman bench 9point lead a really good looks great by the way he does a really good 13 minutes this half most of it has been with Tyler Johnson and sky Clark on the floor together brand and Huntley Hatfield engaged Trey Whites made a couple of shots Louisville offensively has been pretty good this half well see what they do coming out of that timeout Ls already hit seven threepointers in this game and that ties their season high as they go right into Hunley half field and how about Alec freem with the defensive stop but the 73 is the same number they hit in that onepoint loss to Texas up in Madison Square Garden Applause Jody Tiptons Baseline jumper short and thatll be rebound number nine for Huntley Hatfield Tipton just cant get going four of 14 for hes been stuck on 10 points for a while Clark threes off see if the knights have one more run left in them they Trail by nine with 621 left to play bash weedland leads Beller with 14 points Tipton has 10 freem has 10 and for Louisville sky Clark with 15 to lead the way and Trey white with 11 can at the under eight the Under 12 of the first half Tipton was three of five from the field and had eight points since then hes one of nine from the field and it was that dunk on the break right that was his last basket that was his last Music basket shter to wheelen and he gets a clean Lane right to the basket and he has 16 points trainer gambled missed on the gamble no help there for Louisville on defense were going to get Caleb Glenn back in here for Louisville as they have really shortened thats going to be an offensive Applause Music foul see it Music here its a lot of he went down hard thir bash wheelen with 16 points to lead Bellman one off of his career high scored 17 at Kansas State earlier this season bash might go for that right here 13 on the shot clock this feels like a key possession in a sevenpoint game with 5 and 12 minutes to play and Garrett Tipton hits the triple he has 13 points and pman is back within four he had missed seven shots in a row but he got that one to go down to cut the lead to four sud did it again and Im Im surprised they didnt call that looked like the most etic well if I I dont know if you run into Caleb Glenn that may well be the result were going to get a foul here on the rebound and I think Caleb Glenn got foul are they going to call that on are they going to and the bench is asking to the dou bonus theres the tip in three and the Louisville bench asking them to look at the what they thought was a flop for Tony chazza standing in the middle of the floor is not going to listen to coach Davenport or coach Payne Glenn this is where Caleb Glenn has struggled m uh this season just one for six now from the line this season and hell get a second chance and a chance to increase this Louisville lead and he misses them Applause both big defensively for Louisville ween with Leeds B with 16 that one is short but cards cant come over the rebound as Glenn has it go off his hand out of bounds hes going to come out for Huntley Hatfield a block by Trey white there though carway half field with a game high nine rebounds we defense here we go 29 on the shot clock 42 left to play yeah I was going to say the ball never hit the rim theyre going to review it theyre back at 10 put it back to 10 okay 10 seconds on the shot clock 452 left to play Louisville by four and the cards just one for seven their last seven field goal attempts a 229 scoring drought and theyll get a chance to talk about it in a Timeout and Kent that is where Beller is so dangerous on those inbounds plays underneath the basket and the Louisville coaching staff given their guys high fives on there CU they did a really nice job they Swit couple of guys switched they didnt let anything theres Cutters theres movers about five layups on that same play uh throughout the course of the game Huntley Hatfield with the layup with 721 left the play in this game and that was Ws last field goal last points that gave him a 54 45 lead but the last five points have been scored by the Music knights without question and I know you have two schools just a couple miles apart but the best crowd weve had in here this season it is a its a been a good night here for uh for basketball in the city so far this is a two game series that came about when Bellman let Louisville use Freedom Hall for the NCA volleyball tournament a couple years ago this the final year of that two game series and by the way the Louisville volleyball team will be back here in the KFC Im were going to get a fourth foul on freem as Tyler Johnson goes to the Music groundin basketball fourth foul on FR 10th now on the night so cards will now shoot two the remainder of this one but the volleyball team back in here this weekend again to host NCAA volleyball or this week Thursday and hopefully Friday a lot of offensive fouls so far in this one is Trey white the jumper from the Baseline and that rattles Applause out cards drop now at 2 and 12 minutes and were going to get another offensive foul this time on Billy Music Smith I mean that that is like at least 10 offensive fouls combined on these two teams in this half look at this one number zero Mike James replacing JJ TR Mike James back in with four fouls hes been out for quite a while might want to go back to Huntley Hatfield oh Johnson treding to hit a cutting James off his fingertips Smith beats everybody down he gets hes going to go to the line foul on Trey white so Billy Smith will get two free throws here and a chance to cut that Loval lead to just two if he hits them both itll cap a itll be a 70 bman run and Smith has not missed a free throw yet this season two for two so they transfer from Miami of Ohio when the lales had success in this half they were going to the Applause basket Smith hits the first free throw the 67 sophomore from Indianapolis rebuff Jesuit High School started 14 games last year for the Red Hawks and a chance to hit a second free throw and G Bellman within two points with 404 to play and this could get inter down the stretch cards have not scored since Applause Music Applause 721 yeah now they look be to get Hunley Hatfield posting up hes going to come set a screen for Johnson and then if he hes got mckin and that was a good offensive possession it wasnt it it was and he went one way and actually decided to go the other way as Huntley Hatfield now on the defensive Music end wayen misses the three and Clark with the rebound for the Cs oh what a move he put the Defenders and he had Huntley Hatfield early he decided he was going to put his head down and go to the basket split the Defenders and a nice little Nifty move from skot Clark feels like a key stretch there bellerin had got back with him two and L with a quick 40 Run 3 minutes left to play tipped him for three got it and Huntley Hatfield did a nice job on the first time running him off of the threepoint line but then they had to make two more passes and Huntley Hatfield got caught up in some traffic and gave him just enough room to hit the three tipon now up to 16 points Clark with 17 to lead all scor two and a half minutes left to play L by three see if they go back to Huntley Hatfield inside theyll bring the double as shooter goes down again and then look at the pass from Johnson to James for the easy Applause Music two mckenny likes the match up on Johnson he took him to the basket earlier well see if they can get a tipon shot here late in the shot clock 10 seconds to shoot were going to get a foul on skot Clark and thatll get Garrett TI in two free throws when we Music return Clark all the way to the basket for two Garrett Tipton says hold on a minute fellas we still got a game fivepoint difference 2 minutes left they had a career high 29 Points in Sundays overtime win over Mexico State and sky Clark doing it again tonight 17 points to lead the car he has been really good here in the second half for Louisville as Tipton hits the first free throw to cut it to four you see the game summary there Tipton has equaled Clark with those 17 points and Tiptons four for four from the line this season and now two for two tonight and the lead is back to three for the cards with 205 to Play 2 Minutes to settle who has the bragging rights in the River City Louisville leading Bellman 60 57 the card looking get over 500 at 4 and three with a win before they start ACC play on Sunday at Virginia Tech 10 seconds on the shot clock Johnson with a jumper and got it what a shot from the freshman and the lead is back to five Difference Maker here in the second half Tyler Johnson now Louisville needs to do something defensively and they got a matchup Music problem Suter inside and weve kind of seen that called both way were get a technical on Scotty Davenport I think its on the Applause Music Applause bench that has been brewing for a while theyve called that some theyve looked like flops kind of at both ends throughout the night and that time it was Tyler Johnson inside I mean honestly theres not a ton of contact been on any of them really and there been about 20 theres been a lot of them and we Men actually lets watch lets watch the replay here here we go Tyler Music inside now was he was he outside the restricted area I wasnt even looking at that white hits one of two free throws to the lead to six lobal possession at the other end of the floor under the Beller basket that had been brewing for a while after uh coach Davenport spent that almost that entire time out earlier in this half talking to Applause padris Moville four of their last four after missing eight in a row 10 on the shot CLX Johnson dribbles into everybody and hes going to foul and thats going to give Alec Frank two free throws with 110 left and bellerin a chance to cut into this lead with the clock stopped and as good as Johnson has been tonight he does have five assists and that was just his third turnover but he went right into all that TR I was going to say weve praised him a lot and rightly so he has been good in the second half but that was a terrible possession right there not only Kenny P saying you cant be go behind your back middle you cant dribble in traffic and then try to go behind your back and then to compound it even more you foul you know so far away from the basket you cant Alec F five for five from the line tonight he has 11 points now 12 and the Louisville lead is four with 110 to Music Applause go and you figure this might be the last possession where we see it play out through the shot SP and Kenny and Kenny Payne telling setting something up here telling sky Clark giving him directions I think bman will let this possession go and then Scotty down board does like to stretch out the game so swing it six on the shot clock inside the trainer for the overhead slam and the Louis lead is six wow thats a great possession from Louisville the skip pass from White the threepointer from bman Off the Mark were going to get a foul the skip pass though into the corner from white to James to Clark and and then the easy dunk that is great ball movement and a really good Music possession the drive by white in the corner and look at the ball Applause movement is that the fifth foul on Mike James did they call that on James so Mike James fouls out here 35 seconds left to play bash Wheeland heading to the line for Applause Beller card shooting 55 from the field in this second half and bellerin is 31 one thing I will say and theyre looking at something I cant figure out what were looking at here a foul on that drive Im not sure at the monitor checking something out so 35 seconds left to play Louisville with a sixpoint lead CS with two timeouts Beller with just one timeout but the knights do have the possession arrow and Louisville by the way Jody now with the lead points in the paint 2824 cards it was 18 to six at one point 16 to six at one point I still dont know what were looking at Applause Music Applause Music here Tony chza says nothing so were not going to worry about Music it now I feel like down the stretch here weand has kind of looked for the three a couple times which Louisvilles probably all right with cuz hes just four for 22 this season from three but he does have 16 points and five rebounds and the 66 graduate from Cincinnati Ohios Lakota East High School hes got that bment degree as well step to the line and hits the free throw to get the knights within five with 35 seconds left to play and Scotty dport will foul relatively quickly I think theyll try to get a steal if they get it over half court theyll try to extend this game as long as they can I think you have to at this Applause point little pressure from the knights Clark gets it and theyll foul immediately Billy Smith will put Scott Clark to the line Clark has not attempted a free throw yet tonight fourth foul on Billy Smith sky Clark to the line for Louisville where he is he was 15 of 16 on Sunday by the way in that New Mexico State game and shooting 76 for the season seven of nine against Indiana last week in New York and one for one tonight and the lead is back to five and hell have a chance to make it a two possession game with a second free throw with 339 seconds left Music those two look pretty good for Sky hes up to 19 points the lead is six 30 seconds and counting free all the way to the basket and I thought white might have got a piece of it but it still goes in and bellerin has cut the lead to four and theyll use their final timeout with 265 seconds on the clock and whats the strategy session in chle now JY well I think if youre Louisville you got to know that pressure is coming youre going to get fouled you got to be strong with the ball second half Cars will have four more nonconference games but they are they will be after their ACC opener on Sunday at Virginia Tech all right here we go Louisville ball cards with two timeouts Bellman does not have any timeouts but does have the possession arrow and the nights are pressing well see if the cards can get it in they canot and theyll call one of those two timeouts and now trainer throwing it in there they had they had the guys stacked up they doubled Clark and Music Johnson Johnson going down to the Baseline but then kind of standing still hes got to move a little bit more there well see if Louisville changes anything up here as they stack the guys down the court on that one belmans going to foul right when the ball comes into play if they dont get a steal Applause if youre Beller who on the court for Louisville if you had a pick right now youd want to foul Huntley Hatfield right yes because trainers throwing the ball in I think you if if Huntley Hatfield gets it you definitely want to foul him now hle Hatfield simply for his size and length Advantage though if he would maybe Sprint down to the Baseline they should be able to get it into him well see if uh Johnson or Clark is able to free themselves up here trainer set to throw it in the Bellman will not guard the inbounds pass trainer throws it in but its deflected Byfield late coming up and thats what theyre telling him Huntley Hatfield theyre tell him to settle down Hunley Hatfield flashed up but he did it late did any time come off some time had to come off the clock right the ball was tipped right I mean is that what we started with 25 minut or was it 265 gets it into Huntley atfield and oh scottty dport one of the walk but Huntley Hatfield will go to the line where he is one for two tonight and will so suder fouls out suder fouls out with six points and seven Music rebounds and at this point if the cards can hit their free throws and not turn it over against that press just get it in bounds really because theyre going to get fouled immediately they will get out of here with a win and be over 500 this season Outfield one of two tonight six of nine for the season 75 free throw shooter last Applause Music year he misses the back of the Applause rim now if youre Beller you go for a quick two you try to get to no I think you go I think you go for a quick two youve got Applause time I still think right now now I think you got to go for a three lets see Ken is probably going to go to the basket on Johnson Im guessing he does and he gets the easy to with 178 left and the Knights are within three they get it into Applause Clark and get the foul on tipon trying to really close to being no that was but it was really close to being a jump ball just before that and the Beller couldnt see who it was before Tipton reached in to try to grab it and Clark did a nice job of kind of accelerating through the contact Clark two for two from the line tonight a chance to get over the 20 point mark again if you can just did one of these two free throws and one of the two free throws would also make it a twopossession game he hits the first and the cards are up by four its a two possession game now bman you have to come down and get a you get a three as you see Louisville at the free throw line not quite 49 of them like it was on Sunday but sky Clark now three for three after going 15 of 16 against New Mexico state and hitting them under some pretty serious game pressure here right now see if mckenny goes again to the bass no theyre going to go for the three now and Smith three in the corner is good and its a twopoint game with n seconds left cars get it into white Tipton fouls him and itll be Trey white going to the line with 83 seconds left the play and goodness gracious Jody theyre going to make him earn it they are as we see a replay on this they come down the floor and just not sure where Huntley Hatfield was on that one coming out late Billy Smith his second triple of the night whites five for six from the line tonight make it six for seven and the lead is three but this is the big one here would make it a twopossession game with 83 seconds left youre getting into the territory Applause where itll be tough for them without a turnover to get two possessions and it is a two possession Trey white with now full points with 7268 Applause Music Applause cars McKenna all the way to the basket it wont go the rebound for Huntley Hatfield thats his 10th rebound of the night hell get to shoot two free throws and Louisville is going to get out of here with a win that will improve the cards to four and three this season but boy did they have to earn it tonight yes they did in a huge second half from Tyler Johnson Hunley Hatfield and sky Clark sky Clark with 15 points in the second half all of those points or all but three of those points coming with Tyler on the floor on the floor together as we said early on Ken its a difference you can see a big difference out there with those two guys playing together and Clark playing off the ball bin after committing after being caught for only three personal fouls in that first half and all really in the final minute minute 22 19 fouls in the second half for Bellman as Huntley Hatfield hits the free throw he has nine points and 10 rebounds and the Louisville lead is five with 18 seconds left to go a double double no he does not get the double double but Louisville will get out of here with a win and the cards are 4 and three heading into ACC play on Sunday at Virginia T thats a good win for Lille because of the fact that Louisville lost to this team
