Third season at Cal for the Mad Dog Opening tip Golden Bears wearing the whites and its controlled by Cal as here is Justin Pippen across the timeline Cal with wins against Cal State Bakersfield right state and Cal State Fullerton And that loss to Kansas State last Thursday in the Little Apple Its a miscommunication Day Ames but kept alive by Lee Dort Still 10 to shoot cheering Justin Pippen John Camden spinning the tough step back from the wing and the rebound run down by Presbyterian and that is Carl Parish to third Parish has a lot more on his plate as Presbyterian losing their point guard Eric Taylor to an injury at Sacramento State on Sunday as they lost a tough one lost by two The Hornets up in the state capital after leading for the majority of that game and the rebound not free picked up and the put back inside by Tristan Wilson for Presbyterian A nice hustle by the Blue Host They just kept the line on the glass Sophomore from Miami starting five for Mark Madson Same group that had started every game for California John Camden and the lob inside for Lee Dort and a good read and a steal by Jonah Pierce A transfer from Francis Marian University for Presbyterian on the drive and Josh Picket called for traveling and a turnover by the Blue Hose Well thats a danger when you go against Cal Rocks and you drive you better be able to finish because theyve got Lee Dor inside Hes caused quite a few travels and altered quite a few shots Fullourt pressure from Presbyterian again a bit shorthanded without Eric Taylor who was on the bench with a boot on his right foot And that is a significant loss for them as Taylor the starting point guard was leading but in assists Here is Chris Bell in the lane The step back from Bon and Roxy thats what hes added to his game You know you know he can shoot it but at 67 he can really get his own and go over the top of you Tied at two Two minutes in Heres Jod Pierce Jaylen Peterson the handoff Shot clock down to 10 Carl Paris the third A tough step back off balance too strong from John Picket and the rebound Chris Bell recovers it for Cal Shot clock down to 10 Bell gets into the lane Has a shot blocked and pulled down by a Presbyterian Carl Paris to third Good defense by Presbyterian cheering Now its Jaylen Peterson backing his way in Up and under down low and dropped in by Jonah Pierce Nice patience inside by Pierce Just got his position carved it out Pierce averaging 15 points and 11 rebounds a game He can score in the paint Day Ames finds Chris Bell short of the three Jonah Pierce the rebound Presbyterian running Carl Paris to third The kick out Left open Tristan Wilson trailing the play Hits a three and its 72 Presbyterian Yeah not the kind of start youd expect from Cal And this Presbyterian team really is playing with a lot of spirit with their leader and point guard out Theyre stepping it up And a good start for Quinton Ferrell and the Blue Hose here in Berkeley tonight Chris Bell in the corner answers with a three Well he needed that Roxy He just kind of you know hes got the confidence but uh and and coach Frell talked about that with us in practice today They he knows theyre a good threepoint shooting team He wants his team to get out there and pressure from three Bell has all five for Cal Pull up by Wilson Rims out the rebound lead Cal looking to push it Here comes Justin Pippen down low to Lee Dort and Dort Rams it home to tie the game Pass just too easy and really dont doesnt have a lot of answer for that inside Presbyterian but Justin Pippen talked to us in practice about that He really wants to get his guys going Felt he didnt have the kind of game that hes capable of last game He said I got to get my guys going He sure got Lee Dor going Doru fouled out in just 19 minutes did have 10 points Kansas State in the lane The floater rims off but a put back and the tip in by Jonah Pierce for Presbyterian Yeah thats the second time that Presbyterian has got inside the Cal defense That hasnt happened very much this year Offensive putbacks Mark Matson making a sub Not happy I think was in his interior defense ability to rebound Day Ames the crossover pull back Yeah he does that like its its a its second nature He just he steps back Great space with his dribble and really is able to get that shot off underneath Lup missed and hitting the deck hard and a foul as Tristan Wilson went crashing to the floor and a couple of free throws coming back for for Presbyterian Cal back in the game off to a sluggish start but you can the stats will bury you out on that because look how they started their first two games They couldnt find their their mark from three but the last two games theyve really been on fire and Mark Matsons been selling us on his team and really you know hes with his team every day and he knows they can shoot it but they hadnt really gotten off the schneide They have the last two games Thats a pleasant sign because once they knock the shots down from three their interior guys can really go to work One more shot for Tristan Wilson Foul is on John Candid of Cal and Wilson has seven and Presbyterians 11 Theres that fullourt press again by Presbyterian They would like to extend the floor make Cal work a little bit harder maybe take some of the legs off the shooters so they dont shoot the same percentages theyve been shooting for the last game or two Los El checks into senior from Serbia as Day Ames curls to the bucket and throws it off the window and a loose ball tracked down and its saved by Presbyterian and theyll now bring it across with Josh Picket Good hustle by Presbyterian Again a team that has been in the postseason each of the last two years Theyve lost in the first round of the CBI lost to Illinois State last year Underneath with a left hand it falls short from Cheyu the red shirt freshman from Houston Yeah again getting all the way to the rim Just having a tough time finishing over the top of Cal Here is Pippen and the skip to Chris Bell THREE THATS a great find by Justin Pippen again Hes really on his mark finding his shooter When you have a guy that can shoot the ball like Chris Bell you got to find him in the open floor Presbyterian made a mistake and left him open in the corner First lead for the Bears and Bell is eight of Cals 12 Iverson King from the corner rattles out gets the deflection out to him and a press 20 for the Blue Hose Yeah he was wide open the corner pass went on his ankles You want to get shooters the ball at their waist or higher shoulder level Shot clock approaching five Iverson King spinning and a travel is called on King trying to pivot toward the lane at the turnover on Presbyterian Watch the pass by Justin Pippet I mean he made that pass all the way crosscourt He read the defense knew his teammate Chris Bell was open and he found him You want to play helpside defense Roxy but not when youre playing threepoint shooters Youve got to stay a little closer Thats your rule of thumb And I know coach Merrell will talked to his players about that They read over that today Ed shoot around Compass sucks for Cal in the ball game TT Carr the freshman from Mil Valley Also Reus Petritus checking in for Mark Madson And a timeout as a trap near midcourt forcing Day Ames to take a 30se second timeout for the Golden Bears Up one on Presbyterian All right 1 2 3 pivot foot Well you want to take a look at some aggressive defense Watch Presbyterian and their mo as soon as Day Ames comes off the ball screen They jump day Ames and they just really get him to give it up and he wont give it music up without first having to call a timeout or otherwise hed have been stuck That have been a turnover Heady play by D Ames but even better defense by Presbyterian Quinton Frell has bounced around to a few schools after he played at Presbyterian was an assistant there Head coach of the Blue Holes has also worked at the Citadel Army College of Charleston now the head coach at his alma mater as Day Ames flips it over to Chris Bell Shot clock winding down on Cal and Bell too late Didnt get it off in time and a shot clock violation Cal turns it over Well Presbyterian obviously turns the tide back You can see the defense You stay glued You stay on the floor Dont leave your feet against shooters All theyre going to do is get you off your feet Very good Good job of defense by Prising off a screen JD Fountain and the rebound on the offensive end Then Reus Petritus knocked the ball away from Cheni Jquo But right back to Presbyterian Hudson a sophomore from Augusta Georgia to post thinking hes got a mis pass but the quickness of TT Carr and a steal for C Thats good scouting Roxy Thats exactly what their play called for And Car read it beautifully Stuck in broke contact got around front of the post for the steel Ames launching in and out on the three and the rebound grabbed by Tristan Wilson for Presbyterian Blue Ho have missed six of the last seven shots to the floor but they draw a foul and a couple of free throws coming up for Presbyterian Hanging tough on the play for the Axe All three games also available on the allnew ESPN cheering app as Chiy Chiquu misses the first free throw Chia Quu from Houston Texas in his mentor by the way Oh yeah Yeah thats a pretty good mentor Theres that full court press pressure again Not sure if hes got a dream shake in his back pocket but hell get one save He will get one That was a signature move Few had that Heres Justin Pippen launching his first shot of the night Too strong and the rebound grabbed by Kalon Hudson Blue hose from Clinton South Carolina Just on the other side of the border from Charlotte and a block is called on Chris Bell Yeah Cal you know Roxy in each of their first three wins now they theyve separated defensively and thats what Mark Madsons team has done I know that thats what theyre looking for their team to do tonight Uh but theyve given up five offensive rebounds and theyve given up six points in the paint So thats not the kind of defense that Cal has played successfully when theyve been successful Theyve got to get back to the kind of defense that they can play where they dominated And speaking of defense Presbyterian has done a nice job at that end of the floor What have you seen from Presbyterian thats frustrated Cal here early in this game Well theyre aggressive Theyre a very aggressive team And when you play aggressive teams theyre going to get up in you Theyre going to challenge you Theyre not going to make it easy Theyve made things very hard for Cal Cals going to have to be patient and probably get the ball down low at least to the basket See if they get some easy scores Justin Pippen to the corner Reus Petritus hits a three His first three of the season Well thats again Roxy Justin Pippen whos distributing really taking on that leadership role finding his teammates for open looks Already four assists for Pippen in the game Yeah great job Mari Anderson to shoot for the Blue Hose JD Bowen up top tries to turn the corner deflected and run down Shot clock expiring Heating it up and it nearly went in It was online from Iverson King but it just hit the front runner Thats the kind of defense Cal needs to play Roxy Theyve done that the first few games Made it tough for Presbyterian They playing against a lot more pressure now Justin Pippen on the drive and a foul committed by Amari Anderson freshman from Greer South Carolina for Presbyterian How about Justin Pippen with already four assists on the game I mean hes finding his teammates Thats what a point guard does He recognized that selfrecognized in his last performance said I got to be better I got to distribute the ball Get the ball to my teammates I didnt do that against Kansas State And hes doing it tonight Als made three threes already in this ball game Two point guards on the floor and Lee Dort slips underneath and lays it in and a nice pass finding Dort underneath Theyve got a very good passing team on the floor Youve got Carr youve got Rita Petritus and youve got Pip and those are and John Camden I mean those guys can pass and you know what Lee Dort Yeah A much improved passer So these guys are unselfish Theyll find open guys Presbyterian has missed their last six there one for their last nine from the floor and that stays at this end with the Blue Hose Okay heres a look again I mean Lee Dor got loose and you know when when your big guys at the basket you got to have your head up He was right there for the two Cals going to go to the 23 It looks like here theyve employed this zone earlier Now theyre going to go back man It looked like they started out in the zone Now theyve decided uh that theyre going to match up They put 30 on the shot clock They shouldnt have Well that and thats why they got thats why Justin Shammy and working with Darren White and Jason Garrettson our officiating crew music and theyve gone over to the table to get that corrected But Mark Matsons team has turned up their defense here And Callus built a fivepoint lead with 9 minutes to go in the first half He must have hurt us And they are checking the clock to make sure both the shot clock and the game clock Well you Take one Put 11 on the timer Yeah heres the shot clock You can see it Theres out of bounds And yeah they theyve shortened this up So now Cal still going to go back and play with their with their man defense Short clock Iverson King three had a great job on a short clock with Presbyterian finding the open man against a really aggressive double team was something Cal worked on in practice today I mean that was an excellent double team that just meet in pre rotation passes to find the open man says the second made three for King on the season He is now two for 16 Lee Jordan finds a cutting John Camden who drops it in Heavy player proxy John Camden knows where to be His man left to double team He cuts to the basket You cant be in two places at once And averaging just under 14 points per game Season low in points against Kansas State last Thursday And a foul high top on TT Carr A foul You talk about defensive you know finding people And look at that The end of the shot clock Great job by Presbyterian Good defense by Cal just did better offense And the extra pass leads to an open shot Jonah Pierce draws a foul Will get to the line That was a really good job of of finding uh open teammates off of screens I mean Cal is so aggressive when you come off a ball screen They trap you If you try to throw it back theyll deflect you They make you go backwards But I thought Presbyterian did a excellent job cheering of getting the ball to the open man quickly Second foul cheering on John Camden First free throw knocked in by Jonah Pierce Our Wednesday night womens basketball double header Zoe Brooks Camille Pierre and number 16 NC State hosting Coastal Carolina at 6 Eastern Then Laura Ziggler and number 20 take on Morehead State Both games also available on the allnew ESPN app All games on that ESPN app Go find it ACC womens basketball double header Wednesday is John Camden missing a three and its last touch by Cal It belongs to Presbyterian inside eight Couldnt finish it off up in Sacramento and losing 6462 to Sacramento State No they were up They had opportunities to win that Now you see Cal Roxy going to the zone Theyve worked on this Mark Manson said he wanted to deploy this zone This is where Sack State had some success against Presbyterian swimming went to the two3 zone Cal now bigger team Theyre staying in their zone and the lane Jaylen Petersons first points of the night and it pulls the blue hose to within one Yeah thats the one area you dont want to get the ball in the the sweet spot center of that zone You want to keep it on the perimeter Cal gave up the middle Chris Bell hes off on that three Offensive rebound Dort powers his way back inside and Dort tries it in Cals going to have to get more of those Roxy if your shots not falling go attack the glass Youre bigger Youre stronger than Presbyterian Try to get something inside And Eric pass cheering thrown away by Josh Picket And were going back the other way and ball And Lee Dor can make a difference Roxy When hes playing hes really done this all season long Hes bigger hes taller and he does a good job keeping the ball up and getting a second chance scoring opportunity Cal Bear Calvars on the glass JUSTIN PIPPET TO pull up Pippen with his first bucket tonight And that was set up by his explosive step He drove got his defender on his heels pulled back Alante Ames and knocked that shot down square Thats their largest lead underneath and a good pass inside to Jonah Pierce That great screen to set up Pierce for the shot Heres that Procourt pressure again by Presbyterian They just want to extend See if they can keep Cal from getting to the rim Pierce with seven Tristan Wilson with seven for Presbyterian Chris Bell leading Cal leading all scorers in the game with eight Here is Bell Five to shoot Tough shot IN THE CORNER CANT defend it any better than Iver King did And hes asking for some contact Come on He wants some love He thought that should have been a three or fourpoint play Bells cheering got 10 And again he had 27 last Thursday in the Little Apple against Kansas State Josh Tek Carl Paris to third too strong for the offensive rebound IVERSON CAME ACROSS 20 FOR PRESBYTERIAN The adjustment that Presbyterian and Quinton Pharaoh needs to make in the absence of Eric Taylor their point guard and now trying to find the right combination to come forward Losing Taylor for a steady period of time out of bounds Last touch by Jaylen Peterson and a cow ball and Roxy that is an adjustment You dont just lose one of your top players and adjust and its your point guard your leader and thats really a tough loss You dont have a lot of time to think about it You play but hes playing guys at that position that have not played there and thats difficult Theres a lot of positions you can put new guys in at point guard is really hard to replace They thought about putting putting Carl Paris to third there but then it kind of takes away from what he does for this team and theyre trying to adjust and find guys cheering who are on the point as Dort goes inside Speaking of guys hes got their largest lead Yeah speaking of finding guys Cals finding Lee Dorton Thats a smart move Dont think Presbyterian has an answer for Lee Dort Dort with eight Here is Jonah Pierce backing his way in against Dort AND PIERCE OFF BUT kept alive to tip by Jaylen Peterson and then miss it was Carl Per Here comes Bell pushing in for the Bears Day Ames tries to force a pass inside to Dort Its broken up Diving is Jonah Pierce and whistle and if its a tie up it belongs to Presbyterian It is a hell ball and it belongs to the Presbyterian Blue Hose Lee Dor Roxy making his present known Hes inside going to work going to town Right hand left hand doesnt make any difference Hes commanding coachs mentality But that was a special moment with Mark Manson and his players Really enjoyed seeing that I know he enjoyed it Jonah Pierce working on Lee Dort And Pierce another nice move down low by Jonah Pierce who has nine Yeah theyre pesky Pesby materian is is you know without their point guard theyve come to play Theyre not feeling sorry for themselves Theyre just battling It is Petritus along the baseline and it rolls in for Petritus He is now two points shy of a thousand for his college career Yeah he thats what he does Thats Rita Petritus vintage Make the plays the hustle plays get to the basket your team needs you He steps up Majority of those points coming at the Air Force Academy for Petritus whos off to a slow start this year but tonight starting to get it going Jonah Pierce flips it up and in his hand And Pierce has been impressive for Presbyter Hes a goto guy You got to contend with him Cal may think about double teaming him They may need to do that Hes got 11 And the Cal lead is five with two and a half to go until halftime the Golden Bears who scored 90 plus in each of the last two games Dont think thats going to happen tonight The pace this game is being played at as Petrid is way off of that one But last touch by Presbyterian will stay at this end But the first time since 2014 Cal scored 90 plus in two straight games Thats what theyve done But you can see right now theyve got a guy inside that just going to work and you know and and you know hes just taking his time Just oneonone coverage A little help dig down by Pippen Thats a good looking move You know Cals shooting 57 Theyre holding Presbyterian to 30 Yet they cant seem to pull away but its Presbyterian whos making the hustle plays Roxy Theyve got nine offensive rebounds John Candon off the inbound And the offensive rebound low losing it going up with Felos Elich And Presbyterian takes control Yeah its just a hard thing to figure Theres a turnover Good pressure And Presbyterian gives it back over to Kale And Kales got to do more of that Roxy they got to get some hustle plays of their own I just mentioned Presbyterian with nine offensive rebounds are being out Theyre out rebounding Cal actually 16 to 10 because of it Uh you know but Cal has also not shot a free throw this game That and how when has that happened They were the leading free throw shooting team in the ACC a year ago They have shot zero tonight Presbyterians only committed one foul and theyve been disciplined at this end of the floor Yeah they sure have John Candon left open and had a clean look and the rebound Josh Picket Here comes Presbyterian Transition three and the stroke Carl Paris the third and its a twopoint game But he can shoot it His coach said today hes you know hes tough He said thats our designated shooter Hes our designated three shooter Hes his own buster Averages 14 points a game John Camden again open from D and again comes up short and the rebound grabbed by the Blue Hose So they can not only tie the game Roxy they can also take the lead with a three if they convert on this end 75 seconds left in the half Jonah Pierce CROSS THE KEY cheering AND THE REBOUND pulled down by Milos Elich and Cal Good defense by Elich The first from Pippen and Pippen cant finish at the rim and Presbyterian takes it back Transition three Too strong for the lead Paris to third and put back inside Josh Picket ties the game Yeah tough move inside Thats just a thats just bully ball You go up and get rebounds Roxy thats their 10th offensive rebound and were not even at halftime yet Tie game seven straight for Presbyterian to pull even And a block is called just the second foul on Presbyterian as John Camden on the baseline Its on Iverson King Lets look at this again Thats just comfort level on the perimeter Youre getting a chance But how about the second chance put back Thats just strength But youre giving up offensive rebounds I know Mark Madsons not happy about that Hes He didnt give up too many in his career I can promise you that You could not get offensive rebounds over the top of Mark Madson Dayday Ames and a bump on the perimeter Jonah Pierce whistled for his first Well I like the aggression Roxy I mean youre as you mentioned they havent committed a lot of fouls so I like being aggressive You cant take the fouls with you but theyre going to have to stay aggressive on Cal Theyve got some fouls if they want to use them And they may they may use all of these You just dont want to foul in the after shooting cheering Got a sixsecond differential between the shot and half clock Day Ames lost the ball Picked up underneath Milos Ess Thats a big break for Cal That ball was loose and it looked like Presbyterian had possession but Cal just finds a way to keep the ball alive Theres the loose ball Didnt grab it He lit Johnny on the spot with a chance for a threepoint play to give Cal a cushion And the first free throw attempt of the night for Cal coming up at the half from our ACC Network studio Look at the freshman around the ACC First half highlights and stats Thats all coming up at the break Well I dont know exactly what Mark Manson will talk about at halftime but I can promise you this will be one of the topics He wants his team to get to the line Thats been a staple for Mark Manson Rinse off for Milos Elich Cals been a good foul shooting team as well 80 And and so you got to get there now They use it or lose it Now you got Presbyterian who hasnt called anytime They had some pretty good success going into Pierce And obviously if they can do that thats going to help them Wilson as well But Cal you know you dont want to foul here You want to give him a shot and you dont want to give an offensive putback Heres the zone Good move change up the defense going into halftime and Presbyterian struggled against the zone at Sack State on Sunday Carl Paris a third and a three at the horn and theyll do it from Wilson and Cals up two at the half on Presbyterian Its 3129 Yeah like the move by Deliverance It always promises music to be a great great game Cal in a tight ball game with Presbyterian as we start the second half Cal by two They led by as many as seven in the first half Chris Bell leading Cal with 10 points Jonah Pierce for Presbyterian leading all scorers with 11 Cal just three of 11 from three They were just 0 for one from the line in the first half Pass deflected John Camden has it Shot clock rolling down the Bears Two to shoot Days launches a three And thats a shot clock violation It was short and another strong defensive possession for Presbyterian If you ever want to talk about how to come out of the locker room and play defense thats how you do it because and Cal was patient you know to their credit but a lot of that had to do with the defense Presbyterian there was no openings offensively for Cal on that possession Quinton Frells had his team prepared to play tonight and hes got a good defensive game plan Reach in foul called on Cal and its on Lee Dorton his first And any questions that you might have of where Presbyterians try to go this half its to Mr Pierce Theyre trying to go right back inside and see if he can deliver You know where Presbyterian College is I do I do know I actually know we talked about this today and have some people in common back there Clinton South Carolina just on the other side of the border from Charlotte in South Carolina And they played in Sacramento Sunday here tonight Theyre going to drive to Vicelia after the game tonight stay there then continue the drive to LA tomorrow morning as they play at Paulie Pavilion against UCLA on Friday night Did they know the shutdown ended I mean they can get some flights I think I have to tell coach that I didnt Well I I did Theyve been out here so long I did talk with Quinton this morning about their itinerary Im like you probably could have planned this a little better No he he is kind of incredulous You know coaches are oblivious Good move up jumper Josh Picket and were tied now I mean coaches are into the game Roxy you think hes thinking about going to travel He just wants to play this game Get his team ready and ready they are Theyve been very formidable But they battled Sack State Mike By has a talented team and they battled with the Hornets I should have won on Sunday They led for the majority of that game at a narrow twopoint loss Here is Chris Bell The pull up from Bell What a save for Bell Well you can see the confidence that Chris Bell is playing with You know he talked about he likes playing in a big game atmosphere and thats why he thought he played so well We have a shot clock issue Thats why we have the stoppage And Mark Matson was frustrated feeling that Bell was fouled and he was a little animated and ticked off of the Kansas State game the other night as well Well he sure was We talked about that again But but here you go You can see that coming off the screen here and and you know hes just open Nice job of moving without the basketball Thats thats a designated play But you know Cals got to defend here because Presbyterians hanging around You want to try to separate and you separate defensively Roxy not offensively And the longer you let a team hang in the game the more confidence and belief theyre going to have Well Cals separated defensively Theyve done that all year long THE STEP BACK THREE FOR THE LEAD Carl Paris to third Well youre okay if a guy can hit some tough shots but you know you got to come down here and try to get some easy ones yourself Second three for Parish tonight John Camden SLINGS ITSELF AROUND Its on Jaylen Peterson of Presbyterian and Dort Thats a great play call Watch the slip But you can see that first of all the step back three that just that thats just big time and then Cal music comes back the slip the screen slip the fine by Camden really again Cal great great passing team I mean they they put some assists down and they theyve increased their assist total from last year immensely improved foul shooting 71 from the line one more for Lee D who has nine now hes hes improved every facet of his game hes knocking down free throws now his hands are Hes playing good defense without fouling most of the time and and hes really as you mentioned earlier improved his pass and the other thing is sure enough as we were just gloating about his foul shooting he misses but hes also worked on his body to get in much better shape he really worked hard in the offse corner three missed by Tristan Wilson and there is Dor the rebound long outlet day one two still attacks cheering and spins it in Roxy I Im watching this I Still dont know how he got that basketball up and over and off the glass and in There was just no angle no opening but he found one somehow But did a lot of work with Sebastian Hernandez the Cal strength and conditioning coach in the offse And Lee Dort looks like a new man He might have played himself into the next level too Deflected Good hands by John Camden Nine on the shot clock on the baseline for Presbyterian Yeah lets talk Well take a look at the outlet pass here Thats a just a nice throw ahead to A And again look at that Hes got contact He uses the off I mean he did everything he could to get that ball up and off the glass Looked like he was trying to draw a foul but scored it really good Cal now is trying to match back up Shot clock down to two Peterson realized it Throws up a shot It goes as the shot clock expires Well Presbyterian has made a living hitting late shot clock opportunities tonight Thats about the third time theyve done that Tied at 36 John Camden free left open at the arc and Camden with the stroke Roxy were in a shootout now and thats great when the when things are going your way offensively Whos going to get a stop Chris Bell really heating up defensive pressure Getting better for Cal By the way Cal playing without Nolan Dorsy tonight Now with a lower leg injury and one of Cals top if not cheering Cals best defender Certainly one of their top John Camden down the lane Swatting away with it Here come the Blue Host back the other way A twoon one and Wilson gets hammered and Tristan Wilson ends up with the line The foul is on Justin Great action here You got a block in one end and another block and a foul at the other But you can see whats going on on the court here Roxy this pace is furious You see John Camden stepping up and eyeing his three Hes done that his whole career prolific threepoint music shooter knocking down a shot giving Cal a threepoint lead as Tristan Wilson at the line for Presbyterian here And the Cal foul cheering was on Justin Pippen Wilson 80 foul shooter is now three for three from the line tonight Hes a good looking sophomore Hes really been solid from the line hasnt had his threepoint shooting go the way he wants but hes capable and hes now four for four at the line and Presbyterian climbs back to within one Well again we talked about this at half I think Cals got to get back to the free throw line if they can and try to muscle themselves inside Theyve been successful with Lee Dor going there That is deflected The quick hands from Carl Paris the third and it stays at this end with Cal Yeah The problem is Presbyterian knows they want to go into Lee Dort because they were all over him Theyve got guys behind them on the side Theyre theyre really shading Lee Dort defensively Chris Bell gets free rims out the three and the rebound Jonah Pierce but then lost out of bounds by Presbyterian Yeah not a good place to save the ball if youre Presbyterian Sometimes you dont have a choice but but at least they didnt throw it right to Cal for a bucket No thats thats the coachs worst nightmare when you save it underneath your own hoop And thats happened many times You learned that in grade school Referee saying Look lets get a little chipper in there Lets you know everybody defending their space Presbyterians come in here They play hard They play tough They have not been intimidated going up against an ACC team here tonight Is the tip off the miss from Chris Bell and it puts Cal up by three Well Cam will get the tip Im not sure that he tipped it but hell get credit but who cares He was the closest guy Yeah but thats just you know thats a tough break for Presbyterian thats for sure Pass deflected picked up by Iverson King Hes left open on the baseline Had a good look and Justin Pippen pulls it down Yeah Justin Pippen high in the glass and the rebound and a foul will stay at this end says Justin Shamian Theres a shot here Yeah thats that was not John Keman Hell get credit but those were two players for Presbyterian battling for the ball Didnt grab it just swiped it and swiped it into Cals basket suffering foul on Jonah Pierce You know Justin grabbed that last rebound Roxy hes got six on the year Hes one of Cals leading rebounders as a as a point guard I mean thats impressive Pass deflected First turnover for Pippen tonight Two on three JD Fen And hell back it out for the Blue Hose Deflected by Pippen 15 on the shot clock for Presbyterian Very good defense by Cal Cal stepping it up now You can see them trying to pressure out deny lead passes and try to force Presbyterian away from the basket And the three Parish has it blocked and Cal controls Here comes TT Carr Reedus Petritus stumbles into the lane Lost the ball and lost his footing first And heres Iverson King And you can see Presbyterian Roxy really struggling without a point guard Theyre still not sure really the point of their attack and where where they want to distribute from Theyre just kind of doing it by committee but theyre missing their point guard In the lane leaning in and a foul called is Carl Paris at third for this smart play to draw the contact Yeah there was contact Referees waiting to see if the shot went down Yeah I love the NBA but there was contact But you can see here again thats just Justin Pivven too big too strong Good defense by Cal First one missed by Carl Paris the third An 85 foul shooter Glad we didnt say anything Did it on his own And career 89 for Paris Right now you put it on him There you go one for two and the lead is two Yeah Presbyterian just using their aggressiveness trying to extend 94 ft and get Cal off their mark They have not let Cal get comfortable in the half court No theyve struggled against against this defense Chris Bell with a deep two picks up Mr Bell Hes been a little comfortable 14 for Bell No no answers yet for Chris Bell And hes carrying his hot hot hand from his trip to Manhattan against Kansas State Hes playing with a real edge offensively Tristan Wilson leans in rattles out off the window got his own miss Wilson missing again One more chance AND WILSON FINALLY GETS IT to go How about not second effort how about third effort Three times he got the rebound shot back and scored it Thats persistence Thats second effort third effort and the offensive rebounds Thats 12 for Presbyterian tonight Yeah youd have to look back and be Its been a while since a team has done that Milos Elich up and under in the key slot and its pulled down by Iverson King for the Blue Hose Oh thats impressive Chi Chiquu with the block shot Seven to shoot for Presbyterian JD Bowen Tough fade away Front rim but the offensive rebound Another one for Presbyterian And a three AND A STROKE CARL PARIS to third Timeout count guys Lets see how they respond Down one Day Aspires three Well again Roxy Cals going to find ways to score Can they now dig in defensively where they have dominated in this second half And Cals going to show a little bit of zone here Theyre going to match up talk on the perimeter bump guys off one guy on the ball not go through with cutters Theyre going to change things up a little bit see if they can get Presbyterian out of the rhythm And this is something Presbyterian struggle with against Sacramento State on Sunday No point guard Its a good time to zone JD Fen travel and get a step Yeah the zone all of a sudden shows makes you run different offensive patterns and they turn up They turn up a turnover Great call by Mark Manson Zone that court just named after Yeah the same same one that we beat Duke in the tournament too All right Got a little history there But hey you know I love to talk about uh obviously Carlos Boozer was Cameron Boozers dad I made many trips out to Alaska trying to get him Couldnt be through without him And Cameron Boozer is a terrific player Roxy just really if you havent watched him play youre in for treat Well this freshman class in college basketball is as good as weve seen in a long time As a freshman TT Carr the step back but Cal keeps it alive The fly ball the reload John rattles in a three Give me a John Camden Roxy Hes always around the action Just so smart So such a veteran player Shot fakes waits for the defender to clear and knocks down a big time three Cals going to stay in the zone and Mark Manson told us that he might Cals largest lead of the second half They led by as many as seven in the first half Iverson Kane launches rims out and over the back A foul the third on Jonah Pierce Lets look at the Its Darren Peterson There are so many brilliant freshman across college basketball this year TT Carman attack Hes cheering and applause done a good job Gets to the line Yeah Rox I think freshman today you know used to be you sit freshman a little bit you wait for him to red shirt or get his feet under him Theyre just too good and and players are really advanced uh today and they want to go in where they can play So uh you know if you havent seen Ibuka Cororey over at Stanford another fine freshman in the ACC you there are some outstanding players who are young and making their mark on college basketball One more for Simitri TT Carr who had his best game of his young Cal career at Kansas State last Thursday night I thought he played with tremendous poise and the rebound tip free and David Ames has it Thats Rita Petritus signature move Keep it alive Cal just one for five from the line And now a turnover by Ames Well they havent been there Roxy And you got to get to the line get your rhythm again Just rare that you see a Cal team not live at the free throw line Thats what they did all of last year and early this year Heres a fullcourt press Now Cal said they would go 221 back to 23 and theyve done that match up Theyve had some success last couple possessions You can see coach Frell really trying to get his team to attack the zone screen it a little bit get some easy shots Tristan Wilson floats through the key Well thats what they did Coach had to egg them on but you know its just tough Youre playing without your point guard You try attacking the zone without your point guard hard to do Season out tying 13 for Wilson Still nine and a half minutes Cal by three John Camden makes it Makes it look easy Roxy he just takes what the defense gives you They know how he can shoot it Theyre out to the threepoint line and he drives you and he pulls up and he banks it Tough tough veteran player the senior the grad transfer cheering Cal back in the zone again Theyre all over the ball now Just not a lot of openings against that zone cheering Jonah Pierce down low and Pierce trying to cross the key and Reedus Petrus the rebound trying to draw the foul Kells smart stayed on the floor Lee Dort and he dribbles it out of bounds off his leg Were going back the other way with Presbyterian Well I like the look from Carr I mean Carrs a good looking player Rox He got the ball inside to Dort Dort just a little bit in a hurry Didnt have to Hes got the size advantage They they they have trouble stopping him if he takes his time Hands of Breitus Petritus on the timer for the Blue Host And the and the Cals the zone is enabling Cal to really cover ground not foul give up not give up drives They were getting beat on the drive Theyre actually they got size on the perimeter so they can challenge and really make it tough to contest shots against Presbyterian And theyre struggling to get some easy looks Just have not had an easy look this half against the zone Yeah if youre Cal you dont want to guard an open area You want to make sure you got one guy in the ball at all times Carl Paris to third rattles out from the corner was all the way down and it popped out That was a good look Thats actually a pretty good look for Presbyterian Just didnt knock it down Same thing happened to him the other night late against Sacramento State Petrus the ball movement Lee Dort SPINS OFF THE WINDOWS FOR Dortm batched their largest lead Roxy I dont remember Lee Dorf with that left hand last year Not like hes shooting it this year Really confident using his off hand knocking down a shot off the glass Dort now with 11 You see Cal employing the zone They try to get to a guy in their area talk communicate point to each other Jones appears his foot slips Well this zone has paid off dividends for Cal I think they found something with the zone rush It worked for Sacramento State against Presbyterian on Sunday and right now its working for Cows But why is Presbyterian having problems Because you think in a zone might have a little bit more room to look at three things Roxy The the zone makes it hard Its less court space actually hard to find openings Two you know you cant designate your best shooter to get shots And three its its hard to get offensive rebounds which was plaguing Cal because now you got the bigs who are anchored at home So that zone has solved all three issues for Cal Down low to Dort off the deflection Gets it back Five to shoot Dort backs his way in And thatll be a shot clock violation but instead Presbyterian grabs it before and expires Good defensive possession Extra pass Corner three from Carl Parish to third Yeah he can shoot it He can really put the ball in the basket You cannot leave him open and hes come alive in the second half Yeah hes their designated shooter Parish with 10 of his 13 since halftime Inside 645 to play and an Eric pass Reus Petritus throws it away Yeah he thought that Justin Pippen was going to slide into an open area When you penetrate you look for the corners But watch again with the I mean the bind and the open look You cant leave him open He gets his feet set Bottoms again Presbyterian Roxy hanging in but theyve got to solve this Cal zone Theyve struggled a little bit Deep three Thats way off from Carl Paris a third clanks it off the board and the heel of the rim on the tie up is on the ground Dort and the hell ball It stays at this end with Presbyterian and dont look now but yet another call it offensive rebound A tie up albe it but you kept it alive No clean rebound by Cal Cal so hard to play against when they clean rebound and go Havent been a lot of those tonight So pesky this Presbyterian team They just get all over you and they really climb the glass 14 offensive rebounds for the Blue Hose Dort strips it from Jonah Pierce out of bounds underneath Yeah he wanted the foul call and coach coach said Hey keep playing Hes not buying it And he said hes getting tough on his players I love it Saying Hey stop complaining Officials take it up strong Youll get the call Kells playing the zone out of bounds under two Theyre going to employ the two three Heres Pierce and the push shot from inside the foul line by Jonah Pierce Yeah Kell didnt play the two three inside out They kind of widened out with their with their guards Left the free throw lane area open Twopoint game 6 minutes to go Chris Bell in the lane Bell spins out and the rebound tracked down by Josh Picket for Presbyterian Heartbreak for Bell He thought he had that too cheering Cal in the zone Theyre going to stay with it Just when you thought Cal was getting some separation and answer from Presbyterian Well again they can tie or take the lead with a three cheering Dont look now Iverson King goes inside Well challenged by Lee Dort Yeah he wanted to contact wanted the foul didnt get it But the play of verticality Dor had his position went straight up Now he did a much better job showing the officials his body and his position Justin Pippen and a foul will get Pippen to the line as he made a quick first step down the lane You see there a really good job by Lee Dort He just straight jumped straight up straight down Extended his six 10 frame Made it really tough to get that score off Three points now for Pippen with six assists And one more for Pippen who is a 79 foul shooter on the young season You know Cals got the luxury of adjusting Pippen and a Dayday Ames to be able to get to the basket create for themselves to get to the foul line or their teammates That didnt barely hit the room Uncharacteristic there and uncharacteristic Couch is two for seven from the line tonight Travel extra step for Carl Paris at third Yes thats what happens Rox Talk about court space you get in the paint theres always a man and a half in the zone You cant go oneonone because the minute you beat your man theres another defender And that really you know that really spooks players I mean it makes it harder You got to be really precise You cant go all the way Cal definitely wants to get on the board here and see if they can separate with under five to go Tracked down by John Cam Still lots of time to shoot Camden before he went up for the shot and a push on Iverson King of Presbyterian And he was determined to draw a foul I mean he just kept the ball in his hands He knew he was being guarded oneonone He said You cannot guard me without fouling me And thats exactly what happened Sixth team foul on the Blue Hose There it is Swan put into the bonus There it is Heres Pippen to the bucket Pippen foul to the rim The force Did he just try to dunk that over the top Allah He did His dad My goodness Lets watch this again Theres Justin Pippen Said Im going to try to go over the top of you He tried to punch it on a 610 guy Well why not Two shots for Pippen Four and a half minutes to go Tight ball game Youre Quinton Frell How do you play it with Jonah Pierce just picked up his fourth foul Im going to sit him to the through the TV timeout after that timeout I You got to have your best players on the floor if they want to win this game Theres no decision making You cant hope it goes in overtime You know they just lost a game down the stretch You need your best players on the floor But Im okay with waiting for the timeout TV timeout Foul by four Pippen goes one for two PIPPEN STEALS IT cheering FOR CALIFORNIA YEAH And and coach Frell just said Look thats an unforced turnover Theyre playing a zone You cant turn it over against the zone And he was an excellent point guard himself You just cant do that Here is Camden down the lane and a foul on Iverson King And John Camden will head to the stripe He seems to know every play to make when to give it up when to keep in his hands and hes commanding a lot of attention but you have a John Camden on your team hes going to give you some an edge down the stretch of a game And even hes missing free throws Thats his first miss of the year He was 10 for 10 Theres not an earthquake here is there Down in this last night Thats true Or the early this morning technically You felt that No I was in Southern California How come I didnt feel it Must be a deep sleep Not really Camden goes one for two Heres again Cal extending Theyre going to extend and theyll go back in the zone and theyve had success doing this 5651 California Tristan Wilson had a good look and Lee Dort saves it from going out and Cal controls Well again the advantage of having Lee Dor by the basket in the zone is paying off because hes able to secure that rebound Thats why team zone Cals gone about four minutes without a main field goal but theyre defending in the post Lee Dort backs his way in Dort cuts it cheering Well Cals now getting some easier scores Roxy theyve struggled now to put some points on the board but fortunately theyve played good enough defense to make it tough enough for Presbyterian And theyve their largest lead again Spinning inside and the left hand in the roll for Jaylen Peterson Yeah I like that move by Peterson He stayed patient got it over the top Here comes Pippen Well if youre Cal you dont have to be in a hurry You got the lead You got to get the best shot you can You cant play giveaway And I put it in this mans hands right here RIGHT TO THE BASKET CANDID AND ONE for John Camden Must have hurt us Rox The John Camden with the goto move Game is on the line I call it Give me the ball John Camden to the basket with in this game with all five starters averaging in double figures And John Camden has taken over this second half He has been the one reason on the offensive end that Cal has turned this around and the zone You cant say enough about the zone Its really made a difference for Cal defensively Largest lead of the night for Cal and Camden with 14 of his 16 in the second half Carl Paris the third glides in Lee Dort swatted it Yeah you see no easy no easy looks And Parish is still down Thats why we have the stoppage as Justin Shamian one of our officials making sure that Carl Parish the third is okay after a hard fall Good piece of officiating to stop the action You got possession Wasnt an advantage there but you have to check on a player thats gotten hit to the head area Good job by the officials Yeah I think he just The knee went right into the head Thats tough Josh Picket drives and a foul and Pickicket will get to the line here with 211 to play Well thats pretty good action when you screen the outside of the zone It makes the opposite wing come up and guard but that also allows some openings inside They were able to get all the way to the rim Good call by coach Frell to get his players to attack now Not settle from the perimeter Just passing it on the perimeter Second foul on Lee Dort cheering And it rattles out Josh Picket now two for three at the line this season These are big free throws This could narrow it to a two possession game You need these Transfer from cheering Denver native of Planefield Illinois Chicago area Approaching two minutes to play Cal looking to go to four and one if they can finish off Presbyterian The pass deflected the hands from Picket and its picked up by Carl Paris at third Tristan Wilson He had a really good look and D rips the rebound down for Cal That would have cut it to a two possession game Big miss and big rebound for Cal Now they can really take some time off the clock Youve got Ames and you got Pippen Two guys that arent going to turn it over very often Theyre going to milk the clock down and see if they can get some time off Heres Pippen and he gets a timeout with seven on the shot clock and 125 to play A heady play by Justin Pippen because he was trapped no outlets and he called the timeout Good play Well talk about it Mark Manson and his music staff get to draw one up Probably switch ball screens Here is Pippen Justin Pippen The lob for Lee Dort down low And Dort Camden fouled on a put back and well get to the line What hasnt he done this half If youre the Cal Bears you have to be thankful John Camdens come to play today Its actually a pretty good drop off here just got it got it off the glass But John Camdens been everywhere tonight Just everywhere Foul was on Jonah Pierce He has fouled out now as he had an really impactful first half Not as much a factor in the second half Pierce fouls out with 13 the senior And John Camden will shoot two cheering One more for Camden Thats what I and now holds the lead at nine for California 221 again Back to 23 Timeout by Presbyterian to not a lot of time left Maybe play the foul game or at least try to to get something going but theyre playing against the zone Trace the third travel Yeah not a lot of space Thats again the advantage of the zone You get by one defender youve got two or three more standing there waiting for you I thought they had a chance to get a couple of quick shots off but Cals size and their their their length really bothered Presbyterian whos quite a bit smaller 63 seconds to go 6354 Calcourt pressure from Presbyterian Justin Pippen will bring it up Not a lot of not not a lot of options if youre Presbyterian to foul Play the foul game Cals got too many good free throw shooters Camden drives Camden to the rim Camden goes crashing and a foul is called as Iverson King called for a block He was in the restricted area and was not the primary defender Hes called for the foul No thats just a smart play Even though Camden lost control of the ball but he knew he had to get to the rim and he went all the way there and you can see the defenders feet just on the inside of that line Dont think John Camden music was going to make that shot but he did what he had to do He drew the foul Hes done a great job getting his team to the foul line almost singlehandedly One more for Camden 397 to go and a 10point California lead Yeah Vita Petritus in here on the defensive end You know he can scrap Cal doesnt want to take any chances They want to get plenty defensive stop here and put this game away All of a sudden you look up and Camdens got 20 and 18 since halftime The floater And thats short from Josh Picket kept alive by the Blue Hose and a turnover by Presbyterian And its academic now Now the zone again for set turnover because you have to get out further on the floor You have to get to open areas differently than the man Roxy You play against the zone You got to find open areas on the floor where to dribble it and where to pass it and where to station yourself You cannot station yourself with a defender between you and the ball Cal gets it across Candon looking to attack and some miscommunication to lob from Lee Dort and Presbyterian back the other way Call Paris to third A transition three timeout Well Mark Manson not had the eve of the 128 big game Good time to come out and watch some basketball against the pressure lobed into the front court by Candon Lee George behind the defense and the strike to close it out Thatll do it 6757 Cal with the win
