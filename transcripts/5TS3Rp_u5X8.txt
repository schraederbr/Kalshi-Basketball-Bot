Teddy Valentine Lee Cassell AJ decides to officiate our game and were off and running inside the Dome and as his customary the fans will stand until the orange scores its first basket thats excellent defense right off the right off the Jump Justin mutts big strong physical guy he feels like hes been in college forever Tom but that excellent decision maker in the middle of that offense as well mutts gets a soft bounce and it drops in for the first points of the game Applause thank you Matsu averages just over 13 points per game and eight rebounds consistent production from The Experience mutts free from the corner is all net propels Chris Bell one of the emerging freshmen has good size right at six seven good length really active on the bottom line of that zone 21st three of the season for Bell fight for the loose ball and mince youll run it down theyll shoot 36 from Beyond The Arc the Orange is a team right on that same number immense with a fancy dribble nowhere to go he has to give it up Edwards trying to work on the glass had it wrestled Away by MJ Collins MJ Collins The Freshman having to step in and play added minutes with Hunter Couture missing with an injury coach young said it he does the things that I need him to do as a freshman he defends he doesnt turn the ball up over its been a pleasant surprise for the Hokies so far this year a loss Saturday at home against NC State for Virginia Tech most recently a spinning mutts deep into the shot clock pretty interesting setup get the ball to mutts in the middle and Syracuse is not a team thats going to collapse at the freethrow line months has a oneonone situation against the bigger Edwards excellent move turning away from Edwards finishing with the left hand Applause Gerard and Edwards send it back out shot clocks at 10 Music mince takes a peek at that shot clock steps back Edwards over the top of basily in a foul is called but purposely is going to have to be good you have to box out prior to the ball hitting the rim and doing a nice job there is basili time now for our keys to the game and theyre brought to you by your local Ford dealer one thing to look at as the game goes on Syracuse causes a lot of turnovers whenever Joe diments judament excuse me gets out in transition hes almost impossible to stop take care of the basketball get a shot on every possession if youre Syracuse youve got to attack the cup early its Virginia Tech attacking the cup and what a pass by mutts as he found Brazilian under the basket excellent decision maker is mutts if you need 20 he can get you 20 but he is the pull from of this Virginia Tech offense Applause this is mints and the paint hadnt spotted away Maddox denying mints Applause Gerard difficult shot and he hit him away how about the pass prior to the shot Edwards didnt even bother catching over two hands tips into Gerard gets him in a closeout situation Gerard can score that way inside outside just terrific touch Brazilian side against two Defenders another pass by much what happens he makes quick decisions and thats what you get when you play with an older player like mutts hes got two masters degree in undergrad degrees working on his second undergrad degree you get a veteran player in the middle of that zone you can find Opportunities around the rim silly is the second leading scorer on this Virginia Tech Team pushed over 13 points per game Bell trying to create some space and its an offensive foul and Jay Collins good position well getting a little over eager to continue to move that basketball Syracuse not typically a high assist team but at the same time they have guys that can make some plays Bell well need to go straight up he didnt need to push off youre athletic enough to finish over the top at 67 launching from long distance Applause team has got the rebound hes in there number 55 in white Music Gerard at 14 second half points against Virginia that little Runner bounces out Rodney rice taking the ball up the court his first game of the season for Virginia Tech top 100 kid but basilis a little Lefty hook over the top nice move by the Wright State transfer theyve been waiting on Rodney rice who found bazilly that offseason ankle surgery and the Freshman singing his first action tonight he and mince played AAU ball together thats right played for team Durant at the eybl peach jam two years ago excellent combination is mitz is an absolute always in attack mode always in attack mode come on that series of moves and fakes one thing you have to love if youre a player what a

the wave of Syracuse freshman this season second leading scorer on the team just under 16 per game I love this graphic The Qs youths and theres a lot of them Malik Brown a shot blocker Off the Bench theyve got a lot of young Talent thats going to continue to develop to develop within this offense Syracuse theres a lot to look forward to as the seasons go on problem is now you got to keep them right Tom thats true thats thats the issue thats the issue 107 Virginia Tech has the lead on the road their lone win here at the Dome came in 2020 Bell straight away front rim to Doula able to track it down led the way with 19 points and losing effort against NC State last Saturday hes a good four or five feet behind the line still within range there Terence I I think he certainly is because he was an excellent shooter but thats a shot that you can get towards the end of the shot clock you do want to take some of those at the same time let the ball work a little bit youre getting whatever you want on the inside the Ole misses Lynn Kidd has come into the game pulls down that board from Virginia Tech interesting to see Rodney rice hes going to play some point guards slide Padula over to the two spot Bryce got excellent size College ready frame as a freshman really good player turn around for much a little strong officials are talking about it Ted Valentine emphatically says were going to keep it at this end of the floor not the most popular decision from the Hall of Famer thats an area it was off of Virginia Tech you can uh go ahead and look at that one it was very close we had the benefit of Replay obviously thats exactly right but thats a point of emphasis heads up coming our way coming our way I was ready to shoot that I know youre always ready to shoot from what I hear youre always ready but thats a point of emphasis uh if youre Syracuse in that two three Zone sometimes its difficult to match up in order to block out and rebound they are susceptible on the glass Virginia Tech keeps throwing it to the free throw line this time they fumble it out of bounds its a ball that earlier in the game the zilli hes doing a nice job of taking in and finishing Lynn Kidd the young big man needs to have his hands ready to go NCAA tournament the last two seasons for Mike young in Virginia Tech and the steal by rice Maddox and Maddox was fouled that one bounced out thatll drive you crazy but Rodney rice wasting no time making an impact with the steal theyre off and running thats team Durant on team Duran Maddox thats when you need to finish and get the extra and get the extra point daddy rice was a nice player in high school started a little bit had ankle surgery in August somebody who can run your team can score when you need him to but just another big Guard from that DC DMV area that can orchestrate your offense Mikey on really high on the young man getting thrown right in the ACC competition perhaps with Couture on the bench and again its timetable for Couture not exact just yet but theyre trying to Target next Wednesday when they play Virginia they do not have a weekend game for the Hokies coming up so well see if thats enough time for Couture to rejoin the lineup Turn Around from Gerard and that bounces out hes missed his last several shots of a similar Style Applause once again that entry to mutts finds kid got a defender in the air and then Edwards came over the top and a foul is called I thought he had a lot of ball but at the same time excellent entry pass Justin Motz getting the ball on that high post makes a quick decision direct passes against this Zone and you can do some damage I think it was a clean block by Edwards but Chris Bell getting him with the body so Bell picks up the foul kid to the freethrow line Virginia Tech is a team 74 percent fifth of the ACC so Bell will leave Justin Taylor comes in Bell to the bench another one threepointer to open the game Sorry Sorry uh Justin Taylor doing an ex hes done an excellent job this season being ready to shoot another perimeter guy reminds me a little bit of a slightly shorter Matt Harper computer plays with an edge big strong body nice player underneath foul and buckets Malik Brown for the orange Malik Brown maintaining his patience from the Blue Ridge School a lot of good ACC players came from that school and hes going to have an excellent career with the orange men gets in front of monts hold his position thats an excellent finish Applause round of the freethrow line not a whole lot of experience there six of 13 on the season drops that one in Lake Brown incredibly long arms on the bottom of that 23 Zone the Blue Ridge school as I alluded to Amir Sims former all ACC player for Clemson mamadi Di aquite now in the NBA in Padula for three to each side and thats an easy board for Brown freshman from Culpepper Virginia Edwards my goodness Jesse Edwards pulled it out of the clouds an excellent pass and finish by the big fella Virginia Tech hasnt made a field going over three minutes until that shot by mucks good things happen when you get Justin mutts the ball its that simple hes their saddle down guy every really good team that youre going to play against has one guy that once he gets the basketball everybody else relaxes around him Hunter Couture is that guy a little bit on the perimeter but Justin mutts he gets it at the top of the key hes an excellent decision maker OT picked up the foul big time pass Joe Gerard in the Finish Jesse Edwards the camera did not do this man Justice I mean what a great look from behind the backboard hey entry into Edwards again and he got fouled to the free throw line Edwards Applause Jesse Edwards he just gradually improved from year to year during his time playing for Syracuse but look catches the ball keeps it up high Poteet just a little too late coming over on help side Edwards nice touch around the basket so Edwards at the freethrow line 68 percent of the season old school threepoint play Jesse Edwards Applause and she was as you see the gradual increase in production a lot of it has to do with confidence a lot of it has to do with him getting in the weight room Tom from year to year overcoming that wrist injury from the season ago that limited his action and youre trying to run the floor again to make eye contact with Joe Gerard Applause threepointer Justin Taylor forget about it Justin Taylor excellent body control and Body Balance going up into his shot thats one thing with freshman not always the most disciplined when getting those opportunities excellent balance and finish 60 run by the orange interrupted by a three from Padula once again well behind the line said what you can do sir I can do better hes able to get one to fall was just one of three on threepointers that attempt by Edwards at The Rim popped out Vince able to gather it against rice and words down low he found the open man in Brown so Brown gets to hustle offensive rebound and then gets rewarded at the end of the play you love to see it with a young player trying to do the little things threepoint game and maybe we should expect a close game down the stretch Syracuse averages 746 points Virginia Tech averages 743 points on the body of work for the season well I will say this if the Hokies continue to score in the high post at least Syracuse keeps them off the threepoint line which is where they thrive but at the same time getting high quality looks Gerard is now one of five from the floor brazily who had the last bucket for Virginia Tech leads all scorers with eight pajula again a good five feet behind the line Gerard tried to send it in there to Brown and getting knocked out of bounds Syracuse basketball Jesse Edwards goes up for the flush but just struggles to put it through but its the extra effort by The Freshman Malik Brown getting out he gets rewarded at the end of the play Syracuse up one no matter who you root for we can all

Hunter Couture injured four games ago against Boston College hit that left elbow awkwardly on the court and hes a player who shoots 40 percent from Beyond The Arc but has missed the last four games with the elbow injury directly coincides with their fourgame losing streak and theres a reason for that he was terrific we talk about 31 points you saw it on the graphic there at 31 points in the ACC Championship game that was about as good a display in the ACC Championship game as Ive seen in my lifetime uh just really terrific coming off the screens hes the teams best defender and kind of a settled down guy Edwards Banks it in for the orange seven points now for Edwards really impressed with Edwards you know you try you see some of it on film these big man got soft hands and obviously he makes a huge presence on the defensive end able to stop mutts from attacking the rim he rejoins The Fray pass deflected out of bounds from Torrance well stay with the orange block down on that end but Edwards you see his wingspan I mean flat impressive in the middle of that zone but if youre active you can have success Justin mutts picking it up on the defensive end great pass inside outside rice Applause how impressive has he been a steal that leads out in transition its his first game in college I dont see the nerves Tom and that is truly unique I mean ready to go from the jump impact freshman for the hokers Taylor weather for the orange now Torrance shot clock at 10 back out to Taylor thats a three easy board Padula Applause Padula fifth in the ACC just over 17 points per game rice in the corner Gerard getting ready to check back into the orange the Doula for three and its all net and it all comes down to the Past did you see the ball faked by Rodney rice fake to shoot brings Justin Taylor up leaves the corner wide open thats a high IQ play by The Freshman who quite frankly Tom we didnt know what to expect how nervous he would be come in and done well early two of seven on threepointers for Virginia Tech this is Taylor another three attempt and it rattles around and goes down soft touch strong body extends High the Finish is nice Justin Taylor from the state of Virginia made his way to Syracuse who had a triple double in a winning effort Castle Coliseum and Blacksburg a season ago against the orange that was a driving for Bula he wants the basket Virginia Tech the lid starting to come off from three Padula he knocks one down look at the fake though fake up find the corner knock it through Sean fatula keeping Virginia Tech going Music Music to be a

military community and their families Music foreign Music Music Music Sports South presented by your local Ford dealer its a onepoint lead for the orange with 7 43 to go in our first half from the Dome first of three straight road games for Virginia Tech coming off four straight losses and so far Padula a couple of threepointers for Virginia Tech he hasnt been shy I think thats one thing for certain but if on the two makes that Sean badou has been able to knock through the ball has popped around the perimeter ball moves takes his time steps right into it sometimes against the Syracuse Zone you get trapped into thinking hey Im wide open right away if that ball moves a little bit it makes easier shots for you Rodney rice this was a great ball fake and pass to Sean pagula who catches it in Rhythm and is able to knock it through take your time be patient with against this 23 defense and youre going to be able to find shots but dont settle for it in the first 10 12 seconds of the shot clock because youre going to get those same shots later 33 made threes on the season for Padula to lead the team its time to be silly because start the night Virginia Tech basketball is the leading scorer hes got eight not in the game right now for Virginia Tech pneumatics had the shot altered Torrance runs it up Justin Taylor an excellent contest on the perimeter if youre going to ball screen the top of that zone you better get a piece of him because if you cant create any advantage theyre just going to stay put excellent defensive possession by the orange and three pass Edwards could not calculate the angle Brown came over the top had a chance at it Maddox brings it up Virginia Tech up over 50 percent shooting in this first half its above their season average of 47 still third best in the ACC poked away from mutts Malik Browns just staying active on the bottom nice move and then Syracuse can play with some pace Lawrence Edwards Lux was there bounces around a padulo he puts a move on Gerard and then stumbles to the court clean play a lot of contact Now Syracuse is off and running this is when theyre dangerous Taylor stop bounce Justin Taylor showing he can put it on the deck a little bit Tom nice move doesnt lose his feet nice finish so Taylors got eight points now kid if Taylor can be that third option and play Within himself to knock down shots I mean thats a huge addition beside Gerard and Metz just two points for Gerard so far one of five shooters a couple of Threes for Taylor and that one bounces away from Edward shot clock is at seven Gerard wants it Padula on the hip driving it and scoring to Gerard Applause what stands out most about Joe Gardens is patience keep all fakes he plays off his jump shot nice move that little floater hes had in his game since high school terrific Big Time flush Lynn Kidd Ing and a one possession game as we close in on five minutes to go in the first half quick passes no deflections get the ball where it needs to go quick against that zone you can find Opportunities Gerard has not attempted a three in this game does lead the team with 49 made threes this season shot clock is inside a 10 again for Torrance Marquette transfer doesnt over exert himself on the offensive end has good body size and quickness to create when needed Torrance the Syracuse native its a bucket for the orange Gerard the quick close on Padula off of Edwards how about that thats not something LinkedIn has had in his game all that long were going to get a timeout Virginia Tech Lynn kid impressive on the last two possessions for the Hokies hes been terrific a little ball fake into playing within himself BT staying within three at Hardees no matter what you choose its the right choice because our new four for six deal lets you

today theyve been quick theyve been decisive in their actions and Justin mutts has for the 10 assists for the Hokies sharing the ball well and in their wins theyve taken care of the basketball in terms of assistive turnover ratio and today much more of the same so far last four games and we talk about it its coincided with Hunter Couture not being in the game and Sean Padula has a lot on his plate as the lead guard for this Hokies team with Couture out of the game he cant really take a breather thats why the addition of Rodney rice in this lineup has been so valuable four assists for mutts in the game tonight coach Mike Youngs team averages just under 10 turnovers per game because he stalks that sideline intensity on that hokey sideline and bench area trailing 3128 kicked around foul coming up against Virginia Tech and I think its going to be on mutts with a push underneath Syracuse really active on the offensive glass hasnt necessarily been a strength of theirs but today the Links bothering Virginia Tech a little bit a lot of activity in the paint from these teams 1816 the lead for the orange kid defending on Edwards out of bounds and it stays with Syracuse slim lead in the paint Syracuse bench has 15 points seven for that Virginia Tech bench needs our first look at number one Rodney rice Baylor part of the big bench production thats right Roddy rise been good early Taylors been excellent a good defensive possession Sean Padula staying in front needs to shoot at the end of the clock for Taurus and it bounces in its a three ball for the orange looking back back at his bench I got it too number 10 for juice the hometown kid four of eight is a team on threes Applause Syracuse really shooting it well Virginia Techs had success as long as they get it to mutts he passes it some he finishes over the top thats something that Syracuse is going to live with because that keeps Virginia takes threepoint shooting at May theyre having to live with a tough 15foot floater so for Torrance on that last trip down just his sixth May three of the season Music fourpoint lead they try to get it to Edwards off the bounce Im curious to know what this call is were going to have a foul on the way up but that pass I thought it was an excellent shift by number one Rodney rice defensively on the backside youll see him come over number one comes in chips it doesnt matter Jesse Edwards just a big man throws it off the backboard and he gets the foul on the elbow Edwards at the free throw line well we have a moment lets get a message from Coyote Tractor my experience if you work the land youve got to be a jack of all trades you got to have a little bit of optimism and a whole lot of getgo Applause 68 shooter from the line Jesse Edwards Applause right now he is the leading scorer for the orange exactly three minutes to go kid back out to Padula thank you long rebound bounces the Maddox Applause mugson Kidd try to collaborate three Defenders there for the orange and it doesnt stop the kid Lynn Kidd doesnt stop the kid well done Tom thank you it doesnt stop the kid shows great composure he gets the ball in balls batted around a little bit finishes as a month finishes among the trees link kid playing well early he had 14 points in that loss Saturday against NC State trying to keep it rolling coming off of that Virginia Tech bench here in the first half 220 to go Padula took it away and then Edwards committed the foul Applause Virginia Tech continues pass the ball at a high level again who else Justin mutts finds the man doesnt get it on the first try but this was a big time finish playing well early so Virginia Tech is a team 52 from the floor two of eight on threes and they both belong to Padula they still both belong to Padula after the rice Miss Taylor and bezilla get tangled up its going to be on Brazilian I dont love that call I felt like the silly got inside had his hand on the ball called a little bit late but regardless balls still moving at a high level Syracuse just hitting shots Syracuse hasnt settled either that was one of our keys of the game only nine threes attempted most of which have been opened 16 fouls for both teams now continues to tick inside of two minutes Taylor Scoops up the loose ball shot clock now at seven Applause I mean his ability long strides attacking the rim doesnt need that many dribbles and the smooth finger roll finish Philly in a crowd Doula dribbles around the Defenders and puts an action on that one off the backboard the English by Sean Padula Gerard thatll fall count the basket and foul as brazily hit the court and a little bit of that right there Sean patula if youre going to go for the steal you better get it because you open up the defense for Gerard to attack we know hes a bucket goes for the steal now you leave the rim open not able to get in front proper position Big Time finish Joe Gerard hes had a lot of big time finishes with Syracuse career 42 of 48 from the freethrow line for Gerard and the Miss 87 percent season for Gerard second best of the ACC a rarity there at the free throw line kid in a congested area Hema was there so is Taylor thats on Hema you have to stay vertical you have enough help around that Baseline and now Virginia Tech in a one and one good aggressiveness by kid trying to finish Jim behind I havent seen him happy that often Tom and you went to Syracuse so Im going to ask you uh youve seen the man happy outside of a national champion hes a happy guy Im sure he is but when you get in the intensity of ACC basketball 47 years player and an assistant coach power to that from Lions New York nearby a legend in the game I say all of that Jacobs essentially but a legend of the game terrific coach hes had a lot of really good players over the years so were into the final minute now the first half both teams have shot it well both over 50 percent mints fancy dribbling leading into Maddox Paxton well to hold his ground shot clock at five Gerard for three and hes ripping the ropes for the orange come on a little hesitation and a finish Joe Gerard he has that isolation scoring ability hes caught fire a little bit here in the first half his 50th made three of the season eight point lead orange final seconds Virginia Tech in possession Applause lets throw a ball screen on the outside or just an attack by match got fouled on the shot so Maddox will go to the freethrow line thats a four decision Hema you have to stay straight up and down thats three fouls on the young man hes an excellent shot blocker but you have to understand whats your contestant right Maddox fading away off the dribble away from a sevenfooter you can contest straight up and down thats going to be a hard enough shot as it is just a few ticks left on the clock Applause Maddox a big time shooter from Beyond The Arc right at 10 again but hes hit some big rims 90 free throw shooter on the season Maddox Applause off the backboard and no good so theres your halftime count Applause 43s 37 its a lead for the orange they are 71 this season when they have the halftime lead and theyve got it in the dome against the visiting Virginia Tech Hokies from five percent right before half Syracuse playing well offensively Falls in play for the second half Virginia Tech 52 percent shooting the orange up near 55 percent in that first half here we go with the second 20 minutes mutts lost the handle momentarily got it back and a crowd tapped away got it back again medulla up against Edwards butzilla comes over the top and Edwards second leading rebounder and the ACC comes down with it for the orange good defensive possession to open up four cues and that lets Miss try to get downhill thats a quality defensive possession Mr Maddox thats his area Edwards led the way with the nine points of the first half tied with his teammate Joe Gerard hit a three late in the score of nine shooting Benny Williams sitting on that bench next to his Hall of Fame coach this is Gerard finds some space and drops it and thats over the top of five hands but silly getting out contestant High sometimes Gerard he gets in this mood its like he doesnt even see anybody in front of him tough shot and finish Gerard double digits 10 games in a row now Edwards the rebound its hard not to be impressed with Jesse Edwards his length his hands Bell from the corner and bring it up its Syracuses offense all impressive today just like that the orange for their largest lead inside brazily from mutts quick passes no deflections high low run to perfection Gerard looking for the range from three and mutts as the rebound thats the first shot all game Tom that Gerard took off balance hes constantly off balance does a terrific job there take monks couldnt convert the other end but take your time the ball is finding you maintain good balance that gets deflected out of bounds near the Syracuse bench they keep possession so mutts now four of eight from the floor he shoots 58 on the season third in the ACC for mutts again he had the triple double last year in Blacksburg in the winning effort for Virginia Tech Syracuse leads the overall series 116 71 in the dome Edwards tough catch may have earned some free throws in the process it wasnt just was it just Edwards Elite Brown catches it is able to Dish off quick nice play by The Freshman gets it quick decision nice little Lefty pass you have to stay straight up and change your verticality stay away from picking up that foul but Jesse Edwards Tom has been really good so far tonight 611 center from Amsterdam benevolence Syracuse with the advantage on the boards 2214 with Edwards at the free throw line Edwards played at BC Apollo in Amsterdam his brother played at UNC not North Carolina Northern Colorado got it so thats a big one and his brother currently plays at Malia and second division Spain Malias in Africa on the coast of Tunisia geography lesson so hey here I actually got to play in that town pay attention youve played internationally quite a bit Bell trying to save it mint scraps he took it away from mince from mutts and mids has it mutts to mince to 50 50 balls are going to Syracuse to start this second half long journey got a uh officials time out thats Bell shaking up in the corner hes going to trot over to the orange bench Im not quite sure what happened he came over try to save a ball I think he hit his leg Taylors going to come in for him see but Jesse Edwards once again look at that wingspan Tom are you kidding me its a good save I think he fell off the edge of the floor maybe twisted his ankle looked like it was a right ankle situation jog off the floor though so it seems to be like hell be fine Vince put the ball in the rim Edwards went up and there was a foul against Virginia Tech oh I gotta scuff that Shin a little bit as Bellas on that sideline taking a look at him sometimes youre not always rewarded with Hustle Bell with the booboo if you will looking for brown on the inside and now mints this is so on Maddox drops it in with a little Scoop from Mintz slow to fast fast to slow hurt your jerk style of game and hes so smooth with the basketball all the way to one hand finish over Maddox impressive thats why hes scoring so many points best freshman in the country its Jude immense Fantastic look from right behind that backboard and mince finishes off the old school threepoint play orange now 5239 Applause impressive performance in the opening minutes of the second half Syracuse which held the halftime lead the Doula trying to get the Hokies back in this one mutts over the top foul against Virginia Tech we got a push in the back but this is the difference this year between this years Syracuse team and last year Syracuse team right Rodney rice tries to penetrate off the top of the key to find somebody on the wing but Doula has to shoot over Malik Brown who must have a seven foot wingspan their athleticism on the bottom wings of that zone are what the big difference is this year between Syracuse really performing well early Edwards just to Circle back Gerard tires away Joe Gerard he gets his feet set hes on balance forget about it Tom forget about it Joe Gerard hes found his rhythm he gets the people going here at Syracuse New York finishes over the top Jesse Edwards working off the ball finds him

orange 50 percent shooting in this game mutts Poteet off the hands and collected by the orange driving Gerard followed Brown that bounced out somehow off the back iron and heres rice Music might be the only mistake the Browns made today he started the second half medulla launches for him but Brown has been terrific there was a reason he started in the second half Vinnie Williams going to come off the bench for brown his link his athleticism his presence around the rim been really good watch out foreign s activity off the ball nice set crossscreen action Justin Taylor putting it on a dime

shooting but now 714 for Gerard and 17 points so hes going to lead everybody with that number along the Baseline kid diving after it its out of bounds to the orange Applause take a look at the scoreboard all of a sudden Terence 20point lead for the orange happened quick I mean it certainly happened quick and turnovers rearing their ugly head here in the second half for Virginia Tech and thats Syracuse Zone makes everything you do pause half a second off and what a pass forget about it Malik Brown the tip dunk his activity has turned this game up Malik Brown has been terrific Vasily at the other end for a rim Bender for the Hokies those large about six feet behind the line which is 22 feet one and three quarter inches away Doula in traffic it was further than that his shot was way behind the line I mean really five or six feet at least Im a big fan of the heat check Tom but Im a bigger fan of tip dunks by Malik Brown that was a big time finish and everything just takes an extra second the balls not moving crisply those passes need to be sharp its just not moving like it did in the first half Justin mutts a little bit out of sorts and you can tell from the body language a little bit frustrated in this second half as we tick down to 12 minutes to go Virginia Tech with six turnovers in the last four minutes or so more points for the orange he is a tough shot maker Jude immense I dont know how he gets it above his head sometimes the Doula stumbled somehow got it back to Rice Wing jumper Music Applause a lot of contact and what happens Syracuse gets to walk it back up they are playing full of confidence the orange had lost at home to Pittsburgh late December and then beat Boston College here at the Dome went on the road January 3rd beat Louisville and the loss on Saturday at Virginia so two and two in their last four Taylors Fall Away weak side mutts now we told you Virginia Tech had lost its last four by five points or less right now its not looking like thats going to be the result they need a very quick comeback must be silly easy too and thats how you get started thats right butt needs to be a little bit more aggressive attacking that five man before getting rid of it whenever he does that the defense converges and then hell be able to find a couple of passes around the basket but playing on his heels a little bit at that freethrow line whenever he catches it orange have been dominant the Dome against Virginia Tech thats going to be mince putting the shoulder down for the offensive foul and thats a cool thats a good job Padula

forget theres more ACC action coming up nine Eastern Hunter Tyson and the Clemson Tigers trying to move to 60 at the top of the standings in the ACC and theyll take on the Louisville Cardinals thats coming up a Little John Coliseum Clemson South Carolina Terence you know that area well dont you I live in the upstate I live in the upstate no theres not a player playing better right now than Hunter Tyson its not just the last four games he has shot 43 from Beyond the arc on the season and you have a four man that can do that really spaces out the floor so thats coming up nine Eastern 60 would be the first time in school history its an ACC play for the Clemson program led by head coach Brad Brownell 133 overall Miami Hurricanes their only loss was in Atlanta against Georgia Tech Florida State defeated Georgia Tech on Saturday for Leonard Hamiltons 600th career win and Tony Bennett has become the alltime leader in wins at Virginia as well and they got to win yesterday against North Carolina 10 and a half minutes to go in our game at the Dome Tom wormy Terence Oglesby in our outstanding ACC basketball production crew with you basilia another Jam that all starts Sean Padula packing that Wing Gap and then it sets off a change of a chain of reactions to Philly nice finish Music Edwards trying to establish some position inside mints weaving his way foreign S at the other end not quite enough to tip but zilly was in the vicinity CJ Collins out and running I thought there was contact there but Padula hes out for the steals in Virginia Tech desperately trying to generate some momentum those are plays you need to have if youre going to get back into this ball game Tom the Doula trying to make something happen in the anticipation Applause oh Music Applause nine and a half minutes to go in our second half Gerard trying to create space offensive foul its an excellent job Gerard getting out or excuse me Collins getting out in front taking his charge to remotes well you want to stay tuned for the fast break its presented by your local Ford dealer fast break is coming up Applause its been a fast half for the orange its like Coach Boeheim wants to call a timeout Applause to gather his team that was a good defensive possession NJ Collins Mike young talked about his defensive ability as a freshman whenever youre stepping in you got to do the things that you can control control the things that you can control MJ Collins doing that doing a nice job of that defensively but Virginia Tech just really struggling here in the second half to generate open looks both from Beyond The Arc and inside the arc bazilly leads the way only hokey in double digits with 10 hes had a couple of dunks here in the second half and the problem is if youre not shooting it well from the perimeter you got to run into Jesse Edwards if you get inside the perimeter so that makes things infinitely more difficult leading shot Blocker in the ACC 14 in white Im intrigued to see what Edwards is able to do at the next level because he poses a lot of things that NBA Scouts and NBA Personnel like long soft hands lob threat but hes been in a zone for a while and not saying thats a bad thing but you got to see the man going trying to defend mutts he earned some free throws but he certainly has the ability much though thats a strong undersized floor man just attacking the body first two for mutts mutts started out off the game terrific I mean he was passing the ball he was in that high post he was knocking down shots right at the ACC but at the same time hes been asked to do a lot four turnovers on the game to go along with those 10 points now and seven assists but hes relied on a lot for this team Muncie the third leading scorer for Virginia Tech behind Padula and basily and Virginia Tech has responded with an 80 run trying to cut into the orange League put as big as 22 for Syracuse its out in front and that pass deflected away but zilly takes it whats on the Run a twoman game with brazily Miller had it for a second rice gets it back hes open zilly had the position and the foul coming up on Brown the zillys effort is helping things off helping things out but Sean badul on the other end really defending at a high level Rodney rice gives it up but kazilley really staying consistent in his efforts Malik Brown a little bit too much over the best Taylor comes out for the orange eight points for Taylor Music mutts on the glass and mutts got it done and thats where you can get back in this ball game intense defensively and on the offensive glass is where Syracuse is Success susceptible with the zone Justin Motz attacking the run up to 100 now for Virginia Tech trailing by 12 as Williams on the move for Syracuse Applause Mike young bringing over Rodney rice the bezilli just staying with it those extra effort plays lets get going to get the Hokies back in Justin Motts able to finish and capitalize brazilis a guy who has over 1400 points in his career transfer from Wright State first year of the Virginia Tech program Applause interesting that facility hasnt taken a threes a 3839 percent threepoint shooter sometimes you can find a way to get your five man out on the perimeter leading scorer with 18 bazilly rice the Miss Williams goes up top of the board the bottom Wings Im telling you Mr warmy like the bottom Wings between Benny Williams Malik Brown it changes the dynamic in how Syracuse can play because theyre able to cover so much ground Edwards drops it off unselfishly underneath the league Brown and thats enough for the DoubleDouble for brown first of his career Jesse Edwards though hes listed at 611 to be able to handle it like that showing off his versatility Edwards wins the fight Gerard wants to slow it down so the 10 rebounds for brown thats a career high hes just one short of his career high in points right now at 11 Applause significant contributions from The Freshman contingent for the orange Edward spins in the paint and lost it what a pass two on one for doula against Gerard and a foul called on Joe Gerard 46 to go and the fouls on Gerard as Padula was driving Orange in front 6853 foreign for the fast break presented by your local Ford dealer as we get a look at some of the top freshmen in the ACC this season Tom you line them up Ill knock him down Kyle filipowski has been terrific all season long standing about seven feet tall he has been a scoring Dynamo inside outside he does it both for the Blue Devils in Judah Metz we have him here today he is a scoring machine there might not be a more smooth guard in the conference in minutes Mike James for Louisville is somebody that continues to improve as the season goes along last weeks ACC freshman of the week continues to improve expanding his game beyond the threepoint line and Isaac McNeely opposing fan bases are gonna hes gonna drive them crazy for the rest of the four years that hes in college he plays with an edge he shoots it extremely well right at six points a game thats going to steadily increase through his career in Virginia and JJ Starling might be the most athletic of the bunch 64 200 pounds can score from everywhere an excellent athlete of course they all have to live up to the standard of Terence Oglesby back in the day wearing the Clemson uniform as the twotime ACC freshman of the week 0708 how about that not bad that guy had more hairs now all right were back with more after this word from your local Ford dealer thanks for watching the fast break in America the future belongs to everyone so we built the new Ford Bronco sport for everyone with seven available goat modes and a camera with offroad views its built for America Music break down the Best Bets across the sports landscape every weekday powered by bed and GM Sportsbook Mike Young and the Hokies need to draw something up quick make up this deficit they have been in some very tight games and over the last four Terence theyve lost them all but none by any more than five points and that includes that OT loss at BC and I dont think it gets any easier for Virginia Tech but a lot of those coincide with Hunter Couture not being in the lineup of Virginia Tech they kept it close this game hasnt been overly close but the next three as you said dont get into easement at Virginia at Clemson whos playing well and against a Duke team with a lot of talent especially in that freshman class when it rains it pours sometimes yeah and their opponent at the end of the month is this Syracuse team again so theyll meet up one more time 6 46 to go Padulas at the freethrow line Im not losing faith in this Virginia Tech team though I mean theres too many scoring options theres too much shooting sure they havent shot it well today on the day only two of 14 but there havent been all that many opportunities and whenever theyre not playing against this 23 Zone you know they can find more opportunities against manned defense medulla becomes the fourth Virginia Tech player to get the double digits with those free throws six and a half minutes or so to go in this second half and that was mutts stumbled on the drive and was fouled Applause he is constantly in attack mode he gets you on his hip you can forget about it hes strong enough at about six two six three Hes listed at 63 I think thats generous but hes got long arms crafty finisher strong body misses his first though had a chance to get the double digits with that free throw nine points for mints got three assists as well but sometimes with meds thats a deep one from rice and thats now one of their last 10 for Virginia Tech from the floor although brazily preserving The Possession Bryce out of the corner shot clocks at 10 for the Hokies Applause so for example right there Tom basilis wide open you have to take that shot the quick decision making in the second half hasnt been quite as good as it was in the first basily youre a good enough shooter right there at that freethrow line go ahead and knock that one through the Virginia Tech shot 52 percent in the first half just 29 the second half well the orange have kept it around 50 for the entire game offense rice just kind of lost track of where he was on the floor went out of bounds offense struggling a bit but Syracuses ability to recover on any Wing shooter has been downright impressive their activity level and energy has been really good today through the missiles out of the corner Edwards rebound for the orange number eight for Edwards youll notice the pressures coming from Virginia Tech who do they get the ball to Joe Gerard theres no rush and hes their settle down guy you get him the ball you know the rest of your offense is going to be fun Music Taylor shaking his way to the rim mutts the rebound Applause foreign Collins cant find the range Brazilian Edwards wrestled for the basketball and the arrow favors the orange with five 16 to go its so difficult youre out of rhythm and you still get a wide open shot up the corner MJ Collins went everywhere but in look excellent effort thats two big men know how much it means if youre trying to make a comeback in the Virginias Tech this doesnt help no field goals in the last three minutes for the Hokies now about five minutes to go Mead was as big as 22 in this half for the orange I thought Gerard was going to shoot better hes going to shoot that one balance patience deceptively Quick Change points Gerard mutts at the other end and tight Music Applause Padula try to poke it away and pick up the foul in the backboard it is really hard to press this Syracuse team mens excellent ball handler Joe Gerard always calm close bayheim coaching up Malik Brown we have to keep in mind too still a really young Syracuse Orange team I mean Mensa freshman Gerards the Elder Statesman but you have other guys on the floor Justin Taylor a freshman Malik Brown a freshman the youth movement in full effect schematics back in Collins out for Virginia Tech theres something to be said too about what Coach Boeheim does with his players he fills them up with confidence as red spots one down but he doesnt overcall his offense he lets his guys walk out a little bit and sometimes if they take a difficult shot hes okay with it and what does that do it allows you to explore a little bit is get another turnover by Virginia Tech so Gerard leads away with 19 Brown and Edwards with 11 mints just made that free throw hes got double digits as well Edwards on the drive in the dish Im gonna wave off the hoop oh wow I dont love this call Lee Cassell said the ball was tipped when it was going around the rim Malik Brown goes up and tries to flush it up and over everybody and I I think that basket should count he hangs on the rim a little bit but it doesnt affect the basketball Applause should have been a bucket and as a foul against bezilla at the other end for Virginia Tech Applause this is a team Tom the Syracuse team that doesnt typically rebound all that well and theyre winning the rebounding battle by one to or excuse me by two 3533 and really controlling the game brown with 10 rebounds Edwards also has 10 Edwards has a double double so Brown and Edwards double doubles tonight Malik Brown on the season only 43 points and 38 rebounds hes brought a different element to the bottom of that zone rebounding at a really high level Applause supposed to go inside of four minutes here in the orange distancing themselves from the Hokies this is probably not going to be a single digit close game to the end for Virginia Tech and unless they start making some threes by the way Edwards with his DoubleDouble that is now eight on the season for Edwards man hes been terrific Jesse Edwards on the glass protecting the rim and Joe Gerard hes handled a lot of spawns eight of 16 from the floor for Gerard take another one and hit it its just not effective not effective is there one solid defense the Poise of that young man so the matchup we were looking forward to Gerard and Padula has fallen in the favor of Joe Gerard in the orange again at halftime it was a sixpoint game 4337 Syracuse in front saved by Edwards thematics Applause I mean if theyve all been off dump downs and put backs but threepoint shooting 1015 from the field had himself quite a ball game two and a half minutes to go now in the orange in control of this one really it was those first few minutes of the second half where they took a lead extended that lead and never gave it up thanks to this guy being a big part of it and then he misses from long range the confidence I admire the confidence of some of these shots and whenever hes shooting at as well as what he has today seven made threes for the orange how about Virginia Tech from Beyond The Arc two of 18 and conventional wisdom would say youre going to get some opportunities from the three against Syracuse those bottom Wings just change things for this Syracuse team Applause so Joe Gerard and his 21 points on the night closing in on Victory against Virginia Tech accidents happen in the blink of an eye but if you think your accident happened fast wait until you see how quickly the insurance company moves to avoid paying you you cant afford to wait and you cant afford to get it wrong get the strong arm call Attorney John Foy and Associates no one moves faster or Works harder to get you

Continental welcome to the smart choice and tires Bars by 14 147 to go in regulation Syracuse has dominated this second half but appears to be on its way to Victory as its now time for The Fresh Market discover the best brown and Gerard for the orange well Gerards been terrific its been a lot of tough shot making Tom step backs floaters in the lane midrange jump shots over High hands hes been really good but Malik Brown has been a bit of a curveball for this Syracuse team hes got excellent athleticism really long arms the first time I saw him play he was playing with Team loaded Virginia and he was doing a lot of the same things that hes doing tonight being active on the boards finishing around the rim and protecting things around the basket as far as if hes not blocking shots hes at least contesting them at a high level and hes done a nice job of getting out on the perimeter too when youre on the bottom wing of that zone theres going to be some shots that you have to get out and contest he has that athletic ability to do that at a high rate Joe Gerard at the freethrow line for the fifth time this season 20 points or more for Gerard characteristic misses from the freethrow line academic at this point you would think 140 or so to go 7561 orange after leading by six at halftime Brazilian Brazilian basket and foul excellent pass by Motz hes operated fairly well there four turnovers on the day how quick was this decision made turn find and fire the silly Justin Taylor just a little bit too late coming over to help Applause with 23 third time this season basilys got 20 or more in a game and all likelihood in a losing effort tonight three yards could improve the 81 at the Dome against Virginia Tech Gerard hell step into a three ball forget about it rhythm the good hes coming off his hand nice and hes on balance theres not a whole lot you can do except for get out there and pray third three for Gerard 24 points Applause reads all scorers must got a basket at the other end and then committed a foul mints Joe Gerard I thought he had 31 for a career high against Richmond this season we have him for three made threes thats now 200 261 made threes for Gerard coach bayheim the teaching never stops well theres a lot of teaching but he has to be happy with that young man I mean Gerard and Malik Brown both who he was talking to you know its a Syracuse team thats thats young theyre still learning looks like theyre going to move their way into another win Joe Gerard though so difficult to guard in the half court 51 from the floor as a team in the game Gerard fifth all time and made threes here in Syracuse basketball history well drive and hell go to go to the line Applause might be a little too little too late for mutts but you have to love the aggressiveness turn around face up finish over the top so you get it Jesse Edwards comes up youre on an island there youre able to finish that shot thats where you can have success a little bit too late the road trip is going to continue for Virginia Tech two more Road games on this swing Syracuse will host Notre Dame coming up on Saturday and then trips to Miami and Georgia Tech watch out Edwards that should all but do it Jesse Edwards with the exclamation point 13 points for Edwards how about five players to the orange and double digits led by Gerard with 24 and the pressure on the rim never stops and why not get Joe Gerard an ISO foreign Applause thatll do it excellent game by Syracuse a lot of different guys contributing Five Guys and double figures and I think they found something with Malik Brown playing added minutes DoubleDouble for the young man he was terrific first of his career Edwards at his eighth DoubleDouble of the Season correction now Edwards 13 points nine rebounds thats a change
