Saturday is won five out of six officials tonight Jamie lucky TV Ted Valentine and Keith Kimber second meeting of the Season between Duke and Louisville Blue Devils on handedly at the Young Center back in late January heres the Freshman Jared McCain and able to draw the early foul on Mike James Kane over the last 19 games averaging a team best 16 points per hes just become more and more confident as the seasons going on and known for his prolific threepoint shooting but there turning the corner and getting to the rim drawing a Music foul forgot to ask him earlier what color was his nail polish going to be tonight on the fingernails McCain as this season has worn on continues to get better and looks like uh its a navy blue maybe look is it yeah look is a dark good color blue stups for Louisville Brandon Huntley Hatfield of the Tennessee transfer former five star has been their best player in conference sky Clark at 18 last Wednesday that was Louisvilles last game against Notre Dame and Here Comes Clark the drive the kick its Trey white for three and we have not seen many threes of late from Louisville just 10 in their previous three games they had its a good sign when the first one goes down and trying to be conscious of controlling the paint on both ends of the floor and that time Clark turns the corner to get in the paint R forces Duke in rotation kicks it off going an open three you saw the starters for Duke Jeremy roach today making career start number 100 Clark to strong Pro to the Applause rebound roach and filipowski pick and roll game doesnt work and Caleb Clen takes it away both teams are starting to drop cover trying to keep their big match ups on their big they dont want to rotate unless they have to let these guys just cop St 101 hfield going right out lowski no good roach is there and Glenn gets caught tied up with the ACC preseason Player of the Year second team foul on the bill filipowski did a great job there defending honey hfield on the other end and they spr down the floor forcing them to rotate and thats what white teams are playing to drop cover they want to keep those two guys on each other it rotation trying to match up theyll switch with the other four guys but theyre going to try to keep flip and honey half field guarding guarding each other pler off balance and when you see that as a guard you want to get aggressive you dont need to settle when you come off that ball screen or that dribble hand off when youre in drop coverage turn the corner put pressure on the defense and proor did a good job there Proctor had a career high 24 against Louisville last month Clark Drew attention turned it over little over dribbling there Center the floor Duke is just sitting there in the driving the lane looking to help out and one of those unforced eror turnovers there and Mark Mitchell called for steps so he just turned the corner and drop coverage and because Philip hsky is in the game H headfield doesnt come over and easy Music late lot of dribbling by Clark his pass knocked down Philip palski ahead to Mitchell you dont want to turn it over in this building no one and I mean no one is better after creating turnovers turning in transition points than Duke and came so you got to keep the crowd out of it if you your Cardinals and take care of the basketball couple careless turnovers here now you see them slowing things down trying to get it inside skip pass to James now its white and that three in and out now you mentioned those turnovers live ball turnovers have been an issue all season long for Louisville and there just both times here has come with over dribbling both teams have had a couple of cess turnovers just trying to do a little too much just get the deflection there and the Philip palsky his skill set hes the most skilled s Foo in the country Mark Mitchell fills the lane and not many teams Center can push the break in a foul power for can feel a lane and just one of the advantages that the Blue Devils Applause have Clark in his last game was seven for eight from the field he had missed the previous two with a rib injury now one of the issues that skot Clark has is theres a lot of pressure on him to put pressure on the defense with his because theres not a lot of ball handles on the L team the shot clock winded down Clark had to put it up you know Blue Devils have multiple handles they essentially have three point guards on the court proor catch and Applause shoot lville has missed four of its first five Duke doing a really good job there roach get through the defense getting through the screen Philipi the filipowski the block on Huntley Hatfield and Louisville almost turned it over five to shoot Music James over Mitchell and its knocked away last touch Kyle filipowski and itll be Louisville ball 63 three duke on top a win in the Blue Devils clinch and double bu in the ACC tournament greatness is a feeling a moment a choice unrelenting a team effort

storming like when are we going to ban that like how many times does a player have to get into something where they get punched or they get pushed or they get taunted right in their face and it its a dangerous thing the court storm heard around the world you heard John Shys comments Kyle filipowski tweeted afterwards this got to change theres been a lot of talk a lot of hot takes in the past 48 72 hours but Randolph a couple of things jump to mind one right for the folks out there who are trying to vilify Kyle filipowski and portray him as the villain when youve got essentially a mob running at you Im not sure what else you wanted him to do we talked about this before Wake Forest did have protocols in place it just didnt work yes I mean there was a protocol in place Ive seen it that wasnt executed properly I think we all know that uh the most important thing is philipos is okay I just think now that we have time to you see him out here playing we got time to reset and thatll be tabled I think the leadership of colle Collegiate Sports will step up well get to the bottom of it and find a better solution for everybody I think everybody will be happy roach gets the laye a lot of talk if this is the Tipping Point that will Outlaw Court storms in college basketball on paper that may sound like a good idea putting that into practice you can find a school you can find a conference all you want I dont know if students who may have um em bied a little earlier that day care if their schools getting fined 100000 or a million dollars theyre going to storm the court if they want to yeah I dont think that some of the takes that was said about that I think its a little aggressive and I think now everybody can calm down a little bit and and then the cooler hairs Prevail we get come up with a proper solution there comes James the other way Hunley Hatfield great position inside and he drops it in had to take advantage of that transition basket there Louisville had numbers and Duke unable to get matched up filipowski is the only Duke starter not to have scored Mitchell on the drop off will shoot Music two its contact there you see filipowski iss late finally find Huntley half field there Point Blank Range hes going to be unstoppable he gets it that Applause deep thats two early fouls on Mike James averages 13 a game although last time out just one for seven two points he means a lot to this lineup with his ability to draw fouls and the pressure he puts on the defense Saturday here on accn and the ESPN app a Lacrosse double header first first its the UNC woman hosting the Notre Dame woman at 1100 am and then Johns Hopkins in Virginia two story programs face off at clner at one Eastern right now the number one team on the mens side the Duke Blue Devils those was after practice earlier today Randolph they have the best team in the country and they have in brenn and ONeal maybe not just the best player in college lacrosse but maybe the best lacrosse player out there period saw you out there today talking to the coach watching practice see you were in your element for sure I had to remind you we hadit a basketball game today Im going to make you a lacrosse F before were done tonight Jared McCain gets the crazies riled up no one is better at shooting the basketball with their feet set than Jared McCain so on balance form looks good was almost one to counter before Lees his hand Caleb Glenn for three that doesnt go thats not a shot only one of eight from three on the season now Road picked up by Huntley Hatfield they got a mismatch on the inside they try to throw it in Glen The Intercept Speedy freshman Tyler Johnson up ahead to Clark and thats what Tyler Johnson brings to this offense I think hes a Difference Maker for him and his speed is something you envision its something you just cant practice he and Burton the two guys in his League that I think are the fastest players in the league with the ball in their hand and when you when your scout team guys cant prepare you for that speed when you get out of the Court this is a great job by Glen coming over there but he just pushes it Vision great bounce pass across cour these two guys together I think offensively helped Louisville because now they got multiple handlers and multiple decision makers and could be an advantage to see usually they play with you know subing each other and now theyre playing together and I think it can be a good lineup against this Duke team that can attack so many different guys wowski still looking for his first points and checking in for Duke Shawn Stewart The Freshman this guy has crazy athleticism School record 36 in standing vertical Zion Williamson by the way was 35 Ines yeah hes an elite athlete and hadnt quite quck rotation consistently all year but sh told us tonight that he in power will get out there early and get those guys involved and he needs to get these guys going because as March comes into play theyre going to be needed again no Caleb Foster tonight he is weak to week with a lower leg injury Ryan young in there as well for Duke reverse layup by Trey white the USC trans thats for knocked down three earlier that time turns and rips trying to post up and use his size inside against the smaller back for any of the guards against Duke he has a distinctive height advantage against the move he can just get it inside he can just turn and Elevate over top of them proor to Stewart the elevation young fellas showing coach hey I need to be in this rotation nice drop off of there and great job keeping yourself going thats how you get going instead of setting outside popping and taking a jump shot he cuts rewarded for his Music movement and you dont want to get into a jump of contest near the rim with him at all roach picks up the foul just the first team foul on Duke easy penetration here by Pro doing what he does and Shan Stewart is Up Up and Away Duke Blue Devils up six here early first half come back

Tennessee number 14 Alabama Saturday on ESPN here we go introducing the allnew TD clear credit card with no late fees and no interest just a simple monthly fee thats how credit can be unexpected ly human call 1844 TD clear for details about credit cost and terms time to do lots of nothing lazy boy long live the Music lazy Music Duke has committed five turnovers already and John shy preached to us a shoot around today this is one of those dont assume games on paper Dukes a heavy favorite they took care of Louisville with ease most teams have done that this season in the ACC but youre coming off that high of playing at a soldout Joel over the week again against wake fors we saw what happen to wake fors last night against Notre Dame now you face a quote unquote lesser opponent and sometimes you can get caught well he used that as ammunition for his King saying hey you know what were coming off a loss here and I think he reminded his guys what happened to wake he said you know what were everyone Super Bowl we faced that against wake and we lost and then expect that again here tonight we need to come out with a sense of urgency and little sluggish on the offensive end was slopping this with some turnovers thatll stay with Louisville meanwhile the Cardinals on the season just three and 13 in the ACC and away from The Young Center only one win all season been a tough go here year two for Kenny Applause pay Tyler Johnson cant get it in looked like he was trying to call time out ends up getting it in four to shoot Clark pulls up and the rebound to Roach I think Clark turn the corner there he rejected the screen I dont think there was much in front of him and hes sing for that midrange pull up I think he can get all the way to paint Force rotation just Applause finished McCain for three too much a COR four couldnt bring it in young the offensive rebound at a fresh 20 Ryan young always seemed to have an impact on the game that do so many different things that had show up on a stat she defensively he brings a physicality to this team he plays really hard hes unselfish on the offensive end and while he was warded to be one of the captains of his Duke team his unselfish play second season with the Blue Devils after coming over from Applause Northwestern and Jamie lucky talks it over with Keith Kimble and Ted Valentine yeah initially called the foul and then now you see the elbow to the face which is usually an automatic playr Music one its unintentional Mains just trying to sail the foul there hes driving and letting the officials know hes trying to sell the foul I think this should be quick theyll look at this at the monitor Duke has only committed one team foul in this first half this would be Louisville sixth and it fits on Clark its his second I like that we get the call right on these I just wish we could figure out way late game speed this up and I always say can we have someone at the scores table that time that that you know thats like the fourth official or someone thats in charge of that that can just say look at it and give their the officials the the right call youre the replay judge and they come to you instead of looking hes got an answer yeah it just was speed it up I I think its unfair at times late in ball games you just get a timeout you just automatically Say Hey I want want you take a look at it so theyre going to call a technical on McCain and a common foul on sky Clark thats what we expected the blowable to shoot thats the right ball was accidental with the right Applause call and the free throw spins out six turnovers for Duke now and that was the fifth team foul on Louisville and white missed them both youre on the road youre at Cameron Ure youre 3 and 13 in conference play you know you got to make those yeah prior to that hes played well offensively Applause hes hit a couple threes hes the lead score on the floor right now with five points with this lineup out there hes the only person with this lineup that has scored so I see the reason for putting them there CSE Williams a freshman sharpshooter in there for Louisville hes a sniper from the outside here comes white the double by roach the tie up and we get a jump ball possession arrow to Duke I hope J roach is okay there and shy mentioned this earlier in the shoot around that when they run that that middle ISO there they turn it back come from the weak side Jeremy roadin his leg rolled up on underneath but he did a great job coming from the weak side creating that turnover roach will stay in and we get a first look of the night at the Freshman TJ power hes in there to hunt shots from the outside hasnt played a whole lot this year 18 games only 6 minutes a game but 23 of his 27 shots or threes yeah hes out there to do one thing and not shoot threes and hes home he a great environment for him hes comfortable here you need to start getting these younger guys ready Sean SC these guys at the end of this bench see if they can help become ACC tournament and into the ntaa tournament especially given the uncertainty with Caleb Foster that we asked John sh about it he said hes definitely out this week and Ill probably out through the end of next week said it would be a week toe issue Johnsons three not there the car to Mitchell yeah when its week to week you know its pretty serious lets see if hes back by the ACCC tournament and you definitely want him help before the NCA that started lineup with him and it was 10 and one in the Year Mitchell F side thats really not a match up on the floor for Mark Mitch when he the rotation they really small when they switch and as a 69ine his size and athleticism for L there really not a match up for him that time they switch to the five and if hes dominating the five this way this just not much you can do cor for is just he has the hike you can see Coach P goes to his bench and brings Huntley hfield back in the game its going to play with a bigger lineup with those Applause guys Dukes got MIT Kapowski out there Johnson on the drive and theres that burst again speed Bur I think he is as quick as they come I said he and Burton with the ball in his hands for the fight N I think theyre as fast as they come Mitchell thought about the line drive three puts it on the floor loose ball its white they got numbers if they push Applause it Johnson inside Huntley Hatfield to cor for and fouled by power thats going to be his second but it all starts with Johnson his speed and his ability to get by his Defender he gets in the paint forces rotation and I think Huntley has failed ability to catch on the Move hes such a big time Talent on the move he gets you here drives he can pass he can score and great drop off to his teammate Applause Music Applause there coming up after this game on acc Network its the premere of Coach K and Roy Williams Rivals reunited its an hourong special featuring the coaching Legend sitting down with West her together for an extensive conversation for the first time since their college coaching careers began more than 40 years ago theyve been together on sets in at media day but never like this they did it at the Greensboro Coliseum great setting they had a live studio audience and just candid Answers by two of The Legends in this conference and two of The Legends in college basketballs white pushes in transition coach Kay and Coach William still competing against each other even in the chair it should be great I look forward to seeing it and Coach K there was one great snipet hes talking about you know his rivalry when Coach K started out at Duke with Dean Smith and he said you know I knew how great Dean was back then but I wasnt going to be the one to bow down and kiss the ring and then once Duke and Mike shashy started to win the appreciation for Dean Smith started to grow knowing wow what he did is pretty darn impressive just down the road just legendary coaches and unbelievable play uh people and I really look forward to seeing everything about that McCain catch release not there Williams stays in bounds Mitchell comes up with it roach hes been lights out from three this season 47 his best year in the Duke Blue Devils uniform and this is the biggest difference in the first game between these two was the numbers and the percentages were the same it was the 15 offensive rebounds by the Blue Devils that was the biggest difference in the game taking advantage of the glass there Johnson the shake on filipowski tried to use the window had a beat I thought he again there s a midrange jump shot off the bounce roach pulls and hits 100th career start for roach who scored at least 16 and three straight time out Kenny Applause Music Payne that is must TV give her the ball are

thats our move womens college hoops on ESPN and ABC the Blue Devils coming out in Jeremy roach here stepping into a three here he banged his knee early was it seemed like it bothered him for a second but nothing makes you feel better than backto back threes and your personal 60 run push the Blue Devil lead up to six here and we see Jeremy Ro 100 starts from his career look at that list of players right there yeah that is since 0607 which was John Shys first season in a Duke uniform Its Your Food Lions food for thought and when we talk to John sh about roachs shooting he said listen for four years both he and Mike shashy have been preaching with roach you are a terrific Catch and Release guy as McCain lets it Fly and hits youve got to get to him on the catch I think youre almost have to say hey run him off the line at this point I mean he his ability to get his feet set and Rhythm and catch and shoot hes as good as there is in the ACC if not the country no good by Huntley Hatfield this is a danger zone for Louisville Dukes on a 90 run and for Louisville weve seen these mini runs turn into Game ending gamechanging runs but Johnson The Freshman with the answer to quiet the crowd something to keep an eye on The Possession before that Huntley Hatfield filipowski on him and he didnt leave him oneonone he came and he double forced to turn over and got the three in transition and Philip palowski banged his knee in that Court St without a field goal so far to the left hand and thats his first made basket three points for the sophomore I think the knee is okay he turns he pivots and you pivot off that knee and with the nice left kiss off the glass nothing give nothing heals you like the ball gives you energy when youre score Curtis Williams Miss fires hes been struggling from threepoint range and that is his calling card and we get a foul away from the ball on Duke its on filipowski he look at that hes just constantly banging hes waiting to see if any help great footwork nice kiss off glass left there by slip here he doesnt have to use that arm you see the hook there left arm grabbing Glen by the waist hes you flip just let him decide how he wants to play if he wants the front youll get a flash the top for the big and throw it over the top he stays behind you just kept you to go to work like he did the previous possession and a demonstrative call the other R by Ted Valentine as we get a kick B I guess he wouldnt have it any other Applause way now you notice now Duke is switching ball screens now theyre switching one through five and with this lineup you want to run a ball screen with Hy half field and try to attack him inside with the guard put a poke that guard up here comes Glenn he set a career high in scoring in two of his last four games with a nice dip under filipowski and what that does is as a guard if Im switching on a big and hes posting me up I dont want to help off the drive this what you just saw there I want to stay that big and try to keep him from getting leverage and getting position try the behind the back pass and we got a whistle flip is going to tell Sean Stewart hey young fell when you on the Flo with me I do it all keep your eyes open here look at this behind the back pass no look there Stewart wasnt ready for Applause that and itll be a one and one Huntley Hatfield pick up picks up the foul Sean Stewart top 20 player coming out of high school number one player out of Florida and his reputation when he got to Duke was as a Defender someone who can guard all five positions and he had the rep as an elite shot blocker I think having flip come back and move over to the center spot to play your Center most of the year has hurt him some they dont they dont theyre not playing as big as they did last year last year the front line was with Lively and filipowski played the four and Mitch played the three and if they under that team he probably would have got more minutes as a pressure power puts it on the floor left it short tipped up and out of bounds Ks another one of those highly recruited highly talented freshman and his strength is catching and shooting threes and that time showing you he can put it on the floor as well heres the love to Stewart who can go get it youre not going to throw that over his head no help from the guard there you saw the back screen got to help and thats going to be a blocking foul on Stewart The Freshman tried to sell it yeah back screen there Johnsons trying to tell Glenn to get through it and not in position to offer much help Shan just goes up and gets that if youre Louisville Randolph you got to figure out a way to get Mike James going last time out against Notre Dame he was a nonfactor two points one for seven from the field hes scoreless tonight this is your number two scorer and for most of the Season he was their number one scorer he is and hes got in foul trouble earlier in a game like this you just got to tell them go play dont worry about fouls just stay aggressive tendency is to get Applause passive Johnson ran out of an angle now McCain Mitchell underneath to thats the problem the biggest issue with this Louisville team is the inability to keep the ball out of the paint either off the pass or dribble penetration thats how the king just get to the front of the rim you have to rotate and when you drop it off the ball gets that deep its just impossible to get any rotation or any else and Stewart picks up his second foul Sean Stewart here is going up up up and away catching a l heel putting the dke Blue Devils up 16 greatness is a feeling a moment a choice Applause unrelenting a team effort greatness is accomplishing on this field and this one greatness is more than winning the game its changing it greatness is what we do

ESPN I feel like were living in a movie love you guys Formula 1 is go oh its contact Formula 1 and his absolute finest oh this is Formula 1 the XFL and the usfl merged to create one powerful Spring football league called the uflow Spring football Inc is here to stay the UFL season kicks off March 30th on Fox ESP and Randolph childrens with you at Cameron indor in the modern game you you got to shoot the three and youve got to defend the three and of late Louisvilles doesnt either well its impossible to theyre not a threepoint shooting team and thats one issue they have on the offensive end of the floor but their biggest issue is you look at it thinking theyre not getting there part of the reason theyre not getting the shooters is they cant contain a dribble the ball is getting to the basket theyre constantly in rotation and theyre late the close outs and and theyre paying for it and you cant win a lot of games with this type of discrepancy from threepoint line and today Louisville facing a Duke team that is shooting 39 from three in conference tops in the league the Blue Devils number one in ACC play in offensive efficiency and Louisville in conference games last in defensive efficiency so was safe to say thats not a pretty good match up for you I just there are better match ups L here goes to the zone and create a turnover out of it theres Trey white Clark has the mismatch on Mitchell gives it up and see one thing here in your offense you dont have threepoint shooting but Duke doesnt have a shot blocker attack the rim Force rotation forc the whistle to blow James almost turned it over and Applause does I think he saw the the RO the Trap coming and tried to skip it but just unable to execute the Applause play rocker want space Johnson steals it away he is B time Applause fast heartley Hatfield regains and gets the two thats what Im saying get the ball in the paint to the rim good things happen for you you force rotation now Huntley half field doesnt have any anybody to box him out whos able to gather Miss and TI go to the offensive glass now theyre in their Zone Proctor three no good youre going to give up shots in the zone just got to make sure you secure the rebound in good possession there Clark down the lane yeah you got will get a foul on the floor to your point hey theres not a shot blocker that demands your respect go to the basket absolutely this is the aggression you see now honey Hatfield was like hey youre on fi the pass to switch you get out Hunley Hatfield comes in and good things happen you dont have to be a great shooting team know what you are but one thing you can do you got to be able to drive the ball to the rim put pressure on you force rotation and second possession in a row now your big is involved because hes cleaning up the glass and getting loose balls off the penetration of the guards Five Points seven rebounders including four offensive rebounds for Branded Huntley Hatfield hes been their top scorer in ACC play and really in a league full of quality big men because Louisvilles record yes is not amongst the better teams he gets lost he is one of the better big men in this league I dont think theres a team in the league he couldnt starve for either at the four the five I mean hes hes that talented that good Mitchell driving on Huntley Outfield and the whistle blows it is a foul on Hunley Hatfield is second theyre going to try to stay in the zone to help him hes average look at that 18 and8 nearly 60 from the floor in the last six games and you see him telling Coach pay you know my bad you cant you cant commit another foul here in the last two minutes of the half nobody at the scores table so its not as if okor 4 is going to spell them he scored your last few points you got to have him out there have you had a mark light Shake I have you have not next time youre in Coral Gables stopped by the old ballpark Mark light Shake Miami of Florida second of three ACC Baseball green Easter in the S all sorts of flavors the milkshake at the Miami baseball games we walked by when we were there a few weeks wait a minute I was there with you so you got to say think it didnt take me as what youre telling me well they werent playing we walked by when the office was closed Applause okay one of the perks of doing a game there is run around the seventh inning stretch a little bit before that they come ask you for your flavor and then they bring it up to you so whats your flavor what you tell me should I go theres this peanut butter Reeses concoction does the trick every time any peanut butter thing you got me right there pull up by McCain another offensive rebound its Mitchell in the first meeting Duke had 15 offensive rebounds filipowski to Mitchell and Johnson really had one option which was to foul thats one thing the Freshman have to learn cant get caught behind when you know you switch hes got to get around in front there that tra behind Mitchell there and theres nothing he can do a one and one for Mitchell who had a double double last month against Louisville actually played really well he had 20 and 12 last game and misses the front end of the one and one there and in possession there for the Blue Devils Mitchells got eight tonight Duke is 30 and three when he scores 10 plus as sky Clark able to draw the foul you know if youre Louisville you watch this first half and youre probably saying Duke hasnt played all that well no they havent but you helped them with that with early turnovers and now these last couple of minutes you see theyre doing a better job of attacking the rim challenging Duke at The Rim forcing rotation and theyre theyre starting to pile up fouls on Duke and and climb back into this game a little bit make it a game Louisville just 8 for 30 from the field one for 11 from three and now four of eight from the free throw line Duke on the other hand has shot it well but has turned it over 10 times which is already more than their season average credit the little but theyre flying around I think the recipe for them is not to settle theyve taking 11 threes here in the first half theyre only one of 11 and you cant shoot yourself in the foot missing free throws but continue to attack the gim and put pressure on his Defense John shy calls a timeout well be back in 30 seconds Duke up 13 true story theres nothing more marched than a conference title Chase these two teams have been fantastic so far this is an old school SEC rivalry its the volunteers oh my goodness what a start for Tennessee and the Crimson tie theres not a faster offense in all of college ball the numbers back it up the SEC Crown is coming down to the wide experience number four Tennessee number 14 Alabama Saturday at 8 on ESPN 13point lead for Duke and the Blue Devils have gone more than 3 minutes since their last field goal but Louisvilles missed six of its last seven Cardinals have left some points at the free throw line they havent shot it well Duke has been sloppy with the basketball it hasnt been the most aesthetic opening 20 minutes but Duke still up very comfortably theyre shooting the basketball well the only thing that stopped the blue up was is theyve stopped themselves for turning the basketball over and credit the Louisville theyve been active theyve been rotating and getting their hands on deflection and changing your defenses is what you have to do when youre playing against a team as such as talented as the Blue Devils are you just cant give them the steady di of the same thing and now theyre in foul trouble lets see if they change their defense and they look like theyre going to go 131 here giv it blue that was something to think about Proctor gets it to filipowski in the high post right by Glenn and it falls in thats the guy you want to get it to Big Target in the middle of that zone hes able to put it on the deck theres not a more skilled sevenfooter in the country than KY filipowski dont settled if you L get to the rim midrange Trey white knocks it down hes the one guy that has knocked down a couple of jump shots Applause tonight they got foul trouble here but they going lets see if theyre going to go Kenny pain Danny Manning is yelling instructions trying to get the match up together they want to put Huntley Hatfield in the dun spot against Mark Mitchell roach over Glenn front rim Mitchell and time runs up 23 one half in the B and just getting those guys ready so when theyre called you just need to be a hero for that day and play well that day and this could be one of these games as Mitchell gets free inside if this lead starts to expand in mushroom you might see John shy give some of those bench guys TJ power Sean Stewart who we mentioned an extended run in the second half get them some vital minutes here in conference play definitely need to do that and one guy Im surprised one of his veteran guards Jay Blakes hadnt played much and known as a Defender bring some toughness on the defensive end and they had needed it tonight so far Trey white makes that shot from the Baseline but that has been almost the microcosm of Louisville theyve taken a lot of tough shots over these last few games you can even expand that further and say its been a symptom most of the season well its difficult to continue to stay aggressive on the offensive end when you unable to keep the ball out of the paint and at The Rim it allows you to get kick kick fre just like that its because of the penetration and then youre not always accustomed to dealing with it from a center and thats one of the issues in defending this Duke Blue Devil team but their inability to guard the ball is the biggest issue that they have 11 now for McCain Glenn doubled along the Baseline and really that Baseline served as a third Defender and now it gives it up roach pushing McCain to Mitchell whos got a dozen and remember Duke is 30 and three when he scores in double figures an early timeout by Kenny Payne as duke is open to the second half on a 72 Music run greatness is a feeling a moment a choice unrelenting a team effort greatness is accomplishing on this field and this one greatness is more than winning the game its changing it greatness is what we do accomplish Music greatness the competitions never been better this is just spectacular the stars have never been brighter thats our move womens college hoops on ESPN and Music ABC I feel like were living in a movie love you guys formula one is go oh its contact Formula One at its absolute finest this is Formula 1 the most passion the most intensity this was the way basketballs supposed to Applause be Im taking the T Im Wrecking the land I keep it hardcore cuz its dope man what better way to get the juices flowing and to get your adrenal go thats inro I keep it hardore like you never saw you w to Music Applause Music beere then its round one of Duke Carolina the best rivalry in college basketball and number five Tennessee takes on number 10 Kentucky boy if that doesnt get you going I dont know what will experience the Blockbuster triple header today on Music ESPN The Freshman Jared McCain 11 points three of five from Deep tonight you have to get to him if you notice hes catching all the shots catching shoot threes here hes dropping off the dime to Mark Mitchell but you got to run him off the line there and this position they catch Louisville just not getting back on defense and he is having himself a freshman year and I think him and Burton and Bub Carrington the award is between 03 and its going to be hard taking that award out of Durham I can tell you that hes making it difficult if you had a vote who do you give ACC freshman of the year to oh you going to do that to me yes I am um I you know what I think its its McCain and I I I think all three of them I I think this goes down to the very I think its one of the answer if youre asking me to vote today um Im going to say Burton that not a and and I say because I think he has the most responsibility throw away the its the one award in the league that I dont associate with winning okay I I think it it doesnt matter if you coming I think hes had the the most productive year uh for a freshman and no player in the league has more responsibil on the team he has yeah thats fair now for the record five of the last six and eight of the last 10 ACCC rookie of the years have gone to Duke Blue Devils the only non Duke players to win the award in that span Dennis Smith from NC State and Scotty Barnes from Florida State I think this is the year it can happen a couple of those freshman from duke were they were freshman SL Player of the Year candidates they were so good so banero Zion baggley those are special players Tyler Johnson to beat the shot clock and the banks not Applause open and again I I think hes sh McCains had a great year and wouldnt be disappointed if he got the award I just think Marcus Burton has just has so much on his plate and as he goes to fighting our go here comes James and He will draw the foul Two Shots coming well Louisville down 18 their two leading scores Scott Clark and Mike James have been nonf factors tonight James with a chance to get his first points at the night of the night yeah James picked up two quick fouls on this one and the tendency when you get fouls early you just get tentative and you dont get aggressive and theyre just jumping into proor trying to force the whistling and thats what he does he draws a ton of fouls third leading free throw attempt shooter in the League this year and just hadnt quite gotten it going tonight only two field goals youre not in the game when you only take two shots and when youre 13 a game in the second lead SC the team you need that guy to take more shots and be more assertive particular in a game like this if youre going to come away with an upset and last Wednesday when Louisville last played against Notre Dame a 22point home loss James only had two points in that game on one of seven shooting this was a guy who with three straight games with 20 points just a month ago roach snakes inside went Zone there and the Blues ability to knock down threes you get so spread out the number one thing again with Louisville is not containing the dribble and you cant have someone drive against the zone and Lay It Up Clark off the feed from Johnson and Louisville Now 1 for 13 from three Huntley half field working on filipowski and hell get two shots you see the Zone here and just just cant have this against the zones two three Zone and Roes drives down the lane and just no resistance very little resistance in what a year hes had tomorrow night 10 Eastern after the womens basketball double header the nothing but net crew will break it down all the highlights analysis of every game plus a look ahead to the best matchups coming your way this weekend its right here on accn filipowski doesnt have the numbers tonight but wonder if hes still a little sore from the cord storming incident and youd like to get get this one over with and if you can rest him and let him continue to recover you would like it now Mitchell wanted to throw down Mitchell looked like me try to duck right there I didnt think that was close sky Clark the reverse layup well he had made up his mind I think the minute he he got inside the threepoint Arc you could see the wheels spinning and he had made up his mind it looked like he decided he wasnt going to do it it looked like me like I think I can do it and then you get there like no I cant Road for three almost young the offensive rebound hes in there for filipowski back out to Roach this time it hits three for four from downtown 13 for the senior 47 from behind High the threepoint line I dont think you want to give him back to back looks and just St in the Rhythm right Applause now this isnt a Duke crushy team that theyve had years past this team is moreing the gaps keeping the ball in front give up a midrange jump shot there theyll live with those type of shots but we talked so much about their offense the number one in field goal descent the second in scoring and three pointers an assist but this team is fourth in the league and scoring defense big to Big the reverse Jam by Mark Mitchell they do a great job of four and the five playing off each other whether its Mitchell Flip or Ryan young just playing amongst each other when they catch the ball theyre looking for that dunk spot Mitchells got a game high 14 Tyler Johnson no good hes three of 11 from the field and thats what I mean the Freshman to learn hes sett for that 17footer its Ryan young in there at The Rim attack him you know you do all your working out in the summertime time show Roger has his three R Music out Clark Shens through the D for two there you go dont continue to settle for those midrange shots Louisville one for 13 from three you can see why the previous three games they were 10 for 44

and you play with three point guards on the floor you expect the ball to move and Sh said they they they actually fell into this more when proor initially went out of the lineup he Pro Tyrese proor dominated the ball when he went out he felt like they played with a fast and pace and when he came back he just said hey lets continue to play this way and no one is unselfish as he is and the ball just continues to move and you can see there 15 assists on 20 basket its just difficult to guard a team with this skill set James over filipowski who hits the deck got to wonder given what happened this weekend and even though filipowski is feeling better if youre John shy how much longer does Kyle filipowski stay in the game well this ones far from over this is still Within Reach and he he

wanted to send their best wishes to Nolan Smith one of the greats who played here in Durham was on that 2010 National Championship team he was an AllAmerican ACC Player of the Year in 2011 and then held a number of different roles as an assistant coach and as a staffer for Mike Shashi yes unbelievable guy and obviously a very talented player and should always be able to come home and a lot of people came out to see him today shoot around and I know he had to be happy about Applause that here comes Proctor uncontested yeah got for chasing again and no one in the help spot for Louisville and continue to give up points at The Rim Duke is shooting 56 from the field only thing that stop Duke is themselves with the turnovers the basket is good plus the foul for Huntley Applause Hatfield great job by Tyler Johnson there showing his speed attacking the switch beat pow off the dribble there and then dropping it off and nothing flip could do there cant have the cor drives like that and you especially cant have it in the middle shooting team 77 but tonight 7 of 14 Cardinals just 39 from the floor and 1 for 13 from three heres power and theres a triple for the Freshman TJ power just what you wanted to see great job by Jeremy roach there they came down proor called a manto man play Roach identifi they were in zone called his own offensive play got the ball to flip in the high post and kicked it over the power for and open three and theyre going to get power with his third foul great job getting the flip thats what he does and most of his shots come from behind the threepoint line and Coach sh said want to get these guys going he brings it when hes on the floor you got to get to him you got to know where he is and I think he can open up the floor for some of these other guys four assists for filipowski to go on with seven rebounds and seven points white the runner too much here comes roach easy two for Jeremy roach hes got 17 to lead all scores great job getting the stop there and pushing it sounded like a broken record saying another architect layup for the Blue Devils and but we got two freshman here that shy is trying to get these guys comfortable and minutes and stward and and power and they played well during this Applause stretch lead have expanded with these guys in now up 19 and I think he tried to lead them out as much as possible if they can continue to on his lead or sustain Duke right now sitting pretty in Joe lardys projections currently Joe has them in that top four seed grouping but theres a few teams in the ACC you cant lose to where it could really hurt you its put the pass cleans up cant lose to Louisville cant lose to Georgia Tech and you know you want to say you cant lose to Notre Dame Notre Dame starting to play well a lot was made of wake dropping the ball last night no nams quietly won four out of five you had them over the weekend they almost came back from 29 on the road against Syracuse that was the one game in that stretch they lost throw the numbers out I think theyre the best defensive team in the ACC really their issue is scoring theyre most theyre the most physical team in the league and I think theyre the best defensive team in the league they just cant score the ball they have offensive challenges but the reason theyre in game is because youre going to know youre in a fight when you play against Notre Dame and now theyre starting the young guys are gaining confidence and coach fors was nervous about that game he was worried you know they had coming off a big game the crowd was crazy for them against Duke and they they won that game but he was worried about the arage knowing that theyre starting to figure some things Music out ACC Bracketology that lost to Notre Dame still leagues wait for us in the field a projected 10 seed Virginia now in precarious bubble territory their offense has been hit or miss and more Miss than hit of late it is they had scored 50 in the last three games and they have got to figure some things out they got a game tonight against Boston College and I think its a must game if the Cavaliers Dro this game tonight I think theyll find themselves on the outside looking in and and bubbling and you know just a couple of games ago that team was playing as well as any team in this league and BC is one of those teams you group them with Virginia Tech with Syracuse with Florida State yes if Miamis healthy if they can get healthy which is a big if right now but theres a handful of teams that nobodys really talking about for the NCAA tournament right now that can really put a dent in somebodys resume well thats where we are at this point in the year you only have a couple of games left Applause and you look at wake right wakes a great example he lose the noted Aim so the margin of error that you may have gained as we get a foul from the win against Duke you give up some of that you still have Virginia Tech on the road you still have Clemson if you win those two I dont think theres any issue I think Wake Forest was in and ran up weve seen that enough defensively they can play with anybody if they can just figure out playing a little better on the road and playing a little better defensively theres no reason to think that not only can they get in but they can play to second weekend theyve shown you they can and defensively I think theyre fine theyre right there in gamees they just cant close games on the road but I think theyre a tournament team were just going off of what what being projected saying like now Virginia we just saw about a nardy last foran you know one of the later teams in so Road ja back roach is just I mean his efficiency has just been unbelievable this year and shoting 48 from the field and 47 for3 and 86 from free throw line just has been as consistent I think the blue Devils most consistent player all year long the senior captain now with 16 or more in four straight games hes got 19 tonight Johnson goes to work on the k freshman against freshman eight points for Tyler Johnson I think he can get to the rim whenever he wants I think he shouldnt settle as Applause much even when teams back off of just take up the space drive it with his speed to get more comfortable hell see when picks up foul number three jery Ro has going here turns the corner doing what hes been doing all day living in the

about basketball coaching and their Applause careers our games had the best ingredients you have the official dont screw it up its going to be a Laughter help so I watch a lot of the clips that youll see tonight when you get to watch the full conversation with Coach Kan Roy Williams and westm does a tremendous job of advancing that conversation playing moderator and asking the right questions but Mike shushi gets into how he worked the refs and you have been as a coach and a player on the other side of that be honest how many calls per game was he probably worth um it didnt bother me as much as a player let me say that uh earful and make sure that they knew his team he didnt feel his team was getting a fair shake and and you mentioned West and I know he did a great job as he always does but Im upset with West right now hes sending me pictures when we talked about the milkshake he sending me a picture of him and Cory Alexander with that peanut butter banana milkshake and I got to get better friends man Im just telling you Golf Course is closed for w texting R off during a game main has 14 for Duke yeah thats St get this open and bu his lead open here McCain cannot allow him to get catch and shoot threes and no ones better at doing now back in 30 seconds Randolph will try to find better friends greatness is a feeling a moment a choice unrelenting a team effort greatness is accomplishing on this field and this one greatness is more than winning the game its changing it greatness is what we do accomplish greatness largest lead of the game for Duke Den Ro Rand off childrens with you following our game I know a lot of the Duke fans want to stick around to watch the conversation with Roy Williams Mike Shashi and West Durham yeah moving that combo along between two coaching Legends and intense rivalry but theres so many layers you know one of the cool things youll see is how Mike shashy and Dean Smith how they saw their relationship grow over time and out to the point where they became friends even though they were Rivals well youre the respect comes I I think youre just such competitor at some point and and n greater than those two guys Coach K comes in as a competitor hes trying to establish himself hes trying to build this program and take it to new heights and he did so and you know you dont always have to dislike your opponent you just grow to respect them after a while and just two of the greatest basketball Minds the game has ever seen and had the privilege of playing as a player playing against both of those guys to show you how long they have been doing it and then being able to come back and Coach against those guys is just greatest those National Championship maners there in 1991 Ds First National Championship came at the expense of Roy Williams coach Kansas Applause yes D at 90 9192 backto back championship team with lakner and Grant Hill and Bobby Hurley and all those guys I give him crap every time I see him Thomas Hill those guys are unbelievable one of the best college teams that ever existed off balance proor one of my memories that still sticks from those teams it was the scowl that Cherokee Parks wore on his face remember Cherokee Parks just a lot of talented teams come in this building and I can imagine you can listen to coach Kay and coach Williams just for Applause hours that follows our game that conversation here on accn theyve done a tremendous job producing that piece Saturday weve got lacrosse here on accn number seven North Carolina the woman will host number five Notre Dame and then number eight jobs Hopkins jobs Hopkins is the the Notre Dame of college lacrosse they are quote unquote back this year theyll take on number two Virginia the Cavaliers national champions in 2019 2021 lost in the nationville semifinals to Notre D last year as Tyler Johnson hits a three and Friday got Duke and Penn who will go at it Duke right now the number one team in the country I told you i get across they did I hope you got to Scot him important today I mean all you over there talking to coach it is a loaded team that they have McCain Baseline Drive proor and he get fouled nope stepped down the line Philip palowski on the bench he did pick up his fourth foul Im not sure he comes back in Ryan young is out there Mitchells had a really nice game 14 points 19 for roach four off a career high and what is his 100th career start Trey Whites three not there Louisville two for 16 from three and boy its been an issue of late the last four games now Louisville is 12 of 60 from threepoint range they have struggles I I think all year its just not the strength of this Applause team good idea by Johnson kick ball I think one thing about this lisal team that thats needs to be said as well is that this team is really young and and they get a lot of credit you know its not our job to talk about what happens in the future with this with the coaching staff but I I think they are better than they year they were a year ago I just think the times that were living in everyone wants the results to be now they want them quicker and this is a really young team and theyre young in an age in college athletics when its hard to field young teams because you have guys with extra years and covid years and theres teams out there where fifth and sixth year seniors 23 24 25 years old sometimes yeah its like imagining this blue level Team without the guy with the ball in his hand R I dont know where theyd be without him I mean they be good and this is among this is with McDonalds all Americans and this would be a totally different team that one went through Clark the Miss by McCain and Duke is one of you know couple of programs in the country want to throw Kentucky maybe Kansas out there Applause where you can reset your roster every year with really highend freshman but thats not this due team do they have a talented Freshman Class yes think about who they brought back they brought back roach and Mitchell filipowski and proor this Duke team brought back more Main Stays than most Duke teams have in recent memory they have and and you just get so many you know you need to have an experien team and a guy like roach and Ryan young to kind of hold things down 349 to go in regulation Blue Devils on the verge of a double bu oh Harbys brown sugar Music bacon you always know

greates are challenged the playoff push is coming the time is Music Applause now Applause finish once again following our game its coach Kan Roy Williams Rivals reunited a 1hour sit down with the two coaching Legends in front of a I guess you can call it live studio audience at the Greensboro Coliseum how about bravery right there those North Carolina fans now they did pick the right seating section yeah they Louisville bench behind the Louisville bench in a sea of red but to where that shade of blue here that that takes some golf yeah that thats some somebodys got to investigate that and find out whats going on thats maybe early recruiting ahead of the game they might be over trying to figure some things out hey Coach pay whats what do we need to do to help the tower Hills Mitchell theres that Lind drive three how about this Rand hes hit nine threes on the season five of them have come in the last five games well one thing hes doing is hes starting out in that dunker spot getting comfortable and before I think hes started early in the year he was starting out behind the threepoint line now hes starting out inside hes forcing you to guard him and then hes getting in the floow of the game and its allowing him to get comfortable and knock down an occasion of three Clark turns it over Duke is nine of 17 from three make it 10 of 18 as CER with his first triple hes got eight welcome contest number two J turns one here clear to bench and Lille didnt get back in transition and blue that was with a three on two and it was either going to be Proctor or McCain getting that three and didnt want to rotate off McCain so Proctor knocks it down and its one of those pick your poison situation when you guard this group Duke has hit 10 or more threes 11 times now this season as Clark drills it fourth game in a row where Duke is hit at Le 10 threes and its the fourth game in a row where Louisville has given up at least 10 threes now theyre a difficult team to press because of the amount of handlers and thats the one thing I think you can look at tonight the Blue Devils had 10 turnovers in the first half only three in the second half and thats what this team typically looks like Proctor lets it Fly Young the offensive rebound those right back UPS Stewart skies and now Applause Johnson Clark down the lane the drop off for Hunley Hatfield who slams it over Stewart heart Rand off for Duke as we head into the home stretch of the Season theyve got Virginia NC State and UNC and then the ACC tournament what are your big questions for Duke moving forward besides the health of K Foster I think the bench is the biggest concern you got to have they theyre better defensively than you you think theyre not they dont pressure you as much as they have in years in the past theyre more in gaps keep you in front rebound the basketball we know about their efficiency on the offensive end of the floor you know with the Cato Foster injury thats big you see Ryan young Off the Bench hes scoring there and hes usually that left shoulder guy and he brings a lot of physicality and energy to the group but he doesnt bring a lot of Point production and as they enter March ACC tournament and NCAA what type of reduction are they going to get coming from the bench it puts a tremendous amount of pressure from the starters to just score so much thats a tough spot former walk on Spencer Hub who got a big Applause when he came into the game number 55 walkon comes in hey try to keep up with Tyler Johnson yeah that thats unfair hadnt even got loose in one trip in and you got that guy coming at you with a full ahead of steam at least youre in the books you get the foul thats right there you go they know you played now its documented that youve been in hovered 58 167 senior out of Los Angeles give him a ball screen oh the crowd wants to see Hub make one yeah hes going to get the ball here they going to get it to him running ball soon he been on the scout team power for Applause three now this place will erupt if Hub knock down a basket get it to him trying to deny him there it is here comes H down the lane power again three Steward another rebound and he puts it home even though this game is out of hand thats what you want to see from Stewart and pal just taking shots with confidence and Stewart defending like this on the ball I thought it was good defense and going to the offensive glass in the previous possession dont look at the score just continue to play continue to show things and force coach to play you in moments that it matter you got to show him in moments where it doesnt matter like like now the Stewart tonight nine points eight rebounds you know the tal there and and what he does is you dont need to generate offense for him run offensive plays for him hes hes cutting off the ball on the weak side getting dunks getting offensive rebounds and thats okay hes just an elite athlete with thats his superpower right now he has to develop continue to develop the skill set thatll come productive minutes for tonight now Tyler Johnson doesnt want to give anything to hubard he lets it play Oh but there comes off the ball screen no rotation he knocks it down and the camon are going crazy as they should its a great sight to see one of the lost arts with so much going on in college athletics now wearing about net rankings the WalkOns dont get to play as much anymore and what a moment you got to be so happy for this young man that was the loudest its been in here all night with the game out of hand this entire crowd and especially the crazies wanted to see Spencer Hub get his I dont think everyone understands how hard they work they do everything else that everyone does and I wish we could get back to that maybe shorten the method the number whatever that number is shorten it you know if its 30 shorten it to 20 whatever it is so we can have more moments like this in college athletics this is what its about for people like that theyll never forget those moments and you can see what it does to the crowd he wont shoot this though hell hold it when you played what was that like on the bench when a theres nothing better than that they work so hard you know how much work they put in they do everything you get to do without those opportunities theyre few and far you owe it to them to get them on the floor great job by his teammates tonight Spencer Hub puts the exclamation point on a convincing Duke when the Blue Devils clinching wa
