how about tomorrow Monsanto a threepoint threat hes made 84 and that leads the conference in that category Kevin Keats the head coach of the wolf pack Beats at his sixth year and hes got a big man on the inside DJ Burns watch for number 30 he goes 69 275 and shoots 57 from the floor third best in the ACC Wake Forest in the black NC State white and red and here we go with ACC basketball and immediately you see the match up that weve been talking about from the beginning jaquel joined a meeting Tyler yet the above half court NC State with those throwback 1983 uniforms poked away on the inside and Hilder saves it Chris Carr drops it low got it back and car lays it in nice interior passing between Marsh and Carr to be able to get the easy bucket and thats one of the areas where Wake Forest will try to attack NC State up front to see if they can get DJ Burns and just a foul trouble wolf pack coming off that huge emotional win on Sunday against visiting North Carolina 7769 four you were in the building it was an energetic atmosphere for college basketball it was the electric in this building talking to some of the fans earlier as theyre getting low in the shot call DJ Burns get into that patented left hand jump hook and youre talking about a young man who had a strong performance against Wake Forest first time out 31 points for him and off to a great start here and that was January 28th and Winston the sale of the twopoint win for NC State as Barnes led the way with a gamehigh 31 points as Corey mentioned the Applebee pass goes nowhere heres Smith Joyner from Moline Music last three games for Joyner despite that Miss Corey averaging 23 points and scores for truck held running hes just passed the time and a lot of it has to do with the fact that hes struggled with the two games prior to that as cam hell just gets downhill and is able to finish off the glass winning his match up oneonone Music Smith know where to go NC State shot 45 for the game against the Tar Heels 64 percent in the second half to outlast North Carolina burns the twisting shot he gave him a little shoulder and a little shimmy endemic conversation with the student section with the fans showing up of course DJ burns the people saying fear of PNC Arena the transfer from Winthrop out of Rock Hill South Carolina shooting a ridiculous 63 percent in his last four games Appleby stumbles down the foul is going to go against Smith DJ Burns who catches the basketball often beyond the threepoint line backs his Defender down and of course we saw the jump hook prior and then its simply a Little Dream shake the fall away and hes a guy that loves to have fun on social media from the 1983 team says if you cant make it to the game Im not disappointed but I want you to come out and support the pack yeah of course he wants to make sure hes the guy that does at all its Harry Appleby becomes that God doing it all night he got his first three but DJ Burns he not only wants to perform on the court he wants to make sure he invites everyone to see his performance Appleby knows all about threepointers how about 258 for his collegiate career for the graduate student a couple of years of Florida burns the fake Marsh defended it well when you see early Steve four is going to allow DJ Burns to work oneonone hes got a compliment of strippers Hildreth all the way to the rim Cameron hildren is aggressive and you one of the things weve got to talk about when you look at this game today youre seeing the two guys in the ACC that have had a triple double this season Cameron Hilder for Wake Forest and of course Raquel Joyner to NC State Joyner did it against Syracuse thats a foul on the shot by Smith score of the bucket foreign we have a treat tonight weve got three of the top four scores in the ACC on the floor tonight to quavion Smith the sophomore continues to be impressive drawing the attention of Wake Forest best perimeter Defender and Cameron Hildreth but gets the bucket and the opportunity for the end one Smith at the freethrow line the software from Greenville North Carolina already gone over a thousand points in his NC State Career took only 58 games to do that and he completes the old school threepoint play coming out the 12point performance against North Carolina Corey but he missed call Four of his threepoint attempts but he also made plays for his teammates hes not just a guy that scores hes one of the top assist guys with ACC as well that will be again for free hell get over at the student section well again hes seen DJ Burns doing so therefore tyrees going to make sure he has a little conversation Music Jamie lucky on the whistle on a foul coming up against Wake Forest thats going to be Zach Keller number 25 his first and we mentioned the compliment of five men of centers as Steve Forbes has to throw at DJ Burns weve got Bradford also but Kevin is going to be out quickly just picked up his second foul after just stepping on the court hes a young man that hasnt played much as of late but has a number of starts to his credit this season Keller seeing action in his 14th game this season Steve Forbes head coach for wake and the coach of the year in the ACC a season ago his team trying to make some noise at the tournament how about Jack Clark straight away for three Zach clock in his fourth game back abs and close to 10 points per game in those games and youre talking about a young man that missed 10 games Kevin Keats and the fan base here very happy to have him back in the lineup Jack Clark missed those 10 games but Corey had mentioned with a core muscle injury suffered against Clemson here in Raleigh on December 30th this time he does it in front of the pack bench but the small Mistake by Clark he tried to shoot through the gap on the screen giving Tyree Appley more than enough space youve got a trail and run him off the line he is three for three from Beyond The Arc this is Keller against Burns leading in and scoring Applause six points now for DJ Burns Applause thank you Applause Monsanto Applause Appleby tough Catch and Release and his first Miss Cara preserves The Possession are leaning in the transfer from Delaware has got to nice Patience by Andrew Carr recognizes hes got the smaller jacquel Joyner on him goes to the post and is able to finish off the second chance pool bar is a doubledigit score on the season 113 points per game oh Joiner elevates and hits talking to jacquel join a pregame I talked about youve got another big time match up here tonight he said oh yeah thats my guy he is how we have to go back to the SEC days together but I said to him well thats the best one to go at you gotta go with your friends even more Santo for three Music Applause wherever one of the things we talked about prior to the game was this would be a high scoring game and it has been just that early and John Cal Joyner gets downhill one of the things was certain jacquel Joyner is not going to be the guy that just sits back on the loud side of the apathy to go at him hes going to go back Joyner is closing in on 2 000 points in his collegiate career as Corey mentioned he played at Ole Miss Appleby played at Florida so their paths have crossed in the past and already once this season a win for NC State in WinstonSalem and a foul call and thatll go against the pack endtoend action Corey Alexander absolutely DJ Burns getting it going early but Tyree Appleby has the answer knocking down not one not two but continues to knock down the three balls three threepointers already for Tyree Appleby in the first six and a half minutes of this game and hes off to a great start the accs leading scorer with nine points already and continues to be aggressive attacking the basket as well hanging out there with official Jamie lucky and the 1983 team being honored tonight Sydney low on the left Earl Bailey also there pulls out McQueen what a team of Destiny Sidney Lowe the MVP of the ACC tournament that year when they beat Virginia in the championship game and then had to play Virginia in the regional final as well I can remember watching that entire NCAA tournament watching that ACC Tournament of course the Golden Era of ACC basketball Music Applause patted around Burns able to Corral it so before the break to quavion Smith picked up a second personal foul so right now he is on that pack bench by the way the teams combined right now 83 shooting and its going to get a little bit better if thats the Joyner what were seeing right now is quick on quick when you look at jaquel Joyner in the matchup with Tyree Appleby both these guys lightning quick and Ultra aggressive six points now for Joyner that was Appleby fouled on the Move top of the key this is almost impossible to guard you see jarkel Joyner in just the half step setting up Tyree Appleby getting right downhill for the Easy Button Applause like Clark picked up the foul for NC State his first Music on the drive and a quick layup by hildred Cameron Hildreth is set just a third attack for him getting downhill getting to the basket he continues to be aggressive as well taking on some of the pressure off the top reopsy not to have to beat everything on the offensive end six points for Hildreth who had that triple double against Hampton earlier this season Marcel got it back driving to the rim aggressively more south you know if there were ever in time to flex that would have been it Casey Marcel taking on all the contact at The Rim yeah not to turn normally Marcel likes to step back into threepoint real estate hes 43 of the Season decided to drive it and the result was good this is marsh Applause I mean when I say this number I know where youre going to say many people will not believe me Matthew Marsh is shooting 91 from the field this season not in ACC play on the season now granted most of the time hes relatively close 91 percent Music thats about what wake is shooting right now too 91 percent as Monsanto took the shot its a threesecond violation against Wake Forest Derek Wittenberg to Lorenzo Charles at The Rim it was in the past it was a pass no it was not Joyner stepping back Appleby grabs it finishing to see how long Kevin Applause Smith on the bench 1119 remaining here in this first half and of course Im sure coach Trust his Dynamic scoring guard to be able to play without fouling at some point here in this first half wake turning it over for the third time so far in the half Santo hit the deck in a whistle only got a second lets check out the Ford keys to the game with Corey Alexander well for the Wake Forest Demon Deacons they have to take care of the Basketball 19 turnovers against Miami led to 34 points the last time out and for NC State theyve got to defend without fouling because Wake Forest is one of the best in the ACC especially Tyree Appleby of getting to the freethrow line foul was on Gowana against NC State heres Appleby Applause car on a spin take it away Joiner accelerating leading the break and a whistle on the driving attempt at The Rim Ernest Ross that is the most underrated part of darkell joyners game is what he does defensively you see him taking on a much taller Defender but using his quickness not only to steal the basketball but to get some offense going at the other end Ernest Ross gets to the freethrow line because of time because of darkell joyners defensive effort so Ross at the line 57 from the stripe of the season his best game this year had to be the OT win against visiting Miami Ross in that game 17 points and nine boards both career highs for him yeah talking with Josh Im sorry with Coach L after that game he simply said we game plan for everyone we were not expecting 17 points for Ernest Ross and again when Ernest Ross comes up and has a big game like that normally youre not going to be able to beat so you saw Hildreth leave the game with two personal fouls hes got six points second leading scorer behind Applebees got nine Applebees connected on three threepoint tries on four attempts Damian Williamson was committed the game for Wake Forest Ron Gruber calls the foul but you see Tyree Africa continues to rack up the fouls on NC State hes in constant motion and he has the basketball in his hands so much but the highest usage Race by far in ACC basketball and continues to put pressure on the wrist I was knocked out around by Thomas trying to recover with the Appleby driveby so Thomas picked up that last personal foul his first and Thomas comes on the floor and gives Raquel Joyner a bit of a break having to defend half of it Applebys pass kicked off by Joyner challenging mark off the glass at him what a luxury for Kevin Keats to win your leaders scored the crazy hospital gets into foul trouble you can continue to rely on jaquel Joyner the grad transfer guard ACC player of the week who is taking over this game not offensively but defensively as well thats now nine points for Joyner 84 from the freethrow line ninth best in the conference and Joyner by the way now Corey has made 39 of his last 40 free throw attempts Applebee out of a congested area in a car who hits a three ball tarry Appleby getting into the teeth and defense remains patient even though hes amongst the trees keeps his eyes up head up and finds the shooter Beyond 30 seven points for Andrew Carr 31st made three of the season with double on burns or sell the catch and release foreign makes it a onepoint game Applause shot clock for 10 for Appleby Escape dribble gets the jumper away batting around taken by Ross two on one China foreign Applause Music run down by Ross and he saved it on the sideline and right now they say mismatch for Joyner he wants everybody to get out of the way and blow the doors off a car I see what you did there by the way Joyner could not quite get the engine revved up to full capacity Applebee the other way perimeter work by weight Williamson can shoot for three hes made over 200 in his career how about Clinton extending the range Bobby Clinton is stepping up hes been getting much more minutes as of late the only player for Wake Forest who did not score in double figures in their game against Miami however he was the only guy in double figures rebounding continues to play better basketball early in his career and he just deflected that one out of bounds 12 points or eight points rather and 12 rebounds a career high for Clinton who just hit it three his 20th of the season thats been the difference in this game right now six of nine from Beyond the threepoint Arc as you see our guy touring Dorne former ACC Big Time Hooper here with NC State stocking up jarkel Joyner and Joyner playing without we play Beyond Smith early in this half has already picked up the two foul Music Derek Wittenberg thurl Bailey Terry Gannon in the background good seats tonight right behind that back bench for the 1983 National Championship team that well deserved and being honored this evening there will be a ceremony at halftime Music Thomas off the glass calculates the angle OJ Thomas has given Kevin Keats a lot of good minutes here with the Cleveland Smith on the bench coming in defending Tyree Appleby and now adding to the offensive end as well Monsanto on the handoff releasing the three front rim Applause and they might have got Clinton in there Corey on the glass first on Clinton wormy NC State leads to ACC and fewest allow threepoint field goals per game and percentage at just over 30 percent but they only normally give up right under six threepoint field goals a game Wake Forest already over that number with six so one of the things that Kevin Keith talked to was pregame about theyve got to keep them off the line hasnt been able to have success with that so far Barnes gets a rise from the crowd backing his way down to the block Burns off the glass nothing you can do the third Defender is Davion Bradford steps up to take the challenge of guarding DJ Burns hes already dealt with Marsh and caliper and now is Bradfords turn to be able to get some of that medicine theres nothing you can do if youre not going to send a trap youre not going to have success stopping DJ Burnham eight points now for burns Bradford is in the game little golden block number 20 shot clocked out of five for Appleby in the entry Radford trying to get around Burns doesnt get the roll Applause Joyner five of nine from the floor and 11 points only player double digits so far here in the first half Music Applause Burns has a chance to join him in double figures got fouled by a defending Bradford thank you PJ Burns going to get to the free throw line the first matchup between these two teams NC State was seven of 16 from the freethrow line DJ Burns three of eight and it was not their strength and has not been their strength this season 23 points in the second half of that game for burns while we have a moment a message from Coyote Tractor my experience if you work the land you got to be a jack of all trades you got to have a little bit of optimism a lot of getgo DJ Burns over 1400 points in his college career playing his 119th game with Kevin Keats right now content to teach a crazy on Smith on the bench brionne pass getting his opportunity to get into the game for the first time for the pack just three points for Smith and we played six minutes so far with the two fouls this is Applebee cluttered area Williamson Clinton that was textbook defense by darkell Joyner on that last possession mark lets it Fly long rebounder Joyner reloads and theyre actually going to get Casey Marcel for offensive foul on that one trying to set the screen to keep Tyree Appleby away from Draco Joyner who picked up the offensive rebound first foul against Marcel you see the offensive rebound coming off Casey Marcel trying to just get in the way I dont hate the call Im sure it wouldnt be a popular fall in this building Wake Forest got six made threes on 11 tries they average just over nine per game thats the best in the NCT theyre going up top with Marsh on the business end but the beautiful find from Tyree Appleby we mentioned before thats the reason why Marsh is shooting 91 from the fourth all high percentage shots Marsh is two for two a couple of dunks right back to Marcel attacking the rim held ball the arrow favors NC State great job defensively by both Carr and Mars going up vertically not allowing Casey Marcel to get that shot off uncharacteristic airball by Marcel but gets it back a nice offensive rebound by Jack Clark but great job defensively by the team of Defense to keep him away from the basket deep into the shot clock for burns off the double clock saved that with the block Bob may have gotten a piece of that one Music inside four and a half minutes to go and a rapid first half of play hell drip a little followup Applause lets see state is a team at 61 from the floor way above their season average of 45 seventh in the copper Burns midrange DJ Barnes can do that as well he has the touch to be able to stretch it out well beyond the freethrow lines knock down those midrange jump shots makes him even more dangerous 12 points for burns 20th time this season hes got a double figures in scoring Applebee trainer Applause fast break points Galore for the wolf pack congratulating his teammates hes still engaged involved in this game whether hes on the floor or not second leading scorer in the ACC this season hes played in just seven minutes so far in the first half Pilgrim back to the basket against the double team got the defenders in the air and Marsh follows with the rim Bender Matthew Moss continues to stay perfect was a perfect five for five against Miami perfect three for three here today and again high quality high percentage shots for him 72 of 79 were inside of three minutes to go in the first half hell drift to clearance one of the best rebounding guards in the ACC Hill just can rebound it and also push it make plays on the other hand for the Demon Deacons allowing him to play fast Monsanto Music accs leader in threepoint field goals made per game 323 made a game and of course he will let it fly doesnt have to be open to let it fly 86 made threes so far this season tomorrow Monsanto best in the ACC Joyner hangs and scores Applause 13 first half points Runner Music Mildred not defended thats a fair shot they simply said we dared you shoot it of course Cameron Hill can make threes steps up knocks it down right in front of Kevin Keith Joseph had only made 15 for the end of the game at the other end its Joyner fouled in the active shooting Applause well if you love great guard play this is the game to watch between jarkel Joyner and what hes been able to get done on the floor Tyree Appleby on the other end as well as Cameron Hilder but Joyner has been the star it was Tyree Appleby to start the game off but ever since then jaquel Joyner has taken over Applause steam points now for Joyner pretty much right on his season average with 166 per game tied for seventh for the ACC Music ENT big upset in the ACC tonight Corey Boston College at home with Connie Forum with a victory over number six Virginia 6348 Virginia the highest ranked ACC team but think about that one Virginia scored 48 points in that game right now North Carolina state has 44 points we still have them in the 45 remaining that is a major difference in contrast of the game that were seeing here compared to what happened at Copper Forum earlier this evening keep in mind Wake Forest averages 78 points per game that is third in the ACC with Hildreth at the free throw line Applause were coming up on the Toyota halftime report well show you the 40th anniversary celebration of the 83 National Championship team for NC State your highlights and stats with Corey Alexander what a night inside PNC Arena wait I got to work half of them I mean you can stick around if you want to uh Id love to have it I got to talk to somebody I mean come on yeah and I agree to work with you Applause DJ Burns still working for NC State on the spin against Marsh but thats the Dilemma when you play against NC State you cant allow DJ Burns to just back you down youve seen he will dominate you in the post if you just allow him to play oneonone but also he welcomes the double team he wants the double team to happen and hes looking for you to come track enjoys passing the basketball getting his teammates Great Looks Marsh picked up his second personal foul with Burns at the free throw line 63 for the stripe of the season number 13 for DJ Burns he is above his season average per game of 12 and a half but whats his average in 2023 its been two seasons for DJ Burns so when you look back into what happened you know for NC State leading up to December 30th and then ever since then hes been a different guy hes had extended minutes with dushan mahorsich out with a kneecap injury and burns has the spawning absolutely people thought Kevin Gooch was crazy for going out and not signing one but two centers in the transfer portal and now you see who of course Kingstons had a lot of bad luck with injuries one of the reasons why he did so and hes coming into position where DJ Burns playing great basketball Kevin Keats trying to get this team back to the NCAA tournament clocked a steal from the bounce pass is rust with the hammer foreign to with the response for three love is confidence not concerned about the crowd not concerned about anything other than squaring his shoulders and knocking down a three to quiet PNC nine points Monsanto three threepoint baskets final 25 seconds left the defense of the Dustin laid it in Corey how about a joiner stepping up to quavion Smith missing the majority of the first half he has stepped up big time final seconds Monsanto on the handle lost it and went down touching his knee porcel easy Jam still point eight in the Gamecock Monsanto down behind the play Applause fell awkwardly and in some discomfort Music and Santo was clutching that left knee almost immediately as he tried to make the move saw his teammates Corey trying to help him up but he turned him away well this is the interesting part to see if he can put any pressure on that left leg gingerly walking off the floor right now to keep an eye on that and see as you mentioned optimally falling down dribbling Applause and you hate to see that young man whos been playing great basketball throughout this season already knocked down two huge threes to help his team here in this first half hopefully we will see him back in the second half we saw him at Notre Dame earlier this season Corey make eight threepointers he scored 28 points both career highs for Monsanto yeah five games this season where hes made six plus three pointers and again leading the ACC in threepoint field goal makes per game right now this equals the largest speed of the first half for NC State and they will take the lead to the locker room and unfortunately for Coach Fords his best threepoint shooter just went down and well see if Monsanto can get back into the lineup for Wake Forest from the second half by the way NC State this season 181 with the halftime lead so strong at home theyre 14 when coach Norm Sloan recruited me and uh after our freshman year you know he got a job in Florida and uh were sitting with our arms crossed and demeanor like winning listening we dont want to hear whats coming up and some some uh really confident Italian guy walked into the room and sold us a bill of goods and said guys look you know Im going to win the national champions I thought it was kind of selfish she says Im going to win a National Championship and he did he said just give me 25 minutes you made that speech we all bought in um and again that Journey doesnt happen unless we struggle right so it took us a little while but that last year probably one of the toughest schedules in the country Carolina top you know top three or four with the junior top three or four and so we struggled we lost Eric Wittenberg for a bit but then you then you without Dereks injury we dont get the Ernie Myers we dont get to Lorenzo Charles where theyll get the best of those guys so things start to come together and and of course we have to win the ACC tournament really to have a significant chance of getting them into double a train so yeah we struggled but we dont have a story like this without that struggle youve got a chance to talk to the team yesterday what was your message to these young guys and you talk about 40 years have passed since you have played here what is your message to these young guys here now 40 years later guys every time they walk into that practice facility they see a couple banners up on them they want that you know like we wanted it and I told them you know theres a lot its been talked about the game is the game because I said guys is is Clark is an awkward hit trying to hang on the rim to avoid some contact it looked like Music Clark doing what hes been doing since getting back coming up with the Steal and in that scenario whenever you know that you lost balance you gotta hang on the rim and not wanting to get the technical foul especially the only guy to buy your fingertips let that thing go absolutely and thats one where you hate to see that fall no foul play no dirty play on that that was simply just losing his balance not been able to hang on the rim and a young man who missed 10 games just his fourth game back you hate to see him having to deal with this right now hopefully hes able to get up and be okay Music Music Applause everything so Clark is still Seated on the Baseline coach Keiths over there as well encouraging sign though hes sitting up now getting up walking off on his own power so glad to see that for Jack Clark yeah and I could tell when we went to practice if these guys are connected in a special way you know I saw a lot of similarities and again basketball is basketball but off the court is where you really make that Bond a lot of times and thats what I think our team had that was special I see a lot of that in this team as well and not just what your team had but what your team has its great to see you guys getting together of course a number of your guys no longer with us have passed on but at the same time those who are able still showing up that you guys you know well connected still throughout you know text messaging calling to set another you guys make sure to stay in contact with that we do we do and that thats really the special part of it that was so many years ago 40 years yeah I dont even think youre 40 years old I actually know how old he is I wont say it right now but thorough we thank you so much and you enjoy the moment and its great to be with your teammates obviously and who knows what this wolf pack team may do this season hey nothings impossible guys you know that they know that thank you for being an example my man thank you appreciate it appreciate it thank you so much thanks for stopping by all right the officials are over at the scorers table just taking a look at that previous play and when again we thank thorough Bailey for stopping by and talking with us thorough part of that 1983 National Championship team does some television work with the Utah Jazz the officials so popular officers come away from that theres nothing there and again there was no contact on that play that was simply just you know Jack Clark and I honestly believe that he was trying to hang on the rim but his fingers slipped off of the rim his attempt was to hang on knowing that his body was in a controlled position hopefully well see that young man if not back on the floor today back this weekend came down on his shoulder and held so hopefully hell get further evaluation and well check out Clarks status momentarily foreign Music Applause Music Applause Smith lines up with three unable to knock it down but gets his own rebound the dju is positioning to get his rebound how about more cell than its all net right in front of his own fence Second Chance points for the Wolfpack Marsh on an alleyoop again I tell you what if youre Matthew boss you have to love playing alongside a guy like Tyree Appleby knowing that every time he goes to the rim its a live opportunity for you Mars deflected its a car monsters now four for four and four dunks and eight points Applause Appleby trying to work out the March screen lost the handle up ahead Smith oneonone with Carl the Euro Step out of bounds and it will stay with NC State so Demari Monsanto who went out he was touching his left knee on an awkward move out on the perimeter hes back on the bench for Wake Forest well see if hes able to reenter the game Jack Clark who just came down hanging on the rim and then hit the floor had to go back to the dressing room for further evaluation so both teams Music misses badly on that one Smith wide open on the other side was jumping up and down looking for that basketball will be Wake Forest ball seven point lead for the pass Smith lines it up not sit down Music welcome to basketball in 2023 to clavia Smith comes up with a huge steal and instead of taking it to the rim just hangs out around a threepoint line stops pops and its so much pressure on the opposing teams point guards two steals to him already in this game but its more so the pressure Tyler who got off to a great start nine points for him early in this game hasnt been able to get going offensively ever since the first four minutes apple United his first three threepoint attempts Music 18 points for Joyner that leads everybody his teammates more cell and burns are in double digits Appleby and hilltrip doubledigit scores Wake Forest in possession of the basketball four turnovers for the deeps in the last three minutes Music Applause both of the meetings during the regular season last year twopoint loss at home to NC State earlier this season Applause nice Patience by car once again to allow Ernest Ross to get in the air the pump fake gets him in the air and waiting for him to jump and then the second guy off the floor but the first guy to finish nine points now for Andrew Carr much needed bucket Wake Forest differences eight through the Williamson double produced Williamson behind the line for a three foot weight for us and a knockdown shooter you lose one shot four the second half David Williamson steps into the lineup picks up the effort from Beyond a threepoint Arc Wake Forest continues to shoot the basketball great from Beyond The Arc first points of the game Damien Williamson Applause Music Taps it up to Williamson Music Applebee has deflected by Marcel Smith chugs his way up the middle of the court and a foul called as he attacked the rim Applause so foul on the demon Deeks Carr will pick it up his first 75 and under makes you a quad one if youre able to get a win on the world well Im sorry that would actually give NC State a quad one win if Wake Forest is a 75 or under the win for NC State in WinstonSalem becomes a quad one win because they went in and beat a team at home so again the net ranking none of us really understand it and we dont understand what its used for but the eye test this Wake Forest Demon Deacon team has played very good basketball throughout this year one of the best offensive teams youll see in the league Music Wake Forest 1710 on the season nine and seven in conference play trying to get back to the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2017 when they did that that was the first time since 2010 that they got into the tournament Marcel his third DJ burnford trying to get the crowd not to talk about the officials right now he loved the relationship that DJ Burns has built with the student section and the crowd here at PNC just in his first season with the Wolfpack Music equipment to Marsh tough catch out of bounds that plays a little different where I mean were coming from Bobby Clinton in comparison to Tyree Appleby Tyree Appleby knows exactly when to get to the right spot and oftentimes makes Defenders think that hes shooting the basketball allowing for Marks to get open as Appleby return will return to the game Steve Ford has seen enough for the installment Burns contact inside free throws upcoming the Wake Forest has now turned it over 12 times 19 turnovers Saturday at Miami that resulted in 34 points and a loss at number 15 Miami 9687 and burns to the freethrow line for NC State coming off of that incredible Victory on Sunday against North Carolina 7769 thank you look around the ACC with Virginia losing tonight Miami goes to first place in the ACC Pittsburgh is still in third but I believe Pitt will actually move ahead they have that headtohead win over Virginia I believe Pitt may actually go to second pushing Virginia to Third s in that fourth got a win tonight at NC State right now at fifth but looking to try to get in those top four spots to get that double by the ACC team Music 70th ACC tournament in Greensboro coming up in a couple of weeks 29th time at the Greensboro Coliseum shot clocks down to six for Hillcrest Music Ross deflected it demon thinks will not get a shot away Steve Forbes not happy about that not getting a shot attempt off but really when you look at these two teams this is the difference between the two both great scoring teams but what the wolf pack are able to do defensively forcing turnovers allows them to score in different ways turnovers in the game for Wake State on average forces about 10 thats third in the conference and thats burns turn around 17 points great Touch by the big fella around the back Applause steam parts now for NC State offered as Wake Forest turnovers Applause Music Hildreth one rebound almost sell the handoff Smith Music hes way behind the line but watch out for that shoelace as well for Smith again the pack with those throwback 1983 uniforms from the championship team honored at halftime 40th anniversary in the 1983 National Title against Houston in Albuquerque New Mexico Marsh both teams have pulled off since the presenters we saw from the shooting in the first half Applause Applebee Applause so Wake Forest now Glory down to 60 from the floor yeah down to six yeah NC State 57 percent Burns Bob Ross Music Kevin Keats on the floor pointing out that he felt like Carr was in the restricted area Music as we get a look Andrew Carr does a great job getting those heels outside of the restricted area great call Earl Walton right on top of it first foul on Joyner Smith tying up that shoe yeah you you brought that to everyones attention the official officials knew that Safety First exactly Safety First exactly you sound like someone whos falling down maybe at a church league game uncorks at three goes out of bounds and that is off of Wake Forest if that shot goes down we will be watching that highlight for a long time hell just actually threw the basketball off the back of Marcel because he couldnt get it in bounds smart play by Cameron Hilton thats a press breaker in itself sleight of hand from Hildreth Music 10 10 clock to 12 minutes deliberate possession from NC State buzzer strong up the glass and thats the luxury you have with your crazy honest with just a young man that can go out and get a bucket you dont need a screen you dont need to call to play for them you can just put the basketball in his hands and he can go get your points hes got nine in the game got 33 points earlier this season against Kauffman State the most by an NC State player father Miss Music Smith around hildred almost got it back heres Williamson Applause all right Applause Whitman went to the floor to try to take it back but the foul was called 70th ACC tournament Greensboro North Carolina work to be done between then and now for both of these clubs Music almost recovered there and the officials have whistlewake Forest profile you want to stay tuned for the fast break presented by your local Ford dealer stuck Corey Alexander hey I like it Clinton just picked up his fourth personal foul Steve Forbes will not like that we want you to stay tuned for the fast break take a look at some of the upcoming action in the original Sports Network Smith Music Applebee runs it up Applause a bit more cell to the rim it was deflected Applause an erratic possession right now for Wake Forest thats why you get the basketball this guys hitting its the Ernest Ross having none of it erasing that shot off the glass it was so almost stumbled down able to keep his footing but Virginia transfers second year in the NC State program thank you Williamson all over Joyner finally shakes him bounces off to Hildreth far and Gowana kind of got tangled up a little bit there and again a contrasts and styles for NC State right they were doing it offensively in the first half this second half its been about their defense thats allowed them to build this 11point lead havent been making shots but theyre not allowed to wait for it to score either its a mini 60 run for NC State with awakened possession in Clinton rolls out of bounds and stays at the center of the floor but another strong defensive stand only four and a half seconds remaining on the shot clock for the Damon deacons to try to get a good look here and give the wolf pack a lot of credit for the way they lock down defensively late in the shot clock for Wake which had one three in a row clouds of the loss at Miami on Saturday Williamson fires out of the corner Marsh keeps it alive Music all right trying to get to the rim and Tawana and Ross in the neighborhood tell you what thats a lot of skill for a 610 guy to be able to make that move nice ball handling by Andrew Carr the behind the back and then able to get to the rim trying to finish it over top of two shot blockers for the wolf pack gets the foul opportunity to put two points on the board first foul on Ross puts prior to figure line first attempts for the evening in fact wake had only been to the line four times before that trip by car who is now in double digits with 10 on the made free throw for it but thats such a strong component of Wake Forest and what they do you go back and look at the first matchup between these two teams go for us outscored NC State by 12 at the free throw line so again thats one of the Staples of Steve Forbes offense especially with Tyree Appley getting downhill and attacking the basket heres the stat for you warning in the last four games coming into this one NC state has taken 27 totals in free throws Tyree Appleby took 28 by himself against North Carolina and May 23 of those 28 attempts both of those numbers by the way ACC records that is Smith on a deep three Pilgrim took it all the way to the bucket and we saw a lot of that from Camry hildes in the first half attacking the basket getting downhill using that size and strip to score over the Defenders of NC State and now a seven point game Wade four starting to find some momentum 13 points for Hildreth Williamson Smith aggressive defending shot clocks at 10 Burns a mile from the rim seven on the shot clock by the way Appleby has not gone to the freethrow line in this game Corey when that was one of the keys for NC State to be able to defend without fouling Applause now the DJ Burns get an assist with that hes at home generous scoring great Gantz one basket and hes above his season average with points my guy John Badger give me the thumbs down like hes not having a car that was online is the hair too strong Smith wants it over Applebee Applause 11 points for Smith double digits 28 times this season Applause thank you hell be leaned in again thatll be three free throws on the crafty play by Applebee Music 7059 the wolf pack got in front of the demon Deeks here is the drive presented by Defender sequavion Smith getting out in the fast breaks how do you have to be hustling back with nothing to do with chakravion getting to the rim and finishing it off getting himself in the double figures and building the lead to 11 the sophomore from Greenville North Carolina second leading scorer in the ACC Music last year he made 96 threepointers to lead the conference came into the evening with 80 made Crews with the Cleveland Smith Applause Music Applause added one to the total tonight with Appleby at the freethrow line Force right now started off this game and making nine of their first 15 threepoint Showdown attempts in the first half second half only one of nine theyre going to have to find the range from Beyond The Arc to be able to get back into this game simply because right now theyre struggling to stop the wolf back on the other end third free throw for Appleby he was fouled before the break on the threepoint shot 14 points Tyree Appleby as a team wake his second best for the ACC threepoint shooting 37 on the season that goes out about Burns could not handle the pass a little bit of frustration yeah Kaylas turnover right there about to quayvion Smith and DJ Burns Im not sure which one will get the turnover but Kevin Keats immediately getting darkell Joyner the point guard back on the floor and amazing when you look at this you know North Carolina State team although Joyner is more the point guard so play Beyond Smith is a leading assist guy for this team so again they share the responsibility with the ball in the head trying to keep his footing handling property thats the first missed shot for Matthew Marsh in the last two games Applause and this is about the time of the game on Sunday where jaquel Joyner took off and NC State made 12 of the last 13 field goals to only miss was a missed dunk by Ernest Ross on The Fast Break 21 points for 200 he reads Everybody with that figure that was his first three of the game hes one for five through threepoint distance Applause cards Rising into traffic a little late on that but darkiel got him that one I believe we researched team to play down and pulled up yeah comes flying out of nowhere Paul did not hit the rim Joyner Target Music Applause 29 Points in the win against North Carolina hes got 23 tonight Music Appleby with a kind bounce Music jarkel Joyner got an opportunity to get a little bit of a rest Kevin Keys got him out of the game and of course he comes back in with fresh legs able to pull up from three knock it down in transition and then getting off the pick and roll getting to his midrange where hes been dangerous all night long knocks down to two see in the back of the Huddle there number five with the sling left shoulder injuries Jack Clark obviously will not return he went in for a gym earlier and a half and tried to brace himself tried to hang onto the rim he just couldnt he fell awkwardly for it but you think about what he brings to this lineup his ability to shoot the three and of course the offensive rebounding and the steals an energy guy who can score at that four position right now of course Greg Ernest Rosso Dies who can give him the defensive side but they dont do offensively what Zach Park does this NC State team getting a lot better with Jack Clark in the mix in the lineup hopefully well get a chance to see him back soon theres a transfer from the south hes already missed 10 games this season with a poor muscle injury towards the unit five and a half minutes to game regulation Joyner even though the pass was way off to his left didnt stop the flow in the rhythm of the shotgun and thats three straight buckets by jacquel Jordan we talked about the performance he had to end the game against North Carolina when they ended on a 2915 run and drop down Joiner with the cow in the second half of that game 26 points for Joyner and thats Appleby at the other end for the Demon Deacons and thats not good as important as Tyree Appleby is to this team seeing him with any type of injury any type of ailment theres a level of concern for Steve Fordson as he gets downhill not sure what happened on that its a call to discomfort but after we still had the concentration to be able to finish an 84 percent freethrow shooter Applause three or four from the line for Appleby and all those tries coming to the second half Christmas attempted and made trying to recover and catch Joyner Music Burns puts it on the floor and a big Flex from the big man 19 points Burns DJ Burns is so skilled you look at his opportunity facing up Marsh just shows that pump they puts it on the floor and going to that dominant left hand and of course always willing to flex and go over and hang out with his teammates of course he has fit in so well here at NC State Music despite the best 19 points Music and from the floor Music 56 shooting NC State 53 with Forest Appleby thats a tough shot by Tyler but its a tough shot because jockel Joyner does the job fighting over the screen and forcing him to have to step back and get the shot off wake me 15 threes in the loss to Miami it wasnt enough theyve made 11 tonight and its an uphill climb with 417 to go for Wake Forest trailing 8067 coach Keats took the program to the NCAA tournament back in 2018 his first year the return Burns could be a big factor you cannot guard him oneonone I dont care who you are youre not guarding him oneonone youve got to bring the double team and when you do he is a willing and excellent passer hildrift calls a timeout nowhere to go foreign ER but right now is the DJ Burns Coyote Tractor turning point and the turning point was when Kevin Kiest decided to put darkell Joyner back in the game it was an eightpoint lead for NC State and a 70 run by darkell Joyner increased the lead to 15 just like that 26 points to lead everybody jockel Turner that includes a couple of threes and 11 of 19 from the floor children around the curl Williamson tees up a three Applause Music NC States wants six of its last eight games seven in a row Quarry at home against ACC opponents the longest same season in the street in program history late in the shot clock thank you brought it up Laramie the wolf pack 14 at one at home this season only lost no they beat Miami here as a matter of fact they beat Miami and opens a pit they lost they lost when you go back and look at the record that was an early December it was when they lost to Pittsburgh that was December 2nd 6860 and this team is playing with tremendous confidence especially here in front of the crowd that has supported them extremely well all season long thats a tough shot from Burns well defended by Carr giving up a few pounds about Wake Forest two of 12 on threepoint shots in the second half you can make it two with 13 but without making threes its going to be difficult for Wake Forest to win the game we have to also mention Demar Monsanto win out at the end of their first half so the leading threepoint shooter as far as per game makes unavailable for the Demon Deacons here in this second half and that changes things drastically for them on the offensive end before 13 points now for Smith after that jumper a win tonight for NC State would be 22 wins the most in the regular season since 1988 for this pack program did an opportunity to look around the ACC Virginia going down by a significant margin 15point loss for the hose at Conte Forum Boston College led the entire game Clemson getting back to its offensive ways scoring 91 points and of course they will come into PNC on Saturday for a showdown between the fourth and 15th into ACC right there top four seeds at the ACC tournament get the double by dont have to play till day three in Greensboro that is called 13 points wherever you mentioned that of course Clemson and NC State in the mix another team that you have to think of starting to get healthy the Duke Blue Devils are looking really good at the lake theyve run off a couple wins back to back getting their full complemented players in the mix Blue Devils at one point Pierce Joyner and then he runs into Appleby it appeared to be an inadvertent Collision but Appleby does need some attention well Appleby was dealing with that calf earlier after attacking the basket and UC Joyner is Applebee grabs the calf and his joint is just running back to two Collide inadvertently as you mentioned but Appleby was already dealing with that calf issue hopefully its just a cramp joiners up to 29 Points now to match his output on Sunday against North Carolina and theyre checking on Tyree Appleby 58 points in the last two games good to see Appleby up and moving around of course you got to mention Tyree Appleby leads to ACC in minutes per game this guy has played a lot of minutes over 36 minutes per game already without Monsanto in this second half 38 minutes tonight for Appleby who is going to that Wake Forest bench foreign NC State honored the national championship team from 1983 many of the members of that team honored at halftime these Dave has honored that Championship with its effort tonight against Wake Forest and thats Williamson Five Points Williamson 40th anniversary of that National Title youre getting old wormy that means youre getting old too my friend remember that game girl for a big birthday happy birthday in advance hows that thank you sir I appreciate it were into the final minute of play for Corey talked about NC State how strong it has been at home 141 71 in conference play this will be their 22nd win of the season last year they were talking about the tournament right before last year they lost it so it was a quick exit five teams the NCAA tournament field two to the final four and amazing the fact that you talk about that moving to Clemson last year that was on a Tuesday these two teams now looking to see if they can play on Thursday thats a big difference in fortunes for both the wolf pack and the Tigers this year big game coming up on Saturday here at PNC and you can imagine the crowd here will be rocking understanding the importance of that game Applause winners of seven of their last nine games is it going your way tonight off the backboard and in Applause Applause Breon pass with the punctuation on this one Ross knocks it out of bounds and thats it 90 74 Lowell back over the Deeks strong effort by the wolf pack in this game jaquel Joyner once again another 29 Point effort three for seven from Beyond The Arc he did it all for the pack what a night for NC State 97
