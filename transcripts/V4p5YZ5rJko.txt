35 points Lin kid going up against Mason grants and we are underway with camels the camels collecting the ball to have you with us here on a fun night for some basketball mat therell be an obvious size disadvantage for the camels but athletic very skilled Here Comes Del Oro trying to back down on Couture and an early turnover thats a nice matchup right there Couture is one of the better defensive players on the perimeter in the ACC and Del Oro was going to take him oneonone on the first possession already a turnover for Campbell and something that head coach Kevin mcgean wants his team to avoid thats what got them in the hole against ECU in that tough loss 12 turnovers in the first half led to that big deficit and they never quite dug their way out then kid trying to drive instead a handoff and Couture misses the three and rebound from Music Grant here is deloro the Big South player freshman of the year last year Campbell now in the Music CAA anding to lob it inside and picked Away by padulla so another turnover probing in to LY kid a kid with a left hand no good boy Steris pulls it down kids off to a really good start this season and he should have an advantage each time down in the post think that three turnovers already for Campbell Mulla look at Lyn kid off the glass thats what he has learned to take his time youve got the ball that deep youre at a real Advantage he took his time and really made a nice play right there the big man that Mike young has been impressed with so far this year kid back toback double figure performances in the first two games of the season for the hokes Campbell runs a hybrid Princeton offense it its really tough to defend so far the hokes have been up to the task Virginia native Baron pulls down the Music rebound Campbell switches a lot plays mostly manto man they press a little bit round the Arc to MJ Collins misses the mark deloro tasos Music Cook young man from Lithuania driving inside off the double team and draws a foul thatll go on Baron boy stas undersized Postman out of Lithuania but hes a senior he really understands how to play plays really hard makes up for his lack of height by his strength and how hard he plays theres Kevin mcgean in his 11th season as the head coach of Campbell spent some time at Richmond with Chris money as an assistant coach first points of the night for the camels he done a really good job got beat in a heartbreaker in the championship game a year ago had a big lead late just trying to make make that next hop for Campbell to the NCAA tournament Campbell has been a threetime big South tournament runner up and mcks tenure Campbell did what they wanted right there took about 10 seconds off the clock theres MJ Collins with a spin the floor for cook pickpocketed by Collins pookies with momento land kid with a tomahawk and Tech takes the lead right back great defense by MJ Collins and a wonderful pass he didnt give it to kid too early gave it to him where he could just take two steps and finish at The Rim rookies forcing a good amount of turnovers early adding that defensive pressure for Campbell Grant trying to work on Baron once again another steal for MJ Collins drives on all the way to the glass Collins is such a strong its just a solid Defender if he can start contributing a little more on the offensive end he could really be a big factor for the hokes certainly producing on the defensive end five turnovers so far for Campbell deloro still no good OK with numbers Couture arxs of a three at four on three and found the open guy thats Mike Young basketball in transition rookies 0 for two from Beyond The Arc so far they got hot there in the second half in three Land once again another turnover this time its a steal from Lind kid Fula thought about it instead going to hand it off to Lyn its the paint touch and draws the foul so 62 Hoke leading early trying to capitalize on some turnovers look at this big dunk from ly kid out a bucket early by Music four Tech leading early in this one 6 to2 at the First Media probably noticed Campbell has a lot of international players on its roster for more on that we go over to Nells Williams Nells thanks Bailey yeah youre right one of the most important aspects of this Campbell camels team is the amount of international players they have on this team as well as the impact theyve had since theyve been in the program since 200000 all years except for one Campbell has had at least one international player on their program and in fact this year they have seven different players from five different countries which is Lithuania turkey Australia England and Russia now head coach Kevin McGee and I spoke to him before the game and he says the team does everything possible to acclimate the players to the United States and to the new country for them and ask them things such as how their culture interacts with them what sort of holidays does they celebrate what sort of food do they eat and coach has said that the team itself has fostered really a mini culture within the program because the team has had an international player since 2000 like I said except for one year for 2014 and 15 now through the structure and the culture of the foreign players whove come through Campbell before the new international players really buying to everything not just about the team but to the school itself as a whole and Coach mcgean hopes that its something that continues to be a presence in his program in the future guys thank you Nells got seven International Players I mean that is that is a lot Ive had two or three on some different teams but uh seven is a lot and thats thats really interesting they said they have really enjoyed you know sharing and making each other aware of the different cultures both ours and theirs right elel potit checking in for Virginia Tech after Lyn kid knocks down a couple of free throws six early turnovers has led to this deficit Campbells got to take better care of the basketball coach for for Coach mck still no made shots from the field for Campbell long rebound pulled down by Couture only two points where free throws knocked down by vo Steris lost the ball theres kotov one of those International Players we just talked about from Russia here is Mike young That season as a Virginia Tech head coach and an ACC Champion back in 2022 local product by near by Radford just had a great career at Watford and now at Virginia Music Tech kick ball you know we talked to Coach young a few days ago right after that loss to USC definitely wasnt discouraged he says were at a decent place right now for where we are in the season you remember that South Carolina game is only the second game of the year and trying to work in a few of these new players like one of them on the floor right now and maai long yeah some some R return ease but a lot of key members of this team are new guys that are learning the offense and defense the way coach young wants them to play yeah one of those new guys out tonight with a sickness Tyler niichel is not on the floor tonight for Virginia Tech what a lob inside to PO again with a size Advantage big body Postman seems like hes fully healthy Bailey and if he is Virginia Tech will get a lot of mileage out of Elijah sonani off of the bench Junior from Wisconsin with a kick out up top that defense for the hokes smoke seus lost the ball and a dive from padulla not to be impressed so far with a Virginia Tech defensive pressure early on to be up 102 midrange its going to stay on this side for Virginia Tech big difference between Friday night and Charlotte and tonight here in blackburg on the defensive him for Virginia Tech lot more energy and focus and and again they played hard against South Carolina but just seemed like a touch late all the Music time locating the shooters especially early against South Carolina played really well in the second half on both ends of the floor now the hes did outscore South Carolina there in the second half but still fell by two trailed by as much as a double digit deficit to the game box speaking of double digit deficits theres one right there 122 on the drive from Sha padulla averaging almost 21 points a game of course helped by that big career ey 26 against the game CS loose ball at Music midcourt Campbell trying to share the ball swinging into the corner Dugan knocks it down first shot from the field hit so far today for the camels and its Dugan the freshman from Massachusetts player that coach McAn is really high on yeah came in physically ready to play can really shoot the basketball you saw it right there on that position sha padulla faked at him should have stayed closer to it CR over on the three no good offensive Applause Music board J Collins wants some help with the screen and a pull up a midrange J theres those shots has been vacing in practice but not necessarily converting in the game if he does that again gives them another offensive threat around the arc Dugan again this time its an air ballus pressured outside they go to dug and again this time almost lost the ball swatted back in a short shot clock now at 41 number five Kai long a player that Mike young really wants to get going trying to find his W Rhythm into this offense you saw some athletic plays he made there against the Gamecock at the Spectrum Center was really a stand out at ODU down in Norfolk got a rush here for deloro its a shot clock violation so a tough defensive stand for Virginia tackle again but just really s on the defensive end very few open looks theyve been doing a good job on the ball screens either switching or really hard hedging and making the ball handler give the ball Music up freshman Jaden young getting some burn here early really like him he can really stroke the basketball again physically ready to play played in a really good program and in Country Day Out Of Greensboro heres Collins Elijah Music Walsh lorso still with no points so far here started out with just one shot Applause Music attempted kov working on potit long trying to reach a hand in there and slaps the ball Applause away possession arrow will keep the ball with Campbell down to seven on the shot clock off time brings us to another break 14 to5 Virginia Tech up by nine early in this one points off of turnovers Hokies only have 14 from the field tech shooting six of 14 at this moment have not knocked down a triple yet still looking good here defensively deloro has been quiet and the first 8 and 12 minutes that was almost a walk and had to force up a shot talking about the defense again yet I think it was a walk nine turnovers in nine minutes Reiner re Steiner coming in the Freshman from Georgia played really well in first game out it was hard to take Shawn badulla out of the game at South Carolina he was playing so well especially in the second half where you mentioned he had 22 Rex Steiner only played 90 seconds against the game comes Couture and thats something that coach Mike young really wants to change hes like I dont want sha padulla and Hunter Couture to have to play almost the full 40 minutes of every game so its going to be crucial for guys like Rex Steiner as well as Jadon young to get some reps here especially on the early going yeah well talk about those minutes played later in the game too but but that comes with trust and and that trust only is developed over the course of time kid able to track it down in the back court there you see who has to be on the floor the two most trustworthy guys at this point in their development good on the layups and an pulls it Music down coming in Mason Grant with an athletic move cant finish this is too close shot Grant the best athlete on this team out of North Charleston South Carolina kick it back out for Collins Kai long one of the n one there kind long averaged almost a double double for Jeff Jones and Old Dominion last year and you know I think hes capable of doing those kind of num hes just so active not not really explosive but hes always around the basketball six points in each of the first two games for the hokes had a solid game against Tech down in Charleston last year in that Invitational Tournament when monarchs took on Virginia Tech and made that a really close game long at his third school started out of Rhode Island then went to ODU now at Virginia Tech for the Maryland native Music also back in for the hes 31 Robbie Baron and another transfer Robbie Baron been his entire career at Northwestern up to this point of the Collegiate School in Richmond Virginia about to say were going to talk about that you your daughter went to collegate youre here youre just a walking advertisement for what are the the Cougars down in Richmond thats right thats right all right thats right and Russell Wilson had a good game there we go another Collegiate graduate fin only got him a win yeah yeah Rex Music Steiner Campbell with a solid defensive possession themselves but in and out look at Lyn kid hell go to the line for a couple Oki starting out ice cold from Beyond The Arc now 0 for six yeah not shooting the ball well but points off turnovers inevitably are high percentage looks in transition and then some Second Chance points like is coming up right here for Mr kid only one shot made from the field so far for Campbell thats the three from The Freshman Dugan Lin kid already with seven points number 30 Anthony delosa 35 Alex K kid a guy that Virginia Tech fans excited to watch this year you can see him come into a little bit of a Zone in games last year for Virginia Tech looks like hes got an even bigger role here in the 2324 campaign yeah if he and poti could split that position and play good 20 minutes a piece and uh stay fresh all the time I think that would be that would bode well for Mike Youngs group back to her out in the slam theres the Princeton offense Elijah Walsh sophomore from England put some more points on the board for the camels but a great feed from cotop a little bit of life for Campbell on the shot clock once again going down to Lyn kid look at Lin kid the physical presence and the finish with the left hand last year would have rushed that a little bit maybe walked or maybe not gotten the shot up but he really playing with a lot more confidence tasos cook looking down in the shot clock again cook might have to rush a shot here for Mason Grant lost the the ball and another air ball goes back to Virginia teack nice job by Baron that time playing a smaller quicker really athletic guy stay between him and the basket and I think he even got a piece of Applause that back with the hokes up 12 looks like Shan padulla ready to check back in Rex Steiner to the bench MJ Collins coming in for the freshman and Jaden Young okis back for a swing of a couple of nonconference home games got wford coming up on Sunday Mike Youngs old stomping grounds Terriers coming up to blackburg Terriers gave the balls all they could handle the other night in Knoxville heres Music Applause Couture Walsh carrying in still loose stays with Campbell brings us to yet another break okis up 12 enjoying a double digit lead at the castle over the camels Music hoky up 12 as you get a beautiful look over torguson bridge on the campus here at blackburg Virginia well ly kidm look at him so far this year shooting around 85 hes already got 10 points tonight and look at last year he just averaged five points per game almost triple what he averaged hes averaging 8 and 1 half rebounds a game and thats really in limit to minutes and he did it Bailey with hard work in the weight room with David Jackson in the film room with the staff and on the court with the coaches hookies have dialed up that defensive pressure forcing the turnovers thats been the story of the game so far for Campbell nine of them so far just two shots made from the field one of them a dunk and the Finish there from Elijah Walsh shes got two of the buckets for the camels got direct pass to the post set that up good execution out of the timeout by Campbell Dueler coming off of a 26point Music performances got two points for the hokes on the layup D works it out to Couture still cold from three started out 0 for seven M Baron had set a nice fade screen got him open Del Oro is having a quiet first half so far tring to get the tip back and Lyn kid is there to collect Music it whos done a really nice job on Delo coming off that big game at East Carolina theres sha padulla trying to get it going from downtown good job by Dugan contesting that shot Al help the hand off swatted Away by Couture it stays with Applause Campbell Che number zero Mo checking in MO another Lithuanian averaging double figure now in your coaching trips did you make it out to Lithuania I did not had several players play there but uh made it to Russia made it to Germany made it a few places oh good Lyn kid able to pull it down and imagine those home visits are got to be pretty interesting if youre able to make one out in in Eastern Europe I mean what do you talk about youre like oh yeah youre from Moscow Im from Woodstock Virginia yeah we dont we never know what The Interpreter might be saying but we had successful trips we had one German player we had uh four Russian players so so The Interpreter must have been saying something good about this there you go I got to learn up learn how to say Chattanooga in in Russian me its that that just translates directly its a flop and go off the russan for Campbell comes up with a Applause Music SWAT back to her cut again and another turnover well Campbell trying to make some adjustments Elijah Walsh youre seeing a little bit of energy from them what NS Williams yeah guys I was behind the Campbell bench coach was talking especially to cook and Walsh about just getting space and focus on the weak side guys as well as going downhill hes really not happy with how long those offensive possessions have been and he really wants to emphasize getting the ball to those guys and when they when it comes the shooters will shoot and the shots will fall guys see if this shot Falls for Virginia Tech still no and penetration a post pass and a kick out usually that leads to a high percentage look probably Baron couldnt knock it down that time yeah Baron was watch wide open but yet again another turnover 1 Oro coming off of a career night its ECU so far has started out in this one 0 for three from the field with three turnovers got to remember that deloro even though he was the big South freshman of the year last year its an adjustment now because as Kevin mcgean said hes now the top player on the stat sheet or on The Scouting Report and last year there was about three or four on that sheet for opposing teams to scout them yeah and Couture Collins and padulla have done a good job of frustrating rattles out long drought for the hokes uncharacteristically for Virginia Tech Hunter Couture a guy whos in the top every year of threepoint percentage in the ACC right now Virginia Tech has missed its first 10 threepointers yeah and Campbells had a little bit to do with that although theyve had some pretty good looks that just didnt go down Campbell gaining confidence though hanging around despite the fact that theyre really struggling on the offensive end deloro likely going to have to be the guy to change that and he chucked that ball behind the backboard its going to be a foul on Virginia Tech Sean created the contact right there and is going to get to go to the free throw line see if he snaps his scoreless streak Music Applause hereon well almost a 90 free throw shooter on the year struggles here in the first half sophomore from Melbourne Australia you can see the frustration in his body language has his points now or just his point I should say inside of single digits though 1910 to get through the trap at midcourt again down under 20 seconds when Virginia Tech starts their offense actually at Music 16 7 seconds on the shot clock potit was wide open nice job by Collins kept the dribble alive until two came to get him and he found potit under the rim the big men have shined so far for Virginia Tech with linen and now potit going two for two from the field hard bouncing Shan padulla thought he had all ball there you can see the frustration for the junior guard thats his second foul takes us to another pause here hokey still up double digits 2110 well we started out the show highlighting sha padulla and Anthony deloro been a bit of a slow night for the two star guard so far yeah you know what happens Bailey is the coaches spent all their time showing them film of how good Del Oro was and how good padulla was last time out and the and everybody gets excited they really take that seriously and they have done a really good job defensively but its my analysis right here is that we got two good offensive teams and were going to see that in the second half gotcha yeah so far for Virginia Tech the offense has been better than Campbell because of that defense for Virginia Tech turning the ball over so many times that was 11 turnovers for the camels so far you know I dont Im not is sure its been better they theyve scored a little bit because of the turnovers right but really you know five on five its its only the turnovers that has kept Campbell from being right in this game another thing with the iies 0 for 10 from three as Rex Steiner is into the game now sha padulla has two fouls see how the Freshman handles this pressure running the offense Couture with another lob in potit gets hacked tech fans wanted a foul officials call it all ball there I thought that was smart really attacking inside poti with the size Advantage down low not necessarily in height around to Walsh he says why not loose at the top of the key Couture fights the ball back for the hokes Couture does so much even when the shots not going in he still Music contributed comes Rex Steiner Here Comes Couture right to the square still no good and Hunter Couture a bit slow to get Music up a lot of Hoke fans along with Hunter Couture there wincing at pain and seeing the graduate student for the Hoke slow to get up and now foul to Virginia attack on the other end yeah five on four and Campbell did the right thing and attacked and found an opening now they get to go to the free throw line to the line for Campbell 35 lets see if Campbell can shave this lead down to potentially seven points here I I feel like Mack if they go into halftime only down by seven or six that feels like a major win especially with how slow they started this game anywhere in single digits coach mcgean is going to be happy because they just have not really done a a good job of taking care of the basketball they played well enough on the defensive end holding a really good Virginia Tech offensive team to just 21 in the first 18 minutes kot off hits both free throws so now that lead is down to seven at Music 2114 Jaden young now trying to make an impact in this game look at rajal po late in the first half against South Carolina Virginia Tech started doing this started going inside and it really made a difference paid off big in the second half rooki so far with 16 points in the pain most of those coming from Lin kid add six more from Music potit corner three deloro good job by Elijah Walsh hes played really well since coming off the bench Mo seus wow what a pass in the Finish from sonani hes still fighting through the traplin kid ready to check in on the next dead ball see they try get it back inside hter coutur tries again hter and the trout is over Virginia Tech able to hit it first three here in the first half shooter shoot doesnt matter what you did on the last shot make the next oneor checking into the scoring effort for the hokes now back to a double digit Music lead kick ball stays with Campbell checking back here for the hes 15 Here Comes SL Music Ki didnt need much space did he I like what you said here ma that the shooter shoots taking a break pookis up 10 after the threepointer from Music Couture Music experience the joy of gifting at Jared now get preblack Friday access with 20 off storewide oh we knew Mac Virginia Tech was not going to give up on those threepointers theyre a team where thats a really crucial part of their identity especially Hunter Kor and Tech finally hit its first one there one for five of the night so far for Honor yeah and again you Shooters have to have a very short memory they they cant worry about what happened on that last shot yeah they might get on a roll and feel confident but at the same time if youre missing you know youre a good shooter youre going to keep shooting and and Coach young wants him he talked about that on the call this week said hey I want those guys to believe the next ones going Music in Hunter coutur guy Mike young is certainly believed in from day one was originally a commit to wford before coach young took the job at Virginia Tech now in his fifth season with the Hokies honor Couture in his fifth Seas season as Music well bounce out seus just a bit too short followed his shot hand off and the shot clock is off for the hokes to have one final possession before Music halftime see what Virginia Tech can draw up here for one final bucket TR to attack this press down to five see what the Freshman can do here and Rex Steiner hes got to shoot it now almost got it to fall and that is it for the first half a pretty slow offensive one at that at 26 a good crowd on hand always is here in Virginia Tech even for these early noncon matchups Robbie Baron showing some aggression ly kid with a tip back in that was a good play that was an ISO for Baron to take his man off the dribble did a really nice job missed it but kid there for the tip and then the tip Music in theres Mason France cook is getting a good amount of playing time cook for Campbell has Twisted his ankle in the last two games so really trying to work his minutes in there he is now with a triple on the way and he got it gamble for the steel set that up coming out of that coming out of that gamble for the steel it was five on four and they found the open Applause man Shan padulla with a couple of fouls in this one for Virginia Tech just two total points so far right back up to padulla hes got a shooting I dont think that padulla even knew Until the End right there that the shot clock was running down didnt matter anyway hits the impressive midrange and thats how he got started in the second half against South Carolina and Charlotte on Friday night another three on the way Steris with a Applause miss here comes the hokes for NJ Collins around the ark working inside for Collins and the teardrop cant go he can get in there he can get to the rim cook lost the ball boy Steris able to pick it up backing his way in on Lyn kid it two short stick back cant fall Oki once again coming out with major aggression on defense so far the ball handling from padulla that was unconventional lets see that is an and one wow count the basket with the penetration found kid kid went up through the contact had to grab the rim on the way down because of the contact right here you see boy Music stas the bucket second get already above his average on the year 135 has already got 14 here tonight in just 12 minutes of play now W remember he only had five points per game in all of last season ly kid stepping up into a bigger role for the hokes going to have to see how that works out when Virginia Tech starts to get into the heat of this noncon schedule playing the more of the power fives and then the ACC schedule that starts on December 3rd against Louisville and Ls been very good on the defensive end too see what he can do here against kotov made that tough for Applause Music him Sean padulla going up against kotov with a miss deloro dribbles the ball off his foot rolls it back up top masing Grant long Applause Music two see what Mike young dials up follows his set Music play for Hunter Couture likes that three ball and hes hit his last two really nice execution right there back door cut couldnt a little bus screen and then the dribble hand off for the hand off to contour for the wide open three well even coach young said were getting the shots we like theyre just not going down its uncharacteristic for us MJ Collins look at the defense there Rook hes going three on two swing it out for Couture wanted that to go and a bit too short Music padulla against Del Oro and a block pass out on Virginia Tech number three so hoks up by 17 3619 a little bit more offense for Virginia Tech here in the second half so far you saw the pass to the post and a cut to the post and the Coutures man right here has to stop the cut by Baron which leaves Couture wide open to come here now we can see the finish of the Applause Music play wide open three great execution for Mike young now on the defensive end watch the defensive effort oneonone for MJ k watch him stay between his man and the basket not only contest the shot but block the shot and another fast break going the other way for the Hokies Force turnover for Tech Campbell able to get the ball start out here on the under 16 okis up 17 after a big three and now Al call that sends kotov to the line onia number 10and called with a foul thats the third game of the season Virginia Tech starting out with a win against Cen State hoky rattled off an 100o performance Rex Steiner had double digits in that one got to say I think that triple digits might be outside of the realm of possibility in this one M yeah yeah the theres going to have to be a rush of three here Applause second Elijah Walsh coming back in for Campbell and that dunk there in the first half adding a little bit of athleticism for the sophomore from Leeds England played his high school ball in Music Florida that press has shortened the game a little bit Bailey for Campbell Drive to the hoop a kick out inside out to Perfection for the hokes thats so good and that is textbook hokey Basketball Baseline Drive Baseline drift for the threepoint shot really nice play by MJ Collins again the Hokey start knocking down those open shots Virginia Tech can be a really dangerous ball Club sck back in and the n one goes for Elijah Walsh Baseline Drive kick to the corner draws the defense see the defense collapse on Collins Drive that leaves cure wide open in the corner and that is something Mike young practices every single day got to really give it to MJ Collins as well in the face of two Defenders getting off a good pass he Hunter Couture that is his third three of the night so he is four away from tying Malcolm Delaney as the second alltime leading threepoint shooter in Virginia Tech History MIT Collins he only has four points but hes also got three assists and all of them led to threepoint plays either in the post or the jumper from the long range hes a player that really impressed a lot of Virginia Tech fans is just a freshman coming out of Clover South South Carolina with his toughness last year wore that mask in a game for the hokes to down and official Ted Valentine said thats going to go to Virginia Tech or excuse me to Campbell couple of freshman right there Jaden young and Rex ster not a great communication then the the late pass to Music Applause potit theres deloro tipped in the air and picked Away by Rex Steiner one arm pass heres Jaden young freshman trying to join the three party young out of Goldsburg can really shoot the basketball that was a nice pass by Couture to get him the wide open look going a trap into the corner sonani marks up a three a bit too hard and took down of Applause bounds Here Comes M long M long be interesting to see throughout nonconference look at a guy like maai long as well as Robbie Baron who also is running off for Virginia Tech how did these guys start factoring into the offense cuz maai long especially thats a guy who averaged a double double as deloro hits his first three of the night averaged a double double nearly at OD you yeah theyre both capable theyre both still learning their role with this team and the and the timing and execution of this offense swatted away Lin kid fell asleep for a second there deloro with a feet to cotop and he skies in the hoop really nice play by Delo getting that ball keeping the head up saw his teammate running down the floor and rewarded him a press the Freshman point guard he gets it across the Music timeline Jade young out to long and that is a charge Mike young did not like that call but instead it is a turnover that sends the ball back to the camels Elijah Walsh has been a factor in both halves watch him move his feet right here got in stayed in legal guarding position long a little bit with that left arm and I think that led to the charge rather than the blocking Music call Campbell with some life see what they can do with this possession here deloro could be a factor here on the offense in the second half the Campbells do have a chance and to spin past Couture misses the midrange so the Hoke hes went penalized for the charging call heres Jaden young way too hard ly kid right there hand off to kid and hes fouled really unselfish play shot Fay kick it to the post post kicks it to the other Music post and kid back to the free throw line Campbell 35 for five on the night thats his first 13 foul to the line kov looks like he wants his sub ster is going to come in for Music Campbell too short on the free throw for lin k o yeah not for the faint of heart inside here tonight Bailey stes comes in and kotov has got a lot of minutes tonight hes been a factor hes had a couple nice passes to back door Cuts kid gets the roll up to a 13point lead for the Music hokes lorso lost the ball its loose and at midcourt zacho able to go back to Campbell that brings us to a break nothing nothing makes a coach happier and Coach Med is very happy with this play right here Knox lose uses the body to get the ball finds his teammate for the finish here in the second half and well weve already mentioned that Campbell has seven International Players but the Hokies went outside of the United States trying to make their little International influence on their team as well for more on that we go over to Nells Williams Nells yeah thats right Bailey back in August virgin Tech took a trip across the pond to Europe where they visited Italy as well as Switzerland some of the stops along the way included Lake comoo Milan as well as Lugano loan and Geneva they also competed in two games against Italian teams going 2 and 0 now the trip was important to the team not only to make memories but for the new transfers such as Tyler nickel Robbie Baron and McKai long to get to know and get closer to the current players and Coach Mike Young when I spoke to him about the trip said it was invaluable because of the amount of Rost return over year by year and it was phenomenal overall and when I asked about whether or not he picked up any Italian while abroad coach said no hes still trying to master English guys thanks NS yeah can you imagine just trying to get that many people at the airport early enough for an international flight I mean Mike young has to go full dad mode on that one right Mac I mean youve done the international trip yeah and and theres so valuable and and not only are they valuable culturally but theyre also valuable as a basketball teaching tool Music also up by 13 a little bit more heat from outside the ark Hunter coutur was open for a couple hes got all three of the Hokey threes tonight even though hes only three for eight under his percentage oh good on the drive from maai Long take it back out for sonani dug and the Freshman back in for the camels as well had a watch out for him outside in the wing but instead boy Steris will go to the line for two Yeah Boy Steris you got to sit on that left hand hes really good going with that left hand and hes so strong he can bump you out of the way is for Steris colloquially known as LV on this Campbell Campbells team first one coach Kevin mcgean just said that boyis is just the best locker room guy got to Campbell and had to learn the culture learn English and now hes just one of the know best guys in the locker room if not the best as far as the culture fit for the camels he good on the floor too he really plays hard every every single possession on both ends undersized every single night but he Music battles see who the hokeys go to without Hunter Couture on the floor Jane young steps inside its too Music hard STS running the point now picks the ball back up the boy STS moving the basketball from the high post out of that Princeton offense Elijah walls to the hoop and a charge nailing The Hokey out there Shan padulla again forcing a turnover that time by taking the charge for the number over the course of his career 52 games play just around four points per game but boy Steris he came into a tough spot last year into an injury and he started to have to play get a lot more minutes for the camels than he thought and you know they were just very close to getting to the NCA tournament with the help of voice Steris for the first time in this programs history since Music 1992 wow a block from Grant you talked about that athleticism of Grant early on in this one showing it off there ma yeah clearly the best athlete on this team hes strong hes really physical and he enjoyed volleyball in that one out of bounds how can sha patula respond here on spin shot clock down to three comes the freshman and young and it will be a shot clock violation so a defensive stand there for Campbell yeah that was a nice move by young but again a really good defensive possession you got to play the entire shot clock against the movement of Virginia Tech youve done a really good job this one certainly not considered a shootout at this point only one player on the entire floor between both teams is in double figures that is LIN kid bo St haris gets blocked by Robbie Baron nice help by Robbie Baron good job by potit cutting the drive off boy ster is not as productive going with the right hand and see help need the help from Bar number zero a good Defender he understands how to play matched up against Grant right here its a little bit of a mismatch both ways all the size for Robbie Baron deloro the Euro stab no good stick back can go for the sophomore from Australia stayed with it hasnt had a good night still playing hard down to a 10point game across the timeline for the hokes once again that Campbell defense slowing them down just a tad yeah takes about 10 12 seconds off every time Lane opened up for sha padulla hell go to the line hes going to throw that down what right thats not something we see about sha padulla very much no not see it in practice occasionally but uh he was going full fledged to the rim line for the h number three Shan poua shoo padulla you saw last year the sophomore looked like he had a lot more responsibility in the offense for Virginia Tech second leading scorer last years team now moving into this year yeah and clearly just had to play too many minutes you know you you we down and to give him credit hes in great shape an outstanding free throw shooter can do everything you want in a big time point guard its the second of two there to make it an 11point lead I know the hogies would like to get a little separation here deloro moving it around to get a shot up no good and MJ Collins crashes down to get the board came a long way to get that rebound lost the ball picked away race to the rim Elijah Walsh somehow finds a way to get the layup I dont know if he got an assist and a basket or not now hes down and Walsh need some help getting up here he got the steal he may be cramped up I mean you hate to speculate on anything but and theres a Timeout on what he did right there but awkward anyway well brings us to a timeout Hokes only up by nine Campbell hanging around here in this second half over the past two years Jersey Mikes fundraiser for feeding America has been a game but double digit so far for Elijah Walsh after that Breakaway play look at this ma yeah got the steal and padulla knocks the ball loose but he stayed with it caught a cramp on his way to double figures the Freshman from England look like hes trying to get back in this game hes in a pretty good mood hes played really well yeah were both very excited that he feels okay because the way that he lay down on the floor whichre just thinking the absolute worst looks like a cramp and now trying to work it down on the sideline before he can rejoin his teammates like we said just a ninepoint game 4132 Virginia Tech is led by as much as 17 Campbell has only turned the ball over two times in the first 12 minutes they cleaned up that just like they did against e Carolina on Sunday in Greenville now remember that was 12 in the first half for Campbell yeah 12 against ECU and 12 here tonight and another three the fourth of the game for Hunter Couture now make that 12 points for Hunter Couture hitting it from PR length there and knocks the lead back up to 12 Music points Hunter has hit all four of Virginia Tex threes in this game heres kot off with a rare three hokis will take that make delor so give up the ball and let kov take a contested three bounce to potit Music Applause with fou brings us to another break 4432 Tech by 12 I have a present for you hi thank you do you want to trade me oh thank you so cute theyre so cute

back into basketball theres kotov what a move wow thats a big time move often Music dribble still hanging around a 12point game if Hunter Couture stays hot from three though that deficit could get bigger MJ Collins this is the bunny but look at the offensive rebound Lin kid tried to punish dorso there says here comes the guard and its good hits the three from the Music corner back to single digits now at nine iby Baron turns around able to hit the shot from the elbow Robbie Baron could be such a big piece of this teams success he really has a lot of skill made it to the NCAA tournament last year with the wild cats a right around eight points a game sha padulla called for the foul though nowll the padulla is for it I think he feels like he got hit with the Music elbow coach off we need to go to the line but look at this second half this happened against ECU now that was a one possession game at the end end of it you see here for the camels in the second half against Virginia Tech seeing start of the start of a similar Trend M yeah and and the same reason both East Carolina and Virginia Tech were outstanding defensively but Campbell Campbell adjusted in that second half already see three triples for the camels you hit 12 shots they in that second half against ECU hit eight so far here in the second half and another free throw goes for kotov and gives Campbell a chance to set that press which takes 10 seconds off the shot clock and the game Music clock Rex Steiner trying to make a statement in this game hoky once again leading by single digits Lin kid weing on kotov whos got nine so far that just feels like a big bucket for L really is a big bucket for Virginia Tech Stop a little run got him a high percentage look otof almost walked and a steal for Hunter Couture Robby Baron for three Music seus delorio Music heres got the offensive Music board swing it out for sinani hes got it huge three and now its an eightpoint Applause game all right Nels Williams is has an update concerning Virginia Tech NS take it away yeah guys I listening on the under paron me injury timeout as the under eight minute timeout Kevin gilon really emphasize whether or not theyre questioning the buyin and have to trust what theyre doing whether not theyre bought into this program and bought into what theyre doing on the court which what coach Mike young emphasized is to continue to move in motion he wanted to trust it and just move the ball really well really clear and also emphasize that they are in good shape as well guys thank you Nells yeah Virginia Tech hitting a big shot there with Robbie Baron thats two midrange jumpers for the transfer getting that back up to a double digit lead but you see the camels with a couple of those threes theyre starting to believe in themselves a little bit more here in the second half this is a big trip to the line for the Soph yeah and hes an outstanding Freo Music shter as you would expect for a guy who went for 32 last time Applause out misses that Applause Music one 415 left Rs trying to sprin away here in the final moments but the camels just not letting him do it Elijah Walsh Mason Grant with that block setting up this possession for the camp Music inside for Steris swinging back out for Elijah Walsh too hard then K defensive board get it oy stas have had some battles down low on both ends of the floor swing it back out for Couture tip pass one onone boy Steris and Lin kid what a night for lin kid hes got 20 now OK spaced that time giving him a lot of room nobody could help he was one onone down there and took advantage Fair night for ly kid so far in this one and a walk Big Break 20 points for lin kid Virginia Tech trying to hang on here up 12 with 310 left over the past two years Jersey not the prettiest night for the hokes mack but Lyn kid you got to respect his career night 20 and 12 in this one yeah and the amazing thing about that not only are a career has but hes done it in 22 minutes you talk about efficiency look at that turn around there 20 points getting Virginia detch back up by 12 7 of 10 from the field coming into this game shooting around 84 from the field so talk about that efficiency its happened in each of the three games so far this season for the Music hokes little post presence makes their offense a lot better thatll be good for the hokes going forward hope hes willing to take a little time now back up by Music 12 Jay Collins with 7 Seconds proven around the ark Collins with a left hand and L kid kid who we talk about during that break that guy ly kid has been the man for Virginia Tech tonight all Music night and the Hoke back up by 14 mois and Campbell going to need to knock down some big shots here not a big sense of urgency right now for the camels heres sonani L kid doing it on both ends good possession defensively for the hokes desan pull whos got four personal fouls steps into his shots got to be a little sense of urgency now for camp Music hard bounc boy Steris swings the ball around for deloro deloro its been a tough night for him yeah that was a tough one Robbie Baron got a those long arms up there and contested that Applause shot coming off of a 35point performance against the Pirates two for2 from the field tonight does have 1 three for for six points shot clock at five l k again l k that was a perfect possession used the entire clock and got a Music dunk and slap away for one minute to play Steris in the prayer of a three but a foul called now on Mason Grant Thatll send Robbie Baron to the line for a one and one Baron has played better than his stats thir so he got the four points and three rebounds but hes been good defensively been a little bit more active and aggressive on the defensive end and the two shots he made in the second half were both big keeping that lead at Double figures both times now remember Campbell did work it down to an point game not that long ago and ly kid really sparked the hokes to go a bit further here to get that lead back up to 16 and now 17 for Robbie Baron off of that free throw still early in the season Virginia Tech going to move to two and one big game against wford this Sunday thats going to be a big challenge for this Virginia Tech team as it still tries to find its identity early in the season wford a really talented really skilled offensive team a lot of young players but got a theyve got a talented lineup course Dwight Perry in his first fulltime season was the inner of last year download him up seus twoo pass thats for Campbell a big season coming up first one in the CAA going to play some new teams College of Charleston being one of those UNC Wilmington both of those teams pick near the top doing a little bit more traveling this year as a squad so really challenging year ahead for Kevin McGee and and this camels roster moving down the shot clock again MJ Collins cant get it to go MK or excuse me maai long cant swpe the ball in deloro cant get the bucket and thatll be it 60 44 not necessarily A Pretty One MA but a win nonetheless for the hokes yeah and a big step forward defensively especially in the first half and and hung in there on the offensive end but theyve got to be
