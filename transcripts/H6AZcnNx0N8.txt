400 at Florida State for Tony Bennett four wins away from Ty and Terry Holland for all time at the University of Virginia the numbers all around very impressive and we are set for basketball the Seminoles in their garnet and gold and the hoons had the basketball first in the white Kihei Clark at the point and indeed Reese Beekman is out there this is quite a 12 backcourt assuming Beekman is healthy to go it really is a UC kieh clock starting with the basketball in his hands and again thats not something weve seen often we see Reese get a good look early unable to knock it down but its just an encouraging sign for the whos that Rhys Beekman is on the floor well both of them are in the top five and assists per game in the ACC they share the duties perfectly and it really has Blended well this season Kaden Shedrick little strong and for Florida State pretty good starting five Caleb Mills the Houston transfer one of the leading scorers theyve got good balance on this end Corey they dont start a traditional point guard though thats the difference with this Florida State team Mills denies ball comes to Darren Green Jr off the front rim Kihei Clark has it for Virginia lets see if theres bounce for Beekman he is fouled and coming away limping is nahim McLeod after the block shot three speak ing to this where hes so dangerous he puts so much pressure on the other team on the floor but the break got started by Kaden Shedrick coming up with a big block honestly Caden might have just been able to grab that one out of there give me that but he started a fast break with that block uh Shedrick averages 13 blocks a game hes got the first one out of the way for the day top 10 in the ACC ENT as Reese Speakman made the first we talked with Kaden pregame he took a tough hit to end the game at Michigan glad to see him back out there and no concussion no none of that big hit for him taking the elbow from Hunter Dickinson which was of course much talk about over the last few days here especially in Charlottesville well a lot of blood in his mouth during the game but glad to see hes out there and doing all right you have no stitches none of that young man gutting it out here today green splits the double team finds Cleveland on the wing fight for the offensive rebound comes to UVA nice job by Shedrick to secure it and Reese bigman hasnt gotten much practice time over the last three days so the rust could be there a bit three days and during the middle of the season is a very long time not to really get up and down the floor can affect your Rhythm well its been a marvelous start to the season for Virginia undefeated and at this end of the floor we are seeing things that weve not seen in a long time for a Tony Bennett coach Club averaging nearly 77 points per game the highest of his era here in Charlottesville and when you think about this Virginia team they do it differently its not about the threepoint shot its about attacking the basket getting to the freethrow line weve already seen Reese Beekman going downhill making one of two and now Armon Franklin puts it in drive and gets to the freethrow line well the defense is still really good but theyre beating teams by an average of 17 points per game and in the ACC they lead in shooting percentage of 50 at three point percentage at 45 but theyre not a high volume threepoint shooting team they get to the line and make them as much as anybody and as usual they take care of the basketball well when you look at the numbers and you compare to the National Championship team of 2018 2019 you see the points per game is up now still early that is a team that played you know close to 40 games its still early in the season thats 767 could come down but if youre Tony Bennett you love seeing the 50 from the field and the 45 from Beyond three point like that means that youre taking the right shots and thats what coach Bennett wants to see most and while certainly as you say rightly theres a lot of basketball to be played and the numbers might normalize its not like theyve just played the poor Sisters of the the blind they have played a really good nonconference why are you picking on the poor assistance on the Block because Illinois or Michigan my goodness Club has been challenged is what Im trying to say they absolutely have but right now if Im the head coach of the Four Sisters of the blind Im sending you a strongly worded email immediately youre probably not alone a couple of free throws for Darren Green Jr the transfer from UCF last year was AllAmerican Athletic Conference third team and he has been a good pickup for FSU where they struggled a lot shooting the basketball last year he has helped with that this year he really has and you think about this Virginia team this is a team That Couldnt Shoot Straight a year ago and now you look at all the offensive numbers with the exact same starting lineup that they had a season to go Armon Franklin is one of those who is just shooting better this year is up to nearly 40 percent although hes had his moments and as you pointed out this team is attacking the basket well but thats where Armand has really improved not just relying on his jump shooting but getting downhill attacking the basket and going to score not looking for a call but we asked coach Bennett about the Improvement in Franklins numbers his first time after transferring from Indiana a year ago as Gardner comes up with a turnover Jade lost it on the way up strength and hustling there for the basketball what do you think the biggest change is for Franklin this year I believe the familiarity in the system and the fact that he now knows where his shots come from a great find as we tee him up hes able to knock that one down but an offensive rebound Music Shedrick right to the rim and thats I mean Cadence Cedric has improved by five points per game on his average from a season to go from 69 to over 11 points per game in the his plays like that hes just much more confident where his shots are coming from and being more aggressive on the offensive end of the floor well Caden Shedrick epitomizes what Tony Bennett wants out of his players he came in and redshirted then his red shirt freshman year didnt play a lot but last year you started to see it and now hes really blossoming but you see Cedric going toward the basket a year ago that may have been something where he faded away from the contact this time he goes through the contact and is concentrating on finishing in comparison to getting a call he is one of four Virginia starters averaging between 11 and 12 points per game coming into this one 16 30 to go first half the Wahoos up 62 on the Seminoles green with the runner six to four and I believe green has figured it out for the nose he understands his role with this team and that where they need him to score they always need of course for God to be a threepoint threat but hes not just that and hes shown that over the last few games hes at 42 percent on the year a season to go the Seminoles were 221st in the country and threepoint percentage and uh he was brought in to help address that and this is Florida State basketball they want to turn you over theyre going to switch everything and make you feel as though you had a mismatched as Cameron Fletcher attacks the basket no mismatch against Kaden Cedric however Cedric with his second block on the day both emphatic this one leads us to a timeout with the whos holding a six to four lead Music to help protect from HIV I prep without pills with aptitude a

points of the game including the gamewinner to beat the buzzer and Big Time shot from Matthew Cleveland who was last years ACC Sixth Man of the Year but Im sure that had to be his most memorable moment of the Season getting that win on the road Armon Franklin had just made a jump shot to get the game to 6361 in favor of Virginia and this has been a battle between these two programs during the Tony Bennett tenure and this is the one team that Tony Bennett does not have a winning record against in ACC play I believe he may not have a winning record against the Blue Devils also but everyone else he has a winning record Point Blank shot from cam Corin misfires looks like Shaden or Caden Shedrick took a shot to the face again and remember he took that shot against Michigan the other day and playing through some pain right now yeah a little slow coming back down the floor but the thing about Kane Shedrick a year ago was knocked out of a game first North Carolina gets Armando baycott since then even when he takes those hits which youre gonna take is a big he sticks around stays in the game and is fighting through it hes really toughened up as a Young Man during his time here in Charlottesville second UVA turnover and again Reese Beekman playing werent sure until tipoff got a blocking foul what have you seen from Reese Beekman so far Corey I see that hes out there of course hes nowhere near as aggressive as were used to seeing Rhys but the fact that hes out there gives a lot of confidence to his team and we see just Gardner really trying to get to the spot however impeding the progress of Cameron Fletcher trying to get all that sideline Music right in front of Virginia so theyre displeasure our officials this afternoon Doug sermons Ron Gruber Clarence Armstrong five minutes in and here is Cleveland and hes gotten his offense going lately the last couple of games Music nice looking shot in the lane for Jalen Worley and thats the guy that Florida State really needs to get going we mentioned they dont start with a traditional point guard in the lineup but Jalen Wooley comes in early he is the traditional point guard for the nose if they can get him playing a much larger role both offensively and defensively that would help the Seminole instruments van Vander floss into the game here is Beekman second time hes tried from that corner oh for two but what were seeing a lot of is Reese Beekman off the basketball and being a recipient of kieh Clark passes in comparison to what were used to seeing and that being vice versa well Kihei comes into this game at 44 percent on threes Beekman was eight of 14 coming into the year but hes missed his first couple but the numbers really are something Van Der Klaus has played a role in the improval we talked about Franklins Improvement but Vander Falls has been as a rad transfer a huge Edition when you have the ability to bring someone off the bench averaging eight points per game but vanderplas has a tremendous amount of Versatility also he ended the Michigan game guarding Hunter Dickinson after Cadence Cedric fouls out youve got the 6A vanderplas having to go guard to seven foot one Dickinson did a great job on that but he also is effective on the offensive end of the floor being able to bring Biggs out of the painted area in that game last time out the Cavaliers rallied from 11 down at halftime to Beat the Wolverines first shot from Tom house misfires UVA with the basketball tied at six Applause are you going to have me Thomas in the house reference at all during this game I wasnt planning on it okay but you know but now you may I dont think so Ill leave that to you well I gotta go with Tom in the house simply because Tom has has time in Charlottesville he knows a little bit about the area indeed he does Music Applause I believe weve got a stoppage there because of the shot clock Applause Music right now it was at 18 seconds but theyre just checking to see if the shot hit the rim okay it was a live ball turnover thats why the shot clock goes back to 28 seconds because I thought I was thinking you dont reset it to 20 I mean to 30 on a missed shot so but it was actually a turnover Florida state had possession of the basketball during their stress because normally on the offensive rebounding recessed to 20 seconds Music gonna pull up Isaac McNeely know here is warley good size for point guard at 66 Cleveland from the foul line now but you see where thats a play where Matthew Cleveland as he gains confidence will shoot the threepointer in comparison to trying to get closer taking a tougher shot now last two times out he had 17 against Nebraska 20 against Purdue and as you mentioned he was the Sixth Man of the Year a season ago has a very bright future vanderplan Thrive and Dish Franklin spotting out its good Applause Music Applause Music we mentioned Virginia does not rely on the three as much this season but they have one guy who really has to stretch the floor and that is Armand Franklin big game against Baylor 26 points for him and he did a lot of damage from Beyond The Arc and hes going to be the guy that Virginia has to rely on throughout this year to consistently provide production from Beyond that Arc but as you pointed out earlier Corey he was nine for ten from the line against Baylor so not just getting it from Beyond the yard yeah and hes again hes developed into more of an allaround score than he has just a threepoint shooter he relies so much on the three a year ago and now you see hes much more wellrounded as a score with his ability to attack the basket and get to the free throw line Francisco Cafaro has come into the game replacing Kaden Shedrick for Virginia Applause hes got the ball now Applause Caleb Mills dribbles up for FSU heres house nothing but net Tom house finding the range in transition and the young fellow playing with a lot of confidence as of late providing shooting for the Seminoles as theyve tied this up well he lifts his hometown as Dayton Ohio but hes very familiar with Charlottesville because his dad was an assistant coach on the womens team and he knows what its like to be a who now coming in to play for the opposition he absolutely does and he was here right around the time the jpj so well have to say Tom is in the house Music for my triple treat three layers deep

State freshman Tom house should be pretty comfortable since he lived here for a while as a kid his father Jeff was on staff for the UVA women theres Dad on the left Jeff and Ann whos a long time volleyball coach head coach at UMass lowland at Virginia in town watching their son take on the hoos absolutely and sitting right in front of the house family is Florida State Legend Peewee Barber also Harrisonburg High School a few years right after Ralph Sampson who was the star of Harrisonburg High School so Peewee coming to check out his alma mater as Tom is in the house as well as Jeff and Ann making the trip back to Charlottesville where he once roamed the sidelines alongside Debby Ryan and you know along dads long 34year path as a basketball assistant coach at all levels for both mens and womens he worked for both Van Gundy Brothers when he was still in college he worked for Jeff Van Gundy at McQuaid Jesuit High School in Rochester and then his brother Stan Van Gundy took Tom on as an assistant at UMass Lowell so he may be able to tell us which of the band Gunnies was actually a better basketball player Im sure he could but would he tell us I mean I wouldnt know well I wouldnt tell because you dont want to get the other one mad at you I mean again see thats whats wrong with the world today not concerned about people getting mad at them who cares if people get mad get over it its Corey Alexander cory No E no e thank you Music Florida state with a basketball trailing by two nahim McLeod all seven foot four of him goes to the left hand but McLeod really doesnt give Florida State much production on the interior as far as they score so if youre Virginia you want to stay home Corner three well short from Chandler Jackson and Rhys Beekman starting today and still out there but you can tell Reese Beekman does not have the same level of explosion that he normally plays with hasnt been as aggressive attacking the basket got to the Rim Early he got to the freethrow line but hasnt been quite that same guy Santa Claus Franklin with five to shoot steps back fires the three and doesnt quite get the role rebound picked Away by Cameron Fletcher the Kentucky transfer wide open Mills and the Seminoles stay cold from the perimeter Applause Mills down the lane lost it thats another takeaway for Reese Beekman Franklin to the reverse now Cafaro got a hand on it but its Florida state with a basketball right now neither of these teams able to hit any type of separation Music not a high scoring game early and again thats a area where Florida State struggles is from Beyond the threepoint Arc outside of green and house they dont have guys that are really stepping up making many threes and thats been a staple of what Leonard Hamilton has been able to bring to Tallahassee over the past few seasons they can attack the basket theyve got a number of guys that can make shots McNeely know neither team distinguishing itself Virginia now three of 14 from the floor FSU is three of 15 although you had their game against Purdue the other night you felt like perhaps the Seminoles took a step forward in that game despite losing I believe they did and when you consider the fact that theyre playing against you know a top five team as they are here today Purdue went into the tough the fifth in the country uh oh I think Thomas comfortable I do believe Tom house is comfortable in this building and if you go back I believe the tenure his dad was coaching it was jpj we had Virginia had moved from University Hall to jpj in 2006 I believe so maybe Tom got some shots up here as a kid and you know what when the Seminoles flew in from Tallahassee last night they went and had a shoot around the practice facility which also I believe was here it was and from what I understand Tom were shooting the lights out last night feeling very much at home well he is feeling at home here so far this afternoon and its gained him extra minutes with Leonard Hamilton knocking down his second three in transition and Tom house feeling good about things here in Charlottesville meanwhile the whos have missed their last seven shots from the floor house sits down with his six points to give Florida State its first lead of the afternoon and one of the reasons why playing against Florida state has been so challenging for Virginia is because Florida State switches everything especially on the perimeter so what they do is they put pressure on your guards to be able to go make individual plays and without Reese Beekman being 100 healthy he is that guy who does it for Virginia on that screen and roll it was set up beautifully for McLeod to have an easy stuff he just couldnt handle the pass Applause foreign Fletcher Im out here at jpj good one so far

but Virginia was undaunted coming back for the win Jane Gardner with the goahead bucket and then Gardner and Reese Beekman team up Music to stop jet Howard at the buzzer Virginia coming away with another huge win and this has been a honestly when you look at the preseason games the nonconference games for Virginia already three key wins when you think about taking down both Baylor and Illinois two ranked teams in Las Vegas and then going on the road in the last ever ACC Big Ten Challenge and winning at Michigan down 11 at half in the first time since 2019 that the Whos have been able to overcome a doubledigit deficit and win a game well last year Virginia was Owen 17 when they trailed at the half this year 30 so theyre in a good spot right now trailing in the first half to Florida State perhaps amazing that Virginia trailed 17 times at the half a year ago and even more amazing that they never came back to win any of those games wound up going to the NIT which around here under Tony Bennett is not good enough national champions in 2019 and regularly going to the NCAA tournament heres Gardner boys got a great presence down the post and a great job recognizing the switch to get Gardner an opportunity against house and we talked about mismatch as youve got to exploit those against the Seminoles and that is absolutely a mismatch no way house has a chance Garden on that block Wahoos back on top 1312 Applause Music Worley lobs it up theres the Finish we were looking for from nahim McLeod and TA Clark losing a shoe out on the perimeter part the reason why Morley was able to get past him and get into the painted area kieses a great defender but its hard to slide them puppies when you only have on one shoe and it was Kaden Shedrick who actually steps on the back of kieh shu to take it off and a nice fine from Worley over the top to McLeod to give the nose the lead once again over his five years here Corey how is Kihei Clark better now than he was as a freshman well one hes much better as an offensive player but hes a leader hes much more of a leader on this team but I tell you what he ate Clark it probably has and when I say not he but others as Jaden Gardner picks up the offensive foul and thats going to be number two on Gardner fans here not happy about it more so because the call came relatively late as you see the contact there is contact there Tony Bennett not happy about it either Ill tell you what the longer youre here we got a shot of of course Laurel Bennett in the background but the longer you look at Tony Bennett the more he looks like his dad on the sidelines this is year 14 I believe now for coach Bennett and hes starting to look much more like the real Coach Bennett who is Dick Bennett the one that Bennett vanderplas has named after Applause Music travel pivot foot move down Jalen Worley and that is the fifth turnover committed by Florida State and that happens people parents as they get older Corey I understand that yeah do you tend to look like your parents as you get older because youre getting pretty old now buddy I am looking more and more like Dad every day I think yeah I do believe thats the same case with me especially with the gray hair it happens better than the alternative one you got that right youre doing all right up top arent you yeah Im not Im not bad Im not bad heres Bennett vanderplas whose father was a teammate at Green Bay of Tony playing for Dick Bennett TJ Clark right on cue again shooting about 45 this year and to finish your point or your question thats really where hes improved as a shooter as a threepoint shooter thats probably been the biggest Improvement hes always been a great defender and playmaker as Reese Beekman comes up with a big block how about the fact that hes fourth in the league at two block shots per game its not surprising at all this guy does it all in the defensive end of Florida does a great job with Steals and blocks interesting stat hes the only player outside of Grant Hill to ever have 175 assists 50 Steals and 25 blocks in a season and of course you know my relationship with Grant Hill I actually mentioned that to him sent him that stat earlier today he responded with as Charles Barkley would say who he played for so I I proudly reminded him he is a wahoo oh Grant actually a nugget Grant Hills first ACC game and last ACC game were both losses to the University of Virginia he gave that team he gave me that cant believe he shared that he shared that with me and I told him I said that will be on air please believe it because anytime we talk about the whos beating the Blue Devils Im going to make sure I can mention it well there are a couple of stats from Reese beekmans stat line a year ago that really popped and that was one of them and the other one is that uh Not only was he on the alldefensive team he led the league and Steeles assists and assist a turnover ratio and the only ACC players ever to do that Mugsy Bogues Sydney Lowe Chris corciani and Ty Lawson its a pretty good list thats a great list first off any time that you are mentioned with Mugsy Bogues youre talking about ACC Legends at the point guard position and Reese honestly has a chance to be one of those guys I mean when you think about his ability to distribute the basketball High assist numbers but also defensively what he does makes him a special player Ryan Dunn The Freshman from Long Island New York at the free throw line his big brother is a major league pitcher and he gets the roll the inaugural Basketball Hall of Fame London showcase is tomorrow the aforementioned Hunter Dickinson and the Michigan Wolverines take on Oscar sheboy in number 19 Kentucky our coverage begins at one Eastern six oclock in London on ABC and the ESPN app Music well thats impressive getting to go play in London a college basketball game that was not a thing when you were playing right you guys never went overseas or took trips in the in the summertime no I Im not outside of like midseason tournaments in the Caribbean and different places like that Im not really sure that I can remember any college basketball game taking place outside of the United States well your time the season didnt begin until the last week in November with the hall the Hall of Fame tip off in Springfield and the Great Alaska shootout you know all of these events that we have now in November which are great just didnt exist 30 years ago 25 years ago agreed and you keep saying your time like you keep calling me old and I tried to ignore it the first time and you said it the second time but I mean do you remember games regular season games being played in foreign countries no yeah I mean going to Europe I dont remember that ever happened thats impressive foul on done on the perimeter with only three seconds on the shot clock that is his first and the sixth against Virginia and Dunn getting extended minutes here with Jayden Gardner with two fouls here in the first half most likely will miss the remainder of this half but Ryan Dunn has had some moments here as a first year for the University of Virginia has stepped up his production big time Shedrick commits the foul thats the seventh on Virginia and so well have a one and one and this is a team that does not foul often so when you think about Virginia the seven fouls right now being in the bonus for Florida state is a benefit this early in the game is Tony Bennett trying to figure out why it is that his guys are fouling so much thank you well this is the 21st annual womens Jimmy B classic tomorrow on ESPN2 number nine Virginia Tech takes on Tennessee and Knoxville at one Eastern noon Central and then on ABC its number seven Notre Dame hosting number three youth out of the joy center to donate to the V foundation for cancer research go to vorg most of the people here listening to us today would be I would say discouraged was the lightest word to hear me talk about Virginia Tech however my big brother slash cousin Kenny Brooks in the Virginia Tech womens hokey team is Kia Clark misses the easy layup Virginia Tech women off to a great start this season playing in that Virginia B classic coach Mox and the Virginia women playing great early oh Franklin goes down hard and gets the offensive foul to boot Applause but what a sequence starting with the blocked shot by Ryan Dunn and Franklins still slow to get up well Ryan Dunn coming up with the big block on the defensive end for the whos and it leads Virginia into the fast break Im on Franklin getting out the contact a ugly fall and the call does not go his way Music the gift of shine to your person youre one youre everything introducing the youre the one collection exclusively at sales the diamond store

longer Music because your lives Music are forever entwined Music its exclusive Kev Fox and coach in studio coming up at the half well show you how the orange squeeze Dell to win in South Bend Plus talk about the key to number one Houston its gonna be all right lets be positive about this first yeah a lot of rebounding opportunities in this game I was tremendous rebounding opportunities that both teams combined 10 of 44 from the field so they need Corey Alexander out there to make some shots I dont care when you get into League Play I dont care what your record is it is a little bit different you cant simulate that Florida State switch in their land they have sped up Virginia made them a oneonone team Doug and Corey back to you thank you guys I appreciate the confidence from my guy fans by the way I cant play defense for Tony Bennett but I can still make shots but you know what when you think back and we talked about teams playing outside the United States you know of course Ive been reminded once I made that comment by so many of my former wahoo Alum that Virginia did play out of the country way back in the year of our lower 1982 yeah and I didnt remember it either obviously December 18th against Utah and two days prior against Houston both those games played in Tokyo at the Iowa Memorial Hall and so then we all remember the game on their way home dont do it dont do it and once they said Im telling you dont do it I do remember them being overseas but youre right it was a it was a rarity youre about to bring up that game that we do not talk about around here there are two games around here we dont talk about Applause green and thats what Darren Green did to Purdue he knocked down three of his first four threes in the first half really changed the game for the Seminoles on the offensive end of the floor and gives them the lead here as we get under two and a half minutes in his first half yeah that was our fifth lead change of this first half Clark out to Vander floss in and out Applause and right now youve got to watch Alpha green hes one of those guys that will really once he finds himself hot hell take advantage of his opportunities you cant give him any room one of the reasons why Reese Beekman is staying very close turned over off the Bounce by Corin theyre sixth whistling a foul off the ball as vanderplas was coming to set a screen it goes against Corin three Camp Cora and corn a little winded on that possession you can tell that was a tired foul and again as a as a freshman youre going to have those opportunities when you start to get tired you make mistakes and thats one of the areas where Leonard Hamilton has done a great job throughout the past you know 20 years of being able to keep fresh guys on the floor but one of the issues for Florida State this year its their six through ten theyre six through ten are young theyre inexperienced and thats normally where Florida state is B Teams especially over this run of the last seven years that theyve had in Tallahassee they dont necessarily beat you one through five in their lineup with their starters its the six through ten that come in and really take over the game Mark along the Baseline its bounced out of bounds yeah thats been illustrated by the fact that Florida state has produced each of the last four ACC six men of the year and oftentimes those six men of the year are freshmen their first year guys you go back can you think Matthew Cleveland last year Scotty Barnes here before Patrick Williams before that so its been something that has been a staple of the program and part of the reason why theyve had so much success as of late and one sending Corin to the free throw line coach Greenberg was talking about its just different once you get to league play and were seeing that between Florida State and Virginia today and thats the familiarity between these two teams we mentioned that you know for as much success as Virginia has had since 2014 the one team thats been there Nemesis has been the Florida State Seminoles Florida States won four of the last five in this matchup including two in this building very few teams come into this into this building and beat Virginia but Florida state has had success with that and a lot of it is because of the way they defend they switch everything and they make you have to make individual plays and Virginias much more so of a ball movement as Tony Bennett mentioned to us a Wii team not a iteam where one guy goes out and makes plays Isaac McNeely over to Beekman shot clock under 10 peekman penetrates kicks it out McNeely for three the hoos are now three of eleven from distance and back within a point brings it back out foreign defense by Virginia and now they can hold for a final shot after the core and miss Applause Music Applause with five seconds to go Beekman puts it up no Shedrick has it hes blocked from behind Clark at the buzzer and just as we were talking about how well Virginia scores the basketball this year weve got ourselves a defensive struggle well when you think about the Florida State Seminoles theyre going to come in theyre going to pressure the basketball theyre going to defend they have been able to do that here even on the road and we talked about Florida State gained some momentum in that loss to Purdue they played from Tom house threes in transition neither starting units shot the ball well Florida state only three of 18 as a group getting better production Off the Bench part of that is Tom house who we just showed you and the hoos are kind of in the same boat theyre offensive issues though I think stem with the fact that Reese Beekman while hes been playing is not himself I agree wholeheartedly because if you look at this Virginia team if you watch them throughout the season lets get offensive foul on nahim McLeod to start this second half if you look at this team for Virginia Reese Beekman is the primary ball handler its been Kihei Clark in this game simply because Rhys Beekman is not 100 but do you see the adjustment for Tony Bennett to start their second half now the ball is back in the hands of Beekman he will become the playmaker and allowing Kihei Clark to become more of a shooter slash score there he goes attacking the basket finding Clark in the corner goaltending you know what when it works like that is that called TV magic is is that what you consider TV magic yes okay and I was wondering does Beekman have the kind of burst to to do what he just did it seems like hes okay well you know thats the thing about Reese I mean again hes deceptively quick hes a big time athlete but all the time he doesnt always play with the same level of speed so his ability to change pace is what allows him to get open another big block by Kane Cedric and a second one for the hoos They Come Away with the basketball and a onepoint lead and right now this is where you want to be in the Titans and thats the difference Rhys Beekman unable to really be in attack mode on that possession because he is playing you know I asked him pregame how he felt and he kind of gave me the shaky hand and I would give him about 50 efficiency right now as far as how his foot feels great post entry Gardner couldnt finish gets his own Miss and lays it in the East Carolina transfer has been doing it for five years and his counting statistics really are something Corey they really are over 2 000 points the division one leader in free throws active leader in free throws as we see green with the nice move and again its one thing to be able to get that shot off for green but its something completely different to be able to do it against Reese Beekman whos probably the best on ball defender in the ACC instead of trying the layup for the defender on his back Clark finds Franklin who buries the three and again Shedrick is on the floor holding his face and another hit to the face for Kaden Cedric we talked about the number of hits hes taken over the past couple of Seasons as officials are going to go over Ron Gruber signaling that were going to go look at this one to see if that is a elbow from nahim McLeod to Kaden Shedrick and oftentimes when youre playing against guys who are seven foot four their elbows just happen to be in that you know I can remember watching Biggs playing against guys like Dikembe Mutombo and UC ah I believe thats going to be at least a flagrant one simply because as he goes to box out you see McCloud turn around and in Clear View puts his elbow right into the face of Kaden Shedrick didnt see exactly where it hit him hopefully for Shadrick it was in the mouth area and not higher even though he still has the cut in his mouth from the Michigan game previously well at the very least itll be the fourth personal foul on nahim McLeod you and I saw Purdue out in Portland then you saw the Boilermakers their last game and I think the same thing whenever you see Zach Edie he is just that much taller than everybody else he cant help but run into somebody with an elbow as you see this is a greater angle for us to be able to look at it and now that is to the throat so that is a different area to get hit as we see Kaden Shedrick holding his throat that is tough but fortunately and again I say that sitting over on this side fortunately as you catch an elbow to the to the throat it may knock the wind out of you it hurts but that is different from being able to get being getting hit in the mouth its going to be a flagrant one Music which I think is the right call on that one Music I do believe flag of one is the right car especially when you consider the fact that McLeod turn is Has Cedric in his vision yes I believe that you know McLeod fortunate that it was just a flagrant one and thats not a flagrant to ejection in this game of course Kaden Shedrick keeps hearing me say fortunate and Im thinking Im sure hes thinking to himself Court theres nothing fortunate about this youre not the one getting hit Music foreign just got the explanation flagrant one and so coach Bennett can pick whoever he wants to shoot free throws and he sends his fifth year from Woodland Hills California Kihei tharken he buries them both and appreciate Ron Gruber coming over of course great crew today Doug sermons Clarence Armstrong on the call with groover but I can appreciate how the officials come over and not only tell us what happened but explain the rules because they know you dont know you think thats why they only come over because of me I would love it if we can get to the point where the NBA has gotten where everybody in the building can hear the explanation and the viewers can hear it directly from them and not through us so are you saying that because you want to do less work is that the reason Im afraid youll mess it up smart smart see Reese beatman still not 100 limping back down the floor gutting it out for his team in this game knowing that this is a big game you start off the ACC and how about Tony Bennett 130 in ACC openers undefeated as a Who Music last years ACC opener needed a Jaden Gardner buzzer beating shot against Pittsburgh here on this floor to keep that record alive for Tony Bennett and the way Florida state is competing here this afternoon we may need some more heroics here for the whos to keep that record intact well Corey how do the Knowles get Matthew Cleveland with the basketball more involved on this end well theyve got to find a way to be able to get him attacking downhill thats his greatest strength is when hes able to get to the bucket a nice fine from Kayla Mills two Cleveland on that possession but thats how Florida state has to score youve got to touch that painted area and then you make a play Mills with a nice move past kieh Clark and then the beautiful fine dropping it off for Matthew Cleveland who has an opportunity for the and one was that a little TV magic the setup and then they follow through it would have been even more if it was Cleveland going downhill but Ill pre Ill take it because I said how do they need to set him up and then Mills sets him up oh see now that would have required me listening to you and thats the part where I lost it right on cue Mills the assistant the first three points of the afternoon for Matthew Cleveland back to a threepoint ball game Beekman off the window nice nice play by Reed Beekman but you going back down the floor you can see him grimacing not 100 percent a beautiful move using the body to get that nice scoop off the glass those are his first two points of the afternoon Corey just over three minutes gone to the second half Virginia up by five Clark the rebound at five foot ten pulls it down gets it up to vanderplas Applause former Ohio Bobcat nice looking move hes a Difference Maker for Virginia his ability to come off the bench and score be versatile make plays is different and Bennett band Applause Reese Beekman backtoback buckets attacking the basket remember this Virginia team gets downhill they live in the paint Reese Beekman with the nice finish off the glass to put Virginia further in front

guy Jason Williford a lot of credit on that Applause can effort Cancun puts it in and now the offense is picked up for both these teams a little bit here in this second half and we see once again Reese Beekman now with the ball in his hands back to being the playmaker after kieh Clark was the was the dominant ball hand in the first half for Virginia here is Beekman the 63 third year from Milwaukee look at you going Wahoo terminology you know about that I tried to assimilate there you go vanderplas who spent five years in Athens Ohio misses the turnaround and of course the story has

of Virginia with Corey Alexander Im Doug Sherman and we were talking about the fact that Tony Bennett who is from Wisconsin has three wisconsinites on his roster including Ben vanderplas from Ripon Wisconsin and their relationship goes back but not quite as far as I thought maybe again Bens dad played college ball with Tony but Tonys only known Ben since he was like an eighth or ninth grader came here to Charlottesville for a camp but they developed the relationship coming through the portal and here he is playing his final year of college basketball in a Virginia uniform but of course Tony has a relationship with Dean the father so therefore its kind of just you know innate relationship when you know the dad then you got a pretty good idea about the young man and that was one of the main reasons why when Bennett put his name into the transfer portal that and the fact that he hit 18 points against Virginia in the law I mean you know in the NCAA tournament we dont like talking about that but um you know that was part of the reasons why Tony Bennett made sure that they were first and he did let us know that he would have to question his own recruiting ability if he didnt get a guy who was named after his father exactly and here is Ben On Cue but it rings out yeah Bens dad was a real good player on an NCAA tournament team 31 32 years ago Dean averaged 10 per game for Green Bay Dean could never get the basketball he had a teammate who scored well over 2 000 points yeah I had to look him up though because Im thinking to myself I know I average more assists per game than Tony Bennett did but he actually averaged 51 over his career to my 47 so you know I was going to hold that against him until it didnt work out in my favor did you point that out to Tony absolutely not heres Matthew Cleveland the sophomore from Atlanta stepping into the three Caleb Mills no and there is vanderplas with the rebound the pace of this game really Florida state has been able to slow Virginia down and its not often that you see Virginia speeding it up but this team has played with a greater offensive pace and Kihei Clark with the beautiful crossover getting to the basket for the easy layup he missed one of those in the first half redeems itself here in the second hes got a gamehigh 11 points and hes also got his name all over the Virginia record books all tapped out to Cleveland thought about it now they work it back inside at the end of this season hopefully Kihei is able to stay healthy nice hands by Van de plas has to get another shot clock violation for the hoos and UC in Charlottesville that may be applauded louder than anything else especially here at jpj shot clock violations are first that is their seventh forced shot clock violation of the year in game number seven and they averaged just about 28 shot clock violations forced per year okay what other school tracks that one other school does one other school I mean here like you said in Charlottesville they are acutely aware of that oh okay I thought you were asking me there was one you were giving me a trivia question you know you like to do that no Ive got a trivia question for you though Franklin well Ive got a math question for you Mr Syracuse all right well get to that in a second so were talking about gee hey Clark now again things are skewed with the coven extra years for the counting numbers so some career numbers are going to be a little bit off but he earlier this year became the fifth UVA player all time with both a thousand points and 500 assists can you name the other four on that list absolutely okay Sean Singletary Harold Dean John trotty Donald hands oh which one did I miss Music I miss more recent more contemporary oh London there you go there you go Donald hand didnt have 500 assists because I know he had a thousand points no Donald hand did tan Singletary parentez and chronic along with keyhand and you did not quite get there okay because were talking about a game right now Im going to rewind that later and go back and think I said that oh nice but Applause hook three thats one of you you have to make it Kihei with the beautiful fake sends

has still been a playmaker attacking the basket finding his teammates will end up as one of the alltime leaders in assists at University of Virginia has gotten off to a great second half start here dropping dimes meanwhile his mom has made the trip from Baton Rouge Julie Jackson and shes not using her assigned seat because Julie says that her nerves are terrible so shes got a great seat closer to the to the floor but shes gotten up walked up top and she cant sit down as though shes sit down now but she will be back up on her feet moving around of course I had opportunity to meet Julie way back in the day when I was recruiting Reese trying to bring him to Oak Hill for a senior year high school he turned me down but still decided to come here which was even more important well he went to scotlandville magnet in Louisiana the family moved when Reese was 13 from Milwaukee to Louisiana I cant believe he didnt say I want to go to Oak Hill and play and learn from the great Corey Alexander Gardner with another layer and Reese with another assist as he continues to limp around but yet showing off his passing ability and I have Reese done unforeseen circumstances came in late but I have reached on it it was a done deal Applause 20 paint points today for Virginia threepoint rolled in by Jalen Worley and against this FSU pressure Virginia has seemed to be in a better flow in the second half after a season low 23 percent in the first half Corey theyre pushing 70 percent shooting here in the second yeah and the pressure has affected Virginia right now already eight turnovers in this game and its a team that only averages close to 10 a game always wanted a better ball handling teams so Florida States plan has worked but Virginias starting to find some Rhythm here in this second half Park had the pass go through his fingertips and into the front row uncharacteristic turnover there from Kihei but I think he was already thinking shot before he caught that one thats what happens when you improve as a shooter he started to hunt those shots now as king cedrics checked back into the game for the first time since taking the elbow to the throw glad to see him back on the floor has Kihei turned down any jump shots that you can remember this year Applause um well Kihei Reese Armand and myself had a long talk and Im guessing when you say we had a talk that means you were talking yes I did the majority of the talking and they did the majority of the listing but I believe that they absorbed what I was saying and I asked the three of them has coach Bennett ever said to you thats a bad shot and I believe that all of them said no uh oh no I believe all of them said no and my challenge to them was make him tell you yeah that was a bad shot meaning stop turning down good looks Applause oh thats a good look for Darren Green and Jalen Worley finding the shooter finding the hot hand and Grains three makes it a sixpoint game hes now got a game high 12 points to lead the seven holes so how long ago did you have that quote conversation with those three and have you seen any of them take what you would say is a bad shot I have not seen them take a bad shot Cleveland punches that into about the 10th row but the conversation happened at practice in October if you have to see them take a bad shot Ive only seen them take good shots but theyre making good shots and theyre staying in good graces with their coach which is probably more important than doing what Im talking to them about you think coach Bennett would appreciate your assistance in that vein I do I honestly do because he wants these guys to be more aggressive when you look at this team this the success of this team will be based upon those three perimeter players Jane Gardner will be their leading scorer of course Kaden Cedric will have a huge role as well as vanderplas but the success of this team will be based upon what they do in the backcourt and for those out there who of course think that Im a

football playoff most likely that goes to Ohio State correct yeah folks in either Columbus or Tuscaloosa are going to be very happy if the Horned Frogs dont win that game Ill tell you what Bennett vandaplace has been great coming off the bench his ability to be the backup for Katie Cedric he can be the backup with Jaden Gardner probably has the ability to come in and play some three as well think about the talent he played with in Ohio hes still in close contact with Jason Preston now the LA Clippers and then Mark Sears the last couple of years transferred out as well hes now at Alabama for the 11th ranked Crimson Tide thats a really good team in the match it was a really good team and you know shout out to Jason Preston who got his first NBA bucket a few days ago saw it on Twitter

McNeely on the floor the difference with this Virginia team from the team we saw last year we talked about the returning starting lineup and all those guys are better but this team has so much more depth and thats really why theyve been different they can go to the bench and bring in guys and give their starters an opportunity to rest but without having any drop off foul on the post entry

whenever you shoot the basketball as well as he does you allow him to space the floor to make creating those driving lanes for Reese big before kie a Clark and band Applause a great transfer coming in fitting right into Tony Bennetts system yeah 68236 and you talked about Ryan Dunn as well one of the freshmen really stepping up also 68 at 208 and roster construction is a fulltime job nowadays with the transfer portal and on the flip side Leonard Hamilton and his staff thought they were going to have a couple of players who came in Jalen Gainey was a huge pickup from Brown University twotime Defensive Player of the Year in the ivy league but hes out with a injury suffered in the preseason and knee injury and theyre still waiting for Baba Miller to become eligible so thats part of the the reason why Florida States off to such a slow start to the year well and that and when you consider and we talk about the transfer portal Leonard Hamilton has told me you know he feels like he dropped the ball on that because he was expecting for a number of guys to be able to return to come back next year specifically Anthony polite Jonathan Butler Malik Osborne youre talking about veterans on that Florida State team a year ago had the chance to come back this year Butler going into the NBA draft polite going into the NBA draft Malik Osborne moving on as well when you think about that if you if you bring back that level of leadership that veteran group to this Florida State team with the young players they came in youre talking about a completely different scenario for the Seminoles right now and Leonard Hamilton you know just feeling like hey if he knew those guys were leaving he would have been much more involved in the transfer portal and coaches as McNeely the twotime West Virginia high school player of the year goes down hard and well head to the free throw line its always been hard for coaches I think to look into the crystal ball and see whos coming back and whos going but its so much harder nowadays and a strong attack by McNeely getting to the rim but landing on that lower back we saw Armon Franklin take a fall similar to that in the first half Applause from Polka West Virginia McNeely makes the first well we have a basketball doubleheader for you Tuesday over on acc Network at 6 Eastern Syracuse coming off the wind today over Notre Dame will take on the Oakland Golden Grizzlies and stick around after that one for the Cavaliers next game a matchup against James Madison here at jpj that one starts at eight oclock Eastern and I will be on the call for that one as well and I can remember vividly going to Harrisonburg Virginia a season ago and watching in the stands of their beautiful new Arena the Dukes taking down the wahos so Im sure theres going to be some retribution on the mind of the whos how far is Harrisonburg from here depends on how fast youre driving my friend oh man Cedric just got hit in the face again 35 Matthew Cleveland I may have to start a petition around here for Kaden Shedrick to start playing in the face mask as he goes up Matthew Cleveland and thats not a dirty play just going for a block finish comes through gets the foul but right now Caden chedwick just playing with a sensitive face after a big hit on Tuesday night and has taken a number of shots to the face may have to start considering the mask cam Fletcher scoreless today had a good rebounding first half but they need more out of him averaging nearly 12 per game we talked about the balance for the whos Florida States had the same Mills green and Fletcher as well as Cleveland all came in averaging over 12 points per game Music we are in the league they really are I mean the familiarity when you get to League Play is he another turnover for the Seminoles on that possession and again at a time where every possession becomes so crucial for Leonard Hamilton and his team you cannot continue to give away opportunities where you have empty offensive possessions knowing that youre going to have to guard Virginia for 20 to 30 seconds on this end of the floor Music Dunn is back on the floor as well as the other true freshman McNeely and back to the fifth year Kihei Clark looking for his own shot and limbers and not only does he does he deliver Ed he takes that shot with nine seconds remaining on the shot clock so 21 seconds of game action evaporated for Kihei to get exactly what he wants and that Virginia Defense is Relentless Florida state has gone four minutes without a bucket and Ive said it before Dougie fresh Im not saying hes the best but Im saying that he is my favorite point guard of all time at the University of Virginia Kihei Clark write it down Ive said it a number of times and he receives entirely too much criticism from the people that are Virginia fans that should be grateful that he stuck around for a fifth year I love what he does I love the way he leads this team and Ive Loved what hes done ever since he walked on grounds here at the University of Virginia well he didnt plan to come back as you know Corey he was expected to go he went through Senior Day ceremonies last year but then about April he had a change of heart and went to coach Bennett and said Id like to come back and and Tony was thrilled to have him back of course and thats what Im talking about with roster construction I mean coach Bennett didnt know he was going to have ba Clark back until April big block by Kaden Cedric once again as Cleveland gathers the loose ball but such a benefit to have a guy like Cedric on that back line who erases so many easy opportunities for the opponent and lets just throw out there again Kihei thak is the only holdover from the national championship team who played on that team Francisco Cafaro was on that team but a red shirt and and Kihei made the most famous pass in program history and it was really the addition of kie a Clark into the lineup alongside Ty Jerome that took that took Virginia two not only the final four but two the national championship simply because Kihei could defend opposing point guards which is often what Ty Jerome struggled with a free tie up and gave him the ability to be a great offensive player and allow Kihei to do the dirty work on the defensive end of the floor this is the 21st annual womens Jimmy B classic tomorrow on ESPN 2 number nine

times in the NCAA tournament before going on to what 15 years in the NBA at least Clark knew Gardner had it for a moment and then lost it out of bounds they say he was the last to touch Florida State basketball and Reese Beekman gonna check back into the game with a noticeable limp but it has to do with the ball handling responsibilities the turnover on the previous possession between McNeely and Kihei Clark in the backcourt Tony Bennett not trusting the 10point lead with two minutes remaining hes seen craziness between these teams before Shedrick called for the reachin oh that is not going to be a popular call here especially in front of Tony Bennett everyone thinking that basketball was deflected off of Mills as you see Cedric hits the basketball off of Mills thats going to be the fourth foul on Shedrick but that was great hands on that possession and so the Houston transfer will shoot a one and one Applause and theres a reason why I mentioned the Houston Cougars another one of the great teams in college basketball going to see them coming up shortly December 17th it all goes down here at jpj and you think about the Houston Cougars number one for the first time since 198283 the exact same year that we talked about they played Virginia in Japan and that team led of course by back then no h no h who would later became Hocking but was Akim Olajuwon back then before slam a jam and of course Clyde Drexler the number one and number two pick in the NBA draft I saw those guys play at the terrier down I mean you think about that early 80s what a golden age for college hoops absolutely was and what Kelvin Sampson has done there these two teams played last year Virginia and and Houston got together a year ago and of course Houston dismantled the whos on their home court I actually ran into Kelvin Sampson after that at the Maui Invitational in Las Vegas which Houston was in and he said then he said you know Tony theyre going to be really good later and here they are a year later this Virginia team is really good looking forward to seeing that matchup in a couple weeks was done at the line the hoos are now 14 of 18 from the strike and Isaac trout and Leon Bond the third couple of other highly touted freshmen who came in both the red shirting this year for Virginia Applause another turnover and that has been an issue all season long for Florida State when you look around and you talk about corn on the Ford youre playing a freshman a softball point guard in Worley a sophomore Matthew Cleveland in a transfer in Darren Green so the majority of the Seminole lineup that Leonard Hamilton has on the floor to finish the game have very little experience in this uniform especially in these type of moments 90 seconds to go on the back cut Beekman went up thinking he was going to slam it lost it here come the Seminoles at the other end no Chase is at the green for three thats one of those plays where youre almost glad you missed the layup even though Jalen Worley not happy about missing the layup he doesnt get the two points but does get an assist tracking down his own basketball and finding green for three making it a seven point game down to stretch well Florida State got off it to its worst start to a season since 195960 losing their first four I mean youve seen him now a couple of times recently what do you make do you think theyre still making strides as we start ACC play I do think that they are making strides theyre concern with Florida State right now in my opinion is I think theyre lacking experience and again when you say experience not just from the standpoint of playing college basketball but experience in Leonard Hamiltons system it is different and the way that you have to play and be successful most of the guys that are on the floor right now and playing in the in you know on this roster if they havent done it and they also dont have the leadership from guys who have done it in the past and been in the program for two and three years to be able to teach it to the younger guys I think thats the challenge thats been facing coach ham and his staff all season long Music Seminoles with some full court pressure Kihei Clark can run the Baseline with a minute 16 to go Don gives it back to Clark about the shoe again bounced it out of bounds and its Florida State basketball and the officials are going to most likely go and review this one Applause oh no they know immediately that theyre not if Im Tony Bennett Im asking for a review on that one under two minutes they can go over and check it out but Ron Gruber and Doug sermons The Two officials closest to the play looked at each other and said nope we got it right they got it absolutely right great job by the fishing crew not wasting time they had it right it went off Kias foot the foot with no shoot Cleveland seven holes still alive down five with under a minute to go we talked about the heroics of Matthew Cleveland a year ago and right now Florida State making this interesting down the stretch what was a 10point game for Virginia Applause now I believe the officials are talking about the fact that the clock did not stop as the basketball goes through you see is still moving the clock goes from one minute all the way down to 524 now in the first half the clock does not stop or May baskets at the end of the half but in the second half it is supposed to stop as soon as the ball clears the net the clock should stop so great job by this officiating crew once again going over and correcting the mistake Music for Corey after a scoreless first half I asked you to start of the second half what does FSU need to do to get Matthew Cleveland going and he scored right then and there on a back cut nice pass after going over four in the first half now four for five in the second half just need to see one go through thats it oftentimes just need to see the ball go through the basket get that confidence going Music clock operator on point under one minute the basket the clock is supposed to stop but there was actually 101 on the clock when the shot went through so Ron Gruber coming over making sure we know that the clock operator did it correctly and I believe I was wrong did I say two minutes yes youd like to just point out that I was wrong I wasnt going to but you did okay two minutes is when they can review certain things over two minutes so one minute the clock stops after a May bucket so see how the whos handled the pressure this time Clark got himself in trouble and then the foul is called with 493 on the clock so if the Matthew Cleveland shot would have been made two seconds earlier Miss hard two seconds later the clock would have stopped and it would have been 59 seconds along the clock but being that the shot went through with 101 on the clock you do not have to stop it see were all learning on the Fly no doubt dont try to act like you knew that coming in its better to let them think you know what youre talking about and say something improve I bet you dont know what youre talking about Cora well I kind of made a living doing that now so no need me stopping at this point well another good aspect of the whos although Clark misses there now six of seven on the day their three primary perimeter players Clark Beekman and Franklin are all very very good at the free throw line and theres a lot of time left in this game a Miss free throw right there for Kihei Clark is Big makes a second one but still a two possession game with more than enough time remaining for multiple possessions for Florida State Gardner defending the inbound by Cleveland and it comes to Caleb Mills Applause from behind by Gardner never saw the second Defender coming and so itll be Florida State basketball on the Baseline Big Time played by Gardner right there recognizing Kihei was B oh big bucket twopoint shot from the Baseline by Green and right now you see just a different bounce to the steps of the Seminoles Virginia breaks the pressure still working more clock and now the foul is given by Chandler Jackson and you can tell the importance of this game for Virginia as you see the inbounds play and you look that left foot on the line for Darren Green Jr who knocks down the two the difference in inches there of making it a one possession game then but now the fivepoint lead up to six as Reese beef and calmly go to the line and knocks down two just like the 86 percent foul shooter that he is crowd guns to its feet here in jpj green short Cleveland tracks down the rebound he puts up a runner well short out of bounds the officials confer and it will stay with the Seminoles Theres an opportunity here to review this one as Doug sermons looks at Ron Gruber and says that we will go check that one out I keep calling Doug Doug Simons I keep calling the wrong name why didnt you correct me on that I just think youre saying my name every time foreign Music oh but but heres the thing its about who it goes off of you see vanderplas hits it but does Cameron Fletcher hit it also on the way out and I think so but his Camp reaches for it with the left hand does that say did he hit it I dont think theres enough evidence to overturn it regardless right there and we do know that benefits does hit the basketball yeah I think they got that right and I think the indication was theyre going over to check to see if the shot hit the rim and if they should Music well I mean with 186 remaining Music but do we have a clock on there 18 seconds I think that does hit the rim if you see the trajectory of the basketball changes when it gets close to the rim can we rewind that back guys up that does that does hit the rim that basketball looks as though it changes directions quite a bit boy Im not so sure youre not so sure no well its not the first time you and I disagreed on things and thats okay I mean the ball continued to rotate the same I didnt see a difference in we can see the other angle that we showed previously Music well they put 17 back on the shot clock so look at this one right here can you see how the ball goes down more so I still dont see that you dont see that now okay well 17 seconds on the shot clock so does it reset regardless and I dont think thats why they went over there to look off the inbound an easy layup for Cleveland 5854 and time out by Florida State right now fourpoint game 171 remaining and if you remember the heroics of Matthew Cleveland a year ago if youre Virginia you do not want to have this in a one possession game coming down to the end with one second remaining it was Cleveland on a 75foot inbounds pass knocking down a three at the buzzer one difference though the man who delivered that pass last year Arielle Prieto is not here do they have somebody else who can throw as good a pass as last year this beauty by Prieto Im not sure if they have someone is good to throw the pass but theyve got a guy good enough to make the shot because hes still on the floor and hes having a nice second half hes having a very nice second half Matthew Cleveland stepping up his production and just when and again all you dont often see Virginia squander leaves late in games they were up double digits with under three minutes remaining in this game but give Florida State a lot of credit for continuing the fight and finding a way to make this interesting at the end Music Applause all right we want to let you know that the football game that will follow us here on ESPN2 is underway over on ESPN news and well get you to it just as soon as we are finished here at John Paul Jones Arena Music start of ACC play and even though the records coming in were quite disparate 60 for Virginia 18 for Florida State I dont think either of us is surprised that its going down to the wire not at all the contrasting Styles between these two teams is what makes is always a great matchup when you get an opportunity to see Florida State defensive pressure and the way that they switch everything and of course Virginias defensive ability and now their ability to score the basketball this year but Florida State took them out of a lot of that throughout this game 58 points for Virginia pretty much a full game thus far Rhys Beekman turns it over Kihei Clark cut off his route and the book in the ending has been somewhat of a disaster for Virginia thus far the turnovers the mishandling of the basketball missing free throws has given the nose an opportunity s come back into the game for Florida State the inbound goes down Applause hmm that did not look good the Junior from Vashon High School in St Louis helped off the floor after this ah Music Music Chandler Jackson returns for FSU and so Chandler Jackson will come in its Virginia basketball with 155 seconds remaining Clark followed by Mills still 146 remaining a lot of time on the clock PA Clark with the opportunity to make us a sixpoint game the 146 is more than enough time for two possessions for the Knowles Virginia has to go to the line and take care of their business because the door is still open for Florida State Clark now eight of nine today the Wahoos are 18 of 23 from the line Tony Bennett going to pull everyone off the line to make sure theyre back defensively but you dont want to go Retreat too far back and give Florida State an open run into a wide open three a couple of clutch free throws or the fifth year guard 6054 13 seconds to go Mills with a head of steam up the sideline into the lane gets the call and hell have a chance for a threepoint play and that you really dont want to happen is not only the score an opportunity to make it at one possession game with the free throw for Camp Caleb Mills but also stopping the clock allowing Florida State on a May free throw to set up their defense no timeouts remaining for the Knowles so this was perfect case scenario well then Mills an 81 percent foul shooter on the year its good Applause now can Florida State Force another turnover on the inbound 76 seconds to go they get it into Beekman so Jackson has to give up the foul and so again the 86 percent foul shooter Beekman will walk to the other end of the floor but give Leonard Hamilton to his staff a tremendous amount of credit perfectly executing the ending of this game down double digits under three minutes remaining and finding a way to get to this point putting the pressure on Virginia as Beaker steps up and knocks down the first free throw to make the two possession game again for Coach Hamilton this is a heck of a backtoback game stretch they gave Purdue a game they give Virginia a game but now down five with seven seconds to go house from way downtown no and on opening day in the ACC Virginia hangs on and is now 70 on the year conference players here you wouldnt expect anything less other than a hard contest regardless of the records between these two teams when they get together its always going to be interesting final score third ranked Virginia 62 Florida State 57 for Corey Alexander and our entire crew Im Doug Sherman now we
