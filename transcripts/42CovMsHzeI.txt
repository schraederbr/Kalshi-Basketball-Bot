The Canes in the home white Georgia Tech in the Road Navy An awesome slate of games on a college basketball Saturday starts here in South Beach We are underway between Miami and Georgia Tech And its the Canes that start with the basketball coming off their first road win in nearly two years in the ACC Trey Donaldson at 21 against Wake and he picks up where he left off to open the scoring Right now Jay in the last three games hes averaging over 20 a game Hes playing really well Starting lineup for Georgia Tech a big boost Moila the star freshman back in the lineup He missed the last two games with a high ankle sprain He was a game time decision today So good to see the 610 freshman in there for the Yellow Jackets And he makes a big difference He relieves so much pressure from Bobby Dongo And again hes nearly a double double himself averaging 10 points and eight rebounds as a freshman Take a look at the Miami starting lineup Their starters account for more than 70 of their scoring Reu lines up the three Nothing but the bottom of the net Maliku You and I talked about the steps that hes taken in this game and thats a big part of it His ability to knock down a three We know hes capable of and scoring in the paint Going inside to Cila comes up empty trying to shake off the rust after missing backtoback games Washington through traffic draws the foul Well we mentioned what a strong season it has been for first year head coach Jay Lucas You know previously Duke associate head coach coming over making an instant impact 132 2 and 0 in league play They have won eight straight They have Theyve flipped it quickly here He and his staff have done an unbelievable job forming an identity and executing it in a portal and year one has gone as planned in Jay Lucas eyes High octane offense They average 88 points per game Shoot it better than 50 from the floor Purdue lost the handle Stolen away And a Kai Fleming the freshman is fouled trying to go coast to coast Randolph we talked with Georgia Tech head coach Damon Stoutmire and he told us the Jackets have to be the more desperate team today 12 in league play Thought they played well against Syracuse once they were down 20 They got to play like that from the tip Yeah he expects his team to come out with their literally playing like their hairs on fire And the first person he challenges Lamar Washington his point guard here he feels like he has to take over this team and assume a leadership role Dongo comes up empty Georgia Tech still looking for their offensive rhythm Washington a transition three off the mark Miami will take shots like that in transition They want to get to baseline to baseline as quickly as possible They want to try to score before you set your half court defense You know particularly Washington during this eightgame win streak he scored in double figures in all eight wins So he is not shy Hell let it fly today Hes also an excellent defender too Jay Hes a really good twoway playing guard cheering Washington trying to penetrate draws the foul We got to monitor the fouls because once we started going to the bench I think it favors Georgia Tech Miami is not a very deep team They have relied on their starters for more than 70 of their scoring this season Tried the give and go Stolen away Donaldson picked the pocket and it leads to two in transition Shelton Henderson the fivestar freshman rocks the room Yellow Jackets cannot turn the basketball over They do just like that Just put the two points on the board They get up and down the floor as quickly as anybody They turn it over again The Miami defense dialed in Back to Henderson He hammers it home and Damon Somire says Give me a timeout What a start for the home team Hurricanes applause and cheering What the are we doing Miami out to an early nine nothing lead here as ACC play continues Theyve done it Turning defense into offense And this is how you shoot 517 from the field Just getting out in transition You cannot turn the basketball over again One into the floor to the other Sheldon Henderson their fivestar freshman beneficiary of those two transition opportunities I was about to ask you Randolph how does it help Henderson that hes got so much veteran leadership and experience around him Hes been terrific in his freshman year He has and I think the ceiling for this Miami team is resting on his shoulders cheering his development over the year I think leads to how far this Miami team can go We know what were going to get out of Renew But we know what theyre going to get out of Donaldson but Shelton Henderson if he becomes that true third option look out for the Miami Hurricane Heres Dongo in the paint that rims out No good Georgia Tech still looking for their first basket Another miss layup Well defended by U inside Good ball movement Donaldson wide open Hell usually make you pay Missed it that time Both teams struggle from behind the threepoint line Their strength is in the paint Who can get it going behind the threepoint line Be a huge bonus Lamar Washington finally breaks through and Georgia Tech is on the board Start said its got to be Washington Hes the guy settled his team down Has the ability to knock down shots and get to the rim Anderson a quick trigger knocks it down from three Its not a strength of his Only shoots 26 from behind the arc but hes becoming more and more comfortable Washington And now Payton Marshall getting his first touch Shot clock down to six Marshall has to hurry He lost the handle And thats a turnover Another Georgia Tech outstanding in year number one His only two losses are both to top 10 teams Had a 122 lead here at home Looking to extend an eightgame winning streak Couldnt have scripted a better start Thats an offball foul You got Curwak trying to run over the guard Trey Donison tried to set the screen the back screen Theyre trying to run Malik Reu in the post there See him stick that elbow toward the throat area Cant do that Purdue in attack mode Dribbles into trouble Passes out of it Finds Allen for a three He cant bury it Georgia Tech just cant find an offensive rhythm Nearly five minutes of this game only one basket Theyve turned it over four times Kelly draws the foul there working against Allen And when youre missing shots Randolph and youre turning the ball over it lends to easy baskets the other way Four of Miamis five baskets to start this game are off assists in transition before the Jackets can get set defensively Yeah you and I have covered the Yellow Jackets here a bunch lately and they seem to come out slow They get punched in the mouth and then they respond with a level of desperation But right now looking like guys like Chaz Kelly coming off the bench is going to have to give him a lift So there are no easy passes when you face this Miami defense nearly had another takeaway there Georgia Tech will get the ball back Shot clock at 12 Do a great job of guarding their yard meaning they want to keep their defender in the paint out of the paint keep him in front trying to contest the basketball rebound the shot and get out and run Mustaf lost his footing lost his dribble Shot clock down to one but they didnt realize it And thats another turnover The defense continues to be dialed in for the Hurricanes And now with Lamar Washington out of the game its got to be a guy like Chaz Kelly Yeah I didnt think I dont know how thats not a travel but five turnovers in five minutes Not the recipe on the road especially when David starter said he need a desperate attack minded start to this game and youre already down 10 But being desperate means you still got to slow down and execute Right now they look to be in a hurry Washington the floater doesnt fall Rebound bounces out Purdue reathers Donaldson walks into a three and buries it Trey Donaldson throw the numbers away I know hes only shooting 33 but hes so comfortable I even talked to the Georgia Tech staff about him no matter how his game is going When it gets to the last 3 to 5 minutes he thinks hes the best player on the floor And I think its why this Miami team is so dangerous outside of them being a really good team Ball screen there Theres no switch Theres no communication Jay Mustafs got to find a way to fight over that screen Whats amazing about Miami is they are 2 and0 in ACC play shooting a combined eight of 40 from three just 20 So if you start getting the threepoint shot going for Donaldson and others Miami will even hit another level here Jay they lost to Wake Forest giving up 51 from the field and 51 from the threepoint line and they still found a way to win And they do that by defending forcing shots and controlling the glass And right now theyre turning the Yellow Jackets over Yeah that win against Wake Forest the first road win in league play in nearly two years And they come back here to Coral Gables The football teams advance to the national championship Theyre on an eightgame winning streak Everything coming up Miami so much momentum at a 13point lead early How does Georgia Tech ignite this offense Randolph One its got to move It cant be one pass Heres another turnover Jay Seven turnovers for Georgia Tech in their first 12 possessions of this game Look at that Eight straight wins 100 at home And the football team we were just talking about them a program record 13 victories One more until youre immortal in South Florida They get a home game at Stadium Home game How about that Against Indiana of course their quarterback Heisman winner Mendoza Hes from this area So lots to talk about here in South Florida And you can feel the palpable buzz in Coral Gables When you got the football team rolling it helps that Jay Lucas has turned this basketball program around Yeah it has Its fun to see the basketball program catching up to football because this program has been as dominant historically as any Some of the greatest football players ever played this sport has played at the U A lot of those alums have come back to the games probably most notably Michael Irvin whos become a social media star Jay Lucas is turn this thing around for basketball quickly Struggled the last two years this year 13 and two and showing no signs of slowing down Well youve talked to me before Randolph about the importance for a first year head coach to come in with an identity with a brand And Jay Lucas has done that He has Hes done it with his staff He has coaches that have had head coach experience And when you have when youre inexperienced he comes to a program and he needs to jump start You see the identity right away You see the effects of his presence from recruiting You can flip a kid like Shelton Henderson who was committed to Duke So much talent coming out of state of Florida And when you score 88 points per game people are going to notice you Thats what Miami has done which leads the ACC And they do it by sharing the basketball Buday finishes the alleyoop This is the team that leads the ACC in assists And you see why there Trey Donson picked up that second foul And Draat comes in again Hes a solid point guard takes care of the basketball Hes going to get them in the offense And there he turns the corner and throws the lob to Uday Payton Marshall just added two points from the free throw line but Georgia Tech doesnt have a basket in four minutes as UD hammers it home Great job there getting in the paint You got to keep the defender the offensive guy above the screen When youre Marshall when youre in drop coverage he gets behind you give up lobs And another turnover where they continue to pile up here for Georgia Tech That is eight turnovers in less than eight minutes for David Satires team Theyre going to extend their pressure trying to pick up manto man here I wouldnt surprise me if Stardmire falls back into some type of zone Right now Miami is getting everything they want offensively Theyre not taking away threepoint opportunities and more importantly theyre not offering much resistance at the rim either And Miami has cashed in 10 points off those Georgia Tech turnovers 13point lead in the drivers seat of this first half Good defensive stop there by the Yellow Jackets Thats the way you play drop coverage there by by Dongo Kesi Reeves drives baseline and they turn it over again Nine turnovers and only four points for Georgia Tech trying to spark some life here on the road Fleming nearly turned it over again Theyre going to call that a kick against Miami but it is all hurricane Three Assist to turnover ratio Fleming the freshman Good look from three Missed it Good hustle there to keep the possession alive Lacy Reed with the basketball has got to find a way to get himself going Dango split two couldnt finish at the rim And when you have more turnovers than points thats not a good recipe on the road Georgia Tech struggling in that department at least on the last possession they got two good looks and just couldnt finish them You mentioned Reeves Hes their leading scorer Hes not factored yet Yeah here Great job defensively by Craft coming over Washington outmatched on a switch with Ray New and great defense possession there by the Yellow Jack They got to get stops like this but they got to figure something out on the offensive end of the floor Well they go to Reeves their leading scorer and he cashes in First basket in 5 minutes and 30 seconds for Georgia Tech Well hes way too quiet Hadnt gotten enough shot attempt Thats his first shot of this game and youre Georgia Techs leading scoreer Hes got to be more aggressive Washington rims in and out No good Lot of basketball left and thats how you get back in this game Force Miami to beat you from behind the threepoint line On New Years Eve we were at Cameron Indoor Georgia Tech They were the better team against Duke for about 30 minutes of that matchup So you know theyre capable of playing at a high level on the road that has not resulted in in wins And you thought okay if they can get a strong start today be behind Lamar Washington and Kesi Reeves you get CILA back in the lineup and the turnovers have killed them Their defense has actually kept them in this game enough I mean just a 10point deficit despite all the struggles on the offensive end Jay thats the answer to the riddle for this group Can they put together 40 minutes Some of that has to do with players in and out of the lineup They theyve done jobs like that where they play 35 36 minutes They spotted Syracuse 20 20 and cut it to five Like this team isnt going anywhere Theyre going to compete and find a way to fight back in this game But do they have enough on the offensive end to dig themselves out of the holes that they find themselves in And now its Miami thats fallen into a scoring drought of 2 and 12 minutes A ninepoint lead is Cushion Donaldson Nice crossover Got to the rim Count it Plus the foul Trey Donaldson Hes the difference Hes the difference with these two teams I believe I mean hes a guy that again not many guys in college basketball guardwise has that taste in their mouth of knowing what its like when it matters the most showing up in big moments winning games He does Thats why Jay Lucas identified him quickly and knows theyre going to have a chance no matter who theyre on the floor But all they have to do is rely on their defense keep it close He knows he has a closer in Trey Donaldson Donaldson completes the threepoint play the oldfashioned way Miami back up by 12 Hurricanes had missed five of their last six before that Donaldson make Yeah theyre going to run their fullourt pressure fall back into their zone This is when you want to find 12 Craft shot over 40 from three a year ago And it said another turnover Risky pass pays off on the outlet pass Washington He was looking like a Hurricanes wide receiver in the Old Miss secondary the other night And goes down hard after getting fouled Still sitting in the seat there adjusting nearly stepped out of his shoe there after the foul Does a great job there Initiates the contact here Thought the officials may call it He extended the arm there and got away with it You see him rose his ankle a little bit there Donaldson and Renu have stolen the headline to the transfer portal Obviously Henderson the highly touted freshman but Drew Washington he has been a differencemaker particularly during this eightgame win streak been a very consistent scorer coming in from New Mexico Really good twoway guard Jay capable scorers third scorer when they need it Hes a really good defender second in the ACC in steals Fits the identity just a great job of identifying what they wanted in the portal Knocks them both down from the line So a 228 lead Yellow Jackets just cant stop turning the ball over Theyve got 10 Reeves in the corner And thats where the Yellow Jackets have been needing Kasi Reeves drills the three Hes got to get aggressive Hes been shooting the lights out from behind the threepoint line Washington scoop to the hoop for two So much for his ankle injury To me the ball has healing powers when it finds you on the offensive end of the floor Throws his ankle goes to the free throw line knocks down two All is well Reeves open again Hell usually make you pay from there Yellow Jacks need to slow down just a little bit now Theyre not going to get this all back in one moment Purdue called for the offensive foul Pushed off there Same thing could go for Miami I think Manique Rein drives it Really good defense there by way Reed sliding his feet Both teams are better offensively when the ball gets to the second or third side Miami just has not had to do that because of the turnovers by Yellow Jacks and their ability to get out in transition 10 Georgia Tech turnovers only 11 points scored Nearly turned it over again Good read there by Washington Look for Wacy Reeves in the middle of that zone when he flashes Really good score from there You got to midrange that right there Right on Q Randolph Childris Its like they heard you over here laughter two three zone there Want to put your score with his size and ability He can look over the defense Well every coach will tell you can you get it to that ACC logo against the zone Its just easier said than done but that time Reeves did it very effectively And now for Georgia Tech its about yes getting points but stringing together stops as you try and cut in to this Hurricanes lead Miami started this game on a nine nothing run and a then a 152 run to balloon this lead early You know since then Georgia Techs played them even But now can you cut back the other way One issue Georgia Tech has defensively is they also have to learn to defend without fouling And theres another whistle laughter And that sends Miami into the bonus So both teams in the bonus for the remaining 8 minutes and 35 seconds of this first half Here now Trey Donson with two fouls Got to be you got to monitor his minutes and give him a break when you need it Came back in for a few minutes Now hes coming back out He may see a few more minutes here later in the half Uday the front end of the one and one earns the second Tell you thats big for him to make that first one Uday is not a strong free throw shooter Makes them both But hes been brought in as the rim protector the guy cleaning up the glass with rebounds veteran player from TCU but proving his ability from the foul line there His job is to rebound and finish at the rim and hes doing that at a very high level The home team Hurricanes doubling up Georgia Tech 2613 Missed layup and Ud rips down the rebound Henderson left alone missed it Chaz Kelly finds Dongo underneath He cashes in for two Thats as easy a look as by Dongo is going to get usually draws a crowd but great job by the guards getting in the paint forcing Ud to step up No one behind him no one to help the helper Heres Dante Allen Nine seconds on the shot clock You have a chance here to make a run if youre Georgia Tech Stolen away Battle for the ball Reeves has it up ahead Heres Lamar Washington COUNT IT PLUS THE FOUL Defense to offense Tide lifts all boats So if youre the Miami basketball team or any sport here at Coral Gables you should be a benefit of that Weve got a good game here after Georgia Tech has stormed back Miami led 22 to8 but the Yellow Jackets have swung momentum Theyve made five of their last seven Can they string together a couple of more stops here Great job there of Malik Reu Theyre trying to help him inside Shot clock down to four Washington has to hurry Launches a three bakes it in You couldnt defend any better but Drew Washington gets it off the glass and in Sometimes its better to be lucky than good Tough take and its another and one opportunity for Lamar Washington He is in attack mode right now And thats number two on Malik Reu Now both stars for Miami with two fouls Lamar Washington drives takes the contact kisses it off the glass with the lefty lay And Damon told us its got to be Lamar Washington Hes just too experienced Hes used to high a lot of times mid major guys will come up to high high major basketball and struggle He started at Texas Tech He knows what this looks like Hes got to take control of this team and shows the level of toughness that Damon starter knows he has in him Well when Nate George their point guard the last two seasons left for Syracuse its no surprise Damon Stoutmire a lefthanded point guard from Portland went and got a lefthanded point guard from Portland Loves his toughness He did He went home and found somebody that he knew a lot about that has the same mental makeup that he has Mighty Mouse was tough You dont get a name like Mighty Mouse without being tough I think what frustrates Statamire is his team has battled in these games They just dig themselves a hole at times and that has happened today Miami started this game up 9 nothing and then 152 Ballooned it all the way to 228 And Georgia Tech has battled back but Miami still with a cushion here a ninepoint advantage with Donaldson at the free throw line Those are the maddening things that coach Dartmire is dealing with with this team Theyve shown they can play with anybody but they will just have a TV timeout or two where theyre not quite in the game and it cost them They fall they fall in big runs They dug themselves in a hole to start this game Now they battled back Can they finish this half strong Reeves pump fake Pull up pop that rims out No good Donaldson already with 10 points Hes had double figures in every game hes played this season This fires that one Georgia Tech has numbers in transition Kelly a three Hits it Chaz Kelly Hes been a big boost off the bench He has settled into that role Hes becoming instant offense off the bench Taking really good shots Commits the foul there guarding Donaldson Statire not happy about it Yeah he expected a guard with Chaz Kellys experience there Does a great job here knocking down a three ball in the corner Comes back on the other end and gives potentially gives it back with the foul on Trey Donaldson And thats Kellys third foul Hes had a tough assignment working against Donaldson And this is critical because youre putting Miami on the line When they have a lineup on the floor that struggles to score right now their number one option Renu is on the bench with two fouls Jay Lucas will leave him there if he can And remember Trey Donison has two himself so he has to be careful He cant be too aggressive number seven and Miami a perfect nine for nine from the foul line Georgia Tech started painfully slow one of 10 but they have made seven of their last 10 That one off the mark Thats a quick shot there by Chaz Kelly Hes got to let the offense happen First side no ball movement And then again another quick foul by Georgia Tech Yeah Miami has feasted from the free throw line this season They averaged 29 free throw attempts per game I think when you look at how does Miami score 88 points per game best in the ACC you have to factor in their ability to get to the free throw line and convert Well thats what they do Jay is a sense they dont shoot a ton of threes When theyre making threes thats a bonus As you lamented in ACC play theyre eight for 40 Theyre shooting 20 When theyre getting threes look out They can beat anybody but they beat you by defending rebounding controlling the paint and get to the free throw line on the offensive end This is part of how they score Yeah they have found ways under first year head coach Jay Lucas to overcome a lack of threepoint making and this is from a team thats not very deep So this is why its also important they dont have a lot of scoring from their bench They lost Marcus Allen whos out with uh nonhopkins lymphoma for the season Reeves through traffic draws the foul Theres Allen who you were just talking about I joked with him yesterday Hes a coach now So theyre getting on him keeping him involved His job as his coach guys as they come in and out of the line of the game says hes doing great Hes feeling great His spirits are up as hes rocking the four strong shirt Yeah you hear a lot about him going forward just amazing character out of that young man And now Georgia Techs turn to cash in from the free throw line Theyre a perfect eight for eight Both teams shooting it very well from the stripe Where is the offense going to come from right now for the Hurricanes How about Henderson The fivestar freshman is fouled and now its his turn to shoot two Its turned into a free throw shooting contest in the last couple of minutes here Thats by Dongo Second foul And Jay hes a guy again Hes just so I think hes the most critical part to the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets team And foul trouble has just hindered his development injuries and staying out of foul trouble We watched him last week He got three fouls in a minute and 30 seconds Hes got to protect his fouls Hes just too important to this team David Satamire does leave Dongo in the game with those two fouls I just dont know if he can take him out He has to His presence on both ends of the floor particularly with this lineup again Miami out there and how dominant Miami is on the glass When a player struggles continually in constant foul trouble what would you tell him to adjust that part of his game you would expect him to know by now as a junior right And that the fact that he doesnt know you cant trust him But one thing I think that hurts him is his conditioning because hes in and out of the lineup Hes missed four games this year You maybe run some zone to try to protect him inside Five minutes left to this first half Miami leading by eight Henderson left all alone Nothing but the bottom of the net for the fivestar freshman Shelton Henderson I think its about time teams take notice You got to stop giving him those dare shots And thats a dare shot You look at his percentage and youre leaving him out there saying Ill let you make two or three before I guard you Well hes already made two and he wins the ball back on the defensive end That is why over the last four games Henderson is averaging 33 minutes per game They cant take him off the court Hes been so good Just such a physical specimen here Coach Christians looking for his tight end next year I think I know a guy 66 240 I I if you were Jay Lucas youre keeping coach Crystal Ball as far away from Henderson You talked about that 20 mil they got I I Im coach Crystal Ball Im making a call Well hes got the pedigree too Hes Eric Dickersons nephew of course Pro Football Hall of Famer one of the best running backs to ever play the sport He is And Eric Dixon was a big running back to me He didnt built like that laughter Youre a defensive back You dont want him coming at you He Hes not in football shape at all But he does just not look like a freshman No hes not He doesnt And his games coming around And hes bought into if its a fivestar hes hes bought into the defensive end of the floor He knows his strength and weaknesses and again his the ceiling of this Miami team is going to depend on his development He can start knocking down that three like he did today and he has in this first half Look out music By the way you brought up coach Crystal Ball and weve said it throughout the day Thursday night Miami advancing to the national championship game at Hard Rock Stadium He was giving an interview to ACC Network our crew He had 4800 unread text messages Ive never heard that 4800 I I think its bad that I have 48 That would drive me crazy on my phone Oh yeah Cuz I have to answer all those text messages Are you kidding me A deep three Wow Nothing but the bottom of the net The junior sharpshooter Noam Doat the junior from Israel in Miami scored 40 in this first half Hes just solid Hes just play and largely they have won those games without shooting the three very effectively You know conference play coming into today just 20 from three Well today theyve been terrific from beyond the arc Six of 13 at a 12point lead to show for it Theyve just struggled mightily from out of the threepoint line And again Jay Lucas knew when he assembled this team this is not a great threepoint shooting team And days like today when youre making shots from three great but their identity is on the defensive end of the floor controlling the plane attacking you getting to the foul line and theyre doing that as well as anyone Well Jay Lucas team got out to a nine nothing start and then led 152 since they ballooned that lead early Georgia Tech has cut it to seven but they havent gotten closer than that So its been a comfortable first half for Miami Up by 10 325 to go I like that Fullourt pressure there Got a trap out of it Just trying to disrupt the Hurricanes offensive rhythm Get the rhythm of the game back Plenty of time to get back Theyre only down 10 Pull up pop Washington That rims out no good Get Lamar Washington in some type of ball screen action Let him get in the paint Dumps it off this time Dongo through traffic for two and Jay Lucas takes it to against Hannah Halgo and the fighting Irish Yeah I think two teams that have expectations to go deep in March and a big opportunity to get a resume win there Miami I dont know if they started the expectation on the mens side with getting to March but theyve certainly played themselves into that expectation A 132 start eightgame win streak trying to keep that going here at home Do misfires that one Here comes the Yellow Jackets continue to get downhill They dont want to foul starter is saying what coach Green and I have been saying all the first half they keep if theyre turnovers that come because theyre trying to score off the first side Get it to the second to third side then attack Get downhill becomes a lot easier And right now this Miami Hurricane team does not want to foul Well free throws for Georgia Tech have kept them in it in this first half Theyre a perfect 12 for 12 So Miami fouling has been the Yellow Jacketss most consistent offense Jaden Mustaf right to the lane Well defended Renu just walled up there Just a little bit more patience there for Mustaf Hell know Renu does not want to foul Lines up the three Got it Malik Renu drains it and Miami is back up 11 Its a fivepoint swing You get to the rim and miss the layup Give up a three Dango finds Reeves He cant connect on a triple Battle for the board One by Mustaf but he turns it over Dovra through two Somehow keeps his dribble HENDERSON FLIES in and hes got an and one opportunity Ive really been impressed with this first half with Dubra I mean his ability there in traffic to handle that I mean look at this He finds the loose ball but prior to that dribbling through traffic finds his teammate Shelton Henderson And again youre not going to win that physical contact in the air with him Getting into him ways youre better off getting out of the way there Youre not going to foul him and keep him from getting it up Henderson cant convert the threepoint play Miami leads by 13 though Every time Georgia Tech has gotten it within striking distance Miami has punched back Foul called with the body there U flew in and even though he got all ball with the hands got him with his chest If Im David starting again Im telling my guys to do this every time Drive the music basketball to the rim Miami wants shot blocking I dont know if I like the call but doesnt matter what I like Its Us second foul Well he definitely got the ball cleanly with his hands but I I think he got him with the chest But youre allowed to go vertical Yeah I mean hes telling officials Im allowed to go vertical But this is the concern with Miami As we said theyre not a deep team U has two fouls Renu has two fouls Trey Donelsson has two fouls Something to monitor certainly in the second half That was the first free throw miss Georgia Tech has had in this first half 13 for 13 before that Henderson Hes had the hot hand That one rims out No good Got to remove the basketball Get it to the second and third side now with Tack He doesnt want a foul Washington went right into contact looking for a foul and didnt get one Donaldson great pass HENDERSON WITH A RIM ROCKER Jay Trey Donaldson doesnt get the national attention from that position but again hes 16 and six a game Coming off 216 in a road win against Wake Forest snapping a 2year road losing streak for the Hurricanes And he is as good a closer as there is in college basketball Craft a logo three no good 4 seconds left of the first half It ticks down to 27 but Miami closes the final couple of minutes holding Georgia Tech without a basket in 2 minutes and 42 seconds And theyve ballooned this lead back to 14 which is the largest of the game Theyre going to try to get Trey Donaldson catching it on the move but they cant throw it to half court Heres Trey Donaldson Donaldson got a good look misses it Monitor here A lot of stars and a lot of players here with two fouls Picking up that third foul early can send you to the bench can sway this game in the first five minutes Trey Donaldson has the ball here to start the second half Number three in white 12 points five assists Continues to be the playmaker that makes this Miami offense go Foul trouble we talked about Wy Reed is not matched up Henderson went for the twohanded slam there and was fouled hard Nothing Georgia Tech could do with Henderson at 240 66 with a head of steam Just a great back door cut Reeve goes to help on dribble Great instincts by Henderson on a back door cut and Bongo picks up a foul here and its his third You just mentioned right before the second half started who picks up that early third foul and it belongs to Bango The last thing Georgia Tech needed to see because if they were going to come back in this game youd think Dongo would be the biggest reason why And its also important because Mohamed Ca started the game but has not played since the opening 2 minutes and 30 seconds and he hasnt started the second half So it looks like we saw him walk in the game in the boot He tried to give it a go unable to play and magnifies foul situation with Bongo Three players now with three fouls for Georgia Tech Makes a comeback effort that much harder on the road Trailing by 15 Largest deficit theyve faced today Fleming the freshman stolen away And its Donaldson who has it Leaves it for Henderson Washington rejected on his way to the rim Itll stay Miami basketball Theyre putting Jaden Waf on Malik Reo here as you can see Great help there by Flemings music with Bongo sitting in the paint with three fouls Look at the matchup at the top Jaden Mustaf physically allows you the ability to play him at the four Miami a little sloppy with the turnover If Georgia Techs going to come back from down 15 how do they do it One starts with 11 of desperation This guy with the basketball Washington had a really strong first half He had 12 points and three assists Hes got to get really aggressive Can they find a secondary story I score I thought Wacy Reeds had his moments And they got to try to find a way We talked about Bongo getting involved in this game Hes got to be a guy as well Mustaf trains the three Maybe thatll ignite a comeback for Georgia Tech on the road As we talked about too youre talking about Shelton Henderson getting dare shots Theyre going to do the same thing with Jaden Mustaf Offensive rebound cleaning up the spill Ernest Uday from Miami I am tacking the paint No size at the rim Only by Dongo He has three fouls Dongo A three Got it Backto back threes for Georgia Tech This is Georgia Tech They get down and then they play with a level of desperation and theyre really dangerous when they do So Renu no stopping him on the inside Theres nothing else Bongo could do there He comes over to rotate Thats just an old ACC first team playing like one Washington risky pass and he turned it over Freshman Flemings there He drives I think he committed to passing early so fast he looks to score I think he makes the defense react a little differently They go back to Renew lob to the rim U there big man to big man on the alleyoop Everyone in the arena thinking he was going to pull up and take the midrange Renu has great touch for 69 240 The biggest reason why Miami has surged this season to a 132 record undefeated in ACC play that looks like its going to continue barring a Georgia Tech comeback and by tongo and the jackets not going away Great job there attacking that zone Great job there Lamar Washington on the baseline with the basketball finding by Dongo who cuts in front of the basket there Good patience Donaldson a three No good Risky pass and its intercepted Anderson in attack mode off the window for two You cannot turn the basketball over They just turn into pick sixes 18 points off turnovers So its one thing if youre Georgia Tech and you turn it over 14 times but Miami has cashed it in for 18 points Thats the difference in this game It is and ask Oregon football team about that You start a game with a pick six and theyre just hard to overcome Its just too easy High level sports its just difficult to to win Winning is hard and its made a lot easier when you force turnovers and get out and get easy baskets And Miamis been doing a great job of that all season long Reeves yet to get going GOES BASELINE ONEHANDED JAM Maybe thatll ignite Coaci Reeves the Georgia Tech leading scorer He can get it going And again I would attack Ray New every possession Theres Renew on the offensive end Passes it off Washington Renu so crafty Cant convert Gets it on the second effort Malik Renu tell you thats the difference with a game like this You get in a tight moment They can just run a screen get him the basketball in the middle of the floor and say go make me a play Shot clock down to seven Lamar Washington finds Dongo and he lays it up and in So Georgia Tech theyve made five straight baskets but they havent cut into this lead cuz they cant get a stop on the other end They cant get stops right now but theyre at least starting to score the basketball They say Trey Donaldson stepped out of bounds So ball back to Georgia Tech Youre talking about two guys thatll definitely be first team all ACC performers Now of course Camboozer the nations leading scorer been terrific for the Blue Devils this season Shot clock down to five Kelly has to hurry finds Dongo who beats the buzzer but couldnt convert But theres a foul on the rebound and thatll keep the possession with the Yellow Jackets Great job there You got to muck the game of junk it up Little plays going to the glass right now Washington Bedongo and Wacy Reeves are going to make enough plays on the offensive end Can they get production from those other two spots here You can see the push in the back there by True Washington The two hands and once you extend those arms it makes it easy for the officials to call Reeves cashes in on the extra possession And Georgia Tech has converted six of their first eight shots in this second half And theyre in the long Theyre in there Started out in the match up zone Now theyre in manto man Theyre going to try to get Malik Ray Newu in the post because he has Jaden Mustaf guarding You got to give him the basketball And he does get it Crosscourt pass finds Allen into the lane Kick out A three Donaldson buries it Trey Donaldson always delivers You got to find him on a threepoint line Hes the one guy in that in that lineup right now You cannot lead behind the threepoint line Now Georgia Tech they have improved in this second half on the offensive end but they cant get a stop to cut into this Miami lead Yeah Trey Washington Okay Lamar Washington comes over and tries to help but its a cleared side Trey Donson slides to the corner No one there to help Hes not going to miss many open threes like that Reeves the floater doesnt drop Offensive rebound Dongo Washington almost had another offensive board but ripped away by Henderson Just when Georgia Tech has a chance something like that happens Miami just takes it away Every time theyve gotten within striking distance Miami has had the answer Theyve cut it as close to seven Dongo Nice turnaround there I am feeding him He touches it every trip down the floor in this lineup No one on the floor right now with Miami as long as Malik Renu is in foul trouble can guard him Well Ernest Dude coming over to check in Its like a big shadow coming over as you get to see it Its like the sun is blocked out the Donaldson He is such a crafty player Just does such a good job getting his shot off getting to the free throw line when Miami needs a bucket Hes playing the position as well as anyone Hes just not getting the national recognition here Just getting in the paint Hes so under control scoring it at all three levels really well Well as we said hes averaging 20 and six over the last three games averaging 20 in ACC play and hes well on his way to another 20point game here today And hes got those six assists which is his average for the season You know Miami as a team they lead the ACC in assists per game And that is led by Donaldson Hes also perfect for the free throw line today five for five the last five games Trey Donaldson 53 assists nine turnovers So that is 10 and a half to about two turnovers Its pretty good Jay Hes playing the position as well as anyone And I will add he is as good a closer as there is in college basketball He believes in the last two minutes of a close game that hes the best player on the floor And he has proven many times this season he has been Georgia Tech going a little too quick that time Nearly turned it over Reeves wins it back Finds Washington He finds Dongo and he draws the foul So Georgia Tech theyre making the hustle plays necessary to come back in this game They just cant get a stop on the defensive end Theyre battling here And really this game boils down to the fact that Damon Statamires team came out a little slow on the road Miami got a 152 start including scoring the first nine points of this game From that 152 point on Georgia Techs been even They have been Had they not just turned it over just unforced sloppy turnovers they could very well be leading this game Had was halfway down but somehow rimmed out for Dongo This one You just need one here Allows you a chance to set your defense Georgia Techs defense has struggled to stop Miami leading scoring team in the ACC at 88 points per game They are well past that pace right now with 62 Just under 13 minutes left right now Malik Renews out of the game Im having all hands on deck A foul called as UDay went up for the alioop attempt You got to keep Trey Donaldson out of the paint Easier said than done Yeah it is But you got quoting rotation there Hes drawing extra coverage Im going to make someone else beat me Cant allow him to get to the teeth of the defense Now they call by Dondo for that foul and that is his fourth So he has to come out of this game I thought that foul may have been on Kesi Reeves and again we talked about it Four fouls now Startar has to take him out and thats a big blow The Georgia Tech simply not the same team with him not on the court Allen cashes in for two because now you dont have Cila you dont have Dongo which means you dont have rim protection And Miami has the front court that can make you pay Reeves on the inside Missed it Miami gets it up court in such a hurry Effortlessly Allen missed the transition trailing three Washington upping the tempo and hell get two at the line So Miami still a comfortable lead Next follow in that clip when he said get on the baseline minute 30 they will run it music So he shows you he can joke he can laugh but when its time to hold his guys accountable he does an amazing job of doing that and these guys respect him for it Well they shot out of a canon to start this game a nine nothing run to start ballooned it to 152 and really thats been the difference since and Jay Lucas taking over this program brought in a whole new roster five transfers seven freshman only ACC team with no returnees and they have found instant success in the midst of an eightgame win streak right now 132 overall their only two losses were to top 10 teams of the time Florida and BYU Renu Hes been a big reason why Missed it that time This is the end of the fourth for Georgia Tech right now Who steps up outside of Lamar Washington I think its got to be Wacy Reeds but someone else has to make a play Chaz Kelly has had moments in his reserve role Not many here today And Cam Craft kind of come off the mat Hes played some games early in the year music didnt found himself on the bench and now he finds himself getting quality minutes in ACC play and comes into the reputation as a shooter They can sure welcome some shots from him right about now Shot clock down to five Reeves through contact banks it in Wy Reeves in the tack mode is always a good thing there Great job taking the contact and finishing Well thats the first time in this second half that Georgia Tech has cut the Miami lead under 11 The closest theyve cut it to since they went down 9 nothing early has been seven Watch Renique Renu catching it right there in the mid post The spin cycle Oh Malik Renu showing off You got to know thats coming They go balls going to find him versus zone and particularly with this lineup They do a great job of running him up off the baseline But Georgia Tech in that zone you got to make someone else beat you Reeves pull up pop and it drops in Rattled home for Kaci Reeves These teams trading baskets Same scenario again Got to find a way Keep the ball out of Braz Donaldson splits two Trey Donaldson has taken over That should not happen versus a zone A guard just dribbles right in for an uncontested layup Hes got 18 to lead all scorers Chaz Kelly answers with a three Well Georgia Tech three for three from three in this second half They just cant get a stop to cut this lead down And not only can they get a stop can they secure the rebound This is a really small lineup on the court right now And youre going to have to give some attention to Ray Newton Renu draws the foul Went right in to the sevenoot freshman Kiraak And the issue that this Georgia Tech team has right now is Kiraak comes over to help But youre leaving these guards on the backside to have to deal with Ernest Hudday and thats a difficult task right now How long will Damon start go with by Dongo on the bench even though he has four fouls with Dongo out Renu has started to feast and hes at the free throw line here and his consistency has been huge this season His season low is 14 Think about that Season low is 14 season high 28 transferring in from Indiana You know after the Hooers won last night I was thinking Malik Renu hes got his two schools that hes played for playing for a national championship in football Indiana going against Miami No doubt where his allegiance lies right now but hes gone from a role player at Indiana to a star here in Miami How has he done it I think one is just opportunities Hes been given hes the number one guy now You know before hes been in the secondary role almost like a number two wide receiver Now hes getting the most touches Hes always had the talent Hes more comfortable shooting a three Just really I think is cemented himself as being a first team all ACC guy right now and deserving of some allAmerican consideration Hes been that good Yeah he has elevated his game in a Hurricanes uniform And the dynamic duo Donaldson and Renu continue to dominate not just today but all season for Miami Its been those two He has And again thats just a great play by Ernest Uday there just sealing the lane allowing Trey just to get to the rim for an easy two Georgia Tech continues to get the shots they need to limit Miami from separating Its back to a 10point game Theyre scoring Theyre right there Can they get us a rebound Well think about this Georgia Tech is shooting 65 in the second half and theyre still down by 10 as Renu will go right back to the free throw line And I think you got to think about getting Dongo back in this game cuz Renu theres no answer right now defensively for Georgia Tech Theyre doing a great job on the offensive end of the floor and theyre in a rhythm but right now theres just no size And you see Cam Craft there Ive been in that position before Youre just the best thing he can do at that point is just front But hes so low you dont know if a cross screens coming or a pin down and you dont know how to defend him in that situation as a guard So Renu shooting 59 from the floor And part of that is he gets to places on the floor where he has such a snorts high percentage shot You dont average 21 points per game by accident And with that free throw he now secures the fact that his season low will stay at 14 His season high being 28 and everything else being in between Just such a consistent elite scorer And may I add also hes shooting nearly 59 from the floor Like thats the thing about it where hes why his floor is so low at 14 He just takes high quality shots He knows who he is And because of Renu in the last couple of minutes Georgia Tech despite the offensive efficiency shooting 65 the lead is still 12 for Miami Washington nothing but air Hiak there Ricochets out of bounds Shot clock ticks down to nine Plenty of time to get a good shot here Youre in front of your bench Reeves comes back in gives you another score the lead scorer back in the game Washington step back three Got it Theyre holding on Theyre making shots Theyre scoring in the offensive end Can they get stops Miamis made their last three shots and Purdue has feasted at the foul line Purdue has it here Shot clock down to six in trouble Goes to the rim Missed it Uday there to tip it in Just a concern youre going to have with only one big on the floor Kurowak comes over to help And again you have no chance as a guard blocking down Ernest Uday Slamming the freshman cant connect Its concern you got to have here the Yellow Jackets You start missing shots here then this game can get out of control Offensive rebound again Washington in the paint Draws contact and hell be at the line when we come back Miami up by 11 Still in the drivers seat Oh what a fun day for college basketball A loaded Saturday slate Thank you for the updates guys Randolph Childrisers Jay Alter with you at Coral Gables Miami been in the drivers seat throughout this game got a nine nothing lead right off tip off and have stayed in front by seven or more since theyve been playing through Trey Donaldson and Malik Renu Those two have combined for 17 of the Hurricanes 28 When you have a dynamic duo that have proven that they can close games why wouldnt you go to those two down the stretch Theyve shown time and time that thats what they do And Donaldson at the scores table is about to come back in this game Georgia Tech feel like you got to come back now Like nows the time to make Miami uncomfortable You want to make it a free throw shooting game Make the free throws matter Got to find a way to get this game to a one or two possession game Washington just missed two at the line And now Cam Craft an opportunity to make it a singledigit lead for the Hurricanes Theres Donaldson checking back in But start gets up from the table laughter Start walks over to him like Whyd you come back in the game I thought we had a chance to make a run Well an elite point guard giving another elite point guard some love there You know when you see it he he knows what a really good player at that position looks like Yep Gameresecting game there Absolutely He saw him at the scores table and his head just dropped So the closest Georgia Tech has cut it has been seven Every time they get within striking distance Miami has had the answer Donaldson and the oop Ernest Uday on the receiving end of another great lob When youre Lamar Washington youve played a really good game And I know its gap integrity Youve got to help But when youre guarding Trey Donaldson youve got to stay closer to home with him You go help you get overextended you have a late close out and he blows by you and he doesnt finish hes going to find a teammate Craft to the corner cant knock it down Renu tried for the onehanded jam and instead its a wedgie Its a great play by Bongo not picking up the foul and meeting Malik Rayu at the rim How did he pull this off And how did the ball stay wedged between the hoop and the glass You see Dongo coming in at the end That is a great block Pins it against the backboard Hey that is defying gravity I dont know what its like being up that high So I wouldnt worry about jumping like that Thats just coming out of nowhere with that type of effort We talked about his talent Heres Reeves going for Tongo And those two connect like theyve done so many times in a Jackets uniform He took a hard fall in that Syracuse game Talking about by dongo and hurt his knee missed a lot of time and he usually you see the sleeve on his right leg He usually would catch that and dunk that He has that type of athletic ability but you can see hes a little bit limited but hes just playing through it Donaldson hes been the difference maker Finds Renu Twoman game Shot clock down to three Anderson underneath And thats a shot clock violation Great defense by Georgia Tech to win the ball back Down nine five minutes to play Great defensive possession there Not going to allow Reu to go oneonone inside Help comes the double team They finally rotate over to Donaldelsson from the Yellow Jackets I got to make someone else beat me and its got to be on the perimeter Cant give up lobs to Udy either And with this lineup on the floor its got to be Allen or Washington making shots here on the offensive end for the Yellow Jackers Look for by Dongo when some type of ball screen action Reeds pull up pop Got it Great execution there This is the closest it has been since it was 3124 all the way in the first half Miami has led throughout Largest lead was 15 Georgia Tech wont go away Donaldson it doesnt drop And both teams are small right now And I think that favors Georgia Tech Attack the paint Miami does not want to foul Washington hands it off Dango missed the layup Foul on the floor And you mentioned thats usually an automatic two for Bango Last time out against Syracuse bang that right knee just not getting the lift he normally does Oh hes been laying it up near the rim elevating off of just one leg and hes gutting it out And the foul is called against Malik Renu That is his fourth Now he has to be careful in crunch time here Miami who led this game 9 nothing and 152 and has led throughout and led comfortably now getting tested in the final stretch of this game with 415 to play Georgia Tech ball trailing by seven The last time the Miami lead was under seven It was 6 nothing It was And you execute here on the baseline out of bounds Reeves got it again Backto back makes for Kesi Reeves And its a five done in South Beach A fun finish coming And who could have predicted this Miami looked comfortable A 15point lead is down to five with four minutes to play And Miami stays with this smaller lineup Remember both front line guys have foul trouble Malovitz off the bench A big three Jay hadnt made a field goal all game long One of the big moments in this game He steps up and knocks down a three Reeves has the been the hot hand in the second half Has it here Cashes in plus the foul Kesi Reeves refusing to go away Hes just putting him on his back Its a little aggressive to get going in this game And this is a heck of a shot just gets to his spot gets an angle shooting over the smaller Dante Allen Once he gets the angle and that his length that 6768 when he elevates over smaller perimeter players he just doesnt seem Reeves now up to 23 points and in this second half he has taken over This is the and one opportunity It stays a sixpoint lead for Miami The Hurricanes trying to cling on to this lead find the finish line with under three minutes and 30 seconds to play Donaldson finds Renu Its been these two down the stretch and thats the fifth foul against by Dongo So Dongo fouls out and Renu heads to the free throw line Thats his fifth foul and this is a big foul We saw the block he had few possessions to go and his ability to finish inside You know Miami was going to go to the twoman game Now you see Jay Lucas going to his size Now hes bringing back Hudday wanting more size and protection Well not just today but all season long its been Renu and Donaldson that have closed games in crunch time So no surprise its those two leading the way for the Hurricanes here Lets see what Bongo fouling out now Now youre going to it allows with this small lineup Jay Lucas can protect Malik Renew with his four fouls and youll see him come out if he makes this next free throw Oh misses another one from the free throw line Miami been dreadful in this second half Just five of 11 and that has left the door open for Georgia Tech never knew normally up over 80 from the free throw line as he comes out here with four fouls just one of two from the line there and this isnt a great free throw shooting team for Miami theyre only 68 and Renu is actually 81 and hes only gone one for two the last two trips here Georgia Tech Theyre switching everything manto man Pick your match up and attack Reeves the hot hand Misses it that time Fleming there and hes fouled The guy Fleming in perfect position and hell get two ball goes right into Flemings hands and Shelton Henderson nothing he could do but foul the freshman So its back to a twopossession game with three minutes to play Fleming a chance to cut this lead down to five Both teams are going to their offensive defensive substitution So now Renu is back in the game for U at five Jaden Mustaf back in on the offensive end of the floor and defensively hes going to match up on Renew with those four fouls What was once a 15point lead for Miami is down to five under three minutes to play The Jackets desperate for a defensive stand here Renu with the ball the twoman game with he and Trey Donaldson You switch Renus got the mismatch Hes got the 64 freshman inside Hes got six inches on him Donaldson drives the lane draws the foul He doesnt care when you got that guy Jay Again hes a closer You want to take advantage of him but as a guard no ones playing that position any better than him He crosses over Mustaf there Ray New keeps his seal gives up the angle Nothing they could do but foul him Luckily its not an and one if youre a Georgia Tech fan Donaldson creates separation so effortlessly the blow by there Two big free throws makes the first Count him I think theres ice water in his veins in these moments He just like Ive said before you cant tell them hes not the best player on the floor right now Hes comfortable in these moments Hes closed and won many games Theres not a lot of players in college basketball who has done that such a high level that everywhere hes gone hes hit gamewinners and Jay Lucas knows that Thats why hes going to call every play and leave the ball in his hands Makes them both 22 points 10 assists today And that is his fifth double double with points and assists Tied for the lead nationally with Boopy Miller SMU taking on Duke right now over on ESPN cheering Big possession here for the Jackets Theyve battled back up and under and somehow in for Lamar Washington He is the Georgia Techs version of Trey Donaldson The experienced guard the toughness the closure the closing youre looking for in these moments Great drive and finish there Miami undefeated 130 when leading with two minutes left Big reason why Trey Donaldson has the ball here Shot clock ticks under 10 Run up ball screen with UD And the key is can you rebound it Kick to the corner Allen a three Missed it Battle for the board Henderson somehow gets to the ball Thats the key Shot goes up with this Georgia Tech lineup Can you get the rebound And that time they unable to do so Timeout Jay Lucas and David Statomire screaming at his team How did we knock five Miami has 11 seconds here coming out of the timeout into Donaldson working against Chaz Kelly This is a big possession here Can you close it with a rebound Donaldson the crossover Got it Trey Donaldson So clutch Hes just a dude Theres no other way to say it Fleming the freshman into the paint leaves it off Blue is fouled Hell get two from the line Donaldson a season high 24 points These are the biggest two Yeah hes just Mariano Rivera man in the bottom of the night Im telling you hes just him when it matters Theres not a guard in the country I trust more really than music Trey Donaldson late game to make a play or shot Ive just seen it too many times And that comes from one of the best closing guards in the history of the ACC Rand Hes fun to watch Hes unafraid He knows the ball will be in his hands And again that time we knew it was coming Im playing against Miami Im not letting that guy beat me in the last two or three minutes Well a career day for Donaldson 24 of the last two The biggest of the bunch to go along with 10 assists Blue stop makes the first And if youre Georgia Tech you need this free throw Got to set up some type of fullcourt pressure And this may be the last possession of the game that you play without fouling If you can get a stop this is the guts of the game here Youve got to get a rebound Each team with one timeout one minute to play Miami has led since tip Can they close the final minute here at home I would isolate them again Theyre just all guards on the floor Theyre just going to switch Id leave them oneonone Down the stretch its been all Donaldson this time Passes it off GETS IT BACK WIDE OPEN FOR THREE Good night Trey Donaldson Time out Georgia Tech The Trey Donaldson show has arrived in for the past year and a half because were not through this season that have dealt with more injuries than Georgia Tech did a year ago and missing so many guys here in the first half of this season Donaldson commits the foul there Georgia Tech will go to the free throw line You can live with that if youre Miami with a ninepoint lead Coming up next Georgia taking on South Carolina We get you to the SEC is a busy day Saturday college basketball slate loaded with terrific action Top 25 teams all over the country on our airwaves And Jay you talk about a whats quote unquote a football school that now has a really good basketball team Were talking about the Georgia Bulldogs Its a lot of good basketball being played down there in Athens right now I thought you were talking about Miami Well we talked about Miami laughter And then on the flip side you got Indiana a basketball school thats now got a really really good football laughter team Thats flipped there cheering Thats like a Disney movie The way that football program has flipped in such a short period of time in Indiana uses were talking about Oh coach Greens in studio Hes got to be proud about that Yes Well Georgia Tech has done well from the free throw line 23 of 27 trailing by seven Time not on their side Need to create a turnover here Yeah they foul Renu Hes a 81 free throw shooter Although he has struggled today just four of six from the line They did something there Jay They took the inbounder and then doubled to make sure Trey Donaldson didnt get it I wish they would have done that a few minutes earlier in the half court sets in their defense Miami just shooting eight of 14 from the free throw line this half but an opportunity to close the game here And Renu puts Miami over their average of 88 points per game which leads the ACC They just find ways to score Yeah you know Donaldson and Renu the most consistent pieces of this offense but Hendersons been terrific U dominant in the Alioop game The only thing that holds Miami back is depth Starting five is as strong as there is in college basketball They dont have a ton of depth behind it but theyre passing all the test here early in the season and what youve seen from him defensively and offensively and theyre not beating themselves Reeves 20 seconds left in this game Fleming fires the three Cant hit it So Miami started this game on a 9 nothing run created that early separation ballooned that lead to 228 and Georgia Tech cut it to five twice but couldnt get any closer than that Coming up for the Hurricanes they go on the road at Notre Dame at Clemson They come back home for Florida State at Syracuse and Stanford as they continue to test themselves in the ACC You see Drew Washington come over there and wrap his arms around coach We talked about the culture here and he just has a great ability to coach his guys and hold them to a high standard He doesnt humiliate them and not a lot of coaches can do that So Georgia Tech comeback effort falls just short in this second half And Miami makes it nine straight wins under firstear head coach Jay Lucas Great finish there
