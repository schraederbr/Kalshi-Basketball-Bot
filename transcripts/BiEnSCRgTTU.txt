itll be keev ji for Notre Dame to take the tip the other side will be Titus right and the Broncos win the tip to start the night they d manto man to start with white off to hubard White pulls up from Beyond The Arc there you see an offensive rebound hubard Cashes in exactly that both these two teams strong in offensive rebounds absolutely and if you look at the background of of Western Michigan Coach Stevens coming from where Michigan State and you think about rebounding when you think of Tom ISO teams Burton drives in kicks off taking a look at the starting five for Notre Dame this will be their third lineup combo of the year with Kea ji in it for the third time as well working back from the injury suffered in the preseason yeah you know hes just still getting in game shape right now plus hes wearing a brace on that shooting hand which has got to be a challenge uh for him and youd like to see him be able to be more of a finisher inside uh for Notre Dame here tonight redo the throw in and heres Western Michigan starting lineup this is their fifth time rolling out this combo and something that Coach Stevens talked to us about trying to get consistency from his team we off to great start here really trying to establish you know the inside inside offensive rebound and a drop into the post Roos leading four nothing here early on this Tuesday night asne Nan needs to space the floor so allow some driving and kicking rer tries to drive in as goes to the basket and gets the roll and something that coach yes talked to us about was keeping it simple that is what JR kzn is doing so well for the Irish hes attacking the rim when its open if not hes going to kick it back out if hes open for a three hes going to take it and hes simplified his game I think a lot of players probably wish they could do the same thing the more you can simplify the game the better youre going to be and again the ball attacking the rim getting another high percentage shot for Western Michigan Seth hubber attacking the rim there Burton from Beyond The Arc its the three and thats a really good sign from The Freshman that uh you know its a its a tough gig to be able to do a great job of playing defense at the college level and being able to shoot well from the threepoint line off singer brings out to the top of the key Taylor Cruz monegro white goes driving in makes contact thats just been the uh chemistry so far for Western Michigan is getting the ball inside and attacking the basket great start for Western Davis sees the lane gets fouled count it wow that is a great way to attack the basket there again those are the things that he has been doing so well the last three games for the IR 25 Davis 27 points over the last two games transferred in from seen Hall Once Again part of this young roster for this Irish team and something that coach mentioned starting to get their legs under them a little bit Yeah they really are you know the thing that the Irish have done very well is defended very well and the offense will come along in time but it takes a little bit more time the timing of the players the development of their skills it takes more time than just playing hard defensively M Dame only averaging 619 points per game so far in the young season hubber from the Baseline flies it over rer is there great defensive effort on a double team on the Baseline Davis to the basket and lays it in hes taking off just where he left off the last last game hes attacking the basket more not just settling and hes so athletic and long he can do a lot of damage when he gets to the rim right with the HW rattles around what a job from Titus right yeah he has been really tough here in the beginning getting the ball exactly where he wants and it sure shows that hes got a great touch on that jump hook play rates been in 50 from the field in every game except the first game versus North Dakota State yeah hes and you know you look at what makes you a successful player attacking the basket and again heres a Baseline Drive using his body and using his length and then putting up soft with his left Music hand now called against right nice Cut goes in and gets fouled again the message has been really clear you know attack the baskets good things happen and Davis has got that message Im going hard to the rim tonight and you know when you do that as a player youre going to get your team at the free throw line and uh you know the more you get to the free throw line the better your teams going to be and youre going to create foul trouble they was able to make the first coach Mah shury in his first first year here inside pcel Pavilion brings a lot of experience over from both the NBA ranks and in the Collegiate yeah and I asked him today grade your team and I said I know one thing coach youre a hard grader and so you know he gave him a grade I gave him a grade I think we finally negotiated that uh the grades a lot better than the coach wanted theyre theyre playing very solid advocate for the student athletes over there coach yes I am now that Im not coach anymore Im going to give them the the break finals coming up for both these two schools theyll have finals next week slow up a little bit only having one game between the two of them right flies one over hits Rim goes out of bounds take us to our first media break Notre Dame leading by one and mewest Showdown here on this Tuesday night the Helm of the Broncos but really grew in the ranks at Michigan State 19 years 19 years at Michigan State and you know you have to say well why would you leave but I think I think every coach thats an assistant finds himself in a situation whats next you know I think that Western Michigan you keep your eye on that thats a program that he fell in love with meeting with the ad and they got a steal when they got this guy to come to uh kalamazo Michigan told us it was a love story as soon as he met his and knew this was the place for Applause him going right inside isolating Davis Davis trying to go up yeah cant finish white trying to push the pace up to hubard from Beyond The Arc shb loses it but Davis bu Beast out of bounds you know theyre just always around the basket the shot goes just see a lot of Brown jerseys getting to the rim and that you youve got to go back as a player and keep contact with your opponent before you go to the off or the defensive glass hubard fake from the inbound off the iron burn will bring it up set the offense good spacing by the Irish going allow the drive drives in kicks out Shrewsberry for three you know as a as a point guard Burtons been asked to score a lot early but now you can see him becoming a complete player by finding the open Man attacking the basket kicking out and getting his teammates open thats what you want a point guard to do coach shury talked about it to us earlier today at shootaround where you opened it up where he started with 29 Points with the Freshman record but then has somewhat quiet at his scoring but understanding hes becoming more of a traditional point guard dishing it out yes and hes taking care of the basketball and he understanding his role and you know the game will come to him as time time allows shuberry for another three he knocks it down wow thats a great start for the Freshman to come in here off the bench and knock in two big threo shots its a big three you know if youre point guard you got to be able to do a lot of different things and heres a great drive to the hole and then finding that man the opposite wing and you know a classmate they know each other and he made a perfect pass looking all the way for a kick out for a three thats just being a complete point guard right there in the air coach getting it done as well yeah and then here again just keeps the ball alive finds his teammate again another three and I think that all starts with a mentality that Im going to distribute the ball just not think about going to the rim Burton coming in at averaging 35 assists per game one of the top on this Irish team start to pick it up like weve talked about and seeing his role more as a distributor rather than a score and the Irish have been looking for more production at the offensive end and you know I think thats been the focus here the last two weeks by the coaching staff loose and it comes down with it B singer again another offensive rebound that uh you know Western Michigans going to look to take advantage of every opportunity they look at a Miss as the pasture themselves its amazing how they go to the glass and then to call for booth to come over set the screen yeah itll be an offensive foul called against Carrie booth the lob singer getting it done yeah Beyond The Arc yeah you want to keep the ball alive get the offensive rebound here then be able to kick it to the Baseline you know thats the shot thats uh youre going to play horse on that one hes going to knock that in a lot got another one lob singer feeling hot has it roll around Booth cant come down with it rer is there Applause though booth rer jberry tries to track it down go the Broncos way both teams using a lot of bench play so far which uh you know you can see as you look at their stats theyre playing a lot more people going eight deep on both sides uh here in the first Music half so far Notre Dame only ones able to re benefits from the bench as they have six bench points to Broncos none and that uh isnt that freshman number 11 there shuberry that hit two big Music threes W is back in lets see if they go back inside to him Andro has driving in loose Imes comes down with it picks it up pass it off to ji from the Baseline spinning a 3 second call against Roper got stuck in the wrong position for people that havent watched or paid much attention to Western Michigan this is a team that went up to Chicago and lost by four yeah lost by four 20 21 plus turnovers and they only got beat by and we we know what Northwestern did with Purdue last week so this team has a lot of people that can Music play fou called against julan Rober his first itll be two free throws to come and Russell Michigan lost 6359 back on November 14th that was a game that Kurt Stevens felt like add stuff moving in the right direction and they go to the Emerald Coast Classic they show a lot of signs of it then somewhat fell apart against St Thomas on Friday and wants to try and get it back today and you know a lot of times as a coach youre dealing with other things and one of the things theyre dealing with is injuries and you know you lose your point guard uh the the motor of your team and all of a sudden youre trying to have other people step up and that takes time to to get that changed Davis comes down with a rebound BR M to and this is the other thing that Davis can do for his team he can be at the point a large big point guard that gives them another playmaker on the perimeter try on the top of the key it off to IMS might have to get a shot up here one second left on the shot clock Davis trying to drive in but a shot clock violation Broncos bench happy with it Notre Dame leading by three Western Michigan keeping it tight here on this Tuesday night its a young team it really is you know you got Four Freshman out there most of the time and people dont realize that what that means you know you got transfers you got freshman you got WalkOns you got a whole mixture of people that youre trying to learn their names and so its going to take time for those young people to learn the game and to focus on what it takes to play at the college level at a high power five School talk about that focus on that shot clock violation to get us into the media break coach focus is a skill set just like dribbling or shooting you got to be focused on what youre doing out on the floor what the what the scy P says will slow it down Davis on the top of the wing as all the way to the corner thought about a three I just looking inside they really dont have anything again theyre down on the shot clock famis spin move brings it to the basket and that was close but a great awareness of the shot clock anointment he had to get to the rim I am impressed though with Wester Michigan going to the glass but you know as as you recognize the situation you got to have somebody on the floor who going to say okay times running out I got to get to the rim and heres a great example of getting to the rim getting a bucket to your team when when they definately need a a score in a possession Davis brings in some experience transferred in from seen hole Aver 134 minutes a game of last year for the Pirates hes got a lot of skill he can get places and finish and right there is a great a great interior pass that he can make hes really a power point man in many ways Music send got a giant to the line to shoot two after the personal foul mares strickling itll be his first and its good for the Irish to have a big back you know the rotations are so much different now where you can rotate three bigs and uh you know they missed his presence early in the year and hes going to keep getting better too you know its a its a process and hes going to continue to as he logs more minutes and gets more touches hes going to feel a lot more comfortable around the rim the only player to come with Coach Shrewsberry from Penn State having played for shuberry last year transfer from PSU Agro to right Music outside the paint trying to back in ji tries to go up strong off the IR loose ball Applause underneath whistle will come its out of bounds and will go Notre Dames way no one could really tie it up to force a jump ball saw the fight there and its a fight for every rebound it it is and Ive been really watching what western Michigan does they do an amazing job of getting position before the shot goes up their weak side board people are getting bodies on people and so thats a a secret if you want to get become a very good rebounder you got to get positioned before your teammate takes a shot got to find the other player make sure you feel out box out thats exactly right and they play physical right they have both these two teams stacking up pretty evenly back at the top three in their conference and offensive rebounds while Notre name seventh in the ACC and defensive rebounds proves to be a great fight who can win the battle on the boards and who can make more the most threes its going to be a game Davis kicks out rer thought about it one second rattles around but foul will be called off ball wow Im surprised that could have went either way but again the presence of minder knowing whats on the shot clock youve got to be able to recognize that earlier and get a quality shot not of Hill marry foul called against Kev ji his first other names third of this first half white P cavis comes out with the rebound and this is a playmaker as a power point guard as I talked before that can really break people down and esne from Beyond The Arc gets fouled will shoot three there be a foul on number three for the Broncos team the artist white is second and you know the thing about it hes just playing hard uh Jr kesti hes learned his role extremely well and hes been patient here at Notre Dame he was a red shirt uh as a sophomore but now you can just tell the game has slowed down and he understands his role bars white missed all of last year and has started to work himself back into this lineup trying to be a key contributor and for him someone that coach really looks to yes a career high eight field goals to net 20 points in the season opener so started after missing the entire season off with a bang and really starting to find his feet again wa adds length through a program you know as a wing at 67 he can he can get off threes like you just saw there but he also has the ability to get it through the rim and finish as Music second box set here by Western Music Applause Michigan Applause Hanah from Beyond the Y dashes three and thats great defense I mean thats great defense and better offense and sometimes you know as a coach you you got to just you know move on to the next play cuz that was very solid at both both ways offensively and defensively Martin sees an opening goes under with for the layup got another gear he just got a godgiven another gear that a lot of people do not see or recognize until you get on the floor taking a look back on this Javon Hannah three yeah I mean heres just a great look hand in the face you know got all those things and then again the Mr creator that can get past people start on the left side finishes on the right side thats pretty special and hard to do both sides showing off Music here this Midwest rivalry Game whistle will come another foul will be called against another C foul call against Carrie boo his third already here in this game wow Applause down finally comes Hannah pulls up contested again this time another offensive rebound for the Broncos H looking to fly it over Sona picks it ball fake great ball fake midrange jumper pump fake Coach yep I love it you know as a coach you just teach it teach it teach it a ball fake will set you up for you know one step and a nice pullup jump shot and thats missing in the game and I think that that ball fake will set up a lot of good things for those young people out here watching this game ball fake practice it make that fake look like a shot AR out to hubard hubard floats it to the rack cant get it boo it down with the rebound know they looking to push it Barry has it tipped away goes out of bounds go the other way great its Shrewsberry shuberry staying hot tonight leading the team with eight points and its this midrange jumper off the M State calling himself almost the mid major Michigan State well thats who you are thats who hes been you think about hes been right beside sitting beside Tom ISO for 19 years so whats going to happen they want run transition thats Michigan state theyre going to go on the boards weve seen that and theyre going to defend so those are the things that this teams going to continue to get better at as he builds this program a travel called and you know you know you think about Coach shur hes saying the same thing were going to build this from the bottom up were going to build this team by defending first finding G it playing mentally tough and the rest of its going to come into place as we grow and Music develops off the screen see Carri Booth wide open in the corner Carrie Booth again thats a great find in the dead corner and Booth uh has that great stroke from behind the behind the threepoint Applause line Hanah back off to Music hubard trying to drive in sees nothing zonas all over it Burton tips it away you know again weve talked about a point guard be able to do different things but again here he goes all the way across the opposite side of the floor you know those are just a great vision hes hes looking up hes finding open people and the results are open three burn picked up his third assist of the night so far on that one uth will take a seat Strickland trying to get by rer again theyre on the GL open Davis sets it down you know when you attack the glasses as Western Michigan does so well it does open up transition easy baskets and that was a great example there where everybody was hard on the glass no one was back and got easy transition basket just bash on the other side of monegro great pull up and hes had a really solid year so far for the Music Broncos called him a natural leader for this team and you got even though hes Young and the teams young you got to have leaders on the FL at all times only a sophomore too which she emulat just has that natural leadership Tendencies yes Mai to go off the Music iron I think a really critical spot here for the Broncos you got five minutes to go and see how you can create some offense gets fouled and well go to the line thats how you create offense coach yeah it is coming up there with his left hand knock it in with his left hand you know again just made a really good strong move over the extension of the defense again off the glass with the left hand just a nice look and we weve talked about Davis I I think we have think we have but I think you need to talk about the exclamation mark yeah I think he he can wear out of the rim real quick but you know he can get up off the floor quick its not how high a person jumps its how quick they get off the floor Davis has got that additional Sprint that he can get off the floor and get to the room so quick a little bit of Court maintenance got after a little bit of blood got on the court both coaches using it little time out timeout here shry already breaking out the white board drawing up the play hes going to use every minute he has you know as a coach thats what you want to do you this is a freebie so hes going to go through uh what theyre going to look at for their next set you know I know they got one free throw here by the Broncos and then uh heres what were going to run with this group of really really almost four guards in the lineup ja was called on the foul now Burton back to the line to finally shoot it he makes it and that was a big possession for Western Michigan to get that threepoint play uh and not uh get past 10 points here in the first Music half on back off to IMS shuberry for three cant get it negro comes down with the rebound gr down to Bur Burton Burton trying and post up Zona good close out by the Irish Bon deep Music transition the Irish really need to continue to work on their spacing and their half court offense thats going to open up opportunities to get to the rim or knock in threes ims in the corner 7even seconds left on the shot clock oer got Happy Feet and called for the travel bring us to the final media timeout of this first half Notre Dame leading by 10 but Western Michigan starting to pick it up for Coach Shrewsberry first Mr Indie Indiana basketball for in a long time third in Notre Dame history yes you know to get a kid thats uh committed to the school no matter whos the coach says a lot about Marcus Bert as a person and uh he is a great find and he has really to me excelled so far coming in here as a freshman point guard being missed the basketball and thats thats the additional pressure and hes handled all every bit of it but then also you have to add on the pressure of playing in your backyard a miss m a WKA guy yeah and stays to play in South for his college career after growing up watching Notre Dame you have to thats got to add a little bit more pressure as well it is you cant go anywhere you cant go to the mall without somebody saying hey thats Marcus Burton you know and uh all his friends you know went tickets and all those things that come with being a home Hometown kid Shrewsberry starting to become a HomeTown kid here tonight another deep three 11 points for the Freshman yeah hes had a really good I think he feels more comfortable right now coming off the bench and I think as a coachs son sometimes as a freshman its challenging everybody knows that your dads the coach but be able to come off the bench watch a little bit and then move from there is usually a good sign now I know why hes such a great percentage shooter cuz he gets to the rim so well Titus right big pick up there for the Broncos air ball comes from Jr yeah you know if you can get the ball inside to a big and their physical look at that nice touch nothing but net and again uh the bench having somebody come off the bench and get some offense and thats exactly what you want from their freshman guard coming in and knocking down some open looks and having a really solid first half Hannah takes the contact lays it in here as a coach you want to finish strong and if youre Western initially again youre thinking hey lets cut into this lead and get it down to five before a half Davis stuck Music underneath 10 seconds down on the shot clock as he sees an opening got to put it up three seconds left open cant get it loose and finally brought down and up to Hannah driving in with hover theres no quit in the Broncos and you can tell that toughness you know 3 minutes ago they could have been down 15 and now they continue to pursue continue to defend continue to good do things and uh again thats part of the culture that Coach Stevens wants to great here at Western Music Michigan goes to the line only a 66 free throw shooter misses the first there yeah isnt it amazing how it always baffled me as a coach when he had somebody could step out and shoot threes and knock them in and go to the free throw line and struggle but te hubard for example averaging 157 points per game which is 10th in the ma and hes getting it done from Beyond The Arc has a 37 and a half percentage from Beyond the three but yet at the free throw line just around 66 and theres that Focus word again Im convinced that its a focus thing its a confidence thing its going through routine and making sure that you use the same same mental focus from from that 15t line great offensive rebound Big Board turns to Big points yes easiest way to score in basketball is offensive rebounds right hooks it and another one high percentage shots TI right yeah he got that great touch around the basket great sides thought about it deep Burton mes it to Hannah actual contact though yeah to get a cheap foul here and I think hes a little frustrated cuz he got fouled BT got fouled on the drive no call now youre going to now youre going to put something fre throw line Titus right though in the pain yes he he loves the paint doesnt he I mean this big guy can finish and using the glass going to his left shoulder and using the glasses its pretty special in The Point Blank Range for him and the bonus as Monro misses now under a minute left in this first first half key possession here boo thought about it Burton loses it andah picks it up off the floor Monro driving in count it talked about the importance of finishing strong at the half I think the last two minutes of every half is critical and you have seen the Broncos respond in a huge each way time out on the floor take a look this is just transition basketball this is that Michigan State thumpr yeah and they it feeds off of things that coaches hate to see turnovers its very hard to defend turnovers you know you could defend a lot of things a lot of sets but you you go back to back turnovers and now youre giving the opponents a chance to get down the floor quickly looking for those things that resemble Michigan State and that thats exactly uh the formula that Western um Michigan wants to have throughout this game and for this Western Michigan team they got a little bit across the board they got three guys on their roster with Canadian TI absolutely they just dont play hockey up there theyve got theyve got basketball and theyve got very good basketball and you see here that uh these three kids have moved South but they didnt have to go to the warm weather they just went to you know Michigan so they can still get used to the cold weather and play Hoops nro those stars from the north for this Broncos Applause team will make it cutting into that lead here coach you know 10 or 12 and now its back to five thats exactly what we talked about early if you can get it down to five youre feeling really good going into the half and second difference between shock and game clock booth has a rattle around cant have it come down I and hold for last shot yeah theyre going to take the last shot here what a big possession here could cut it down to you know a one possession game basically with a three or or a bucket a foul and Coach shy not happy with it be call against Marcus in his third yeah thats thats uh again these are things again we talked about with a young team Focus youve got to stay focused when youre up 10 thats the time that you want to try to put somebody away on your home floor and uh because of the lack of focus theres been turnovers bad shots and uh the Broncos have taken advantage of all Applause Music that the first B here make this second one theyre going to go right into a transition look here for Dame to get a quick shot up here with uh less than 8 Applause seconds buron brings it to cough has court buron Roper now with time expiring count it two in rer sends one home and hits a dagger get the Irish heading into the locker room leading Burton starts it off with the Irish a Sixpoint lead starting this second half tries to force it down low to J rles around and finds its hands into the Broncos ball was up high catchable pass but just wasnt quite ready for another turnover by another Applause day Agro on the right Agro underneath T of force it back up but Titus right is there again you can just see the ability that get to the offensive boards and you know this has been a key factor the whole game and thats exactly what western Michigan wants to do play the Irish really physical Inside by down low up against right tries to do rights own hook move Barne with a heads up high IQ Music play quick conversation being had by the officials is he inbound still appears to be coach yeah I I think they got it right you know again those are things Jr just ping around and uh you just got to give your team an extra possession and you never know that extra possession could be the difference in the Music game upper inbounds to bur reset here with 15 on shot Music clock shot clock violation in the first half for the Irish foul called righted IQ coach with the KCK yeah its really been a struggle here other than the threepoint line its been a really struggle cuz the Irish have other than you know getting the ball to Davis they have not been able to establish the paint uh very well at all yis Whites third foul hell take a seat now a foul on the other side another foul poan Western ising in this time and Oren lobsinger his first of the day one of the few that has touched the floor for this team and then another foul is going to come and its going to be tightest right this time again uh just simple things and making sure that youre not using your hips and your knees on these ball screens or screens away from the basket got a good look Music Applause herey for the three Davis comes down with the rebound Burton trying to Drive in Stutter Steps get fouled again being able to have presence of mind that as he drove the basket there he he didnt have any room to put it up with his right hand so he had to create something a little different switched over to the left hand drew the foul just a really heads up play by The Freshman guard and exactly freshman guard is the key word I want to emphasize here being a Freshman in making plays like that thats why as Indiana Mr basketball player you know hes grown up playing with really good people people against really good people and you know his size has created a situation where you have to be a creative scorer and thats what hes done in his career makes second after missing the first I Western Michigan what are you saying here to try and get your team rolling here in the second half yeah I think again to start off youve got to get the ball back inside where you were before so you got to post up right like right here again he is just a load inside and the Irish really dont have an answer for him at Music all and now Carrie boo picks up his fourth foul of the day that means hell go to the bench Matt Zona will be in so you can see again as a coaching staff now youre going to be talking a lot about getting it into that big number 22 and giving him opportunities to post up big and get easy looks inside theres another foul but now will become an on boots replacement Sona yes and you know theres again you that was displacement used by by number 25 Zona from nor Dame just got to play heads up you got to get good angles then you just got to play solid defense double Monro cant hit the three now thats the the poison you got to pick I think they made a wise decision by doubling right making sure the and give it up now you got to really scramble out there and defend the Applause three bounce passes it to buron rer its the nylon on it again thats set up by the Pressman guard attacking the Gap finding the man open allowing him to knock open that three point shot what a pure shot from rer yes got a big one right before half as well but we need to make sure we dont forget mismatch inside into the lane tries to float it into the basket loose ball still loose Roper trying to go coast to coast and it finishes with the slam effort absolute effort there by the veteran guard another key situation here are you going to be able to get the ball back inside get a good look see if the Irish will double again H all over him and then a miscommunication Burton will try and go all the way hits the spin underneath has it blocked but a foul call a big three from Julian Ro yeah heres a great kick out right there you know coach shb right away recognizes his freshman guard and then just effort effort effort effort coach CH says we dont want a coach effort its got to be there every game theres a great example just a net play gets you an easy bucket oper transferring in from Northwestern I mean you you know that the thing that a lot of young people dont realize you can have so many skills but coaches dont have to make you play hard thats on you and so youve got to play hard every night every practice thats the only way you deserve time on the Flor GI comes back on to the floor Notre Dame again they took that substitution match up when Wright comes out then they have the flexibility to to rotate in another big and key minutes here another major turnover over P tried to force the pass a little too much yeah they tried to seal inside but uh you know just was a pass that was way over the top only the Broncos fifth turnover so far today though yeah like coach Steven said he wanted to try and slow down but T Davis trying to pick back up the speed again brings it in cast the points time out from Dwayne St bench and it really goes to sh 687 points per game at home and then on the road it falls to 568 and I think theres a a reason why I think when you got a young team theres two things that happen one youre playing on the road against really good people and youre playing on the road those two things happen and for for especially a young team youre in a different routine youre traveling you got to get down to Miami you got to get back you got South Carolina youre going all over the place and thats a different routine when you get home this is where you practice every day and so youre going to have better better luck and again maybe a little different quality of Team here early in the season but you even he hasnt unpacked his back yet no he hasnt from New York yeah from New York New York exactly these guys have been on the road goes in and gets the basket and thats a good situation coming out of a timeout going in a set getting a good look and uh young man really attacked the basket well and finished and uh hes the one I want to see shoot free throws yet this this uh game because hes really struggled from the line yeah Crump 87 from the three throw line two for 23 on the season Tai trying to back it in rer is there though for the putback what a really strong guard and the opportunities that that gives him to get to the offensive glass now with 12 points for the Fighting Irish being a little more methodical in their Music offense white Reb great rebound nor Dame is forcing western western Michigan to really look at pull up jump shots rather than threes or post ups and thats thats exactly what the defense is set up for for Dame keep them away from the three Burton for three here we go Marcus Burton with a big three great challenge now and the Broncos have to come back and get in an offensive look pretty been pretty stagnant in a 41 look here not been able to get anything going inside they to let crumb take the shot goes out of bounds Notre Dame on a 152 scoring run over the last 4 minutes and 15 seconds theyre finding their shot here in purcel the tight tonight has been one of those where he is knocked down free hes been able to attack the rim and then get offensive rebounds so hes a veteran hes a strong player hes been around hes played in the Big 10 and you got to be able to count on him to lead this team because everybody else its all new and he has been through it all tied for the team lead with 12 points with Tay Davis sberry back on to the court for the Irish B swings it off Shrewsberry great ball F tried to go underneath loose ball and joh gets fouled again I cant emphasize enough uh you again the coach me the ball fake the pump fake and and you know you see that in shb where hes a coachs kid that just has a great feel of when to fake and get to the rim when to not fake and take the shot and thats uh thats a great skill set I cant make first came into today with 833 from the free throw line a second big possession here for Western Michigan coach well I I think theyre at the point now that theyve got to get on a run here theyve got to be able to knock down some threes get back in this game uh and they also have got to get some type of inside presence and they cant just rely on getting offensive rebounds there you go big response there yes and thats a that was a great offense you said they stayed spread out they take took care of the ball they get the ball exactly where they wanted and got a point blank shot Davis its off to rer bur sees an opening on the Baseline tries to get it to ji ji being strong but loses it trying to go up Crum all the way to the basket Anthony Crum what a play right again very athletic very strong very physical very long so he was able to get up and over the defender and get an easy look Trump led the team with 12 points back on Friday versus St Thomas Davis tried to send it down has it rejected by the room yeah that was a little he needed one more dribble transition iron Davis trying to make up for goes for the layup this time you got like his game being able to put the ball on the floor like he can cover so much space and get to the rim uh he is a special athlete for the Music Irish white midrange jumper again if youre going to give up something you dont want to get the roll you dont want to give up the three so again he did a great job of using a pull up and its a you know a shot that the analytics say is a tough shot for for anyone to make in college basketball today Burton off to Davis look whos coming after though on the transition here white came down with the rebound passes it off to Music HUB Agro Burton trying to drive in onehanded Davis down with the rebound another good re rebound having what a what a game being able to be a rebound and defend and then be able to uh get to the rim those are the things that the Irish man need to get a better Point production as they get closer and closer to just the grind of the ACC turn uh you know regular conference play youve got to be able to score in the ACC so some basketball hover tries to go up for it gets fouled along the way D Davis having himself a day at a career night on Saturday starting to pick up the pace here heroing how you defend this young man because he has just been on the boards you know hes what six for seven from the field hes one of the best field goal percent Shooters in the back and uh this next 11 minutes they need to get him a lot of touches hubber makes the first free throw this is the spot again as a coach you want to see your young team develop and recognize either if youre down by 12 or up by 12 to be able to figure it out and be able to get great possessions here and either extend the lead if youre not aame or cash in and getting this game back underneath 10 points so uh these next four or five minutes are very very important for both teams as theyre young and theyre still trying to figure out how to win games HS to Shrewsberry the top of the key hands it off to IMS 3 seconds left on the shot clock two seconds Booth with the fadeaway three off the iron Zona stepped out of bounds go Broncos way yeah heres Heres the the the question I I ask everybody as a as a coach when when your point guards not in a game whos going to create offense as you know I think thats been uh the the Davis and the Burton not being on the floor who is going to create offense whos creating offense for the Broncos is Titus right right there what a great game I mean he has just played solid solid at both ends of the floor critical time I really believe this for another aame to find whos going to be able to score here until we get to the 8 Minute Mark for the Irish the only starter on the floor is JR KES who tried to drive in there and now hes going to be able to get to the free throw line which again is another great opportunity to score you dont always have to put the points in by the by the paint or the threepoint line get to the free throw line thats something that n Dame has struggled with all year is creating points from the line not coming in was 330th in free throw attempts averaging 144 free throw attempts per game yeah and and NCA Division 1 schools is 351 youre near the bottom of the ranks got to get to the line those are free points yes it is and you know that theres two issues there thats very obvious and the nor Dame staff could tell you well we dont really have a post presence where we got a big man that were going to get the ball to thats going to create foul situations and the other thing is that uh theyve got threepoint Shooters and so theyre not just going to be constantly attacking the basket on the dribble Jr makes the first but yeah youve got to be able to create that because theres going to be lulls in the game where you have to get to the free throw line and knock in shots and uh you know as you get into conference play everybodys going to know everything you do and so being able to create get to the line and get easy back baset is going to help the production of of the Irish and they need that offensive production cuz theyre playing solid at the defensive end lane violation on Titus right results in a redo of the free throw here for JR kzn I used to do that in the backyard if it missed a free throw I always have somebody in the lane violation to get an extra free throw you know I dont know if anybody else in the backyard used to do that but I did and I missed a lot of shots but there was a lot of dumb Lane violations by the the missing person wow that is a great pullup shot again he has hit two of those as uh hes coming off that screen that is hard to hit that shot HS to Shrewsberry now down to ji kesn contested three transition quickly pushing is white he pulls out passes to hubard boo down with the rebound that was a a good look and uh fortunate if youre Notre name that didnt ball go in your best threepoint shooter had a perfect look Booth hands it off to Shrewsberry that called back for Imes and Irish struggling Booth from Deep off the front of the iron migs got it back within 10 yeah and here they go if they get a bucket here this is anybodys game again and so they have fought their themselves right back into the game big three right cant come down with the rebound HS doges for the Irish see a lane stuck underneath Western michigans had two great Music looks its fouled yeah I really like that possession you know not selling for free Bo puts the ball on the floor and hes got that athletic ability where he didnt settle he his early career he settled but here he puts it on the floor gets it up there nice and soft with the right hand draws some foul and uh again heres what were talking about get to the free throw line for these easy baskets who shootting 61 from the charity stripe cant make to and one her name leading by 12 M brings it across midcourt see if they get the ball into right here hubard for three and its a big three yes for this Broncos team theres a shooter for you he had a wide open look two possessions going missed it came right back at had no fear did not think about missing and hit another big shot so uh the Irish are going to have to really know where he is at all times stepped out of bounds go the other way but itll be a timeout from coach Shrewsberry Western Michigan making a push theyre within single digits of the Irish youre looking for as a coach youre looking for balance so you just dont have one or two players having responsibilities score and uh you know the the scoring has been a challenge for Notre Dame and its going to continue to be that way but when you get more balance with more people involved you know youre going your point production is going to go up and its its gradually went up today because youve had great balance by a lot of different people inside to right here got it its going to go all the way into the corner to offinger but hell step out of bounds and thats an un first turnover they you just really cant afford it through the Broncos at this time that drives coaches nuts because that line has not moved in 100 years the side out of bounds line and you see veteran players step out of bounds and they think wait a minute where you practice with that line there is there all the time weve had two situations in this game where people stepped on the sidelines uh and its just you think what it doesnt move giant underneath into the paint in move hits it thats a great post up there faked over one shoulder then went right back to his left shoulder and he had his balance there and uh no answer by the Music Broncos right cant convert few times heard that tonight Titus right I get right into your offensive here got to get moving dont want to let this shot clock Get down under 10 Davis off to PNE foul will be called against hubard guys post up yeah you know wanting the basketball is so important as a big you know if you dont want the ball bigs youre not going to get it so you got to be what I call Hungry receiver demand the ball get your hand hand up there fight off with one hand call with the other be a hungry receiver get the ball and look for opportunities to score thats Again by attacking the basket there the Irish were able to get to the free throw line and if you look at this game uh from this point on its going to be two free throws and thats huge for the last you know 6 and a half minutes of Music play makes them both yep and the Broncos with white has their point guard looking to try and make something happen but a foul called against Music Shrewsberry shs first all the teams fourth yeah so again theyre in great situation the Irish but Im looking here for Wright or hob to create a great opportunity to get a bucket or that guy now pulled up and hit three tough pup midrange jump shots white hits it there off the big screen by right on the top of the key has want the ball to stick you got to keep the ball moving another great take Davis trying to go in transition basketball is it too far for lobsinger Keeps it inbounds kesi picks it up Irish on the transition here find a threepoint shooter opper to the corner sherberry hits the rim and it sends it home thats a Shooters touch there that just nestled in but again that was a great situation where he had easy bucket potential One Way coming back the other way getting a three another turnover theres ball no whistle Roper sets it down we need a timeout will be a timeout from coach Dwayne Stevens it was a lot happening it was transition ultimately went it up Western Michigan cant convert B singer keeping it in bounds and here we go just looking for the open player and the shooter has got to find a place and there he is its Shrewsberry knocking it down you know I look at that play Replay of that I think the Irish got a break they they Ste on the found on the saving the ball should been dead for the Irish underneath the basket but Im sure theyll take it because uh that ended up with being a great situation with another turnover and then this has been his second opportunity to finish with a dunp and uh the Irish have been able to expand this lead in the last three possessions again taking care of the basketball hitting your free throws playing solid defense has been the the really the chemistry that has worked really well for the other days here in their last five minutes see it there for the Irish four four of their last field goals again youre looking at what not Dame has done very very well all year and theyve defended well and you know youre sitting here with 55 points if youre Western Michigan and thats thats just really solid team defense hbert hits nylon for a big three Music Davis will bring it across half court for the Irish Davis back to the top of the key drives in kicks off Shrewsberry driving in again going right to the basket greaten Shrewsberry its a great take when your threepoint shooter attacks the rim like that and gets it easy basket it makes it so much harder for the defense singer nne comes down with a rebound for the Irish shuberry pulls up for three cant get it ja is there body is falling everywhere and a foul finally comes yeah yeah you know again if youre a threepoint shooter just dont be one dimensional again heres just a great example where he sees an open Lane and goes straight to the rim and gets a good easy shot and uh thats just going to compliment as more and more people do scouting said he has the ability to break the defense down and go to the rim so you got to play him honest the first moving his night to three for five from free throw line yeah and hes consistently a solid free throw shooter and I think thats so important for a big thats going to get fouled you got to be able to get to the line and make the free throws makes the second right hands it off to H Hanah to HUB got lock in on HUB if youre defense for the Irish get double team pulls up to contested and the trio of Irish knock it out of bounds it will stay Broncos way you got to live with that though as your coach you got three players fighting for the off or defensive rebound uh the ball just goes out of bounds but you know thats just an effort issue and you got to live with that but dont know its your own team coach H yeah yeah thats you got to be saying its my ball my ball my ball you dont want to have all three of them again heres a a great example where the Irish going to be really strong at the defensive end and you know the thing that you want to do as we get to this break is is keep them off the free throw line D call for the foul that sends us to our media timeout what can Western Michigan cook up in the media timeout they make they got to take off Marquette and they got to double that with Georgetown some Big East games to start and then favor it off with Citadel Maris and then you open up conference play on a more regular basis with uba yeah you know I I look at the next game up and you you got to think as a coach youre going against Marette who a team thats one of the top teams really in the country Dr Smarts done an incredible job of building that program thats going to be a great challenge for the young Irish Music Team B the Crump B around cant go hand with the hook back effort and pull court pressure here no theyre backing up 15 points the Broncos are to the Irish under four minutes left to play Davis strong to the basket hes had just an outstanding game and you know I think the Irish are finding that how can you play without Marcus B in the game and uh theyve responded here a response from beardis White for three he has had a really strong second half shooting the basketball and defending and uh theres going to be good things for him down the road for sure Davis gets fouled going to the basket yeah and again he knows he can get to the rim and his Defender knows he can get to the rim so that makes it really really tough but you know the thing that when you look at Western Michigan were going to talk about they love to get to the offensive boards its just a one to situation there where a shot goes and if you dont get a body on the jerseys of the Broncos theyre going to get it theyre going to find a way to get offensive cant make the Music first now right back on to the floor seems to always be going well for the Broncos when rght is on the floor Music yeah fundamentally sound basket yeah I I just really think if uh in the future you got to be looking for right to be uh playing more minutes of all possible uh and again he has really been a load inside throughout the entire game and uh you know he shows why is a high percentage player because he gets to the rim all the time Stay Western Michigans way after went off the foot ke a dve again this isnt just mopup time theres lots of time here for both teams to get better and so you dont want to see this last two minutes become sloppy of either end trying to turn the corner unsuccessful with Davis once again coming down with him I cant say enough about Davis tonight he has just been so solid and playing with so much confidence that Notre Dame really needs from him at the rebounding end and and the also offensive end because he can he can put points on the board and he has done a great job tonight doing CL things Davis is one rebound away from a double double 17 points so far nine rebounds he just has a dimension that the Irish really need a big player in his position that can play small forward or big guard Hanna puts up a three but foul called two teams attempted for the rebound J will be called on his fourth Marcus Burton comes back on the floor has four fouls himself Music self there we go number three tonight uh where weve had a player step on a side out of bounds so uh that line has not moved yet it still has not moved but uh uh some film coach somebody can explain that to me but that that just drives coaches nuts like that line is not moving weve had three times you dont see NBA players stepping on line very much Burton with a strong finish yes again thats just his game hes got incredible body control right kicks it off Davis up to Burton will get fouled great job by Marcus Burton to draw the foul Yes again he just has that Knack that feeling he recognize that hes in a position where the defender is off off his feet so just little pum fake and lets him jump into him and now he has a chance to get to the free throw line hes so crafty and Beyond his years really has a freshman hes been his years and understanding knowing the game and you know I give his high school coach coach Al roach whos a Hall of Fame coach High School coach in the state of Indiana that has worked with him and developed him and allowed his his basketball IQ to get better taking a look at who the Broncos have coming up here in their near future got a big one against Youngstown State back home in cazoo and start picking up action play yeah theres yeah the same situation that now it gets real serious once you get done with finals boy now it gets into serious conference play for both these teams and uh that separate separates you know the good from the great Im say cant make the three think he took that rebound away from Davis or hed have that triple double dont worry Davis made the rebound on the transition got the triple double tonight 1710 and hes going to get a bucket here Strong finish 19 points now for Trey Davis and again great entry pass by bur who was just seeing the floor very very well tonight for another day asne comes down with a rebound looks like both teams will just let the clock play out here yeah I think that when we uh grade out the Irish I think coach shury is going to give a better grade and we talked about so far I think tonight hes found his team grow up a lot theyve done those things that hes asked him to do they put points on the board and theyve defended very very well so hats off to the Irish and the coaching staff Notre Dame Maron hits the midrange firing in all cylinders tonight offensively quickly for the basket Monro going to walk this one out the Irish got to feel very good about coming back and getting a a win after tough tough road games uh the last two two games on the road Irish WI 8665 in a Midwest Showdown
