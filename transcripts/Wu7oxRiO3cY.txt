11 power five teams in their nonconference over the last two years So uh they are certainly not afraid to challenge themselves under Jack Castleberry in his third season since taking over for Tobin Anderson You mentioned Jack Castlebury He said next year we have six power five games We chatted So FDU ready to go as we welcome you here to KI forum Joey Nissman plays it over for Eric Parnell and its Nissman Thought about it with seven to shoot FD used him to take a lot of threepointers Nice one inside is blocked by Hastings Out of bounds possession to Boston College The Knights had to basically replace everyone They returned only 3 of their scoring from last year They lost their top eight scorers This can be the model at times now in college basketball in 2025 but uh its a lot new this year for FDU It is the model Coach Casper said one of his goals is to keep four or five guys in the rotation every year moving forward Here is Luca Taves getting his third start in a row at the point for Boston College Six to shoot for Fred Payne There is Donald Han Walks into a three and its in and out Hans struggles from distance continue Still just trying to find that threepoint shot You know the free throw percentage has improved pretty precipitously since early in the season trying to find that threepointer to go along with it Hes still averaging 15 points a game Theres a nice look inside Ta Jackson the senior from Denver Colorado has the first points Nice set by FDU Heres Fred Payne for three Thats a little long Iron Unkind so far for the Eagles who have struggled all year from distance Its been their Achilles heel Its 28 from three Theyre averaging 7 and 12 makes per game A conversation that Earl Grants talked a lot about Theres been moments where it felt like it was starting to improve a bit Heres Jackson from deep Thats no good And Hastings using his size had the advantage there against the 61 Ray Sean Johnson He gets the rebound Hastings made his presence felt blocking a shot in the first possession Just rebounding in traffic FDU putting his zone on early Hand gets into the lane and he traveled Han might have traveled twice She took so many steps on that play Heres Earl Grant Fifth season with Boston College I mean you mentioned it He talked about it You get this little break for finals right And you got other stuff going on Certainly you got finals and everything but 12 days since the game against UMass chance to reset They got FDU today Le Moine on Sunday before jumping into the ACC Coach Grant shared that he tweaking things on offense Want to be a little more aggressive in transition They was more concerned with his team responding to the break than after you when we chatted this afternoon after shoot around Deep three Parnell that was halfway down We mentioned to college struggles shooting threes They defend the three at an elite level Best top in the country Heres Donald Tan Little handoff inside for Hastings and hes fouled applause Nice penetration by hand You mentioned his free throw shooting Its back Everythings back for that young man getting into the paint dropping it down Nice basketball play Hastings couldnt convert for the traditional threepoint play Hastings has a very high ceiling Eric Hes already getting some looks from NBA scouts because of his ceiling Hes averaging 20 minutes a game just a little over six points per contest Hes a 72 free throw shooter this year Theres theres been moments for him this season We saw the double double against Davidson Couple of really strong games The block numbers have been there He didnt score in the game against UMass but did a lot of other things to help impact that game Its we hear coaches say this all the time Its so much the conversation Just finding that consistency right Thats kind of the the next and always the hardest step Consistency And in a portal era its even more important to find as quick as you can Coach Castlebury talked about that as well where every year you have a new club So still two nothing Theres a back cut for Parnell He lost the handle on it but the foul goes against Fred Payne Payne uh incredulous Thought he got him clean Payne has very quick hands FDU runs the old for lack of a better phrase the old Princeton offense at times Little back door cut defended by Payne illegally Oh Payne nearly got a block and the threepointer is good Parnell who was sandwiched in between a couple of Eagle defenders and he makes it five nothing FDU He Hes elite from three 77 of his shots from beyond the arc refer to Parnell Payne almost came from behind to get that one Well you know almost doesnt count Thats right Heres Payne for three to match Little bit short Rebound is Aiden Shaw Boy what an effort by Shaw to find that rebound and he kicks for Taves Extra pass Donald Hand inside and a foul goes against FDU as Hand once again getting into the paint Youll see nice out of bounds play almost blocked by Payne but not quite Parnells an elite threepoint shooter and thats what Donald does very well He gets to the free throw line draws contact Point of emphasis with officials this year is that contact defender does not have legal guarding position ahead of time Its going to be a foul on the defender every time So we mentioned it with Donalds hand his free throw shooting after a little bit of a slow start to the season He is at 80 from the foul line over his last eight games So certainly some credit there for working through some of those early struggles And its its a free throw and you have to take advantage of those and its because hes getting to the line so much Hes seventh in the ACC in most free throw attempts So its obviously a weapon for Boston College when the hand is right So old adage Eric you know you stop a run They were on a five run They being after you to start the game you got to get to the free throw line get the ball to your best players hands Coach Grans club did both things that possession to stop the mini run to start for the Knights Raan Johnson to inbound Heres Parnell That was short all the way Affected by Fred Payne A rare miss by Parnell from distance Thats back court Wasnt called but uh Im sticking to my story Erics little ball screen Heres Luca Taves for three Got it Really nice design there for BC They tie a game at five Just what the doctor ordered for the Eagles Answer in the zone defense with the three off two nice screens Luka Taves 33 threepoint shooter this year Heres Jackson straight on That was halfway down and it didnt go So BC one of four from three FDU one for five I dont know if you noticed the pace BC pushed the ball up Thats one of the adjustments coach talked about making during the mini break Donalds hand short from three that time So this has been a threepoint shooting day FDU five of their seven attempts are from behind the arc BC five of six attempts from the floor have been threepointers Here is Jackson Gets around a screen Eight to shoot Parnell was way deep He steps in and hes got it Thats a layup for him Great fake A fake is not a fake if it looks fake That was a legitimate fake by Parnell He has three made threes in backtoback games Now hes got two so far today Heres Luca Taves And thats good If you could do it I could do it Absolutely The TA Parnell show going on here in Chestnut Hill Massachusetts The sophomore getting his third start in a row And now the threepointers starting to fall for both these teams Taves played right here in Boston at Newman School How about more Not that time for Parnell Shaw with his second rebound Payne had good defense in Parnell that time Heres Taves Fall away two And thats good Excellent start for Luca Taves who has eight points Hes feeling it Luca Taves earning his minutes getting the start today for Earl Grant Heres Noah Nelson in for the first time for FDU Thats blocked but a foul Goes against Hastings and FDU with free throws when we come back Well threepoint contest breaking out here Parnells got two of them but hes been matched well by Luca Taves who has eight of the Eagles 10 in the early going Historic upsets that well talk about later in the broadcast even to the playing field when you attempt threes Coach Castlebury said were a better threepoint shooting team than weve shot so far So Carl Grant hopes that continues and is she coach Castlebury Hes hoping that doesnt happen cheering So free throws for Nelson He makes one of two The junior from Georgia came in as a transfer from Chattanooga So we said 12 new players on this FDU roster just three returners seven transfers who had over 300 games of college experience coming in Expect FDU to play a lot of zone They started in it Theyre back in it Heres hand on the drive Little scoop up and under It was a little strong Josiah Francis gets the rebound Some subs for BC Bapky and Chase Forte both in for the first time Kapki has high IQ player Butler transfer and Forte he could guard Forte and Taves are like point guard by committee FDUs gone deep down their bench as well here Heres Yvitch Seven to shoot against the taller Kapki Yvitch driving falling away Left hand is good David Yvitch the freshman from Serbia who we saw a little bit more earlier in the season His minutes havent been quite as high recently but we saw some of those flashes early He was the NEC rookie of the week week one of the year And that three no good from Fort You talk about Yep that field goal has to make him feel good He struggled for Serbian native to find the line from uh so far at 26 from three and only 38 from the floor A onepoint lead for FDU Heres Nelson caught next to Martino whos got it now against Capy 7 foot against Boden Kapki at 611 there Possession going to BC Youll see little shot fake by Gvich Kapki usually doesnt get beat off the dribble so easily Nice turnaround move by screaming still zone for the Knights Heres Capki from the ACC logo Nice kick for Shaw Eddie Foul applause and cheering Last two possessions Really really really like what Earl Grants club has done versus the zone So far they havent scored Pan going to the rack hard They have to penetrate not settle for the three Make two play one get into the gaps And that time Shaw going to the rack for the exclamation point Dunk just couldnt get it Thats what we talk about all the time When you see a team working against a zone defense if you can get to that conference logo in the center of the paint and work from there thats when you can really do something offensively Thats what you want to do As you mentioned you get the ball to the high post Defense has to flatten out and play straight up Gets people cutting Aiden shot nine for 14 from the foul line this year Makes that one and he will come out in favor of Acamod DC has really relied on their bench all year but especially recently three games in a row Eagles have seen more than 30 points off their bench Well Eric you mentioned that Asamoto has been playing off air playing very well Coach Grant agreed with you when we chatted earlier in the day Its looking for him to have more playing time been packed Theres a deep three Nmith is good That student My goodness That was from the the Eagle logo Division 2 transfer Much like guys transferring up in division one And a nice sprit Thats a really smart play by Noah Nelson to throw it off of the Eagle defender Impressive stop there Its a threepoint lead for FDU How deep was that three from Joey Nmith So because of the play by Noah Nelson FDU retains possession They have a threepoint lead on Boston College Great play by Nelson You dont see those show up in a box score Calling it off Bowden Capy keeping possession And theres a kick from Nisman to the corner and the three is no good for Nelson Masamoto is in there for the rebound along with Caleb Stiger whos in for Boston College Freshman sharpshooter from Dallas Stagger should play more versus the zone Hes a heck of a sharp shooter as you just said Forte gets in Here it is Stager for three Thats a little strong and Rodanovich keeps control The rebound Good work Nice hustle by freshman We did the announcements Jinx would stagger from laughter three there Theres a kick Stagger Extra pass As oamot for three is no good And the rebound Rdonovich He comes inside Little hand off Forte Thats no good Forte got it back Goes off the underside of the backboard And FDU comes away with the rebound Eagles missed a host of shots close to the rim Great defense by the Knights This is an FDU team that is tall Sneaky tall And their threepoint shooting is sneaky good as well Noah Nelson knocks it down He is four and FDU leads 1711 You you mentioned that Coach Casper I talked about that Theyre very tall for their level Extremely tall Five players who are 68 or taller on their roster Its unheard of in the NEC Here is Kapki working against the sevenfooter Martinov Capy good work to go up get the bucket and the foul How about that effort from Bowden Capi Nice play by Capki He was just backing him down and backing him down Youll see hes just going to stay on the ground and keep getting closer with each dribble Good call by the officials Cant go under the shooter Kapi a good free throw shooter going to the line through traditional threepoint play The Wisconsin excuse me the Minnesota native plays phenomenal floor game Capki his teammates affection call him bone I think hes such a good free throw shooter the Eagles need to find a way to get him to the free throw line more O Capy someone that Earl Grant was really excited to have Theres an offensive rebound by Asamod and BC gets another possession And so now all of a sudden BCs attempts are starting to add up Couple of offensive rebounds here Theyre already credited with six offensive boards today Asamot is blocked though inside by Ta Jackson A heck of a play by Jackson Asamot did not see him coming FDU is very impressive defensively Eric Yeah especially when the Eagles have gotten inside Theyve done a nice job Jackson backing down against Dosamotto Little fake goes up with the right hand No good And Kapy has a rebound Kapy does all the little things Came back to get that traffic rebound And now in transition Kapky lost his footing and hes fouled like he tripped over Sebastian Albro But again good shot fake by Kappy As we mentioned I believes he needs to get to the free throw line more And youll see right here Good belly up by Asamoto and Capki just cleans up the glass going through traffic to get there Too many times players are guilty of not going to the glass when his the other teammates are defending So the rebounds are 148 BC The difference is the six offensive rebounds for Boston College None yet for FDU but again they havent missed all that much Heres Capy Nice little move Look show here in the first half He gets BC back within two Love it Hes played in every game Hasnt started any but impacts winning I started to say Earl Grant recruited Kapky out of high school Ends up going to Butler for a couple of years They were recruiting Kapky and Hastings and now they got them both That threepointer is good for Nmith I think to finish that point in college basketball youre always recruiting in the free era in the portal era Five threepointers made for FDU Theyre five of 11 Heres Capki for three that time No good Was that a heat check Eric I ask all young guys that Oh when on when on FDUs playing zone theres been a lot of heat check today There it is Ray Johnson the sophomore Six threes for FDU They believe theyre feeling it cheering Little trap comes Taves does a good job to get it to Kevky and hes short on the dunk Theman thought about it instead passes it off A corner three is good Raan Johnson delivers FDU leads by 11 and Earl Graham forced to call timeout How about the Knights A little n nothing run for FDUs largest leads for FDU Of their 17 attempts from the floor 13 of them have been from three Boston College conversely they did make a couple in a row with Taves but just two of 10 from behind the arc Working against this zone for FDU now all of a sudden shifting a little bit Theres a foul And I think thats what BC is going to have to do right Get the ball inside as youve been talking about get to the foul line and try to work through there 100 You saw that time Taves pass the ball to the much higher Hastings forcing the Knights to foul Nonshooting foul with under eight to go in the first half Tames the end down for Fred Payne Active defensively here for FDU Theres Fred Payne a little bit of space with 11 to shoot They got to get in the gaps from the perimeter to they being BC And a foul called away from the ball An offensive foul against Boston College They called Shaw with a screen off the ball I didnt see it in real time Youre going to see it on the replay here Watch 23 and white for Boston College Coming to the bottom of your screen Tied up there with Ray Sean Johnson Interesting Johnson was really trying to get around and was more of the aggressor officials good officiating crew said too much for Mr Shaw Well part of the reason that FDUs had so much success is you know except for maybe the one crazy one that goes in from the Eagles loco at center They theyve been really good shot selection on their threepoint shots right So theres got to be that urge not to force even though youre shooting as well as they are Correct All within the frame of their offense Or on the other hand I think the Eagles would might be guilty of shooting a three too quickly How about that Noah Nelson his second threepointer Hes got seven Its 295 FDU Theyre on a 12 nothing run over the last minute 48 He wants to prove his year in division one Hes worthy Played at division 2 his career Heres Donald Tan Got his defender up in the air So he drives this foul And thats what the Eagles have to continue to do penetrate burst to zone to get to the free throw line So now the next step is BCs got to make their free throws which to their credit they theyve had their moments which theyve done this year so far today just three for seven but they keep getting to the line Donald as we talked about has been good at the foul line recently 80 from the line over his last eight games on verse the zone or in this zone one of the things is you dont want to give up corner threes thats why you saw Jackson close out so hard to force hand inside the three I say thats not how you want music to close out on hand because of the struggles from distance You dont want him to penetrate Donald goes one for two at the line He has three points Eagles coming with pressure for the first time today 212 Why not just try to change something the flow here for FDU Theyre really in rhythm right now Back to manto man Good point on your part Eric Change the momentum Heres Parnell Got Hastings up slides to his left and is no good from three with Aiden Shaw getting into the rebound for Boston College And a lob inside Hastings The catch has the advantage sizewise there And he is fouled underneath And again Eagles getting it inside getting fouled And those will have a cumulative effect as FDU will get in foul trouble and the Eagles get free points from the free throw line DC in the bonus now So a lot of free throws potentially coming here the rest of the way in the first half but they got to make them Theres an offensive rebound which has been a huge factor for BC though they cant make the second effort shot here Its already seven offensive rebounds for Boston College none for FDU but again FDU shooting 53 Theres obviously that The Eagles have to convert on the offensive rebounds which they havent done And they missed the front end of one and one which is like a turnover Its a wasted trip Eric Yeah this is one of those that you know theres nothing we can say that Earl Grant wouldnt be saying right now as well Figured the shots are not going to keep going at a 53 clip for FDU but BC trying to solve the offense a bit Donald Han good move Drives the lane Got another foul So they are getting to the foul line right now Exactly what we thought they would do coming out of that Earl Grant timeout And again this will have a cumulative effect but the problem is you have to make the free throws and you have to make the layups when you get offensive rebounds And the effect right now is Martinovs got two fouls Francis has two fouls And thats now two fouls on Parnell and nine on the team for FDU And this is the adjustment to coach Grants credit that he chatted with me earlier in the day about making They want to play quicker So when he hasnt when they FDU has not been able to set up the zone they forced fouls They being BC Lets see if they go back to that press after the main free throws that we saw earlier David Yvich is back in for FDU replacing Parnell who again will come out with the two fouls Thats big cuz Parnells their leading scorer Theyre pretty balanced scoring Balanced with their minutes Six guys play within 20 minutes a game Only one person on FDU is in double figures in scoring That being Parnell So Donald Han five for six at the foul line and all five of his points have come at the line Eagles adjusted the press a smidge It was a 221 that time Both times back to manto man 529 remaining in the first half 2918 FDU has the lead over Boston College on their eight made threepointers Here is Jackson against Shaw Got rid of it for Francis Extra pass Nelson No good from three Long rebound though Theres the first offensive board for FDU And that was unlucky for BC Taves just fell down He lost his footing Ends up being a long rebound and Yepitch gets to it who has it now with 10 to shoot and driving against Shaw He kicks to the corner and Francis for three was way off The Eagles want to run on makes and misses Theres Donalds hand driving Hand goes right to the basket and scores Coach Castlebury not waiting Calls timeout with the Eagles transition and Hastings gets into it a little bit So Boston College cuts it to a ninepoint game and lets watch the Eagles on the run and then well see what happened if anything after the fact Nice job by the Eagles again Coast to coast Theres a little tie up underneath as well Hastings and I didnt see who the Francis for FDU Nothing called there for the moment So BC gets it back to nine as now all of a sudden FDU hasnt scored in a little over two minutes This play is under review Both coaches when the other team had runs went right to their use it to lose it timeout Coach Grant went after you was putting on a clinic from three The Eagles scoring some easy baskets last two possessions Coach Castlebury taking his timeout We talk about this Each team basically in the game Arback says you have two runs The key is you want to maximize yours and minimize theirs So both coaches trying to do that by calling their timeouts You heard the announcement in the arena They are reviewing that last play to see if anything underneath is requiring to be a uh level significant foul Lets see if we can take a look So watch right in the middle of the paint Hastings 22 for BC tied up with 15 Josiah Francis for FDU Theyre just trying to Theyre just trying to get untangled too Yeah Hastings has missed a lot of bunnies and that could be his frustration Hes clearly frustrated See Coach Grant doing a great job calming the young fella down Love the emotion by Hastings and I thought the play was innocent enough The ball literally got wedged between them They were block one guy going to the offensive glass Francis blocking out each guy doing their job So the music officials discussing Bert Smith Eric Lewis Isaac Barnett as our officiating crew today And I believe theres going to be music nothing there Just incidental contact It wont be a flagrant one Definitely not a flagrant two Flagrant one is two shots of the ball and thats for excessive means I dont believe that it was excessive After review of the previous play we have a dead ball contact technical file on 15 blue and 22 white Those penalties offset We will put the ball in at the point of interruption and go down So they just call the common cop out the common copout Each guy has now that counts as a personal foul as well Eric The technical fouls So and thats two on Hastings and its three on Francis So again old school coach John Shyman thinks it was a basketball play They got tangled up Hastings obviously emotional frustrated Could have been no call on both players and has impact as you mentioned Third foul on Francis second foul on Hastings Yeah they got to get Francis and he is going to come out here Correct or actually hes not allowed because hes not yet Yep He wasnt at the table in time So FDU back on possession Theyre trying to get back into the flow Eagles have done a good job disrupting things Thats a held ball Possession will go back the other way Good job by Eagles Third time weve seen that zone press First time weve seen the trap I thought they actually forced the travel when we see we see the replay before even the original double team and you you asked this earlier off air Teams play zone they want to hide something to force you to do something Same way you press for two different reasons to speed up or slow down Eagles trying to change pace and force FDU to speed up offensively Good little run by the Eagles FDU was over 50 from the floor and from three Theyve now missed their last four shots in a row FDUs last eight attempts from the floor have been threepointers Heres Fred Payne for three That was a little bit strong Offensive rebound though to Capy Another offensive board for BC Taves no good from three here but they got another one Just couldnt quite secure it Maybe they did playing on the court right now Wow FCU ball Pinball What did you call it Its like Plinko Well is right Right Jack all over the No thats good And what that the ball going out of bounds allows the Eagles to set up their press This is a comical replay folks Both teams playing really hard but its like this butter on the ball I the one note I will make out of that though is that one obviously kind of whatever but BCs been good on the offensive boards today Been a really big factor Superior They just need to convert Its 81 right now That sounds like superior to me Y Oh boy A little fake Yep No good I mentioned this earlier Brookus Knights fake really really well DC sliding left Now were back for Taves 2920 still our score Weve held here for a bit Donald Han again driving slashing kicking for Fred Payne cheering Looking to go down the baseline against Nmith Comes out for Capy Six to shoot for BC Heres Han Thats a two and its good I like passing up the three gets the higher percentage too and Donald Han has nine points Phenomenal possession by the Eagles They got the ball to all five players burst his own shrunk it Han got the midrange game which hes as good as anybody in the country at So now all of a sudden its a 7 nothing run for Boston College Cut it down to 2922 FDU led by as much as 14 inside for Martinoff Another three ball That was a little bit strong and then a foul on the rebound attempt and they get an offensive foul a push on the rebound attempt So BC ball history Jack Castleberry was an assistant on that team He got the head coaching job the next year when Tobin Anderson left to replace Rick Patino at Iona It was you know the the funny thing about what we talked about before about how tall this team is and we talked about how odd that was because that 2023 team was one of the smallest teams in the country when they pulled off that win A lot of guys transferred with covenants from division 2 St Thomas Aquinus They had a great run winning a game in the playin if you will in Dayton then taking down Purdue and the other 116 was UNMBC verse Virginia and current co Virginia coach Ryan ODM was the coach of UNMBC at that time full circle moment after you ended up losing in the second round of the NCA tournament to FAU of course ended up making that surprise final four run that year theres a nice take by Ta Jackson the senior started at BMI for a couple of years then at Northern Colorado last year before coming to FDU Stops a long run for the Knights long scoreless streak Threepoint shooting has gone a little bit cold BC going to work Hand whos been very active today Offensive rebound Its been a huge factor for BC They take advantage of it here Hand driving slashing right hand No but a foul Another applause long possession for the Eagles Like to see them gather and go up a little stronger with two off the offensive rebounds or a kick out as Kapki did for open threes Best time to shoot a three an open three is off an offensive rebound with the kick out cuz the defense collapsed looking at the basketball So Donald Han to 11 points now with that make He is 7 for9 from the foul line I think the thing hes learning and you know obviously Im sure he would be like to make more threes than he has but the thing hes learning is how to score without that threepoint shot cuz again hes still averaging 15 points a game Hes still at you know today hes gotten to 12 points despite being just 206 from the floor Hes getting his points correct and some guy by the name of SGA has done very well at doing it at a higher level Well Han can get fouled Thats his great strength in the way the games officiated Im going to let you make that comp right there I did laughter Well I love guys who get fouled Well I would have done Walt Frasier but nobody knows who he is No well hell text our buddy Tyler Murray about that one Well my point is Wal Clyde Frasier was phenomenal at that Theres a three from the corner Fred Payne is no good after Martinoff missed at the other end Then a held ball possession to FDU with 121 to go first Thats my point Eric that Ive harped on at nauseium all half Papy did a great job getting the rebound but got stuck going up instead of trying to go up and pivot kick it out You have a re the clock resets to 20 So just make one extra pass Sure Coach Grant will talk about that at halftime Zone press continues for the Eagles So its 3125 FD Again remember they led by as much as 14 points 2915 at the 711 mark of this first half And BC is closed getting to the foul line and mostly on Donald making his free throws Jackson kind of slid there but did enough to keep his footing And the foul goes against Aiden Shaw Well Jackson high IQ play because he lost his feet but Shaw was Shaw was a little undisiplined going for the fake Fairley Dickson has faked as well as any team weve seen all year To their credit their shot fakes And we used to teach as I said earlier on the broadcast fake has to look real It looks fake Its not a fake cheering Free throw good for Ta Jackson Coach Castlebury couldnt say enough nice things about Jackson and his inside presence He leads the team in rebounds at 77 Hes just really consistent Well we mentioned he started at BMI Thats where Coach Castleberry played He started as a walkon earning his full scholarship Lot of those Cinderella stories on FDU Six points for Jackson 3325 is our score Tesl driving hand goes up and its blocked What a defensive effort there for FDU Out of bounds Itll stay here 28 on the possession 414 to go in the half Great hustle by FDU Three guys to the floor Todd Jackson Just absolute rejection of Donald Holy smokes You can see why coach Castlebury was singing his praise Well see inbounds Actually the possession was at 13 off the reset Get that right cheering Rodanovich thought about it Instead driving in Rodanovich goes up short on the right hand Nearly had his own rebound Probably would have been a shot clock violation anyway And now FDU will slow down Well see if they want Remember they already used their use it or lose it timeout So they will play out here Theyll take it all the way down And just one of their last eight from the floor after starting 50 from three Here is Jackson driving That is affected by hand And theyll say it was out of bounds FDU ball with 36 to go Def straight up And I think youll see this hits the shot clock Correct And it I think it hit Shaw last So good call by the official Coach Grant wants is asking for a challenge on the possession So well take a break Remember this was one of the additions this season in mens college basketball So Earl Grants going to ask the officials to go over previous play is under reboot for a coachs challenge regarding the out ofbounds call So Eric Im all for challenging everything that we want to get it right I say this no matter what sport Lets see again You you see the effort by Donald T Oh it was kind of not sure pushes that straight up And the question will be is there a look that shows whether Jacksons hand was still on it last or whether Donald Hans hands was the one laughter thats about I saw I saw the three and I thought it was Shaw Shaws not on the floor So it was hands But what I started my diet tribe is were all for this but just needs to be a time limit Well on the replay lets see if you got a look at it right here This might be your best look And looks like no eagle touched it There may be an argument here Coach Grant has an argument Thats Jackson and gets a piece maybe right there And that looks like its still on the fingers of Jackson The question will be remember the call on the floor being FDU ball So is there indisputable evidence to overturn this That looked very close right there Interesting So there are the rules this year The new coachs challenge If you get it right youll receive a second one Again you must have a timeout in order to After review of the previous play the ball did not hit a Boston College player So Boston College will be awarded the ball It will be their ball on the end line with 39 seconds Coach Castlebury is a little indifferent as he was drawing up an out of bounds underplay to run the and now hes got a guard So the Eagles plenty of time Thats a great challenge by Earl Grant there And kudos to the officials did a good job to get that right So Eric 4 seconds essentially You have time You can make literally three passes You have time for a basketball activity time So its three dribbles three passes A fake So theres a lot of time for the Eagles to advance the ball and get a good shot Rodanovich will inbound Not guarded here He gets it to Donald Tan Han plenty of time Moving up the floor Got to the corner Im not sure he got that off The shot goes but if he did not get that shot off its waved off and so no basket Well see if the So FD was always able music to maintain a working margin as coaches like to say So 3325 FDU led in that first half by as much as 14 They had a 12 nothing one at run point The Eagles had an eight nothing run of their own at another point right after that 14point lead So DC to work on offense here and Donald Han quickly for three Thats no good And a rebound comes down to Mark FDU played manto man for the first 10 seconds of that possession and then went zone Oh theres that back cut OH AND THE SLAM for Jackson Great pass The Princeton offense Run to a T That was a clinic A 10point lead for the FDU Knights trying to come up to Boston and pull off an upset These two teams played last year with the Eagles getting the win Heres Fred Payne Corner three Yes First points for Fred Payne cheering One thing about Payne he never forces it He Hes a steady Eddie player BC answers with a three Their third threepoint make of the game Its 3528 Heres Martinov The sevenfooter switches to Shaw Martino now with nine to shoot Out for Parnell hit a bunch of threes early then had to sit in some foul trouble Nman wide open inside Jackson got lost and hes in double figures While Hastings obviously missed an assignment no communication that time defensively for the Eagles It was late in the timer Just one on the possession That shot goes down Todd Jackson with 10 points for FDU 3728 Heres Taves for three and thats good So BCs going with the threepoint shot right now and theyve made two in a row Luca Taves that time has 11 points Both shots were in rhythm with your rhythm I should say with your feet set not forced like some of them were a little early in the first half Eric Three ball good Eric Parnell Theyre like layups for Parnell Wow So after Jackson had the last eight FDU points going back to the first half that one goes Its a ninepoint game again Into the corner Fred Payne His deep shot is no good Hastings a piece of the rebound He secures it Goes up Gets the second chance points Thats what were talking about Got to feel good for Hastings He was really clearly frustrated in the first half His first two points Its 4033 FDU three for three from the floor to start the second half Boston College three for five including two from behind the arc And the Hastings did not score versus UMass Thats got to feel good for him Heres Parnell slipping inside his two from the elbow rolls in Proven hes more than just a threepoint shooter Even though Parnell 35 of his 77 of his shots rather from behind the arc I mean he looked great early in that first half and then the couple of fouls and he basically sat the rest of the way Heres Hastings for three FDU will live with that shot And a rebound for Joey Nman Yeah that was um not what they wanted He could That was his first threepoint attempts of the season Hartnov is forced deep here by the BC defense Jackson no good And Donald has the rebound with just six on the timer Fred Payne secures it Payne driving floating right hand is good So the Eagles go quickly that time and Fred Payne has five points in the second half What Fred Payne does very well it got into the paint but his shoulders were square when he shot the shot Eagles going with the zone press again Heres Johnson gets to the elbow That was no good And Shaw gets the rebound over top of the sevenfooter Martineoff BC feeling a little bit of momentum on offense at the moment Luca Tay made a rare mistake for Luca Taz He had each man on his hip Cycles around for Payne who gets into the paint and scores So Fred Payne the aggressor in this second half He has seven for Boston College Seven of the Eagles 12 Theyre back within five Close as BC has been in a while Heres Martinov spinning left hand Martinov fouled and he will go to the line when we come back So a good offensive start for BC Theyre five for eight from the floor to start the second half Both teams look good on the offensive end here to start half number two music on balance You know it kind of reminds me of the second half that he played against New Haven a couple of games back Just three points in the first half He had 15 of his 18 came in the second half And again it was a moment where you know sometimes you just need a guy to be a guy for lack of a better word And you know it feels like theres been you know Donald Han still leading scorer for BC and hes done it at times too But its felt like Fred Payne has had a knack for when he needs to sort of take over offensively Thats off the leg of hand out of bounds going the other way And the great thing I love about Payne he never forces the issue He could play Hes really physically strong You know he has a body of uh the wide receiver from Alabama on the Eagles Thats how athletic he is and slight but really strong Richard sophomore from Gramling Louisiana You saw his jump there from seven a game last year to 13 so far to start this season Arnoff Nice little DESIGN THERE ITS BLOCKED BY SHAW Good thing about that I love Shaw He was disappointed in himself for blocking it and not controlling it Thats a high IQ player He knows he made a great play here No no no Youre not doing this Eastman Not today Could have caught that Correct Yes he could have You know were in Boston so Bill Russell was the best that ever played at that 38 on the shot clock Melson good that time Theres a rebound and its Fred Pays DC has made five of their last seven from the floor Capy had some strong moments in that first half Slides left Capsky scores to the Pell Thats what the doctor ordered Bo as his teammates affectionally call him needs to get to the line more Hes averaging two free throws a game He should get four Hes such a good free throw shooter and just draws contact Did the same move in the first half Just bully ball and exact same foul too Cant get into the space Oh this has definitely been a point of conversation to your point right Because Kapki over his last five games hes averaging 39 free throw attempts per game Brent went six free throw attempts total in the first six games So hes definitely trying Theres Luca Taves who ties his careerh high Hes got 14 and BCs within one We talked about the first half the best time to shoot threes off offensive rebound Second half points Eagles have five in the second half Martin off left hand a little bit short Tapy affected him well and Donald Hans got the rebound cheering Theyre going to want to push here Eric When theyve pushed theyve been most effective offensively today Taves Nice little back pass Kappy traveled Most certainly did That little bump and then it forced an extra step Lets go back to the threepointer here for Chase That three was off an offensive rebound They kicked it out Taves finding the open space The bench is enthused with energy Again we mentioned Eagles have five second chance points this half They only had four the whole first half And how about the effort by Fred Payne kept for the moment by FDU but they cant get it across cheering And look how fired up Carl Grant is with his teams defense applause FDU trying to calm themselves down The Eagles heating it up Payne doing it on both ends of the floor Coach and the bench is imploring how much the Eagles are Eagles effort Its a 911 run for Earl Grants Eagles They are back within one screaming Well Boston College has clawed their way back within one point And you see what Fred Payne has been such a factor here in this second half Pay just getting it done in the second half Hes like a silent assassin He waits in the first half and feels things out Two games in a row just comes out lights out Kappy going to work here against Martin Kapy goes to left hand and Boston College leads Thats the formula Kappys been very effective in the paint and hes working against Martin off who has three fouls which Capki can use to his advantage Kappys a high IQ player Nice back cut but its bobbled and out of bounds Jackson through the pass Nman couldnt control it Coach Castleberry alluded to this Jacksons like the quiet leader on the team is what so many guys knew Theyre trying to figure it out Im really impressed by Jacksons play today So its a onepoint lead for Boston College Their first lead in a while Theyve come all the way back down as much as 14 Fred Payne for three No good Whos still out there playing with three fouls has the rebound They had three bets Not theres 12 minutes left Thats plenty Nelson goes back to his right Little up andunder move and its affected enough by hand was too close to the basket Hes used to shooting threes today DC has outscored FDU 1910 here in this second half And a foul goes against Raan Johnson defending Luca Taves And started to say this earlier in the half Taves does that so well when he has a player on a a hip and off balance You just dribble to force the foul He made a rare play earlier in the half where he didnt do that Taves has such a high IQ which is why hes earned more of the minutes at the point guard spot of late and we expected to see Seager play Stiger I should say play more Hes back in the lineup Donalds hand driving kicks for Steer Extra pass available Its Luca Taves a little short Captain got knocked down but theres the same play with Hastings but just less emotion So BC had a couple of looks at it there Its an 111 run for Boston College There was a The play had started the horn went off to bring in a sub for Boston College And are they going to allow Chase Forte in the game or not See coach Grant got to be pleased the way his clubs come out in the second half Absolutely They are not going to let him in right now That was an inadvertent horn So FDU will inbound from half court which means Forte was not at the table before play the ball was inbounded and then no problem Under 12 minutes to go here in the second half Its a onepoint game Nissan falling away as he drives to his right and he picks up the foul and he will go to the line when we come back to Kanti Forum A onepoint game BCs come back down 14 to grab the lead by one music It bids were very hard to come by for mid major programs coached by Tom Green who coached at FDU for 26 years and does Coach Green does the games on TV Thats right Now still in touch It was fun times So the free throw good for Nman screaming to once again tie this game at cheering 44 Talking about Jack Castleberry You see him His mentor was Dugger Balam who was his coach at VMI Hes like a father figure And actually Jacks father is watching you cuz he did playbyplay for the B for laughter the ODU Monarchs I should say forever FDU has the lead by one Here is Steager Deep three Yes Thats why hes in the lineup He scored400 points in high school in Dallas Thats a lot And hes a marksman Earl Grant loves his threepoint shot And you get a display of it right there The freshman from Dallas BC by two Even deeper three Little bit of a force there for Nman but an offensive rebound for Francis Nman driving against Kappy Kicks for Francis Cycles around Shots in short from three So FDU is now one of their last 11 from three after their all world start Eagles doing a much better job closing out on the threes is one of the difference She saw it right there by hand And that one goes How about Noah Nelson This not have been a good day for the announcer Thanks Either laughter way or FCU by one Tight game once again 1040 to go Kapy driving Kicks to the corner Hand drives right back Finds Aiden Shaw Double team comes Tries that little pass to go around a couple of defenders Eventually its Kapki there Throws up a wild one And its out of bounds off of Shaws leg Possession after you Eric you mentioned another close one Isnt that the rule that BC all BC games are right down in the last possession Thats like the rule Thats how its gone Its been fun exciting stuff down the stretch So this is what were talking about This is their threepoint shot They were eight for 14 to start this game Just two of their They were one of their last 11 before that make there by Nelson So you know you give them credit for actually you know thats why you build the lead right for 14 when the natural regression comes But to their credit theyve hung in and now have the lead once again But thats turned over off the foot of Jackson Fred Payne back of the game for BC And he goes up with the right hand And again but off two feet was Fred Payne This zone press has worked very well Coach Grant put it in first but they were down 11 in the first half A onepoint lead for Boston College FDU just one of their last nine from the floor overall Deep into the timer Nman got to go Four to shoot against KFKY Nidman for three That was a pretty good look considering where it was on the timer Rebound still available and a held ball possession will stay here Was a great hustle play by Stagger They were going to get an easy basket Stagger got on the floor taking advantage of his minutes Youll see getting on the floor and making a play is Steager So off the hel ball FDU will get another crack at this Weve gone back and forth here Onepoint leads either way for a bit Theres Nelson right off the inbound That was a good look It just didnt go And Stagger secures the rebound Taking advantage of those minutes I love it Forts in now running the point here Stagger driving Stagger right hand and he earns a couple of free throws His team was racing to pick him up The guys off the bench were coming to pick him up Hes infused energy into the lineup And that maybe more than anything is what Boston College has needed right now So you saw that you saw in the replay Steager went up with one foot and got to the free throw line where Payne goes off two feet gets traditional threepoint play Hell get there The rookie again first year from Dallas Texas His minutes had been up He had been at 10 plus minutes the prior two games before UMass Was just four points in that UMass game season high 19 minutes 11 points a couple of games ago against LSU Ill continue my reverse drink Jens surprised hes only a 50 free throw shooter Okay Well regression to me We should just stop talking I mean this is for me This is crazy today Its a twopoint lead for Boston College after one of two at the line for Steer Theres a nice look inside Noah Nelson And the hard part after you shoot so well you dont have help on that center cut Well executed play 5050 with 844 to go here in the second half How about this game from Nelson gentlemen He has had some big time shots Phenomenal Capy to his right hand Kapy Yes Nice little kiss off the window How about this game from Kapki Up to 10 points now for Bowden Kapki Five of eight from the floor today BC leads by two FUs changed the pace of play Theyre going slow possession Where BC was having success Theres a flying runner Nman No but an offensive rebound for Martinov Nelson again Not that time but another rebound for FDU Jackson makes the play Yep Is the one who eventually gets it Thats a goalend So count the basket And were tied at 52 Wow Back and forth we go 52 apiece after a couple of offensive rebounds for FDU And count it off a goal This should be fun Stay with us music I know contains shoot music a 5252 game Lucas Taves music who tied his careerh high with 14 points off of three is back in after sitting for a couple of minutes Tros really gone back and forth with his point guards music here Taves and Forte Caves because of his ability to knock down a three and his instinctual offensive play has earned more of the minutes of late What a finish this could be 52 apiece with under 8 minutes to go That was nearly knocked away Taves gets it back Fred Payne had an opening kick Stagger three Yes that was perfect pain penetrating Knows exactly where the best shooter on the floor is Wearing white Boy has Caleb Steager ignited some energy into these Boston College Eagles Hes got me excited I love when kids get their chance to take advantage Threepoint lead and that makes it a onepoint lead as how about Martino going up and under for the sevenfooter What a factor to sevenfooter on this level Donald Ham quickly for three No Hastings offensive rebound Yes thats a big boy play by Hastings right there over the sevenfooter Hastings is usually not the sprawler of the matchup He might have gotten bumped a little bit on that rebound attempt to take the basket anyway I dont know if hes a contact wear guy or not but he was like No youll see Hastings on the just ripping the ball and going up strong off of two feet Ive emphasized that a lot today creates balance Last foul went against Steager So now the interesting piece will be can either of these teams pull away It feels like weve gone back and forth Onepoint lead twopoint lead Now its three for Boston College Can any team get on a run Gone back and forth here recently Yeah Titch No Boy Martinov got a piece of it again on the offensive rebound FDU has dominated the O glass in the second half as BC did in the first half Seven offensive rebounds in the second half Nelson That was way long and it came up short because of it And another old rebound Has it and he gets the timeout Wow Dominating Coach Grant cant be happy with that The way his teams get out rebounded on that end of the floor As you said it was dominant one way FDU led by as much as 14 points They were up 2915 with 711 remaining in the first half And BC is actually on their largest lead of the game at this point music Theyve outscored FDU by 11 points in the second half Game started to turn for the Eagles when Coach Grant called time out and music went to the zone press That then it was a spell with neither team could score BC didnt cut into the league as much as they should have Wow With just two on the timer Kira Martinov has five points and FDUs back within one That wasnt good That was a great out of bounds after a timeout play by coach Castleberry in their zone which has made life difficult all day Fred Payne walks in his threepointer no good Long rebound to hand Then its Luca Tay straight on three is good Weve talked about it all game Threes with your feet set off on rebounds Best time to shoot them cheering 10 second chance points for Boston College in this second half Luca Taves a careerhigh 17 Niceman in No on the jumper and Hastings affected the defense Has the rebound BC has been at their best when theyve run today offensively Largest leadet Largest lead for the Eagles Seager for three Thats no good All of a sudden that was one that was so open That would have brought the house down 522 to go A fourpoint lead for Boston College No call either way Yep Ditch shooting practice He couldnt believe it was so open Well it it there there might have been a little arm extending there Im not sure how much contact there was in the process Decide not to call it Either way has played very well Hes struggled to date How about Fred Payne driving in slashing and scoring Kanes having a phenomenal second half again Hard dribble off two feet taking contact finishing Its 11 points in the second half All 11 of his points today for Fred Payne have come here in half number two DC leads by four Boston College 63 from the floor here in this second half Nelson for three Quick catch quick shot offensive rebound but a foul against Jackson So that is not an offensive rebound because he cheated to get it So then Jackson pushed Jacksons played a very good game You see going to the bench there Looks a little Nope Not going to the bench Jackson looks a little banged up Watched him play only today You see his facial expression Hes a gamer Its his second foul Martino comes off the Ford here Nelson as well DC by four Donald Tan driving up to his left against Johnson Tan now a triple team comes Got to be someone open Its Taves That was long Wow Eagles gave up a lot of shots Pretty good look too That was great ball movement Couldnt get it dropped So now under four minutes to go BC leads by four Yevich playing in crucial minutes down the stretch music here for FDU Raan Johnson for Taan Jackson against Haves Jackson that falls off and BC secures the rebound with Fred Payne Fred Payne has done everything for the Eagles in the second half Yepitch fell down and they call a blocking foul against Yepitch He was trying to bait them Maybe I was watching Payne with the ball and didnt see the action Down the stretch we go Boston College holding on to its largest lead of four Confidence played at the Newman School here in Boston from Tokyo Just really one of the highest IQ guys weve seen all year is Luca Taves Really love watching him play Austin College is going to leave Seager in there Hes kind of been an energy bug in a positive way here in this second half So hes getting the minutes right now for Grant Here is Fred Payne 13 to shoot for Boston College They lead by four over FDU Heres Taves Can he do it again Yes No one elses drinks this time partner at 20 What a game for Luca Taves Hes now put his three best point totals with Boston College over his last four games What a lift he has been for the Eagles late today Knee spin That was too strong Cathy had cheering a piece of it Red Paynes got it Eagles are getting the rebounds now Aiden Shaw out front is bumped from behind and fouled by Yevich Its going to be the sixth foul on a night means its out of bounds Look at this Tavs action Nice screen by Capki Fred Payne has played almost a perfect second half delivering the pass that time both ends of the floor And what I like coach Grant has kept Steager in the game as you mentioned and put Shaw in for defense and Donald Hand is out as we finish the game Heres Fred Payne SBC does get it in Long trip for the Eagles is the right play here Partner six possessions left in the game Donald extra one for Payne Slide Staker Yes cheering I know weve seen a lot of things happen but thats as big as it gets Thats close to the dagger Not the dagger but its close An eight nothing Boston College run And they have stabilized things Their largest lead of the game at 10 What does FDU do to respond now All of a sudden trailing by their largest margin Threepointer Martin off Thats no good Gitch though has an offensive rebound Theyve really done a good job on the offensive boards in the second half Parnell fast ball inside Yep Excuse me Martino had to go down then spins and cant hit All that work and he couldnt finish at the rim Martinov might be fatigued partner Played a little more minutes than he usually does That was a huge miss Big swing the last two possessions Dagger three missed layup Even on that possession alone it felt like he had to do so much work Eight nothing Boston College run Fred Payne slides Kapki right hand Yes in Or now Im sorry they call an offensive foul on Kapki And when we see the replay I predict youre going to see Kapki lowering his shoulder and forcing the contact Lets see if my eyes deceive me Nope I I had that one right Were starting Weve laughter been wrong all day Trying to get one right No thats thats the right call Good aggressive play by Capki A little too good And he knew he maybe knew he was coming out for DJ Han So Eagles just need a couple of good stops to finish the effort Bunch of good foul shooters in there as well 116 remaining in the second half FDU got to go quickly here 10point game Martin off been the one with the ball a lot here down the stretch cheering And its stripped away And now FTUs got a foul Eagles going to take it all the way down if the Knights dont foul Theyre going to play it out defensively with under a minute to go Boston College leads by 10 in a game they trail by as much as 14 points in the first half Martinoff commits his fourth foul and that is seven as you talked about So Boston College will shoot the rest of the way Eric Im just surprised they didnt foul a little earlier if they were going to foul Right So to me the whole game changed in the first half After he was up 14 Coach Grant decided to go to that zone press and its really take changed the whole complexion of the game So theres compliment to Coach Grant celebrating Christmas in his 49th birthday in a few days This is the same day And again as we talked about the shooting right 10 of 18 from the floor to start for FDU they were 11 for their next 40 from the floor A lot of that has to do with BCs defense We mentioned the press backs manto man Floater Melson No Martinoff gets an offensive rebound Theres so much time coming off the clock here though Niceman for three He knew he missed it Does get the rebound keeps it into Yepitch I mean theyve just got to put shots up at this point Thats make for Martino He has seven and a quick timeout So the Eagles just going to inbound a ball If FDU chooses not to foul theyll just run out the clock not to have to make free throws Crew late in this game that he feels like has really helped him get here Heres Donald Hand out front He fell from behind with 207 to go Eagles trying to design something knowing that FDU is going to foul Well I love not like love throwing long in that situation Maybe H dribble it out Thats thats a philosophy thing Donald Han eight of 10 at the foul line today If youre Boston colleges the only thing you dont want to do is foul cheering Your turn for the announcers Right Exactly Donald Han still looking for his first points of the second half of the 12 in the first half And by the way those were 12 that BC really needed cuz when the offense was not quite in rhythm early he was getting to the line and at least you know started that comeback from 14 It was a lot of free throws in that stretch He was penetrating and forcing fouls which kept the Eagles in the game on the offensive end Here is Johnson to the basket He does not get it up in but does draw the foul Just 132 to go Been a long 30 seconds Yeah Coach Castleberry is uh asking the officials to review for goalending I didnt think there was but he thought the Eagles might have interfered with the rim Cruz taking a quick look cheering Looks like theyre satisfied with the call on the floor So now Johnson misses Is there a a prize if someone misses a free throw You know some places you miss two they go on the line Fergus on the Okay they missed two in a row The the young energetic crowd is very excited by these free throws cheering Very screaming enthused crowd tonight cheering Its a one of two for Johnson He has seven BC leads by nine And theres the foul Took a little while to get it And by the way thats Franciss fifth So hes out of this game But he didnt have a choice there after Correct He competed He played hard certainly had a play where he got Mr Hastings a little upset So 117 to go Caleb Steager will go to the foul line Not a ton of attempts this year Six for 12 I said earlier Im surprised somebody is such a good shooter Has not shot that well from the free throw line Taking a little I I dont even want to say its taken a little time for him to get going right because its about as a freshman finding your role right And learning a new level and jumping up to a different point but his threepoint shot but I think bigger today was his energy Yeah Im glad we have this moment cuz in practice today every time the ball hit his hand every player on the floor on the floor or in the team thinks its going in Thats energizing He did that in the second half And its a new CAREERHIGH 12 POINTS HOW ABOUT THAT cheering AT the end Now theres a foul from Payne who kind of undercut his man Parnell after the block Youll see on the replay Payne with a great block but then theyre going for the loose ball and the correctly officiated That was Yeah thats not a shooting foul Eagles are not over the limit Yep Again their defense have played exceptional only the 16 foul on Boston College Mark Ive told you this off the air and on the air The Eagles defense is the real deal Yeah Well when they switched out of that timeout it certainly changed the tenor of this game Theres a little bit of a grind to come back but BC does its job and they have a 7261 win
