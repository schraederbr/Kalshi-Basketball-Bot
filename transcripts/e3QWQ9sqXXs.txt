wake beat Louisville beat Notre Dame Florida State coming off a win over Miami on Saturday and we are underway with the S getting the first look and we have a quick whistle the clock didnt start AJ deai saying the clock didnt start so theyll get that sorted out and we will show you the coaches Mike young in his fifth season with Virginia Tech last three years nit last year NCAA NCAA the year before and two years ago won the ACC tournament beat Duke in the final Hunter Couture whos still with them of course had a a huge tournament Leonard Hamilton in his 22nd year as head coach of the seminal and he too has won an ACC tournament Championship anytime you play Florida State youre going to be guarding a lot of ball screens and you have to pay attention to dere green Jr he can pull the trigger from Deep and got to find him in transition and he just did but he missed the shot 39 from three look at the Virginia Tech starting lineup if you are unfamiliar with the hokes padulla and Couture one of the best backcourts in the ACC padulla a junior Couture a fifth year senior and both of them Jay had two very good games against Florida State this year well this is a veteran back cour padulla one of the toughest guards in the country and a good post up move Inside by Baba Miller to get started for Florida State Florida State can get the ball inside this is not a big Virginia Tech Team and Florida State does have size adulla the step back and he knocks down the midrange jumper hes averaging close to 23 points a game in the two games against Florida State this year and Hunter Couture starting out the game on Darren Green Jr one of the best defenders in the ACC he will stick to him all game long Miller with the shot fake now gets into the paint and hands it off to Cameron Corin cant get it to go but the weak side rebound is put back up and in by jayen warley thats one thing Dan that Virginia Tech cannot allow they cant allow second shots to this Florida State team going Florida State a couple of Defenders very aggressively trying to keep the ball out of sha Padulas hands in the back court and he took kind of a forearm to the nose and some words exchanged between him and warley as they made their way up the court well you have to expect that this is going to be more of a football game because Florida state is really physical they switched just about everything so its going to be really difficult to run your offense you have to make reads padulla the leading score for Virginia Tech at a better than 16 a game missing that Applause three warley the point guard not a shooter now off to jir Watkins he had 26 in one of the two games against the hokes this year an Aaron pass is taken away well that was a bullet right off the Applause Music Applause backboard Couture yes one of the best Shooters in the country thats his 77th three on the year shoots over 41 from distance what a great story he is was going to go to wford Mike young was the coach there young takes the to blackburg and brings Couture with him and Mike young told us before game quote hes been a joy to coach Over The Last 5 Years well when I first heard of Hunter Couture he had started playing for Virginia Tech and you watch him here just right over in the corner and gets a little screen to get that shot off you let him shoot it from the catch spot doesnt matter how deep it is hes going to make it just got beautiful form but he was supposed to go to wford play for Mike young and Mike gets the Virginia Tech job and I asked him about Couture and he says he can play anywhere and he was right now hes the alltime threepoint leader at Virginia Tech amazing we asked coach young before the game what do you like best about him and he said a routine he said every day come in get your work done get your shots up go to the waight room go to class come back early before practice routine routine routine every day for 5 years and Mike young did did lament he says you know its amazing to me that he hasnt gotten recognition on the ACC all defensive team and hes right like hes one of the best defenders in the league a turnover and here come the seminal that pass went to the wrong hand should have been to the left hand instead of the right and that leads to a wide open shot jir Watkins from Trenton New Jersey the transfer from BCU and Leonard Hamilton plays so many guys but if you had to pinpoint one guy who is more likely than anybody else to go off for Florida State it would be Watkins yeah Watkins is an outstanding scorer in his last eight games coming into this one shooting 46 from three what an offensive rebound there by Migel potit who has checked in and his hard work get padulla and the hook hes a bucket Padulas got a great handle and he can get by you with quickness but also with strength and he never gives up Ive never seen him tired in a game I remember Im sure you were with me and you remember too his freshman years seen him the first couple of times and say man this just a freshman playing in the ACC he did not back down an inch physically or psychologically from any opponent that he faced well hes one of nine kids maybe getting something to eat was a problem every day a good start to this one in the 89 game here at the ACC tournament the hookies and the seminal all tied up new fiance Chloe Brooks is sitting here at the game she is the daughter the middle daughter of the legendary Kenny Brooks whos the womens head coach of Virginia Tech Hunter proposed back in June of 23 on the back patio Behind The hanur Practice Facility really beautiful and intimate setting with her family her mom her dad and her little sister Gabby close by to celebrate and you know they now have three rings the first two coming from an ACC Championship from Hunter in 20122 and then her own ACC Championship during her senior season last year in 2023 so guys a lot of rings and a lot of hok love I love it adding another ring to the collection you know many years from now Jay there are children in their future people much younger than us might call their basketball games we wont be here now one of the tricky things obviously about playing Florida state is Leonard Hamilton uses a lot of guys anywhere between 10 and 12 in a typical game Leonard Hamilton teams always have two things a lot of dep and a lot of length in this team is no different well its like for you its like calling a hockey game theres a line change every few minutes but poua did a great job he got switched off on a big guy fronted him inside and then grabbed that tough rebound heres a good story Tyler nichel who spent his freshman year playing at North Carolina he is from Harrisonburg Virginia about two hours from blackburg he transferred to the hokes this year hes in a larger role this year and another guy who can really heat it up from outside the alltime leading scorer in Virginia High School basketball history more points than JJ red Allan Iverson Grant Hill you name it 299 points as Darren Green Jr misses the Applause three foua averaging about 4 and a half assists per game in addition to the 16 points per game this year third Team all ACC fourth in the league in assist with that four and a half MJ Collins on the drive got the shot off and hit boy he had to work hard to give the defense of Cameron Corin well really good pivot and when a a post player pivots away from the basket you dont have to keep him from going out to midcourt you got to protect the basket Florida State didnt do that and one thing with Florida State you have to give them a lot of ball fakes and shot fakes because they will go for some of those Corin inside and then into the lane with a good cut and knocking it home is Taylor B Bowen that was a nice cut by B Music Applause Bowen lower to state back within three again the two teams split during the regular season both games close each one on its own home floor theyre also two and two historically in the ACC tournament against one Applause another watch M MJ Collins here when he takes it to the basket he pivots toward the midcourt line and Tyler nichel when he catches it there another shot Couture had one from the other side another shot from the C spot you have to make these guys put it on on the deck and if you overh help off of nickel or Couture you know theyre going to drill it on you you have to make those guys dribble it couple more Subs coming in now for the seminal Primo Spears and jayen gainy both into the game Chandler Jackson is in as well and B Bowen comes up with a loose Music ball what is Florida States uh the best thing about their offense if theyre going to be good offensively what will they do well today they got to get to the rim and you know its not a great shooting team you know you have to stay with jir Watkins you have to stay with Darren Green Jr but outside of that you you you dont mind them jacking up shots the problem is if you give them space they can take that space up and get you into the lane Jaylen gy the grad transfer from Brown with the lay in to get him back within one and there is Lynn kid the senior from Gainesville Florida and what an interesting career he has had a year at Clemson didnt play much at all came to Virginia Tech didnt play much his sophomore year but Mike young said he has just plain and simple put in the work over the last three years to become the player that he is right now hes got five double doubles on the season hes really good rebounder but that was just a really good attacking of a switch Primo Spears got switched off onto him they just threw it over the top because there wasnt enough pressure on the ball bbo and a nice kick and the Baseline Jumper in and out for Spears and here comes padulla as Mike young says all gas no breaks with that young man and hell be at the free throw line when we come back really good sequence by Virginia Tech getting the stop and then beating the defense down before it can get set and there they are taking advantage of that switch right over the top of Primo Spears and kid lays it Applause in nice job buddy nice job Ain going to get going to get battle like that you keep fighting like that youre going to get were going to get our share and Mike young knew with the numbers and the length and the size of the Florida State front Court Lyn kid would have to fight here today well youve got to fight against Florida State you have to fight for position you have to fight for the ball but what Virginia dick Tech did so well there is they attacked that switch and you also have to fight to be able to make that pass because theres pressure on you and we talked about a little bit Dan Florida State thrives off of getting steals but if they dont take the ball from you they will give things up theyll give up offensive rebounds theyll give up some some shots and drives to the basket so ball security is number one for Virginia Tech you take care of the ball youre going to have some opportunities Virginia Tech an outstanding free throw shooting team 79 as a team padulla 80 he makes one of two Couture is 90 second in the conference behind only Joe Applause Gerard everything around the outside right now for Florida State now they get a look inside as somehow jayen gayy just went in there unobstructed well Lin kid is hard hedging and Florida State just stuck with it they kept running out setting ball screens and hes got to hedge and recover but they lifted everybody up is it psychologically difficult if youre one of the main stays for Virginia Tech youre going to play a ton of minutes in this game but youre going to be playing against two different guys for Florida State because theyre constantly subbing in and out youre getting tired theyre still fresh how hard is that its difficult but its just a different challenge like Florida state is a rhythm disrupting team you cant run any of the stuff you normally run against them and its in a way its kind of like playing Virginia in a way like Virginia disrupts you they do it a lot different Florida State wants to speed you up and theyre incredibly physical its just a tough day and you have to you have to get used to the fact that youre not going to get used to playing your Music way pulla on the drive left hand off the glass and good and hes off to a nice start Applause today and Leonard Hamilton is calling a timeout he does not like the direction in which this one is going hokes by six why choose a Sleep Number smart bed can it keep League top to bottom but youre right about Kansas it is odd seeing them in that position and then without Hunter Dickinson and Kevin mcculler in the tournament they are just getting ready for the NCAA tournament Watkins into the paint too strong off the glass and kid brings down another Rebound with all those bodies around its tough to get an outlet pass and run but the first thing is to grab that rebound and kick grabbed it with both hands the hokes have made their last six field goal Applause attempts the guarded by Baba Miller and they turn it over on this trip well just too tough of a pass to make trying to find Collins but he couldnt get through all that length Watkins a very strong drive past a good defender in Couture to lay it in and thats the issue Dan Once you turn it over it is so hard to get your defense set Music now MJ Collins on the wing warley on him the pull up from the elbow will go thats a pretty pullup jumper hes a driver first hes got a good floater but he is athletic enough to elevate over the length of Florida State seven points per game on the season but 13 points per game in his last three Miller posting warley shut off on the Baseline inside for the easy slam for Corin Corin did a nice job on the Baseline Drive of getting to the front of the rim anytime theres a Baseline Drive big guys need to get to the front of the rim and Corin hot lately as well averaging just under 10 on the season Collins oops possession arrow will keep it with the hokes take a look at jir Watkins here going against Hunter Couture just able to get an angle on him and went right over Lin kid and that a really good job of getting to the front of the rim by cam Corin he had 25 points and eight rebounds against Pittsburgh hes a spectacular in that game po into padulla who has just checked back in for Virginia Tech behind the back keeps the dribble alive cant get a shot off shot clocks at four now padul is free and hits it these Virginia Tech guards dont need much space how about a poised shot from Sha padulla with the shot clock going down hes got 10 already if you had to describe him in one word Id choose Fearless a good cut there and a lay in for jayen warley as the two teams are trading baskets right Applause Music now Hollins helping out bringing the ball up Court two taking a little bit of the load off padulla and couture couture actually on the bench at the moment boy wide open on the wing the three for Jaden Young The Freshman from Goldsboro North Carolina young thats his 12th three on the year he shoots just under 40 but all of his buckets this year have been three every one of them Virginia Tech four for seven from Beyond the yard Primo Spears elevates and knocks down a 15footer Primo Spears started his career at Duane then transferred to Georgetown just a high energy middle game player hes a midrange Applause Music guy Collins almost turned it over and now he did and then Watkins is fouled by padulla its a good foul that saved a bucket you cant play with the ball against Florida state theyre going to take it from Music you Shan padulla did his work early as the shot clock was going down he was ready to shoot as the ball arrived and so was Jaden young thats his 12th three on the year all his buckets are three he make him put it down starts at 6 Eastern with sports center on ESPN and then Reese and the guys and I hate to tell you but youre one of the guys for that they look at the field of 68 the brackets are announced in Bracketology breakdowns of each region the womens field is revealed at 8 Eastern and youre looking at one of the great coaches in ACC history Gary Williams so many great years with Maryland when the turps were in the ACC fourth all time in ACC wins Leonard Hamilton sitting there in the Five Spot yeah Gary Williams one of the great coaches in basketball history hes in the naith memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and did a fantastic job not only bringing Marilyn back when he took that job Marilyn was pretty low and he raised him up not just to be a final four program but national champions in 2002 what a great team that was oh oh my goodness Blake and Dixon Miller guarded by Baron Millers 61 working hard thats going to go and hes got a chance for three oh Baba Miller is really really talented he leads Florida State in blocks only shoots 29 from three but with his length and athleticism Baron just made a mistake there having that arm down and making contact but hes very skilled and versal he just needs to get stronger and get into the weight room and become bigger and difficult to move around but hes a talent second foul on Robbie Baron so he has gone to the bench Tyler Nichol is checked back in for Virginia Tech Virginia Tech is shooting the lights out they 11 of 15 from the field four of seven from three and four different hes have hit a three already good drive extra pass to Nicholl misses the three and the rebound to Watkins hes not going to miss many of those that was a wide open shot due to that du the drive boy Watkins is just such a physical driver and hes taken it right into the chest of whoever is guarding him he had one of his best games against Virginia Tech had that 26point game the other game hes two of 13 but when he puts his head down theres not a lot thats going to stop him and hes 67 210 and often hes got a guard on the other side trying to defend Applause him pulla with seven to shoot lost to three Miller the rebound Florida State almost made a mistake trying to leave him there good run but Corin cant convert now the Hokey in transition but they got two men down behind the play padulla doesnt care spinning it up and in and hes got a dozen doesnt matter if its three on five if Padulas got the lane well he is one tough player is he he is fun to watch now hes got his hands full with the Watkins at the other end giving up a lot of size here comes the back Applause down boy everything but the Finish he got it back hes going to try it again and hes got a chance for three Fula did a great job on the initial backd down just making Watkins take a really tough shot over him he missed it but he thought he was there on that charge attempt theres nothing he can do here if youre not going to send a double just make it a tough shot he healed it but Watkins was right there for the offensive rebound Im not sure what else he can do there unless his heels were in the restricted Arc and Jay its the second on Sha padulla the high score in the game he sits possibly for the last 5 12 and a half Music both teams shooting the ball extremely well here in this one the 89 game with the winner do an advance to the quarterfinals tomorrow against the number one seed the North Carolina Tarheels nichel looking inside for kid here comes the H swarmed by a trio of seals and and the rebound down to Miller boy when you get the ball you got to look opposite there good pass and in transition warley lays it in from Miller as Florida state is tied it Florida State putting a lot of pressure on Virginia Tech in transition to get back and stop the ball and when you got this this level of athlete coming at you full speed its easier said than done theres the switch so you got Watkins guarding kid inside Couture dribbling into some trouble gets tied up and the possession arrow is going to give it to the Seminal Florida State making Virginia Tech into a dribbling team and when they dribble thats a chance to turn it over cuz Florida state has active hands and really more length and size at all five positions most of the time its really remarkable just a a very athletic and aggressive defensive team its not the best defens team that Leonard Hamilton has had hes had more shot blocking and they will give some things up but man they go after you and they switch everything and they switch to deny they switch to take something away Watkins shut off on the Baseline shot clocks at three does he know it got it off and hits so hard to keep jir Watkins out of the lane started his career at VCU just a natural score into double figures with 11 I like the idea of using kid as a screener get that switch they didnt get it there but get a switch let him take a smaller player down in the post Baseline floater not an easy shot there for MJ Applause Collins Collins done a good job handling the ball overall rley a nice look Watkins open in the corner good ball Movement by the gals just a little bit overh help you know trying to help on a drive but it really doesnt do you any good you get caught right in the middle of a threepoint shooter in a drive you cant do much about anyway Nicholl misses the three back comes green and this is where Mike young really misses Shan padulla out there just to calm everything down theres a four on two and kid will lay it in good decision by Hunter Couture I thought he might pull up for the three there but a good decision to give it to Applause Kid long stretch without a Applause whistle Darren Green hasnt scored yet and Florida States got the lead although Virginia Techs going to look to take it back on this possession and Mike young says yeah thats long enough it has gone several minutes without a whistle so we will will have a Timeout on the floor in what has been a very competitive game there is a Shake Shack right down the street from our hotel I hadnt noticed jir Watkins has been hot and again he is a dangerous dangerous scorer for Florida State you heard the phrase bubble teams of course thats one of the big topics this week wake and Notre Dame in our next game wake appears to be on the bubble if they win they would Advance into the quarters against pit who also appears to be on the bubble so we could have all kinds of drama this week here to Washington as nichel puts the hokes back on top yeah that was a good little drive by Tyler nichel rather than just settle for the jump shot but our studio is a well educated Bunch you know Tom Ken went to Central Michigan do you know the uh nickname of the central Michigan chipa the chipa very good thank you you are getting better then Applause what thats another joke thats a whole other story so meanwhile Virginia Tech trying to manage and on their way it appears Jay to managing about 5 and 12 minutes without sha padulla although Florida state has definitely gotten back they traded the lead back and forth but that second foul that was a big moment in this game and one thing that Virginia Tech has done really well theyve hung on the glass which is important theyre knocking shots down over and over again which is really important but theyve done a really good job sticking with Darren Green Jr you know theyve not allowed Darren Green any transition threes any threes in the half court theyve really kept him quiet Hunter Couture is a big reason why Virginia Tech is shooting 67 in this game 16 for 24 normally if youre shooting 67 youre leading by more than three yeah but theyre theyre giving some things up and you know because jir Watkins is having such a good first half well youre not going to get many more wide open shots on that Nicholls had a couple wideopen shots that he usually can and Florida State basically can hold for the last shot of the half Jaylen warley looking over to Leonard Hamilton to see what he wants him to do and now here comes the play call yeah with a a two second two three second difference they can take it all the way down and still have time for an offensive rebound but not enough time for Virginia Tech to take it the other way and fouls to give so Collins will give one the fif foul onto Virginia Tech so they got one more to give its amazing how few whistles there have been in this first half good offense at both ends Watkins comes back in for the seminal you want him on the floor when he got the ball at the end of the half and Baba Miller coming back in as well and if Virginia Tech is going to give up another foul here you want to wait a little bit you but you cant let the guy youre fouling get into his shooting motion and there it is Jaden young committing the foul J just took a couple seconds off yeah thats the thing Im not Im not sure how much that really mattered that far away from the basket you could have waited a little bit longer before giving that foul cuz the problem now if you foul youre giving up a one and Music Applause one warley on the drive Scoops it up and in boy what a nice play by Jaylen warley hes got eight as the first half comes to a close and what a nice fun first half between and green Jr I mean he shut him out in the first half its a big factor in this game as Darren Green Jr hasnt had any open looks good fake pulla had an open look now Collins has an open look good offense but they come up empty I think Virginia Tac has to continue to throw shot fakes and ball fakes into the Music Applause Music equation this is Watkins andj Collins on him at the moment now green gets inside a little bounce pass underneath Corin is Applause fouled and Corin with that nice shot fake to get Baron off the floor Corin does a nice job when he has the ball near the basket you know his last four games hes averaging 15 points a game 61 from the Music field and Robbie Baron who only played Seven Minutes in the first half is coming out just picked up his third foul Tyler nichel back in and nickel had some good moments in the first half and hes more of a shot maker than Baron is Baron a little bit bigger we saw something in the first half Dan that if Ive seen it before I dont remember it Florida State whistled for one foul in 20 minutes of Play Its remarkable I dont ever remember Applause that Applause Watkins on padulla Applause he tried to set a screen with Lin kid but he didnt set the screen now theyve doubled their foul total for the game but Lin Kidd has to set that screen if he decides he wants to slip out of it there wont be a switch but if he can get that switch he can roll a smaller player down into the Applause post well good ball pressure on the inbounds break kid got rid of it in a hurry and that almost forced to walk now heres that switch and an Aaron pass sails out of bounds back to the seminal you just have to lob it up that was just too strong of a pass because kid kid was open for just a little short lob in terms of what each of these teams would have to accomplish to have a chance to get into the NCAA tournament you would think quite obviously if they win out theyre in they get the automatic bid Virginia Tech comes in with the quote better resume they are 56 in the net 53 and 10 pom but that is still a lot of work to do but whoever wins this game does get an opportunity as they say in the quarterfinals tomorrow against North Carolina First points of the game for Darren Green Jr Thats how little space he needs I mean he can shoot on the move he can shoot from the catch spot just a truly outstanding score Darren Green Jr Florida State trailed most of the first half now up by four this is their largest lead of the game nickel an open look very little on the offensive glass for Virginia chech in this game well theyve made so many shots if they hadnt turned it over green was feeling it but missed that one but theyre also sending four guys back its basically Lyn kid on the offensive Glass by himself Boy again the ball pressure by the seals is really strong right now Couture sees a little space drives and draws the foul Tyler Nichol had a hard time hand Hanging On To The Ball but once he got a revers wide open Lane but little screen Hunter Couture having a problem getting over it but Darren Green Jr got that up in a hurry he comes off and plants that foot and goes right up and even if hes full speed sailing a little bit just got a an amazing capacity to make shots from Deep second foul on Corin toour at the line anytime he goes to the line this should be like a intentional walkin baseball just send the runner to First and lets get it over with howd you like to be 90 on the season and five and a half behind the conference leader Joe Gerard of Clemson 952 of the season Clemson the six seed in the ACC tournament theyll take on Boston College which defeated Miami last night boy a good seal there by kin and an easy Deuce for warley just so worried about Darren Green Jr coming off that screening action ly kid jumped up to help and Worley wide open on the reversal and a perfect five for five from the floor nichel again this 20 hits the assist to Collins yeah that was all made by the penetration of MJ Collins hes out a really good Music Applause Music game hes on green coutur on Watkins and now well see if Watkins tries to back him down or padulla on him my mistake and Watkins does back him down tip no good but Worleys got it blocked by Kid and the follow finally goes for Applause Music Applause Music Corin threepoint lead Florida Music State crossover by padulla got stripped Florida States hands are so active Miller in transition the step through and hes fouled by Nicholl yeah theres no way you can draw a tri a charge there there no way take a look at warley here cant see where where that is and my fingers not working but he comes right off the screening action and then has a wide open Lane to the basket and hes a driver you have to play him as a driver Baba Miller shooting a couple just 54 on the season lots and lots of potential for this young Applause man hes just one of those play and Leonard Hamilton Stan Jones theyve had players like it this in the past needs to take his time to develop they have developed so many pros at Florida State over the years and Baba Miller could be one of those but he needs the time to do it hell sit Taylor B Bowen checks back Music in where the best lineup for Florida State throughout this game has been the starting lineup thats where theyve been able to create a little bit of separation from Virginia T yeah Leonard Hamiltons played nine which is on the low end for him yeah hes shortening his match he can go as deep as 12 there have been some games where 11 different seals have scored had a little miss communication a Virginia Tech turnover theyre a little out of sink here in the second half the seals leading Now by Music four no you learned that on Saturday when I said it the first time oh did I well I wasnt listening yes a frequent occurs boy points off turnovers really favoring Florida State eight turnovers for Virginia Tech 15 points for Florida State off those turnovers Music Watkins the turnaround will go ohy hes got a lot of game well he can just back you down into the post and shoot over the top got a little turnaround jumper little fade away just Rises up in the lane the hokes have tried three different guys on him uh Couture Collins a little bit of padulla theyve all got one thing in common none of them are as big as he is Nicholls shut off in the paint now Collins off the glass no good well the best action that Virginia Tech has run to get into the paint Qui release by Green missed bu bone the offensive rebound so many hes there to grab the rebound they were battling each other and Florida State came away with a good cut by warley missed the shot but a foul underneath going against Virginia Tech he might have gotten padul on the blockout look at Watkins here just backing down MJ Collins and shooting over thep actually got some contact when he went up with that could have been called a foul but I think you made the point Dan hes not only quick and athletic hes strong padulla was called for that foul on a blockout which is surprising officials discussing something AJ Desai now heading over to the scores table and maybe it wasnt padulla I think they changed the foul and giving it to malel poti instead of 334 if were uh reading the tea leaves accurately here so it is on PO and that is good news for Virginia Tech because it would have been the Third on padulla and it clearly was 14 if that was the foul rebound rebound so jayen warley at the line for the seals the Junior from Philadelphia this is the first of four games in this building today the next basketball of the Season though they have won six of their last nine theyve really improved defensively but offensively in that ball game against Georgia Tech they were fantastic I mean Braden Shrewsberry was terrific Marcus Burton we talk about a freshman backourt that is legit Notre Dames going to be problem yeah the Irish average 64 points per game they scored 84 last night against the yellow jackets Marcus Burton the ACC Rookie of the Applause Year and speaking of Marcus Burton hes decided to show up at exactly the same time hes walking in as Hunter Salis is walking in Hunter Salis has had a great year newcomer year in the ACC a McDonalds AllAmerican from Omaha nebr spent his first two years at gona man thats a thats a heck of a job in the transfer portal three years in a row that Steve forb done nichel swatted away just driving into traffic in Florida state has three guys that could have blocked that shot close out there by padulla Green cant get the shot off deflected away stolen by Collins and he got grabbed thats got to be boy Jaylen orley just grabbed his left arm theres no signal yet that its a flagrant one but Im sure there may be a discussion here that was not a play on the Applause ball and theyre going to have a look at it theres no question good job on that diagonal pass by Collins to take it away but thats just a straight up grab yeah I mean I dont know whe they ultimately determined that as incidental contact but that wasnt a reach in going for the ball there was a quick grab there that could have been called but thats just depends on you know how they judge it was he reaching in or was he grabbing to try to stop him cuz that was not a play on the Applause ball so the the signal was just for a comment foul but it can be upgraded to a flagrant one based on what the officials see on the Music monitor yeah theyre going F1 yeah and upgraded to a flagrant one so itll be two and the Music bowl Theo FL Applause Music one and I dont think you could argue that really on either side I mean as you say uh just not a play on the ball so two free throws for MJ Collins and that it will be Hys basketball as well MJ Collins another good free throw shooter she was just shy of Applause 90 when you were talking about Wake Forest before with all wake and pit have to play for for the CAA tournament if youre coaching those teams are dont you feel youre leaning more toward hey were were going to Washington DC to win the ACC tournament Championship if you go with that mindset everything else takes care of itself doesnt it or or do do you I think everybody looks at it differently I am I am with you I love this week I love winning a championship I love hoisting a banner and all that but I I I think both of it play here and its I think if youre wake and pit Im sure youd agree its impossible to ignore the bigger implications and yeah you Im not saying you ignore it but its not something you lead with theyre not saying hey come on lets win this game so we can make the turn of right now the ACC theyve got three locks Carolina Duke Clemson appears to be a lock uh Virginia which is the three seed in the league Joey brackets has them in last four in and then youve got weake and hit beyond that if anybody was going to make a run theyd really have to make a run here in Washington here comes the double got a block good job by ly kid to come over and great defense by Hunter Couture he has been Stellar Hunter Couture is like a defensive back that the quarterback doesnt throw toward right you know so hes not going to get a lot of steals cuz he does he does such a good job early of keeping his guy from getting it five years in this program nearing 1500 career points 328 career re threes including the one hes made today as padulla Savvy play draws the shooting foul well he drew the switch first and then went right into gainy and Drew that foul that meant ly kid had a guard on him he had Primo on him so watch this switch you get the switch Lin kid just rolls Primo down in the post now you got a big guy on him putting his arm out its kind of almost like a uh James Harden type play of just going right in his arm draw the foul smart play by padulla Applause 11 and creeping back into it at the free throw line a couple of subs for Leonard Hamilton Cameron Corin back in also Baba Miller Leonard Hamiltons philosophy has always been hes very upfront with guys hes recruiting he says yeah I got a lot of guys you play as hard as you can for as long as you can and then somebody else is going to come in for you and your point about all the NBA players hes developed like they know at the next level you can be really good without you averaging 20 points per game they get it so uh you can still have a great long pro career show what youre wor at the college level when you come out of Tallahasse yeah theyre looking at also your per minute productivity yeah and if you play that hard youre going to be productive good strip Thea knocked it away Miller with the turnaround almost went and then Watkins is fouled by kid well in the first half Virginia Tech grabbed most of those rebounds in the second half its been Florida State on the offensive class so at the line Shamir Watkins honorable mention all ACC this year double figures including today in 18 consecutive games coming up tonight at 1130 eastern time the nothing but net crew will have a complete breakdown of todays second round ACCC tournament games all Luke Hancock at halftime they do a great great job day and night theyre here all week and keeping everybody up to date on everything you need to know here in DC youre talking about jir Watkins of Florida State he leads this team in rebounding as well leads him in assists and steals hes not just a scorer he does everything for Leonard Hamilton good cut nickel from the elbow Bo that cut was so important to make yourself available because padulla picked up his dribble ly kid was well defended in the low post Tyler Nicholl very smart making that cut foren gave it right back to Applause Spears Watkins guarded by Couture Miller over the top its still live and its still Florida States how did Corin keep that alive and now it belongs to the hookes we will step aside 8 minutes into the second half got a good one going Florida State leading by Music four youre too soft with your rebounding youre relying on your athleticism fellas I got news for you theyre longer than we are youve got to Bow your NE and Box come on now come on Mike young wants two things them to be tougher with the ball because of the length of Florida State and he wants the Baltimore Orioles to have a really good year this year hes not as worried about the Os right now well we didnt play that part of the sound he can worry about yeah he thinking I got news for you guys the Orioles need to pick it up hes a huge Orioles fan and if youre a b more fan you can relate a lot of lean ears but he is excited about Mark Jackson holiday and everybody else hes got to be pretty excited about some of the play Shan pullers make it today too well I think we talked about it in the first half you know you use ball fakes and shot fakes and get Florida State off balance and better yet off the floor and padulla all he has to do is lift his eyebrows and people are going to go for it because hes such a good shooter thats a big time play by Sha padulla and he makes a lot of Big Time plays eighth in the league in scoring fourth in the league in assists and as we mentioned in the first half third Team all ACC this Applause year here was a huge reason a couple years ago that Virginia Tech was able to win the ACC tournament title that year Hunter Couture was the ACC tournament MVP I think if I remember right he had 31 points against Duke in that one made them all onepoint game yeah this is a tough as Nails back court with padulla and Couture and they have worked their way back to make it a onepoint game and when the shot goes up thats when the fight really starts green hit a three early this half can the seol get him going Primo Spears boy look at the elevation on that jump shot hes a midrange player mentioned he had been a top scorer at Georgetown before he transferred to Florida State but hes a a midrange player and when he sets his plant foot he just explodes Applause up Jen young back into the game kid inside and hes got a chance at a Point play another really good cut by Tyler nichel to make himself available just right on the lane line from the right to the left watch Tyler nichel Cuts basically to the elbow and that gave him the angle to drop that in to LY Kidd who had sealed his man off on the high side really good offense by Virginia Tech you talk about it all the time but I think sometimes its just not generally discussed enough how important cutting without the basketball is oh moving without the ball and look a lot of folks our age or or my age than much younger much you know theyll talk about you know how the game is different now but but it is true that younger players they spend a lot of time on individual work and most of the the time youre out on the floor you dont have the ball in your hands wow Miller just lowered the boom on nickel and thats an offensive foul good job by Tyler nichel to just wall up and make Baba Miller score over the top but lowering that shoulder is what did it didnt get him the first time but certainly got him the second time boy big minutes and very good minutes for nickel although as I say that they turn it over in the back court yeah really good job by Primo to deny that pass and that sort of angle when youre trying to throw it out let your guy release let the receiver release and go get it thats just too difficult at that angle nobody touched it so Florida State takes it out right where it was inbounded rather than where the ball went out of bounds Jaylen gainy into the game now for the seminal as Corin sits gainy is Music Applause huge good job by Padula he played the drive rather than the shot warley Spears for three and the rebound for Couture in Virginia Tech could retake the lead padulla boy thats a break for Florida State he just walked into that shot unimpeded well Primo Spears jumped underneath that screen thinking somebodys going to SW switch out he just gave up a wide open shot Watkins follows up his own Miss its out of bounds and still belongs to the Music seminal well that was an unusual decision defensively by Primo Spears they they were very fortunate that padulla didnt nail that three runner from the Baseline for warley wont go balls loose and nckl has for the hokes Florida state so active he cant make a an outl pass good fake Couture another shot fake Couture open short on the three he hasnt had many opportunities hes worked so hard on the defensive end Florida States done a good job taking away his open opportunities on offense thats just his third field goal attempt of the game and we got another offense to foul on Florida state bo Sean padulla very fortunate there through the charge but that was a risk to do Applause that thats a thats a close Applause Music one nobody on the floor with any kind of foul trouble each teams got a guy with three fouls but theyre on the bench Corin for Florida State Baron for Virginia Tech Applause pull of the drive and missed the driving layup that would have put him back on top I dont see that very often Hunter Couture having a tough time getting open hes getting grabbed on every cut if theyre not calling it keep Applause Music grabbing Watkins still with plenty of time in the clock out a switch now Couture drives draws the foul he is a tough cover man he really is I hes just so strong and hes good with the ball hes a good Handler Couture switches out and he just gives him a little hesitation move and then goes right into his chest I dont know what Couture could have done there to avoid fouling that was offense initiated contact 79 from the line just the first on Applause Couture and gets the Music roll winner to play the Tar Heels tomorrow at noon Eastern here on ESPN and whatever it was good to go I like the full court pressure by Florida State here you when they get out in pressure theyre that much better so Music Applause disruptive Applause Hollands little stop and go and a reach in foul boy the seminal thought they were headed the other end with an advantage but instead its a foul call Primo Spears just reached in there knocked it away but the official thought he got Applause arm and a much different story in terms of the number of fouls called here in the second half there were a total of seven in the first half just one on Florida State theyve already committed nine here in the second half and as we mentioned earlier Virginia Tech is one of the best free throw shooting teams in the nation well with the foul situation that just means they need to be more aggressive driving it especially on a closeout shot fake and drive put Florida State in a position to foul where every common foul n you to two Applause points a onepoint game Applause again warley not an outside shooter hes always looking to get into the paint and he did it very well but hes had a really good game in this one you know hes not going to pull the trigger on a deep one very often he wants to get into the lane when he gets there hes a good finisher nichel from Deep knocks down the three and its all tied Applause up Oki fans getting louder and roudier here in Washington right now good game and a steel by Couture and a foul by Watkins and thatll be two free throws for Hunter Applause Couture Tyler nichel the transfer from North Carolina after this warly Spin and finish Tyler Nicholls finds himself wide open and knocks it down B Bowen couldnt get out there fast enough has been as evenly matched as we thought it would be between Virginia Tech and Florida State all tied up at 57 a hard fought game with 702 to go the winner to get Carolina in the quarters tomorrow great shooting in the first half for both teams Jay its cooled off especially for the hes in the second half well after what was a physical first half its been a much more physical second half guys are having to fight through contact just to get the ball thats been physical on the glass and were seeing a lot more free throws in this second half as a result of it all things being equal more free throws favors Virginia Tech better free throw shooting team well especially if Virginia Tech shooting the free yes and especially if Hunter coutur is one of the guys shooting them Jess Sims was in the Florida state huddle yeah guys so coach Hamilton said a couple things defensively of course as weve been talking about we got to play without fouling we picked up 10 already in the second half and secondly on offense we have to get back to our patient ways we were patient when we took the lead back in the first and now we need to get back to throwing the ball inside and make them guard us at the ring yeah they were dominant in the paint in the first half not quite as much here in the second half Watkins nice kick Spears the pullup yes this midrange game has been on point and Watkins on that drive that was a really good hook pass to the opposite corner you just cant let him refuse those ball screens you have to force him into it hes got help pulla at the point B Bowen on him again Florida State switches just about everything padulla Drives By him but missed the layup almost like padulla was worried about getting that up quickly to avoid a blocked shot he had more time than that easy to say over here when you dont have somebody flying at you with a 72 Wings span warley B bow and a corner three and an easy rebound for Couture well Bowen was wide open but he only shoots 20 from three so Im not sure Virginia Tech is too Music upset poua just went flying and a steal by warley on the entry pass Music spinning warley lays it in and his big afternoon continues he does it such a great job of feeling contact and then going away from it that time spun away from it but he was doing a really nice job fronting ly kid and there was weak side help that just wasnt a very smart pass and now a turnover Primo Spears will lay it in and all of a sudden it seminal by five and Mike young wants a timeout Its s by five because of two straight turnovers and Mike young going to tell his team hey we cant guard runouts we turn the ball over and its Florida State points and thats been the theme all game long thats now 21 points off of turnovers Florida state has been really efficient in taking the miscues of Virginia Tech and turning him into Applause points thats Primo the demon Deens in the house and on the bubble as they take on the number 12 seed Notre Dame which picked up an 84 to 80 win number Georgia Tech last night boy wake was in a great spot lost three in a row late in the season did beat Clemson to close the regular season now theyll take on Notre Dame 230 Eastern right here on ESPN game summary between the seol and the Hokey fivepoint lead for Florida State and You talked about it Jay that bottom call about bottom row I should say right there thats a bigy points off turnovers 21 points off of 11 turnovers by Virginia Tech and a number a number if not all those 21 points are part of the 42 points in the paint Mulla Spears tried to knock it away from behind could Ts open just hasnt been able to establish any rhythm in this game hunter Couture he hardly ever misses shots like that only four field goal attempts theyve all been threes hes made one of them hes got six points in the game Florida State doing a good job of spreading the floor I dont know what you do with Watkins when he decides hes going to the rim you really have to stop him you have to hedge out on that ball screen otherwise hes going to turn the corner and get downhill theyre not making him go east west thats an immediate North Sou and Lin kid didnt really help out at the point of the screen and so if he just turns that corner and as they say as the kids say get downhill in my day it was just get to the rim get to the rim and there was a period I dont know when it started a shot became a look thats good look when I was playing my my coach said look you can look at the basket all you want just dont shoot it shoot whatever you do dont go downhill yeah when we put you in the game we just go downhill one of two for Watkins Miller kept it alive but its hokei basketball Millers arms just go forever how does he find shirts hes on Couture now theyre switching they switch everything kadulla gathered in by Collins but the looks are not coming easily right now for Virginia Tech a good help defense by Florida state theyre just surrounding everybody kid threw a double team missed it and the seals have the ball and a sixpoint lead with under four minutes to go but jir Watkins has not only had a great scoring night but hes the leading rebounder in the game came up with a loose ball and flushed it to make it an eightpoint game this is a 90 run for Florida State and Virginia Tech needs an answer right here with three and a half to go in regulation as this is getting away because of Florida States Applause defense Collins kicks it out to nickel ohy look at the pressure padulla short grazing the rim kid had it but its taken away he didnt go up right away good pass warley and its all sevenos right Applause now you wouldnt know it from Leonard Hamiltons expression which hasnt changed all afternoon but boy they put together a great four or five minute stretch they have turned defense into offense like crazy over the last 5 minutes when the ball has been loose Florida state is grabbing it and jir Watkins we just talked about him being in the leading rebounder that ball alive he gets yet another one and dunks it in and what a beautiful B pass by Primo Music Spears o price invest with confidence Florida State now with a 10point lead on Virginia Tech just 252 to go in this one the winner will play North Carolina the regular season champion of the ACC in the first quarterfinal game tomorrow we will have it for you right here no Eastern on ESPN so what do you do when youre the one seed you get your coaches in the building for the second round and you do a little Advanced scouting Pat Sullivan Shawn may Brad Frederick right to left they played the seals twice Carolina one by 8 in one game one by seven in the other uh Hubert Davis and staff and players have really put together a great seas season so far they theyve had a fabulous year where defense has been their calling card RJ D how about RJ Davis and Caleb love Caleb love transfers to Arizona hes the player of the year in the Pack 12 and RJ Davis the player of the year in the Atlantic Coast Conference thats remarkable they were in the same back court a year ago Davis better than 21 points per game Hubert Davis named the ACC coach of the year and thats a turnover stepped over the line Y that is the last thing that Leonard Hamilton wanted to Music Applause see as he tries to make this pass in just plants that foot right over the line Leonard Hamilton was yelling to the officials what did he do what did he do wanted clarification Jamie lucky gave him a hand signal like he stepped in bounds and Leonard just kind of looked down at the ground and Shrugged his shoulders nothing you can say to that but they get it right back they couldnt even get the ball in bounds and its difficult you know sha padulla is a great passer and hes inbounding the ball but hes small and hes got length on him we got Baba Miller there and just a terrific job guess who jir Watkins thats his fourth steal of the game Watkins has 22 points nine rebounds four Steals and hes drawn five fouls being as aggressive as hes been getting to the rim other than that that hes been kind of quiet right what a game for jir Applause Watkins and yes Leonard Hamilton plays a ton of guys and yes on any given day anybody can step up and be the guy but theres no question whos been the guy in this one for the Applause S well Jaylen warley has not been too far behind hes had a great game hes eight of 10 hes got 18 points two steals made them both and its back to 10 and really right now for Florida State you dont want to give up threes and you dont want a foul a quick two for padulla and Mike young wants ball Applause Music pressure they get it over two on Applause one Watkins going in there strong and kid gives the Applause foul you can have any choice it was give the foul or get dunked on really good job breaking the pressure warley made himself available right in the middle of the floor you got to cover the middle and back now thats getting downhill he went uphill too 25 now for Watkins Watkins on the season spends a lot of time at the free throw line he shoots about six of them per Applause game he is now just one point away from his career high had 27 at Syracuse back in January had a very cool free throw rtin a lot of guys you know take the deep breath but he closes his eyes too I closed my eyes when I was shooting him Tyler nichel with a bucket and heading to the line thats exactly what Florida State doesnt want to do not only give up an offensive rebound opportunity but foul in doing it and turned it into a threepoint chance ball was loose and nickel got it but just not a very smart play by warley to go for Applause that how about nichel with 15 and seven so far in this game hell come out and coming to back in on defense is Robbie Baron Baron gives him a little more size guarding out of bounds Applause underneath pouring ahead to warley the lob in the finish for Watkins and theres a new career high now with 28 what a screen by ly kid theel is Applause short Collins blocked from behind but theyre going to count it thatll be goal Music Applause tending Florida state has broken the full court pressure not just to break it they are breaking it to score good pass ahead and thats a beautiful lob and finish warley to Watkins warle and Watkins sounds like a laer pretty good combination today Leonard Hamilton did not love the goal tending call and the officials are going to check it before the under four timeout they wait until the next time out to check it when you get to the under four they check it right away I thought it was a good block I mean obviously its close but that looked like it was on the way up to me up up up up it might have been over the cylinder that might have been the yeah thats over the cylinder so it was definitely on the way up so this buys each of the coaches an extra timeout if you will while the officials have a look at Music it theres still a minute 56 to go time is ticking slowly here in the last few minutes and Virginia Tech has narrowed the Gap a little Music bit its interesting why its taking so long I guess thats true of a lot of Replay issues maybe this is a a clock thing now could be time in addition to that yeah they put one second back on the clock so it is goalen the basket stands and a minute 57 to go in Applause regulation Music Miller into Spears the gamble by Collins and now Spears is going to the line and if youre Virginia Tech this is the way you got to play it try to steal it and if not foul quickly and extend this game Spar is a 76 free throw shooter Baron the foul hes fourth hell sit nickel back in nickel back in see what I did ni back see what I did there stumbled in that that actually bothers Applause me dont forget Wake Forest Notre Dame still to come in the second game and then two more second round games in the evening session here in Washington made him Applause Music both Applause theour forces it up and draws the foul and will shoot three free throws hes just so smart I know we talked about no threes but no fouls was in there as well just uh if hes going to take that just put pressure on it you dont want to you dont want to leave the floor before Hunter Couture leaves the floor the defense always has to leave the floor second so now youre putting a 90 free throw shooter on the line for Applause three its a second Miss of the game thats so unusual for Applause Music him and again Nicholl sits bar back Music in sevenpoint game a minute 43 to Music Applause Music go Spears gets it over did such a good job catching it on the run but then you cant pick it up there and well use a timeout he got trapped and with a minute 37 to go timeout Florida Applause State you can feel confident Continental is the Smart Choice in tires shman J bill is Jess Sims here at Washington were just getting started three games yesterday this is the first of four today such a fun event you played in this event youve now been covering it for many years just a great week of basketball well the ACC tournament is the granddaddy of them all and I still think its the best tournament there are others that are fantastic and can certainly lay claim its a subjective thing but this ACC tournament Championship has always always had great meaning and still does and the teams fight like crazy to win this Music Championship into Corin and a quick foul I didnt see even a second come off the clock wasnt in a minute 37 when they called the timeout so now Corin goes to the line meanwhile the Demon Deacons and the Irish theyre uh stretching and getting loose and running up and down the hallway but the way that this one is going with with all the fouls the length of this game is being extended significantly in the other two teams have to wait a while well Virginia Tech basically has to turn into into a free throw shooting contest theyre are better free throw shooting team but Florida state has done a really good job of stepping up to the line and making these foul shots Thoren gets him Applause Music Applause both niichel inside for an easy layup hes got 18 points and now a few seconds ticked away off the clock but Baba Miller yeah didnt pick up the ball kind of kick rolled it over to AJ Dei so they stopped the clock and gave him a warning yeah its thats happening a lot you see it in all these games its almost like the inbounder S given to the referee like its a pickup game for check ball you dont they dont have to touch it over the top for warley into the front court and Watkins fouled at The Rim by padulla give Florida State Credit they have broken this Virginia Tech Pressure not just to get it across theyre breaking it to score good job job by Baba Miller of throwing it long to warley and then warley has the presence to throw it ahead to Watkins and this was going to be an easy two before padulla came in and fouled Music him theres going to be a lot of time in the training room by both teams after this one yep Watkins now nine of 12 from the line in this game if he makes this hes got 30 right uh correct its already a career Applause high what a game hes Applause Music at padulla lefthanded reverse will go and Mike young will use a timeout a minute nine to go and still a sevenpoint Def it for the hokes well if youre just joining us and you want to know why Florida States leading two words Jamir Watkins jir Watkins at 26 points against Virginia Tech earlier this year but hes done it every way a player can the versatility athleticism hes been driving physically and hitting midrange shots he can back you down get contact and score and he can Elevate at The Rim and hes also done a really good job defensively with multiple steals he what he had four at one points they have 5 four five at least just a great game by jir Watkins and hes not been alone I think Jaylen warley has had maybe his best game of the season I know he had 20 point or 23 points against Louisville but hes done it on both ends and shown great vision as a playmaker hes been scoring at The Rim Music himself know he was named after Jaylen Rose thats right how about the that theres so many danss playing now thats got to be because of you seems unlikely sevenpoint game a minute nine to go the pressure again by Virginia Tech but Florida State generally has done a good job handling it the trap on Spears deflected Pula another laying its a fivepoint Applause game Spears got it in the corner boy this long pass wow wow wow Virginia Tech basketball Florida State one turnover and just got rattled in a hurry and Leonard Hamilton wants to talk it over but Primo Ste Spears wound up backing up into the coffin corner picked his dribble up got deflected what a great pass from Hunter Couture to padulla but just not a good decision to launch this up long I mean that was a lame duck two passes in a row but a great pass by Couture and what a finish by Sha padulla and all of a sudden this game in hand in doubt so two turnovers and about a 10c span committed by the Music seals Music and a bucket on this trip for Virginia Tech would ratchet up the intensity in the drama even further and plus in the foul game its a lot different stepping up to a free throw in a two possession game than when it its a 10point you know double digit lead right and the Hokies have all kinds of scorers on the floor among them padulla Couture and Music nickel you just want your quickest good look right yeah but you dont have to be in a ton of a hurry padulla looked like he was seeking out the contact didnt get the call missed the shot and now he commits the foul on Baba Miller and if it was padulla and I believe it was thats his fifth that is that was a tough that was a tough shot by padulla to try to go over Miller but I think youre right he was trying to pick up the foul Miller going to the foul line hes just 54 55 from the free throw line Jaden young takes over for padulla Two Shots coming for Miller Applause coaches on the Florida state bench yelling out no threes no threes for when Virginia Tech gets the ball back yeah its basically no threes no fouls yeah made them both two big points and its back to Applause seven young in the corner Line Drive no and then another Applause foul and Florida State may have weathered the storm after those two turnovers yeah tier point after that second turnover where padulla tried to draw that foul on Miller Virginia Tech to win the game had to get a score there number two Applause L you know this is one of these moments say youre Hunter Couture youre youre in your fifth and your final year if they lose this game theyre out here and then they hope for an nit bit he does not know as he walks off the court today if his career will continue at Virginia Applause Tech Darren Green Jr back for Florida State well I think if you said to Leonard Hamilton youre going to be comfortably in the 80s with green scoring three points he just said I I dont quite get that math but you talked about warley obviously Watkins has had a huge game and they have found other ways to Applause Music score Collins is fouled by Miller I just dont know why you leave the floor there its just a two a tough two youre 611 not you him at for the h number two M colls Applause shoting Carolina getting the winner tomorrow at noon Eastern and again Wake Forest and Notre Dame coming about 25 minutes after the end of this Applause one Music and Watkins is fouled again itll be Robbie Baron he has fouled out of the game and Watkins going back to the line for two more how about a wake Notre Dame thought well Notre Dame beat Wake Forest last time they played yeah and its going to be a a question of tempo and Notre Dame guards had a magnificent game against Georgia Tech well the the amount of freshman accomplishment in that game Braden Shrewsberry and Marcus Burton and then Nathan George was fantastic theres a bright future in both South Bend and Atlanta great coming out with energy here in this one this is a huge game for the Demon Deacons that was a long warmup for them that hallway they should be good to go its like a hot yoga Applause class 10point game 20 seconds left boy Virginia Tech got back within five had the ball but came up empty and that is going to be that Leonard Hamiltons Florida State seminal the nine seed knock off the eight seed Virginia Tech 8676 and theyve got a date with the Tar Heels tomorrow afternoon in the quarter final fins
