They can score if they have to Terrence Brown more prolific scorer but Justin Pippens been just outstanding on the offensive end leading his team in assists Opening tip goes out of bounds and it belongs to Utah But Brown who leads Utah in scoring assist made free throws In fact Terrence Brown is 12th in the country in scoring He averages almost 22 points a game Starting five for Alex Jensen a former Ute now in his first season coaching his alma mater cheering Lone returner Keanu Dah and a corner three and the rainbow from Terrence Brown Yeah a lot of confidence from Terrence Brown He kind of looks at the Cal bench says theres more of that to come Brown who last year was at Fairley Dickinson and he was eighth in the country in scoring a year ago averaged over 20 and a half a game Day Ames fouled on a jumper and hell head to the line for an one Don Mckenry called for the foul Well thats what Day Ames can do Hes very good at coming off screens He comes off the DHO He turns the corner He stops He knows hes going to get hit He absorbs the contact and completes the threepoint play Tied at three is Ames averaging 18 a game for Cal Had a strong second half in that win over number 18 UCLA at the Chase Center last Tuesday night cheering Shot clock inside 10 for Utah Terrence Brown a step back top tough three well challenged by Dayday Ames and thats what Cal does to you Roxy they really play you on a short clock there is Alex Jensen first season played at Utah for the legendary Rick Majaras was on the 98 Final Four team for Utah longtime NBA assistant with the Jazz the last couple of years with Jason Kim the Dallas Mavericks yeah outstanding basketball to me Justin Pippen long on the three and the rebound ripped down by Sadu Trayori for Utah cheering Stepping out is Keanu Daw now backs his way in and hes called for an offensive foul and the hook and its the first personal on Dawson Yeah good call by the officials He was right on it Mark Madson who like Alex Jensen also played in the 1998 Final Four He played of course for Stanford who lost to Kentucky in the semiis and then in the championship game Utah lost to Kentucky the drop off the flyby and delay in drops for Terrence Brown Now you talk about Matt Madson Mark Madson Alex Jensen They have mirror careers in terms of their time frame leading their teams to final four is outstanding season and both have coached in the NBA We mentioned Jensen Well Mark Madson spent time with the Lakers on their staff Day Ames and he has all five for Cal Hes so good at getting to the basket and hes not afraid of contact Thats what makes him so tough You can go up there and challenge him or get a piece of him and hes going to find a way to finish 2 and 12 minutes in were tied at five All five for Brown for Utah and aims at all five for Cal as Keanu Daw rims out of three Lee Dort the rebound and Cal looks to push John Camden has space three screaming And thats what Alex Jensen has been worrying about Roxy is Cals ability to get from the defensive end to the offensive end and get a shot up before their defense gets set Splitting a double team and gliding to the basket It falls off for Terrence Brown And Cals running back the other way Camdens pass deflected Keanu does Headmans for Terrence Brown who cuts to the goal and a reverse layin and Brown has all seven for Utah Yeah very heady play He knew we had John Camden shadowing him and he did did the reverse layup which was a great job of shielding the basketball Brown last year first team all northeast conference at Fairley Dickinson It was the most improved player in the league and Cal makes it a threepoint lead again Well Days making it a threepoint threepoint lane Hes been on fire Roxy I dont know how you stop him He just has it going and its really hard to slow him down Here is Keanu Daw Don Mckenry down the lane Mckenry lost it going up Daws hes rejected Lee Dort fall and then a foul is called as Dort and Daw both went sprawling Yeah they might have called that foul Roxy because they might have missed the first one Uh there was I thought some contact on that play Uh nothing called there There is no contact on that one but there was some little less contact on that but the referees finally make the call A lot of activity the basket You know this is what Mark Madson was worried about in practice today Told us that he really cheering was worrying about this team getting to the basket on layups Really good at it First on Lee Dort and Keanu Dahs 71 on a young season from the line The junior from Houston who started his college career at a place you know a lot about Rice played one year at Rice and then now a second year at Utah Outstanding And is the lone returning player for Utah that was a contributor last season Yeah thats amazing if you think about it But you look around and same with Mark Madsons team and around college basketball Thats a kind of a norm right now Thats not abnormal You see more and more of it Onepoint Cali First appearance for Dewan Campbell as John Camden checks out for Mark Madson Campbell who missed the first six games of the year dealing with a groin issue made his season debut in that win against UCLA But Cal turns it over Onepoint Golden Bears lead inside 16 minutes to go Just under Its going to be interesting to see defensively what adjustments both of these coaches and teams make And each team has been off for almost a week And a foul as Cal extending some pressure and its on Justin Pippen of the Golden Bears But Cal hasnt played since last Tuesday And Utahs been off since they beat Old Miss last Wednesday night down in Pal Springs And Roxy that can work for you or against you Number one youre going to be rested and Cals got some guys healthy now but you you know you dont you lose your rhythm I used to like playing after a big win and keep that rhythm going And both teams had to take a break Injurywise for Cal they should have Nolan Dorsy back tonight as Dorsy has missed the last three games of the leg injury and a Cal foul on the perimeter and its on Dewan Campbell his first But on the other side some bad news is Reus Petritus who played tremendously A big reason why Cal beat UCLA last Tuesday night is out tonight and hes day to day Hes been a little bit banged up and not available for Mark Madson tonight as a corner three by Jacob Patrick Yeah thats what he does But you you youre right about the injury part I think you get Nolan Dorsy back but youre missing Reedus Petritus who does so much for this Cal team Tough challenge three Chris Bell comes up empty and Terrence Brown looks to run it up the floor for Utah Yeah Chris Bell trying to draw the foul there backing his way in The turnaround off the window and it falls out Sadu Trayori had it all the way down and it popped out Dwan Campbell brings it back for Cal Milos Elich in the game The senior from Serbia Now Pippen launching a deep three and the rebound Theres Keanu Daw who averages almost six rebounds a game for Utah Leading rebounder for the run in use cheering on the drive The leaner That one again falls off for Sadu Trayor but kept alive on the offensive glass And Keanu Daws for Utah Yeah thats Im not sure why or how Cal didnt come up with that ball Somehow Utah managed to scrape it loose and a steal Long pass ahead Trayori goes in Foul counted and one Sadu Trayori for Utah Seven straight for the youths Well Mark Madisons not happy Roxy And for good reason He didnt know his team got back in transition Only one guy back and then he said Look if youre going to foul take it early on the floor foul in the act of shooting and give up the foul and the basket Youll see a substitution coming in now it appears for Chris Bell on that last play It is Nolan Dorsy checking in for the first time Senior from North Carolina transfer from Campbell where last year he was the CAA defensive player of the year for the Campbell Camels Hes a tremendous defensive player much like Reus Petritus Hes a pest Hell get in your face Hell hell defend you Uh challenge shots get on the floor for loose balls Tough kid cheering Trayori started his college career at Manhattan and last year was at Iowa and the N1 free throw for the junior from the Bronx And thats an 8 nothing run for Utah Sunday night the Huddle Crew will have their annual selection Sunday special a twohour show that includes full breakdowns of the ACCs Bulls playoffbound teams Our coverage starts 6 Eastern right here on ACC Network and ESPN Day Ames in the key and Ames cheering with the bucket to end the run for Utah Roxy every time Cal gets in trouble it seems like Day Ames is their goto guy Just brings him back Just when things dont look good he hits big baskets Deflects the pass there Terrence Brown drives offensive foul Brown pushed off on the freshman TT Carr and thats a turnover and the first foul on Brown Well you talk about Day Ames and look at him get guys on skates takes contact he just gets up through you and then how about the defensive end I mean you know thats good job by TT Carr just getting to the spot beating his man to the spot drawing the offensive foul And a foul on the perimeter Jacob Patrick whistled for his first Yeah Dames is very difficult to guard because hes got the ball on the string Hes not looking down Hes keeping his head up but he just has so many changes of speed changes of direction Really hard to guard if youre defending that type of player Dayday Ames and he stepped on the end line Cal with a turnover Thats the only way you can defend him Theyve got a bounce line The extra defender Yeah And you force him down there because thats thats one way But you get him in the middle of the floor Theres not much you can do with Ames Fourth turnover by California cheering Obamate Abby way out top Freshman from Finland cheering Yeah Kells doing a good job now of just kind of getting their spot The runner rattles out for Obamate Abby Yeah did a much better job defensively that possession Dwan Campbell pull up jumper and TD Carr The kick out kept alive on the offensive glass The runner wouldnt go for Dwan Campbell Another Cal offensive rebound Carr down the lane Wild shot thrown up by Carr and its pinled around and Jacob Patrick controls for the youths Utah fortunate number of second chance opportunities just wouldnt fall for Cal Yeah Cal playing a lot of switching defense now Jumped inside up and under and it goes for James Aonquo Thats a good looking dishoff for two inside Thats a low the welltraveled AONquo whos been in West Virginia North Carolina Akan now Utah Yeah thats dotting the the map Rox Its a lot of laundry Milos Elich missing inside Another chance that Cal cant cash in and the rebound pulled down by Kendall Sanders for Utah Couple point blank looks for Cal Don McHenry too strong on the three and the offensive rebound in the corner lost out of bounds by Jacob Patrick and it belongs to Cal But Utah strong start on the road Wedged in there but to refocus Whats it like for a coach trying to get his team back down to focus on the task This might sound counterintuitive Roxy You got to get a little amnesia You got to forget about UCLA As good as they played you know you got to put that game in the back burner That that happened already Now you got to come back and get that same mental edge that same edge you had against UCLA and play with a with a with a chip on your shoulder Uh you know they got to start all over again Shot clock at 10 Heres Dewan Campbell in the lane Tough step back by Campbell Spins out Lee Dort on the offensive glass Hes swatted at the rim but a foul is called and its on James A Conquo of Utah and two free throws for Dort Well well watch a replay here and its a good job of Dor just battling inside Nice job of keeping alive and getting the foul line But you know again to your point Roxy I think if youre Cal you dont overthink this You got to come back in here and dig in defensively They have allowed Utah to come down and get some easy scores and some some scores You got to go back to the dominating defense that youve been playing the kind of defense you played against UCLA and you got to play that way against Utah And frankly in talking to Mark Madson the first practice after the UCLA game was not a good practice And thats predictable I I hate to say that Its you got you know theres going to be a little bit of a a let down Its not just the turkey that gets you a little bit fat and happy Its the win Uh its beating a ranked team and doing it with in front of a crowd But he jumped him and he he got after him a little bit Did you ever do that after a big win Absolutely Absolutely You have to You got to be tough Easier to get on players after a win than it is after a loss Believe me Corner three In and out And the miss from Kendall Sanders and a foul on Utah going for the rebound So So why is that Why is it easier to get out players when youre when youre winning Because you know that youre feeling good but you can you can bring them down and get out from theyre a little fragile sometimes when youre losing You dont want to get beat down too badly But I think you got a big win you can take them back down and and you know its got to come from your teammate and its got to come from the locker room Roxy the coaches cant come from the coaches You need leaders and theyve got veterans on this team that have got us that handle that in the locker room John Camden from deep three And speaking of veterans theres John Camden who I thought has gotten some big games from Cal this year Hes helped turn their games around Second three for Camden and theyve cut the Utah lead to two By the way the second foul on James Aonquo hes on the bench right now for Alex Jensen Shot clock inside 10 Terrence Brown and a foul committed by Nolan Dorsy who stumbled a bit and the first whistled on Dorsy is sending Brown to the line Well that was a good defensive possession until the foul But you can see John Camden I mean he comes off with screens You cant go underneath against John Camden Hes just too lethal And hes shoots with confidence He was the first guy on the floor today Roxy when we were here early this morning in between practices He must have been here a couple hours before his team took the floor for shootound Uh and we talked Sean and I talked He said Im I I feel I got to get my shots up I want to be in a rhythm One more for Brown cheering Already eight points Now give him nine And the junior from Minneapolis 77 foul shooter Again averaging almost 22 points a game Hes been a great addition to this Utah program that Alex Jensen has brought in TT Carr missing a three and Keanu Dah Another rebound for Utah cheering Daws trying to power his way inside Don Mckenry Nice hesitation move by Mckenry Wow that was a great look off because I the whole gym thought he was going back for the pass and he turned faked the pass and just scored it Big time move First points for Mckenry who averages 18 a game and a steal Terrence Brown racing up the floor and finishes with a spike Now Mark Madisons going to let to let his team play through this and get over the hump here Utah on a roll right now Largest lead for Utah Six straight for the youths Corner three Nolan Dorsy short and Daws rips down the rebound Corner three by Mckenry and Cal looking to push it with TT Carr Dorsy to the basket and it falls out for Dorsy and the rebound pulled down by Josh Hayes for Utah Keanu Daws lost his footing John Camden pushes Cal Potential threeon two Dwan Campbell three Nice to have DJ Campbell back They certainly needed that basket Cal struggling to contain Utah Big shot by Campbell cheering First made three of the season for Campbell after again missing the first six games Mckenry three answers for Utah He did that against Nolan Dorsy Thats a tough guy to score against Got him back on his heels stepped back and nailed the shot 27 points for Mckenry in that win against Old Miss and he went five for six from three Former JC AllAmerican transfer from Western Kentucky Lee Dort drop step Hook shot by Dort Well they need to go back inside to Dort because he could do some damage down low Hes an improved player Hes not afraid to post up and get some work done in the paint Terrence Brown leans in and Cal comes away with it Dorsy Campbell missed the transition three Lee Door chases it down for the Bears John Camden gets free Three Did that bank in Roxy I think that might have might have banked it from the corner Im not sure But either way counted Thats Camden with a big three who had just five against UCLA has nine already And a foul off the ball and its a whistle against California Were at a barn burner here You could see theres Brown on the breakaway with the with the jab with authority And theres John Camden from the corner And that ball was banked Rex I mean hes just been knocking down shots from the three Hes been getting out in transition Hes doing a great job of just getting scores but I mean hes done a good job just getting up and down the floor and beating their team Hes just a tough guy to guard Theres the steel and if you trying to stop him hell go up over the top of you to get two Tough tough kid Terren music Brown Uh hes made a big difference for his team You know Roxy Cals only down three I think theyre fortunate to be only down three music Theyve given up 14 points in the paint and theyve turned it over five times leading to 10 points So theyve kind of shot themselves in the foot but yet theyre only down three Utah with Brown on the bench Lets see where Alex Jensen turns for offense Uh Cals got their starters back in the game They hadnt been together very long this half Kendall Sanders now the baseline Turnaround jumper way off from Sadu Trayori Yeah all five Cal starters back together again Day Ames down the lane and hes swatted out of bounds 13 on the shot clock and a cow ball on the baseline Yeah its you know theyd really like to see Chris Bell I mean watch what hes done in the last six games He has just been on fire and has been very quiet yet this game But they need him to step up He was huge in his last game against UCLA Hes been huge after over several of his last games Comes in to Chris Bell and hes fouled going up and its on Josh Hayes of Utah Well sometimes you have to do that Roxy I mean if you can get to the line you can draw your defender I I I mean theyre putting the ball in his hands and if youre a good player it starts by coming off I think you put it in your best shooters hands and and you know hes just thats a good move He swung through and drew the contact Excellent move And by the way whos been lights out from the line Beat me to the spot And speaking of excellent how much better can you be than Chris Bell has been from the free throw line this year What My goodness What does he miss one free throw on the year Averaging 16 and 12 points a game The transfer from Syracuse his first couple of points tonight 27 for 28 Thats not bad 20 or more for Bell in three of the last four games Try to tie the game after Utah led by eight Such a pure shot And you know theres a lot of scouts at this game I know theyre looking at the potential of a 67 wing player that can score like he can and shoot it like he can Eight straight for Cal to tie it Inside five and a half minutes to go first half Sadu Triori into the key hangs draws contact and Sadu Trayori will shoot a pair first on Chris Bell Well Cals battled to come back and tie this game Now Utah is deciding theyre going to get aggressive as well against a really aggressive Cal defense and try to take it to the basket Thats smart strategy cheering Third annual ACC SEC womens basketball challenge begins tomorrow Auburn in Syracuse at 5 Eastern And Thursday night SMU takes on Arkansas Thats at 7 Eastern on ACC Network and the ESPN app Sadu Trey nails both Cal will be playing Missouri in the womens ACC SEC challenge While the Cow men will not be in that challenge this year They lost heartbreaker at Missouri last year And the rebound crowd by Obamate Abby for Utah A nice job defensively on the glass For Utah Utah coming off a win against an SEC team and Mississippi racing up the floor Justin Pippen and a tie game You got your hands full with Pippen and Ames because theyre so good If you try to cross over in front of them theyre going to put their hands out there and get some steals They can they can get steals Justin Pippen almost two steals a game Kendall Sanders underneath Missed the reverse and its pulled down by Lee Dort for Cal And thats what Lee Dort does He shores up the inside Makes it very difficult to go up and around and over him Justin Pippet Too strong on the three but gets the bounce off the heel of the rim Thats called homecourt advantage Repsy Big time break for Cal Theres Pippen with his hands Fifth three for Cal It was deflected Thats why there was no backourt violation And a foul Its a hold on Dayday Ames cheering Now you like Justin Pimpin How about watching what he can do He gets out on the break gets ahead of everybody The pack throws it down Now hes coming off the screen The soft touch up music up and down Justin Pippen back in the house of pain the land of mis zu Oh yeah Weve been there been there done that Its going to be a great great opportunity Uh but really you know what an exciting team You havent gotten out to see Charman and her team They they theyve got some players and they play high pace Two shots rather one and one for Oba Mate Abby and one more coming You know freshman from Finland Utahs done a pretty good job on the other end Roxy making sure Cal hasnt got to the line other than the threepoint play follow They put Bell to the line Cal hasnt gotten to the line So if youre guarding Cal youre coming out of that timeout Youre Utah Continue to play but you got to stop Cal Now Cals got the momentum going in towards the halftime Step back Justin Pippen thought about it He kept the pivot foot down Thats why it was no trouble Chris Bell in the key and a good box out inside by James Aonquo Thats good looking shot for Bell Thats a shot he can make Cal better job now in transition Five guys seeing the basketball getting it stopped cheering Jacob Patrick too strong on the three Chris Bell the rebound for Cal Cal also doing a pretty good job not giving up offensive rebounds now Chris Bell slides in and challenged by Obamate Now theyre saying he wins straight up Mark Madson doesnt think so Hes running conversation about that last call or non call The defense though by Abby Here he is cheering inside 10 to shoot and a whistle away from the ball and its a foul on John Candid of Cal his first Well heres the play Thats Theyre saying he went straight up and the contact if anything was initiated by Bell may not be a bad call You know its always you get emotional in these games There was some contact then it was a matter of who who initiated it One and one for Patrick a junior from Germany Although his dad John Patrick played for Mike Montgomery at Stanford in the late 80s early 90s and was on an NIT championship team for the Cardinal in 1991 This is the front end of the one and one Stays at this end with Cal Well Cals got a chance to open up this lead with two minutes to go Theyre they were down early pretty pretty big and theyve come all the way back now to take the lead Your Cal you want to either get to the foul line or try to increase this lead with a good high percentage shot and a hold off the ball Its on Patrick The second on Jacob Patrick Well theyre trying to look for Chris Bell and Chris Bells drawing fouls And if he can draw fouls uh thats good advantage scale as we mentioned his free throw shootings outstanding And I dont know if theres right now percentagewise anybody shooting a better team foul number eight on Utah Bell a one and one and one more for Chris Bell Cals been in the line now seven times Chris Bell five of those times Alex Jensen his first year as the Utah coach played for the legendary Rick Majeras A hell of a player and during his day former Mountain West Conference player of the year Absolutely And just really a smart player 69 threeman ahead of his time Off to a six and two start Deep three from Jacob Patrick And a swish for Patrick now No lack of confidence from Patrick Thats the second time hes drained a deep three Second three for Patrick Pulls Utah to within one Heres Chris Bell And he lost it out of bounds Well youre playing against Patrick If youre defending him you got to know that he gets a look He gets his feet set You dont want to overhelp against him That thats one guy you got to stay glued to Hes too too lethal from three Keanu Daws from the corner and Lee Dort the rebound for Cal Already seven rebounds for Dort Pippen straight on three Thats a rhythm jump shot for Justin Pippen Thats something he does Hes very calm with the ball Knows what he wants Takes what the defense gives him Gave him a three He took it for Cal Second three for Pippen Ball deflected Keanu Daw attacks And Daw throws it up Got it back And then a tie up It belongs to Utah Correction It belongs to Cal Cal Bald And watch Justin Pippen again You go underneath the screen against Justin Pippen Hes clever He said No I cant do that Im too good from three And he nailed that shot Theres his dad Scotty Pippen in the house paying attention to young young Justin Good company So Alex Jensen takes over a Utah program first year in the Big 12 last year in Utah 16 and 17 But it was a turbulent season with Craig Smith the former head coach being fired in late February and Josh Eert was named the interim coach and they lost in the first round of the Big 12 tournament to Central Florida and then lost in the first round of the Crown tournament to Butler as Cal attacks and theyre up six Well I dont know if that was a play call as much as it was a read but give John Canman credit He found Lee Dor when his man came in to help on the drive and he delivered cheering 4C differential Chris Bell the steal cheering and taken right back by Obamate Abby for Utah Keanu Daws steamrolls his way inside Offensive foul Thats the right call That was no question He lowered his shoulder and and charged But how about Lee Dor Theres the drive Lee Dor goes to the rim And heres the defense here of just you know getting ground Did a nice job defensively Now if youre Cal you can play for the last shot Second foul on Daws Day Ames penetrates down the lane Pull up Aes at the horn Too good Rox You put the ball in his hands Hes too good Watch what he does He gets you going one

second foul as Josh Hayes trying to gather underneath Yeah if Josh Hayes had a little more presence of mind hed have taken that up and gotten the shots Anytime you get crowded like that take it up see if he can get some free throws Terrence Brown who leads Utah with 11 Don Mckenry forced way out Mckenry pull up Got it He can do that from Don Mckenry He can really do that Hes done that now in the first half and hes starting the second half Thats a much needed basket for Mckenry and the Utes Second team all conference USA last year for Mckenry as John Camden too strong on the three and the rebound Terrence Brown for the Utes Now you cant blame John Camden the way hes shooting the ball Here is Mckenry Five on the timer for Utah Terrence Brown missed a three and the rebound Lee Dort already Eight rebounds for Dort Hes just automatic He cleans up the defensive glass Big time rebounder Shot clock down to seven Day Ames pullup jumper on the baseline Well challenged by Josh Hayes Might have got a piece of it Thats good Good defense in transition Pushing the step through and the layin Sadu Trayori Nice move That was a euro and a completion at the rim Mark Matson going to his bench immediately trying to make a substitution as he did in the first half to turn things around Jori with seven just over two minutes into the second half and Justin Pippen from deep Well the stats might tell you to go behind the screen Roxy I I would not go behind the screen because Justin Pippen will nail it and make you pay Cal 7 for4 from three They were 11 of 22 from deep in the win against UCLA Answering with a three Sadu Trayori for Utah Yeah Chris Bell relaxed just a little bit Thats all Trayori needed 41 threepoint shooter Trayori Jday Ames spinning falling away Well you could see

clock rolling down on Utah Terrence Brown five to shoot Drives Brown and it falls off Last touch by Utah Tough to finish Theres Brown turning the corner and you got to go up and around Nice job by John Cameron to avoid fouling just using his 68 frame Utah challenging that last call Yeah So they feel it was last touch by Cal as Alex Jensen checking with his bench So they are going to the monitor It is a challenge from Utah on whose possession it should be A smart move and usually rocks Now theres a guy in the bench who just is responsible like in the NBA for video and theyve got to have a guy that can see this You got to have a pretty good idea that its your ball cuz you lose a timeout if if its not your ball That looked like it went off at Lee Dort And the ruling on the floor was cow ball last touch by Utah I dont know We got to be able to overturn Its got to be overwhelming evidence to change it Cant be close Its going to be a tough one And that is part of the new rules in college basketball this year is the challenge from the bench You must have a timeout to be able to do it You get one challenge per game If youre correct you get the challenge back Well its the coachs challenge by Alex Jensen in Utah here off who touched it last Well you might think its not a big call Heres one more look one more replay You didnt see if the ball changed directions or not Its going to be a tough one Again to overrule its got to be overwhelming evidence I dont know if you can say that based on those replays weve seen Nixon in the middle of your screen On the left Michael Greenstein and Kell Miller on the right music Veteran crew Yeah they get a little bit complicated They talked about how many pixels there were in each in each monitor They thinking about coming over here We have less pixels Here is the rule One challenge per team If successful you receive a second but final challenge And you must have a timeout to be able to challenge And theres three officials Theres no ties Utah challenged the out of bounds As a result play stands Utahs charged a timeout Utah charged a timeout Deemed an unsuccessful challenge by Utah And by virtue of the challenge they have one timeout remaining Yeah at first it looked like Lee Dorne might have hit it but then it looked like it cleared his right hand So I think the referees made a good call Heres Justin Pippen May have gotten away with an extra step gets it back and draws contact as Josh Hayes left his feet How smart is Justin Pippen I mean he just plays with a a lot of poise Roxy Hes never really you know I mean he knows hes going to draw a foul Thats just smart Hes laying down he gets up presence of mind and he gets big fell up in the air and draws the foul Uh I mean thats just clever basketball Right in front of his dad who was a pretty clever player himself I might Justin Pippen really smart one of the not only better athletes and players but really understood the game and how to play was a champ Pippen nails both 75enter this year He has 15 Part of a balanced attack for Cal and the Golden Bears are 13 for 14 from the line Back the other way and a foul crouching into the stansion Sadu Trayori and its on Chris Bell of Cal his second 22 Chris Bell is second two number four Well theres you know Mark Madsons just wondering why is it that after a made free throw his guys cant get back Hes just you know theres been times this year hes been upset with his team with defense in transition As good as Cals been defensively if they would shore up that area cheering they would be just nails on defense But four guys got beat back in transition off after a made free throw Trayori now four for four from the line 11 points for Trayori Last year average six points a game at Iowa after almost 12 as a freshman playing for Manhattan cheering And he hits both 60 to 55 Cal Yeah Utah hanging around Cows led by as many as eight Back door for Pippen And a foul will get Pippen to the line Nice pass by Lee Dort Yeah Lee Dort Roxy has really stepped up his game I This is something he could not do a year ago Theyre trusting him to make plays as like a forward a point forward And he was able to pinpoint pass to Justin Pippen who was being overplayed in the back door for a foul That will not go as an assist for Dort should But it should Yeah I agree with you We agreed Put that on tape Oxy Bernstein Ben Bronn agree What 832 pm Pacific time December 2nd Okay No but youre right I mean that should be assuming that the shooter hits the free throws That should also because his pass led to a basket led to points Exactly They should rewrite that rule cheering Shot clock at 10 cheering Zadu Trayori Nice pass inside Keanu Daws the finish for Utah Yeah speaking of good passes that was a great feed a great cut to the basket for the shirt to Utah still not going anywhere Dah who grew up a huge Utah fan now living on his dream playing for the running youths Lee Dort backs his way in Lee Dort with eight Too much rocks Too much confidence Lee Dort knew he had a oneonone matchup Knew where to go Got to his left shoulder and scored it easily No answer Terrence Brown Pull up at the elbow Short The rebound Lee Dort Rebound number 10 for Dort And Nolan Dorsey doing a nice job defensively on Terrence Brown Heres Justin Pippen Drives Pippen the finger roll Largest lead of the night for California And its Justin Pippen again with the shirt too I mean hes just steady Freddy out there on the floor making big play after big play cheering Cals made it much more difficult for Terrence Brown since that hot start And cheering a foul A grab on Cal inside Yeah Mark Madson doesnt like that call Pippen is second Second on Justin Pippet Not going to change it but Cals defense turning it up a notch here Really stepping up defensively Utah not an easy team to guard by any stretch of imagination Alex Jensen and his staff do a nice job but Cal really digging in defensively Team pound number five on the Bears cheering Kendall Sanders corner three Nice patience by Utah Really did a nice job Cal defending well and Utah waiting till the shot clock expires to nail two First points for the freshman whose dad played in Berkeley years ago for George Ringling at USC Dad Yaman Sanders part of a strong team that baby Jordan Harold Miner Robert Pack cheering Dayday Ames spins all the way around and goes well he owns that rim That was no doubt he was going to go down finding every kind of way to score Date Ames 19 for Ames to lead all scorers at the rim and the tip up over everybody Keanu Roxy I thought that was going up in the press box and he went up coralled it and just guided it into the basket What a what a catch Five youths in double figures tonight And a hold way out top as Terrence Brown picks up his second You like Dayday AMS all day day Watch what he can do I mean he gets to the basket splits two guys and decides just to work Theyre minus two but theyre still executing well and 56 from the field in this Yeah but those stats dont lie And Jason Armeno our stat producer on top of it as usual But thats he went and dug up some pretty good stats Roxy if youre coaching thats good to know that your teams got that in their bag Here is John Camden backing his way in Falling away and the rebound there is James Aonquo for Utah That would have been a big basket That would have extended to eight Now Utahs still hoping to chip away with a two possession game cheering Jacob Patrick from deep and a foul going for the rebound and its on Milos Elich of Cal whos in disbelief Well that was a front box out A lot of times you get called if you dont box out with your back but you box out in with and with the front of your body you get called I believe thats what happened Lets see it Yeah he just pushed off with his with his front part of his body Now its Dayday Ames Thats his fourth foul with 629 to go Now thats significant You if youre Mark Madson and Cal I I I dont know You might want to get Dayday Ames out and Anthony Reie jumps off the bench to tell Coach Madson Hey youre best guy right now Hes got four They may want to sit him Well see cheering Or do you trust your player You can go either way I was a little conservative with a player like Dayday if especially if we were had the lead If it was close or were behind hes got to play First point of the second half for Terrence Brown and Brown now with 13 tonight and the Cal lead is four Yeah they they may even end up going back zone to protect I wouldnt be surprised to see Mark Matson switch into free zone How surprised you that he left him in You know its just Mark Madson Hes trust his players and and so you know I I think thats a good sign that that day is not going to pick up an offensive foul probably and he wont get the foul on the offensive end but hes hes a liability then defensively because if youre Utah you go with him try to get his fourth foul fifth foul or you just get an easy basket Hes not going to foul you Sixth team foul in Utah third on James Aonqua And and believe me Alex Jensen knows that Hes an NBA you know guru and hell know that Dont know that concept Theres Dayday with the ball in his hands Pippen tough shot and its pulled down by Kendall Sanders for Utah Heres Don Mckenry and Ames with four fouls guarding Brown Heres Brown They want to give him some room to go at him there Now the switch off Deep three way off from Brown And the long rebound Last touch by Utah Yeah I was surprised that Utah brought a screener up Roxy They had the mismatch the isolation and this the switch and the screen allowed a different defender to get up on Brown inside 5 and 12 minutes I think Alex Jensens telling his coaches and his team the same thing Heres Pippen Got it Well thats just a pro move So I mean thats right in front of his dad Its that step back rhythm shot You get a guy at the rhythm you step back and you get your shot off Big time shot by Justin Careerhigh 21 for Justin Pippen Theres a mismatch against Ames Ames let him go Heres Patrick in the lane and he gets the roll Crawls in Well again that was set up because Day Ames did not want to pick up his fourth Basically played a little bit of Olay defense and let him drive it 13 off the bench for Jacob Patrick Back door for Pippen and its last touch by Utah and Don Mckenry Utah looking around like they wanted to challenge it Feeling was off Cal but they are out of challenges from an unsuccessful challenge about 5 minutes ago And speaking of challenge they better get somebody out there to challenge Justin Pippen Hes hes having a game Roxy had a slow start but hes been a big part of the second half comebacks for Cal Hes always seems to turn it out in the second half Starting guards have combined for 40 of Cals 70 Pippen from deep off of the three and the rebound pulled down by Sadu Trayori for Utah Yeah Utah fortunate they went behind the screen and Pippen cheering shot it just missed it Brown turns the corner corner left open and a three missed by Don Mckenry and its a foul going for the rebound on John Camden his second Yeah nice job of pause getting to the basket there One and one for Keanu Daw This Utah team is gritty Roxy Theyre theyre hanging tough and theyre giving Cal all they can give him They theyre showing you a lot of metal here Chris Bell returns for Cal Daws 12 points tonight along with a team best nine rebounds and five assists for Keanu Daws cheering Two for two from the line 71 on the year And one more for Daws The native lived in Salt Lake City till he was about seven Then he moved to Houston went to Rice as a freshman Now back in Salt Lake City his grandparents growing up had Utah basketball season tickets His grandma still has them Nice luxury Roxy A guy that can average double double Not many guys in the country do that And he does Inside 10 to shoot in a twopoint game Pippen drives Pippen glides in Lays it up and in Well I said there was no answer for D You better better put Justin Pippen in that same category They cannot contain Justin Pippen 23 now for Pippen cheering Sadu Trayori down low and the floater by Sadu Trayori Again Utah just hanging in I you just wonder can Utah get the stop they need Cal really proving to be a hard team to defend to turn this around But at the same time Cals having trouble getting stops when Utahs got the ball Utahs showing you something Day Ames Here is Chris Bell And a foul will get Bell to the line And thats the fourth on Jacob Patrick Twopoint game inside Three to go Well Justin Pippen having his way now just when they need him Hes able to get to the basket to the rim All the way to the basket Lay it up Cal by two But what else does he do for his team Averages almost two steals a game And hes their leading shot blocker Justin Pippen as a guard So hes doing a lot and and you know the assists five almost five a game Uh hes given this team a real lift Chris Bell short on the free throw He had missed one free throw all season coming in Hes missed two tonight No 96 rocks Thats highly unusual for this young man He gets the second now Seven for nine from the line Theyll make a substitution They go to Dwan Campbell and Day Dams again trying to stay out of fouling out Trying to avoid that fifth foul Ball knocked away by Pippen Reeves dives for it and an alternating possession It belongs to Cal Yeah Last hands of Pippen Knocked it free Yeah Last thing you want to do is turn it over But its Pippen again that just is able to not allow you to cross and get split That Cal works so hard in their ball screen defense They come together They dont let you split They make you go out Textbook coverage on the on the ball screen defense John Camden down low to Lee Dort Jump hook in the key rims out and a foul going for the rebound Thats the third on Dort Yeah good call Roxy but Dorton missed the shot and Lee Dorton you know got got a little too aggressive went over the top and fouled And so now youre going to put Utah at the line that can narrow this lead Heres the miss And now you go right over the top Theres no question that was a foul call The right call by the Fish One and one for Keanu Daws Four for four from the line Terrific allaround game for Daws tonight Too strong and John Camden clears for Cal Well both teams missing some free throws that could really make this an advantage for the team that knocks them down Pass broken up and stolen Kendall Sanders ahead for Utah Don Mckenry at the top and the rebound Theres Camden but he lost it out of bounds Yeah two guys fighting for the ball Roxy Leadport John Camden both did a good job Just couldnt hold on to it Boy you hate to see that but thats a good sign You got two guys going for the basketball Just unfortunate Got to grab it instead of reach with one Utah has a chance ball down three Has a chance to narrow it and tie it with a three cheering cheering Shot clock down to five cheering Kendall Sanders corner three Too strong and the rebound Lee Dort Thats a big rebound Cal now minute and a half to play They got to take their time Back door for Pippen Left it short Here comes Utah Don Mckenry ahead for Brown Up and under Terrence Brown Scoop shot wouldnt go Pip in the rebound out of the pack for Cal applause Thats twice now Utah hasnt been able to narrow it down A missed free throw and a missed layup Here is Ames 10 on the shot clock Ames spins Ames to the bucket Ames will shoot two Yeah its a dilemma when youre guarding Day Ames I mean theres the ball handling and the spin to the basket Euro threw and draws the foul Really really hard to defend Day Ames oneonone Two shots for Ames Rattles the first one in 80 foul shooter Two for two at the line tonight 20 now for Ames His fourth 20point game of the season Well if youre Utah you got to get on the board cheering and or draw a foul Cant come away empty cheering cheering cheering on Mckenry forced way out applause Yanu cheering tend to shoot Mckenry cheering blocked by Pippen Picked up Triayor McHenry shot clock violation Utah Thats just great defense by Cal and theyve done that to Roxy the last several possessions cheering My goodness thats just really good oldfashioned defense I mean theyre staying down Theyre defending the ball screen cheering Theyre rotating back to their man Theyre talking and not allowing anybody to get cheering movement to the basket Just really good job staying glued And theres your leading shot blocker Justin Pippen with yet another shot blocker Last time to play the foul game You probably not going to come up with the ball Cals got some very good ball handlers but the problem is Cals also a very good free throw shooting team Utahs had a drought of over three minutes at the wrong time Jday Ames and hes fouled by Sadu Trayori Yeah you just theres nothing you can do I mean I dont care if its day Ames Justin Pippen uh Chris Bell now 90 still that hes missed some shots You dont have a lot of options and you cant let time go off the clock He almost got a foul right away But Cals come back Roxy and they made some great offensive plays but its their defense that really in my opinion settled this game down the stretch They got stop after stop after stop One and one for Ames Team foul number nine on Utah And Ames three for three from the line tonight And one more coming for Day Ames Coming up for the Bears Theyre back at it on Saturday right here against Pacific And a heavy slate of home games in his long home stand upcoming Mark Madsons team No place like home And Ames makes it a three possession game Terrence Brown darts to the basket lays it in Utah out of timeouts Terrence Brown timeout use Yeah theyre saying that they music had no timeouts No theyre saying theyre saying that there is a sub Theyre not allowing the sub to take place here Lee Dor still in the game wanted to get Dwan Campbell in the game but Lee Dort has to stay in Well Utah cant music allow any time to go off the clock Its got to be a foul maybe away from the ball You got to stop the clock Roxy 9 10 seconds to go And a foul called as Cal got it in trying to spread it out I Terrence Brown and a foul committed by Utah Theres 79 to go Double bonus two and the Utah foul is called on Terrence Brown His third double bonus two shots for Days Well you see again the danger of fouling Cal at their guard position Theyve got guys that are really steady with the ball They can knock down their free throws Thats how you win basketball games One more for Ames Season high tying 25 for Day Ames Don McHenry threepointer blocked Thatll do it So Utah who had beaten Cal six straight times and the Bears win against Utah for the first time since January of 2021
