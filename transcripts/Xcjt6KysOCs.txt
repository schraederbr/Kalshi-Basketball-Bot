its the school where his mom was a star basketball player and his twin brother has just committed to for next year the Blue Devils and their home whites have their the the ball first lob to the rim one of the other stared freshman trying to involve him in that screen and roll K on malawat he along with Khan kiple and Cooper flag three of the top 10 freshman in in the country and youve got the veteran back court Caleb Foster Tyrese cter that foul was on keelen Steel of the black bears tell you what P canle from the moment he showed up in June on campus has shown hes a dude well hes a lottery Pick and his shooting is his best attribute but he shows you there if youre going to close out which you have to I mean you cannot leave him hes also physical enough and good enough to put it on the flooor and take it all the way to the rim in Dukes two exhibition games kiple was nine of 17 to illustrate your point Chris Dukes defense causing trouble Proctor knocks it out of bounds shot clock at 37 there you see the uh thirdyear head coach at his Alma moer John shy Now 37 years old and he has his name in some good company what a start to his head coaching career Applause Ms got to put it up Kellen TIs able to get rid of it but it a stop for the Blue Devils Dukes defense in their man was much more active against Arizona State they have such versatility I mean theyll switch one through four with the lineup out there now they have really good length flag is fouled and similar to John Shire Chris markwood in his third year back at his alma mater Chris is from South Portland played a couple of years at Notre Dame before transferring back home to play at Main flag puts it on the deck Mal hes got a lot of skills for a man who has not been playing basketball for very long and is only 18 years old able to catch and put it in with the shooting gravity with the with how well Duke has shot it you know hes going to have an open basket hes just got to roll to that Rim roll hard and catch it off the bounce Keon Burns no malawat Up Above the Rim for the rebound and hes been a monster on the glass in their first two exhibition games 23 rebounds in both of those nine of them offensive there was was the first steal of the night for the twotime reigning America East conference Defensive Player of the Year Kellen tis his name came up repeatedly during shoot around this afternoon for Duke and their coaching staff tis is number one Jaden Clayton also their point guard very good for Maine turnover forc Duke gets it back second turnover committed by the black bears there is times a grad student from Dartmouth Nova Scotia who began his college career at Montana State and has been part of the building for Chris markwood this main team coming into the Year Chris picked fourth in the America East thats the highest they have been seated in the preseason in 13 years Foster had it poked away Clayton into the Applause lane TI with the pull up m still looking for its first points of the season and they come on the putb by Ken steel the Junior from Ontario they play a rotating you know threeheaded monster at their bigs ke and steel starting this game a guy whos really battled injuries his red shirted the last two years once again flag to malat well I think were getting a sense of what makes Cooper for flag at 69 so valuable he may not lead the team in scoring but he is going to stuff that stat sheet well he has led Duke in assists in their first two exhibition games I think he could lead them an assists over the course of the year that four five ball screen that ball screen with Cooper flag and malawat in that case is really tough to guard because of that versatility youre talking about you know with flag and kiple the ball always seems to end up where its supposed to go when they have it foul on Caleb Foster his first klian griin has come into the game for Applause Maine Clayton just caught the front iron fight for the basketball comes to main tell you what the black bears have come to play the Layin by Keon Burns oh just keeping possessions alive offensive rebound on the last possession there broken play theyre able to scoop Applause up very nice the black bears have tied things up on the turnaround by Burns Keon Burns spent two seasons at Liu came to Main last year he finished the year really well what a move by Caleb Foster plus the Applause foul well Caleb Foster because of his foot injury did not start working out until July and then he has been moved to that point guard position and has done an exceptional job I mean he advances the ball on their Breakin transition better than anybody and then hes that one guy who can put it on the floor hes very Shifty when he gets into that paint and a very good catch and shoot player he hes a very important piece for them with the guys around him hes that table setter they need how do you see he and Tyrese proor terms of who handles the basketball this year for Duke I think Tyrese is going to be off the ball I think he has handled it well the backup for Caleb has been cion James early I think youre going to see Cooper flag just talking to John sh a little bit I think youre going to see Cooper flag at the point at times this year one of those veteran transfers who is so valuable Mason Gillis the former Purdue boiler maker has his first two points in a blue Devils uniform theres that movement off the ball you know something John really wanted John shy when they went to that five out offense it gives him you know that motion away from the basketball Malik Brown the Syracuse transfer number six in white also out there coming off the bench for Duke TI got an open look here comes Cooper flag The Freshman from Newport Maine and hes fouled no basket foul came before the shot and he will head to the line after the break with a chance for the Blue Devils Music Music Music it to start lets see what you got e e e lock in on Shooters on the opposite side its just you know its easy basketball good set and all 10 of Dukes paint points so far Doug coming from that paint there you one of those transfers Mason Gillis coming over from Purdue played in that national championship game last year coming off to their bench with great experience Ill tell you what Chris coach sh and his staff couldnt have gone to Central Casting to round out the roster any better than he did with the graduate student seon James from tane Mason Gillis who weve seen from Purdue add in Malik Brown from Syracuse talking to coach shy this afternoon about them he said theyve got no for themselves kiple is fouled from behind meaning they have established themselves at this level at the college level and they have come to do with the idea of doing whatever they can whatever role that is to help the Blue Devils win games well their two best players by far its not even close so far have been Cooper flag and K canle and by adding those three guys you mentioned Doug like those are culture guys those are locker room guys those are are guys who have a lot of experience and I think what those two those three guys have really embraced is making flag and kiple better get those guys easy shots make life easy for your two best players and thats not to say that these other guys arent going to get theirs but canle and flag have to be the priority and the great thing about canle and flag is youre going to get that ball back because of how unselfish those two guys are so youre right I mean you hit it right on the head John was very targeted in who he went out to get to complement their two best players after the lane violation kipple gets a couple of free throws six unanswered points for Applause Duke off the screen Christopher mantis who was brought into this main program to do just that this season he sure was made 49 threes last year on a very good app State team on rebound comes to kiple who attacks six quick points for the Freshman from Milwaukee there was a foul that led to the turnover Chris markwood I dont blame Applause Music him but there he is I mean hes just all over the place he always finds the ball K canle hes a guy who grew up playing in a mens league in Wisconsin and you can tell he is not afraid of contact hes always on the offensive glass and always around the basketball well even though that shot rimmed out the fact that Christopher mantis got another open three will not please the Duke coaching staff that was a big part of the Scout earlier today k k nickle he had 19 against Arizona State in the exhibition hes picked up where he left off nine already Chris just an easy release he is an elite Music shooter flag the steel and immediately fouled by Novak perovic and I think John shy is having a you know a good time getting him him shots and again thats where like Malik Brown setting that down screen thats working to get your two best player shots and then theres the competitor you know theres the warrior spirit that Cooper flag plays with nice job being alert off the ball making a play in the passing Lane you know what when you watch shoot around you watch practice warmups whatever this young man who is fouled before the shot is yet to Applause score impacted things in the first 6 and A2 minutes assist to his credit you can see on his face Chris if he misses multiple shots consecutive shots hes irritated hes not happy hes a throwback you know his game and and how hard he plays is his bravado he doesnt say a lot his unselfishness his giving of himself is his swag you know its just its really refreshing the way he goes about his business its understated a little bit old school and to see that I mean remember hes only 17 years old he doesnt turn 18 until December so its its not just his talent its his approach that makes him just wise Beyond his years so after the one and one that was the seventh team foul on Maine Cooper Flags first two points as of Blue Devil come from the free throw line and there is the defensive Menace that is Malik Brown can nipple count the basket in one a champ for Applause Music four KH can nipple is a dude hes a dude hes a lottery pick but it starts with the defense like you said Malik Brown is a deflection steel master and then as we said a nose for the ball he is always around the basketball is K kiple an elite shooter foul number two on Jaden Clayton and it is indeed a fourpoint play for kiple its now 11 unanswered points for Applause Duke Clayton able to keep that pivot foot Applause five in the shot clock Dukes defense again inspired forcing a tough shot up against the buzzer by grien a malow watch and that been two different types of ball screens there just doing a masterful job he switched then he was in drop Gillis from K the Duke run makes it 269 Blue Devils Music walking Flor our very own dancing dou lets go Applause Music Applause and in talking to Cooper earlier today he said growing up when they played oneonone Cooper says he would win nine out of 10 oneonone matchups with his twin brother Cooper says that Cooper says it and acknowledges that quite likely Ace would have a different story but they are different type of players ace is more of a forward Cooper more of a wing coming out of the timeout the black bear snap the 140 Applause run Proctor creates some space follow up the offensive rebound cion James and the former Tain Green Wave misses his first shot as a blue devil and here comes Maine M from behind out the block but the black bears keep coming Jaden Clayton with his first bucket of the season and a broken play bucket by Maine but how about the activity on both ends for malawat hes all over the place all over the offensive glass setting screens high and blocking shots on the other end terrific ball movement to find can nipple open in the corner about the first thing he has missed tonight 13 points to lead all scores half of Dukes points Clayton with consecutive baskets its back to a 10point game just that open side pick and roll coming off and and as you said earlier those two guards Jaden Clayton and Kellen tin are the foundation for this main program experienced guards hwatch with a bad pass taken away by Clayton Applause well in the America East conference Vermont again this year the team to beat but the black bears are expected to be able to compete noack perovich the senior from Serbia with the runner back to an eightpoint game thats nine on answered points for the black bears coming out of that Applause timeout P nipple malawat Pro got Applause it best thing Tyrese Proctor does is Catch and shoot and that was a good shot off of the offensive rebound nice job finding the open shooter the Proctor at times shot selection can be an issue hes the one guy on a very unselfish team that stands out as hes constantly hunting his shot do you think Proctor will be better than the 35 he shot a year ago I do as long as theyre those types of Applause shots Applause kiple a carry turning it Applause Music over Cooper flag back in still looking for his first made basket Isaiah Evans another one of the highly touted freshmen hes from fville North Carolina out of North mecklinburg Number 15 recruit in the ESPN 100 a year ago he makes his Duke debut number three in Applause white Caleb Foster back into the game playing defense out front for Duke proor tries to cut off Clayton who pulls up but misses board grabbed by Applause Evans Foster drives gets the defender in the air and lays it through thats where those drives they open up cuz again youve got to stay home in a corner on the shooter a nice job driving the ball to the basket finishing and they spent a lot of time working with their guards on finishing around the basket tough step through shot by AJ Lopez was an air ball Foster trying to make him pay Applause personal foul going to go against Isaiah Evans and will take us to break on opening night at Cameron Indoor the Blue Devils Le by Music 13 e te for e after Kaman malow watch is putting him in ball screens youve got that open corner Duke has Mal watch and drop coverage and theyve spent a lot of time you know trying to get him a little more assertive using that 75 wingspan Doug to be a little bit more active but thats the one area where they have struggled so far in their exhibition schedule and in this game I think theyre going to see a steady diet up 72 250 lb out of the NBA Academy Africa program he committed to doke relatively late but what an addition he W is and will be for Coach shyers star sted recruiting class rated number one in the country Kellen TI on the turnaround with his first two points those two guards ties and Clayton have done a nice job playing off the two feet theyre getting to their spot using a pivot they know shot blockers are coming flag pulls up off the back iron Foster after the rebound but it comes to Keon Applause Burns 12 to Applause shoot carry able to get the shot up on the rim just didnt get the roll Foster steps into a three left it short long rebound grabbed by Kell THS turned around by Lopez with the Cameron crazies chanting airball every time he touches It Foster hangs in the air kicks to the corner the triple around and out on the stick back the first made Basket in the Duke career of Cooper flag give him four points on the night nice job with the advance again Caleb Foster getting into the paint nice kick out to Evans and then youve got guys attacking the offensive Music glass foul on Evans coming up next number nine North Carolina host Elon will wrap up theight with the nothing but net crew at 11 Eastern a way to tip off the season right here on accn and the ESPN app be interesting to see how reigning ACC Player of the Year RJ Davis gets his Fifth and final season as a tar heel Applause underway tell you what Keon Burns Is Not Afraid oh hes not again in their last six games you know he was almost a 5 4090 guy he hit a great finish to the Applause year Burns is a 66 senior from White Plains New York and as you mentioned Chris hes an Liu transfer his six points lead Music main good position inside and patience for Ken steel his second made basket for the thirdyear black bear and hes got the underdogs back within nine bosto Here Comes Maine trying to push the Applause tempo nice job to step in from the weak Side by Gillis thats the sixth turnover but given right back Kellen tis will head to the free throw line main has done a nice job when theyve got in the pain not panicking theyve used their pivot foot weve seen this fade away from a few different guys here tonight and then a nice job here again by kelen Steel know hes got size over the top at 610 just taking his time oneonone when Maine has taken care of it you know they have five early turnovers in this game theyve taken much better care of it down the stretch of this half theyve been able to get pretty good looks well Chris markwood has nine returning letter winners from a year ago and again this main team in his first two years have gotten better each year having won 15 a year ago the expectation is that will go up this year Kellen tin makes a pair after having been fouled by Mason Gillis flag attacks piple into the Lane talk about patience in the lane hes got that as well well Im surprised he didnt shoot it cuz he was open when he caught it but again you know that flag canle connection flag on the kick out the canle you know just the ability I mean he had a shot there but press is the issue and theres the physicality he just got a ready body spent a lot of time in a weight room hes really committed there 67 215 lbs foul was on seon James his first and the sixth against Duke here in the first Applause half its another main turnover and here comes cion James to the rim flag couldnt Coral it he goes into the front row as Maine dribbles back the other way and a stoppage Music well this building is just waiting to explode for the type of highlight that we know can come from Cooper flag well and my man seon James sold the clip you got to put that ball just in the vicinity of the rim and flag will get that one itll come well take a break as well from camera 3525 Duke Music Applause he Music Applause as first round AC WN time at 700 the Flor we are Music Music it Music seventh rank Duke up 10 on opening night here at Cameron Indoor Stadium with Chris pah Im Doug Sherman K kiple has been brilliant so far for the Blue Devils he has you know I just love watching he and Koopa flag play because of how they play I mean when your two best players do effortbased things you know when it starts there I mean think about how contagious that can be and thats where those two guys start like they impact the game even if theyre not scoring but they can both really get it going and its the versatility I mean kiple is an elite shooter but he has shown you his ability to put it down on the floor hes shown you ability to you know make a play off of a turnover hes an outstanding offensive rebounder its just contagious you know that with how hard they play and when its coming from two freshmen everybody else has to fall in line do you know where he came up with where they came up with his unusual first name I had to ask him today and what did he say he said that his fathers family is from near Conway Montana and his grandparents named his father KH because of that and then his father named H con so there are two k probably in the entire world both from the kifle family now you know now there you go breaking out your best stuff in game one how do you know its my best Kellen TI now with five the season is Young Ive done enough games to know what your best stuff is stuff is Applause St Here Comes flag throwing it down well thats what the crazies were waiting for here he is again number two with the Applause basketball James off the feed its another assist from Cooper flag and thats Cooper flag bringing it up in transition initiating the play and a beautiful skip over the top and thats the one guy on Dukes team you think you can kind of help off of but they all can knock it down well he was 38 a year ago at Tain hes a 1000 Point scorer with a Green Wave so I wouldnt give him too much space the volume of guys they have Applause Applause steel to the reverse nice job to keep the defender on his Music back two foot surgeries the last two years for steel has has had the red shirt both years so he hasnt played a lot of basketball but hes done a nice job on the interior for them in this first half flag he goes to the reverse starting to heat up hes got eight points well the expectation is that he could have the same type of impact on college basketball not just here at Duke but nationally that we saw a Zion Williamson a few years ago do you think that is possible this year for Cooper flight theres no question about it now heres the thing I mean Zion Williamson went to an elite eight Palo Ben Carol went to a final four so I think the Judgment ultimately is you know what do you do in the postseason but theres no question that he will have the impact as a talent Music Music Cooper flag out of nomus Regional High School grew up in Newport main about a 35minute drive from the University of main campus so his home state school and hes doing things like that against the black faar he just hes so good at putting it on the floor again in transition there out of the pick and roll they didnt even set it and obviously the length to finish hes a really good athlete the one thing itll be interesting to see Doug as the year moves on on you know shooting he is an improved shooter it is not certainly what he does best on those types of ball screens do you go underneath will we see teams going under with him will we see teams daring him to shoot sort of forcing him to that perimeter shot doesnt get the finger roll but there to clean it up Malik Brown the Syracuse transfer has his first two points of the year and you dont need to run a play for Malik Brown he doesnt even want for that to happen he is just in the right place at the right time all the Applause time with a minute to go in the first half the putback for the black bears and for Killian grien the Sienna transfer thats their sixth offensive Rebound in this first half its been a one problem area after that first shot its been a one problem area for Duke flag now old for three from distance hes got eight points three rebounds four Applause Music assists this offensive glass again six offensive rebounds another one of those you know off of two feet fall away and then gribbon just sneaking in there nobody putting a body on those bigs especially for Maine and you can tell John sh not pleased John shy this afternoon said he was fully expecting the black bears to come in here said theyre well coached team and he expected his team to get a good test and that is indeed what we have seen here in the first half its a much better test than Arizona State gave thats for sure Applause Applause Music flag with five on the shot clock got to put it up that does not count terrific defense once again by the black bears to force yet another turnover that is number seven committed by Duke Music and just you know nobody really aware of the clock I got perovich to trigger against the folklore pressure with 32 seconds to go in the Music half ties puts it Applause up performs with the sky blue lettering and white Trend B slapped away from Clayton flag then lost it back to Clayton good ball movement finding Burns open from three just sloppy from coopa flag sloppy from Duke in traffic there and another broken play that Mains able to take advantage of and a nice job sharing the basketball to find a quality shot Burns leads Maine with nine Proctor no malawat had a hand on it itll stay at this Applause end lets go Mains made a number of Scrappy plays theres the Poke away from flag and then nice play by Keon burns with that back flow coming from behind and a good extra pass to get an open shot Proctor nothing but net the Junior from Sydney Australia now with six points thats his shot catch and shoot doesnt have to be spectacular hes got got to be Dependable this year for Duke Helen tis just inside the threepoint line left it well short heres Khan canipa leads all scores with 15 Foster to flag looked like it might have been clean up top by Ken steel but hes going to pick up the personal foul his second and theres that wide pin down again that early offense Dukes Advance is so good and because they space those guys in those Corners you get that that pin down you get Cooper flag coming off you know he had four assists in the first half which means in five halves of basketball the two exhibitions in the first half Doug he has 13 assists in only one turnover hes going to lead them in that category this year I mean he just he draws so much attention with his size coming up the floor he can see over the top and as as we know his instincts and his feel are outstanding hes now got 10 points Chris who do you think for Duke is going to be the leading scorer this Applause season its a great question uh you know probably kiple would be my offering as Proctor picks up the foul from what weve seen so far they got a lot of dudes though you know I was sitting on on Friday at their practice with Brad Stevens the president of the Celtics who who was there watching and and the thing that stood out to him about them was just the number of guys and the interchangeability that they have and John shires done a great job with that they are in a really good Rhythm especially for this point in the year offensive foul drawn by flag personal against Clayton Music Applause I know that dont know if he just fell over Applause or either way its another black bears turnover flag with the basketball in hand Foster to the corner can nipple to flag but thats how Duke wants to play on offense right get it into the paint and then kick it out to an open shooter no question and the spacing allows them to do that and the unselfishness malaw didnt need to block it just his mere presence but then on second effort kayn steel with a chance for three well you talked about the injuries that have kept kelen steel from playing he had a careerhigh four points against eain Augusta two years ago a division three opponent hes come into Cameron here tonight is already into double figures and hes perfect from the field he hasnt missed a shot hes been very active on the inside hes hes been physical and thats the one area you know when you talk to Chris we talked to Chris markwood today they have really experienced guard nice Bank job there really experienced guards their wings are athletic and he likes their physicality and skill up front his game was tied at six Duke went on a run and has maintained a double figure lead for the most of the rest of this game Mok will head to the line to shoot three he is number eight on Jonathan gons latest NBA draft Big Board which has Cooper flag number one k can nipple number Applause Music six that is the fourth personal foul on keln steel which seems to be inevitable having to do all of what he is asked to do and yes that is a left glove that malawat is wearing for the foreseeable future to protect his hand hes got a minor hand injury and so we saw in both of the exhibition victories and then during practice and shoot around he continues to wear in the game here tonight coach sh though says it doesnt impact his play has not hurt him but he wouldnt mind seeing it come off somewhere down the road cuz that would mean his hands feeling better Applause klian gribbon Off the Mark here comes Cooper flag with a full head of steam likes the match up backing down Big Time Well when youve got Kellen tins at 63 trying to hang with that big man its going to be tough to keep from getting to where he wants to go well somebodys caught got to come over and get his back youve got to get the ball out of flags hands but how about the patience I mean two or three spins got to his spot played off of two feet right over the top thats 12 points tonight for Cooper Applause flag flag gives it up then goes to set the screen rejected by Foster right down the lane missed the shot and then the rebound went off his hand and out of bounds no either flag brings it up or throw it to him early in transition cuz hes trailing the play often times and like you said Doug you got the match up nobody comes over to help Kelling times I mean at that point you have got to get the ball out of Cooper flags hands but again with the shooting gravity of Duke and the number of Shooters they have youre just everybodys reluctant to leave their guy Applause five on the timer Burns puts up a tough Applause shot Malik Brown off the Duke bench early here in the second half flag Works to the Baseline finds can nipple in the opposite corner for three its a great pass from flag not good defense you cannot leave K canle like you have got to stay in his pocket he is too Elite a shooter for you to be ball watching not expecting and this again a highle pass but Jaden Clayton what are you doing my man Music Music e e Applause country music royalty here at Cameron Indoor Stadium tonight Zack Brown at the Zack Brown Band sitting right behind the Duke bench you just never know when you come to Cameron who you going to see Chris you know I like my chicken fried cold beer on a Friday night Doug how about you I do I had the chance to see him in concert down in Tampa this past spring Fabulous As Always Duke is on a 70 run matching its largest lead of the night at 17 Applause good close out by flag to make that a tough shot for Keon Burns James Proctor Brown flag theres James off the bounce from last years Defensive Player of the Year in the ACC the other thing Malik Brown does really well hes a very good passer you know hes very good out of that short roll out of the pocket top of the key like he was there just got a good feel as a passer Clayton pulls up little strong flag with another rebound and hell bring it up himself six rebounds now for the freshman in his debut well theres the strength of James when you look at him you understand he can make plays like that yeah like you said thousand points score in his time at tan doing a lot of that you know Duke really hasnt had a guard with his size not many football teams have had players with his size well we talked to Coach sh earlier today about the three key transfers he has coming off the bench Kellen TI with the basket I said is this the template for Duke basketball going forward where you bring in the elite freshman and then surround them with veteran transfers and he said yes but no he would love to not take as many transfers necessarily hed like them to be homegrown as possible Brown has it rattled out but he was not complaining at all he is thrilled with the way they Spilled Out the roster this year using as many transfer spots as they have flag with another rebound and hes fouled in the back court and thatll take us to break the debut of flag going well for the seventh ranked team in the country Music St Music e Music welcome back to Cameron this five out offense for Dukes really tough to guard because of the spacing John Shire puts his two best players in the corner this baskets wide open you just get a little screen here and then a slip to the basket by seon James you cant leave the corners cuz of whos there and then that basket dug is wide open and thats thats the Rhythm that Duke is in right now offensively and you know you credit John Shire the job he and his staff have done a lot of it has to do with their personnel too I mean you just got a lot of guys who have a really good feel high IQ for the game so flag and kiple understood that the slip was coming and they knew to stay out of the way or its their responsibility you know being in the corners and then know seon James has that option to slip off of that that little screen James turns it over second half shooting Duke starting to seize control fully 60 since the break Maine shooting only 27 since the break Applause Clayton guarded by James Music Applause gribben prer flag and James around the perimeter Gillis back in along with Malik Brown heres flag spins around the defender and an offensive fou he hooked the defender with that elbow thats personal foul number one on Cooper Music flag yeah I mean by Applause rule so youre saying you didnt like it I mean how you look if Im Jaden Clayton Im loving the B for sure Logan carry in the game a more Guard from Shelton Applause Connecticut to the left hand thats a nice looking move by Jaden Clayton give him six points for the Junior from Whitby Ontario and again its the back court for the black bears Clayton and TI that has Chris markwood and this main basketball team so looking forward to this new season picked fourth in the America East of course John Beckers Vermont catamounts the favorites once again this year but Maine continues to make strides under their thirdyear head coach and he is a black bear through and through a 2005 graduate former Captain Gillis on the back door pass and once again its brown with the perfect feathered bounce pass and another slip to the basket Applause Gillis does a nice job staying with the shooter Applause mantis Foster puts it on the deck draws the contact and puts it Applause Music through well Dukes offense is rolling they got a lot of dudes Caleb Foster little bump little bounce it falls Applause Music Music sad Music Music where watch to see if the Duke football team can come up with its seventh win of the year and how they deal with the terrific freshman quarterback of the wolf pack CJ Bailey multiple offensive rebounds for Duke Applause with Chris P Im Doug Sherman here at Cameron indor that time Malik Brown unable to hook up with the cutter this time it was Proctor and the ball goes out of bounds back to Maine 11th Duke Music turnover if youre on the Duke bench does that turnover not bother you quite as much no I dont think it does because its one of those of of commission you know it it was a tight window but so its certainly its a play that Malik Brown can make N9 minutes gone here in the second half what a spinning bucket and a chance for three by Logan carry I mean I dont know how he got it through that window I had to see it twice I mean just squeezing it through there as Malik Brown comes over what a finish the foul went against Foster his second nicely done by number zero in blue for Maine Logan carry it was an 11point lead at halftime the Blue Devils have stretched it out here in the second Gillis soaring in is James back to the corner the former boiler maker misses consecutive threepoint shots and the ball goes back over to main yeah we were talking to Chris markwood earlier today asked him is this your first time in the building he said no Ive been here one other time before I was an assistant at Vermont in 20134 they lost to Duke by one they had a shot I guess at the end of the game game it was that was the year that Duke had Jabari Parker and Rodney Hood so hes they when he was at BC as an assistant Duke I guess came up to play them so this is this is his second time in Cameron Indoor Stadium we talked about the fact that he is a former black bear himself his wife Ashley was also a star basketball player at Maine she has made the trip with her two daughters Caleb Foster lays it in Applause no whistle play continues after the Miss by revon tuich kiple comes to a stop and backs it in you know KH kiple was the help on that slip to the basket on the last possession down there he comes over makes a great defensive play and then ends up scoring on the other Applause Applause end whistle against Duke again heres this heres this play by kiple watch him come over he reads the play walls up and forces a miss you know those those two guys he and Koopa flag make you feel them and and on the other end nice job using his shot fake hes got that kickstand body but Im telling you man hes physical hes Applause tough well he was Mr basketball in the state of Wisconsin last year Wisconsin Lutheran High School team went 30 and0 to claim the state championship and he gets here to Duke and his teammate Cooper flag had gone 33 and0 and one a national title at mon B well they you know they have both been well coached I mean that thats where we were talking about Ace Flag and Cooper earlier like they were coached by a guy named Andy Bard who is a a main basketball legend coached by Andy from a young age and he coached them hard like they you know Cooper flag has been coached hard KH kiple has been coached hard and you see the result here goes kipple goes to the right hand hes now got 22 points Applause TI defended by Foster Foster tries to stay with him TI No look P but James was there waiting for it seon James will head to the line to shoot two would you draw a charge or try to if seon James at 66220 was coming at you with a full head of steam I wouldnt step in and take a charge if it was you coming down are you crazy Id break in half he is Chris pah twotime scoring champion in the Patriot League during his days at army you were not leading the Patriot league in charges drawn I guess I was not or Music charges dra business decision right no you were too valuable at the other end of the floor oh I got a face for TV well that was the eighth steal of the night for Duke turning it into points at the other end James out of Sugar Hill Georgia with a couple of free throws hes had a real nice debut nine points Off the Bench tonight for Duke its going to do it and steel and if its steel that would be his fifth Music Applause yeah I like the call you know malow watch is impeding Applause and still trying to fight through Applause there so after a career night here at Cameron Indoor Stadium keelen steel sits down having foued out with 11 points but a terrific start to the season for the now healthy 610 Jr hes been replaced by Killian grien again 610 Jr from Ireland one on the shot clock and the whistle comes and a foul is called and Im not sure both officials saw that the same way the official out near the perimeter said that is a foul on Duke and that is the call that Music Applause stands yeah I I dont I dont know about that call I mean he puts his hand on him but obviously Burns was off balance to begin with and and then I I think kiple just kind of walls up yeah and I think the other official was going to call out of bounds and we didnt see a cylinder call by either official Keon Burns putting together a nice night here at Cameron give him 11 points he and steel share the lead for the black bears Khan kiple leads all scores with 22 Cooper flag has 12 in his debut James left it a little short fight for the ball comes to the black bears and the Blue Devils commit a foul in the back court it goes against K kmle and we will take a break after the Freshman picks up his second personal Music Jo Music know Music for e Music Duke basketball royalty in the house lalang 15 years in the NBA twotime Allstar and hes here because Kon malawat is one of his Kon has been mentored by his fellow South Sudanese basketball player and so L all back and checking things out if we go back to that shot the Buddy sitting next to lual dang is actually wearing a shot of lual when he was a Duke Blue devil and I dont know why Chris mola is not wearing a Doug Sherman shirt right now thats what friends are for right there its on layaway I wanted to wear it tonight they put it on layaway theyre a hot item what would you be doing in that shot making a shot of course I can get you one oh man well malawat wears number nine because thats the number Lu alang wore in the NBA he wore number two while he was a dookie Applause this week ACC huddle starts the day at a special time of two Eastern from Acure stadium in Pittsburgh with a 90minute pregame show leading into Duke NY State at 330 and then theyre back at 630 to wrap up the afternoon with highlights and Analysis and to get you set for Virginia pit at 8 after the game stay right here on accn for a full postgame show to wrap up tonight and well see how Eli Holstein at the pit Panthers bounce back from there lost to SMU Music Flag Drive and dish to nipple Applause Music Applause no Clayton keeps the dribble Rons pants knocked away here comes Cooper flag flying high how many times have we seen flag in the passing Lane tonight anticipating using that length hes a wonderful combination of not just the physical gifts but the mental gifts and fundamentals having the proper hand in the passing Lane to come up with it keep it in bounds and to be able to go the distance well he you know he competes hes hes in every play he hes trying to make the right play and its whats its what separates him to the left hand now for 16 Applause points propor grabs the long Applause rebound off the ball foul committed by Kellen TI its the whole package tonight for Cooper flag in that passing Lane shows you little flare at the end there and then just facing up mid post goes to work with the left flag is six of 13 for 16 points 0 for four from distance hes made his four free throws seven rebounds five assist couple of turnovers in 27 minutes and the numbers just keep going up for the 69 205lb freshman from Newport Maine and again its not a coincidence that this game was scheduled coach sh when we asked him earlier today said yeah it was kind of something we wanted to do to get Main and Duke together because of what the state of Maine and the people of Orono really do mean to the flag family and again his mom was a star player on a dynastic womens basketball program back in the 90s it do at uh main re his brother has just committed his twin brother race is going to be a black bear next year and so it just seemed to make sense all the way around to have Maine come here to Cameron and Maine has given them a good look tonight you know certainly a better look than the two exhibitions Dave Applause Music Duke timer under 10 flag pokes it away but hes going to be called for the reach in to the Chagrin of the crazies that is foul number two on flag and we talk so much about his offense his defense might be ahead of his offense right I mean he is such a good on Ball and helps side Defender he is first of all that was a foul despite John shs reaction but yeah I mean its hard to say his defense is ahead of his offense cuz his offense is is you know certainly at an advanced advanced state but but hes committed defensively which again you know there are a lot of things that really hyped talented anointed young players do not do effort commitment to defense these things youre talking about dog that Cooper flag does I mean he he sits down in a stance and and he is willing to defend and he alert off of the ball auster had it knocked away on the way up by Burns at the other end the foul committed by kiple and we will have free throws upcoming for AJ Lopez the senior from Queens New York out of Mount Zion prep in Maryland who began his college career at the University of New Hampshire Music well Chris the fall Seasons roll on and we have three more ACC championships for you right here on accn and the ESPN app our womens soccer coverage continues through the semifinals Thursday at 530 and 8 Eastern the field hockey quarterfinals begin tomorrow at 1000 am eastern and the mens soccer first round starts Wednesday at 6 and 8 accn is the home of ACC championships the ACC currently has seven teams ranked either number one or number two nationally including the Duke womens soccer team number one Clemson number two and the North Carolina field hockey team number two in the country youll get a chance to see them in their ACC tournament play piple gets his own Miss andll bring it back out a little more than 5 minutes remaining here on opening night at Cameron Indoor Stadium behind the back flag pulls up no Brown back out the flag F of about it Foster to Proctor spotting up well you said thats the best part of his game and now hes going to have a chance for four it is thats what hes got to be able to do hunt his catch and shoot you know I think hes been humbled by the last two years Tyrese Proctor you know guy that you know some thought maybe be a oneand done it certainly hasnt turned out that way you know he hasnt fought being off the ball they moved him off of the point hes not going to score his way into the NBA you hes got to be a guy good catch and shoot player three to1 assisted turnover and somebody who defends which hes certainly capable of doing hes now got 10 points three of four from Beyond The Applause Ark and youll remember Proctor got here young he was a reclassified guy and as an illustration of just how hard it is to play at this level especially when you have classed up foster rles homea three largest lead of the night for the Blue Applause Devils there is that effort on defense weve been talking about from Cooper flag yeah thats I I said in the open he plays the game with character this is what I mean you know the willingness to a defend and B dive on the floor for a loose ball that thats playing with a warrior spirit and when you combine that with Talent thats why if youre seeing him for the first time thats why Cooper flag is special and it permeates through the roster if your best player plays like that the other guys are going Applause to five on the shot clock Applause Lopez not sure he beat the buzzer but they let the play go on after the Miss well weve got all three of the transfers out on the floor right now for Duke Brown kicks it out to James to Gillis heres Proctor and again that Trio of guys Cooper flag is down on the floor at the other end of the court and in some Music pain will step away as they work on that left leg of coop flag Music Music Music Music I go Music Applause out Music as we went to break the 9300 here at Cameron Indoor Stadium were holding their Collective breath as Cooper flag went down yeah and all signs you know looks like it was just a cramp in fact we we heard saw him say that but if youre John Shire in that moment your hearts probably got to stop for a beat oh yeah well the Freshman flag and canle right from the start have been terrific you see scoring 40 of the 85 points and that is just part of the story you know John Shire was telling me a story the other day I was asking about the relationship between canle and flag and he said Cooper wasnt practicing well one day and Khan screamed at him and said flag lock the F in wow what are you doing and then to Coopers he turned back and said I got you I got you y and thats something else that permeates through the team if he is accountable and allows for himself to be account held accountable by his peers its great Darren Harris The Freshman from hearnden Virginia has his first three points as a Duke Blue Devil Applause Applause carry tough shot off the window too strong Brown clears the rebound foul on the three will send Harris to the free throw line and we talked so much about the three freshman in the starting line lineup but John shy as usual with the number one rated incoming freshman class in the country this year its not just three guys in Harris is a big part of it he was rated number 31 of the ESPN 100 last year and that shows you how tough it can be to get uh playing time on a roster this deep maybe the most talented in the country well hes going to be good I mean hes already good but but to your point they just dont have enough room you know to get them out there certainly in in close Gam games you know he and and Isaiah Evans are kind of fighting the same battle but Harris can shoot hes talented and and will be good in time well North Carolina has its share of Highly touted freshman coming up next the number nine Tarheels will host Elon willll wrap up the night with a nothing but net crew then at 1100 Easter what a way to tip off the season right here on accn and the ESPN app here in the Triangle starting with the Blue Devils and then well toss it off two Chapel Hill and well see what the uh tar Hills have in store for the start of their season that has become a tradition on acc Network to have back to back 7 to 00 games either start at Duke and go to Carolina this year or other years going the other way around seon James somehow keeps his footing and lays it in 11 points the out of lanir high school in Georgia again he averaged 14 points per game a season too with two lane he is capable of putting up numbers Gillis steals it away and here comes James Evans flares to the corner Gillis fills in on the wing and buries the triple again Brown James and Gillis bring so much experience to this young Duke roster they sure do Mason Gillis won 110 games in four years at Purdue of course played in a national championship he was 110 and 29 in four years at Purdue they won 29 games two years ago 29 games the year after that and last year they won 34 games at Purdue and of course Zack Edy has a lot to do with that but Mason Gillis a big part of it hes physical hes tough hes got that big brother vibe to him and he can score he put 29 on Penn State a couple of years ago including a Macky record nine made threes he has played in 11 career NCAA tournament games of that veteran leadership in his fifth year coming to Durham is just going to pay dividends all year long for Coach shy he is now the sixth Duke player tonight to reach double figures Applause Browns pass knocked away stolen by Keon Burns and he makes him pay with the driving Applause layup well Burns has 15 points to lead M steel fouled out with 11 with just under a minute remaining here at Cameron well after two blowout exhibitions they beat division 2 Lincoln 10756 and then Arizona State 10347 in those two games Duke shot the lights out 45 they have not shot quite that well tonight but uh at 38 thats good what have you seen Out of the Blue Devils in their first regular season game tonight yeah I think they were better defensively in in this second half you know the the question for them when you start getting to play better teams is can they defend and rebound consistently you know and the offensive glass hurt them a little bit in the first half but their offense is really tough to guard I mean it starts again with the ability to three to to shoot the three and the number of guys they have that can do that and the gravity that that creates on the floor and and again John shers did a nice job leveraging that but can they defend in rebound consistently against good teams I think becomes the question Clayton cant get the roll and Duke with six double figure scores can just dribble it out canle 22 flag 187 rebounds five assists 11 points a piece for foster and James 10 AP piece for Gillis and Pro a lot of weapons this year for people to deal with when they face the Blue Devils your final score is6 9662 your final score the regular season here at Cameron is underway with a bag The Freshman lived up to the expect
