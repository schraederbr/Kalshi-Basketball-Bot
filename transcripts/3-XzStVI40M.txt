thing that would concern Steve the most is if Louisville were to get a lot more momentum built offensively here You got to stay within reach early right Thats why you got to make early shots You will get shots against Louisville but when you miss them if you dont get back in defense you see already they get far shots And here is Spinners rolling to the basket Fall away and gets crew too strong

Ill take it a step further Its a different flavor Like Khalifa shoots the three does the dribble handoff Few has shown us he can set the screen and roll to the rim or catch it in traffic and finish Coleman knocks down the front end of the one and one after the block on conv But to your point they complement each other One guy can shoot the three one guy lives in the and Miles gets both of them
