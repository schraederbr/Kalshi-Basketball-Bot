to start the season Clarence Armstrong Jerry Heater and Adam Flor the officials here today in Dallas And a really nice crowd on hand all things considered That was a concern for SMU folks How many would make it here Student section is full and just about everywhere else people are filling in quite nicely SMU coming off that 9179 win on the road against Wake Forest on Tuesday It was their third quad one victory of the season A post touch for Cemetu out to Poopy Miller who misses the three Thats a great inside out to start the ball game Getting the ball inside to the big fella paint touch Three is what you really want to try to get Second time the nullles have used this starting lineup The first time was Tuesday night in the win over Miami So why mess with a good thing Luke Locks has used 10 different starting lineups this season Might have found something with this group Johny Wiggins could not hit the triple Offensive rebounds based by Yigatlu Shot clock has reset for Florida State The song the freshman has really come on Left the layup short Alex Steam couldnt hit the follow and its cleared by BJ Edwards Well for SMU this lineup has been a main stay just about the entire season Cory Washington offline for three and gathers the rebound That win over Miami was Florida States first ACC win It was also their first win over a power conference team this year and their first true road win as McCrae misses Coming off a game too where they didnt shoot you know they known to shoot about 34 threes a game They only shot 17 in that ball game Edwards can hit the three 35 on the year The games first points belong to BJ Edwards Edward picking up where where he left off the last ball game coming out aggressive looking to score the basketball They hit three triples in that win over Wake McCrae on the attack Miller trying to bottle him up and Miller clears it for SMU They love to run when they can with Boopy Miller who draws the foul Again BJ being aggressive here to start the ball game just like he did was in the last ball game He had 24 points an outing against Wake Forest Great job stepping into a shot ready to shoot the basketball All defensive player a year ago in the ACC and could very well contend for just all conference honors period this year along with Boopy Miller who looks like a first team all ACC guard You know Ted he could be one of the most improved guys in the ACC this year with the numbers that hes putting up right now at this point here if he continues to be consistent throughout ACC play Millers second best free throw shooter in the ACC behind Cals Chris Bell 89 on the season Backtoback games of only 12 points He shot it only seven times the other night against Wake Hes an older guard I love the way he plays with the pace he plays with He usually tries to get everybody involved in the first half and then in the second half hes a lot more aggressive coming out to try to score the basketball Florida State has started 0 for six from the floor Martin Somerville in the game Excellent threepoint shooter The step back over Yigatollu at 72 and Edwards the rebound Yiglu has the mismatch inside He wants it against Somerville Wiggins lurking Nice pass by Igato Washington couldnt finish Oh and we got a wedgie A winter wedgie here in Dallas Its a really good burning cut by Washington and you know off the post inside Really good cut Great job of really offensive rebounding the basketball And already the second personal on Chanty Wiggins as Yigolu the native of Turkey prepares to shoot two Those are big fouls on Chanty Wiggins Wiggins has been playing really well Well hes given him a great scoring uh burst here over the last couple ball games Thats going to be a big foul situation for him And Wiggins has to exit just like that as Steen comes back in for Florida State Now with Yatollu you said it yesterday at practice Rodney such an important player for SMU and their longterm hopes this season He really is He gives him a big time inside presence No one really has a guy 72 that can score the basketball the way he does and offensive rebound You have to game plan for him every single game Almost 3 minutes in Nolles just trying to dent the scoreboard 0 for seven McCrae the nifty look Could not convert Miller races ahead and the deflection by Somerville Itll stick with SMU You know T when you get off the kind of start that Florida States got off to offensively music now you got to hang your hat on your defense You got to sit down You got to want to go out and put some stops together defensively This Florida State defense has great length athleticism They got to sit down and want to try to put some stops together Maybe get some offense off their defense Trying to build on what they did to slow down Miami the other night Geron Pierre Jr can fill it up He hits for SMU Pierre averaging 17 a game 10th in the ACC The second leading scoreer for SMU behind Miller Bong the freshman in trouble Lost it MILLER DIGS IT OUT FOR SMU Thats really good defense by really BJ Elkins blew that whole offensive possession up by just taking that dribble handoff away Pierre too strong on the three Batted around Controlled by Miller How about the opposite corner Edwards in and out McCrae on the attack Nice drop off to Steen for Florida States first points McCraes done a great job of getting it into the teeth of the defense They just hadnt been able to finish but that thats a great finish right there by Alex Steen there Great pass by McCrae Now you see a little bit of zone defense here right now to give them a different look Kind of take them out of their rhythm a little bit offensively Think SMU will try to work the middle of that zone Edwards inside the arc rattles it home Great p great patience by Edwards there Just really good under control Great look there by McCrae again Alex Dean inside Really good look One of the best passers in the ACC McCrae now McCrae ranking third in the league Six and a half assists per game Just a shade behind Miller who leads the conference just under seven into the middle of that zone with finds the cutting Edwards and he flips it in Great job attacking the zone there by SMU to put the big fell in the middle of there Hes just again patiently waiting for the cutters there from the baseline Really great job attacking that two3 zone Edwards with seven already for SMU McCrae left it short Batted out to Leger Jones who misses the triple Miller had it knocked out of his hands by Somerville The love to Vong and the freshman can get up Bans a goodlooking freshman Got out did a great job of getting out running the floor Great delivery there in transition Song making his fourth consecutive start as he developed out of Paris France His first year here with FSU underneath Two injection by Stain He got a piece of it from Washington We got some tired guys out there right now No blow right now They got to continue to try to sit down and finish out this this segment here Somerville churning Yes Almost 6 minutes without a timeout And music now we have it with the foul on Cory Washington Helders here right now You take it easy on us right now Were you know we gave you an opportunity We need you to try to do the same for us right now in terms of getting this done today Locks Florida State team fell behind 8 nothing before scoring Martin Somerville at the line out of the timeout 86 on the season Yeah LZ had the great story this week Said that Enfield led that recruiting effort He came to the high school and he dragged LZ to the tennis courts and play tennis with him every day and Lukes like Are you recruiting me or are we just playing tennis Well you do whatever it takes to get a guy signed that can play for you And again coach had a great career at Florida State playing for coach H Played in four NCA tournaments Um had a great run at ACC tournament championship as well Late shot clock Cam Miles had to hoist another offensive rebound for Florida State This time its Jones and he scores with his left hand the dominant hand Its a nice job by the Seolles to punch back after that early start by SMU within three Florida States going to show theyre going to change defenses there Back in that zone again Jaden Tombs the highly touted freshman on the floor for SMU Couldnt bank it in Its a great look Great job getting into the interior of the defense there Got to be able to finish that one Thats a really good look Somerville the transfer from UMass LOL had the mismatch against Tombs and he took him off the bounce to the cup Somerville has given him some really good minutes over the last couple ball games Hes a guy that can really score the basketball Coming in give a really good lift off the bench Its a 92 run by Florida State to close within a point Miller tracked down by Edwards Fresh 20 for SMU Miller passes up the three this time and he hits over Jones Well hes aggressive early I mean looking for his shot Hes a guy can score the basketball He likes to get a lot of guys involved but its a great sign when hes coming out trying to score the basketball early Top five in the ACC in both scoring and assist Jones attacking and he draws the foul as Tombs meets him near the rim again Its a great shot fake by Jones getting downhill getting an opportunity to get to the foul line Now they didnt call it on Tombs they called it on Geron Pierre Jr his first But Jones at the line nonetheless 74 on the year The transfer from St Bonaventure You know he didnt shoot it well Tuesday night in the win over Miami Just one for six had three points but hes helping the team in other ways And Luke Lou has really tried to impart that to him Defense rebounding all the little things to help the team out You got to have guys that want to do the dirty work and do do things again that doesnt show up in the stat sheet and hes been one of those guys thats done that done that for the Florida State team over the last couple balls and the seminals back to within a point as Bong returns and Jones gets a breather When youre scoring 10 youre able to set your defense change your defense and theyre able to do that Now theyre going to have to really place a little bit more emphasis on Miller Millers gotten off to a great start today offensively Four points a couple of assists Edwards has seven Make it 10 Another triple for Edwards This older back court man they do a great job of sharing the ball and scoring the ball and being aggressive A mile sliding SMU fans wanted a whistle there No turnover Bong stepping into a three and that is way off the mark cheering but Florida State retains possession under five to shoot Miles launches loose ball again Florida State claiming it at the bottom of the pile Pierre grabbing it and a foul on Florida State Time out Florida State digging out of an early hole Fourpoint game here in Dallas Such a key cog this year with SMU back in the NCA tournament mix out of the timeout Three ball doesnt go down for Germaine ONeal Jr the son of the 18year NBA veteran Really good job of SMU attacking that trap Florida State came out with the a half court trap and they got a great look The ball just didnt go down Florida State five of their last 10 after starting 0 for eight Kobe McGee off the mark and Yigu corrals it SMU led this game 8 nothing before Florida State got going Miller against the bigger Maluke Edwards over the top Tombs on the offensive glass couldnt put it back in that size though I love to have Tombs at the four you know playing there getting a chance to get that backside rebound Hes just got to be able to gather himself and finish that basket Loose ball underneath Maloo at the bottom of that We got a tie up and itll stay at this end with the arrow Jaden Tombs was awfully happy to see you yesterday in practice Im sure that you were involved in his recruiting when he was in high school Yeah we spent a lot of time recruiting Tombs Tombs a really good player out Amarillo Good young talent Coach Infield and his staff have done a great job recruiting Texas Oh got it And a foul from the corner Martin Somerville and a chance for one more A big play opportunity Baseline out of bounds defense No just kind of caught the guys sleeping a little bit Somerville gets a great look and knocks down a big three in the corner You know Ted that baseline out of bounds defense those are special team situations You dont want to give up an opportunity to score Thats just an opportunity for a full court for play here for some of you And hes got it to tie the score at 17 And Somerville has given Florida State a spark off the bench yet again Now theyre able to set their defense to get a little bit fullourt pressure See if they slide back into their to their zone and stay in that zone action a little bit or do they match up Look like theyre going to match up a little bit right now 10 to shoot for SMU Miller against Somerville to ONeal The other corner short and coming right near us now to Florida State You know and thats what Luke L told us yesterday He he wants to be able to pressure Boopy Miller when they can especially after Mess Just disrupt the offensive rhythm Well again you know Ted hes a guy that initiates the offense for them If you can have someone else have to initiate the offense and you can take him away from being the prime facilitator that really disrupts what they want to do offensively Florida State has not led today And Somerville puts Florida State on top with a triple Hes got 10 And on word in the huddle after Luke Loud who said Guys we just got our first win in the ACC It is time to break the door down You know again a team coming in here with some momentum after you know gaining their first conference win you know on the road So again their team has been battle tested and uh theyre coming out aggressive They got off to a slow start but they they continued to work the ball game SMU hasnt scored in the last 2 and 12 minutes over the last four Pierre an air ball No thats the new selling right now Theyre not really get any kind of paint touches right now Somerville halfway down that time Somehow it didnt drop For States in that zone Miller off the screen ONeal rising up Yattou picks it up and puts it back in Wait through Yigu in the side a little bit Get that ball inside out like they attacked earlier with their zone offense where they had a guy cut from the baseline Lets get a little movement Get a shot on their turn Song over the top Songs had two really tough looks from three He might want to try to get that ball inside a little bit Hes hit nine threes on the year in limited attempts Pierre from the corner Washington an offensive rebound got McCrae off his feet He draws the foul Nice up fake by Washington against McCrae Wash is one of those glue kind of guys Great job attacking the glass Great job of getting him up in the air and getting an opportunity to get to the foul line Cory Washington And Washington the transfer from Wah State 82 at the line this year Itll be another big day here on ACC music Network next Saturday Pit and Clemson at noon Eastern followed by North Carolina matching up with Georgia Tech Both games also on the app How about the Heels pulling off their biggest win of the year earlier today coming back from down 16 to beat Virginia in Charlottesville Thats a big win early here in conference play Virginias been playing great to start conference play here at 51 That was a huge win on the road Had some big guys step up Stevenson stepped up big for him down the stretch for North Carolina to get that win on the road today SMU back in front with the free throws by Washington McCrae barreling ahead and he floats it home That has been an emphasis for him here recently McCra is a guy that can distribute the basketball but he can also score Hes done a great job of really getting into the peak of the defense today and attacking the paint Luke Lou has told him in the last week you have to look to score first Teams are playing the passing lanes a little more and ITS LEADING TO TURNOVERS Washington downhill with a bucket High percentage shot man Get downhill Get in that paint When shots are not falling from the outside attack the paint the teeth of the defense Washington had 23 in SMUs win over North Carolina earlier this month McCrae spun out Once again Yigolu has the mismatch inside the cheering lob and Yugato could not finish Thats a foul Extra feed McCrae off the mark and Pierre comes down with the rebound Fouled by there Hopefully sometime tomorrow they can back make it back to Tallahassee But when you go out on the road like that Ted and youre coming off a great road win you dont mind being on the road The guys togetherness there theyre getting a good chemistry Theyre theyre excited about being together Had a lively practice yesterday on this floor Three ball off the mark from BJ Davis Ray another SMU freshman whos carving out a role part of the best recruiting class that SMU has had Miles missed and a foul with Jones going after the rebound Thats Jones on the glass again doing the dirty work eating the glass Thats nine offensive rebounds right now for Florida State That seems going to do a better job physical with the blockouts keeping these guys off off the glass for second chance opportunity And RT that was such an emphasis yesterday Its who Florida State is Theyre second in the conference in offensive rebounds behind only one team Wake Forest And they only had four the other night against Miami Coach was saying that is unacceptable Steen gets fouled Alex Steen again has been a great addition to this team played division 2 basketball had a great career at at uh at Florida Southern there as at the uh as a division 2 player and I mean hes uh carried over at to now at division one Its been a great addition Now Thursday February 5th here on ACC Network such a special day year after year our womens basketball play for K double header At 16 Eastern its Clemson in North Carolina followed by Florida State and NC State there in Raleigh Of course the great Kay Yao winning 680 of her 737 career games at NC State the Hall of Famer A day to honor her legacy for sure right here on ACC Network So Florida State back up a point stay in that zone And that zone has really bothered SMU again and uh theyve settled for for shots and really not getting into the teeth of the defense Washington had to come out with two personals now He and Jaden Tombs both with two for the Mustangs Pierre connects Its called a two on the floor They will take a look at the next timeout with McCrae off the floor Somerville and Miles operating and an offensive foul called against Alex sticking the leg out All right so is this a two or a three The other trip down the floor music Check toes Thats really close I really like the possession though Florida State came down offensively trying to get Somerville a look Hes the guy that has had the hot hand during the first half Somerville with 10 Edwards with 10 to lead their teams Miller always a leader Boom He drills a three No question about that one Great movement Great job attacking the paint Getting an open look for Miller for three Miller 39 from downtown and well behind the line here Really good job Pierre attacking reverse pivot out Really good pass to to Booby Miller Wiggins back in the game right now with two fouls We have to watch that that situation there for him And firing right away hitting right on QRT Comes in and takes a shot right off the bat I mean hes given them some scoring over the last couple ball games So they miss his scoring when hes not in the ball game Hes going to have to play really smart in there right now defensively and not pick up that third foul And here he is against Yigatu Wiggins giving up about 4 in in that match up ABOUT 50 LBS NO PIERRE from downtown If SMU starts hitting threes watch out Talking about the second best scoring offense in the league behind Louisville Wiggins picked up the dribble Jones catching fire and Pierre on the move for SMU Miller in rhythm Long rebound to Pierre Walters wants it OPEN LOOK AND ANOTHER LONG REBOUND claimed this time by Boopy Miller Couldnt hit inside the arc Got some really great looks right there from SMU sharing the basketball And AJ Swinton streaming to the bucket He draws the foul Five games in ACC play for the first time in 25 years But what a breakthrough it was on the road Tuesday night against rival Miami trying to build on that here today Also on the road Bong on the move cut off by the fellow freshman Tombs McCrae back on the floor for Florida State Deflected and stolen by Pierre On the break Hiller gave it up and got it back Edwards gets another triple his third of the first half Great ball movement right there Edwards ready to step in and shoot that basketball Great job attacking the basket by McCrae getting downhill Great answer Now Robert McCrae the fifth with his second bucket Hes got four Just two of eight shooting in this first half for Florida States top scorer Miller sprays it and Jeron Vier cans another triple Hes got three of them Corner threes been really kind to SMU today Florida States got to do a better job of getting out there contesting those shots from the corner Largest lead of the game for SMU Jones misses inside and finally bowled out to Boie Miller Got fouled by Bassong who tried to hop him for a piggyback ride You know Boop is an older guard Hes a guy with a lot of experience He gets a lot of fouls this way Those threes from the corner again You see BJ Edwards from the corner Pierre from the corner as well Florida States got to do a better job of getting out there closing to those shooters making those guys put the ball on the deck I mean this is why SMU is a contender again And in that NCA tournament conversation theres so much firepower Well Ted anytime you have the older experience that you have in that back court with Miller and Edwards those guys are they played a lot of basketball and theyre very experienced I music mean you can go as far as your guard play when it when you start talking about post postseason aspirations and postseason play I mean its continuity that you just dont see Andy Enfield welcomes back Miller and Edwards They add Giron Pierre who was the fourth leading scoreer in the nation at Jacksonville State a year ago And despite this rugged schedule to start ACC play yes theyre three and three Theyve lost to the top three teams in the standings entering the weekend And music both of those guys in the back court great stories You know you talk about Ruby Miller whos been in the ACC at Wake Forest You talk about uh BJ Edwards who started out at Tennessee You know again great stories Hes improved every year playing college basketball So a double digit lead for SMU Wiggins the turnaround and Tombs grabs it for SMU underneath two scores Great job of not selling by SMU Getting that ball inside They got a size advantage there Great finish inside Best recruit in SMU history Tombs with his first bucket In and out for Swinton and out of bounds Still Florida State ball I dont think Ted weve talked enough about about this young freshman class that uh Coach Infield has assembled He and his staff has done a great job recruiting Texas They brought in some really good young players Um you know that theyre going to be able to build around for a number of years Yeah four of them were in the ESPN 100 off the inbound Steen muscles it in with a foul Coach Infield is not going to be happy with that baseline out of bounds defense Thats twice now that theyve given up offensive opportunity and a chance to go to the foul line from the baseline Your baseline out of out of bounds defense you got to get set You got to be ready and you got to have some awareness as youre getting ready to try to defend baseline out of bounds sets Yeah Tombs that decorated freshman that were talking about just picked up his third personal Thats a tough situation for him right there Again maybe not a blown assignment by him but he comes over and and commits a uh commits a foul and hes got to sit the rest of the half here Stain at the line and cuts the lead to 10 Stains got nine Somerville still leads the NLES with 10 off the bench Top fullcourt pressure right now You see uh Florida State fall back in that two3 zone again Thats been very effective for him here in the first half Edwards has hit three threes over that zone Got McCrae off his feet WALTER STEPS INTO IT HE DROPS IT IN Thats his roll off the bench for sure Walkers a guy that can stretch the floor from the perimeter Its a great find by Edwards McCrae wants to answer near the final minute of the half and Miller draws the foul on McCrae Just a smart veteran move by Booby Miller that you know to initiate some contact He knows theyre in the foul situation where hes going to be able to get to the foul line and and shoot some free throws Who better than you want at the foul line than than Millerbody Now McCrae with his second and again one and one for Boopy The only thing that has really stopped Boopy Miller this year is the flu Didnt play against Duke two weeks ago He was at the hotel room Of course he misses the front end of the one and one Thats just thats what happens Rodney Its how it works No such thing as the announcers Jinx Cant blame you Under a minute to go Florida States got to earn a basket right here Theyve got to have some momentum going into the half here Great job getting into the paint by McCree Hes got to finish that twofoot play He goes in off one foot Those are tough finishes A little awkward with the off hand too His right hand He is a lefty Miller Oh Yukatu crashing the offensive glass and hes fouled Great job of Yukatollo getting on that glass Hes got the size advantage in there Great job of crashing it in that glass And Bong collects his second foul Iu one for two today just 56 on the season the tallest player in the ACC Rodney at 72 Not to mention he goes 270 lbs You can totally Theres not a lot of guys like him in college basketball I mean hes a major problem inside You have to game plan for him in terms of trying to take away his his inside presence on offense And he gives you some rim protection on defense as well Got a piece of it So did BJ Davis Ray and Pierre saves it for SMU Under 30 seconds to play in the half Edwards launching and Jones reaching up for the board and hes fouled So one and one coming up for Le Jones You had some time on that music time and situation on that on that particular shot there Then you put the freshman in a tough spot The foul there You dont really want to foul and put those guys at the foul line there in that in that type music of situation You want to try to again you you have a great lead right now You have momentum You dont want to give these guys any hope going into halftime So one and one here for Jones the senior from Neptune Beach transferred from St Bonaventure his fourth school in four years and Jones will have one more Well tonight at 10 Eastern after the games wrap up right here on ACC Network nothing but net Well catch you all up today All the highlights and analysis A big day here in the ACC And the look ahead to all the matchups coming up next week Not sure what happened to the big fell Hes living limping off right now Didnt get a chance to see what happened to him I dont know if he got need there a little bit but hes in hes in a little bit of pain going to the bench right now and trying to box out AJ Swinton there It looked like been a little bone on bone a little bit there Going to get in at halft time get a little massage on that on that lower leg So Mitchell Holmes the red shirt freshman from Fort Worth checks in for the first time Boy I was in some agony on the bench as trainers hover near him SMU can hold for the final shot Miller guarded by the freshman Bass takes him off the bounce met by Ste Back inside Holmes and Holmes on the floor for the first time Could not hit at the buzzer but the lead is a dozen zone that Florida State switched to about midway through Ted they averaged about 18 assists They had 11 in that half there doing a great job of sharing the basketball And good news for SMU that cement Yatola was on the floor to start Remember he banged knees with AJ Swinton late in the first half He was in a lot of pain and a foul called against Florida State and Le Jones right away Yiglu now has a compression sleeve on that left leg Yeah Ted he took a bone to bone contact in the half there but looked like hes going to be okay Came out in warmups was moving pretty good SMU did a great job coming out here but their execution against his zone to start They got into the teeth of the defense and Washington was able to get to the foul line So they hope that Yukatus mobility isnt all that affected Keep an eye on that Washington now at five for SMU Florida State shot just 30 in the first half Its an ACC low for them in any half so far this season McCra trying to drop it off to Wiggins Knocked out of bounds and still seminal ball Thats a really tough pass in tight quarters there You get that far and that deep in there you got to put that ball up on the glass and let your guys go rebound the basketball But Ted to your point they were 3418 there to start the half thought they did a nice job of really getting in the paint early and uh and had a lot of good second chance opportunities as well with 11 offensive rebounds in that first half And Florida State climbed out of an eight nothing hole to start this game Five to shoot Wiggins puts it up and Steen with an offensive rebound OH ROBERT MCCRAE THE fifth springs for legs Thatll take the lid off right there Right And thats a former state high school high jump champion in South Carolina McCrae can get up 10 in high school He jumped 16 to win a state championship I mean thats fine for a young guy his size Oh Miller the scoop doesnt drop McCrae on the move and Bong with the finish Thats more Bons game out in the open court finishing at the rim I thought coach did a great job of coaching with him in the first half there as he took a couple of shots from the outside Work your game Play within yourself a little bit You see him coming back here to start the half Get to the paint Fighting with Bong for position McCrae comes from the weak side Its the first turnover of the game for SMU How about that McCrae trying to capitalize and he does What a stretch from Robert McCrae the fifth here to start the second half right now I mean hes coming off a game where in their last conference game where they won he had 20 points He had he was two for 10 in that first half They need him to get going a little bit Hes got eight points right now Had a great momentum play on offense with a really good defensive play on the other end from the weak side It was a dunk an assist a steal and another bucket for McCrae as Florida State is within seven Theyre sticking with this zone defense right here Great job attacking right now with Washington into the teeth of the defense Great finish Washington such an energy player an X factor for SMU Now the block by Yigatu but still Florida State ball and McCrae wanted to play Rodney for Florida State because of Luke LS a former point guard himself As we take another look at the block Absolutely Vang taking the coach and getting downhill trying to play his game right now to his strength Stain inside tough position against Yigolu Jones corrals the pass somehow I think the thing said too for McCrae he wanted to play with guys that have coached at the NBA level the next level cuz again its an aspiration he has to be a next level player and the coaching staff at Florida State really presented that opportunity for him Florida State ball with the arrow La says that what hes tried to impart to McCrae is hey you have to be more vocal McCrae naturally quiet and even if you make a mistake its on to the next play You are the point guard You are our leader You have to move on Next play mentality You got to be a guy that overcommunicates out there when youre the point guard and the main guy Shot clock dying here Back into the hands of McCrae against Edwards an ace defender McCrae rising OH HE BANKED IT IN YOU DONT have to call it on the weekend The bank is open right now McCrae big basket right there to bring those guys closer in And again he getting himself going a little bit too Hes got 11 points now They need him to get going Now Pierre pulled the string Here comes McCrae Edwards fights through the screen A nifty pass Ste with the tip in Really good job by McCrae attacking that drop coverage getting downhill creating for a teammate Alex staying with the with the play BJ Edwards couldnt hit his fourth three and its cleared by Wiggins McCrae on the move again Jones thought about it against Pierre takes him inside AND SH SWIRLS IT IN The run continues for Florida State Theyre within a bucket SMUs largest lead 14 coming late in the first half Edwards run off the threepoint line Couldnt float it Iu keeps it alive and knocked out of his hands by Florida State Sate and any fan watching only one turnover by McCrae which has been his problem Florida State forces a turnover out of the timeout Theyre on a 132 run And now can Tyer take the lead You know Ted right now the way SMUs come out theyve got to try to put some consecutive stops together defensively Maybe Im going have to look at changing their defense a little bit because right now Florida States very comfortable with what theyre doing SMU does not have a stop yet here in the second half Florida State has scored on their first six possessions They were down a dozen at the break to Andy Enfields team 11 to shoot You cant let your offense affect your defense on the other end of the floor Wiggins down low against Tombs And theres the first stop for SMU here in the second half Miller got bumped and boy thats against Wiggins Thats his third You dont really want to pick up that kind of foul in transition getting back defensively if youre Wiggins music You want to sprint back do your work early Youre guarding the biggest guy out there cuz youre the biggest guy out there for Florida State but you dont want to pick up that kind of foul in that situation So three on Wiggins stays in there and knocked out of bounds and still SMU ball Martin Somerville arguing his case Havent had a challenge yet Maybe we will from Florida State Of course thats the And you know who are the most valuable guys right now Those guys behind the bench with those tablets that are paint they got to be paying attention at all times So your video guys your administrative guys back there theyve got to be on point That technology introduced just recently as well Jones for the lead Hes caught it Florida State on top The Florida State teams come out of they come out of halftime now with a lot of momentum a lot of energy Once again Florida State punching back after getting bloodied down 8 nothing to start the game They took the lead down 14 late in the first half and theyre back in front Pierre and a foul called on the floor Boy McCrae came down with the rebound but a foul called on Somerville You see again Jones in the corner shot ready Great finish The bench all excited You got a lot of energy over there right now on that Simol side right now Jaylen Crawford going insane And why not Think Florida States going stir crazy staying all this time in Dallas because of the winter weather Now theyve got the lead on the road coming off their first ACC win of the season They want number two Miller lost the handle Scooped up by Tombs Seven to shoot Tombs against the veteran Wiggins The kick Freshman to freshman AND GERMAINE ONEAL JR CONNECTS TED those guys have done that a few times Those guys are like brothers You know they played together Dynamic Prep coached by Germaine ONeal Senior Those guys have done that a few times They know exactly what theyre looking for Wiggins trying to respond No Swinton had it for a moment Its collected by Edwards Now Tombs has lived with the ONeal since he was in the eighth grade MORE LIKE BROTHERS NOW TOMB SCORES for SMU Great answer out of out of SMU right now from all this momentum with Florida State coming out in the second half Somerville against the bigger Yigolu Sweating off the jump stop and staying at this end Yigu cant believe it as Tombs hit the deck How about SMU firing back after Florida State took the lead Selling in here You see Tombs finding ONeal Jr out there ready spotting up for a three Great find by again the big fella Postto post passing interior passing there They got the size Great job of working that interior Jones wants another three and Edward skies for it Look out Cam Miles tried to pick it off and still SMU ball Thing you love about Edwards hes one of those guards that does whatever it takes to win I mean hes rebounding down there in a big situation there to try to close out a possession He does a little bit of everything Six boards three assists and 13 points for Edwards after he had a careerhigh tying 24 points in the win over Wake earlier this week In the hands of Edwards against the taller steam down low scores it is Edwards again finding the mismatch inside Great interior pass there It was matched up against McGee and Yigolu capitaliz SMU has stretched this lead back TO SIX MILLER STRIKING AT IT Miller right at the bottom It is a tie up and SMU has it with the arrow Edwards with a great interior pass right here doing a little bit of everything Its amazing what happens when you start scoring a little bit You get a little bit more energy on your defense on the other end You see guys getting on the floor Boopy Miller getting in there getting a jump ball situation and theyve got possession and RT thats going to determine SMU ceiling right And how they perform defensively over these last two months because theyre a great offensive team They can score the basketball One of the best scoring teams in the country Miller lines it up cheering Miles connects Thats a three at the half Miles first points of the game Great hit ahead pass right there by McCree though Just great vision up the floor to find the opening guy up the floor Turns the lob once again High school teammates now college teammates trying to connect They couldnt do it Miles underneath the basket and knocked out of bounds by the latter stages of the first half And SMU up by three now McCra has been huge here in the second half for Florida State Jones no tip UP TRY BY MILES STE FINISHES IT OFF Second chance opportunities Thats 16 offensive rebounds right now for Florida State Theyve done a great job crashing the glass and giving themselves other opportunities to score the basketball Great job there Florida States plus four on the glass overall Millers had a tough shooting day It continues to tried to save it Its out of bounds to the NLP Miller two for 11 Hes got nine points Hasnt scored here in the second half You know Ted hes one of those gamerls though You know you get you want him to continue to stay aggressive Hes a guy again that can take over a game in the blink of an eye So you want him to continue to be more aggressive especially looking to score the basketball Edwards who had 13 in the first half he hasnt scored either here in the second He gets a breather And Geron Pierre is back in Oh by the way he hasnt scored since halftime as well I like the change right now Start change the defense a little bit Look like theyre plant trying to play a little bit more of a zone right now Giving them a different look They worked on this two3 zone a little bit in practice yesterday So the change up being thrown by Andy Anfield McCrae with five against the longer Pierre and McCrae hits it in his face Pretty good defense just better offense right there McCraes coming out to score right now Hes aggressive here in the second half And the Seinals are back on top Washington the spin against Jones Couple of spins and hes fouled Boy at times SMUs best play today has been Cory Washington attacking Washingtons done a great job getting into the paint Twofoot plays trying to score the basketball Older veteran player Calm things down when you can get to the teeth of the defense and get a high percentage shot Transfer from Witchah State has been a nice compliment to all that firepower in the back court for Andy Enfield He had 23 against Carolina in the ACC music opener but he scored in single digits four of the last five And when the flu ripped through this team a couple of weeks ago that was certainly a factor Washington up to eight points today Tell you got two of the better free throw shooting teams in the league So if youre able to get to that foul line youre able to catch those music And Washington has SMU back in front Stay in that zone Look again And so its kind of been a tandem look It turns into a two3 Just a different look for again Florida State They kind of got comfortable coming out here in the second half Nice pass again by McCrae and Alex Steen is fouled Foul goes against Pierre his second And Steen whos got 13 points and eight boards today has two at the line Now the latest in the Were number one documentary series It chronicles the 1993 National Championship North Carolina team led by Dean Smith Joel Barry in the studio is all over this Look at never before seen footage interviews with players and coaches available now streaming on the ESPN app That was a great team and

ball is so low Hes 72 Bring that ball up to your chin big fella Chin that ball Look that look down in that basket a little bit Miller accelerates and he flips it home SMU needs BY Miller to catch fire here down the stretch We saw Coach Infield over there having a really good talk with Booby Miller over there just a second ago and saying Hey probably saying some things along the line Its your time right now McCrae lost the handle but the whistle blows Its a foul cheering And its the first on Miller Yep Ski goggles the giveaway today for the students Theyre still wearing them How perfect with

THE POSTER WAKE UP big fella We come bringing it right to you right now McCras coming and playing a big RA right now Hes playing playing big boy ball right now Put the big fella in the rim Robert McCrae the fifth landing on the highlight reel again Pierre on the try and hes fouled Ted hes using all six 610 jumping ability on this right here Just a fanatic big time finish by McCrae knowing hes going to get challenged at the rim Finishes at a very high level Hes got that 610 again We talked about that high jump state championship in high school Hes an explosive guard at AC Florida High School in Columbia South Carolina Robert McCrae has brought his best here in the second half He definitely has Hes come out and really set the tone for his team Really willing these guys back in this ball game Pierre does his job at the line Guess that hes staying in his zone right now Kind of slowed him down a little bit and trying to try to take them out of a rhythm offensively Deflected by Washington Still got there to Jones Someville and controlled by Washington Miller the allAmerican candidate against Somerville And Somerville with the strip What a play by Martin Somerville Look out MCCRAE GOT PAST WASHINGTON FOR TWO MORE McCrae is doing it all Hes doing it all He said Feed on my back guys Come on Ride with me right now Lets go 17 for McCrae Tied again Under eight to go Washington lost the handle Has to retreat against Jones Under 10 to shoot Got it to Pierre Down to three A fall away OH PIERRE IS STILL PURE cheering Pierres really good in that midrange though Thats kind of one of his patented shots right there You see him make that shot over the course of the season And look what I found for Chanty Wiggins after the pole Pinball to him Now Pierre against the taller Wiggins 10 on the timer Pierre for three Bullse A quick five from Geron Pierre Jr Somerville to the tie HE RATTLES IT HOME HOW ABOUT THE SHOT making right now The one more the extra pass right

the other side of the floor for ONeal Now Yiku against Wiggins Bottled up and a foul And you got to go back down on the other end of four and you got to put some stops together music It is SMU ball out of the timeout music Miller the all ACC and all American contender throwing it in and McCrae with the interception McCrae flips it in A MASSIVE SECOND HALF FOR MCCRAE Hes got 19 15 since the play There goes that man again He I mean he has come out to play in the second half He has put this team on his back and he has drilled these guys in the second half to a lead right now Nigatola looking for an outlet instead Backing down Wiggins He finds Pierre who puts it home Tied again Really good interior passing right there Letting the game come to him Finally Pierre underneath the basket Now theyve got to come down and they got to sit down and guard a little bit here in this zone They got to steal some possessions with this change up defense Pass out to Swinton A three ball Wiggins fighting for the offensive rebound It is out to SMU You know I dont know if I really like that shot Anytime you got a back into a three thats really not music a good shot You dont have good balance there Maybe not maybe not the best three you want to take in that situation for SMU Pierre has been scorching He has the last nine for the Mustangs Heres Edwards and heading the other way Its an offensive foul Somerville hit the floor Yiglu with his second Yigatlos got that size inside already He really doesnt have to extend his arms out you know just seal him off hold your ground stand your ground carve your territory out and you really dont have to have that foul in the paint there So Yigolu takes a seat Its the seventh turnover by SMU and all coming here music in the second half McCrae trying to put Florida State BACK IN FRONT LOST IT GOING UP THANKS TO BOOPY MILLER And a foul against Florida State You know Ted Florida States tried to do a good job of really trying to screen the top part of the zone giving McCrae an opportunity to try to get into the teeth of the defense but Booby Booby was much better right there defensively in terms of trying to take that away and not letting him get into the teeth of the defense Really good music defense by Miller I mean RT you talk about low man winning Boopy Miller is always the low man Youre not going to get any lower to the ground than Boopy I mean one of the one of the best guards music in the country You want him at the foul line here You want your guards to try to close out games for you as well at the foul line One and one for Miller and he misses the front end 89 on the season and the rear misfire McCrae guarded by Miller Wiggins in the middle of that zone The turn around and secured by Edwards Poked out by Somerville Tombs claims it Pierre Oh in and out and controlled by Florida State Got a great look you know with a guy again thats been shooting the basketball well today in Pierre McCrae has 19 to lead Florida State We near the fourminute mark Jones defended by Washington Five to shoot cheering The step back three It is a switch Wow Second three for Jones Florida State by three Pierre banks it home for SMU Its a great answer Now SMUs got to come back down here and do a good job Theyre still in their zone defense Florida States giving them a heavy dose of screening the top part of this zone to try to get it into the teeth of the defense And a timeout for 0 and five Ted Emerick Rodney Terry with you and the Nolles have the ball out of this timeout Absolutely I mean theyve got to try theyve got a 20 seconds on the shot clock Theyve done a great job trying to string the top part of the zone SMU is going to stay in that zone Lets see if theyve got some kind of zone play set up right now McCrae has been brilliant in the second half They screen the middle of the zone try to get the ball inside if they could It was a set play didnt work Now they got to get something done out of Miller late in the shot clock McCoy the turnaround left short Good defensive possession right there by SMU out of the timeout Edwards has not scored in the second half AND RIGHT ON screaming Q BJ Edwards flips it in with a foul He can help SMU to the advantage from the line at winning time these older guards right now Edwards Miller Pierre these guys have to step up at in music in a big way right now Winning time You play through your guards down the stretch Edwards had 13 in the first half He puts SMU in front and now a chance at a twopoint lead I like the action the last time down for Florida State though They really tried to screen in the middle guy Look for him inside We can try to see what theyre going to play out of this time now Theyre still trying to get that high ball screen against the two3 zone Five to shoot Wiggins to a cutting bong a kick ball that results in the shot clock resetting to 20 Really good defensive possession right there You dont want to kick that ball because it changes that clock You had about 4 seconds Now you go back to 20 now McCra throwing out to Williams Taken away by it Really good baseline out of bounds defense last year McCrae Edwards pulls it down for the Mustangs A fourpoint lead as we approach two minutes ago You want to get a really good possession right here A high percentage shot here by the guys you want shooting the basketball down the stretch here Pierre against Jones Five to shoot Pierre short Moody would come unglued if he had hit that Can McCrae bring Florida State back again The song cut off Under 10 on the timer Jones Oh making it sweet here in Dallas His third three Nulls within a point Great one more pass there as they move the basketball to share the basketball by Florida State And a timeout for SN Well see if Florida State stays in this two3 zone or they change up and go manto man here Edwards sends it in to Boopy Miller 11 points on three of 12 shooting Florida State has made Miller work today Look like theyre going to match up here manto man right now Wiggins playing with four Trying to stay in front of Pierre Under 10 to shoot PIERRE REVERSES IT HOME HE DIDNT settle that time Last time he settled when he had the mismatch Got to the basket High puts it in the shot cheering BONE TO THE RIM WIGGINS PUTS IT back home The whistle blows as well Yigu is losing it Pierre really again Great pace here Didnt settle got to the basket Good two foot play Good great finish down on the other end Great interior passing Really good cut by Bang getting a chance to go to the foul line Yeah So the follow try by Wiggins does not count The foul on Yigolu before cheering that and Gong at the line A poor free throw shooter this cheering year and he misses the first Big free throw blockout situation here right now When you have a guy on the line that you know is not a great free throw shooter you got to make sure you get really good blockouts right now by SMU Its his first trip to the line in this game The song 59 on the season Missed them SMU the rebound and a foul Its the fourth on Jones number 10 to score personal So Bong the freshman from Paris had a chance to make it a onepoint game Instead SMU can extend this threepoint lead at the other end And again you got your older guard at the free throw line You you close out games with your guards and you win games with experienced guards And you got Edwards at the line right now Hes had a really good ball game to this point He has had a really good scoring stretch over the last couple ball games Always stuffing the stat sheet Edwards has one more You know if youre Florida State right now Ted you dont have to come down and take a real quick three You can take a two set your defense try to turn them over stretch this game out a little bit You know you you got plenty of time here You dont want to come down and just jack up a real quick quick three Thats not a great shot So Edward splits the pair Its a fourpoint lead under 40 seconds And a timeout for the Seinals with 38 to go music 38 seconds SMU is going really small right now They got a small lineup out there right now They can switch everything right music now with that small lineup out there though Biggest thing is theyre going to have to rebound the basketball though with this small lineup Yeah No Tombs no Yiglu on the floor for SMU And to Jones and a foul by Edwards Its the fifth team foul again No free music throws here Florida State to inbound Theyre in a position where they can switch everything You want to keep everything in front of you You really dont want to foul And then you have to finish the possession with the blockout right now If youre Florida State you got to want to put pressure on the basket to try to get you something at the rim or try to get to the foul line Florida State has crushed SMU on the offensive glass today And now McCrae is fouled before he flipped it in Thats on Washington his third I like what McCrae was doing right there Next foul now they get to the line So you dont have to again settle for a quick bad three You still can put pressure on the basket right now to create something for yourself or get an opportunity to get to that foul line McCra into Somerville hit three threes McCrae against Miller and McCrae forces it in Twopoint game 21 seconds Miller navigates the traffic screaming Pier Jr brings the post down cheering McCra turning Jones Can he hit it Yes he can This games still not over Really good play by McCrae getting into the teeth of the defense Found Jones for a great look inside out Youre going to have to foul real quick There it is with 83 and BJ Edwards whos two of three at the line will step up with his team up one Now its decision making time for coach Infield as well You got one of your better free throw shooters at the line If he makes both of those youre going to be up three now Do you want to foul or you going to try to play this out You know if youre at home you probably want to try to try to foul You got a great free throw shooting team so fouling is probably something you want to do I know coachfield is over there talking with talking with the guys right now on what they want to do defensively But when you have a really good free throw shooting team Ted you feel comfortable fouling not in the act of shooting but fouling and putting those guys on the line and you get a chance to close the game out of the free throw line yourself And Enfield like a lot of coaches have said yes foul up three with under 5 seconds or so And now thats the situation SMU by three 8 seconds and a timeout for the Mustangs Foul here Of course not in the act of shooting Florida State would be in the bonus It would be one and one for the Seminals McCrae to throw in instead Swinton Nice design here for McCrae And there is the foul with McCrae slightly turned away from the basket It was the right time one coming out for Robert McCrae V who has not shot a free throw in this game They did add almost a full second So 53 remaining and McCrae as much as he attacks the rim not a great foul shooter 68 One and one for McCrae missed the front end BUT A REBOUND BY WIGGINS FLORIDA STATE Its a tie up Boy time running out and the NLES have it thanks to the alternating possession One they can switch everything right now but you cant you dont want a foul in this situation Swinton to throw in 18 left turned by three Deflected by Washington and still Florida State ball out of bounds off the Mustangs jump ball Oh actually a tie up now Yes Changing possession If thats the case that should be SMU It should be SMU ball The possession error didnt change initially but it should thats correct right now Should be SNUs basketball right now Florida State just had it because of the arrow But youre right As we look across and is that way on screen a sworebug I dont believe the arrow had flipped It hadnt flipped but its the right Its the right Its in the right direction right now Yes Florida State just got the last possession right Based on the possession as well music So SMU with the ball now and under a second to play Dead ball situation here You cant move You just got to get this ball in bounds right now to close out the ball game music Pierre ready to throw in Luke Locks looking for that explanation from Clarence Armstrong music Yeah Coach Lock is not happy about about whats going on right now but youre still in position right now You can get a 5second if youre Florida State You want to face guard You want to deny the inbound pass coming in right now See if you cant get a 5sec count right now and get the ball back So you dont want to pick up a a a technical in this situation right now Youre still within striking distance but you got to turn them over right now with a uh with the 5second call If youre SMU you just got to get the ball in bounds right now Looked like they wanted a foul in that case Not the tie out into Miller Knocked out Is that THE END OF THE GAME IT IS SMU does get it in play and the Mustangs can exhale
