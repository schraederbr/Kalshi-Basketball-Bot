Virginia as a program has won three duke as a program has won 21 the most in ACC history outstanding officiating crew Roger ayersville Covington and Bert Smith admitting a game of this magnitude of Virginia as the higher seed they are in Home White Duke envisioning blue and the Blue Devils control the opening check every Speakman with his size and length taking Tyrese Crocker tonights starting lineups brought to you by CDW the same starting five Jeremy roach and The Four Freshmen in the starting lineup Purdue Kyle filipowski has had two magnificent games already in this tournament roach with a runner and Duke strikes first roach being guarded by Kihei Clark and anytime Jeremy roach can get to that right hand he can go left and hes effective but he is much better going to his right and youre going to see him in ball screen situations on the left side of the floor these two teams met about a month ago Virginia won in overtime more on that later as Beekman sneaks to the Baseline kicks to Clark and theyre using the entire shot clock as they often do Gardner out to Clark got it off in time hit the rim so now shot clock violation but it comes down to do well its usually Virginia that celebrates shot clock violations that time Duke making him use the entire clock Derek Lively the second oh he looked like he had a scene he went back and found it again Derek Lively the second his impact has been huge and not just because of his size he is a great shot blocker and rim protector can really run the floor and he is a lob threat he only played 10 minutes in the loss to Virginia back in February has become a bigger Factor late in the season Armon Franklin no and philipowski down to the rebound Franklin coming off that little fade screen and driving it he had 23 points in Charlottesville the last time these two teams played and has played well in this tournament as well Virginia has mentioned put on a clinic against Clemson in the semis beat him by 20 Duke had to work harder than that beat Miami by seven in the 70s after blowing out Pitt in The Quarters Virginia beat Carolina in the quarters in their first game Tyrese Proctor has played extremely well here in Greensboro leads this one short but how about the Hustle by Mark Mitchell Mark Mitchell has played so well over his last six or seven games very productive averaging about 13 points per game shooting over 55 percent from the field the Lebowski driving on Gardner lost it deflected out of bounds still Duke ball Derek live with second got the ball down low and he had an opening to the basket but didnt take it then got the same opening because capro didnt adjust his position to stay between Lively and the basket Music four on the shot clock Mitchell knows it air ball and its Virginia ball well block out by paparo on the weak side hes got a strength advantage and bulk advantage over Lively the second the life of the second is a better athlete on the wing Kihei Clark misses the three tipped out though by capro who gets the start in place of the injure to Ben vanderplas out for the duration of the season with a broken hand as Virginia does something they rarely do and thats turn it over and roach will lay it in and a terrific start for the Blue Devils so far the Blue Devils athleticism and their length has been bothersome to Virginia on the offensive end and Virginia really scored in the paint in the first game they played they had a 4224 paint Advantage for the Cavaliers teach them into Franklin and Franklin for free Virginia on the board well that penetration just a beautiful fade screen set by Francisco caporo to free up Armon Franklin hes ready to shoot he is a confident scorer Proctor lost his footing and got a timeout call so well step aside Blue Devils by three over the whos in the early going well Duke had 22 turnovers in Charlottesville in that one possession game that went to overtime and pal Philip house oh to the Blue Devils just the fourth first year ACC head coach to take his team to the final try to become the third along with Vic rubis and Bill guthridge to win the ACC tournament championship in his first season phillipowski open misses the three he has shot the ball exceedingly hes done a lot of things exceedingly well in the in this tournament so far misses that three hes such a difficult matchup and Jayden Gardner drew the assignment of having the guard philipowski and Gardner is only 66 filipowski seven feet tall Franklin he is shooting with a lot of confidence having a really good year the numbers back kind of where they were two years ago when he was with Indiana you mentioned the game he had against the Blue Devils a month ago in Charlottesville he has become a real weapon for Virginia he has settled in he knows where shots are coming from now and hes a purposeful cutter and his guards find him they know how to get the ball to him Lively the handoff for roach Falls loose Lively to the dick finds phillipowski who lays it in what a play by Lively not just to get on the deck and get the ball but have the presence of mind to find a teammate and who says he cant make an assist lying flat on your back route by five in the early going Applause Virginia the two seed Dukes the four seed coming in Eastman good defense by Proctor Clark is that little pocket pass but philipowski was there to stop Gardner from getting to the basket so Gardner had to step out maybe a step or two further than he would like and here come the Blue Devils in transition so difficult to get anything after a rebound in transition against Virginia they only send one maybe two to the offensive glass theyd rather take away your transition than take the chance of getting an offensive rebound finally puts it on the deck into the chest of caporo job by respeaking tonight phillipowski no capro did a good job just to stay stationary not commit a foul and back come the whos Beekman high off the glass capro the rebound and a foul when there is a loose ball first to the floor usually gets it thats a 5050 ball but Derek gladly the second turned it into a 7525 and a really smart pass to get at the philippowski for the score Music for Subs of the game caparo out Caden Shedrick and a guy who did not play a single minute into Virginias last two regular season games because of the injury to vanderplas he is back in the rotation and hes had two good games here in Greensburg hes really played well hes done a great job screening then playing off those screens and hes a little bit more athletic than top hero almost shot right there darik Whitehead whos also playing well right now for Duke in off the bench philipowski has sat down and theres a foul a tripping call there going against Virginia dont forget to check out our alternate angle of tonights game the New York Life Above the Rim cam streaming live on the ESPN app Whitehead in the game for Duke now he is an outstanding scorer had 16 points against Miami in the semifinal and Armon Franklins Guardian hes got to stay with him you cant be caught closing out to read Whitehead hes a good shooter now Whitehead has made 13 of his last 25 threes Clark will sit after picking up the foul just his first and freshman Isaac McNeely comes in a sharpshooter 40 from Beyond the arc on the season McNeely just a freshman really good at coming off screens ready to fire but now its his job to guard Whitehead everything around on the perimeter so far now turnover the conferences Defensive Player of the Year Reese Speakman with a steal and a layer a little bit awkward going up and Reese Speakman limping a little bit on the way back and grimacing to the bench Im okay lets keep going here Roach there was a lot of contact on that drive but no call Isaac McNeely heres Beekman just doing a great job reading the pass he knew where his man was but he was playing the ball and is landing a little bit awkward when he took off he looks like he just might have Twisted that ankle a bit when he was going up you can bet hell tough that out staying in the game again Kihei Clark is on the bench I think Tony Bennett is asking about the held ball there because the ball kind of stuck at the rim for a second and then dropped but they did rule at a held ball before the ball dropped so Virginia gets it on the alternating possession but now the Arrows going to do Applause Virginia is so difficult to guard with all of their movement they run their offense with Pace Duke switching certain exchanges now roach on Gardner Gardner the turnaround cant get it to go and Jacob Granderson down with a rebound the grad transfer from Illinois Applause with Ryan young in the game Shedrick has to be very mindful of the fact hes an excellent offensive rebounder and he does it with position gotta bump shoulders there with Shedrick created a little space the kick out to phillipowski 43 I dont think you want to double off of phillipowski on the ball side you try to dig down in the post when hes right at the threepoint line that was just an easy Inside Out Three and the Duke lead is up to six Virginia with Five Points seven and a half minutes in Gardner wont go out of bounds Duke ball The Gardener was wide open in the lane but ball pressure took away vision and if you recall yesterday against Clemson you know Virginia cut them up pretty good but part of that was there wasnt enough pressure on the ball right if you let the passer see you know a pass discouraged is just as good as a pass tonight and Duke is getting good pressure on the ball freshman Ryan Dunn out of Freeport New York into the game now to guard philipowski as Jaden Gardner has gone to the bench Ryan Dunn is an excellent Defender very athletic and long but theyre giving up some things offensively Whitehead spins off the back of the iron and the rebound down to Dunn right now in the lineup Armon Franklin is the one you have to be most concerned about and he will head to the line when we come back now Duke running some nice crisp offense they handled the double team in the post very well and the double team usually comes post to post but Gardner decided to come off philipowski and thats a long closeout after Ryan young makes the smart pass you know and coming in it was so close at the top of the lead Pitt had they beaten Miami and they lost by two in the last day of the regular season would have been the one seed instead they fell to the five seed Miami and Virginia with a cochance in the regular season but as this week has gone along there are a lot of good teams in this league but Duke has shown for about four or five weeks now they are getting better and better and Virginia you know what can you say theyre theyre Virginia right theyre just consistently good Virginia is just a tough out because they make you play differently its going to be a slower tempo they are theyre a rhythm disrupting team but Duke has established a pretty good Rhythm to start this game Young on the short roll in the middle ball screen but he turns it over boy you might have set a record for most ball fakes made about four or five probably could have gone up with the shot at some point Duke thus far in the game they struck a nice balance of getting pressure on the ball but still protecting the lane are they good for Gap protection and their length in size at just about every position has made it difficult for Virginia to get to the rim GA Clark is back in beachmans on the bench and Franklin turns it over Virginia one of the best in the country at not turning the ball over but theyve already turned it over three times tonight which in nine minutes thats a lot for Virginia well so far in the game Virginias seeing more bodies than they are would they havent really been able to stretch this out good save now that is an Up and Under yes it is Applause champ week rolls on on ESPN a little bit later on tonight the top two teams in the Pac12 Arizona and UCLA going at it its also available on ESPN app and two of the best players in the nation will be on the court of Jaime Hawkins Jr and azulus to Bellis Joe linardi has both of these as two seeds right now they might both wind up whos two seats tomorrow regardless of who wins who loses but so its for a championship out there but it also could be Jay maybe the winner stays West and the loser has to go to another part of the country who knows big picture what it all means well with with the Pod system they should both be out west foreign Music Applause Laughter Applause Virginias made two shots in nine and a half minutes two out of ten three turnovers they havent had many open ones and theyve been jumpers when theyve had openings Beekman the jumper itll go 137 Reese Speakman found it difficult to find open shots in the first game these two teams played he was two of 11 in Charlottesville but hes gonna have to score in this one he has done a remarkable job in recent games Distributing the ball 37 assists and four turnovers in his last five games coming into this round started by McNeely theyve got the switch on that extreme its more of a ghost stream for Lebowski with a gardener on him and the shot clock had one and a shot clock violation gives it back to the whos Virginia may be the only team in the country that gets a standing ovation from their fans on a shot clock violation and it is definitely the only team in the country where we can see how many shot clock violations they have forged in their game notes theyre great Eric John Bacher that is the 26th shot clock violation Force this year by Virginia Applause Proctor does a good job negotiating those streams theres a fade stream for Clark he should look but it wont go and back come the Blue Devils it was very good late pressure on that shot Applause the Hedge by Shedrick he recovers to get Lively villopowski and thatll be a goaltending call count the basket hit the backboard first and then Shedrick wiped it away pretty impressive stuff for a seven footer lets go to Holly well guys right now right now that Virginia is missing Ben Vander plaz a the broken hand he broke step drill in practice before the tournament started he had gone in in a small lineup and they had started clicking offensively when he got into that lineup thats how they played against Duke the last meeting not only that but he was a primary defender on philipowski that held him scoreless I see Ben talking to the guys trying to help them with positioning and stuff like that but I do think Virginia missing Ben right now trying to get their offensive rhythm they are different whether its Capital row or Shedrick in there Shedrick the best shot Blocker of the three capro the biggest body of the three but theres no question they lose some offense Mitchell had it and lost it and its Virginia ball well without Penn founder Plus in the game and available well Virginias not able to spread the court as much with that smaller lineup knocked away looked like as Clark was elevating with the layup he tripped over somebody and fell at the same time Cedric The Rebound and Gardner wide open 12 feet away knocks it down but that offensive rebound shows the presence of Dukes length and shot blocking ability Shedrick was right next to the basket but thought better of going up in that crowd just kicked it back out for a short jumper Jade Gardner such a good midrange shooter averaging better than 17 points per game his last six Virginia is going to have to hit some perimeter shots they are finding it very difficult to score in the lane against this Duke defense Lively into Mitchell got a bit of a size Advantage theres the double and theres the floss from Lively the double team was small and able to see right over the top of it and Derek Lively did a really nice job of getting to the front of the rim and you made the Point Duke is bigger at every spot on the floor one through five McNeely knocks one down you really have to chase these Cutters and Trail them on their outside hip so that they have to curl because theyre curling right into Dukes size in their rim protector make them make the contested two even if its close in above your shot blockers Roach short Virginia looks like theyre finding a bit of a rhythm now with the offensive end straight trailing Duke by six McNeely again Applause Clark gets another good look in and out and a foul call against Gardner Virginias struggling from Beyond The Arc and Duke with a sixpoint lead 645 to go in the first half well Virginia likes to double in the post but they got a switch and he got McNeely on Mitchell they come with the double but it wasnt a big double 54 hours from now some great performances on the court this week here in Greensboro the 29th time out of 70 years this tournament has been played here and its dupleting Virginia by six here in the championship game Applause Music Applause stupid is really spreading the floor and that is stretching out this defense Mitchell Cuts hangs had it knocked away and its Virginia ball team Murray is into the game for the first time number 10 for the whos a 65 sophomore from Upland New Zealand had hardly played for about six weeks came in last night Jay knocked out a couple of shots they went 13 in the first half I thought the one in the second half was a three well as well but they called it a two but he had been one for 11 from threepoint range on the season before he hit those two shots done too strong Virginia now five for 19 thats 26 percent and just one for six from threepoint range well theyre not getting anything in the lane Duke has covered things up but look how spread the floor is for Duke theyre moving it from side to side and to your point about Virginia getting into the lane they have scored a ton of points recently in the paint theyve only got four points in the paint in this game you remember they had over 40 in the paint in Charlottesville in that win in overtime overdue but Dukes length especially with Derek Lively the second in the game you know if you force all these Cutters to curl off screens theyre curling right into Dukes size over there Applause Music roach on Beekman shot clock inside 10 McNeely guarded well by Whitehead has to drive it has to kick it Gardner for three and the rebound down to Roach The Whos now one for seven from Beyond the yard on the last two possessions if you could if Duke could have chosen who to shoot it they would have chosen a three from Jaden Gardner and then a jumper from 17 feet from Ryan Dunn gardener about taking the three is not really part of the Virginia offense for him a great midrange shooter and that was just his third threepoint attempt of the season long two for Whitehead and you see glimpses hes had injuries at the beginning of the Season than a leg injury in the middle of the year and coming off the bench for Duke but the talent is obvious and seeing more and more glimpses of his ability I was going to say he had 16 points that was better than a glints like that dude is a bucket getter and he gets him in all three levels thats not an easy shot he just made and another Virginia turnover therefore Jeremy roach got switched off onto Jaden Gardner and just fought him he got low and used his leverage even though he was behind and there was a little bit of pressure on Beekman and threw the ball out of bounds so far its been Dukes defense that has really disrupted the rhythm of Virginia usually Virginia is the Rhythm disrupter but I think Duke being able to spread the floor so effectively has spread out this pack line defense they cant pack it running some offense through Lively looking into filipowski theres the double theres the kick Proctor for three Phillip houski can just turn and see right over the double team and John Shire talked to us before the game in the matchup in Charlottesville thought filipowski was maybe rushing a little bit with the double as you said he can see over it and hes made some nice decisions out of the double here tonight he committed five turnovers in that game and was held scoreless Clark turns it over grandison just took it right away from him and is fouled by Dunn nice Euro Step there by Jacob grandison the transfer from Illinois whos an excellent Corner threepoint shooter ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is brought to you by principal when you take care of your team they take care of business Music at the half the AllState halftime report recently the guys will tell you about what went on in the SEC as Vandy lost to a m and into the championship game to play Alabama and in the Big 12 how about Texas in the title game dominating Kansas and we got to get Reese in the guys and youre one of the guys in this context up to ESPN for everything going on tomorrow so special thanks to our friends Ed wheels up for providing plane transportation for the ACC tournament and I understand the reservation it wheels up is actually made under recently guys thats how it thats how it looks you realize that was for advertising purposes only that weve got tickets booked on a Greyhound bus leaving Greensboro at 11 pm and then we lose an hour with Daylight Savings Time correct so we are going to be Im going to be in a coach seat on the dirty dog next to a screaming baby Im a little gullible but Im going to call you out on this its true Im telling you lets go to Holly but I dont know how to follow up with that at all I was listening into that last Virginia huddle I am told that it is important for them to do a better job with the post trap right now theyre bailing out of it not getting a good double team in the post that was effective in their last meeting theyve just got to be a little more strong with it also unforced turnovers theyre not making theyre making too many mistakes its uncharacteristic uncharacteristic for Virginia weve gone about four and a half minutes since they last scored deflection by Whitehead and another Virginia turnover blocked by Shedrick terrific play lapowski drew the contact but the block was up top good defense by Shedrick really what Virginia needs is to make a shot and another steal Whitehead ahead to Granderson and hes fouled by Beekman an intelligent play by Reese Speakman just to avoid giving up a layup but Dukes pressure its length and protecting the lane like in years past there was a switch there so Tariq Whitehead got switched off onto Jaden Gardner but did a good job of breaking contact to get around to knock that ball away to get the deflection but in years past Duke might be a team thatd get out in passing Lanes it forced a lot of turnovers with their pressure this year theyre more a gap Protection Team and with their size they can protect the lane protect the rim and put Lake pressure on shots and force you to shoot it over the top and Virginias having zero success getting the ball into the lane and scoring and again if you havent seen the Blue Devils in say the second half of the season they are a distinctly different team than they were six eight weeks ago the loss in overtime in Charlottesville the last loss they suffered eight in a row since then Whitehead rattles in and out Joe lapowski with Apollo Applause himself on the weak side shot comes from essentially the right corner most rebounds are going to go long and he muscled that basket and the Duke fans who appear to comprise the majority loving what theyre seeing a desperately needed bucket for Virginia thanks to Reese Speakman and he Speakman just got an angle to the basket and a creative finisher but one of the few times that Duke hasnt had length near the basket to bother a drive look how spread out the Virginia Defense as it stretched the entire 50 feet of the floor but still they get a deflection and a turnover weve said this on a few occasions feels like a big last minute and a half year of the first half and Virginia cut into their step to six Mark will go to the line but Virginia has had some openings with that little fade screen on a ball reversal and that time Kihei Clark rather than take the shot just got a little ball screen rub screen where he could get into the lane and decided to go off one foot to get that shot up and got fouled he hit Clark fifth year senior averages 11 points per game scoreless so far tonight well cap off champ week tomorrow with a couple more championship games on ESPN and the app itll be a m and Alabama in the SEC Championship at one oclock Eastern and then also one and two in the America with Houston and Memphis at 3 15 Eastern remember everybody says its gonna be so crazy Anything Can Happen theyre all number one and two two we had shop here in the 70s one two three four dont have Chalk in the final tickets punched today including Texas Southern the number eight seed in the swac which is headed to Dayton headed to the big games Texas Southern has lost 20 games in their NCAA tournament a foul called on Kaden Shedrick philipowski when he came off that lane line backpick went right into the chest of Kaden shedra and Drew that contact and Shedrick still once he got that contact is able to get off his feet and make that block but hed already committed the foul apowski in the quarters against Pitt 22 points in 16 minutes rolled his ankle they had a big lead so Jon Shire didnt have to play him much in the second half in the semis last night against Miami 17 points 11 rebounds five assists and hes already got 11 points Jay in this one thats MVP stuff Kyle filipowski there have been a number of players that have been major contributors to Dukes success but no one more than pal filipowski hes such a committed rebounder at both ends of the floor Franklin cant get the shot off over the size of Mitchell discouraged him I want beefman curled that screen Derek Gladden is second waiting with him he knows Cafaro is not going to make a perimeter shot Gardner its 66 over the seven footer in phillipowski and a foul is called and for philipowski itll be his second and with Derek Lively able to play basically a oneman Zone in the middle of the lane thats where you notice that Ben vanderplas is not available because hed be able to space the floor you got to worry about him knocking down a three so youd probably have Derek live with the second guarding Jaden Gardner and thats a lot different hes got to pay more attention to Gardner that hes got to pay to kafarer in the game so with two on philipowski he sits Gardner at the line told you about philipowskis numbers this week how about gardeners had 17 and 10 in the quarters against Carolina had 23 and 12 last night against Clemson Clemsons a really good defensive team and theyve got size as well but Virginia just cut up the Tigers with their movement their screening got anything they wanted its really impressive to watch roach draws a crowd needs some help this forces it up no a fivesecond call before the shot at him so its back to the whos I was thinking are they coming by twos out there I mean one Mississippi yeah two Mississippi you dont see many five second calls that was more it seemed like more than five seconds so 117 for Virginia to try to cut into the deficit Applause and Duke with a couple of fouls to give theyll give one there interesting though the second on Proctor you might want to get Proctor out of there time out Tony Bennett Duke 24 Virginia 16 Cavs ball when do we come back Elsie is a saint and Luke Hancock wore his Ron Burgundy coat last night now he looks like a banker Applause 64 to go in the half Applause Gardner to the rim no call and then a foul will send Armand Franklin to the line Gardner took it hard off that Keeper at the left elbow and Derek Lively just sent it back yeah thats a foul we should have got that call but Armon Franklin got it there but you know Dan I know Tony Bennett was talking about tightening up their post traps I mean for friend out loud theyve held Duke to 24 points the problems not their defense problems in fact as Virginia cant score I mean Dukes defense has been excellent and you give you give all the credit to Duke but Virginias only scored 16 points with Armon Franklin having a chance to increase that here shooting only 27 percent and they turned it over seven times tonight they average eight and a half per game so they have not looked like themselves offense and thats part of the issue you know anytime you play against a great defensive team both of these are great defensive teams your offense has to help your defense you turn the ball over you cannot guard a run out and Dukes had several runoffs in this game Rochester in the first half comes to a close with Duke up by seven well with scoring first half not surprisingly for Virginia here this half John shires got a lot to be happy about but it is a fairly close game still Duke 24 Virginia 17 halfway through here in the championship game at the ACC tournament in Greensboro Bobby Rose with John shot 27 theyre only three possessions down this is still is a close game Holly Rowe had a chance to speak with Tony Bennett at halftime well coach Bennett turnovers is just so uncharacteristic for them theyve got to hold on to the basketball play with a little bit more toys and composure thats what they normally do he also said that theyve gotten quality looks they just havent hit them theyve got to start playing with a little more confidence offensively but he said we live and breathe on the defensive end he said weve only held him to 24 weve done a good job there but now we have got to take care of the ball and make the most of our possession they definitely have to do that thanks Holly they also have to figure out a way to slow down Kyle filipowski again how about a guy his age his size making the plays hes making from the elbow he has been so aggressive getting into the pain to the rim in this tournament Franklin with a great shot fake and he knocks down the three they talk about Poise that was a poised play with the shot clock going down the shop fake sidestep Kyle filipowski John Shire ran a play for him on the left elbow so he can get that right hand it got all the way to the basket with it Kaden Shedrick starts the second half for Virginia instead of Francisco papparo just gives some more athleticism and a little bit better of a score what a split at that all right a little bit too strong off the glass by Roach did a great job to get there well again Virginias got to make some shots and they ran the shot clock right down until the end Armon Franklin didnt panic and buried it on a short clock situation and a great pass when Reese Speakman drew two Defenders Applause chair of UVA now going to be heard their fans have been pretty quiet so far tonight DJ Clark under the bucket comes out the other side hands it off to Shedrick and its over to Duke well theres so much body contact Shedrick got hit when he was going up with it and lost the ball but Virginia with all the problems on the offensive end not able to get a bucket turn it over seven times theyre down just two possessions this is the type of grinded out game that Virginia lives in Applause rocker who took over the vast majority the ball handling duties when Jeremy roach went out with the injury it stayed that way since roach has come back roach into more of a Spurs role since and he knocks down the three that was a heck of a play by Derek Lively II set the high ball screen in the slot almost a flat ball screen and he slipped out of it early and then they got hit on the short roll thats not an easy play Shedrick up strong and thatll be the third foul on Derrick Lively the second now watch Lively after he exits this screen sets a little screen slipped out of it and Kihei Clark has to stop him on the roll but got hit with that short roll a lot of big guys will walk with that but he read it very well and got it to Jeremy roach thats tough for Kihei Clark hes got to stop the roll then recover to a corner shooter on a closeout third on lively John Shire takes him out Ryan Young comes in one now philipowski the primary rim protector Ryan young even though he can block a shot is more of a lane protector and on the grad transfer from Northwestern getting ready to head to the NCAA tournament for the first time in his career Speakman put such great pressure on the ball youre worried about him instead of worried about running offense nice pass from Young down to philipowski couldnt finish it but it stays with the Blue Devils Applause weve just had so many they have so many weapons on the floor roach boy in another soft bounce for Jeremy Roach he is such a good midrange shooter and that little short Corner jumper even though its a short shot its not an easy one and again look at all the bodies is that Duke has in the lane making things tough for the who take a look at Jeremy roach here they run three across with Kyle felipowski up top he comes off that double catches it gives a little fake and Kihei Clark goes behind him and he gets a little short midrange jumper play out of the same alignment quite often and you dont know exactly what theyre going to do is it going to be an upstream youre coming off the Stagger is it screened for the screener knocked Away by phillipowski and roach fumbled it off his knee out of bounds and he was saying to phillipowski I was getting ready to give it back to you big fella but Duke cant convert that is really uncharacteristic just a guard to guard pass by Kihei Clark and philipowski got that left arm in the passing Lane so Virginias now turned it over more tonight than they averaged on a per game basis during the season shetric couldnt finish it stolen by Beekman Clark wont go and philipowski the rebound Clark trying to get the contact what a steal by Reese Beekman and hes like a free safety that reads the eyes of the quarterback and again the accs defensive player of the year this year a little surprise that Jeremy Rose didnt use that throw and get ball screen when he can get to that right hand hes so good doctor step back three Gardner the rebound Applause Beekman a little space in and out and rebound number seven for filipowski make it eighth for Kyle filipowski tonight those are the open shots that are deflating when Virginia misses them because they havent gotten that many open shots Dr fouled on his way to the rim Duke has extended the lead by a bucket in the first 448 of the second half that he would join and Mike shazewski Dean Smith of course way ahead of the group of some great names on that list Holly Road with a little background on how Tony Bennett first became intimately familiar with this tournament Hollywood well you know he went to Wisconsin Green Bay and didnt really know that much about the ACC in his college days but he came down here he was playing for the Charlotte Hornets and a buddy of his took him to the 1995 ACC tournament and he said I got there I I was with my girlfriend at the time who is now his wife we were sitting there and hes like oh this is different said I grew up in Big Ten country in that kind of neck of the woods and I just knew this passion for this tournament in this part of the country is as great as its ever been he said now I dont take a moment of it for granted especially when we won it back in 2014 he said these are the moments you live for he is fired up about what just happened under the bucket 1995 here in Greensboro thats when the Great Randolph Childers just went off and had an unbelievable week and back in 1995 there was no Big Ten tournament yet so he lived in Big Ten country Tony Bennett came down here when he was living and playing in Charlotte and Im sure like you Jay the first time you saw this tournament in person and he was just kind of Blown Away by it yeah once you experience it the first time I saw it was as a player right I mean you saw it on television but that thats not quite the same as being here and especially back then when it was eight teams and everybody played on Friday the Friday ticket for the ACC tournament was the toughest ticket in the South next to the masses with a three and the Blue Devils have their largest lead of the game well when a shot goes down it seems like the offense is clicking but whats been most impressive about dude this defensive effort has been magnificent Franklin no Shedrick to save that was a tightrope block by Hayden Shedrick where does the offense come from for Virginia if theyre going to get back into it well thats one way just keep working well that was a great second effort by Kaden Shedrick tough to even make that catch off the little bounce pass to the middle of the lane but hes stuck with it and corralled that ball the little pocket pass went right off his knees but he got it and got fouled by philipowski going up and still was able to make the shot through the contact the foul the Third on Kyle kolapowski whos been great tonight and John Shire is going to take him out at least for a bit Mark Mitchell back in So philipowski and Lively Jay both on the bench right now Purdue and thats an opportunity now for Virginia to attack the lane its not that Mark Mitchell and Ryan young are not good Defenders they are good Defenders but they dont have the kind of length and shot blocking ability that you have with Lively and philipowski Mitchell cant get by Gardner now back out to Roach whos already got a dozen tonight young drives and is called for the offensive foul his second I think John Shire looking at Ryan young saying what are you doing Applause just lowered that shoulder and went right into the chest of Kaden Shedrick now young sits and Lively is back in the game playing with three Applause Franklin Gardner the Finish as crisp as the offenses looked in a long time for Virginia to the point where John Shire wants a timeout well John Shire is not happy with that call that went against Ryan young he didnt feel that should have been an offensive foul but a great play by Armon Franklin drawing Derek Lively to block the shot and he just drops it off Duke didnt rotate and the easiest basket of the night but look how alive to prep you for the day at six oclock Eastern Reese so the guys take a look at the mens field of 68 Bracketology breaking it down at seven Eastern the womens selection special at eight Eastern and then at 10 Eastern even more coverage of both brackets again our special thanks to our friends who wheels up for providing plane transportation for the ACC tournament to get all of our analysts and hosts and everybody else who is helping along with all the coverage this week back to Connecticut in time to bring it all your way tomorrow Dan you know what an admirer I am of yours but this Reese and the guys thing has to end we have names let me take yours now to start and yours is yeah Reeses eyes light up when you when you say you know I might go with some of guys tonight found some Seth not So Much by Franklin what a play roach is so good off ball screens when he goes to that right hand and Franklin just timed that beautifully and blocked it right out of his hands it feels like a big possession for Virginia Applause done not really a shooter so he doesnt take the corner three dribbles it in kicks it back out Applause more effective in here but he left it short and an empty trip for Virginia where they really had a couple of good things happening yeah just a beautiful pass Dunn just couldnt finish it and you wonder if theres some footsteps that you hear as you get near the basket with Lively in the game and thats where you feel maybe the loss of vanderplas right if thats standing in the corner Lively strong to the rim and he is fouled with an open side he exits those ball screens so quickly to roll to the basket and that was just a beautiful pocket pass to Derek Lively the second watch how quickly he sets the screen and exits out of it and opens up just a beautiful pass out of the open Side open Corner ball screen action okay Kyle philipowski has been tremendous again tonight as we check tonights game track brought to you by Audi this is three really good games in a row for filipowski in this tournament and this ones got to feel particularly the good Jay because of what a struggle it was for him a month ago in Charlottesville yeah I think it was the only goose egg hes had on the season but certainly understandable when you play for the first time against Virginia its a shock to the system and having that experience of having gone through it is certainly beneficial and for those that say you cant win with freshmen I think Duke has proven that wrong in the past as has Kentucky been this team is certainly proving it wrong if you hey Clark back into the game after shooting about three and a half minutes for Virginia Whitehead his second the sixth on the team so next one would send the whos to the line where they are not a great freethrow shooting team Duke is a far superior freethrow shooting team theyre at 77 percent of the season of Virginias at 70 and usually when you play against Virginia its not a high volume freethrow game Virginia needs to see the ball go through the net I mean theyve continued to guard and thats whats impressive I mean holding Duke to 36 to this point in the game is impressive but they just cant seem to get a score and Clark having a tough night that one wouldnt go down he still has not made a field goal in this game he is 0 for seven from the floor but with Clark when he drives you want to make him finish and especially because of Dukes size and length around the rim make him finish a tough two over somebody but if you overhelp on him hes such a good passer he can spray it and then they can attack but Dukes done a really good job defensively in this game protecting the rim protecting the lane Mitchell Lively another try kicks it out to Roach offensive rebounding has been a staple all year long one of the top five offensive rebounding teams in the country theyve run a lot through filipowski tonight for a tough one this is the three rebound Franklin Virginia not a transition offensive team unless its off of a turnover theres just nowhere to go yeah usually that pass would be open but Tariq Whitehead Kyle filipowski right there and no chance to take the shot for Beekman because Lively was towering over 10 turnovers now committed by Virginia average about nine on the season took 10 minutes to go in regulation right hand for three still watch the time almost 10 minutes to go but the clock moves quickly into Virginia games and there used to be enough theyre down right now and this one have been behind most of the night and still struggling from Beyond The Arc now two for nine and Beekman was wide open off that weak side fade screen action but damn this is where Virginia misses Ben founder plus they have a guy that can play the four the five that can make threes Mitchell into filipowski and the lead grows to 11 its the Low cross green philipowski open on the left block Music take a look at the look youre going to see Jeremy roach set a little on big Low cross screen and Jaden Gardner tries to go over the top of it you cant switch it because that would put Kihei Clark on Kyle philipowski that would be somewhat an advantage for Philadelphia inside but theres Ben Von der plas best mustache in college basketball okay he could be the Marlboro Man that should be his nil deal Applause thats pretty good too I think its fake man Beekman at the line for Virginia big picture just for a moment both of these teams kind of look like theyre in the four or five range for a seed maybe the winner gets a four loser gets five who knows but just a little Side Story theres a subregional first and second round right in this building and of course both of these teams would love to be here and as you pointed out in a different context because of the Pod system its possible both of them could be here but you got a better shot of being here as a four then a five the NCAA tournament selection committee the top seeds they try to keep them closer to home as a reward let their fans come see them and and you know both coaches would love to be back here in a few days Applause yeah well Defender cross green screen what a cut by Proctor done down with a rebound for Virginia the give and go still works just didnt finish it a really nice pass by Young McNeely usually that would have been a pocket pass to cap around McNeely a good look yes and all of a sudden its a sixpoint game Virginia just keeps grinding and you have to be impressed with the offensive difficulties that Virginia has had that theyve continued to guard Applause McNeely makes the makes the pass and then he goes off a little fade screen and they just lost him and Proctor trying to recover late and give help and Tony Bennett imploring his team to keep defending thats what they do and these are the type of games that Virginia plays in lower scoring possession oriented again phillipowski bums no call Proctor for three got it how did he find him that was a Next Level pass by philipowski whos playing well in every aspect of the game tonight Franklin Way off on the three but Dunns got it shot clock does not reset it to 12 Franklin knocked Away by who else philipowski what a tournament hes having Jay heres the Low cross street and the pass double team a twohanded pass across Court under the basket to the Freshman Tyrese Proctor and then Duke when challenged answers again with its defense turning defense into offense and Kyle filipowski has at least one hand on that MVP trophy but still seven and a half to go in regulation its not decided yet head coach of any program let alone the Duke Blue Devils which was an incredible player and you are you on his you this is the finest job Ive ever seen in the first year of a head coaching in my 30 years of covering basketball he had an impossible task and look what hes doing this is impressive parents looking on with pride Im sure John still looks he is a young man hes 35 years old but he looks younger than that taking over of course for Mike shazewski well you know to Mike Krzyzewski now here he is with his team up 10 at the moment with 7 21 to go in the ACC Championship game looking at a a very nice seed in the NCAA tournament well John Shire did have some head coaching experience at coach Ks Fantasy Camp the K Academy but he was coaching 50 and 60 year olds so he had to take time out for Pedialyte breaks right yeah so his players could call their brokers did you coach against him were you a coach in that League I did I probably have the worst record in that because I was afraid some of my players would die Applause nine point lead Applause and again the story tonight has been Kyle filipowski 17 points nine rebounds three steals guys soon to have his 15th DoubleDouble on the season no other freshmans done that again a guy his size hes just making every kind of play you could make all over the court right now oh the biggest point in the game for Dukes again that fade screen and look you have to pass out of it he cant get all the way to the basket to look for his offense very often young down with a Rebound Physical defense by Ryan Young but about the eight minute Mark to go in the game when philipowski made that pass to Proctor and then got the steal it was a sixpoint game and then all of a sudden it was 11 that might have been a Backbreaker misses the three and immediately kind of looks over to the bench to say thats on me I shouldnt have taken that shot great footwork a little drop step after faking into the middle of the lane and getting done to adjust his position gets on the high side just a bit and then he drops steps to the basket just beautiful footwork for the seven foot Freshmen what a difference in points in the paint 40 points in the paint for Virginia in the first game only 10 in this one Mega 12 has done scores off the assist from Beekman so right now Tony Bennett has gone small with Dunn and Gardner up front and then hes got Clark Beekman and looking for some outside shooting from McNeely Applause keeping the floor spread going essentially high low with young and philipowski the Wachowski turns it over clark is fouled and will shoot a couple the foul going on Mitchell they got the second foul there and that probably was better for Kihei Clark he got fouled earlier just didnt get called but this way he shoots two free throws instead of taking the ball out of bounds or actually would have been one one and one theres more action coming your way next the Pac12 championship top seed UCLA two seed Arizona 10 30 Eastern time tonight Maxwell Championship presented by New York Life right here on ESPN and also available on the ESPN app terrified Lively returns and there is still plenty of time in this game for Virginia and thats why being strong with the ball philipowski brought the ball down showed it well you show it to Reese feet manner Kihei Clark theyre going to take it down to seven Applause Proctor Andrew the paint blocks done got it plugged for three and its just not been Kihei Clarks night so far now o for eight oh for four from threepoint range what an opportunity after just an amazing defensive play to get something in transition now Rose splits the double it wont go but hes fouled Jeremy roach so good going to his right Applause even though youre trying to take away that right hand to limit those righthand drives hes still able to get to it were back at halftime Holly Rowe gave us a report she had spoken to Tony Bennett one of the things that Holly reported from coach Bennett was theyre getting some looks theyre just not knocking down the shots they normally do unfortunately for Virginia that has continued in the second half and I just watched Kihei Clark during those free throws visibly frustrated that hes missing shots he normally makes well especially that last one I mean they have been getting some shots but the truth is not very many and theyre certainly not getting much at The Rim you know against Clemson theyre running Clemson off all these screens getting layoffs so that has not been available in this game and even there youre taking the shot over Derek Lively the second and theres the double double for philipowski his 16th on the season defense Mike Clark to take away that right hand drive turning the corner should save him the Lebowski steps in Clark has it for Virginia somehow its kept in bounds and a broken play turns into a bucket what a save by Reese Beekman not only did he keep the ball from going out of bounds he saved it to a teammate to Ryan Dunn and I guess Ryan Dunn I thought maybe he might have double dribbled but I guess he just a ball hit the deck when hes trying to catch him as it often goes into Virginia games that clock just keeps on running John Shire will slow it down into the timeout here with 3 35 to go and Duke leading by seven Virginia with an opportunity on a semi break and it looked as if they might have thrown the ball away got tipped and Beekman able to save it but how about this saving it to Ryan Dunn couples with a seven point lead on Tony Bennetts hands with 3 35 to go duke ball Applause Roche trying to get by Kihei Clark Fade Away got it Applause Clark was slapping at the ball almost got a piece of it what a big time shot by Jeremy Rhodes both philipowski and roach have been excellent roach now with 16 McNeely with a three and its a sixpoint game with three minutes to go thats what he is in there to do now Virginia bringing full court pressure foul on Clark thatll be the sixth team foul on Virginia Isaac McNeely The Freshman from West Virginia just gets a little wide pin down and Derek Lively II didnt get out to put a hand up Jeremy roach going to his left watch what Beekman excuse me Clark almost got that ball when he was bringing it up to shoot it its a strong move by Jeremy roach roach averaging 13 now has 18 in this game finishing through contact going to his right what a big time play by Jeremy Roach that puts him at 18 points now with a chance to tie filipowski for the team scoring lead in this game with 19 and he never took his eyes off the rim and again early in the year hes doing a little bit more of the ball handling Proctors off the ball a little bit more the injury to Roach the rolls kind of switch and roach has been as he always was very important but in more of a scores role in the second half of the year for the Blue Devils Mark Mitchell on McNeely thats a lot of length theres the fade stream gets the shot on around and out and roach Has It produced it looked like Ryan Dunn had a inside track for that ball but philipowski knocked it out the Blue Devils looking for their ninth consecutive win playing their best basketball of the season right now and inside two minutes to go up by nine as they turn it over numbers for Virginia Beekman will finish its a seven point game timeout Tony Bennett and thats been Virginias game in this one the only easy baskets are when they force a turnover and get well in spurts here and there tonight the hoos have looked like themselves good hands by Clark steal by Beekman hell finish it at the other end theyve generated a little bit of offense off their defense Jay its just in the half court five on five they have not been able to get enough decent looks it has been so difficult to get open shots theyve gotten a little bit from the threepoint line off those fade screens on the weak side but anything around the basket has been challenged and really really difficult Duke has just shut off the lane with their length their athleticism and their Gap protection Applause a minute 48 to go duke ball now its about being strong with the ball and you cant cross over in front of either Clark or Beekman and if you try to move to turn your back and make an inside hand change Kihei Clark really good at reaching around and getting a steal roach and Proctor both very solid for the ball Proctor plays with a Poise Beyond his years remember he reclassified should be a high school senior any drive to the basket while hes in that dunker spots are alive roach cant get it to go Virginia ball with a minute 20 to go Boy Tough catch almost turned over Clark with his first field goal of the night and its a fivepoint game its almost like the broken play was a benefit one minute to go and a foul deep in the corner will send philipowski to the line for one and one hes almost an 80 percent freethrow shooter in the top 15 in the ACC elipowski has played 34 minutes tonight remember back on Thursday against Pittsburgh he rolled his ankle in the first half and weve seen five or six of those from various players on various teams in this tournament you never quite know how serious it is in the moment but he came back in that game got some rest in the second half because Duke had such a big lead played great in the semis last night against Miami and then having an equally impressive game here in the championship but he missed it and it belongs to two but theyre going to look at it it looked like it looked like Lively hit done and a little surprised that a foul wasnt called there I guess thats incidental contact and they cant look at whether there should have been a foul its just who did the ball go off of here and I didnt see anybody get a finger on it looked like Dunn just tried to save it after he got hit and now watch Lively here hes kind of riding him out and I thought that could have easily been called a foul and now did it hit lively thats the issue and it looked like it changed Direction now did it hit Lively right here no its uh hard to see it on that angle but the officials may get more with this DB sport replay than we can get even though it comes from all the same cameras and again the call on the floor is dewfall so they would need some pretty strong evidence in their minds to overturn that was an awful lot of contact Applause foreign and the call Will Stand its Dukes ball Applause the officials trying to get the teams back on the court coach is using the opportunity to get a free time out here the whistles continue to blow as the officials are trying to get him here comes Virginia first and the coaches are saying hey I wasnt watching TV Music as duke comes out of the Huddle again Four Freshmen on the court but Four Freshmen each of whom in his own way Jay has grown over the course of the Season again a different team from what they were the first half of the year yeah four super talented Freshmen but you know what there were so many guys at Duke had that were out I mean Derek Lively is second out early in the season Tariq Whitehead unavailable for a good part of the early early season theyve had continuity lately theyve had an entire lineup together entire team together and that way they can develop together theres the great Mike to George tells us in the game notes they are 171 when they are a fully healthy team this year you didnt do your homework you dont know his middle name no he gave us I know dont know mites the Lebowski missed the front end moments ago thats where free throw blackouts are really big deals if there is a miss and Duke is long and athletic in that second slot going against Ryan Dunn and arm on Franklin and its not just grabbing the rebound if Duke County if there is a Miss they could tap it back out so Kihei Clark has to be alert back there too John shires parents among the Duke fans looking on here in Greensboro Marcel one of two two possession game from the drive its down to four 44 seconds to go beautiful use of the rim to avoid the block shot by philipowski the lapowski gets rid of it and roach will let a few more seconds tick away and then hell go to the freethrow line he hit Derek Lively for the law but an intelligent decision by Jeremy roach to hold the ball just take the foul and now its double bonus for a 75 free throw shooter on the season the roach has been outstanding and really the two guys that carried the scoring load for Duke have been filipowski and Jeremy roach others have contributed but Im telling you that eight minute Mark when philipowski made that pass to Proctor for the three and then the steal and the dunk that was the biggest moment of the game those two players you just mentioned have 41 of dukes 55 McNeely tough step back three short rebound roots and hell go to the line again and the Blue Devils are on the verge of a championship this Duke team was built on defense the foundation is defense and it emerged as an outstanding offensive rebounding team but once healthy in the last eight games or so really really it started in the game at Virginia in a game that came down to a controversial call at the end but I think the patience of the Duke coaching staff led by John Shire and the mature approach to let this team develop and keep everybody in it has really been one of the most impressive things of the season Franklin and as we said last night their seed may not reflect their current level because they did struggle some midseason like say there before I dont know if this is the four you want to get when youre a one who knows how it turns out but every every team wants to be ascending into the NCAA tournament and the Blue Devils are certainly doing that well its got to be a very confident team goals have been defined but this is one impressive defensive team whose offense has really blossomed over the course of this tournament Music Beekman misses it live at least got it and no point in fouling anymore the Duke Blue Devils will win the ACC tournament championship for the 22nd time as they beat Virginia by 10 Music Applause oh beating Pittsburgh Miami and Virginia on consecutive
