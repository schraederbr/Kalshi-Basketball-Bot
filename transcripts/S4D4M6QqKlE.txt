Dental Tire the smart choice in tires we are just about set for tipoff Miami and Saint Francis as Isaiah Wong retakes the floor theres a change though in the starting lineup for Miami Nigel pack the transfer from Kansas state is out today hes under the weather did not practice yesterday so Miami for the first time this season has a different starting five for Jim larenega Bensley Joseph makes his first career start and we are underway from inside the watsco center the red Flash and the hurricanes Miamis got Virginia coming up on this court on Tuesday if they try to get to 111 on the way there and the twonothing lead courtesy Nicaraguan sensation George had omir one of the challenges for Saint Francis will be handling the pressure of Miamis defense and it is tremendous ball pressures you see right there with Bensley Joseph on the ball what do you think this feels like for Mr Joseph hes come off the bench 47 straight games and he gets his name announced gets the start today and a nice take from Saint Francis his freshman landed more to tie the ball game I think hes excited and I think once he gets a lather up I think hell have an impact on this game because hes a very good on ball Defender step back long short its a big challenge for Saint Francis will be keeping Miami in front keeping them from scoring easy buckets in transition keeping them off the freethrow line and getting Josh Cohen right here with the ball getting him established talked about Cohen in the open hes a junior from New Jersey leads his conference in scoring is 11th in the nation at 214 points per game that has helped out by a couple of 40 burgers including most recently against Hawaii this past Sunday Landon Moore had the first two kicks it up for McCabe and Saint Francis jumps in front do not be deceived by this record the northeastern conference plays a lot of what we would call money games guarantee games nobody in their league except for one team has a 500 record right now its just the nature of nonconference play in the Northeast conference this is a good basketball team yep they were tight with Hawaii into the latter stage into the second half before the Warriors turned it on late on that game 9066 another three this time from mourn short rebounded by Jordan Millers having one heck of the season coming off a 25point game last Saturday Bensley Joseph to the basket thats the explosive Music but Francis gets back and builds their defense yet the explosiveness of Joseph allows him to get all the way on a straight line drive hes quick Pearson feisty Defender its gonna be a fun matchup to watch Cohen and omir Saint Francis now one for three from Beyond The Arc but the first offensive rebound of the game creates another possession Applause pretty good defense by omir on the drive and heres Wong the other way to the corner Poplar rebound omir and Wongs pass intercepted by cam Gregory Saint Francis coached by Rob krimmel the red flash lifer and thats not exactly what uh Josh Cohen has faced every game this year a guy like omir inside look at Wong come from the weak side great anticipation oh I gotta tie my shoe after I do that I mean come on theyre gonna play him straight up right so theyre relying on some backside help thats the way you start the game and you make an adjustment if you need to Landon Moore pulls up and Banks it home his second bucket landed Moore off to a very hot star hits a three gets to the midrange right now Miamis just playing you know looks very casual to me no sense of urgency yet its early in the game and the day and thats pretty from Isaiah Wong twothirds of the way through his freshman year when he just kind of started doing that at will I think hes so impressive on what hes done in the off season hes in incredible physical condition hes added to his combo skills look out oh mirror unable to finish there is a time not that long ago where North Shadow Mirror barely knew how to dribble not taking it Coast to Coast himself for the tricky lefthanded finish Joseph the other way Wong is open got it the long triple is a long rebound that leads to the transition Isaiah Wong doing a nice job I agree with you Debbie theres a casualness about the way Miami has approached this first four and a half minutes and yet theyre up 97 well I I think there are teams that have what you call the switch that they can turn it on when they need to Cohen going to work on omir and thats what he can do thats the skill set right there high off the glass over that left shoulder I mean hes really fun to watch work hes got excellent footwork good hands moves without the ball hes a very good screener that helps him get postop position deep three From Poplar wont go rebound for land Applause in Saint Francis be happy with this pace right here I think they would they could play Cohen a lot of minutes at this pace tough turnaround wont go Miller pulls down the miss Applause Wong in the lane nicely done so smooth I dont think hes broken a sweat yet got a quick seven points three to four shooting easy this could be a big game for him this could be a big number for Isaiah Wong today I scored more points than a game than anyone in the ACC this year he had 36 week and a half ago against Cornell hurricanes had trouble putting the big red away see if they have the similar difficulty with a red flash today omir straight away will not goes now one for seven from Beyond The Arc this season that is where he likes to shoot the three in the trail in the middle third thats his best opportunity thats probably where coach L would give him the green light Im not so sure on the wing or on the Baseline Applause pretty good ball movement from the red flash sets up Landon Moore for three all of Miamis defense was loaded to the strong side thats why you got to have quick ball reversal gets Landon Moore in rhythm youre the 38 team from the Northeast conference coming into the U pretty pleased with the flow of the start of this game but the answer from Bensley Joseph you asked how he was feeling thats a confident shooter right there that is confidence to come down and pull that one 39 from threes so far in his Miami career Joseph making his first career start today Gregory to the corner long stretch of uninterrupted ball Cohen makes a move draws the foul itll be on omir his first free throws for Cohen after we get ourselves a timeout Isaiah won smooth stroke from the outside hes got a quick seven and there was one foul call thatll lead us into free throws here out of the break lets get our Ford keys to the game presented by your local Ford dealer what you got today Deb well for Saint franciss third transition game and part of that has to do with shot selection and not sending anybody to the glass they got to get back build a wall and make Miami score over them and for Miami its Cohen you know mixing up your coverages on him and playing them oneonone right now but lets see if theyll need to make an adjustment part of that is good ball pressure on the perimeter to keep him from getting a quality catch on the Block oh what is the the coachs scouting report on Cohen this is not some random Scout its the coach that says hes not that athletic hes not explosive hes not here because of his physical tools but its a big butt he can play inside and out hes a phenomenal passer with great feel and hes got a good touch around the hoop well its typical of a guy that had a late growth spurt right six feet tall playing on the perimeter learning how to play underneath and controlling the ground and then you go to 610 and you have this incredible skill set for 10 inches from his freshman year of high school to his senior year of high school Saint Francis switches to a Zone Wong straightaway three rebound for AJ Casey freshman from Chicago getting some early minutes today Harlan Beverly coming off a really solid performance in 16 minutes against the wolf pack again no Nigel pack today for Miami and a travel called as Miami turns it over for the second time Miami has a team averages making seven threes and one of the things that Rob kriml told us is he needed to keep the ball out of the paint thats why I switch off the time out to the zone said Rob krimmels as Saint Francis lifer he attended Saint Francis graduated in 2000 immediately became an assistant for his college head coach and now hes in his 11th year as the leader of the program good hands and it rolls underneath hes one of 52 coaches in the country in division one whos coaching his alma mater there are four in the northeastern conference theyre also four in the ACC ORS Jim larenega beat his alma mater earlier this season for his 700th career win a nice milestone for larenaga Music shot clock winding down Cohen just has a knack for putting the ball in the hoop when you talk quality of catch with him thats what Im talking about catching it on the Block not in the high post area up in the high post hes more of a facilitator hes probably gonna pass into or dribble into a handoff or dribble into a pass into a screen but on the Block hes going to look to score Music Applause Jordan Miller still looking for his first points Saint Francis from Loretto Pennsylvania on the drive nicely finished by Landon Moore whos got a quit nine points in the first nine minutes thats a smart Play Because Cohen Sprints to his postup position and Moore does a nice job of filling behind that cut thats why he got a lane to the bucket Applause Corner three short Casey comes up empty just his fifth threepoint attempt of the Season limited minutes you know theres some opportunity today whether its Bensley Joseph playing significantly more minutes or one of these other young players for Jim larenega getting an opportunity with Nigel pack being out well coach L talk to us about his rotation he likes to get to seven maybe to eight maybe nine or ten by the time you get to conference play so you keep trying to add pieces heat check for more Beverly Coast to Coast around and out I think Beverly is the player that I thought had gained extra minutes in that NC State game because in the second half when they changed their ball screen coverage I thought Beverly did a great job of Defending NC States backcourt beautiful pass Cohen caught it in the right spot again really nice spacing good entry away from the D ude Cohen catches it that deep its two points its an eightnothing Run for the red flag and theyve stayed in the zone now this is the third or fourth possession and it has worked its helped them separate a little bit from Miami early on theres the first bucket for Jordan Miller the transfer from George Mason coming off a 25point game look how patient he is thats his first shot right he has not looked to force anything Saint Francis is definitely playing with a good bit of intensity right now type of intensity you need on the road against an ACC opponent rennell Giles making his return to the lineup comes up Mt Beverly the other way finds Poplar at The Rim you got to communicate you gotta stop the ball and youve got to get a Defender that seeks the deepest offensive player miscommunication by Saint Francis Acosta Malaya first two for Poplar now all five Miami starters have scored Applause three ball short Wong with another rebound for Miami as Isaiah Wong had a tripledouble yet because hes due for one this year youre right the way he rebounds and the way he distributes on the top of the floor for Miami a couple years ago he had a 376 with no turnovers but uh his careerhigh eight assists came in his last game last Saturday Corner three money Poplar buries it assists long get on Q I think he sees the floor so well I think its an underrated skill about him we know how explosive and athletic he is we know he can score all three levels I think hes a tremendous teammate lets start that triple double watch early hes got seven two and two but an answer from the other Corner Marlon Hargis back after missing the last two games for Rob krimls team thank you play the red flash looked like they belong on this court right now Beverly cant connect red flash shooting 45 percent from the field and free throws are coming as Landon Moore continues to get where he wants to go for this visiting Saint Francis team well Miami Trails by two here in the first half its their inside outside game thats working against the Zone up the floor in transition Wong delivers to Poplar in the corner Miami down to hurricanes in the top 25 but trailing me visiting Saint Francis red flash by two in a nicely paced Opening 12 minutes time for The Fresh Market discover the best Miami one of the best offenses by any measure in the ACC so far well defense first for Coach L right and then its sharing the basketball which is another poor important part of his Ten Commandments if you will I think this is a well put together Miami team and they deserve this ranking that theyve gotten in 24 at 25 and they have good speed on the perimeter theyve got shot making ability when the shot clock gets inside 10 Wong can make a play for himself or someone else so he can bail you out at the end of possessions and hes a closer at the end of the game he can make free throws of course when we were at media day in October with coachell talking about North Chad he was uh very excited about him and he has delivered on every aspect of what coach L hoped he would bring to Miami in terms of his ability to scheme on the defensive end with him regarding one through five and also his offensive rebounding ability well when you ask coachell about North Chad omear he never starts with his basketball skill he starts with his Spirit his energy his passion for life his Joy the athleticism lives up to the building too joyfully throwing that one down perfect timing good job Evan way to set that up the six seven 248 pound bundle of positive energy and the answer from Brad McCabe Saint Francis has four first half threes and a fourpoint lead the cave has the best threepoint percentage for this team he hasnt made the most but hes made a couple today long it ended pretty well by Gregory but Anthony Walker has hit a lot of shots from that range throughout his career see thats Isaiah one coming off the timeout understanding if theyre going to stay in that zone weve got to beat it from the inside out its twice coming off the last time out that theyve scored in the paint thats for us four assists now for Isaiah Wong cam Gregory rattles one in and out Joseph tracks the miss Wong wide open saw that was off the moment it left his hand Grinnell Giles Jr pretty good defense by omir but Junior stays with it renell Giles in the book for the first points of the day really good second effort and what a locked in bench over there by coach cremell and coach criminal excuse me omir didnt want to pick up his second foul there well they they have stayed in the zone a little bit longer than I thought but as long as its a one or two possession game why would you go and change great defense there by Cohen intercepting the entry pass what do you thought about Miamis defense at this end of the floor well you see how many guys are in the stands right now Isaiahs in the stance on the weak side I dont think theyve had a sense of urgency yet I think Saint Francis is getting what they want a cave that was way off yeah not that time we got 517 left in the first half and well get ourselves a timeout nor Chad omear a big bundle of positive joy for the Miami Hurricanes this games been pretty smooth waters for him right now Rob criminal is a pretty good shooter back in his day about 40 percent shooter for his career from Beyond The Arc heres our Toyota on the floor presented by your local Toyota dealers or Chad omear Four Points three rebounds in nine minutes so far for Miami Isaiah Wong leading the way seven points for assists Hensley Joseph and the day he made his first career start Corner look and a rebound tipped and the first foul of the game called on Saint Francis they went the first 15 minutes of the game without a turnover or a foul I cant remember a team doing that ever before in a game that weve covered uh its a clean game no turnovers no free throws no fouls the clock is running and Im going to tell you this about Miami I keep looking for maybe a change in D or changing the rhythm of the way theyre playing uh I think coach L likes to save some stuff for the second half Joseph feeds the big man omir no tip no Cohens got the rebound for Saint Francis found the rebound action was on Whistler San in his first of course it was his first it was the teams first four and a half minutes to play in the first half each team will have plenty of fouls to give as we get down the stretch here comes that change double team up the ball screen forcing the time out that was the change that coach L made in the second half against NC State that gave NC States guard some trouble and as good as turquavion Smith and sharkell Joyner are Miamis fresher and quickness on the perimeter really did fluster the wolf pack well Jim larenega throughout his nearly four decadelong coaching career has valued his 10 commitments and at every single Miami practice you look on the floor in Miami sees the ten commitments and they can say him too Music much I was in practice yesterday with you Evan and we heard them go through those Ten Commandments and every player cites those before practice begins thats the first thing they do theres a visual representative of what they want and then its a vocal representative of what they expect not the first time Ive asked an analyst the question but in your mind Debbie whats the most important commitment of those ten well I like playing D and sharing the ball so I might have moved number seven up a little bit but uh I really dont even want defense to be the first commandment Id really like it to be threes and layups so I would switch that whole order around if I were coach L I know you dont thats why I dont have 700 wins either well but you dont miss free throws so free throws and that that level of precision would uh be on there what a career Jim larenega has had 706 wins entering the day I mean I always enjoy our time with him I think he is hes bright and Brilliant the way he sees the game and thinks the game and the way he communicates it with his players in practice its very clear Not Just the Ten Commandments but that is a derivative of everything that they do in the way they run their program hes refreshingly honest too you asked about Virginia not a lot of coaches would have answered the question he talked a lot about Virginia he said we spent all offseason preparing for Virginia thats what his answer was big block by Isaiah Wong right there you know what he its the game is not complicated its very simple there are certain Concepts you have to guard theres certain Concepts you have to play in if you can do those consistently and then youre aware of the Tendencies of your opponents and you can build on those in the off season thats why we have an off season and thats why we have all these extended Crazy Summer hours and spring out restrictions in the NCAA dont even get me going on all these rules that we have about when you can and cannot be with your players the fourth and fifth blocks of the game before Miami came on that last possession getting a shot clock violation and Jordan Miller inside with his second field goal so now coach criminal knows theyre going to bring two to a ball screen Action Now do you just go five out motion and you dont run ball screen action because youve been scoring without having to play out of that double team is that what you would do thats what I would do yes but this right here because this is a tough unless youre prepared for it and they say theres just turn to us two mistakes on the double teams on the money in Poplar across the contact in transition and will shoot Miamis first free throws of the day the key to the clean game was not turning it over and letting Miami tilt the floor you know going downhill on a downhill Drive you got a freshman backcourt too in Saint Francis you got a lot of young guys out there Rob krimmel throughout his coaching career has often played multiple point guards at the same time so this is the Miami team that without Nigel pack is a little shorthanded in that department my favorite moment of practice yesterday was when assistant coach DJ Irving was kind of lighting up the canes on the scout team and Jim larenega said its good thing for you all that DJ isnt playing tomorrow DJ was not the best player in practice but he was one of the top five yesterday he was played his college ball at Boston University still play going down the coaching path another steal for omir nor Chad oh mirror Applause rocking the rim for Miami time out Saint Francis Applause six seven and put together looks like a tight end or a middle linebacker sure does look at him motoring down the floor he even brushed off a little contact right there you could have called a foul Thats How Strong he is in finishing its a great steal to get it started what a journey this kid has had it was a baseball player in Nicaragua just spotted by a basketball coach one day said hey you want to play basketball youre tall a couple days later after it asks his parents for permission he went and played basketball he said he couldnt do anything other than rebound and pass the ball back to his teammates but he has rounded out his game its a walking DoubleDouble this has got to be a lot more fun than trying to hit a curveball Id say so the first ever scholarship college basketball player from the country of Nicaragua and Central America and Miamis definitely picked up their defense here in the last portion of this first half clock winding down Cohen not where he wants to catch it able to catch iron in the rebound for McCabe hits Cohen on the dive but unable to finish omear for Poplar and he just lost it on the dribble out of bounds thats a three on two thats when you got numbers and the momentums starting to swing your way if youre Miami and its all based on commandment number one defense Music theres also a commitment that theyll take care of the ball which a rare mistake from the Keynes their fourth turnover theyre averaging 12 turnovers per game they showed you in the graphic earlier Miamis third in the league and scoring second the league and field goal percentage Joseph fouls the Deep shooter three free throws are coming up here for Landon Moore foreign Bensley Joseph and Landon Moore had a great start to the season slowed down a little bit lately only seven points his last six games after about 15 points per game in his first five hes got 10 in the first half as we pause for this message from Works Nitro meet Works Nitro powerful tools for any project with gaslike power without the gas fueled by Power share batteries to give you the power to outperform foreign Moore has one more and a chance to regive Saint Francis the lead Applause hes one of those freshmen in the backcourt that we were talking about for Rob krimmel what a good first half for the young guy and now Saint Francis back in the zone not sure we would have would have expected five ties nine lead changes in the first half but thats where we are so we watched Saint Francis workout last night we knew they were prepared for the game second bucket for Anthony Walker youre right they practiced hard but it was hard to see them matching up with Miamis athleticism and skill s theyve taken care of the ball theyve played steady theyve relied on this big man who can score against multiple Defenders inside that is all Landon Moore stepping through that trap knowing the traps coming one stretch dribble and a good piece of footwork three assists for Landon Moore to go along with his 13 points so now you get some confidence now you want to bring two to the ball because you know somebodys going to be open a lot of traffic in the lane but pushed up and in by a walker Music Ive always liked Anthony Walker hes a hustle guy and makes plays when hes playing hard 10th lead change of the half and Walker playing a little too hard there lacking discipline bumping into the perimeter ball handler watch Landon Moore he knows the doubles coming he takes one Escape dribble and then he steps through with contact youve got to make yourself as a receiver and thats what Josh Cohen does and then Walker coming into the game had 10 field goals on the season five in the last three games so he is starting to come on to your point Evan awkward fall there for will the Poplar but he did pop back up final minute of the half Moore hangs in the air scores plus the foul the half of Landon Moores college basketball life the bad news is Josh Cohen is slow to get up Music he looks at the coachs staff with the thumbs up hes trying to walk it off well things would change dramatically for say Francis Josh Cohen the most improved player in the Northeast conference last year he went from 57 points per game as a freshman the 129 points per game as a sophomore except for 21 points per game this year and Landon Moore making a case for NEC freshman of the year hes got 16 in the half now just keep in mind what we talked about at the beginning you know the NEC plays a lot of money games so no one in their league but one team has a 500 record this is a good basketball team their record is misleading because of the travel and the schedule theyve played wrong doesnt get the bounce a heck of an effort by Wooga Poplar on the board hell take the shot and Cohen ankle feeling okay with that rebound shot clock is off red flash up by two of the ball hell get in the locker room and hell lace that shoe up a little bit tighter after they retape that ankle Music Owens sets his screen more with six working on Walker long to steal looks at the clock long all by himself beats the buzzer to tie the game foreign what a steal and what a way to finish the first half Evan what and uh Josh Cohen confident believe as he retakes the floor for the second half red flash basketball Music swell land going to work rebound over here hes a twohanded rebounder and youre not taking it from him Miller Baseline too good job by coachell first play in the second half trying to get Jordan Miller going I mean he does not have a very aggressive first half if you will I dont think he really looked for his offense he was very patient maybe theyll get him going here in a second hes two for four in the first 20 now three for five on the day six points land the Junior from Cincinnati back to Moore leading scorer in the game so far misses the three Joseph Poplar to the basket and hell shoot free throws for Miami cleanhouse McCabe and held his ground he might have been able to draw a charge because Poplar started that drive from so far away from the basket that you had time to rotate over well go popular guys made a big jump from his freshman year to his sophomore year Kim laronega wishes that he were more aggressive offensively in shooting midrange jumpers they do a threepoint shooting drill every day its the five minute drill so you have one minute for five spots on the floor the Baseline the wing top of the key Baseline and wing and you have to make a certain score to be able to get the green light and Poplar is one of the better shooters from Miami especially in the midrange full court pressure here yeah I like it I like the change right here I like that Miamis picking up the pace you cant let Saint Francis continue to play at their pace let oh mirror go one on one with Cohen and did a pretty good job there Joseph the other way Music all right Jim larenega a lot of wins in his career hes never beaten Saint Francis of Pennsylvania trying to do that for the first time today long teardrop gets his own rebound fakes it takes it makes it and one and thats on McCabe thats two quick fouls on the shooter for Saint Francis this is Isaiah 1 look at that stopping pull up stays with it good extra effort on the second try Applause all of a sudden Wongs got 12 in the game full court pressure continues and Saint Francis handles it again McCabe for three stick back up and in for land thats his first points of the game this is Miamis Pace right here we didnt see much of this in the first half quick shot long cant connect good walkout from the cave on Poplar two minutes into the second half Miami started this half 72 Cohen lost his footing spinning around and Wong sneaks away with a theft no look Poplar yes Applause you know I was anticipating coach L would save something for the second half and its the full court pressure that is the adjustment around the fiveminute Mark in the first half they went to double teaming small screen action theyre not doing that yet here in the second Music regularly the shot clock winding down and Cohen realizes clock cant connect whats the mindset for saving the adjustment until halftime as opposed to five minutes to go in the first half you save it you got to save something in your back pocket so you dont give him time at halftime to adjust sort of an element of surprise ballon Cohen Miami ball underneath Miami this is when the floor looks like its tilted meaning theyre running downhill and theyre running the floor hard to score thats how strong omir is that he holds his ground while Cohen tries to spin around him with his footwork long more contact more free throws so Miami shot two free throws the entire first half theyre already making a second trip to the free throw line I I really like the way youre characterizing the court because it does feel tilted right now it feels like the red flash youre going uphill well now theyre not as comfortable in running their stuff right Miamis getting up in them theyre taking time off the shot clock theyre not just walking the ball up the floor now you got to play 9450 and thats where Miami can use their speed and their athleticism to impose their will on the game The 132 Run heading back to the end of the first half largest lead of the game for Miami was dribbling up a Minefield there but somehow he maintained possession with Defenders reaching in this is an important trip here for the red Flash more to the bucket colon and the stick back gets it to go in the foul a couple of offensive rebounds have been the scoring here in the second half for Saint Francis this is a great take Little Euro hesitation good D without fouling by Wong great crash to the weak side see Cohen goes from strong side to weak side to be able to rebound that on the other side of the basket see how long got the ball there but Cohen was able to repossess and get it up off the glass Rob krimmel told us a great story about recruiting Josh Cohen as he misses the free throw is some play an AAU Game and his athleticism doesnt stand out he wasnt particularly in great shape but his assistant coach Andrew Helton said coach his shot goes in its a simple way to think about it but his shot goes in hes really skilled this is where you want to trap in the corner you got two guys over there you had numbers down omir sees it makes it I think the defense has got to live with that jump shot I agree with you but its a dagger when it goes in Keynes by nine 415 gone here in the second half land on the drive good burst to quickness but unable to finish Joseph ahead for omir deflected out of bounds no last touched by omir itll be Saint Francis ball and the red flash will have it after we get ourselves a timeout Music 134 start to the second half for Miami Music chain is more of a football thing than a basketball thing but that would be one heck of a turnover Champion I dont know if you can employ that on the basketball court by him hes got a nine point lead and Isaiah Wongs are Hardys star to watch at the top of the show we have a legitimate triple double watch with 15 33 to go hes five rebounds and five assists away from his first career tripledouble I think hes so entertaining I mean this is a ticket selling player like all around the ACC you want to go and watch Isaiah Wong play because he has great demeanor he has maturity he has a high IQ about the way he sees the game and how he distributes the basketball and he doesnt make a lot of mistakes the average 29 Points last week including the 36point explosion against Cornell wild 107 105 victory over the big red ten days after taking down the big red theyre trying to do the same with a red flash but Josh Cohen has other ideas hes now got 14 see omir omir thought there was going to be a trap on that ball screen and thats why you got to communicate on defense a PA just have one win over an ACC opponent they beat Pittsburgh a few years ago Poplar for the second chance omir for the Third lets tie up Im scared all of a sudden being in a tie up Music hes got a tough exterior and Coach L talks about his character off the floor Ill tell you what he is a mean rebounder he averages four offensive rebounds a game got multiple blocks today for the fifth time this season long step back everythings been there for Isaiah today except the threepoint shot hes now one for seven from Deep ER should be called for a foul Jamel Spearman was right there makes the call its number two on OMeara great years for Mike milado at Arkansas State for a season at Miami prep for norchad Im excited just for the next couple of months you know theres folks around the ACC that maybe havent watched Miami yet and you know every week a new fan base is going to be exposed to North Chad OMeara and with how much joy he plays with its fun to see Millers trying to put his shoe back on at the other end of the floor and a crazy sequence leads to a lid and more triple when you go high risk and you dont get the reward defensively you got to make them pay on the other end thats how you get an emotional swing in a game and Ill tell you what I am impressed by Landon Moore sure thing just a freshman he has not played like a freshman today got a career high 19 points look at Poplar responds for the U those are the shots that coach laronega wants him taking at any time in the shot clock double figures for Poplar today for just the third time all season Miami gets a stop Harlan Beverly Before the defense can set Pierce is the paint gets to the freethrow line drawn the blocking foul on Hargis so the element of surprise right they didnt trap it the first time they do the second they get a steal Miami but then you strike back quickly and thats how you swing the emotion of the game Landon Moore what a great game he is playing on the road and then Poplar anytime in the shot clock first Miss from the freethrow line for Miami today Harlan Beverly Beverly basically missed all last year with a back injury good to see him back out there for the hurricane eightpoint game 13 and a half to play first game of three today here on your Regional Sports Networks Louisville Cardinals looking to put a little winning streak together in the Kenny Payne era for the first time its two oclock against Florida a m ale Cohen working inside working hard to get to the line that is a wellearned trip to the free throw line I mean the strength to handle the double its a hard trap in the short corner and he runs off a stagger on the other side to get that position below thats 610 working off all that screening action you can make all the jokes about how hes not athletic with a ball and hes got good hands Applause the teams are the best players dont always win sometimes its the best team 15 and five for Cohen only player in the country with multiple 30point games this year hes a ticket selling player like I cant wait to watch what they do in conference play like doing the NEC is going to be able to guard him great point the tallest guy on the floor today against an ACC opponent theres Isaiah Wong Kylie long distance you and the ACC is going to guard him three speakmen perhaps on Tuesday night yeah thats a good one on Tuesday Virginia is getting a much you know tougher challenge against Houston defensively than what Miamis getting today not that Miami isnt being challenged they certainly are big block AJ Casey this is fourth block of the season for the freshman oh inside Poplar beautiful pass from Isaiah Wong his seventh assist if he has a triple double and we called it in the first half Evan were going to celebrate you and me yeah I think we inspired him if it happens poplars got a career high by the way Lugers got 16 and an awkward fall there rennell Giles Jr has been banged up hope he pops back up here Music Applause Isaiah Wong just playing space great vision to the rim AJ Casey starts the break and then look at that feed if you run the floor you will be rewarded now we see uh long throw up the goggles on that one Isaiahs had a tremendous career but hes in his best stretch ever in terms of passing the ball he hasnt had a threegame stretch like this 21 assists in counting in his last two games plus today long again maybe create for himself this time two yeah corns we havent seen that set and he splits it through the top because he is low to the ground he knows how to play the hips and shoulders Game Heaven where his hips and shoulders lower than the player thats defending him quick 70 run stretching the Miami lead and they got Poplar for the foul he doesnt like it but Saint Francis will shoot a pair when we come back Isaiah Wongs got 19 points five rebounds and seven assists Miami by 13 Music all right foreign Applause its time now for the Continental Tire recap Miami shooting 62 here in the second half it was high 37 all at the break the hurricanes have seized control since halftime well theyve started to separate because theyve been more aggressive simply with their defense their full court pressure their ball screen coverage and getting to the free throw line they only went to the free throw line one trip in the first half theyve already been multiple times here in the second into action with the Saint Francis trip to the line for Landon Moores having a career day just his 12th Career College basketball game but promising freshman from Bloomington Illinois he made 114 threes during his senior year of high school Debbie it was a school record at Western Reserve Academy and hes two for two at the line hes got 21 today here at Miami well he has not looked like a freshman we remarked about that in the first half long steps into the three rebound for land Saint Francis can string a couple solid possessions together get this back to a manageable single digit game Cohen the catch blocked from behind by Joseph thats a timing play offensively coming off the timeout its a good ATO but a better defensive read by Joseph on the back side as soon as McCabe catches it he throws it to that back corner of the backboard off Cohen shoulder out of bounds says rainy stions on the Baseline eighth block of the game for Miami Omer going to work on the Block too easy 10 points five rebounds for norchad Music Applause Corner three McCabe got it thats his third three of the day he picked up those two quick fouls in the second hes played pretty well without picking up another nine points from McCabe Wong all for the travel he thought he held that back pivot foot you know Isaiah with a whistle disagreed yeah excuse me we were talking about him earlier Evan right about how he does not turn the ball over hes had three turnovers but two have been traveling so its not as necessarily his decision making its just his burst of speed in the paint in his footwork eight assists no turnovers last Saturday against NC State Miami coming from behind thats a tough contested too early in the shot clock and leads to a run out one on three he scores anyway thats how quickly the game can swing hurricane six of their last seven from the four round and out Poplar gets a piece of the rebound but McCabe controls it long contest Cohen stays with it and hell shoot free throws Music into the fourth quarter of this basketball game Debbie Jim larenango looking for win number 707 in his illustrious career lets go away with those now 17 points in the game but no assist so he has done a really good job of playing oneonone making his free throws when he gets to the line offensive rebounding that last sequence they called the foul on Joseph his third asked Jim larenega yesterday if you win the game on Saturday do you enjoy Saturday evening before you start focusing on Virginia Sunday said Evan as soon as the game is over Ill get something to eat if we lose Ill go eat at home if we win Ill go out to eat and as soon as the game ends Im thinking about the next game tipped out to Joseph and thats three Ensley Joseph making his first career start he two for three from downtown and then the conversation led to film watching and how he doesnt think smart TV is very smart because he cant rewind where he wants to rewind games too and Im like coach dont you just have you know like everything downloaded on your computer thats the problem I dont want to watch it on my computer got the eight foot TV you want to use that remember those old VHS tapes we used to travel around with I was telling coach and I were sharing a story about watching tape and on the road and I was saying how I used to try to beg the hotel front office to let me borrow the VHS equipment that was in the conference room and not make me pay for it I didnt want the AV cart rolling in my room usually I could talk him into it I wonder if Josh Cohen and Isaiah Wong know what youre talking about when you refer to a VHS well see have to ask them next time we we see him Applause coachell knew exactly what I was talking about Applause I put that on my bucket list to watch some film with him I think thatd be an incredible experience I would really like to inventable I really like to do that I dont I dont have like a Christmas list of Evan I have a basketball bucket list Music going at the line makes it a 12 point game what else is on the list oh theres a lot of things that involve basketball people in places wheres one place youve never called a game that youd really like to get to Joseph for three not this time long rebound though Allen field house in Kansas oh what a play Walker unable to finish after fake and Cohen out of his shoes theres a steal Poplar intercepts to pass up the floor a lot of folks have talked about Lawrence Kansas as a bucketless destination Ive called a womens game there before Id like to call the Mens game there time out taken by Jim larenega we will take it take an egg and Company trying to get to 111 in the season Music foreign put a bow on it this holiday coming up at 2 pm on most of these same stations Louisville Cardinals looking to keep it rolling L Ellis coming off the 30point 10 assists game on Wednesday picking on Florida a m as we return to action here at Miami and George Miller gets his fourth field goal of the day hes got eight points quiet eight points today for Jordan and look were under eight minutes its a 14 point game certainly not Out Of Reach by any stretch Miami has been a better team in the second half after we were tied through 20 long shot wont go rebound tipped and controlled by Joseph look at Wong Sprint that lane numbers long fouled I mean he put it in another gear because hes sensing two points on the other end Music another timeout Miami by 14 with Virginia coming to town on Tuesday night Music its time for the fast break presented by your local Ford dealer a week before Christmas no ACC conference games today but Debbie a look at the Conference standings as they Shape Up Now Miami will try to get to 30 against Virginia here on Tuesday what a great matchup that is with two ranked teams in the ACC Miami just getting into the polls but the team I really like to keep an eye on is Virginia Tech Sean Padula their point guard is one of the most improved players in the ACC as a sophomore he has been in double figures in every game for Mike Youngs team and we will see Mr Padula later today the third game of our triple header will be in Blacksburg but first well send you to Louisville the Cardinals looking for a winning streak after their victory over Western Kentucky on Wednesday theyll take on the Rattlers of Florida a m with Tom wormy and Brian Oliver and then Dean linke and Mike jaminsky will be at Castle Coliseum its a sneaky good Grambling team that has wins over Colorado and Vanderbilt this is a good transition offensive team in Grambling so Virginia Techs gonna have to give back and build a wall the best way to do that is their ability to score theyve got balanced offensive scoring and really fun to watch all right for Hokies try to get to 111 later this afternoon pack after this from your local Ford dealer in America the future belongs to everyone so we built the new Ford Bronco sports for everyone with seven available goat modes and a camera with offroad views its built for America Music every week see how you can take your fishing skills to the next level as we travel our gorgeous area lakes and waterways enjoying some Great Outdoor Adventure watch lets fish with Barry Stokes Thursdays and Sundays on Valley Sports Southeast Miami up 14 with 7 35 to go Hurricanes playing without Nigel pack today started every game this year hes for double figures 49 times in his 54 career games between KState and Miami hes under the weather hopefully the canes will have him back on Tuesday for Virginia the one thing about Nigel pack that that I recognize coming into this game was his his scoring had dropped a little but his assist numbers have gone up and hes not a natural point guard and that means hes getting better because he can score so if if his assist numbers and hes seeing the second level and third level better on the top of the floor for Jim larenega thats a good thing for Miami single digits in the last four games from the scoring standpoint but becoming more of a playmaker so good clear out another good set the same set ATO off the timeout except for on the other side of the floor weve seen some good old school entry passes today good job our Rock privilege team executing score you get a stop youre trying to get this thing to three possessions going into the last four minutes you gotta contain more Chad omear and thats easier said than done Music throws it to the top of the backboard I have a corner where a mirror can get it unable to complete the threepoint play its a 15point game is a 70 freethrow shooter but his frequency of going to the line is going to go up so he hes going to have to shoot it a little bit better take advantage of those free points mentioned the old school entry passes Bob criminals an old school guy staying with one program forever he also is very adamant that he does not like the transfer portal hes not going to recruit transfers he wants to recruit freshmen and develop them like Landon Moore what a play right there by Moore what a game this young freshman is having yeah criminal is uh hes a Pennsylvania guy right Eileen or Aileen excuse me his wife Alex and Tommy his sons are watching Im sure and Joseph for three knocks it in Bensley into double figures with 11 one point shy of his career high Robs dad was an alltime great swimming coach at Penn State Rod grew up a Penn State fan attended more adding to the highlight reel ing it like a young Antonelli out there a young Patrick thats right your sons got a big game this afternoon yeah Ill be watching that next four oclock Emery and Henry how are the Wasps doing theyre doing great theyre playing in the southern Athletic Conference in uh their second year but theyre eligible this year for the conference tournament they just moved up to D2 thanks for asking thats cool thats the fourth foul on your Chad omear yeah 17 foul so one and one coming up here for Josh Cohen Applause here back to the bench Josh Cohens the only player in college basketball to score 40 in a game without making a three all season and he did it twice and hes done it twice Applause at 40 points nine rebounds against Lehigh in November and had 40 points nine rebounds against Hawaii 16 of 23 from the field six days ago Joseph nice pass Applause Miller into double figures as well but an answer from Max land and as Saint Francis team just wont quite go completely away now you gotta love the competitive fight right theyve stuck to their game plan Miami has just made plays there just might be superior talent wise but it doesnt mean that that takes away from your game planning eight points now for Walker he gets one more hoop then Miami will have six different guys and double figures today under five to play Giles to Cohen what a nice delivery 23 now for Josh Cohen passed by his season average of 21 Music and we were thinking can Cohen do what he does against his Miami team the answer has been yes theyve gotten him the ball in good spots its the quality of the catch its down low in the paint oh rainbow three from Bensley Joseph and hes had a career day for the hurricanes Bensley Joseph this is just his third game of the season in double figures Music points five of seven shooting make it 25 for Cohen now below the rim 610 skilled finisher inside we did see him dunk there are a lot of people that like to have that piece yesterday in practice I was wondering if he could dunk and we saw him dunk so you know coaches like to make the joke he cant jump over that sheet of paper he can in fact jump over a stack of paper 14point games we head down the stretch Bensley Joseph in his first start of his career at Miami just take what the defense to give you backtoback triples to help Miami extend Pi security the hurricanes have done a great job putting up a wall around the rim nine blocks in the game they have five different players that have blocked the shot three for long and three for OMeara and most of those are rotating over to helps good help side defense Isaiah had seven blocks and 11 games coming into today but hes got a careerhigh three on this Saturday afternoon Miami trying to put this pesky red flash team away Anthony Walker with his free throw would be the sixth hurricane in double figures on a day that they did not have Nigel pack who averages 11 a game there it is Music season High 10 for Walker doubling his previous season high at five at Louisville and a guy that cant contribute when the moment is right 16point game this matches the largest Miami lead come on working on omeares got four fouls and Wong fouled Cohen whos got a chance for a threepoint play I mean he is just so good at countering double moves can put it on the floor so I got a question for you no assists no assist hes not hes not in there to pass Evan how would you compare a guy like Jaden Gardner at Virginia to Josh Cohen well bigger longer Cohen is more physical yes not not as physical no Left Right scoring footwork gets to the free throw line yeah be an interesting matchup Tuesday omir and Gardner three minutes to go 13point game Music on the drive heck of a take Poplar extends his career high with 18 the other thing too about Cohen is he doesnt get in foul trouble right he try to attack him he tried to go at him but and they do a really good job they bring him up high they bring them away from pressure then they dive him back Wong looking up high the tip wouldnt go omir being tugged down and uh omirs like I got found four times there but all by the same guy and hell get free throws Music all right to be the best basketball player in your country is a pretty cool thing and nor Chad omear was named the best basketball player in the nation of Nicaragua this week by the Olympic Committee from the Nicaraguan from the country it was a pretty close parents attended the ceremony because he couldnt be there its really cool yeah gotta think hes the first D1 scholarship player right certainly not the last hes you know the Pioneer in that regard well basketball Without Borders is a big program in the NBA yeah its got a great future in this game reading some quotes that his Old Coach Mike milado said about him in Arkansas State mulatto is an assistant under Rick Pitino at Louisville coach Donovan Mitchell coach Russ Smith he puts out mirror kind of in that category hes the best players hes ever coached well thats an incredible work ethic if youre in category with those two not just because they produce but how they work elato also mentioned Terry Rozier in that conversation Applause minions see the Louisville Cardinals the Yum Center in about 15 minutes have a day welcome Poplar first 20point game of his Miami career hes just getting started that 15footer right there he works to get to the other elbow its exactly the shots that coachell talked to us about yesterday that he wants Poplar looking to take uses that lap that last bounce to help him Elevate into his jump shot Music Miami is getting better yeah that Virginia game on Tuesday is going to be awesome one more nonconference game after today for Miami theyve got Vermont three days after Christmas and then uh tall conference games after that quick turnaround they host for Iman on the 28th and then they go to South Bend to face the always pesky uh Fighting Irish Mike Brae December 30th Applause Buck 45 to play hustle away from the ball favor Ira into the game for the first time and the Freshman from Nigeria gets called for a foul theres the upcoming schedule we were alluding to Virginia its possible if they beat Houston today they could rise up to number one they got a bunch of first place votes this past week lets just say Miami stays at 25 great media relations director for Miami basketball reminded me before the game that 10 years ago when Miami won the ACC ENT December 25th in the nation Duke was number one Blue Devils came here and Miami blew him out I think it was 9063 and then Miami grows in the polls went on to win the regular season title and the tournament title not predicting anything Im just if its 25 and Virginia becomes number one theres some spinning it youre putting a forward spin on it Evan I got what youre doing Im Im looking at Mike Brays team at Notre Dame they are dangerous especially at home they shoot it so well weve got five veteran dies six graduate students on that roster they run an offense and they can shoot it really shoot it JJ starling refreshment is really special well Isaiah Wong Debbie has reached 10 assists for the first time in his career hes likely to fall short of the triple double its the first time that any hurricane has had doubledigit assists in a game since Bruce Brown had a triple double November of 2017 against Gardner Webb Christian walks in into the game comes up shoot battle for the board won by Brad McCabe and its going to be interesting to see the Saint Francis team how they fare as they head into conference play they got a trip to Robert Morris and then its conference games going forward for them well I think coach criminal and his staff have got to be pleased with really really good portions of this game when they look at film and they use it as a teaching tool oh good defense there Ira the block Beverly steps into the three Ira the rebound and hell get to the line the iray was the last guy to leave the gym yesterday after practice put in a lot of extra work in his oneonone post moves and even stepped out to the three Im glad that should be a really good piece it says something about the first guy at the gym and the last guy in the gym interesting thing from the Saint Francis perspective real quick theyre in a league its obviously a onebedroom most likely the last three teams that have won the northeastern Conference tournament title are not in the conference anymore so you ask coach kriml whos the favorite in your league hes like its a tossup yup you know we feel like we got a good chance but everyone feels like they got a good chance its a challenging schedule that he put in front of his team as an effort to build habits good habits offensive and defensive habits and I think theyve done that through this schedule so dont be sleeping on their record country well yeah she put it that way sure its all about how you spit it five to shoot here Gregory nice dish and two more at The Rim Justin liberis with his first two and that should do it Saint Francis was tied at the half but Miami was the better team scoring 54 points making 56 points in the second 20 and then it doesnt like that Slam at the Finish old school doesnt appreciate what Zion did the other night in the NBA and nothing like that either but uh a 9176 win for Miami as they improved to 111 heading into their Tuesday night Showdown with Virginia well be back after this
