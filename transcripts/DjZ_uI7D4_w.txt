and welcome inside Connie Forum with Malcolm hakabe Im John me Perell Boston College and Virginia Cavaliers 116 in the ACC BC is 6 and 10 important game Malcolm for especially Virginia yeah on the road as were getting closer to closer to March a huge game on the road for Virginia Quinton post has the basketball eight point shy of a th000 in his bc career hes the headliner in the BC starting five post with the jump hook its off the line and the rebound to Jordan Miner Miner of Virginia a transfer for Mar m College down the road in North Andover Mass hes also from Kingston Mass south of Chestnut Hill hes part of that starting five for Tony Bennett but youre watching re beaten closely yeah hes got about 20 family members in attendance tonight as well to always good to get back home in front of some family Jake grow and and the rebound to post offense has been problematic for Virginia to say the least the last three games they have not cracked 40 points what do you make of those numbers well I think a couple of things getting off to a quick start thats obviously key for Virginia theyre still one of the better defensive teams in college basketball and deliberate as always Jordan Miner attempting the reverse and he got stifled by post madsons been red hot the three misses we had a broadcast against Miami when he h seven out of 123 since hes been in the lineup 17 points per game the last five outings crosscourt beatman to Dunn Dunn known for his defensive progress heres beatman with a three Madson guarded tightly by Dunn fadell Harris over the post both teams struggling offensively in the first two minutes yeah thats a pretty clean look though for Quinton post the sevenfooter for Boston College again hes a guy that can step out on the perimeter and knock down shots thats a clean look Isaac NE e their top three point shooter finds Patman coming off a 10point outing in their loss on Saturday in North Carolina by 10 but nearly the fade away in Virginia is off the schneide and thats the area that he continues to improve upon again he gets crowded so much on the perimeter because of his threepoint shooting ability thats a tough pullup jumper over MJ Harris nearly 42 from the field 45 from three he hit 64 of the averaging 12 points second on the team behind Beakmans 138 posted towards the rack and the left hand kiss off the glass yeah thats a tough a bucket by Quinton post again one of the better bigs in college can step out on the perimeter that time though showing off the handle and finish through contact Neely tries to get by Harris and our first foul of the game is on claudell Harris but Tony Bens concerned with BCs physicality and here it is magnified yeah right here though post again on the perimeter you have to honor his threepoint shooting ability and we talked about the importance of this game for Virginia right now they sit third uh in the ACC but theres still a log Jam and plenty of teams are trying to get up to the upper half of that ACC standings beatman just in front of the elbow got the soft roll re pakmans offensive game has improved year by year hasnt it yeah off a reigning Defensive Player of the Year in the ACC last season again one of the best defensive guards in college basketball but youre right credit Tony Bennett and staff hes continued to improve his offensive game Madson Hoist the three and beatman has the rebound beatman so consistent too he has 162 assists and 57 turnovers those numbers are magnificent as he climbs the Virginia time assist leaders oh theyve a year in and year out been one of the better assisted turnover ratio teams in college and that right there though is what Virginia does uh thats a beautiful pin down again off a nice uh ball movement and a McNeely clean look that cannot happen if youre Boston College Virginias been due its the old hey you know what theyre due to hit some three game as theyre five for 28 on threes and their last two plus games or three plus games and BC looks like theyre still trying to find their offensive MOJ beatman too strong Miner tries to go over the top he had a good game against North Carolina with 12 points claudell Harris from three no and the weak side rebound for dun well although Boston College has been shooting the ball better a 44 threes made in their last four games feel like theyve been settling early into shot clock and that plays right in the hands of what Virginia wants to do again theyre going to contest most shots I think if youre Boston College try to get something going to the basket beatman against mton and hes got another one hes beatman his confident he had 20 points against wake farest coming out that 10point seven or seven rebound and five assist game against the Tar Heels where Not much went right they were outscored 266 in the first half M glockton on the Baseline for Applause post and a bad pass by Quint post thats his 69th turnover of the year he leads the team but MC Neil is on the mark look they did a phenomenal job against uh one of the better scores in college basketball RJ Davis who did not have a great shooting night but they also struggled from the offensive end as well too so again uh defense certainly though has been their calling card saw what Davis did the other night tying a Dean Smith Center record finding Tyler hbor scoring Mark with 42 McNeely and a rebound to Donald hand hand the son of former Virginia star Donald H senior 19th on the Virginia scoring list sixth on the all time time School assist Ledger played there in the mid 90s post and hes been flx in the post that was good defense by Buchanan yeah but it seems like Boston College having issues just handling the ball again clean entry pass host just missed that layup and then on the other end uh theyve been unable to contain Reese beakman uh he has just had his way getting into the paint thats his six point early on in this game and getting some early Run for the Eagles due to the absence of Chaz Kelly backup point guard whos out with an injury and guarded by McNeil now of Devin mcin hes had a developing offensive season one of the most improved players in the league Zachary trying to beat the shock clock just got it off Madson the fade away no good its been a too pull off offensively for the Eagles shooting 10 0 for four from three and thats Virginias defense magnified yeah they just have not had any clean looks early on in this game credit Virginias defense and then on this end really theyve had issues containing dribble drives deep three for Isaac mcney post has the board Here Comes Matson the Cincinnati transfer pass from Zachary to hand M glockton on the weak side back to Zachary Matson hoist to three hes got Applause it first triple of the game for the Eagles and they needed that second chance opportunity great job by mton creating that extra opportunity for Boston College Groves in and out with the three and here comes Jaden Zachary Zachary averaging four assists per outing Junior College transfer from Chipola Community College driving and contact a foul on Virginia so Mason Matson with the first three of the game for the Eagles well his last five games hes been over 50 from the threepoint line Boston College those off of that bubble its never easy you talk to players you talk to coaches the 900 games are a bit awkward for them you know what thats like playing here at PC and maybe a little bit slow on the offensive end but I think for uh two things Boston College again their team as you take a look at Matson uh he has been the one guy we talked about his numbers the last five has been fantastic a the ball really well but anytime you play against Virginia try to get out in transition before that defense gets set and then Virginia continue to do what you do defensively but offensively youre going to have to have some success from Beyond The Arc have defense has figured out how to guard Virginia as Bros drives but the basket does not count but it is good basket is good yeah and look at this the great uh back door cut that time by Groves again nice action nice screening and and result two points for Virginia good ball movement but one thing that Virginia wants to do is get more complimentary scoring pakmans been a headliner they definitely need other players like MC Neely like crow like roie to produce as the fadea Away by hand is off the line heres Mighty in the post a raw 610 forward industrious and drwing contact hes a fan favorite he only averages 6 minutes a game but they feel like he can be a presence in the next couple years well hes got all the physical tools on display right here Second Chance opportunities gets the block sticks with it physical player going after it and again coach Earl Grant and staff talked about that uh when they do go to their bench thats the type of energy and effort that they are looking for two of the top teams of the Big 12 square off Saturday in our ABC mens basketball featured matchup at 7 rank Kansas against number 15 Baylor coverage begins at 1 Eastern in noon Central dont miss it Almighty a goty mighty a guy that only played in 16 games last year added some bulks but struggled from the free throw line former soccer player hes from Toronto hes only played basketball for six years Applause definite project but he has terrific athleticism has to work on the refined offensive touch as you saw at the foul line Groves and the rebound to Donald Han he will start of the game shooting 14 from the field plat Harris the Charleston Southern transfer and hes got a bucket hes their second leading score and you like his offensive game yeah great midrange game a God at hit his stretch where he was injured playing on a really weak ankle and theyre definitely going to need his offense thats a nice little offbalance pullup jumper against a very tough Virginia team punch away for a moment by Matson as ISAC McNeely tracks it down with under 10 to shoot Here Comes Dante Harris Georgetown transfer terrific move to the cup thats a beautiful move by Harris looked like he was going to go off that high screen rejected it and went Baseline nice finish Harrison 18 Games 2 and 12 points 32 assists 14 turnovers only a 28 shooter claudell Harris inside the elbow an erratic shot but a foul thats on Dante Harris but claudell Harris good move here yeah right here again off that left foot soft touch and then Harris goes right back at him again uh rejects that ball screen and then gets it up before the defender can get there and thats kind of a breakdown again Harris you want to allow him to shoot the ball from the perimeter give him space dont let him beat you off the bounce post and Zachary back in the lineup for the Eagles and the first run of Prince elag Bay sophomore forward come off the bench primarily this year for Earl Grant PC as a team 75 from the line another underplayed aspect of Virginia struggles has been their foul shooting theyre only 64 I asked Tony bennon about it before the game he says hes trying to figure it out they practice it a lot but you know can be mental and certainly the way that they play and some of the struggles theyve had offensively can you certainly do not want to give up uh three uh points from the fre throw line theres Zachary with a three and hes been much improved from distance at 36 he averages 12 points third on the team but they capitalize on the First Virginia turnover yeah and thats just a breakdown by Virginia they just left them and he was wide open that time from the threepoint line tane Murray in the lineup for Virginia inside as Jordan Miner with a foul against the Eagles as Ron Gro the veteran official calls him right here again off this little screen again nobody picked them up miscommunication in Zachary wide open looked like Brian Dunn was just showing on that but you look at what Jaden Zachary has done in his last five games is shooting the ball really well from the field and again he is the heart and soul of this Boston College team the leader obviously running that point guard position for Boston College and Errol Grant Jord Miner with a double double against Carolina on Saturday 12 and 10 heres a prolific score at marry ma playing in the Northeast conference this is his 14th start and theyve been a different team with him in the lineup again anytime you go to Virginia Glo its a a defense first system and right now though Quinton po starting to settle in but back to Miner in his production I think the biggest thing rebounding the ball again uh he has provided that physical presence in particular on the defensive and offensive class post fourpoint shy of a th in his bc career the double team against Ryan Dunn heres a three by tan Murray and hes got it tan Murray giving them some energy Off the Bench he came into this game 60 from the threepoint line in ACC play and again great ball movement that was a deep one with the close out in the North Carolina match up they hits his two 14 threes as Zachary works hard in the Post BC wants to to inspire contact in this game they feel like thats an edge their physical nature against Virginia yeah and they that time posted up Zachary they feel like he has some size on Harris so they just broke off the play and had him isolated on the Block first look at Andrew roie inside the threepoint line and hes got it they expected more offensively from him roie transfer from St Thomas 4 and A2 points and hes 27 from three if he gives them offense its a bonus yeah nice use of the shot fake that time and Defender flew right by and then right into his pullup jumper Harris picking up the loose change and an inside move for Claud L Harris scored over a th000 points in his career BC has made its last five field goals and its been off of their guards the last two ones that time a Claud aleris a previous possession they posted up Jaden Zachary so theyre trying to post their Music guards roie from three to strong and its BC ball coming up after this timeout but claudell Harris has been crafty Boston College with a trailing by three but theyve gone to posting up their guards uh that previous play Jaden Zachary posting up and then they go back to claudell Harris and when you play against a team like Virginia thats not going to allow a lot of dribble drives uh I think you got to find matchups that you like and then hope that they come in either double and then you go from there but that has been the strategy early on in this last 4 minute stretch I guess this qualifies as a prolific offensive output for Virginia 22 first first half points last two games 16 points in the first half yeah and again look their defense weve showed the numbers theyre one of the better teams obviously in the ACC but in college basketball as well too the question is can they create enough Applause offense post too strong with a threepointer Eagles now five for six shooting after a 3 for 15 start for the field beakman subject to any NBA Scouts first round and some boards air ball by Blake Buchanan and here comes Mason Matson Matson the fade away from the Applause elbow he has seven and theres a reason why hes been productive his last five games well hes more than just a threepoint shooter again he showed it on that play right there yes he can shoot the ball and hes been been shooting it well over the last five games but he also can play off the bounce right there again little Shake move and then a pull up so Virginia led by nine theyve LED since the opening tip tame Murray no good with the three Here Comes Jaden Zachary thats a nice blockout that time by Quinton Music post a league Bay averaging six points you like what BC is doing on offense well right now I think the biggest thing is theyre being patient a lot of that is though that Virginia D heres a shot you have to hit high percentage shots didnt fall for Virginia against North Carolina when they missed 12 layups nine times out of 10 Quinton post converts that nearly the fade away and Al Bay has the bre down Applause right Applause there crosscourt claudell Harris for three DC two for nine from threepoint L and thats a clean look again beautiful diagonal pass that time by Jaden Zach Reed and the reverse by Rees be and thats why it could be a first round pick yeah again he is so crafty and thats happened multiple times thats his eighth point in this game and most of them have been in the Applause paint elag Bay and Murray crashing the rebound Prince of League Bas still trying to develop a consistent shot well I think for him uh more get him in transition if youre Virginia youll live with him shooting contested pull up jump almost a poke Away by Zachary who plays tenacious defense beatman though steady as always done and industrious with the putback and he just showed why theres some NBA folks here uh today that length and athleticism something you cannot teach uh that is a ridiculous Second Chance put back by dun hes just got incredible length in athleticism 16 sophomore from free Port New York five double doubles including a 19 and 11 game against Louisville Prince El Bay with two to shoot bson no and Claude El Harris is hurt hes collided with Mason Matson hes being held up by Bill cumington hes shaky over at the virgia huddle clearly trying to shake off the cob whips and we will see more when we get back with the Cavaliers leading the Eagles by five Virginia has a 19 to9 lead in the series they lead BC by five but some scary moments for clao Harris yeah this was a pretty violent collision and a Claudel Harris really Im not sure if it was his elbow or shoulder but uh he went back to the locker room and he had to be held up and that is certainly not a good scene lets hope that young man uh is okay but again that was a pretty violent collision and now obviously the attention goes to whether or not its going to be anything longterm but thats a good sign right there though him coming back out of the locker room it looks like at least has regained some of his equilibrium as dun runs into a triple team and the beneficiary is Jordan Zachary Matson launches and Gro Scoops up the loose ball rebound thats a beautiful pass Again by Jaden Zachary if youre El Grant you cannot ask for a better look Matson in transition hes pretty wide open and again I think thats going to continue to be a formula though for Boston College get out in transition before this Virginia D can get set up DC is go for its last five for the field after going five for the last six scoring drout three and A2 minutes Miner put back done no and the tap by mlon Zachary in the open floor de mlts been quiet he averages 11 points shooting 59 and theres his first bucket of the night yeah thats a great use of of the rip through and then turned his body shielded the defender and went up strong thats a beautiful move by Applause mton Ryan Dunn the air ball but Jordan Miner good pass to Dun and a foul says Clarence Armstrong outstanding look in the post but Deon mton is going to need to get on track well this right here all set up by Matson against he draws so much attention and then you saw what mlon did there again shielded the defender went up strong and on the other end though done and showing off that length and Applause athleticism only a few games remain in the womens basketball regular season tomorrow night weve got two of the biggest on the schedule Elizabeth kley and number five Virginia test take on freshman Phenom Hannah Hado against number 17 Notre d at 7 Eastern on ESPN then on ESPN 2 Angel Ree and number N9 LSU take on Georgia a standing womens basketball action what a terrific season its been the headliner Caitlyn Clark of Iowa DC trying to navigate the waters what happened there well theyre trying to post up again a Zachary and hes going up against beakman whos the reigning ACC Defensive Player of the Year and one out on that 1 second differential shot clock game Applause clock bres before the shot contact and a Applause foul now Tom M glockton his first now on this uh last possession if youre Boston College all five guys need to be communicating again any pin Downs curls 58 seconds left you want to switch definitely dont want guys coming off clean and we will take a 30 second time out come right back to Chestnut Hill after this C by4 Malcolm Huck when Virginias effective we talked about their defense they force a turnover on over 20 of their defensive possessions past four games though its down to 15 BC has only turned it over twice yeah and I I think look its been a pretty even game both teams uh at times have struggled off defensively for Boston College theyve only got four fouls in this game uh right now though 58 seconds to go youre trailing four Boston College key thing is do not give up any uncontested jump shots beatman inbound guarded by Donald hen Jr finds Miner and theres a foul on Donald hen thats his first smart play again Boston College had a foul to give there yep still not in the bonus again dont want to give up anything clean only with five team fouls again the inbound by beatman for Miner Baseline done reversed no at the buzzer good idea but it did not fall so a grinder in chestn Hill as expected Virginia with a fourpoint Advantage well excellent uh again close out uh defensively by Boston College uh to deny done that bucket uh right now though Virginia you have to feel good youre going into the half with the lead uh certainly 27 points for Virginia and thats something they have not done in the last two games and and their leading score Reese pman has eight of their 27 points so halim at Connie for coming up after the break Kevin Connor Seth Greenberg and D cuff taken away in the studio coming up after this timeout its halftime and Chestnut Hill between Boston College and Virginia well be back after this with stats and highlights on ESPNU thank you former Virginia Stars Sam Hower is in the building speaking with their longtime sports information director Eric Bacher and how has been terrific offensive player off of the bench for Joe Missoula he really has and Tony Bennett has created quite a list of guys that have gone on and have some success at the next level in the NBA and Hower Big Time performer and playing a key role uh at the next level good news for BC CLA Harris who looked like he may have suffered a head injury is back in the lineup for them after colliding with his teammate Mason m late in the first half with Malcolm Huckaby Im John Perell great to have you with us from Connie foran Chestnut Hill in this ACC battle BC up set number six ranked Virginia last year in the weak side block by Matson so the Eagles come out fiery on defense a three by claudell Applause Harris Madson Harris not shot thats just the third three of the night for BC Second Chance opportunities coaches talk about that 5050 balls loose balls that time in favor of Boston College thats a great start if youre Earl Grant and Boston College beatman three for Groves he Nails it Virginia has its third triple in 10 attempts Jake Groves making his 12 start averaging seven points shooting 49 from three and John thats what you talked about the other guys look beakman uh and mcne those have been the main two scores for Virginia but can those other guys like grov give them Applause offense Virginia has led the entire way BC has never LED Virginia built a nine point lead early in the first half Jordan Miner in the post gets creased off by quick post post the take and a bit out of control you noticed early in the game he had trouble Gathering the basketball right here though again excellent ball movement and their secondary break and then a re Speakman setting up right here nice curl help is late and then grows with the three three and again youll see that time and time again uh with beakman he curls off does a great job holding his Defender off forcing that secondary Defender to come over and help first foul of the game on Jordan Miner with Quinton post at the line BC 75 as a team theres your Virginia Career assist leaders the outstanding Ki Clark with 718 John C Jeff Jones just announcing his retirement after his outstanding run as aead coach he leaves Old Dominion former Virginia coach but what a list that is really is thats an impressive list not sure anybodys catching Kei Clark but and nonetheless still an impressive feat by Reese beakman Lian Dunn whose brother Justin Dunn was a terrific pitcher for BC done of three its an air ball grov Scoops it up though and that was alacrity by Jake Rose and dun had a smile on his face I think he was smiling about uh give me assist dont give me an airball but thats a tough break for Boston College roves has seven so theres your complimentary scoring for Virginia with beakman again entering tonight last two games 16 points in the first half tonight with 27 Matson the three and the tip rebound by AR beat and thats a good evidence of his athleticism yeah nice little uh help out that time with Groves who was blocking out mlocked trying to keep him off the offensive Applause glass post with the Applause rebound Virginia with a plus three rebound Edge against the Eagles Deon mlock with just two first half points he averages 11 good idea on the Baseline no thats pretty good defense by Groves I think the keyang Groves didnt allow him to back him down and get two feet into paint great job dun eight points a game seven rebounds Rees beatman out of Milwaukee and he draws a foul Ryan Dunns brother as mentioned professional baseball player played three years for BC 27yearold Justin Dunn first round pick in the 2016 MLB draft by the Mets appeared in 32 Major League games with a mar and reds hes battled some injuries the last few years connecting with BC baseball players and staff in Arizona earlier this month when they played in the desert Invitational Todd inter jado BCs head coach in his first year replacing Mike Gambino who left the fence State and Ryan Dunn is large part of their defensive success yeah one of the better defenders in college great length in athleticism thats why hes on a lot of draft boards still evolving his offensive game but make no mistake about it one of the better defenders in college post with a quick three Tony Bennett calls him a separated and shoot it guy large part of their Scouting Report was trying to Sol him from distance they done a good job on him as dun hits the fade away from the elbow and Virginia starts to crank it up oh danger zone for Boston College again most teams you go down eight uh plenty of time to get back but with the way Virginia plays there very few possessions a key a stretch for Boston College right here Zachary with the bucket and the foul Jaden Zachary after averaging 12 points but done with a big hoop and right here showing off Virginia with a sixpoint lead over BC as the fans try to rally their Eagles and Jaden Zachary will be at the foul line after the foul was called on Jake Rose before the break Zachary trying to complete a threepoint play and one thing about zacher has been a spark for BC might have his stretches where hes not exerting his offensive influence but he does all the proverbial little things doesnt he yeah he does and 115 assists coming into this game thats the most by BC Player since Kai Bowman did it 125 back in 2018 and 19 and he does a little bit of everything for this Boston College team Groves has been hot post fighting for position blockton now to Harris Harris on the basine you see methodical offensively Zachary pushing it too strong though and Dunn clears the board yeah he just lost the handle got a pretty clear pass Zachary tried to do a little Up and Under and just mishandle the Applause ball and nice look for Jordan Miner whos coming off the 12 and 10 game against North Carolina Miner his first bucket he has four points hes from Kingston Mass south of Chestnut Hill thats all set up by beakman good blow by by Jaden Zachary so he gets more aggressive and this is a nice little battle between two veteran guards and the ACC Jaden Zachary and Reese beakman going at it two very physical guards Zachary first BC Eagle in double figures with 10 post has six points two point shy of reaching the 1000 point mark in his bc career in the Baseline foul says Ron Grover but guards are attacking each other yeah look at this right here again beakman has done this multiple times in the game again shielding off the defender and then making a pinpoint pass right here Zachary going right back at him these two have been battling all game Don rattles home the foul shot after the fou was called on mlock in his second Sunday the ACC Network caps the womens basketball regular season with a quadruple header that starts at noon Eastern featur matchups Miami hosting Georgia Tech at two and its Clemson and Florida State and we cap today with number five Virginia Tech against Virginia Zachary thinking about threes 36 from three on the season ly of shake beatman top defensive player in the conference the three by post and there you have it hes over 1000 points in his bc career and that is right there beautiful find by Jen Zachary and a giveaway by Blake Buchanan who couldnt handle it on the Baseline blob by Zachary tipped in by mton outstanding pass by Zachary and equally good play by mlock the body control and strength by mlock did the hold B to that ball and finish the lob my goodness DC has made its last three shots they have never LED in the ball game M Neely from three and post clears eight rebounds for post the L and theres your first lead of the night dein mlock in the slam Eagles Trail by as many as nine Tony Bennett needs a timeout well you cannot ask for better ball movement right here maton and then post to mton for to Alley Boston College takes their first lead DCs leading scorer Quinton post starting your feeling in the second half right here again Zachary nice dribble Drive post thats what makes him a matchup problem and then pinpoint passing Zachary to mlon and then again another lob to mlon this time from post and that gave them the lead the first one that theyve taken in this game and you look at what Quinton post has done nine points I think they the eight rebounds certainly has been huge and tonight a night he will remember going over his a thousand points uh a lot of those at Boston College and certainly uh he has turned himself into a guy thats going to play at the next level for a paycheck only major conference player in the nation averaging 16 points 77 rebounds three assists and two blocks per game Andrew Ro transfer from St Music Thomas for Ryan Dunn ree beatman shakes by Zachary the block by mton here comes quell Harris and what a defensive play by Ryan Dunn beatman in the open floor hes fouled a riot dun triggers it and thats why again look at this recovery again mton with the block I like it he keeps it in play but then Ryan dun look at this my goodness excellent recovery to break up a fast break Opportunity by Boston College done with 67 blocks first on Virginia he a 54 that foul shooter but he hits two as they regain the lead and beatman out of the Virginia lineup replaced by the Georgetown transfer Dante Harris well Boston College in this last 5 minute stretch assisted buckets weve seen some really good passing theyve been able to get the ball into the paint I think thats been Applause key tap pass by post to Harris and an athletic board by Dante Harris another aspect of this game Malcolm clean game PCs only turned it over twice Virginia has his three turnovers yeah both teams really high level execution and a block by mton but Buchanan picks it up for the dunk Blake Buchanan he could be a star in short order for Tony Bennett 611 freshman from Idaho his first bucket of the game and hes been solid defensively as well too again not an easy match up against Quinton post and uh hes done a pretty decent job single coverage jump hooked by Bon he picks up a foul on Virginia but Blake Buchanan impressive right here off the second chance opportunity Virginia up three as we get closer to the ACC tournament the barometer Virginia success this year theyre 9 and0 in games decided by 10 points are fewer nine of their 20 wins decided by 10 points or fewer well I think the big thing obviously defense travels and and thats something again weve shown their stats theyre one of the best statistically not just in the ACC but in college basketball question continues to be a cand they get enough Music offense Post in couble figures with 11 he averages 16 Zachary has 10 Madson has seven Virginia led by beatman 12 and hes on the bench McNeely handcuff by Mason Matson von Harris with three to shoot launches done over the top of mton Ryan dun oh thats just hard work yeah and thats really a big time offensive rebound by dun good defensive possession by Boston College but then done with the offensive rebound 13 rebounds a career high mton with an N1 Devin mcglockton with eight he averages 10 and a half but Ryan dun gobbling up rebound yeah off the uh Miss right here again in the paint using that length and then on the other end a Boston College Matson again playing off the bounce Mason Matson we talked a lot about his threepoint shooting Ive been impressed with his ability to play off the bounce that time setting mlon up for an and one opportunity two of the top teams in the Big 12 square off Saturday in our ABC mens basketball featured matchup at seventh rank Kansas against number 15 bayor coverage begins at 1 Eastern in noon Central on Applause ABC beatman back in Tony Bennetts lineup roie from the

players in the conference Jordan Miner and a foul says Bill cumington part of this crew with Clarence Armstrong and Ron grer and Tony Bennett not happy but what happened right here again thats that Virginia Defense Tony Bennett now is arguing he felt like Meers going into his shooting motion and theyre going to call it on the floor Applause and the Third on Devin mcglockton and some pensive moments for Earl Grant Applause 956 to go end this game and Boston College again defensively half the key in on this guy right here ree beakman keep him out of the paint roie for three done no a league Bay fights for it and a foul on Virginia thats onun is first thats a break for Boston College Tony Bennett livid did not think there was a foul there and again anytime youre playing against dun you got to put a body on him almost just face guard him keep him off the glass as he goes to the Applause bench bson to post easy two for the sevenfooter from Amsterdam beautiful set play and its all about the postentry pass again Matson showing off the passing ability nine points second half for Quinton post Miner swatted by post but Miner gets it back Jake Groves you got it big time shot for Jake Rose who has Applause 10 and thats a breakdown again uh BC staff yelling again you do not want to leave Jacob grobes uh stay home but cannot give him open looks Zachary the left hand and the hometown roll for Jaden Zachary hecs only LED for 61 seconds but they grab the lead back steal by Prince El look like he was surprised to get it after the beat this fire and and he takes it Coast to Applause Coast largest wiad of the game for the Eagles again Joe lardy has Virginia in the tournament but if they lose tonight he says theyre out three for Groves Virginia four of 17 on threes continuing their poor shooting from threepoint land and Zachary gets pushed and Dante Harris is called for the foul but Prince El Le Bay impressive well right here with the steal and then El Le Bay in transition take the hit and finish Boston College up position thats for sure and you were in Syracuse last night probably running on fumes I tell you what a good ball game uh here important one obviously a huge implications and the standings for the ACC and obviously we talked about it the importance for Virginia a team that right now is in but according to Joe lardy there certainly some work to do if they lose this one Isaac McNeely from distance oh boy he can hit that shot that was impressive and Great Lift by mcneel if he gets going its Look Out Below he has eight points well coaches love that again execution out of a timeout again the communication for Boston College thats key uh mcney again a great movement off the ball help is late Matson late on the close out and thats a pretty deep three by mcy m nearly 45 threepoint shooter first time and four games theyve cracked 50 points good look by post with the rebound for Applause Groves beatman always crafty at the point candidate for ACC Defensive Player of the Year again like he was last year averaging six assists per routing he has four tonight MC Neely again thats what they bring him to the arena four and thats a breakdown uh by quadell Harris lock and Trail he tries to shoot over the top of the screen you get pinned a fade and oh man the referee Applause down wow no comington down not sure what happened again now he either ran into a player or a coach and didnt see it but oh yeah yeah thats an accidental accidental shot from Orlando vandros who a terrific assistant for Tony Bennett just ran into the hand and comington was looking the other way its a great crew Ron Gro Bill comington Clarence Armstrong Gro was official in the last two national championship games DC director of operations Matt Conway on the floor checking on Bill cumington not sure Ive seen a flagrant file called on a coach this might be a first its going to ask you um but I I I didnt look obviously it was uh accidental you can tell hes trying to give instructions and I think hes going to have a good laugh about this one when he gets back to the hotel uh both guys again uh and Orlando V coming over right now and theyre having a chuckle about it and again uh Im going to put money on it that uh there has not been a flagrant foul called on a coach no that we could assure you now again yeah now again now I Love This Crew Im going to give him a flop warning on that one landro alandro is laughing about it as his pill com to good call on your part give him a warning yeah Orlando vandros from Brockton Mass south of Chestnut Hill and homecoming for him and hes had a terrific coaching career in his own right now yeah one of the best uh great man and certainly has some family and friends in attendance tonight so Bill Covington no worse for the we it seems haris to mton and the weide rebound for Andrew roie and pretty good action that time wideopen little Baseline jumper for mwac and just unable to connect beatman navigating Groves yes sir Jake Groves a redot second half Virginias riding a nine to nothing run and they lead by six and thats all beakman again dribble drives uh just break down your whole defense Fade Away by Zachary Off the Mark and the rebound for Blake fanan again Boston College High ball screens or just uh rub screens you have to keep beakman out of the paint it just breaks down your whole D what a pass by beakman and a foul on dein mcglockton on Blake Buchanan but Jake Rose has 11 points in the second half yeah but beakman really has been the Catalyst of this right here again in the paint collapse the D kick it out simple basketball and then on that previous play uh that led to banon at the free throw line beakman again manipulating the defense with his eyes and then a nice La pass come Virginia 8 for 11 from the line which is a good night for them they to shoot 64 worst in the ACC fourth foul on Deon mcglockton right now I think if youre Bost of college again under five to go but still run your offense through post let him get a touch and then go from Music there adsons been quiet in the second half and intercepted by Isaac m NE the take and the foul turnover is starting to pile up for PC after just two and again this is just a great read by mcney again uh not really a double team just an errant pass and mcney read that the whole way thats going to be the fifth foul on Deon mcglockton he has fouled out thats a loss for BC their third leading score has nine McNeil at the line for Two Shots MCN has 11 points hes made three threes and six attempts the match grow output and if you go back to the last two games for of Virginia theyve lost two in a row theyve scored 44 and 41 points so theyre well over that number and okay you know their defense theyre going to going to try to hold you below 50 so certainly if youre Tony Bennett you have to be pleased with your offense tonight 11 to nothing Run for the Cavs Harris and a foul on the Applause Cs its on Blake bu Canon is second seventh on the team post at the line tough stretch for the Cass but increased offensive output threepoint shooting has been there foul line shooting has been there Tony Bennett just searching for some improvement he had him working hard during their shoot earlier today and he knows the teams have defended differently because the book is out the shut down Rees beatman and you just need need better complimentary scoring well I think thats the key uh you look at the stat line tonight for Groves it was not just uh beakman and mcney they had that third option and I think thats been key beakman to take foul on the Eagles on Quinton post oh again uh beakman just in the paint okay poor communication by Boston high ball screen you cannot let him get down uh into the paint that time collapse your defense and you look at his statline hes done a little bit of everything he has been the key for this uh offense but freeto shooting again uh that continues to be an issue for Virginia one out of two for re beatman who has 13 points the big number for for him those six assists matching his season average which leads the ACC first round pick on many NBA draft boards viant Dunn also a first round on some boards and theres Post in the post after the terrific pass by Harris yeah thats a beautiful find by quadell Harris again he brought the defense with him looked him off and threw a bullet to post great hands and catch by post three yes sir Andrew Rs first three of the game Virginias made its last four shots beakman made that crosscourt pass look easy now he threw that with his left hand and that was pinpoint all he had to do was catch and shoot thats a beautiful find by beatman so cerebral post thats a foul on Virginia third on Blake Buchanan eightpoint lead and this is pretty oh beautiful find by beakman Virginia still on top uh hes defended uh but for me its been the assist a seven assist in this game that one right there the assist of the night thats a lefthanded crosscourt pass on the money and uh you look at what hes done throughout his career he reminds me a lot of Malcolm brocken again hes not as big as Malcolm brocken but the way they operate obviously defensive player the year last year in the ACC and does it in just kind of a quiet fashion I mean that as a compliment you look at his statline at the end of games and he just does pretty much everything for this Virginia team foul before the break on Buchan in his post converts but that beatman is a pleasure to watch only one turnover he has five second half points but seems to always make the right play doesnt he he does and right now though the guy at the line post also having a great year for Boston College and his last seven games he has been really good for Boston College right now though BC changing up the defense post has his eighth double double to the season with 20 and 10 hes now well into a th000 points in his bc career needed eight on the night to reach that Mark Dean and R gr calls a foul along with Bill cumington thats on Prince Elite Bay and thats been the area all game really in ability to keep Reese beakman out of the lane has created Havoc for this Applause defense 14 points for beatman who averages 138 that line tells a huge part of the story why they have a sixpoint lead and Zachary grabs the loose ball under three whats the offensive game plan for B right here uh give post a touch and play through him I think thats where you need to go uh youre down six 247 to go still plenty of time now Buchanan has played post well but uh thats why you want to go at him youre in the bonus situation no need to settle for jumpers of this uh at this point in the game again plenty of time left you Canon three and a half points three rebounds now with four Applause fouls great night at the line for Quinton post as Matson of BC has not attempted a foul shot but hes 29 for 29 on the season and we have a timeout we will take a 30 second timeout the grinder continues at Connie form Virginia leads by four if the season ended tonight the just win baby everything else will take care of itself you saw red hot Syracuse last night making a late season surge yeah judment looked really good in that game last night a big win at home bakman on the floor with McNeely grow Buchanan and roie post flashing out on him on a switch spin move Beautiful by ree pman so crafty and cerebral oh they had the matchup they wanted thats a mismatch Quinton post a sevenfooter on beatman he put him in the spin cycle and finished thats the first field goal of the half for beatman Donald Han getting his first second half run watches and he hits the three son of former Virginia star Donald ham senior under two to play what a huge Applause shot fou on BC Jaden Zachary his third right here again this is a big time pullup by hand and then on the other end though not a good foul by Zachary now again if youre playing beakman youll live with him shooting jumpers give him some space theyre crowding him and hes just going by him again minute 53 to go you just dont want to put him on the free throw line gets the Hest Applause roll foul trouble mcglockton fouled out pen with four Zachary with three theres two big ones at the line Virginia increasing its line Applause output 70 from the line tonight Madson two strong and beat in the board a pretty good look off of pin down by Matson again youll live with that if youre Earl Grant thats had a tough night one for nine from three coming in red hot averaging 17 points in his last five starts Buchanan Good Touch by Blake Buchanan the 611 fresh he has been solid uh right there again soft touch but his defense on Quinton post uh hes forced him into some difficult shots po dribbling like a guard and a good take by quick Applause post Bost College extends their D theyre going to trap see if they can force a Applause Music turnover beatman holds timeouts two remaining for both teams Scream by Music Applause Groves and a low dribble Here Comes zacher hand transition flx good defense by GRS he lost control well thats a great uh defensive play that looked like it was going to be an easy Deuce right here gets his hands on it and very fortunate and now again theyre going to go take a look at it to see if that ball went off of hand this is a huge uh review now from that angle right there it looked like uh its still going to stay with B atin College again you got a twoonone situation again cant tell from that angle of whether or not it went off a hand ooh now from that angle right there you cant really tell looks like I might have graze the knee of Donald hand Groves came over from the weak side but yeah I think thats going to stay with Boston College again it looked like again he got the ball its out of his hands as the review continues with Ron Gro and Clarence Armstrong we have a great college basketball Saturday in store for you on ESPN The Games took off at noon Eastern featured matchups NC State ninth ranked North Carolina at four and its Virginia number 10 Duke finally number four Tennessee and number 14 Alabama square off in the prime time matchup gets harder for Virginia playing at Cameron indor still waiting for the decision Virginias last few games coming up with Duke and then Georgia Tech and the ACC tournament in Washington Applause DC fans are getting Applause ansy now they one want to make sure they get it right Im not sure it needs to take uh this long but I dont mind them and its going to stay with Boston College so again I think thats the right call I dont mind them making sure they get it right now again right here great defensive recovery the balls out of his hands there and I dont think it touches him again no thats the right and I think thats the right call yep again though a great defensive play but to come back and recover Zachary inbounding to Madson the bump and the n one Mason Matson terrific body control first two of the half for Matson a memorable one body control off the charts Mason Matson take the hit hang and then finish with the left hand this is a big time finish a through contact and one and Blake Buchanan is fouled out thats his Applause fifth for those of you tuning in to see womens college basketball between Portland and Gonzaga we will lead you there after this game hes Malcolm hucker Im John me Perell producer Russ Ken director Mike Baker a terrific cre is the trouble an issue for both squads mton Buchanan out that Portland Gonzaga game starting at ESPN news right now but could be a fantastic finish BC to their credit to think theyre down they come back theyve outscored Virginia by one in the second half well key thing right now again theyve been hanging around obviously uh Matson make or Miss uh youre going to have uh to try to go for a steal and then youre going to half the foul youre going to either be down three or two after the free throw by Matson again you still have time to go for one steal you dont need to foul right away a try to go for the steel and now you have a chance to set up your defense Matson 30 for 30 at the line this year they defend the full 94 ft Neely trapped and Applause fouled Qui post this third foul now I think thats a breakdown again mcne in ACC play 90 uh so he is their best free throw shooter uh beakman the next at 75 so again if youre Boston College uh you dont want the ball in McNeals hands if youre going with the percentages I believe thats a breakdown Virginia 15 of 21 from the line Ryan Dunn inserted into Tony Bennetts lineup this is the key right here to make it a twop possessive Applause game timeout BC fourpoint lead for the Cavs two big shots for Isaac McNeely Eagles down to one timeout remaining theyll play Saturday here at Connie Forum on the ACC Network at 6 and the visit to Miami on ESPNU and then Louisville to wrap up the regular season before the ACC tournament again if the season ended tonight theyd be playing the 14 seed Georgia Tech on Tuesday a lot at stake as we get closer to March for all of these teams and as you take a look at the game summary uh make no mistake about it uh Quinton post big game for Boston College double double 24 points 10 boards and then on the other side Reese beakman has led the way for Virginia 18 points eight assists yeah its getting late almost night night night time for you Malcolm hucke Ill tell you what this has been a fun game back and forth both teams have executed in the second half at a high level offensively right now Boston College 251 seconds to go youre down four you got to go quick the league Bay will inbound to Jaden Zachary shot clock off Eagles upset then number six Virginia last year at home adson spinning on r Ro lost it Ro trying to tie it up and a jump ball possession towards P well that play took too long for Boston College again theyre trying to run a set play in this situation you almost just got to run a high ball screen and see if you can get post popping back out but they tried running a set play just took too long to develop and again against Virginia youre not going to get much go Music Zachary triggers for Matson step back three air ball out of bounds four ticks remaining Virginia 4 seconds away from its 12th ACC win well this score holds up that last stand again thats what a Virginia does a defensive stand they force an air ball to close this game out and make no mistake about it it was a grind for Virginia but they took care of business and went on the road against Boston College and for Malcolm
