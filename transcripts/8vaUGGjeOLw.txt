to go here tonight so that leaves the Hurricanes a little bit shorthanded here Miami final four team a year ago 10 and2 1 and0 in the league Clemson is ranked their 16th also 1 and0 this is a good early conference season litmus test for both of these programs Miami starting out in manto man youve got omir guarding PJ Hall that means Matthew Cleveland is going to have Ian sheelin and thats a a big task to keep him off the glass one of the best rebounders in the league base Hunter cant get a shot off shot clock is down to five Joseph Gerard III the former Syracuse Orange playing as a fthe senior transferred down to Clemson cant convert and back come the canes with Nigel pack but we got two guys in this game in PAC and Gerard who can shoot it from about as deep as anybody in the country kesan George misses the three and shefin the rebound Kean George whos into the ball game because of the absence of wga pap he is a really talented freshman reminds you a lot of Anthony black from Arkansas not quite there yet but hes got a lot of ability yeah Jim Lena just wants him to be a little bit more assertive because of all that ability and theres Matthew Cleveland the Florida state transfer to knock down the three and that pass was opened up by the penetration into the middle and Clemson is going to have to protect its paint against Miami they like to get the ball into the paint and spray it to open Shooters these are two good offensive teams each of them averaging in excess of 82 points per game and how about that move by PJ Hall well when you hug up on the hall he does a very good job of spinning off of contact thats what exactly what he did there and when he puts the ball on the deck hell often spin the other way dribbles right and Spins Miami can get some steals there if theyre alert to it George open in the corner and hell answer with a three second three already for the kanes well thats now 17 of his 23 field goals on the season have been threes youve got to run him off the threepoint line make him put it on the deck what a battle it should be between Hall and omir tonight now a steal though by benley Joseph and recovers to keep the possession alive for Miami Joseph one of the best defenders in the Atlantic Coast Conference just worked so hard on and off the ball George off the screen leaves it a little short haul down with a board Chase Hunter senior point y his younger brother Dylan will back him up and theres the Deep range and I do mean deep for one of the most versatile and talented big man in the country well you dont often say logo three from a big guy whos 610 that was a deep three by PJ Hall and well talk about it more as the game develops but hes healthy this year and that has just made a world of difference for Hall and the Tigers Hunter the pullup and Clemson on top boy what a great steal by Chase Hunter he he was right in the gap where he needed to be and Clemson does a really good job of Gap protection thats when youre a help Defender you get in that Gap off of your man but where youre guarding the ball n Chad omir will answer with a three of his own the big guys Trading long range buckets North Shadow Mir thats his 83 on the season he can keep you honest out there hes not going to hit three or four a game PJ Hall can do that good matchups all over the court sheflin with a jump hook a little strong and Cleveland down with a rebound Cleveland using his quickness against shefin sheflin is stronger but Cleveland is quicker take a look at Chase Hunter here off this Gap protection right there in the Gap just reaches in as Nigel pack comes around that screen and then hes a really good shooter and a good offensive player hes not at as many shots this year because of Joe Gerard transferring in from Syracuse but that was right off the Miami logo look its a big logo but still thats a logo three for a big guy impressive RJ Godfrey is checked in for Clemson 68 sophomore and there is Gerard doing what he has done so many times four years up in Syracuse and now in his Fifth Season using the extra Co year transferring down to Clemson and he has fit in seamlessly Brad Brownell tells us well hes so good coming off screens because he loads it up quickly if youre not right on him hes one of those guys you call a no closeout guy you should never have to close out to him because youre always on him omir with the rebound and the putback he is a beast on the glass goes to the glass every time and he carves out space both he and Ian sheflin are among the better offensive rebounders in the country Hall misses this three Joseph the rebound omir running the court and lays it in well as soon as that shot was put up omir was ready to go the other way just an in intelligent pass by benley Joseph reading the situation boy what a player nor Chad omir has turned into played more baseball than basketball as a kid but he is a tremendous basketball player as that one has turned over and well give you even more on nor Chad omir coming out of this break because hes going 94 ft with Jay bis on the other side of this timeout I wor long sleeves I didnt want to embarrass him with my guns hi were visible I think pretty much anybody would say weight room at least you could lie on the bench and say Im in between sets anything you can lie down Im in Im in on Im right with him on perfect day which is sleep get a massage and then go back to sleep and again he was a terrific baseball player when he was younger very good pitcher uh but he said he hit so well that the coaches when he wasnt pitching put him in the lineup at first base or in center field imagine a guy that size patrolling center field and and he had Pro aspirations felt he could have done something baseballwise but it looks like like hes chosen well in the basketball as benley Joseph knocks down a three thats the fourth already for Miami I think Jim Lara wants benley Joseph to shoot it even more he shoots 43 from three he doesnt want him passing up shots and just being a playmaker for others yeah hes known more as a Defender and then a distributor but uh as you say sometimes being a little bit selfish is okay if youre if youre a good shooter well if youre making shots its not selfish its the right thing for the team but hes coming off an 11 point 10 assist game against North Florida I think Jim Lara was saying that benley could have taken it more on his own in that game he liked the 10 assists but felt he had five turnovers because he was looking for assist too much instead of calling his own number and it looks like that was a long two so it is 15 to 10 Music Miami Hunter looking for Hall well defended by omir good duck in by PJ Hall and hell convert his second dunk of the night already in a whos averaging over 20 points per game of the season off to a very good start tonight and when you say duck in the ball was on the left side of the court and it was a coming back right he just ducked right into the middle of the lane and moved omir to the other side of the lane cleared out all that space that is hard to deal with omir drives and finishes with the left hand and we are seeing the best of both big guys early here tonight nor Chad oir is listed at 67 but I think hes more like 65 an undersiz big but hes just so strong way no way he called it this drive was made more with strength than quickness just got into the chest of PJ Hall knocked him back a little bit and was able to finish it but theres the duck in in a terrific pass by RJ Godfrey up top got the angle and delivered that bounce pass to lead PJ Hall to the basket Nel pack with a pull up a terrific screen by nor Mar Shadow Dylan Hunter now into the game taking the places of his big brother chase the floater will go for the sophomore to bring the Tigers back within three and that was all because PJ Hall set such a good ball screen to free up Hunter to get into the middle he just picked off the defender there was nobody there to help Christian Watson is checked in for Miami 67 sophomore from Atlanta Maryland boy terrific handle and a great feed but then an even better defensive play Air brought the ball back so he could really put the hammer down and Gerard just took it away from Applause him now watch omir he was trying to drop the hammer here when he puts it right behind his head Gerard just took it right away what a big time play by Joe Gerard Music Brad Brownell has been coach here for a long time hes in his 14th season as the Tigers head coach hes the winningest alltime coach at Clemson three NCAA tournament appearances they were just on the wrong side of the bubble last year they played a tougher nonconference schedule this year and they have done much better theyve got some wins that maybe dont jump off the page at you J but UAB Davidson Boise State at Alabama at pit South Carolina theyve got some good wins this year really good wins this is a tournament team it was last year they got jobed in my opinion pack for three Nigel pack is playing at both ends of the floor cuz he has to chase Joe Gerard around that is not an easy task hes basically not a help Defender hes just staying with Gerard yeah those two guys respect each others shooting ability both being great Shooters themselves no call as Godfrey lays it in Clevelands K as he gets H back up Miami four for five from threepoint range in the early going here tonight pack into the paint this time with a runner well you talk about a shot making team thats Miami and Nigel pack is one of those players that can go get his own Gerard and theres the Deep range and anybody who watched the orange play over the last four years very familiar with that Nigel pack went under on that youve got to chase him around that its easy to say its hard to do but anytime you go under a screen Joe Gerard is just going to stop and pop George tried to cradle it lay it in knocked out of bounds and we will step aside with Miami leading by three and Nigel pack and Joe Gerard j a couple of guys who know how to put the ball in the basket well its been a game of answers Nigel pack on one end then he goes under the screen and Joe Gerard just stops and Pops behind it when migraine strikes youre faced with a choice presentation of college basketball is brought to you by Progressive Insurance bundle home and auto and save visit progressivecom what a run it was for Jim Lena in the Miami Hurricanes a year ago is a five seed win all the way to the final four the first time this program has gone to the final for the second time for Jim larena did it with George Mason back in 20 06 and congratulations to the guy they call Coach L as he is a nominee for the naith Memorial Hall of Fame for the second time and uh you got to imagine at some point he will get in also wanted to congratulate Rick Barnes is a first time nominee for the Hall of Fame congratulations to Rick Barnes as well one of the rich basketball lives youll ever see Jim Lena played at Providence College for Joe melany and then Dave Gavin played with Ernie D Gregorio his senior year was a a great college player and he remembers specific details about your post defense in the early 80s when he was an assistant at Virginia and you were covering Olden colonies yeah hes well he remembers stupid details cuz nobody can guard Olden polyes well he was very flattering he said he went up to Olden Poes and said youre going to have trouble catching the ball the way that bis plays post defense three quarters he gets around you he makes it tough on you I think what he told him is hell foul every possession uh if you love stories Jim Lenos got them all and youre right whether its back to his high school days Providence early coaching days at Virginia and hes been a D1 head coach now for 38 Seasons I coached at Bowling Green then George Mason before coming here to Miami he just had an amazing career Watson thought about it from Deep Joseph on the drive the kick in the corner to Cleveland and the weak side rebound down to chase hunter that two3 zone really changes the tempo a little bit gives Miami a little more to think about Hall on the bench still coming out of the timeout for Clemson skying for the rebound is AJ Casey a 69 sophomore from Chicago Miami does not have a lot of depth in terms of size when omir goes to the bench Caseys got to give them some good minutes its just not a big team so they can get hurt inside or on the glass thats why theyve got to bring pressure and in fact the two games Miami has lost this year in both of them omir fouled out of the game they lost to Kentucky by 22 lost to Colorado by 27 they have won every other game that they played this season well thats an important basket for Chanty Wiggins he had a a great game against Memphis he had 197 rebounds knock down three Threes And if that was the only time you saw Chanty Wiggins play you say this guys a lottery pick hes an unassuming player and I think as he gets more experience youre going to see him get better and better and known more as a shooter but boy hes got all the tools where uh he can hurt you in a lot of ways Joseph somehow keeps the dribble alive they got the shot off but George cant hit but look at this cut and bodies are flying and AJ Casey just left the premises he went about 10 ft Out of Bounds at a foul called against Clemson and Jim Lena coming back with Nigel pack and nor shadir get a little more Sanity on the floor when you got Nigel pack out there he can create his own and omir is such a load to deal with he sets screens and rolls to the basket post he can duck in hard so omir back in Hall checked back in Brad Brownell about brought Hall back into the game as soon as he saw omir check in Clemson can be pretty deep beautiful play out of bounds and shefin bothered it just enough that Cleveland couldnt Applause finish Hall thats a very physical matchup tough turnaround comes up Applause empty Halls got a height advantage on omir but omir and Hall is strong but omir is in a whole other league it looks like of strength George from the corner and Miami stays hot from three but Miami spread the floor so well that ball movement just found the open person in the corner now Hunter has it knocked away Joseph created it Joseph runs it down George for three but George has so much ability a freshman from Switzerland also played in France some during his high school years loose ball down to the Applause kanes pack just short and the rebound for sheelin who is third in the ACC in rebounds per game 97 per game omir is second Armando Bott Carolina is first well shein at 17 rebounds against Pittsburgh another logo three for PJ Hall and theres the putb for shefin doing what he does best hes got a nose for the ball doesnt he hes fourth in the league in offensive rebounds averaging around three per game but just under 10 rebounds a game and you know sheflin gets really good position but he goes to the glass every time its not just once in a while hes there every time a shot goes up Joseph thought about it now tries to penetrate pulls up from the foul line and cant Music hit that voho here belongs to Brad Brownell the Clemson coach whos right in front of us we are about as close to a coach as youll ever be over by the Clemson bench we can hear all the plays being called out good game here Miami up by Music one theyre going to let you at three point shooting at better than 41 as a team and even though wga popper is not playing tonight with an ankle injury they got a bunch of other guys Jay who can knock him down well Miami is a spread floor five out team and when they get a piece of the paint they spray it out you cant get caught in no mans land between the ball and your man as the balls driven in you have to recover to your man and make sure that you can close out to make them put it on the deck when they get stand still threes Miami makes them from multiple spots Clemson is also a good threepoint shooting team theyre better than 39 on the season as a group and theyre a very respectable four for 10 so far tonight and the big threat is this guy Joe Gerard Nigo Pac has done a really good job of staying with him Wiggins the handoff to Gerard now shefflin will put up a three hes a guy who is freshman year didnt take many didnt make many but Brad brell told us he has worked awfully hard on it over the last couple of years and with that make hes now 8 for 13 shooting the three ball this season yeah thats his eigh three as you point out and hes really worked on it he was not a a a consistent perimeter shooter when he got the Clemson but hes gotten better in every facet of the game I hes a problem with his ability to rebound omir misses the three and sheflin down with the rebound sheins one of these guys you know who do for that loose ball who made that good pass he just makes winning plays Gerard with a great feed to The Cutting Chase Hunter for the lay in and one those cuts from the corner so difficult to deal with youre coming right down the middle of the floor and all of a sudden you get a cut you try to show a little bit to give the ball handler something to think about you turn your head and all of a sudden Chase Hunter is cutting back door to the basket a terrific delivery by Joe Gerard and this is the first free throw attempt for either team in this game as Chase Hunter was about to go to the line its been played with very good Pace very few Music whistles Chase Hunter is such an important piece in this Clemson puzzle a guy who can get his own shot he handles the ball for this team I think he needs to continue to be aggressive offensively they got a lot of experience Hunter a senior Hall a senior Gerard a fifthyear senior sheflin a junior it feels like its Clemsons time this year yeah you know PJ Hall told us today like his goal he wants to get to a final four hang an ACC Championship Banner which they havent done since 1990 good rebound by sheflin yeah he was not shy at all in answering that question you know how good does it feel to play for a team like this and you know what are what are the talking points and he said ACC Championship final four I mean he just he blurted it out George from the wing with his third three of the game already you talk about an unselfish team Nigel pack could have shot that ball benley Joseph but they both gave it up to get the better shot to kesan George when that ball moves it makes the defense move and a terrific passing sequence for this Miami team to get the open shot from kesan Music George what does George have nine points now yeah he is made three threes three of the six that Miami has the foul on omir Hunter to the Music line got a great womens college basketball triple header coming your way Sunday afternoon it all starts at 1 Eastern number one South Carolina hosting Mississippi State then Angel Reese and number seven LSU take on Old Miss and we cap it off on ESPN 2 with Carolina and Notre Dame from South B you see Caitlyn Clark last night at 40 again with game winner I mean maybe unbelievable is the wrong word its weve seen it so many times its believable by now Clemson by Music four BOS Lia into the game for Clemson now 50e senior a transfer from UNC Greensboro so PJ Halls back on the bench at least for a little Music while pack through heavy traffic great no look feed but Casey couldnt finish lighta just put a little bit of late pressure there caused Casey to readjust in the air he should have just taken that up to dunk Gerard puts it on the deck and gets inside and a foul call such good help by benley Joseph reached in to try to take that ball away but Gerard was strong enough to get it up to the rim and at least draw the Music foul got his arm there so Joe Gerard the native of Glenns Falls New York who scored like a million points in high school lman four years in Syracuse made over 300 threes was asked why was asked before the season why transfer to Clemson he said hey its nothing against Syracuse Jim beheim obviously retired he said I I wanted a different experience not only as a player but also seeing a different part of the country I grew up in the state of New York I played in the state of New York and you know he is very much enjoying his time further playing further south new bunch of guys and uh Brad Brownell said as soon as he saw Gerards name in the portal he knew he wanted him plus he didnt have to change his color in his wardrobe thats right just a slightly different shade of orange when he goes to the free throw line its almost like an intentional walk yeah the long and just a little bit too high for Dylan Hunter to put it down pack George is hot tonight the chip no but Casey runs it down for the hurricanes Cleveland Applause yes when Clemson didnt execute on that last opportunity gave up the open three and then the offensive rebound you know this is an important period in this game if Clemson can get some separation here Godfrey with an impressive Spin and finish for the Tigers well hes so strong inside and the answer at the other end for Matthew Cleveland to get him back within four we talk about Gerard as a transfer how about Matthew Cleveland terrific player leading scorer for the seminal last year hit a buzzer beater to beat Miami and now he is transferred down here to Coral Gables another one of the better transfer stories in the country sheflin Baseline got her well as soon as sheflin saw he had Kean George on him he wanted to take him down in the post and he might have settled for a fade away but its one that he can and did make but hes just stronger than George down there leveland the handoff back to pack still plenty a time good job by Clemson they put two on pack and made him give it up and he cant get it back Dyan Hunter wont let him George hoists it up and hits his four three of the game with the shot clock winding down so hes a guy Jay with pack out the last two games George started and now with popler out tonight George starting getting more minutes and boy as hes stepping up hes going to be able to play point guard at some point for this Miami team Dylan Hunter shein the rebound right back up with it and out of bounds to Miami well I thought sheflin was going to go right into the body of Matthew Cleveland after he got him off the floor but just faded away from the contact ke sea George is having himself a night hes got four threes and a game high 12 points in this one for Miami but Clemson can fill it up as well Joe Gerard can shoot it from anywhere the tigers are up by Music three Kevin guys thank you very much this one has been fun Miami LED early Clemsons gone on a bit of a run more Balan for Clemson Kean George the Freshman is already just onepoint shy of his season High these are two good teams do you expect to see these two among those battling for the top spot or spots in this conference yes especially Clemson you I think Clemsons got a great opportunity to challenge for the top of the ACC and right now I think theyve got to go inside to PJ Hall with n Chad oir out with two fouls I think you tried to get haul the Music ball get out of there now its Godfrey who kicks it to Wiggins boy good health defense good recovery there by Miami now the shot clock down to five Gerard the kick Hall gets it off cant hit it and the rebound down to Miami a good defensive possession by Miami Jim Lena talked to his team yesterday about swarming like bees to the ball and they swarmed to the ball on that possession pack almost turned it over kept the toe down Watson misses the three and an easy rebound for Chase Hunter a minute and a half to go here in the first half thats Watsons first Miss since weve been in Miami he was knocking down shots like crazy in practice yesterday I think Halls got to take Casey down low got it gave it back up and Hunter misses the three and over the back goes Godfrey I think Clemson is letting Miami off the hook right now with omir being out with those two fouls you know thats when you try to play a little bit of high low you know sheins out of the game but get Hall down into the low post and let him go to work against Music Casey George bringing it up now guarded to by Wiggins pack off the Stagger George up top and Casey couldnt slam it home everything was there except the finish and Brad Brownell wants a timeout here with 48 seconds to go in the half howd you hear Music that got some Pack 12 action for you tomorrow on E ESPN and the app Arizona they got beat by 18 by Stanford theyve actually lost three of their last five theyll take on an 11 and two group of buffalos at 930 Eastern the buff to the top the Pack 12 right now they have won six in a row Colorado is a good basketball team but just like last year you know when you say A teams lost three out of four or whatever they always think back to Yukon last year yeah you Yukon won their first nine games or so and then they lost six out of their next State yeah in January and they were the they were the best team Y and Arizona could be a a similar type team this year and and even this year one week if somebody said whos the best team you might say Arizona then you might say Houston then you might say Connecticut then of course you might say Purdue I think you do say Purdue I I think Purdue is the best team yeah but like three four weeks ago Yukon and Arizona were playing as well as teams could play and theyre both great teams still but this is college basketball it happens and plus Arizonas played a really difficult schedule I mean they play Purdue and then played Florida Atlantic and Florida Atlantic is legit something being reviewed by the officials right now Im sure it has to do with Applause time and Brian oconnell walking over to Brad Brownell to tell them whatever it is they saw it appears maybe its who the last foul was on I think we just heard Brad Brown L say how many fouls on 10 10 is RJ Godfrey and if the foul was on 10 hes saying if thats the second on Godfrey he wants to get him out of the game I only Godfrey knows it so originally I believe it was called on Wiggins but it has now been changed to Godfrey if we are uh understanding correctly Music Paul looks inside for Godfrey nice swing to Wiggins who hits the three great offense by the Tigers just great recognition to throw the ball out of the post for the open Three Time Out Jim Lena now a sixpoint game TLP 1 through row have stopped my Cravings completely a walk and again this year this is a terrific offensive team well youve got to be able to score when Godfrey got the ball inside going against Mike noo you just cant suck in against a threepoint shooter especially in the corner you caught that thats sort of a No Mans Land position for a Applause Defender George shut off on the Baseline by Wiggins kind of a scrambly possession right now for the Hurricanes but theyve still got time Chase Hunter had the steel but Geor just took it away from him pack forced it up wont go and now Clemsons got all kinds of time here to try to get one more Applause look Chase Hunter up and around but it rolls off the rim and thats after the horn after the buzzers so the first half will come to a close and an entertaining first half at that with PJ Hall and Clemson leading here he is on the roll replace action the shot fake the drive switching hands and drawing the foul Hall will go to the line the more Clemson can get into the paint whether off the drive or throwing it inside to their two big guys the better its going to be for the Tigers you know they theyve shot more free throws 5 to zero I dont think Miami shot a free throw in that first half nope and thats an advantage that I think Clemson needs to exploit in this second half PJ Hall suffered a foot injury in his sophomore season recovered from that and then in the summer before his Junior season suffered a knee injury dislocated his kneecap he played but he wasnt 100 his minutes were limited really until conference play last year and he says it is literally everything that he had a healthy summer in order to to prepare for this season and he is playing at an all conference level I think Kyle filipowski if you were to do the voting today it probably be filipowski and hall for the the best two players that we have seen in the ACC so far this Seas hes having a Player of the Year caliber season in the ACC and hes doing it on both ends you know shot blocking is an important factor for this Clemson defense he is the only guy in division one as the three goes down for Matthew Cleveland PJ Hall the only guy in division one to be averaging 20 points per game six rebounds two assists and two blocks thats about as versatile as it gets yeah would be Zack Edy but he dropped below two assists in that last game hes still pretty good though hes still pretty good yeah I think hes wide open Chanty Wiggins Hall couldnt Corral the rebound boy he had a gimme and omir getting down the floor in a hurry and laying it in thats the second time tonight where omir has beaten the the Clemson defense down to the other end of the Court Bo those big mths coring that ball when it was loose and getting it up on the board quickly gambled there almost came up with it and pays the price as Hall flushes it and Matthew Cleveland intelligently getting out of the way theres uh there are no more posters anymore now its like an nft to get dunked on omir for three and leaves it well short but Cleveland comes up with it you dont think that was a lob pass yeah Music now packed from deep and Miami starting the second half hot theyve gotten back within two and thats what I call getting caught in no mans land when the ball goes under the basket Cleveland had it down low helping off doesnt do any good you got to stay with a threepoint shooter Gerard not just a threepoint shooter and you saw it at Syracuse as well but having watched a bunch of Clemson games this year hes putting the ball on the deck and he is scoring in a variety of ways this year we look in better condition this year as opposed to last but Joe Gerard I dont know how many miles he puts on in a game but hes constant motion and to your point he was 205 last year at Syracuse hes 190 right now omir off the glass too strong good job by PJ Halla just Walling up and making omir make it tough too Gerard the pull up three and the rebound down to Ben Joseph and the Miami guards have to rebound on the defensive end you cant expect omir to get every board all five guys have to rebound Joseph no again our proximity to Brad Brown now allows us to hear a lot if not all of what hes saying and he is telling his guys get going get up the court lets go hes tell him to run yep now Miami doesnt have a ton of bodies so more you can run them the better it is for you chase Hunter with a strong drive and finish tough bounce pass in traffic omir saves it and will get an assist as pack lays it in a really intelligent cut by Nigel pack to present himself and what a terrific play by NORAD omir two years at Arkansas State player with the year in the Sun Belt a couple of years ago now putting up great numbers in his second year with the Hurricanes hes got over 1500 career points over a th000 rebounds one of only three division one players to do that and the other two are fifth year seniors hes a fourth year senior the officials just reversed the call they said that benley Joseph knocked it out of Applause bounds so itll be Clemson ball they have to move the shot clock back yeah Jim Lena not thrilled with the reversal of the Applause call Dylan Hunter lobs it in boy a dangerous pass its stolen and Cleveland will flush it I think jimera likes the call now all well then ends well isnt that a gut punch when youre inbounding under your own basket you turn it over and give up a lamp on the other end Gerard Music overpack and laid back up and in by shein but chony Wiggins did not have inside position but knocked it right to shefflin pack using the screen by omir and burying the three and what a game we got going here in Miami and no one was there to call out the screen we got to be up to touch yeah if youre going to get screened by North Shadow Meir you you would at least like to know its coming and youre going to stay screen Gerard no rebound for Watson Miami can take the lead well just too tough of a shot George and the battle for the rebound it is out of bounds with a Timeout on the floor and the second half beginning with as much fun J as the first half provided this is a shot makers game and weve seen that thats about as good a shot as you can get PJ Hall taking it to the rack but after the turnover Matthew Cleveland with the easy basket the other way and then you get a screen by nor shadir youre not going to be more open than that Miami back in it thats just kind of a life policy of your all right uh Im going to Michigan as well well now Im going to rethink my P oh yeah I know the first thing weve agreed on all day love Blake corm uh should be a great game and its coming your way Monday night 730 Eastern pretty good fight song though you may not like the helmet but you got to respect the fight song I think I think Hail to the victors is the best fight song in college football little weave up top for Miami looking to retake the lead here from Clemson pack got it to go is there a shot that Nigel pack can not make you Miamis got 10 threes in this ball game already Cleveland down but with the rebound for the canes if youre drafting in a game of horse I think Nigel Pac is the first pick in this gym tonight Gerards not far behind yeah thats true omir over Hall Miami by three why Miamis really turned things around and Clemson needs to go inside you know DJ Hall has a size advantage over omir not a strength Advantage but I think they need to let him touch it in the low post he is four for n 11 points so far in the game Brad Brownell wants a timeout they got to get things going offensively right now here in Coral Applause Music Gables hey Brent if you had Chad omir just every season keeps getting better and better and he helps Miami in so many ways getting the jump Hook off over PJ Hall just got oneonone in the post nobody came over to double and just got into the middle of the lane and he is a difficult cover can play out on the perimeter this year but PJ Hall in my view hasnt had enough touches in the paint now hes floated around the perimeter a little bit but I think Clemson needs to start getting the ball inside more start dominating the low post you know we were talking football if and Im sure Nord Shadow has a very bright professional future ahead of him somewhere playing the basketball but doesnt he look like the kind of guy who NFL scouting directors might say you know what I wonder if he could play some football there have been tight ends obviously who were basketball players in college you know Jimmy Graham right here in Miami Antonio Gates and nor shadir certainly looks like he could be one heck of a football player if you wanted to yeah maybe the best among them is Tony Gonzalez played basketball at Cal before going into the NFL being one of the best tight ends of all time nor Chad omir you know he could throw 86 mil hour as a 16yearold pitcher yeah first free throw attempt of the night for Miami over 26 minutes into the game after that last timeout Clemson ran something to get the ball inside to PJ Hall but instead of just going up strong he tried to get rid of it at the end go up and get Applause fouled Gerard off the screen deep three in and out and off the rim and another rebound for omir looks like he took a shot to the side of the head but hes okay turn around Matthew Cleveland and it goes well he knew he had an advantage when Gerard picked him up in transition and Brad Brownell telling his team pick up the pace man you know they lost a great player in Jordan Miller last year from their final four team and another great one on Isaiah Wong but specifically in terms of Miller if youre going out and trying to find a guy who could play that kind of a role Matthew Clevelands a pretty good fit isnt he yeah hes the one and Matthew Cleveland has terrific endtoend speed he can really Applause run a fivepoint game Miami with the lead and the ball George not this time hes already made four threes here Applause Music tonight Hall gets into the paint and itll go little jump hook for the answer to the one that he saw from omir at the other end this little dribble handoff action he kept it and got that oneonone in the post and thats where Clemson can be much more difficult to guard if they let him touch it more in the paint pack the pull up yes hes tough at least Clemson was able to get him off the three point line but coming off that little screen that stop and pop right now Clemson having to play from behind packed now with 19 he is the highest scorer in the game back door taken away by George just a poor pass from PJ hall and then George gives it right back stolen by Applause Music Godfrey Gerard is open but basically hes in range anywhere over half court Hall misses the three and its out of bounds staying at this end with the Applause Tigers Nigel pack without wga popper in there has been more aggressive offensively getting the screen from nor shadir the little stop and pop around the elbow its been a lot of pack line in this Music one last year the Miami Hurricanes lost lost only one game in this building and it was Matthew Cleveland of Florida State in a game that the seminal at a onepoint trail by 25 Cleveland HS hits a buzzer beater a stunning victory for Florida State over Miami and now hes a hurricane go figure stays in the same state stays in the same conference and he comes from Tallahassee down to Coral Gables and what an important addition he has been to this Miami team they are very very talented but they are not very deep and again you lose Jordan Miller a guy whos gone pro youre losing one of the one of the best players in this conference last year in a huge part of a final four team but Matthew Cleveland has fit in beautifully well he plays at both ends of the floor hes done a great job guarding Ian shefflin in this game and shuin is having to guard him right now and theres a foul on Chase Hunter and right now Nigel pack is kind of enforcing his will on this game heres our view theres Jay heres me and theres br Brown L right in front of us this is one of the rare times where were on the same side as the benches and were a little down from midcourt so could you tell Brad to move over a little bit so I can to say down in front excuse me Brad would you mind but you really not that its any surprise but you really feel the intensity when youre you know 3et away from one of the coaches all night long Nigel pack is so difficult to stay in front of turned the corner got right around PJ Hall picked up the foul on the shot when he CES off a pick and roll he can snake those things so well just go multiple directions not just a straight line off of it he is a difficult cover and to get his first game back after missing two games with a lower body injury now they were games that Miami you know no disrespect to the opposition but they were playing Stonehill in North Florida so they could you know they figured they could win without him and they gave him some time if it had been a league game a tournament game he would have played but he doesnt look like he has skipped a beat and again theyre playing without wga popper tonight who is having a great season 16 points per game shooting 50 from three second in the nation and theyre having this kind of a night without one of their best players wga Poppa one of the best athletes in the country ask jimer andega where does he fit on your list of be best athletes youve coach and he was saying well it depends off one foot or two Clemson also without a couple of guys uh who have been out for a while Jack Clark and Alex hemway and it was thought that maybe Clark was going to return tonight uh he had a sports hernia had surgery there it just didnt take there were some issues they had to go in and do it again and he is still sidelined and hemway has been out for a while as well with a lower leg injury thatll give Clemson tremendous depth when they get those two veteran players back both good players George called for the offensive foul Applause just a little lean in with that left shoulder but you can see Kean George hes got the ability he was trying to get the defender off of him thats little bit of a discard there at the end but I think Kean George saying to the official okay he caught me on that one what about the foul earlier they never seem to respond to that we does Clemson to go for offense they got a lot of good offensive players on the floor but they have been struggling here in the second half Hunter into traffic and it is deflected away no call Joseph in transition what a burst of speed and what a turnaround Miami takes away what looked like an easy bucket for Chase Hunter and turned it into a layup on the other end and right now Clemson really needs to get something positive going and a tough one for PJ Hall to quiet the crowd and I think thats where success flies for Clemson get the ball inside they havent run much of their high low game now in part thats because Miamis been very disruptive on the defensive end with ball pressure Joseph again Hunter had it but lost it and omir a block is called on Hall and Brad Brownell needless to say not a fan of that call but Clemsons been so close to finish plays here and there just didnt get square but close not not able to grab a rebound Corral it Miami gets it back you know its those little things that are standing in the way of Clemson being in this game but part of it been shot selection Dan I mean you know theyve taken a a fair amount of Threes havent hit any in this second half Halls third foul he becomes the first player of the game to pick up his third and he goes to the bench and itll be George inbounding for Miami the hurricanes with a sevenpoint lead pass the Midway point of the second half George off a screen Joseph bounce pass to omir well he was thinking that all the way just draw the Deep defense and drop it off and look at all the plays that benley Joseph has made for Miami since Nigel pack went to the bench hes just kind of taken over the game the last couple of minutes yeah hes taken it up another notch but you got to rotate down thats where chony Wiggins needs to rotate down take that pass away but just an intelligent job by n Chad omir of presenting himself in front of the rim on that Baseline Drive and a timeout taken by Brad Brownell for people just tuning in how has this gotten away from Clemson after they led by six at halftime you know Clemson IM bounc the ball under their own basket turn it over give up a layup dont finish a play Down Low slow getting back you know Miamis made some great plays but a lot of this has been lack of offensive execution on the part of Clemson you cant rely just on getting stops in a game like this when youre playing against a team offensively as gifted offensively as Miami is even without wga popper this is a team full of shot makers and Clemson has not done a good job on their offensive end of exerting their dominance inside against Miami give Miami credit because their pressure has been really good especially pressure on the ball so theyve taken away vision and one thing that that Miamis done a good job of theyve extended catches so Clemsons not been able to catch the ball where they want to get it and theyre out of operating areas at times so you saw there some of the numbers some of the the raw numbers Clemson shooting 41 in the second half Miami shooting Music 67 Wiggins gets to the Elbow step back jumper around and out offensive rebound sheelin and a kickball thats the 10th rebound of the night for Ian shefflin to go with nine points so hes on the verge of a double double yeah 14 rebounds against Alabama mention he had 17 rebounds against Pittsburgh including seven offensive boards boy good job by kesan George to stop that drive and not leave the floor on that shot FAS does a great job call covering a a smaller guard who hes really a wing but he can cover a lot of different spots and theres a huge and much needed basket for Clemson courtesy of Chanty Wiggins well they reversed the ball so quickly and the defense couldnt recover C but Wiggins to his credit was able to catch and shoot without hesitating now two3 Zone trying to keep Miami out of the pain Jim Lena wants a timeout to talk about it 302 timeout with 831 to go and the Wiggins three just bringing the Tigers within six this really good ball movement to get the ball from the left side of the floor to the right and chony Wiggins I dont think he has any idea how good hes going to be a teammate in high school lean shefin and Grayson Georgia but he needs to realize how much more he can do cuz hes a really talented young player mostly a catch and shoot guy right now but with tremendous Talent next Wednesday the Hurricanes tip off a basketball double header over on the ACC Network they will host Louisville right here here at the watsco center at 700 eastern and then itll be BC and Syracuse at 9 Eastern so we figure these two teams will be up near the top of the league we figure Duke and Carolina will be up near the top of the league Virginia a 22o loss for Notre Dame you know I think people very curious about what the whos will be this year Wake Forest is a team that really interest me they have won eight in a row right now theyre still getting healthy picked up a close win at BC on the weekend I think the Demon Deacons will make some noises here no Wake Forest is really good and youre right when they get fully healthy theyre going to be even better turn around by Cleveland will go well thats just a great individual play and thats not an easy shot to make turned over his left shoulder for a turnaround jumper that is not easy but he made it look easy Chase Hunter no and sheelan called for the foul trying to get the rebound just a little push off against Matthew Cleveland and Miami is starting to feel it right now still a long way to go how about Nigel pack 16 points in the second half and this is a guy a couple of years at kstate now two years here with the Miami if you need a guy to get hot and get the offense going hes a pretty good candidate hes baller an elite shooter and you cannot go under on him but he can spin pivot on drives hes got that deep range and there he is again right on Q as they say knocking down the elbow jumper hes a career 42 threepoint shooter over his four years at Kate and here hes made 263 threes in those four years and guarding a guy whos just as good shooting the three and can also put it on the deck in Joe Gerard and PJ Hall was in the low post trying to get open against NAD omir and I think his presence there just opened up that drive for Gerard still with this two3 Zone and Cleveland in the middle hell shift in and out of there he can be a playmaker there kicks it back out to George seven to shoot George Strip by Hunter Chase Hunter trying to go the distance and he lays it in but what a good sequence for Clemson and Chase Hunter just stayed right in front of George and took the ball away from him on that drive the wings are up here the corners can be open and theyve got size on that back line shefin on one side Wiggins on the other Hall in the middle omir traveled and the defense has given to Miami a little bit of trouble the last possess couple of possessions just gave him a different look and that covers up youre not chasing Miami around but just trying to get a really good job reaching in with that right hand to take it away and convert on the other end you know some of Clemsons offensive difficulties in this second half have affected their defense and this is where they need to go PJ Hall with good deep position to get him back within four hes getting the ball up top to Wiggins got high low look he didnt have any pressure on him and this two3 zone is making Miami a little bit more of a stationary offensive team Cleveland from 18 knocks it down hes dangerous there thats where he can be a playmaker hes a good passer but a lot of guys cant execute that midrange shot the way hes capable of executing it there are a lot of very talented offensive players on both sides tonight Hunter couldnt handle the pass Joseph the steel and the Layin and the foul and the foul what a big time play by benley Joseph looked like Hunter just took his eye off it thinking about catching it on the Run ball gets away from goes right through his fingers and benley Joseph whos a lefthander goes right to that left hand got taken out by Wiggins but still completed the play you can see him just catching Wiggins out of the corner of his eye just taking it up strong never took his eyes off the rim once he went up you know with guys like popper and Cleveland and omir around him Joseph doesnt get a lot of publicity but boy is he valued within this program well his pressure is making it difficult just for Clemson to get into something Nigel pack stayed right with Joe Gerard they get it down to four and now Miamis got it back to eight sheflin a corner three to strong bodies all over the place underneath with Hall and omir Boy George can really really speed up the court Canen he and he gets the assist on the three by Cleveland well it used to be you would run in transition for a layup now youre running for that threepoint line largest lead of the night for the Hurricanes Gerard yes well you come off him just a bit Nigel pack just came off him a bit its almost like you cant come off him at all just hes got to be a no help Applause guy Nigel pack tried to get into helps side position but theres no such thing when youre guarding Joe Gerard I call him a no closeout guy you never want to have to close out to him you got to stay with him all the time a touch for omir oneonone with hall Hall the foul number four Amir is just so strong and uses that low body leverage and hes a body Seeker he goes right into the contact got oneonone in the post and once he gets into your body moved PJ Hall back he tried to assume that position again and he was not happy with that Music call and a big change for Miami here in the second half omir has been able to stay in the game as much as Jim Lena wants him in there he had some foul trouble only play didnt even get to 11 minutes in the first half hes played almost every second of the second half and omir is a good free throw shooter shoots about 85 from the line and benley Joseph continuing to put pressure on Chase Hunter as he brings it up that takes time off the clock makes it difficult all the hand off Chase Hunter misses the three its loose and it belongs to Miami and a great hustle play there by Chase Hunter to prevent what could have been an easy two for omir who does a great job too running the floor Clemson just a little late in getting back he got two guys trying to Corral the ball and if not for that right hand knocking that ball away that would have been another easy Basket in transition just converting from offense to defense is such a big deal you got to get back find Shooters Godfrey in for Hall again hes got four you got the under four timeout coming at some point soon presumably so Halls going to sit for a little bit and omir is going to go to work on sheflin got him in the air switched hands and and laid it in that was beautiful and thats what you call an Up and Under move sometimes when a guy goes to the other side of the basket youll hear Hey Up and Under thats not what that means that was an Up and Under move thats a term of Art in the game a foul on omir was that an announcer Jinx he just talked about he had got a foul that must have been your fault nor Chad omir is big and strong but hes a whole lot more than that he is a tremendous basketball player as well Miami is getting it from all over the court the three from Cleveland the Up and Under from omir theyre up by Music 12 beat off to me will never steal from the week thank you very much a real Miami theme here on this Wednesday night and especially in the second half neither Nigel pack nor Matthew Cleveland has missed a shot in the second half then Villanova 85 esque in the championship game game against Georgetown Miami shooting 75 in this second half 18 of 24 and Clemsons gone cold especially from three now Clemson with a short clock and George staying with Gerard making him work I dont know if he got it off in time he did not is the initial ruling the the call on the floor is a shot clock violation now theyre going to talk about it though and theyre going to go look at Applause Music it yeah wasnt close no not close yep so the right call on the floor a very quick review and a turnover gives it back to Miami Kean George showing you another aspect of his ability at 67 he can move his feet and stay with a small guard and really make life tough on Gerard me the first time I saw kesan George in person was at Kentucky earlier this year and watched him in practice I mean he looked like Anthony black the great Arkansas Guard from last year yeah who was one of the top picks in the draft went to Orlando now with the Orlando Magic he doesnt have that strong lower base as Anthony black just yet but hes going to be a big time player Joseph no and off the rim to Godfrey Clemson needs scores and they need him quick and they need stops Wiggins will oblige with a three from the wing to get it down to nine and Miami doesnt want to take the air out of the ball they want to remain aggressive but you dont have to be in a hurry here Joseph and pack two very experienced guards good good ball handlers in the back court Cleveland Baseline and looks like Godfrey fouled omir Clemson was bringing two to the ball so they were trapping that exchange but this is a good passing team both are good passing teams and Clemson the number one assist team in the ACC coming into this game but this Miami teams a hard team to tra foul actually on shefin his second Godfrey comes out PJ Hall back in they need his Music offense and this is why you do Dan all that conditioning work is so you can hit free throws late when youre tired thats the 20th point for omir Miami has now 21 theyve got three players with at least 20 points in this game Packs got 23 Cleveland and omir each have 21 pretty impressive so George John Gerard and he lost him there they picked up a jump switch and Halls roughed up Applause inside or was it shefin excuse me shefin drew the foul and hell go to the Music line Applause tomorrow night got some Pack 12 action for you itll be Arizona looking to bounce back after the loss to Stanford they will take on KJ Simpson and 112 Colorado at 930 Eastern on ESPN and the app shefin makes him both and here comes the pressure one two11 broken nicely a little shoulder bump but they play on omir got rid of it and Cleveland got fouled and thats it for PJ Hall yeah thatll be the end of the night for Hall just picked up his fifth that makes that an even bigger play because it takes out a weapon for Clemson you know you look at the end of the night and Hall whos an you know Player of the Year candidate in this league 17 points 7even for 13 six rebound BS I mean he put up some numbers but it never looked like he was able to exert his influence on this game like he normally does and part of it was the pressure that Miamis put on the ball you know Miami made it difficult for Clemson to run anything with the the pressure and we talked about Jim Lena with his team yesterday were going to swarm like bees and bring pressure and its difficult to throw the ball inside when you cant see when visions taken away benley Josephs done a great job of pressuring the ball bringing it up so that the ball handler is thinking more about benley Joseph than he is about getting into offense and then even if they get it into hall now you got to deal with the the physical specimen that is nor Shadow omir down there omir doesnt allow easy catches Cleveland just tied his career high with Applause 23 and Miami again can be patient Brad Brownell wants Clemson to play it out doesnt want a foul on this trip under two minutes to go Joseph inside reverses and lays it in what a second half hes had how do you stay in front of these guys yeah and Bley Joseph has had a great second half and hes done it at both ends of the floor equally as impactful on the defensive end as the offensive end you know you watch Joseph you watch Nigel pack they play the game with a great demeanor with a smile on their face these guys are having fun and theyre especially having fun tonight beating a team that had only lost once all season coming into this game and again for those who havent been with us all night long important to mention one more time doing it without wga poppler packed throws it away to Applause sheflin chase Hunter 8779 timeout Brad Brownell with a minute five to go now its about forcing turnovers putting on full court pressure and its about Miami being strong with the ball and stepping to the line and making big free throws what does it do for a team you know pack missed a couple of games Poppers missing this game so they need more from other guys theyve gotten it from George tonight theyve gotten it from Joseph what does it mean to a team when somebodys injured and somebody else steps in and fills The Bard I mean its a huge confidence Builder dont you think to have keeson George come into this ball game he started the last two in place of Nigel pack but with wga popper out for him to have the kind of game he h when hes hit multiple threes hes handled the ball as a point guard hes grown up a lot in this game I think its just a a huge confidence boost so when you get wiga popper back he comes back to a more confident better team you know look this team wasnt lacking confidence they went to the final four last year but theyre missing some pieces from last years final four but theyve got so much leadership back with Nigel pack benley Joseph has grown even more and you know he stepped forward tonight and played just a a a fantastic game at both ends of the floor but this second half performance was just magical with the way they played offensively they were down six at halftime 4135 so Miami has scored 52 points in the second half of this Music game and pack Cleveland and omir first time this year that theyve had three scores with 20 or more that doesnt happen very often in a college Music game Clemson again will bring the pressure and you have to expect that theyre going to go after the ball so the first thing is make a catch and a foul before they even Music inbound thats the 10th team foul so its two free throws the rest of the way for Miami as Brad Brown Al is now making some offense defense substitution shefflin and Gerard getting ready to come back in Music shoo Jim Lena can sleep well at night knowing his team shoots 79 as a team from the line on the season you talked about omir packs a very good free throw shooter Joseph is a great free throw shooter his team has f and he I would imagine that Jim lar would be a fun coach to play for hes always positive Applause y best whistle in in all of college absolutely hes a one seed in that department thats for sure Wiggins for three you know Jim Lena keeps a a book of things that he wants to do like its almost like a bucket list book yeah he told me last time we were together in in Kentucky said that hes never going to attain his number one number one thing on his bucket list hang on it wasnt finishing on an alleyoop thats not number one on his bucket list no number one for him is get a tan and he just cant he doesnt think itll ever happen he says he turns red well hes in the right place to try thats for sure y Gerard open for a three well this is a really big win for Miami without wga popper against an excellent Clemson team when everything seemed against you to be able to come into this game and play this kind of second half and walk out of the watsco center with a win and if youre Clemson you got to try to regroup in a hurry youre home to North Carolina on Saturday so thats another big time matchup for the Tigers Miamis next game they got a tough one too they are at Wake Forest Saturday afternoon those are two good meaningful games early on in conference play one at a time Dan got to take him one at a time Jay dont you know when the playbyplay handbook it says in a 10point game in the last minute talk about who they play Laughter next were on our way to Gainsville we will see Kentucky in Florida Saturday afternoon you better be ready for a track meet there because kuy is one of the best transition teams in the country oh a steal by Joseph and hes slams it home the exclamation point on a very very good night for the Hurricanes who thought at halftime that Miami have 95 by the end of this one 60 in the second half the shot clock is turned off 74 shooting 60 points in the second half and a standing ovation from the crowd here in Coral Gables and well deserved what a second half by the hurricanes big big win for Coach L as they call him in the Hurricanes beating Clemson 95 to 82 both teams now 112 in the
