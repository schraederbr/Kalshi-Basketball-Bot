runs the floor defensive presence but his offense really has been the big key this year for this Miami team hes been really good for them efficient from the floor Syracuse on the road in the orange uniforms Miami here at home in the green Eric Lewis Pat Driscoll Tony chazza the three officials tonight Miami opened up ACC play 0 and 10 but theyre trying to make it wins in two of their last three as they work against this zone of Syracuse Matthew Cleveland hangs in the air gets the boun and the guy who scored 20 and six straight as an early bucket Syracuse starting lineup tonight talked about JJ Starling great guard but jier Davis has picked up his production recently lamin the big man Starling darts to the Lane flips it in with the left to even the score early and thats set up by lampin setting a screen again A lot of times we dont talk about bigs that screen Eddie lampin that time said a hard screen for JJ Starland freed him up to get down the lane excellent screening early on LY kid has his hands full with lampin those two going at it in the post here Brandon Johnson seven to shoot kicks Cleveland spots up buries the three five straight early in the game for Matthew Cleveland I was here two hours before the game Matthew Cleveland was out here by himself taking those exact shots his improved offensive production in particular from Beyond The Arc I think a big reason why hes going to play at the next level in the league lamin wont get the bounc you beat it to me Huck I had that I had that lined up as well I was going to talk about how he was the first one out on the floor two hours before its again to show the work that he has put in really is paying off lint kid wont get it to go at the left and lamin who had 18 rebounds the other night has his first and we talk with red before the game he said the one thing theyve really done well is rebound the ball big reason why Eddie Lin again hes a guy leads the ACC close to four offensive rebounds per game thats just a big body down there bouncing around right on Q he just uses his body really well if youre Miami youre going to have to start thinking about digging or doubling again I think thats a tough matchup for Len kid giving up a lot of size he didnt have to worry about an offensive rebound that trip no Brandon Johnson kicks it back out Cleveland whos got all five for Miami had it tapped from behind by JJ Starling hes got a twoonone Glides to the rack and flips it in one of the most difficult guys to stop in transition once JJ Starland gets a full head of steam good luck trying to keep him out of the paint that is a tough move in transition by one of the better guards in college basketball 28 in that triple overtime win against Boston College Jal Betha has the answer right away for Miami well Scouts are here for this guy as real too uh Jalil Bea again came in with a big repetition thats a nice under contr control pullup jumper hes one of the more athletic freshman youll see in college basketball fivestar recruit was a top 10 player in high school last year a lot of expectations were on him coming end of this season fway jumper wont go for jier Davis true freshman point guard here uku Cleveland absorbs contact and hes got free throws coming up Bill Courtney is the interim head coach for Miami took over 11 games ago December 26th at their Jim Lena announced he was stepping down did miss the last game due to illness good to see him back and healthy on the sideline first thing we asked him today how you doing he said Id much rather be here than where I was last game and hes done a nice job again we walked into this shoot around the energy was different they had a nice win against Notre Dame at Louisville again you look at that score they were right within uh Arms Reach of Louisville a team that I think is going to be a deep NCAA tournament run typee team theyre very good so again doing a nice job keeping these guys focused and also energetic and Louisville has been blowing teams out recently too I had them against SMU on the road at SMU and it wasnt close uh again theyre very good so again credit uh to coach the coaching staff of Miami doing a good job keeping these guys focused we saw the energy again it was real the guys were locked into the scouting report it was energetic shoot around and again not an easy circumstance for them to be under as we take Eddie lampin flying down the lane with the hammer we talked about it in the tip again his energy his presence and the post thats a nice little pass and finish by lampino pulls Syracuse within a point a little over four minutes in chuk will miss fires on the three kid had the rebound and a whistle against Syracuse we talked with him uh prior to the game about his progression as a coach and we equated it to coming in as freshman and in that sophomore year and certainly again its a process dealing with some injuries as well without some key players for the season now and obviously a big portion without JJ Starling uh his best player so ly kid hits that jumper to give Miami a threepoint lead yeah not many teams have had to go multiple games without their two best players thats been the case this year for Syracuse certainly again you look at any team around the league I dont care if its Duke you take away Cooper flag and canle or you take with uh Louisville you take away heurn or rain Smith youre going to struggle Cleveland finishes nine early points for Matthew Cleveland whos been on a tear in the last six games well Eddie lampin though right now shaking up again I didnt see it on the play what happened but looks like hes bleeding down on the Baseline right now getting attended to and again we were blocked out but theyre going to take a look at what happened again from our angle we couldnt really see we were focused on the drive by Cleveland well he has to take a seat now with nahim McLoud this 7 fo4 senior replacing him and the officials over the monitor theyre going to take a look at this and see if there was any sort of contact there and you said 74 Nima Cloud but right here again take a look drive by Cleveland I think maybe that off arm yeah butel really from that angle still a little blocked out but I dont think anything other than a guy just trying to Shield off somebody yeah thats where it was right there yep now again I dont think its its a natural reaction guys coming up trying to block it its not a flagrant where hes wanted and I like what this officiating crew did veteran crew took a look saw look it was a basketball play it wasnt a guy winding up trying to throw an elbow its a guy going up and Ive been in that situation in games youre going up against a big theyre trying to block your shot quick Bert for Miami out of the timeout theyve scored the last four got a fivepoint lead a little more than 5 minutes in Elijah Moore true freshman who was a big boost on Saturday tend to shoot more elevates to strong McLoud brought it down and had it whisked away from him and thats the key thing when he gets that hes got to Chin it can cannot bring it down give those guards a chance to get that the lob inside heres kid surrounded by the entire team for Syracuse its blocked from behind and then kid was the last to touch it Syracuse ball and thats great team defense youre absolutely right uh Miami recognized the mismatch throw it over the top but thats great help defense they came and doubled forcing a turnover excellent team defense by Syracuse Syracuse trying to make it backto back wins after the three overtime winner against Boston College on Saturday quick turnaround for them after a marathon of a game Starling lobs it inside deflect it away UGA chuku got a hand on it but Syracuse still has it Starling loves and its thrown down by Davis hustle play thats all set up by JJ Starling getting a 5050 ball again those little things add up right there excellent hustle and then heads up play to throw to L by J Starling and Syracuse has switched up their defense they shown a little bit of zone now theyre back manto man for to shoot uku for three short Clouds there to snag the rebounds is that just a matter trying to keep them on their toes Miami offensively I I think so absolutely and again give them different looks thats time forced a long contested three and the key thing is they cleared the defensive rebound again back to the earlier Point red U when we spoke to him he said look thats one of the things theyve done pretty well defensive rebound tough shot halfway down before popped out by Taylor its a one and done for cuse Johnson thought about it extra pass Corner Bea down and out transition that thr is blocked by Cleveland almost got a steal but it leads to a wide open look for Taylor too strong Uka two on three doesnt matter hes going right at him and finishes beautiful Yuro step that time in transition strong move had 10 points against Louisville this week and the most hes had in in an ACC game for the true freshman Music Moore does not have the answer Cleveland battling with McLoud for the rebound it stays with Syracuse well the Freshman right here hes shooting the ball well from the threepoint line and hes one of the best defenders in college basketball he can guard really one through four uh defensively thats his bread and butter but then when hes added that offensive Firepower as well too hes going to be a guy I think is going to play at the next level in the league two years at Florida State now two with Miami and when he came in he was ready defensively but took him a little bit to get the offense going that is swatted by Bea the true freshman for Miami when we spoke with coach Bill Courtney about Jalil Betha uh he said thats the biggest area of improvement that theyve challenged him to look they know hes talented offensively will he get after it on the defensive end they said he has stepped up as of late and been better on the defensive the side of the ball reload for three and it goes through thats Paul J sophomore from France checks in immediately makes an impact to give Miami their largest leate of this first half if Im Syracuse i give Eddie Lampkin a touch in the post let him get a couple of post touches see if you can play through him he sets about four screen in the matter of five seconds has the ball the post six to shoot kicks out Bell steps into a midrange jumper or and he cans it thats nice offense by Syracuse again give lampin a touch force Miami to double if they dont let him go to work that time lampin throws it out and bell with a nice little head fake and then pull up jumper excellent patience and spacing by Syracuse well thats the thing he doesnt always need to score it but you get him a touch good things happen well good things happen when Clevelands got it wave off the butt it though they say its on the floor he cant believe it now I know the NBA Scouts are here but thats definitely youre not going to get that continuation right here again yeah right there clearly on the floor uh before he started his shooting motion but again I like what Miamis doing again they like that matchup well theyre just going to isolate him on the wing for Syracuse to make a decision hes got the height advantage on Kyle cuff faces up against him here helps side comes over cant connect Eddie lamin snatches the rebound thats a great uh Team defense Again by Syracuse coming over and giving some help to Cuff whos giv up a lot of size post feed to my stovich who spins Baseline drops it off for lampin whos got two free throws headed his way great interior passing that time my stovich to lampin again big to big and thats I think the area right here again if youre Syracuse play through your post players let those guys get touches and then Force again Miami to make a decision that time M storic with the clear size advantage on Cleveland Miami came with the double mic gave it up early great pass from one big man to another Eddie lamin hits the first free throw Music four quick points for Syracuse and the orange have cut the deficit to four mway Mark of the first half yeah and lampin screaming at his teammates encouragement hey lets go uh they understand the importance of this game Paul chob wont get the bounce heres cuff all the way to the cup its blocked and last off of Syracuse Miami ball thats another great recovery that time in transition thats twice now Miami has gotten back in transition come up with blocks this time right here they get a turnover out of it again this is just great hustle looked like cuff was going to have a uncontested layup both of those blocks by freshman too recovering in transition for the Hurricanes heres kid he wants the isolation oneonone against lampin hooks it up but left it short Carlos bounces to Cuff skip Bell elevates for three and buries it great offense Carlos and cuff dribble Drive collap the defense and then thats a breakdown if youre Miami Bell is the one guy you cannot give him any space excellent spacing again and passing by Syracuse lampin got the block but then the second effort from AJ Stan McCrae ends a 70 run for Syracuse lamin working on kid there is a whistle and if thats on kid thats two but its not its on AJ State McCrae again right here again look at the ball movement cuff with a beautiful diagonal pass and again thats a breakdown Miami theres guys in The Scouting Report that you cant leave Bell still one of the better threepoint Shooters in the ACC and again you give him airace hes pretty much going to make you pay if you give him that much room and time he got off to a little bit of a slow start shooting wise this season but Adrian ay was telling us right before the game today he said his play is caught up meaning the shooting has started taking off for Chris Bell the last few games and I think you know we talk with uh the great Sid Pete Moore about just his mindset and red auu was there as well too and him coming off the bench I think relieved him a little bit now hes not worrying about you know am I coming in and out of the game hes getting a different perspective and he comes in Off the Bench and his production theyre going to need it UK wo draws a whistle its so nice to be able to bring that kind of offensive threat Off the Bench too well for me Chris Bell still one of the more talented players uh in the uh ACC obviously weve talked about his shooting but I think the thing that red Ary talked about as well too is his defense is cant just be a shooter we need his defense and rebounding when hes in the game as well Music too K has oneonone against lampin again three to shoot Joe b gets all the way to the basket and lays it in thats a beautiful hesy froze him and then went strong with the left and Bell was standing on the sideline Syracuse turnover got a good one dont we we do and look the deciding game yes for them now again they got a tough road four their last seven on the road but they got to go to Pittsburgh have to go to SMU Virginia Tech but again games like that when you look back and how tight it is for making the ACC tournament thats one certainly you want to Mark Brandon Johnson cant connect on a three out of the timeout yeah certainly when youre just a half game up on the 15th and final spot for the ACC tournament any win you can get is crucial lamin deep post position thats an easy two if Im Syracuse Im giving him a touch every time uh he was so pretty much underneath the basket if he gets that good a position throw it to him and now Miami its not even a question you got a double in particular when he catches the ball that deep AJ State McCrae whos coming off a season High 22 against Louisville drills the three and then on the other end right now its just too easy Miami getting high percentage looks myovich bounces this is cuff Rising for three no and the balls stuck thats can you climb up there and get it no I certainly am not Im not even sure if theyre going to be able to knock that one off that is a weird spot now look at our camera guy yeah beat the broom there we go save the day but back to that previous possession uh Eddie lampin had great post position thats a missed opportunity again even if youre open in that situation if hes got the ball if he catches the ball two feet underneath the basket you got to throw that one to him right there hes got 10 points and two assists already so about 2third of the points have come through Eddie lampin for Syracuse ston McCrae gets into the center of that Syracuse defense Johnson kicks to the corner luga chuku back to Johnson Four to shoot they got to get something up one to shoot Schwarz Way Off the Mark and lamin snacks his third rebound and that might be Syracuse best defensive possession got Miami deep in the shot clock closed out and forced a deep contested three Bell attacks Baseline squeezes through the defense doesnt get it to roll through but he is fouled and back to this previous possession again look at Eddie lampin where hes at right there that ball needs to be entered into the post to him right there number 44 again thats a missed opportunity right there hes got it going early be patient if it comes off of a kickout off of a double yes but he needs to get a paint touch pretty much I think every offensive possession in particular with Len kid on the bench well that Miami also hasnt shown an answer for him defensively yet either no they have not and lampin again amped up in this game doing a nice job establishing post position Chris Bell already has seven Off the Bench for Syracuse that was the second foul on AJ State McCrae for Miami UGA chuku kicks Johnson over the top of lamin way too strong Starling look at the speed accelerating into the lane and fls it in Im going to say it again once he gets ahead of steam going in transition good luck trying to keep him out of the paint great body control and strength finishing through contact Johnson Blows By on the Baseline but throw it Applause away pass tipped and Johnson intercepts it Miami has numbers Cleveland splits the double team and lays it in hes already got 11 both teams getting up and down in transition Cleveland again another tough finish and hes already in double digits in the first half 17th time this season hes had at least 10 he scored 20 plus and six consecutive entering tonight now hes got the defense on Davis to force the Miss offensive rebound lampin and hes fouled the accs best offensive rebounder earns a trip to the line for a second chance you better put a body on Eddie lampin again you said it uh the best in the ACC close to four offensive rebounds per game I just love how he uses his body again you better find him early cuz once hes around the basket youre not going to move him he took another shot to the face on that one too thats the second time thats happened to him it has but hes giv out a lot of those as well too hes had guys bouncing off him and uh right on Q the answer get Len kid back into the game to try to match up with lampin and both these bigs we talked about it no theyre so efficient both guys shoot a very high percentage from the floor the free throw line today too Freddy lampion hes just a 54 free throw shooter but now six of six and Im not sure why its that low cuz hes got nice mechanics it doesnt look like its an awkward or funky shot so certainly its been huge since hes been at the line a lot ug chuku rattles in the three to give Miami the lead back true freshman that they planned on red shirting this year but had a great summer coaching staff sat down with him and his family and said we think we can benefit from having you play this year right away and they are certainly glad they went that route bell with a step back three hes got the immediate response red Ary talked about his production as of late and its been huge guy playing starter minut its still one of the better offensive threats in the ACC and Jalil betho with the Music answer great look from the corner short this time though from Starling and great block out that time by Len kid keeping Eddie lampin off the glass he now gets a Touch faces up against lampin and knocks down a midrange jumper Music look at kid getting out on the Hedge Davis kicks Corner Bell steps in 15ot Baseline jumper is pure thats beautiful and Chris Bells done that twice now in this game everybody knows he can shoot poor close out little ball fake and then nice onew pullup jumper excellent offense by Syracuse and Patience by Chris Bel Bea we are just trading buckets back and forth oh we said theres a lot of NBA Scouts five in the building they are getting a offensive show The Freshman baa five straight makes from the field for Miami the lead is now five for the Music canes Carlos has five to shoot Works into the Lane Falls away too Applause strong huku all the way to the basket make it six straight makes from the field for the Miami and the hurricanes have stretched that lead out to seven timeout Syracuse Syracuse we talked with Coach red ay about it he said look our transition defense has not been good as of late we must do a good job against this Miami team in transition defense well now theyre picking up the defense Too Syracuse gets a good look from Bell thats his first Miss of the day after starting four for four and its Miami Bull you cant ask for a better look again Miami changed their defense up went full court they broke it patient Chris Bell wide open in the corner uh youll live with that if youre coach red ay thats a pretty good look 92 run for Miami since this was tied 30 to 30 a couple minutes ago thanks to six straight makes by Miami Cleveland spins got Bell up in the air and free throws are coming for Matthew Music Cleveland Matthew Cleveland got out to such a hot start and as we take a look Jal Betha early on he would have probably thrown that lob again thats a heads up play its little things uh again his progression when we to talked with coach Bill Courtney about Jalil Bea he says its the little thing look hes uh probably one of the most talented freshman that weve had in quite some time in terms of offensively but its little things like that may not show its not going to show up in The Scouting Report but again understanding what theyre doing not throwing the ball away not throwing that lob it wasnt there made the extra pass and then got Cleveland posted Davis pass deflected and its a backourt violation not just the offense that were talking about for Miami but the defense has picked up too well theyre question right now JJ Starling saying again he didnt touch it again lets see oh there you go yeah now lets see yeah again yeah he didnt I he didnt touch it and it was deflected off Miami deflected it now he was in on the opposite side not backourt when he caught it went to make a jump pass but deflected by Miami good job by the officials so Syracuse does keep the basketball trying to cut into this ninepoint deficit minute and a half before halftime Starling no kid the rebounds Miamis got a chance to grow what is already their largest lead of the day three swirls out from Cleveland Taylor gets into the lane ran into his own Applause teammate Carlos Rejects the screen kicks it out heres Taylor five to shoot Carlos attacks Baseline over two Defenders know but Cloud the offensive rebound and stick back grown man move and thats what red ay said he wants from the he McLoud use that wide big body and go strong thats a big time offensive rebound putback Miami takes it use it or lose it timeout with 38 seconds before halftime sevenpoint lead for Miami they got one more possession to try to make that offensive glass in pregame today he was standing next to 611 Eddie lamin I looked at you and I said he makes lamin look small and believe me Eddie lamin is not small the only other person I think bigger as you take a look at Cleveland what a strong take from Matthew Cleveland Taco Fall is the only other human being that Ive seen in person that makes other guys look really really small but Cleveland continues his great play in this first half up to 15 points shot clock turned off 10 seconds left before halftime Davis kicks to the corner Carlos swings open look and Taylor drills it oh the three wi from Way Beyond half court some into contested jumpers Miami shooting 55 from the field they went on a big run at the end of the half thanks to seven of their last eight from the field it was tied 30 a piece with a few minutes to go Miami up six at the start of the second half Davis gets a great look for Syracuse and up just like that the orange pulled it to within a possession thats a great set to start the second half Little Wheel cut they basically drag the whole defense down to lampin and then they get a nice little pin down wide openen jumper excellent execution to start the second half lamin and bell with 12 AP piece to lead Syracuse we talked about Clevelands 15 leads the way for all scores Syracuse got a three right before the first half buzzer they got another three on the first possession of this second half and theyve quickly taken a ninepoint deficit down to three but this wont fall from JJ Starling UGA chuku the true freshman point guard gives way to another true freshman in Betha Cleveland darts all the way to the cup its swiped away but a whistle comes in on Syracuse and its on Lucas Taylor his second and that time Taylor opened up too much again Cleveland a righthanded driver he basically forced him to his right hand again watch the close out you got to get on his right try to force him back left or play him straight up and again you dont want to close out and give a guy a drive driving lane in particular to his strong hand nearly half of the points from Matthew Cleveland six straight games at at least 20 win over 1500 career points on Saturday against Louisville and Bill Courtney and staff have done a nice job you know again they talked about his leadership they said hes really been the guy to step up and take on that leadership roll and great Twan game in transition and it finishes with a flush from lampin they may need to check the rim my goodness Eddie lampin bringing the Thunder my and that is great execution in transition lampin doing a nice job running the floor and now hes got the defense against kid again right here the big fella give get it back and then take off the rim ball barely touched the ground thats great transition offense by Syracuse and Miami again in the first half uh they bothered Syracuse a few times with their full court pressure that time much better breaking the Press by Syracuse Cleveland Rises over the top with a shorter Taylor and he Music connects I mean sometimes theres just no answer for this yeah I mean again thats not bad defense but his length thats what intrigued the NBA Scouts hes a guy 65 66 very long athletic and he just shot over him UK with a steal hes got a three on two takes it himself wont hit and its Tapped Out by Syracuse ball stays on this end well ukuku has really impressed me again a guy they werent starting at the beginning season it was Nigel Pac obviously Miami without Nigel Pac so ukuku steps into the point guard roll hes done a nice job showing some flashes future bright for this young freshman point guard Bea another freshman with a really bright Music future the second guy to come out early uh before this game Jalil Betha again his work that hes put in I think the biggest thing hes played really under control tonight everything within the Music offense Starling with a nice crossover charges into the lane and B it in well we build this a matchup of two of the better guards in the ACC and they have not disappointed thats a tough move by JJ Starling kid thought about the midrange jumper now Betha Works off the screen uku spots up lamin snags the rebound for Syracuse thats a pretty good read by Betha uku not able to get the three but again nice decision that time by Jalil Bea dribble drive off the snake of the ball scream and then kick it out Taylor gets it into lampin double team comes over for Miami Starling got the defender to fly by all the way to the rack and hes fouled Starling grabs his wrist in hand but thats kind of like the hockey assist right there for Eddie lampin they doubled down look at that nice pass out of the double team and then great patience that time by JJ Starling and it was the landing right there but again thats I think if youre Syracuse you continue to feed that again give lampin a touch force Miami to double and then play out of the double team it it just feels like every possession that Syracuse has done that where theyve gotten a touch for lampin on the post hes either scoring the ball or hes kicking out getting Shooters open whether the shots go down is one story or another but good things happen when lamkins get touches yeah absolutely and hes been good out of the double team I think thats the key thing hes not holding it too long hes seeing it coming and then hes getting rid of the ball so guys can make plays off of that Starling hits both free throws hes got Syracuse back within four they get chuko isolates on that right side coach utra yelling at JJ Starling to push the ball he wants more transition lamin muscles it up way short kid carals the rebounds that was better that time by Kid pushing him a little further away from the basket Bea and theres a whistle against Syracuse it goes against Kyle cuff Music and red ay having a conversation about whether or not that was on the floor but I like what Bea did right there again dont settle for a pullup jumper try to force the action get yourself through the free throw line and hes played a really nice under contr control game today again the talent thats never been a question for him and Bill Courtney and staff really have worked with him watching film in particular on the defensive side they said thats really the area of where hes been challenged and hes gotten better over the last few weeks on the defensive side well hes already got 12 tonight his career high as 17 cuff leaves it for lamin kick out Starling drills the three good things happen when Eddie lanin touches the ball again he is being unselfish with the ball beautiful offense roll see the double team come early and then give it Music up Cleveland got the defender up draws a whistle Matthew Cleveland going to the free throw line out of the time athlete a guy that can play multiple positions one of the better defenders in college basketball but his offensive production and his ability to knock down threes I think that makes him a really attractive guy to play at the next level in the NBA a very efficient 19 points tonight for Matthew Cleveland on just eight shot attempts and thats the games first Miss free throw Miami was eight of eight to that point Syracuse was 10 for 10 of course we talk about his great you know we Jinx him and he misses both all right oh my goodness is on us I think well I I tell you Miami impressive what theyve been able to do uh offensively uh but defensively this has been a problem for them controlling Eddie lampin uh he has been unselfish hes giving up the ball thats another assist for Eddie lampin Ive been so impressed with his passing yes he can score in the post but his passing out of double teams before they get there really has been of the key in this game Bea does not have the answer four assists for the big man lamin and Syracuse who started two of 10 from three has now hit four consecutive good pass but it slips through the hands of Davis Cleveland threw it out of bounds looking for Betha they were not on the same page yeah Betha wanted that one thrown up thats a missed opportunity if he throws that lob Bea definitely goes and gets it again not on the same page and better transition defense that time by Syracuse to break up what looked like it was going to be a lob dunk or layup thats what coach arrey said has been the biggest source of trouble for them recently is the transition defense they have been not been getting back and getting stops Starling gets cut off to shoot Bells been great Off the Bench but lost the handle and a jump ball its 310 of a second on the shot clock but it wont matter the possession arrow gives it to Miami thats great help defense uguk will again the Freshman little things like that playing The Gap get in knows the shot clocks down doesnt foul it comes up with a jump ball possession in Miami and Miami led by as many as nine right before halftime cuse has stormed back thanks to the threepoint shooting to tide at 52 Bea lost the handle Syracuse has a threeonone cuff all the way to the basket and thats Syracuses first lead since it was six to five thats tough by cuff through contact Cleveland right to the basket ties it right back up Cleveland seventh straight game that Matthew Cleveland has gone over 20 points not sure anybody else is playing as good as Matthew Cleveland uh in the ACC you talked about it thats now six games over 20 Music Kad has a oneonone inside against Davis skips to the corner Cleveland darts down the Baseline ball was whisked away but he reather kid floats it in Miamis back in front oh if on Miami excuse me Syracuse put lampin like youve been doing but another turn over UGA chuku throws it down Applause Music Im going to say it again future very bright for this freshman point guard I talked about his defense in the Gap another steal a 60 run must touch the ball on every offensive possession but when hes in the game Run your offense to him and then make plays from there 147 four tonight for Eddie lamin and weve said it over and over again anytime lamin gets a touch in the post good things happen for Music Syracuse Syracuse took a lead momentarily but its a six run for Miami to put the Hurricanes up four and Matthew Cleveland with the steel backto back possessions with a turnover for Syracuse Cleveland whips it back kid backing down spins to the left hand left it short well the other thing we have not talked about Syracuse without Donnie Freeman again their talented freshman he provided spacing yes rebounding the ball 13 points per game but also he was a very good shooter so again that provided spacing in particular paired up with lampin teams really couldnt double from the four lamin muscles it but missed the dunk wow everything but the Finish beautiful spin move and just unable to complete the dunk but again thats a break if youre Miami great pass from Cleveland underneath but Johnson shot was blocked from behind by oric Chris Bell hangs in hits thats great offense in transition Chris Bell matching the athleticism of Cleveland going right at him 14 on an efficient five of six off the bench for Chris Bell tonight UGA chuku spits it out to the corner open look for three rims out cant ask for a better look chance to tie or even take the lead on this trip for Syracuse Movic kicks out Carlos hits the three and the orange are in front well The Bigs passing that time my staric with the pass out of the post and Carlos knocks down a huge three to put Syracuse up a quick 0 spurt out of the timeout for Syracuse Joe Bay no rather State McCrae hesitation Carlos great bounce into Applause lampin timeout Miami on a 70 run for Syracuse transition offense right here the big my storage out of the double kept Miami out of transition and then theyve gotten back out in transition and gotten some easy opportunities if youre Miami you got to start getting back to paint touches and then go from there theyve uh been unable to break down this Syracuse defense over the last three minute stretch Joe Bay ties it up right away and just as simple as that right there again dribble drive by Cleveland get to the paint collapse the defense kick it out thats a great response by Miami Hurricanes had missed three of their last four threes but that one ties it up Starling cannot give Syracuse the lead back and kid carral the rebound Betha Works off the screen gets in the lane against lampin and he draws a whistle coach ay beside himself he said lamin was standing straight up the whole time and lets see if he was shifting again he had his hand straight up but well see whether or not uh he was moving lets see yeah hes still shifting now again hes moving right there if he stands still then I think hes fine but he was shifting a little bit definitely had his hand straight up but again ref in great position that time saw him moving and I think that was a pretty easy call for the refs its just the second on lampin so big man is not in foul trouble whatsoever true freshman but Thea is up to 14 points now just three shy of his career high and he puts Miami up a field goal let see where St Syracuse counters theyre wanting to get it into lampin shot clock dips to five Starling oneonone against kid all the way to the cup cant flip it in rebound tapped around Miami comes away with it Kanes out and running and Clevelands the last to touch it Syracuse ball thats a missed opportunity right there they basically had a fouron one just an errant pass and Cleveland unable to come down with Music it still have not been able to get into lamp in the last two possessions and that pass sails way over the head of Applause bell under eight minutes to play weve got a great one in of this game for Syracuse staying above that cut line to make the ACC tournament and Miami has really played well on both ends both teams its been a wellplayed game and let see how they close this one out Cleveland Rises for three swirls in game high 24 for Matthew Cleveland whos averaging more than 25 a game the last seven thats just a breakdown again a dribble Drive Cleveland has been hot cannot overh help and give him a wideopen look Syracuse finally gets a touch for lamin and again Malcolm good things happen when he gets a touch its either a buck hit or assist and again another nice pass that time out of the double team by lampin little soft lob pass Five assists for the big man to go along with 16 points and eight rebounds Bea deep three got it well when we spoke with head coach Bill Courtney about the X Factor he said Jalil Betha you asked is there a guy that needs to get going uh that kind of that X Factor guy and he did not hesitate he has answered I think one of his best games if not his best game in a Miami uniform Carlos rattles in the three for Syracuse to pull it back to a one score game and Adrien ay takes a 30 second timeout and theyve all been within the flow of the offense in half court or getting out in transition and to me look you know what Matthew Cleveland brings but I think patha really has been of the difference in this game the offensive boost that he has given them big reason why theyre up three yeah his 17 tonight match a career high 24 from Cleveland who scored over 20 and seven straight games now Joe B attacks oneonone against movich who had great defense great job that time sliding his feet and then getting the block without fouling Syracuse has led for less than a minute tonight down by three 545 to play lamin lobs to movich and there is a foul on the floor against Miami Jalil Bea and fortunate Miami right there that the foul was called because yeah again right here bethia trying to grab his arm down and that was a clear layup if the foul is not going the foul is not called so again a break for Miami right there and only the second team foul against the hurricanes Music too Starling darts into the lane squeezes between two no lamin Second Chance wont go either and its a whistle against Miami foul against AJ State McCrae his third lampin continues to crash the glass we talked about it leads the ACC an offensive rebounds per game close to four offensive rebounds per game its another double double for him too 10th of the Season 16 and 10 as well as six assists for lampin Bell his three Applause blocked bethus swings joob B spots up and buries Applause it well you can see the progression in Jalil beias game earlier on he may have tried to force it simple play dribble Drive kick Bell cant get the bounce on the layup here come the canes again Cleveland transition three offline offensive rebound chs got by straight for Applause Music Applause Music Applause Miami right now Syracuse 0 for four on their last for offensive possessions five to shoot Carlos step back contested two Springs out but Thea up ahead passes intercepted thats JJ Starling who comes flying in now he flies down the court takes the contact plus one in transition but one of the best in the ACC JJ Starling right here take the hit eyes on the rim the entire time body control and one thats a big time finish by one of the better guards in the ACC JJ Starling and thats a big bucket to stop this run by Miami fourth foul against AJ State McCrae sends JJ Starling to the line a chance to make this a fivepoint game with just over four four to Applause go 16 in the game for Applause Starling great defense from Carlos he slaps it out of bounds it does stay with Miami Carlos has been solid both ends defensively right there pressuring the ball hes hit some big shot shots made some nice assists if youre Bea right here again you got to be careful with the ball its a foul against Carlos body Music foul fivepoint game with less than four to go we got a great finish here in Coral Gables get 24 Malcolm a lot of leading scores on a team can do that but for me its the eight for 11 from the field its the efficiency that he does it with yeah really again right now putting on his show for these NBA Scouts and attendance AJ State McCrae backing down Starling tend to shoot spins Baseline re gathers puts it Applause in and thats just isolation right there again they like that matchup thought he had a clear size advantage on startling let him go to work on the Block a hand check is called against Lynn kid I like what Syracuse is doing though they continue to put lampin in ball screens and then dive him hard to the basket Miami has countered though again theyve just packed the lane in and theyve avoided allowing those postentry passes uh when lampin Dives down to the post theyve really been taking him away in this second half again here you go you see two bodies on or around Music him Starling spin down the lane floats it up too strong and the rebound tapped to Cleveland pretty good look but for Starling just unable to hit that short a little floater oh great defense from Carlos hes got the steal oneonone against Bea takes the contact didnt get a whistle Miami has numbers but wisely they bring it out content to take some time off the clock with less than three to go and up three Music possessions Cleveland Falling Away got it thats a tough shot from Matthew Cleveland and thats a set play again theyre just trying to get Cleveland isolated on the post clearly uh they like that matchup and they just went right at it let Cleveland post up Lam can gets a touch deep in the post got it plus a quick timeout from Adrien ay and its a full time out with 216 to play right weve seen a pretty good game both teams executing at a high level offensively Syracuse now after the timeout picking up full court still a sevenpoint lead for Miami this pressure has caused a little bit of trouble for Miami but they easily break the press this time Miami opened ACC play 0 and 10 but the hurricanes have a chance to make it two wins in their last three games shot clocks at five Cleveland Blows By lampin easy laying hes got 28 give credit to LY kid he cleared out that path uh for Matthew Cleveland Starling teardrop no put is there for Applause Music lampin there was a little bit of a delay there on Paul job came up limping a little bit but were right back to action foul against Syracuse and that is jquan Carlos if youre Miami right now you dont want to go to the corner if youre Jalil Betha you want to stay out of that corner right there you know Syracuse is trapping you do not want to go to the dead corner and then you have to a nice job these guys have been locked in we said it when we walked into shoot around uh again theyre a team that has uh really been focused the energy was there see if they can close this one out against Syracuse kid tied up in the corner against three Defenders finally gets rid of it but the got a twoon one but Thea Glide to the cup count it well he was a highly recruited kid coming out the coaching staff talked about his talent never in doubt right here beautiful press breaker and Jalil Betha and one thats a big time finish through contact his eyes never left a rim concentration on point and this has been his best game as a Miami Hurricane wont hit the free throw but it is a new career high 19 for Bea Starling with the reverse wont go but the tap in from lampin Joe Bay trouble getting it in and theres a foul on Syracuse that is Kyle cuff whos called for the foul one and one coming up for Miami after cuffs fourth foul and he had him there cuff though definitely had it looked from this Vantage Point had his right arm hooked around the waist of Cleveland they were close to getting a 5sec call right there Matthew Cleveland shooting the one and one hes six of eight at the line Music Cleveland now with 29 Points efficient you talked about it his efficiency 10 to 13 now 8 of 10 from the free throw line five assists hes done a little bit of everything in his third 30point game in the last seven games he has been on an real tear in the last few weeks Adrien ay just said score quick to his guys so Starling gets downhill lays it in that was quick he is one of the fastest guys inline to endline once he gets downhill wow the true freshman point guard Yuga choku stepped on the Baseline Miami turns it over and immediately offense to defense get lampin this is a great trap right here by storic doing a nice job coming up with the turnover again the Trap was there it was tight Starling way short on the three barely Graz the Rim it is saved into Starling goes right at The Rim draws a whistle and with 507 seconds to go Starling goes the line a chance to cut this to a twoscore game great time management right here and game situations again 507 seconds left thats an eternity in basketball the way theyre playing it right now Syracuse doing a great job offense to defense substitutions and the key thing is they full court pressure uh theyre bringing the Trap and theyre not allowing the Miami players to dribble or pass out of the Trap again Im going to say it again if youre Miami you cannot catch the ball in the dead Corner try to catch it up a little bit higher but when you go down to that Baseline in the corner thats a difficult situation and place to pass out of starlings got 20 hes five of five the line and its a fivepoint game movich checks back in like you talked about hes been the one thats been at the head of that press forcing the traps Applause Music fullcourtclassics a lot of body again he got the ball on top but definitely the body thats a heads up play though by Miami again my Syracuse faceu guard and you got to be careful if youre Syracuse you got to have somebody back but you cant face guard all four guys without a safety Cleveland hits both hes got 32 thats a new career high for the senior sevenpoint game starling right down the lane and hes fouled by Jo and thats heads up Play Again by Starling no need for a three now again if it comes off a dribble Drive kick thats fine but 399 seconds left still plenty of time to go for a quick two and then set up your Music defense Starling does hit the first two possession game with 399 to go Starling has equally been impressive in this Applause Music game rattles out on the free throw he goes one of two but theia has got the rebound and a foul against Applause Carlos four fouls against Carlos sends Betha to the line with 38 seconds to play in a sixpoint lead Matt Cleveland Matthew Cleveland we gave him the MVP and rightfully so 32 points in this game but for me the X Factor has been this guy at the line the Freshman Jalil Bea he has been impressive 20 points now in this game four assists and I think the biggest thing is hes been very uh unselfish with the ball again making plays for his teammate know he can score now three three throws now his first 20point game of his career puts Miami back in front Applause eight Bell quick three rattles in and out State McCrae flies in for the rebound and Miami did not need to do that and Betha immediately looked at his bench and said my bad theyll learn from that but thats one again you dont need it let him fou you Starling maneuvering through the lane he draws another whistle goes to the free throw line again thats not a good foul by kids you want to contest but you certainly do not want to put them on the free throw line and give them a chance to set up their defense Applause Starling now 22 points in this Applause game make it 23 with the second free throw two possession game again with 183 to go they get it in state McCrae and that pass was intercepted but a foul comes in right before it against Lucas and that is a break Chris Bell read that perfectly out of the double team came up with a steal but the foul was called beforehand again thats very a lucky break for Miami yeah right there again fortunate cuz Bell was coming for the steel Music State McCrae misses the first it is double bonus so he gets one more and its a big free throw to try to make it a threescore game yeah this one is huge right here 168 if your Syracuse you definitely now need a three does hit the second sevenpoint game Starling can fly he gets into the lane hangs doesnt hit got his own Miss and the put back I dont know that twos do a whole lot of good right now Malcolm and now the key thing for Miami inbound the ball if your Syracuse dont get beat long again they faked it get it in state McCrae and theres a foul thats against JJ Starling so free throws coming up for AJ State and McCrae with Miami up five 71 to go its the safe play but Cleveland again had a clear shot down a deep and again if youre State McCrae you got to get that ball up near your chin thats just too loose out away from your body get that into your body first free throw Falls sixpoint lead for Bill Courtney and his team who are just 71 seconds away from two wins in their last three games after starting AC CC play 0 and 10 sevenpoint lead Starling kicks Taylor spots up for a corner three rims out Bell the offensive rebound putb wont go and Miami wins it 91 to 84 over Syracuse impressive win by Miami
