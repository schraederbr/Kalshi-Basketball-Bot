Trey Johnson from Dallas Texas has not disappointed hes a number five overall Prospect in the ESPN 100 he was a McDonalds allam and what a start for him leading the SEC in scoring with 21 points a game he said three 20po games hes been in double figures every single game so far this season and he already broke Kevin Durants record for freshman points in a debut so good luck living up to that huh ready to go in State and Texas for the late tip here in Raleigh and tip is controlled by 6 and one Texas playing its first true Road game of the season both of these teams will definitely get up and down the court uh smallish in nature but athletic Jordan P the starting point guard for Texas two and a half assists a game puts up the 15th footer and drills it heres a look at the starters for NC State they had a not so good trip to San Diego lost by double digits to the first two power teams they face remember Michael oconnell from his heroics through the ACC tournament on the way to the final four in Phoenix last year and an early foul on Arthur Kuma and something interesting tonight of Ben Middlebrooks in the starting lineup so theyve gone bigger than theyve been most of the season of course Ben middle Brooks the long with okono two key parts of that great run a year ago 610 senor giving him some more size and size Brandon Huntley Hatfield also in there for State shot clock at single digits and its stolen away the lums had a couple of stops cron in Kansas State Texas bu what a jam oh my good shoton The Freshman from the Raptors what a start we we were so impressed with him today just getting the chance to visit with him Dallas Texas has produced some great great players over the last uh recent years heres Michael lonell with the pullup this is a midrange NC State team and then a foul on the rebound will go against the pack Tre Johnson can do a lot including this yeah watch this the sea Parts the Red Sea so to speak right down the lane hes a great outside shooter terrific shot Creator and you saw a little bit of that high level athleticism in my in my mind Tommy one of the four or five best freshman in the country preseason third Team all SEC debut season for the Longhorns and they push it again and get a whistle and count it and speaking to SEC former Arkansas Razer back Shaman Mark with the bat with the basket hes in the starting lineup now that hes healthy Mark battled of ankle injury early in the season didnt play the first four games started his college career playing at Houston and went on a final four run with the Cougars in 21 Mark limited action hes four seven from the free throw line this year ANC stayed over the weekend to your point about the competition Purdue BYU really struggled to make shots score easily and right now off to that same similar start they were shooting 50 from the floor in the first five games against BYU they shot a seasonal of 37 that was the last time out for this wol pack team Hill downhill off balance and pulled down by Tran Mark starting this game for Texas similar to the SEC starting the challenge SEC won the first nine games before Clemson pulled off an upset of Kentucky late last night thats a one two for Trey Johnson in an early timeout used by Kevin ke its a N9 nothing start on the road for the long WS Music Music Applause Music Music but Trey Johnson with an early impact to this game hes got four of the Longhorns nine what do you like about him FR he is an absolute gym rat when you talk to the Texas folks and Ive been around those guys a long time they compare his work ethic to Kevin Durant Kevin was in the gym constantly this young man two to three workouts a day he loves ball his dad was a terrific college player and man was he impressive today just talking to him really sharp young guy yeah hes got a maturity about him that belies his Youth and inexperience Jaden Taylor with a shake and now the three and couldnt find the rim but a foul will go on this side against Texas and Tron Mar its interesting talking with Rodney Terry about the plan for Trey Johnson he went to link Academy in Southwest Missouri last year and Rodney told him he said I want you to think of Link Academy as your freshman year and when you come to Austin this is going to be your rookie year in the NBA its the first bucket for state from Marcus Hill and then when you get to the league you already got a year under your bre how about that side well link Academy as you know you play the imgs the mon BS its a high high level of high school basketball mostly High major players and really get you ready for the power conference level Kuma working on middle Brooks very physical outside the lane and then he spins free and the rebound ends up in the hands of Michael oconnell good work hes going to get a basket here and easy on the other end for Brandon hyfield Michael okell the Stanford transfer remember he was a huge Catalyst last year on that run to the final four tremendous point guard at the buzzer beater against UVA in the ACCC tournament semis he had a great game against Duke in the elite eight where he had 11 rebounds from his point guard position hes a leader again this year Corner three good for Jordan po how about that great pass by Trey Johnson out of a double team crosscourt and then the n one pass by Kuma Texas has made five of six from the floor interesting talking about the maturation of that W team last year good feed inside able to thread the KN on Hunley hats got another and it was tied into the evolution of Michael Kell came over from Stanford it took him a little while as it does a lot of transfers to find his voice and Leadership within the team yeah no question and I I did a little research hes 19 and 10 as a Wolfpack starter in a little over a year theres with the scoop only the second Miss from the floor for the Longhorns in the first four minutes Hill gets cut off TR to go Baseline on Mark and Mark forced him into a bad shot I guess thats how you play defense when you start your career at Houston huh yeah no question about it now how about the offense jaman Mark has six early quick quick start by Texas and there are sizzling where is NC State at its best in the half quarter I think pick and roll with okano but the problem is Texas has a game plan for that theyre going to try to trap the ball out of his hands and of course getting it inside the hle Hatfield wouldnt hurt either Jaden Taylor cut off shot clock at four Taylor deed up by the Freshman Johnson and it goes home Jaden Taylors First B well thats a tough shot its not a shot Id want to live on all night if I were Kevin ke but give Jaden Taylor right there they credit he earned that basket andc stus heated up pack has hit four of its last five great shot F hes got a great shot F but he didnt bring the ball with him three on one for MC State Taylor collects and draws the foul on Trey Johnson 15 to8 Texas in the burn orange red hot early that hard gra Military Academy which has produced about 10 NBA players Through The Years David West probably the best among them but I was going to guess a million it seems like everybody went through there I think the the fascinating run about that season for Kevin Keats in North Carolina state number one he was on the hot seat before they went on that run okay so thats probably most important um big picture but also think about the royalty that they knocked off they one of six ACC programs that own a national championship in their program history they beat the other five Carolina Louisville Syracuse Duke UVA I mean you youre able to knock those teams off on your way through the ACC tournament and then in the Ina tournament and this fan base was so hungry to get behind a winner boy was that delivered and knocked off Duke in the lead a to get to the final four get S Phoenix Phoenix Phoenix thats right lot of lot of pack pans down there Michael Connell has assisted on three of the first four buckets for MC State heres Trey Parker hes a talented freshman almost travel coughs it up and Tra Mark has it blocked Big Time swap by Styles push ahead for NC State when they run they really pile up the points they were just severely limited in that San Diego trip over two games only 13 fast break Applause points whistle it inside but the Freshman Trey Johnson got his hands on it only 6 seconds left on the shot clock for the wolb Brandon Huntley Hatfield has been well traveled started his career at Tennessee playing for Rick Barnes in a couple years at Louisville did not go well for their team 12 and 52 I believe and this is uh a year to maybe make some amends well he was a rebounding machine last year for Louisville fifth in the ACC in scoring and well share some time at the five spot with Middlebrooks who checks back in but three on the shot clock Parker off the front of the room M Brooks keeps it alive heres okon and rebound pulled down with one hand by Arthur Kuma Julian Larry is running a point hes one of nine Indiana state sycamores that transferred out after the Magnificent season that they had last year I spent a lot of time with that Sycamore team in the NIT and this guy grew on me Julian Larry from Frisco Texas four years in terot a high school quarterback and I mentioned Marvin Mims today yeah Denver Broncos Oklahoma Sooner he was that was his Target when Julian quarterback well Mims would make a lot of quarterbacks look good mix me and you look good NC state has riddled the way back into this thing after Texas got off to a nine nothing start Longhorns havent scored in two and a half Music minutes middle Brooks got double k kicks it out shot clock at five another extra pass styles for three and MC state has Clos that Gap in a hurry they need Dante styles to play at a high level the former Carolina Tar Hill then Georgetown back home in the state Here Comes State pack hasnt LED yet tonight or look down hard no whistle Texas the other Applause way now Longhorns catching their breath in you on a N9 nothing run Kuma in and out and a fantastic rebound and a put back up and in by Kendall Weaver what an effort he is a a this is his second year hes a transfer from Texas Arlington he is an Energizer Bunny 17713 NC State with a nice run but Weavers bucket has life for Texas again Auburn in the last three weeks they are both NCAA title worthy Alabamas got so much depth little floater is good for bre out pass by the way Auburn and Duke playing right now a surprise for the Auburn and Alabama teams last night Im told that when each team returned to their hotel from the respective shoots they were surprised to show up at the same hotel as the other so the rivals its the iron bowl of hotels they show up and theyre sharing the same space fighting for conference room space thats right both both of those teams are absolutely outstanding H out ji BR in his starts of the Season great look bucket for Tommy were going to be in Columbia Miss for Kansas missou this kid Julian Larry hes reminds me of dwan Harris he just dont worry about the stats he just makes winning plays good example right there well hes got 108 career starts under his belt I dont know how many dwan has at the moment but Ill tell you Sunday but no substitute for experience Baseline jumper for D Styles this interesting style for n state theyre very much a twopoint shooting team Texas locks down two shooting team yeah exactly and thats why NC States got to get up up and down the court and get out and transition another feed for Kaden Shedrick hes got backto back buckets for the Raleigh native who played his high school ball just down the roads Road at Holly Springs High School got a few family members here tonight weve been told yeah in fact that Holly Springs boys basketball team was supposed to show up for this one he had to scramble to get enough tickets out for all all of his family friends touch for Middlebrooks and theres the double good kick out of there late in the clock Taylor for three off the back rim another fresh 30 another offensive rebound for MC State yeah really good Hustle by Styles thats what they need indeed yeah they were looking for that all weekend out in San Diego and Coach Kei told us that the transfer from Georgetown has to get going if theyre going to be the type of team that uh he thinks he could mold them into being Kingston native started his career play for the Tar Heels best player to ever come out of Kinston J stri house yeah CED Maxwell forget about me and dont forget Charles Shackleford who played here at NC State about Reggie B Mark get S backwards here comes in C state state has never LED Hill high off the window and we got a tie game at 21 and they throwing that for cour press up as well it 221 and she state has made four five look back back in this game both teams have had many runs Texas scored the first nine points in this game and Kevin Keats was forced to take an early timeout Weaver over Middlebrooks and a hand check will be the second personal of Ben Middlebrooks yeah lets take a look now its State starting to heat up a little bit watch Styles hard drive to the basket by shedric nicely done and then Marcus Hill the B the bowling green falcon transfer averaged about 20 last year in the mac and both of those guys coming off really tough weekends as Kevin Keat said we need those guys to step up and so far they have time from the free throw line Kendall weever got another one coming Junior from Ireland Texas was the whack freshman of the year a couple years ago at Texas Arlington hes an outstanding Defender and at 62 averaging six rebounds a game is that what Texas is going to be their kind of team that has to have their guards get some boards yeah this is not an overly talented Texas team in terms of some of the teams weve watched through the years and uh its going to definitely be rebounding by Committee shedric in fact is really the one big guy thats in the rotation Shedrick battling inside with Huntley Hatfield there comes the double back out to pass and a save on the Baseline by The Freshman Trey Johnson NC State had a unicorn in the post last year a point Center that could distribute unlike anybody Kennedy downhill a probably Kendall Weaver and he throws down the duck hes got five well great find by Julian Larry on the Baseline these two guys are two really good team players high energy good Defenders move the ball and a beautiful reverse and Inc State battling Marcus Hills got six nicely done went off the opposite foot shot Walkers kind of looking like its like a knuckle ball trying to find it they gave Bing green better than 20 points a game last year Trey Johnson had couple buckets early hes been quiet since one of the top freshman in the country mismatch and he fires over the top ped down by Applause Taylor andc State still searching for its first lead of the game Taylor splits him and MC state is in front for the first time timeout Texas something to get on their feet for here in Raleigh in she state in front by one he was three for 12 as you can see he also went 0 for seven from Applause three and State throwing that little two21 press out there whats the goal with the 221 well against teams in the nonconference you try to turn them over but youre playing team like Texas slow the game down and melt the shot clock and a drive ends up in a whistle with Jaden Taylor tied up Arthur Kuma you know Ive been watching Arthur play at kraton at Kansas State and now this year in his first year at Texas and this is the most efficient he has been and for this Texas team because of their lack of size hes basically their fourman even though hes a 66 guard hard great shot fake good around the basket and hes judicious this year shooting the three ball Kuma 71 from the line got one more coming the second annual SEC ACC challenge continues Thursday both SL the top 25 womens Hoops including number 18 old M here against NC State thats on ESPN 2 and7 Eastern our double header has number four Texas taken on number 10 Notre Dame followed by number eight Duke and ring in Champs South Carolina duks increased scoring from 68 points the game last year to 83 this year Carol aons team is tur it up on the offensive end Michael conell gives it up Dennis Parker junr cut off back to oconnell floater nope itll be out of bounds with theong to Texas little Ed Nick Cody in the ball game now for Rodney Terry 610 freshman out of Dallas Texas and then a mistake made by Jordan Pope stepped over the in line and so Texas gives it right back ronys Terrys team does not turn the ball over fourth in the country few than nine turnovers a game thats their second tonight hotley Hatfield jump up Applause heres Weaver and the Reb back comes down to NC State this is where theyve got to push it trying to get some easy ones get downhill theyve done well at getting to the rim tonight pull up tough shot wow Marcus Hill you know hes listed at 64 what do you got him at H 62 Bly green had him at 64 I dont know what they do out their H but obviously a terrific score last year in the map and before that he was at Southern Union State youre forgiven if you dont know exactly where that is he was on the map cuz he led all of Junior College in scort its down there in the state of Applause Alabama Weaver cut off shot clock single digits heres Paloma oh what a strong move baited him in give up the Baseline very very patient this year picking his spots keeping that ball moving and that time he just overpowered the defender went to the elite eight with kraton Team the lost to San Diego sat Thriller hell TR to shake and now Dennis Parker off balance Kuma picks up his second lets go back and take a look at Marcus Hill nice little pull up right here in the lane and then Kuma just with the bully ball down low hes got a great shot fake he just muscles feel out of the way and correction the last foul was on Kendall Weaver and so Dennis Parker Junior got a couple coming his way softw out of Richmond Virginia John Marshall High School he was a consensus for recruit Weaver takes a seat they got Trey Parker they got Dennis Parker Jr my favorite Christmas song sung by Ray Parker J no relation play any Parker Brothers board games growing up a b all for two from the line only is third and fourth ATT touch from line this Applause season Johnsons dad started his C Baylor and that one turned away as he went on the drive off of him and back to MC State there thought that Trey was going to end up at Baylor well Dad played at Baylor and finished at Newton Midwestern State uh probably came down to those two but dont forget BJ hcom goes to Bor didnt play tonight by the way hamstring and Trey so each of those instate schools got a terrific young PR both are going to be the NBA draft 17 in the McDonalds all am and bner three is gold for Marcus Hill only his third of the season and NC States up by a deuce at the 4minute Mark well that was a terrific terrific di by Michael oconnell left hand Applause crosscourt and a foul on the wing charg the Parker how about another assist for Michael oconnell yeah well done take a look Michael okell hes got the Stanford degree in his back pocket hell get the NBA in the spring and he puts that ball right on the money nicely done Music okay yeah they also got a football game coming up this weekend I think the Texas fans are dialed in on making their trip to Atlanta as well rematch kin Durant was at the first one heres Trey Johnson with the fadea away good hes got that mve down pack hes got great footwork fundamentally sound obviously highly skilled and they went right to him out of the timeout it tells you something yeah no not enough on that con has it turned away in state with a turnover state has given up the lead as Trey Johnson goes back to back out of the timeout hes good man he is really impressive and give Julian Larry Credit in fact I watched Texas this year they all defer to the Freshman which says a lot when you think of how many older players are on this Texas team they they love playing with Trey Johnson Huntley Hatfield and Parker with an extra pass wide open Corner three and ell is shooting almost 40 of the Season left it short look at that speed by Larry that time he turned it over he was hoping shedric would have been watching but heres a guy to watch all season TR Johnson watch this guy man he has got that fade away good defense right there cant do anything about that and watch this pull up it is an incredible year for freshman in college basketball hes certainly hes in my top six he was named Mr basketball in Texas any he went played a year in Missouri he was the Missouri player of the year Applause here heres okell they got looks from that corner and it was funny I asked Rodney Terry Texas is number one in the country in twoo percentage defense at 38 I said hey is this a byproduct of the schedule is it you know defensive philosophy is it about your roster makeup or a little bit of everything he said well weve also given up some threes if you get up from three two numbers going to look better against us and if you take away the two and youre Youre vulnerable to the perimeter shot but I think its a combination of everything you mentioned an air ball as it fade away from inside the free throw line by the way that was Arthur Kumas second personal I feel like you mentioned Texas maybe not as talented as theyve been in years past if theyre going to find wins in the toughest league in the country in the SEC as you described it theyre going to have to come up with some great defensive efforts well well theyve always been you go back to Rick Barnes obviously certainly now Rodney Terry Chris beard Rodney knows about defense thats for sure but theyre going to have to be a gritty tough team and and this league look at this hand his hands get on the floor Taylor Dives after it Larry saves it shot clocks at 13 and Julian Larry trying to set up now guarded by oconnell got to get into the paint he will five on the clock three Larry launches from Straight Ahead couldnt find the rim what a defensive performance by North Carolina State on that effort and right on Q Jordan po back in for Oregon State Beaver saw him play as a freshman made my first trip to Coral to watch him nice college now it was honorable mention off conference as a freshman of Oregon State Applause traed one shade of orange for another both feeds it inside Keats wanted to walk instead itll be a foul in North Carolina state to the dismay of the NC State head coach and get styles for his first then they showed a replay and I think he did was he tripped over Styless foot and I think Styles would have a good argument here he just steps on styles of FO so Kevin Keats got a pretty good argument and puts zerich on Y at the free throw Applause line and he sends it too far ball dont Li with the sa I dont know invisible turnover that thats what we call it Huntley Hatfield guarded by shedric hes musling his way inside but Way Off the Mark and the putback from mconnell draws a whistle first on Jordan Pope and I think if NC State is to reach their potential this year in conference Hunley Hatfield has to have a really really good season hes the only inside scorer although as we seen tonight Tommy we mentioned a number of times their guards are great at getting into the pain and getting those twopoint baskets so heres lonell at the free throw line whos second in the country and assist seven and a half per game a big match up Saturday night youre done watching college football switch over to ESPN two 10 Eastern number four ranked Kentucky coming off its first loss the Mark poar goes on the road to Seattle to take on number seven Gonzaga you and I going to have time watch that game Saturday night you see up that late oh yeah its 900 Columbia time thats get an hour back well be uh well be ready to see Kansas number one in the country take on a Missouri team which had a great comeback last night down 16 at the half to C yeah they gave up a 17 nothing run at the end of the half and The Scorch the Nets in the second in the tzo Martin cup 5 Seconds the shot clock and conell got away and gets whistle for the foul whistle is going against NC State yeah and I like that they went inside to one mismatch but as soon as Johnson gave it up to the wing he still had hle Hatfield on him throw it right back to him and let him ISO to big guy we call that a boomerang pass but they still got a mismatch inside with Applause Shedrick so Kaden shed H the free throw line and the rebound belongs to the long one great effort and saved by Johnson 40 seconds to go in the half heres pop po nope and the rebound yank down by Marcus Hill 5sec Difference game clock and shot Applause clock probably thinking High pick and roll right here with a point guard that really sees the floor and the loose ball out of bounds in front of the Texas bench therell be 10 seconds left on the shot clock State hadnt made a field goal in nearly four minutes now both teams have gone cold late every now and then when you get into this situation late in the clock I wouldnt even ball screen give it to him 28 got to go make a play he count two on the clock rejected over to the Texas bench half second left on the clock and itll be a corner inbounds chance for a catch and shoot but very difficult spot right here you dont usually practice an inbounds in the Deep Corner get turn around another block and that will be a shot clock violation and now Texas has just over 4 seconds what do you like here well weve said it for a million years if you get a clean catch you have four dribbles to go Coast to Coast you look at the clock you dont even look at it after you look get it once and then youre going to catch it and get four dribbles but you got to catch it heading towards the basket lets see if we got it here throw it back didnt get it back to him cleanly and Texas will not get a shot off to close the half NC State scoreless over the last 412 Texas scoreless over the last 322 and as we hit the half its a twopoint lead for Texas that the AC that the SEC has put on them over the last last 244 hours you know big picture that could certainly hurt the ACC throughout the course of the Season you lose value in in wins and get hurt more in losses I think thats putting it really simply but just as far as NC State is concerned to try and get back to the NCAA tournament theyre running out of opportunities in the not conference to find signatur quality wins this they do they momentum they do have one more opportunity I think if you want to count on winning at F Island Fieldhouse that might be on December 14th youre right and Texas is a team I believe will be in the picture for an NCAA bid you know its only four power conferences this year so those Pack 12 uh participants in the NCA tournament you know this is a conference that could get 10 or 11 teams in you would have thought that that would have opened up more space for ACC teams but Bracketology not kind to the ACC heres a nugget I heard today from Gary Parish Vanderbilt is the lowest rated SEC team according to kingom theyre in the low 70s there are 10 ACC teams behind Vander crazy crazy its over half the league its Marcus Hill whos got a game High 13 and we tied at 33 Marcus Hill like Styles was uh Missing an action in San Diego over the weekend good to see him getting it going a little bit and a Texas turnover Ken shed couldnt ell had a rare turnover in the first half Aver is one turnover every 50 minutes Taylor no those are the kind of shots that NC States got to make and not a great threepoint shooting team now two of eight from deep in this one turn around Trey Johnson Middle Brooks got his hands on it got looking after battling inside and then theyve moved it to the Elbow a wrestling match with Huntley Hadfield and shedric when they choose to engage shot clock at 10 swing it should get that ball moving a little bit St worked on at the shooter on today whenever the double comes on the postley hfield here comes the double came late Aon for three wide open another missed open three these are good looks great pass by Hunley Hatfield did exactly what he should have done off the double team kick it to the opposite side and got to make some of those got to make the defense pay tough Wednesday for Michael lonnell 0 for seven from the floor po knocks it down second three of the night for Jordan PP you mentioned started his career at Oregon State hes an Oakland kid tough as they come two good years under Wayne tinkle out there wanted to change his scenery and uh Texas opened up their arms to the transfer one of 20 on the Bob Koozie award watch list for the countrys best point guard ah stolen away by Tran Mark after the double and the two Hand flush and Texas has opened up a fivepoint lead thats like a quarterback throwing into coverage right there we talked about Hunley hfield getting rid of it looking weak side and that time Shaman Mar read the pass went right through the passing Lane we should start calling those jamus jamus just cant stop hes turned to a higher power to try and stop throwing six middle books drills the three this is second of the season and Inc State finds some momentum from the big get the crowd going a little bit its a late night here at Raleigh shedric turns it over take a look right now so Mark sees that hes been looking opposite Hunley Hatfield runs right through the passing Lane for the pick two starts last year for Eric mman at Arkansas he led to Razer backs in Applause scoring those an interesting collection of talent and a second turnover tonight for ok Kuma here comes in State the other way three onone hutley Hadfield took a bump and gets a bucket and a go to the line for the Applause Lead watch the big fella run 100 of your donation goes directly to cancer research and Jimmy V of course his greatest accomplishments took place right here at NC State got to see Ernie Meers before the game Ernie was on that 83 team one of the great High school players to ever come out of New York and I said to Ernie what was your connection to V he said my high school coach was coached by Roco valano but that V connection was uh incredible down here on Tobacco Road and for everything he did well here at LC state that Legacy continues Johnson pull up three whoa Its guy is going to be a lot of fun to watch this year he sure is thats an NBA 3 right there probably a little further hes just so cool calm and Collective when I watched him in October I thought he was a little too cool for school and then I stayed after the practice and he was out there for an hour working up a sweat with the assistant coaches and as I mentioned earlier theyve probably not had a gym rat like him since a guy named Kevin Durant shot clock is late for NC State Taylor got some space y Dave Taylors got a I think what what strikes me watching Trey Johnson hes not hyper athletic but he just has such a great feel for the game I think youre exactly right hes not the explosive athlete that you know you would think of hes a basketball player with great skill look at this WOW follow from shedric results in a foul against nor Carolina State see who gets charge for that one going to go on Huntley Outfield is first Tommy when I watch Trey John Ive seen him a lot in high school and of course watch practice hes still upset with himself but those first two plays he made tonight the Breakaway dunk and the step back free if youre an NBA Scout you could pretty much close the notebook and say okay I Ive seen enough hes been in double figures all eight of his college games heres Kaden shedric at the free throw line there you see him talking to North Carolina native from Burlington Frank ha former head coach at Tulsa and University of Missouri those coaching shirts look like they got them at a bad golf golf pro shop sale like the Christmas after Christmas sale look you got an end of season discount on those stripes nothing nothing against burnt orange now its just the style of those shirts heres Parker with nine on the shot clock and Hunley atfield got rid of it before the double got there two on the shot clock to go dont see it a thats not Bens fault thats Marcus Hills got to have a shot clock in his head right there once Marcus got into the pain he needed to be aware of that clock you always got to have it in your head as you get under 10 you know in the NBA they play with a 24 second clock and once youve been in the league a couple years its you dont even need a shot clock to look at you kind of know Marcus right there need to get that ball up on the glass and shes taking to go a little bit smaller with Styles coming in at the four conell returns and its stolen away into the hands of Marcus Hill and state has made its last three the team that didnt shoot the ball well over its previous two games they have picked it up tonight and a foul inside shont Mark is going to get whistle for his third hand fighting with Brandon Huntley hanfield good job by the wolf pack they saw the mismatch and they went tried to get it into the big fella and he picked up that third foul thats going to bring Kendall Weaver Applause back Hatfield going to work and here comes Texas the other way PP into a three in transition follow wasnt there and its St comes out with it at their fast when they push it just like this get downhill 22 fast break points a game second best in the country beautiful pass to Huntley hfield and one for number one and MC stayed back in front excellent execution when you drive it Baseline the big guy on the opposite block just ser go to the top of that restricted Arc watch right here Michael okell knows right where Hunley Hatfields going to be and the big fella finishes it off I I i got to tell you now we all know what Michael oconnell did a year ago that great Run Middle Brooks and DJ Burns and Horn Etc this kids a tremendous point guard and they dont have the scoring around him this year that they did last year but you can tell What A Difference Maker he is with the balls in his hands he didnt even get into the starting lineup last year until late January and its things started to turn for MC state but remember a four game losing streak going into the ACC tournament before they came and turned it up nine straight wins guard Jordan Applause po little Spain action right here thats what we call it pick the Picker Johnson nice came out of nowhere Arthurs having a really really good Music season Hill working on Weaver a its tough angle Arthur Kuma comes out of nowhere 66 shot gets up on the rim and nobody gets a piece of him on the back side and hes really the deao power forward this year physical enough to definitely handle that rooll shot like a five heres pass B shake off balance bodys on the floor and the rebound comes down to Weaver Kuma On The Run shot out of Cannon and one of the reasons he got shot out of the Canon is cuz Kendall Weaver at 62 is all over the glass when he rebounds it then he can play like a guard in the open court you just follow his lead Styles working on Kuma Texass for state with some tough shots yeah hes not going to get by Kuma Music Hill 11 in the first half and fouled by Weaver we head to the free throw line twopoint Texas lead big match up Saturday night Gibson and this guy in a long line of those uh terrific players whove gone on to play in the NBA and got their start on the 40 acres youll be in the 40 at the 40 acres a lot this year yeah I think so hope so yeah fun by the way KD made it uh I dont know if hes going to be in Atlanta this weekend but he made it to uh Austin for the first Texas Georgia game Got a Feeling hell be busy somewhere this weekend well you know the report came out today chams was talking about that hes at one to two weeks with an ankle suffer last night he might he might be in the but he brought all of his Sun starters with him flew in after an open practice at Arizona State and he was pretty excited to show off with Booker and all those other guys and say this is how we do it in 40 acres and he was down on the sideline for that game it was all Georgia Georgia shut him out in the first half you know what I love about that they couldnt get him tickets in the stands or at least it would have been difficult Im sure they could have got him tickets but they said well just put him down on the field nothing wrong with that down Royal stadium great place whats it hold now 150000 well they they keep winning it will yeah Taylor Sho at six okell okell is swarmed gives it up with one on the shot clock Styles in the double figures Styles hit right behind okon as that shot clock went went down its fun man its two teams battling they both need a win and state has lost its last two Texas comes in on a six game game win streak after dropping its opener mid Brooks digging for it itll be Texas basketball second to the sh yeah lets go back and watch Michael oconnell trying to make a play so style circles right behind him and Kuma gets stuck behind falls asleep and nicely done shedric returns 9 seconds on the shot clock for Texas Applause heres Trey Johnson watch him now hes got great footwork hes getting a shot with the Dig gives it to his man and its rejected but middle Brooks is whistled for what will be his third personal foul well Ill tell you why lets take a peek officials had a good view it looked like all ball right here I think its all ball remember hand hand is part of the ball and I think Ben Middlebrooks got all ball right there I know his uncle Danny canel former Florida State quarterback whos got to be up early cuz I listen to him every morning probably didnt like that call Ill be talking about tomorrow speaking of football ABC college football conference championship lineup includes two lane going to West Point to take on number 24 Army Iowa State in Arizona safe for the Dr Pepper Pig 12 title Georgia and Texas in Atlanta and it is with Clemson andu when you think about the cach football playoff from a March Madness Bracketology standpoint Clemson sitting there as a bid Thief could be and the B the bid theyll take is probably roll tied if uh theyre able to knock off SMU by the way SMU should be in barring a 45 49 nothing loss I dont see how SMU is not in but certainly Alabama back in Tuscaloosa hoping for a uh Clemson win right yeah they want SMU to win thats right BR Clem yeah Clemson loses Hs got another one coming that fouls on Weaver his third I listen every morning to Dusty theek and Danny canel great college football stuff every now and then they sprinkle it in college basketball rebounded by Kuma all right this is exactly the kind of game that we expected very evenly matched by the way one of the few thats been close in this challenge the SEC has won by blowout in just about every game including Mississippi State in pit right now in starville Bulldogs all over the Panthers Johnson Tred to shake turn around bucket and wh before he walked with it still a big time shot by the freshman lets watch right here officials had a good look at it theres the pivot foot he lifted it up its good call they dont call that one at the next level though probably not proba not they probably going to get away with that one going to be an outstanding young professional player in time hes just got great uh demeanor and what I call countenance just plays the game at his Pace styles for three oh theyve been missing this third three of the night for dant Styles last year he shot 37 at Georgetown and Kevin Keats would take that all year long Larry behind the screen from shedric got four guys on one side of the floor shots at six Larry finally gives it up p for three he used every bit of the rim well somebody wasnt a word on the backside because once he went Baseline the only people on the court in burnt orange were on the opposite side of the floor they just let uh they just let Larry make a play season High three threes for dant tril Styles tonight here hes getting a Applause touch in state using every bit of the clock Taylor with contact will draw a foul lets go back and watch D Styles had a very good junior year at Georgetown catch and shoot letting it Fly knocking it down and they watch this drive here by Larry see all the white jerseys in the lane once that guy drives Baseline somebodys got to be rotating out to that weak side corner let me last foul is on Trey Johnson is second middle Brooks playing in foul trouble hes a really good passer okell puts it up off the window yeah when you make that crosscore pass it becomes a long close out and it gives a driver like gonell room to get by the defender really nicely done Inside Out basketball Larry with the shake and rejected by middle Brooks we got a great one here tonight in Ry NC State is flexing on Texas playing to a threepoint lead late second half Music yeah I think so they need more from Hunter Dickinson had a bat night tonight was Kansass 105th alltime game as number one against an unranked opponent just the third time in their history that they F have suffered a double digit loss in that scenario in the first since Kansas State in the Rivalry game in 11 wow but everybody loses in Omaha yons lost here does great Villanova teams lost there pop Isaacs dropped 27 tonight one of my personal favorites Johnson cut off tough shot yeah good defense contre Styles at 66 gave no Applause space got to be careful here the freshmans going to foul and he did he let him get away with the first bump and B Smith said no not twice good call so thats the third on Trey Johnson you sit him here no they might sit him for a minute but dont not for long yeah now hes got three kind of come down a crunch time you know you saw it coming because he got away with the first bump at link Academy you play an IMG that aint a foul sorry hell learn oh big Miss big Miss only 64 from the line got to try to put this uh long on team away when you can at the foul line cant give away points NE team a shot the ball well from the free throw line tonight good head fake B back to Mark come on Mark been limited due to foul trouble this evening and he able to get it in over the top of the rim leading score for Arkansas last year not for long limited nice hang in the air good ball movement on that Applause possession you know this is not a knock but this feels like a first four game in the NCA tournament I and I dont mean that negatively I think both of these teams have a chance to play and March in the tournament Styles off the window yeah I like the way hes mixed the three ball with the drive early in the game he got to the rim hes catching and shooting at three hes got a game high of Music 15 long HS will reset Larry looking Kuma mismatch with oconnell got a muscle L and got tied up and then theyre going to reach yeah I I thought see what I like about this is Michael O conell reached in with two hands like he was going to grab the ball you usually dont get a call for a foul on that play Lets watch I thought if anything it was going to be middle books yeah and I I just think when you reach in with two hands it doesnt look like a foul and Im not sure it was instead its the second on okono just a little over six minutes to Applause go PO for eight on the shot clock never gave it up and then get a foul in state in the second on Styles yeah dantz walked underneath shed while shedric was jumping good effort only a fourth or 15 Music six minutes to play and Trey Johnson will return for Texas does just to settle him down give him a quick blow going theyll go a little bit bigger with Johnson and Mark on the floor at the same Applause time Kuma head fake gets him nowhere reverse pivot gets him nowhere thats good D and then the step through Spin and he checks down his own Miss up the Kum marked for three rebound to Kuma and a whistle against Inc State Kevin ke is near midcourt he is apoplectic at the wh his teams getting tonight well I love that Kuma stay with it styles on the first part of it he did not jump for any of the shot faks and watch Arthur track it down and then hes going to crash the glass right here and he got reached in a foul on pass thats the easiest call of the night its the first on pass I think I think Styless going to get a quick blow here because hes done a great Applause job Johnson going to work the D Taylor ties him up its out of bounds off with freshman back to MC state theyve locked in on the Freshman for sure and that a senior versus freshman right there no question watch Taylor now hes not going to you know what you do in that situation you take your nose and you put it on the offensive players belly button P the belly button cant fake you out so you just stay on his belly button and thats exactly what Taylor Applause did dishes into the Cor corner for three offensive board for Inc State heres Taylor working towards Middlebrooks gave him a screen its rejected at The Rim by shedric NC State thought it was go ending all burn orange the other way TR shots in transition we are tied at 55 on a Trey Johnson fre y miss the go shedric started this take a look Kate and shedric their best shot blocker the home own Raleigh guy on a family here and then at the other end this kid ice water doesnt matter how many hes missed he is going to take that Music shot were TI at 55 here 455 to go Cal Missouri last night like whats the connection oh yeah AC iss a challenge I thought I I was thinking it was the conzo Martin cup conzo back coaching in Missouri State yeah terrific guy coach to Tennessee cow little fake pressure right here by Texas how do you see the final five minutes of this one you know uh obviously this games been very closely played the teams are very evenly matched I got a feeling Texas is going to make one or two more plays I I just got that feeling Texas is not in the bonus yet next foul will be and he stayed much much better tonight than they were over the weekend contest a twoo jumper and it was ell fighting for it it goes off to Texas its interesting watching ncate theyre really good running right their fast break points are second best in the country but when they dont run its like an NBA team they use the entire clock when they dont run puts a lot of pressure on execution late yeah I mean theyve got a great point guard that can handle the ball right down to the end of the clock hotley Hatfield blind jump hook turned away by shedric and you know Kumas got his 13th rebound hes been Rock Solid tonight with a good effort on the road hes one bucket away from a double double lost by Texas Trey Johnson out front Hill but thats Marcus Hill converts on the break at Marcus Hill the Bowling Green transfer from Bowling Green Ohio take a look steel at the other end average 20 last year hes getting that number tonight hes got 16 Music Music all right we got a tight one here with n state only lead by two speaking of Duke and Cooper flag Frans got him number two on your list of best freshman who else has stood out to you so far well I mean uh Dylan Harper I saw him in Las Vegas he took my breath away Ace Bailey his teammate two ruers kids now thats not the mock draft cuz Im not smart enough to figure out what teams are drafting yet okay right Im not Im not that good other people are but I think Dylan Harper has played the best of any freshman in the country right now Im certainly high on Cooper flag hes got a double double tonight over in Durham 15 miles away this kids top five in my opinion but when you look at the Freshman Class Derek Queen Jeremiah Fier oh yeah I was going to throw fser two lost and hes given him 17 a gam absolutely Robert W from B Edge its a plethora of really good freshman nice P up shot Jordan P hes got 13 they have uh they have put a number of long horns in double figures tonight well good things come to those who wait we really only had one good game last night it was a sensational contest with Kentucky losing on the road to Clemson and then Duke and Auburn coming down to the wire and here a tight one with 317 to go on a turnover gives it right Applause back dont see that very often for Michael oono thats a rarity but hes had a hard time tonight hes had three turnovers go with seven assists he came in every one assist every 50 minutes and a push off on Jordan pop a personal foul and a turnover for Texas Bert Smith right on top of that call Ry Terry disagrees burs made that call about 10000 times the Applause extension Tex will score the first nine points in this game the Longhorns withstood an NC State rally and had a twopoint lead at the break middle Brooks he can pass it and and when the double came it turned into a foul and its another on the Freshman that is the fourth on Trey Johnson Ben has really mixed it up tonight cuz hes physical enough to get to the rim and obviously hes got that ability to find his teammates on the weak side and with 248 to go Trey looks over at Rodney Terry and says I got you coach and before that Rodney Terry looked down his bench and then I imagine he thought well I dont have anybody better than and he looked back out the Trey and said lets just be calm and dont commit another foul lot of Miss free throws on the front end for NC State tonight yeah thats going to be an Achilles heel if they dont win this game and a travel Trey Johnson took it and he is beside himself with some of these whistles going against him tonight lets watch hand off here comes the Freshman I think he took two and a half three steps I think that was a pretty good Applause call still Lo to 5712 turnovers tonight for Texas they came in fourth in the country less than nine turnovers a game okono these are critical these are Styles snow here some big ones in the first half yeah these are good looks somebodys going to make a shot or two to win this game both teams called on the offensive end heres Pope over okon rebound Trey Johnson tried to sneak it in left it short Guma finds another under two to play shot clock at 10 now lets see what the Freshman can do to shoot it over the top of the senior its a three for Trey Johnson hes got 18 you know what he did Tommy he didnt waste any time he didnt mess with the ball he created a little bit of separation and he just rose up and I told you earlier hes made about five or six plays tonight thats all I needed to see Middlebrooks kicks it into the corner Styles decides the drive its blocked and it goes and one coming three the hard way for dant styles that could have been two twice could have been that was going to be a go tending and it was go tended into the hoop take a look right here here watch shed now I think I think Lee Cassel is saying that the foul occurred before the shot well and keep this in mind too because it was a go tending call they can review this now if it did he call Goal tending or did he call foul cuz if its goal tending they can review this well you you cant assess a foul on the review you can only review the goal tending aspect in anyway well but not if right but you cant review a goal tending call unless you make a call thats right okay so lets see right here are they calling goal tending and the ball went in anyway so its going to be two points I did not see if there was a foul call I dont think theres a Applause foul new rule last two years you can go to the monitor to to review a basket interference goal tending if its not goal tending then we might have a point of interruption situation I think the baskets going to be good I think its going to be called goal tending its its a little odd its an odd play to go to the monitor because what is the end result either way well heres the point as soon as your goal tend it the clock stops so whether the ball goes in or not doesnt matter because if its a clean block right then its not gold ending then you go to point of interruption if theres no Applause possession I believe theyre probably looking at the clock if thats the case that they did indeed call goalen yeah cuz I dont see a foul here but whats what do we say a second and whether or not it went in this kind of game a second mean something you know and often times theyve made the call and theyre just trying to get the clock but they did blow the whistle and its apparent to me there was no foul call so if it was basket interference goal tending now if they dont think this was goal tending then its going to be point of interruption if theres no no Applause possession it was go tending and they went back to double check the clock so so see it didnt matter matter if the ball went in cuz once theres a call the play play dead yeah good piece of officiating so no foul on it it was just a whistle for gold sending and its a onepoint deficit for NC State with 120 to go yeah that clock is important man that second or two in this kind of game you got to get that right wheres the Freshman being guarded by Jaden Taylor watch this now Kuma hard drive off balance followed no but a foul Kendall weevers attempted put back with under a minute to go this kid is as energetic as any player you will see this season at 62 we mentioned it earlier hes averaging six rebounds a game hes going to come into your picture and hes going to get up on his pogo stick and almost puts that ball back in now hes not a great foul shooter this 47 on the year all right the foul by the way was on Hill his second one or two from the line for Weaver twopoint Texas lead under a minute to play and a timeout taken by Kevin Keats across midcourt 543 left anded regulation back to Raleigh in half a minute andison Scott shes old miss one of her of their best players ever all SEC a year ago she played some USA 3on three for us so Ive seen Madison operate that should be a good matchup here with West mois Club West mois teams already lost to two really good teams LSU in South Carolina a number of really good teams on the mens side like you you know Houston has lost three games on the final possession and I think theyre going to be really good but heartbreaking losses to Alabama Auburn San Diego State well speaking of close losses this is an NC State team before their final four run it got hot they had seven games decided by five points or less that they went 0 and seven and Kevin Keith saying you know I really felt like every we got up to a good start last year we had those malays in the middle of the Season we just couldnt finish those close games obviously they did once they got to the ACC tournament well see if they can here and the officials have gone back to the Monitor and double check and I assume the clock now the question here last year they could throw it into DJ Burns who was basically their their point Empire State Building thats what he seemed like out there its going to be interesting the balls going to be in OK connells hands but whos going to end up taking this next Applause shot heres Jaden Taylor okon will come back up and get it hes turned it over three times in this game that is a monster number for him shot clock of 10 Hunley half field posting cut off shot clock of five Taylor needs to shoot it fade away over the freshman and its a loose ball that goes out of bounds off of Texas shot clock is off 29 seconds remain down two Jaden Taylor beat his man the first time either take it to the basket and get fouled or create space the first time not that second time with less time on the shot clock so theyll now go to the Monitor and review the clock I believe not going to look at possession theyre going to make sure that was indeed off of Texas on the Baseline exactly and meanwhile Inc State and Kevin Keats can steal a timeout here to draw a perfect Baseline out of bounds plate assuming that theyll retain possession heres a look at it lets take a look right here looks like it went off shedric last it was a bit of a reach by Huntley Hatfield his right hand got in there towards the tail Applause end lets watch it again Tommy I I see shedric here tell me what you think certainly shedric First Watch the right hand oh is it also shedric last thats what I saw thats what I saw but well well find out yeah good job tonight so so what do he drw here there is 20 seconds left on the shot clock you know whats whats relevant here is not only to get a shot when youre down to try to get a chance at an offensive rebound or two so you cant hold very long you got to get something going quickly Styles has been one of the best scorers so is Hill number three and white and a turnover again he turned it over once every 50 minutes and Michael Connell with four turnovers tonight well give Texas credit because they smelled out Style watch style see how well hes guarded Kumas been like underrated tonight defensively got a foul shot clock is off yeah got to give one okell gives his third now this is a one and one Longhorns just seven of 13 from the free throw line tonight what an uncommon game for Michael oconnell well this guy at the foul line coming into tonight was pretty accurate eight of nine first free throw attempt tonight short in his State hands Jaden Taylor has it 20 on the clock cant mess around get downhill you got it got got a time out time out on the D with 17 seconds left oh man thats a little bit unfortunate I thought Taylor you know weve been weve been urging him to go to the basket that time he did he looked like he had to step on his Defender but Kevin Keats in the last two minutes if the coach can call timeout when the ball is live and he decided to call time out so the inbound will be at the hash in front of the C State bench with 172 you mentioned this a moment ago but Ill go back to it how quickly do you want to get a shot off if youre Inc State down to as quick as possible just get it in bounce cleanly which they didnt do that last time get it to whoever you think can get downhill and then you drive it try to get fouled try to score at The Rim maybe a kick out three for the wind if its a good look theyre not a good shooting team but they cannot mess around and then what you got to do is you send everybody to the offensive class right here and as we know Bob mck Bob mckill the great coach Davidson taught us this many many years ago you tip it out look for the three off the offensive rebound we call it a a dagger three Rodney Terry right now on the other hand is saying no threes no open threes well go to overtime the other thing you want to do here in your Texas defensively throw your hands back on Drive show the officials that youre not reaching in and make NC State hit a tough layup at the rip Texass twopoint defense has been really good tonight in fact their overall defense theyve held NC State to 45 shooting Ill tell you kavuma has done a terrific job defensively tonight Kendall Weaver out there hes going to bother oconnell hes a great Applause defender okell gets it 16 now Weaver all over 12 picks up his dribble 10 go Taylor down two downhill puff fake no whistle doesnt get the shot off cleanly and Texas is going to escape Raleigh with a win and an exclamation Jam from Kendall Applause Weaver tayor did the right thing it looked like shedric stayed vertical and thatll do it another W for the SEC Texas comes away with a fourpoint victory and a little drama and maybe just a hair controversy on that last possession well you know what lets watch it you know good job by Taylor somebody was reaching in I dont know if there was enough contact here he goes good D no thats good defense what tayor tried to jump into shedric shedric held his ground Johnson was not near him he didnt foul its a very good defensive play by the young man that grew up 20 minutes from here Holly Springs K Kaden Shedrick well what a finish in a tightly contested game
