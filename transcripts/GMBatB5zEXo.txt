series 221 and James Scott ready to jump against Cameron corhan AJ decide throws it up along with Tommy morisy Kip Kissinger and away we go from The Ville the Cardinals have the tip tied for second with Clemson coming into today in the league and the Cardinal Javon Hadley over to heer and Scott Smith Edwards that is an incredible starting five as Chucky heer gets fouled on off his own Miss not a very deep loable team but a dynamite starting five and already I mean the offensive glass has been a real problem for pit I mean Jeff cable has talked first of all about their defensive stamina guarding for the full 30 seconds and then finishing those possessions with a rebound they are giving up 12 points a game on Second Chances and its just really its put a ton of pressure on their defense and that first meeting tier Point Louisville had 22 Second Chance points plus 12 on the glass and heper who had a 17 free throw attempt game a week ago goes two for two heres a starting five for pit pat Kelce said is Leed and Jaya low are as talented as any back fort in the league Austin a great three and D guy Coran and Diaz Graham and its Austin who gets free inside for the stuff nice to get a dunk and nice to get somebody other than low or legged to get your first points of the game neither team very deep of course the injury to Damen done for pit out for the season with a fractured elbow Louisville had all kinds of injuries heurn into the paint again hes got the first four because of how Louisville shoots it and they put four guys out there who could take threes take and make threes the gravity that creates gives you great spacing and it opens up those drives and all four of those guys around James Scott can put it on the deck theres Coran legot will take a three that rainbow is well short and the Louis bench celebrating as they were all shoot Applause around Edwards will roll it up the floor for Louisville a cardinal team its picked ninth in the ACC theyre going to finish somewhere in the top three Hadley off the cut the Colorado transfer whos been so good of late cant score with the left and eventually low really got be hugg by his teammate Coran emerges knocked Away by Scott great hands for the wble big and he turns it right back over low from leget inside Coran with a flush Coran nice drop off there Coran you know the two bigs trying to play guard and and handle Scot in the open floor led to the turnover basketball Louisville turns it over second straight time with a hipper and lob you know its the priority defensively today for Louisville is youve got to control Jaylen low particularly out of ball screens he is so Dynamic getting downhill getting into that paint P Kelsey C maybe the fastest player we see all year is that pass way too strong from Austin both teams sloppy well it was a 9 0 am shoot around today and it feels like everybody in the Louisville program had about six shots of espresso beforehand it was Rowdy it was energetic it was authentic that is the Pat Kelsey way told us I dont know any other way but to have our managers and gas bring more energy than any other managers and gas in the country coming over from the College of Charleston his team tied with Michigan the largest win to win improvement from a season ago Wolverines Court also with the new head coach and Dusty May heres Diaz grab from low another Miss three rebound to Scott and low particularly loves going left youve got to try to shade him to get him going to his right hand hes a completely different player going right low gets caught up with Edwards here trying to defend him Edwards off the ground the riv and down again its the spacing and then the versatility of teren Edwards and Javon Hadley they are so good on the drive penetrating and they can play that bully ball like Edwards just did right there use their bodies Austin two strong out a three heres rain Smith Louisvilles best threepoint shooter will pull up and feed Edwards Edwards giv space and he Applause bares and theyll pop a three in your face and thats what Im saying theyve had three different guys go for 30 this year and ter Terence Edwards has come close to doing that at 27 against Miami couple of weeks ago heer of the first four Edwards the next five low tried to squeeze it in between Scott Edwards Edwards Smith Hatley and he was way Above the Rim but knocked it out of bounds great energy though great start for these Louisville Cardinals at home a 94 lead against Applause pit good step and that that Daman Dunn injury really affected them you know they his defense his ability to score hes a veteran presence a fifth year guy so not having him has put a a lot more pressure on Jaylen low and ish Leed to have to score and then theyre kind of hoping somebody else gives them production trying to find breaks has been hard for those two as leg hits the first pit three of the game is leget 35 threepoint shooter and hes gone to another level is legged you know hes hes even playing better in the last four than he has all season 20 a game fourlegged in those fours season average 16 12 lows at 167 heres Smith with a very deep three no good trayor bubacar trayor couldnt throw it off of Coran and heres Leed in transition heer quickly down to get Coran Leed Austin nice swinging Austin cant convert on the three it will stay with pit you like the ball movement three early turnovers from pit one of the best things theyve done all year is take care of the ball but cant Corin caught it on the Block Applause there its a pit team that had a three turnover game earlier this season at Syracuse tied a School record low with him is three and heres heurn for Louisville R Smith seven threes in that first game against pit havent gotten him a clean look yet and trayor turns it over theres a third turnover for l j back Applause theing two teams that are pretty good taking care of the ball with a sloppy start Scott returns to replace Edwards for Louisville leg it lefthanded fine into Corin underneath to tie it cor is so active heper barreling his way in he draws a foul this is a really good pass but it starts with the energy from Corin now just playing off finding the front of the rim rolling down that that middle of the paint and a really good find what do you like about corens game and where are the next steps for him theres a bounce to him you know he he plays with a really good motor uh theres an offensive game thats developing you know he can play out of that short rle out of that pocket can hit a face up shot you know the one thing given his size and his energy you youd think hed be a little bit more of a better rebounder you know hes only averaging five rebounds a game like he should be up around eight nine rebounds a game given his physical and tangibles but I like him like I I think hes been a good fit spent two seasons at Florida State and you know how Leonard Hamilton plays I mean youre in the game youre out of the game youre only going to play about 20 minutes so hes playing a lot more minutes here at Applause pit last two games 32 points was 14 for 17 from the field hes two for two today Louisville back on top as heern gone four for four from the lines low for pit which is still yet to make a substitution low leaves it short cor ends in there Lows on the ground and it squirts out to heer Noah Waterman on the floor for the first time for Louisville 93 and heper finds him and Waterman DRS it Waterman thats all Chucky heer he comes barreling down in transition and then he just starts playing like Steve Nash in and out of the paint and then hes going to find the open shooter gets no Waterman up over a th000 career points and hes all over Diaz Graham here Scott nearly knocks it away hit deep in the shot clock deflected Again by Scott heres Smith look out knocked away to low just a lump in your throat moment if youre the opposing team and Smith gets a shot up Le it through the lane wild shot shot will not go down to Smith Waterman passes up to three This Time air mails a Applause two you like that pit is is playing at a slower Tempo I mean not even just slowing it after that exchange I think they wanted to come out and Force Louisville to defend shrink The Possession in this game low takes a heart Anthony finishes with the off hand fou Z first first Applause the theres a heper three moments ago the heper assist to set up the Waterman three so Chucky hemper with six points and an assist early but a great great finish by Jaylen low on this end second best free throw shooter in the ACC at Applause Music 88 L will take a seat for the first time before the 12minute media timeout freshman Brandon Cummings is Applause in pit with Papa amadu kante 610 picked from senagal in the game as well on the ball right Music now Hadleys really been working inside he gets it against Leed he spins and he misses punched out of the air by The Freshman Roots down to Applause Leed good has already turned it over four times Diaz grab for Applause three Edwards trying to bully his way in kante slips with the ball no travel Applause its a game in dire need of a whistle right now sloppy for both teams Louisville won for its last seven and leg it with another Miss for Pittsburgh heres Edwards scores what a start for Edwards game high seven for the James Madison transfer Cummings peer all over Cummings a freshman trying to get around him no Here Comes Waterman Edwards again and he wont finish this Applause time somehow we still have not hit the 12minute timeout and pit Will Rectify that by taking a timeout slowing this thing down a force is what makes him so tough Pat Kelce said that to to him the big story was how Terren up the level of his defense and how that set the tone for the rest of the team to raise their level 50e senior used to compete against Pat Kelce when James Madison was in the ca when Pat Kelce was in Charleston before James Madison moved to the Sun Belt heres low with a good look for three and he buries it and that and thats what Jeff capable will do willll get him off of the ball you just put him underneath the basket in a floppy action and he makes a really nice read comes off good shot fake as Defenders fly and he gets his he gets his space six points four rebounds and assist early for low up top too tall for Scott Edwards turns it over cuz Louisville with Jaylen low in ball screens theyre going to send two to the ball so how do you get low some shots well you take them off it and if we had gone back a little further they you know they start him underneath the rim and he kind of comes off on that floppy good shot fake as Defenders fly at him ninth in the ACC and scoring Jaylen low a lot of his points come from the line but he is capable from out there heres amsel delich leaves it well short pick goes deep into their bench Waterman for three Tapped Out by Scott to Smith only the second offensive rebound for Louisville so pit is held up well and the shot clock did not reset hey tonight NBA Saturday Prime Time on ABC and ESPN plus de Curry coming off 56 a couple of nights ago in Orlando here the Warriors are in Philly to take on Paul George in the Sixers 830 tip countdown starts at an 8 Eastern Warriors and the Sixers Golden States East Coast Road Trip Scott misses a Applause dunk one the leaders in field goal percentage in the country with a rare Applause Music Miss on the ball against corad Leed turning around on Smith rebound to Hadley Edwards transition again and over the outstretched arm of Austin heck of a move and if you dont stop the ball higher I mean hes going against a freshman in delich and Terrence Edwards eyes lit up youve got to stop the momentum higher half of Louisville 18 for Terren Edwards Jr Austin Delan for three and the rainbow goes just his 10 threepointer of the Applause year and then delich is called for the foul as he bumps Smith Jeff cable appreciating his teams effort fighting back to an 1818 TI Applause college game day is rolling you were mentioning their shoot around this morning I I always say you want to you want to know why a team is playing the way they are go watch them practice you want to know how a turnaround like this happens go watch the practice and you know you mentioned the energy I think any team winning team the energy is a given I think with Pat Kelce and his player its the communication both the verbal and the nonverbal like there was not one negative body language moment in that workout today they take the lead back R Smiths first three of the evening player who came over with Pat Kelce from the College of Charleston has just hit his 15th three of the Applause Year there just hasnt been a lot of room for jayen low to operate out of these Crossing actions these on ball screens and thats how teams are playing pit uh you know towards down the stretch of this season and they are just not going to let Jaylen low beat them off of the dribble low trigger the offense splits two and couldnt finish on the floater Coran has it knocked away well and there he got a little bit of AE of steam and then rain Smith came up lazy I mean youve got to come together if youre going to youre going to guard him with two but he shows you the burst that is his best Music Applause quality whop it into corm Frank Anam eBay in the game for the first time heurn on Leed five to shoot Leed step back and a foul called against Chucky heurn his first Music first its a nice little matchup there with uh Chucky heer Applause and yeah so right here I mean just two outstanding offensive player and legot and then Chucky heurn who is not only going to be first team all hes going to be in the accs all defensive team or should be I hes had that good of a year Applause two and a half steals a game for heer and then leg it with a rare pit Miss from the line its a pit team on Pace to be the best free throw shooting team in program history and leg it goes one for two Applause pepper lob for anula eBay Too Tall heres the burst from low he sets up the trailer leot Austin into the front row and lo just went crashing into a Applause fan I think is okay big smile on his face F almost took a charge is it still a charge under the new Block charge rule is the question pit keeps possession under six to play first half where they have tied it four times but have not LED leg it no Diaz Graham keeps it alive low squirted out to Diaz Graham deflected the leg it this a wild possession and it ends with a three you go from almost having a Pick Off by Chucky heurn then your defense is in rotation and pit does a nice job finding the open shooter first lead of the game GE Mo Diaz Graham 33 from out there Scott rolls it to heper in the Applause corner BR Kelsey told us theyd love to have Scott initiate its a 16th straight game with an assist the Louisville big man and the Cardinals back in front Music five to shoot it low for three too strong strong thats a win if youre Louisvilles defense you want jayen low taking those shots started two for six low leged 1 for seven Hadley spinning into low out of the double heurn for three got another ch Austin answers with a friendly Applause bounce peer thinking about another one make it three Applause Music a 15point first half for the all ACC maybe all americ Chucky heer low leans into a two and another answer for pin and thats the second time Chucky heer almost has a steal and it leads to points for pitch another one oh my goodness four for four for Chucky hipper Smith has yet to get going but hes gone for 30 this year Javon Hadley weve yet to call his name slow start for him but hes gone for 30 this year it puts so much pressure on the on the opponent each individual Defender has to be able to guard their matchup and you know the way they pass it the way they share it the way they space it because of that ability to make threes its just hard and so youve got to take up the challenge of your matchup and its you know they theyve just got the ability to explode on you but I agree with Coach pit has played hard to withstand that Onslaught from Chucky heurn and still only be down four you got to feel pretty good on the road if youre Jeff Capel some good answers from legot and low whove combined for 14 fourpoint game after Scott misses the free throws saw him playing with a mask because of a facial fracture suffered a couple of games Applause ago six to shoot its low typically has it at the end of the shot clock Diaz Graham no for three in the rebound Roots theyve gotten good looks opposite though pit has you know taking advantage of the the aggression of Louisvilles defense they have found Diaz gram a couple times opposite hes just got to knock that down Edwards rolling Edwards comes to a stop Watermans the outlet cut off heres heer again looking for another hes got five in a row CH career hyper threes is six one away in the first half Diaz gr thats a really tough pass peer on the handoff leans into it oh Applause my one minute willll be Chucky calls raining from the Raptor shortly low will answer Applause again Applause Roots low bursting down the court good step you know again pit continues to answer I mean this is an absolute onslaught time out by Chucky heurn and on a couple of these man theres not much you can do when a guy is feeling it he is feeling it Louisville takes a timeout were back at 30 to the Applause upsetter this is stupid Music man come Applause on all right the last three he hit was a bit of a prayer but this is one where once a guys hit four threes he has to dribble it Isle it because of that screen Noah Waterman coming up your your instinct is to back off a little bit and anticipate that screen this one you cant help but on that other one before if youre is legged he has got to dribble the basketball and you got to get him going to the Baseline Chucky heord six threepointers attempted six threepointers made hes tied to career high most points in a first half by an ACC player this year hes got 24 and Smith is fouled pit had a couple to give you know its remarkable played at Wisconsin last year so did AJ store AJ store has not had a good year this year for Kansas Chucky heurn has become he was good at Wisconsin hes become a new player here at Louis go Smith gets it to him at burn they dont foul him he misses the layup hits six threes misses one at The Rim Leed pulls up and nearly banked it in starts 39 heck of a back and forth fight heer with 24 the best half of his career but pit is hanging around a sixpoint Louisville lead after 20 minutes here at the ACC games to go after this and they begin the half with low for Diaz Graham a three rounded out hes had good looks when Jaylen low gets into that pain hes small I mean thats where he has a hard time finishing with length around him in there Hadley did not score in the first half he at 24 to match the jersey number Edwards nine rest of the team at six Edwards again and that shot will count theres a Applause first five minutes are important though you know again you you can feel like you played well in the first half if youre pit but this thing can get away from you quickly this this an important first five minutes here for pit so pit team its three and seven games decided by six points or fewer this year theyve had trouble in these close games theres low driving it in on Hatley and he draws his first foul thats where somebody else has to step up and make a shot for pit and thats where you know its easy to say well Jayla low hes got a green light his shot selection is spotty at times but hes coming from a good place like theres part of that dude that wants to win hes competitive and feels a burden to put this team on his back offensively ish legged had some moments in that first half hes got to get involved here and then one of these other dudes Zach Austin guo Diaz Graham one of these other dudes has to make a Applause shot low goes two for two you look at the the field goal and the threepoint percentages are not great but to you its its just a lot of somebodys got to shoot it for peny yeah its a volume and and hes not that type of a player Kevin Scott misses another stuff and then heers called for foul against Li Music Applause Music second hes the first player in the game with two so no foul trouble to speak of which is good news for these teams who are very short right now Music Applause low back from Austin its a coren screen Diaz Graham again bang thats the shot you know Jaya Los going to draw that attention Louisville is really in the gaps I mean they are not trying not to let load to the basket thats a shot that has to be hit High dribble by Edwards I hadly beg your pardon Here Comes Chucky and hes fouled there his leg gets first basketball youll see Jaylen low gets into the Gap here and look at Chucky heer I mean hes coming all the way off R Smith all the way in the paint they want you kicking to Diaz Graham because they dont think hes going to make that shot consistently threepoint numbers have gone quite a bit down from last years two for six today Edwards is fouled before the wraparound so no shot thats the other thing Kevin pit did a good job in the first half of keeping Louisville off the foul line in conference play Louisville has made 12 more free throws than their opponents have attempted theyve attempted almost 100 more free throws in their opponents this year I mean that is prolific part of it is their willingness to drive it and part of it is they dont foul on the defensive end cley pit defends without fouling there look speeding into the Lane out for Austin for the tie and no good Le there for the offensive rebound same spot Diaz gram he cant hit this time Edwards will drive him AET came down to help Edwards just flings it up there and weve got a foul and low is limping a little bit here across midcourt Music the line for the Cs number Edward and jayen Lows going to have to hop out of this game right on the foot of R Smith L will try to jog it off in the tunnel hes had a tremendous game with 14 and five so an already thin pit Team without done for the rest of the season has to turn to the Freshman Brandon Cummings very early in this second Music Applause half leg it Diaz Grant with a rare Drive pass Coran and steps before the shot no weve got Louisville thought it was a travel theres a foul Music Applause call its a really nice pass though by gamero Diaz Graham kind of gives a look to the corner and then feeds it to Corin and he did travel but I I guess they saw a foul before that tayori here with his first so Cummings initiated the offence freshman who did have a 30point game this year six a game and cor s fouled again if youre Jeff capable right now as right Smith gets the TR face where do you find offense without jayen low well I think ish leeds got to be the guy I mean hes averaging 16 a game you know the same amount as as jayen loow is problem is youve got really good individual Defenders on Louisville and theyve put multiple different guys on him now theyve got Terence Edward Jr the length on him Cummings trying to take it at heper a wild shot thats one way to get L involved well thats what scorers will do man you know theyre going to find their points and that was a great attack of the glass heurn passes up a three Smith heurn Edwards oh Austin from out of nowhere with a rejection he is so good at that he has 48 Now 49 49 blocks on the year and hes blocking a jump shooter there what a play the next closest guy on pit is Cam corn with 22 I mean hes just and its always coming off of the ball next block would make him 53s and 50 blocks is the only 5045 as Edwards muscles his way in and draws a foul Applause and thats the third on cam corad is actually Javon Hadley who took it there and yet to score in this game but thats what he and Terren Edwards Jr are so good at putting their head down and they are physical drivers Hadley Colorado transfer 12 and 1 half a game theres his first and good news for pit jayen loow is going to come back in hell replace Applause Coran adleys been in double figures 15 of the last 16 and theyre up by Ford despite him only scoring two tonight crowd back into it largest crowd at the yum better this season nearly 18500 load trying to take trayor Austin for three Austin its overh help I think coming off Austin that far but Jaylen low going left if you let him get left hes a different player Edwards answers let Louisville now 10 for 15 from three Edwards with 15 points trayor trying to force low right this time and hell dish it to Cummings Cummings a step back three its good and a foul Brandon Cummings a freshman out of Midland Pennsylvania has a chance to tie this at the line time is out dueling threes here Terrence Edwards Jr says youre going to give me that space Ill put one in your face and how about this and clock comings little handle little step back also in your face hes wet Music three Notre Dame college game days in South Bend Indiana that game noon on ESPN so both the Cardinal mens and womens teams will be dancing this year number 19 Louisville ranked in the top 25 for the first time in four years but getting everything they can handle from pit Brandon Cummings a chance to tie it with a potential fourpoint play by the way the officials looked at the goal tending earlier in that sequence K kri has told us the play stands as Cummings cannot tie the Applause gate whats impressed you Chris with the fight from pit this second half few other guys have stepped up I mean theyre getting open looks you know that was a tough shot by Brandon Cummings but they are playing off of that low penetration Scott is foul there have been more fouls in this half already than the first I mean theyve made pits made three threes and good play there by Zach Austin on the back end pits made three threes but you know the other thing Kevin we talked about it at the top they have really struggled to finish defensive possessions with a rebound theyve done a nice job keeping Louisville off of the offensive glass theyve competed you know I I think its its as simple as that this has been theres been more fight from pit today than maybe weve seen over the the last handful of games their last game a home loss to Georgia Tech on Tuesday as Scott is now 0 for four at the line today pit 4 10 in the last 14 after a great start to ACC play where they looked like an NCAA team a lot of work to do now this would be a heck of a way to start the stretch Applause run K Kissinger is explaining decision there to Noah Waterman and thats his Applause first yeah I dont know what Noah Watermans complaining about hes got a handful of shirt automatic first down low rims it out Austin rims it in and pits back in front first lead of the half first lead in a while for the Applause Panthers Scott looking to facilitate knocked Away by Diaz Graham Cummings between his legs and hell go to the Applause line really good play to poke it away by di Graham but how about Brandon Cummings The Freshman it doesnt always look pretty man but he plays hard and again he competes look at this little whoop back to front and you know crowd doesnt like it but when youre the aggressor when you go hard you are going to get that call nine out of 10 times its on heper its his third there final big Monday double header of the season is a big one number two du coasting awake forest team that has really had a tough week trying to play its way back out of the bubble then Kansas Houston Cougars already clinched the Big 12 for second straight year that starts at 7 Eastern on ESPN Monday night so that Chucky hurn foul is Big here Pac Kels got to take him Applause out heper and Scott off the floor Hadley and Smith return seven nothing pit run thats through the hands of Smith saved by roots Music Edwards wants a waterman screen Edwards driving four to shoot it Edwards pulls up too deep and L with the Applause rebound Jaylen loow taking the ear out of the ball a bit here with a seven nothing pit run step back three no good tipped out right to Smith who does not have numbers thats a settle by Jaylen low I think you got to try to test bra Smith that was not a settle by Edwards Hes got 17 what an atmosphere in Louisville tonight the Glory Days of Cardinal basketball are back leg it theres Edwards Waterman too strong well pit has has on these halfcourt possessions they are essentially just go on oneonone they are spreading the floor finding the matchup and attacking it l Burston and leg it gets fouled by Smith and a one and one for is legged coming up and I think if youre legged or low you have to know you always have that skip the defense is reacting they are plugging they are coming to help on those two guys in Applause particular and its big now that pit is in a bonus cuz again that thats even more incentive to put your head get the matchup you want put your head down and drop heers going to come back in and remember pit is a great pre pro shooting team 14th in the country 784 and Leed misses the front end of a one and one heurn back on the floor makes his presence known and the foul you got to love the move by Pat Kelce say look Im not messing around with this Im not keeping an all League player on my bench in a one possession game I trust him with the three fouls and pin has had a hard time stopping the ball in transition today thats bad defense by Jaylen low you have got to stop the ball and do more of an give more of an emphatic effort in doing that you just Olay you allow Chucky heurn to get right by you puts ton of pressure on the defense behind ards first missed free throw his first points of the half after 24 in the first 5150 Louisville the first game between these teams went right down to the wire will this one do the same man they had the roll Austin driving throws up a prayer out and we will take a break physical second half back and forth we go with blable up by Music Applause one we are Music Applause Music and theyre obviously right in this game 12 losses eight have been Quad One games five of those eight one or two possessions great look for Smith and he hits the three Pat Kelce loves running things for rain Smith out of timeouts to get a three really nice setup flare screen right there well they have gotten so many good looks out of breaks this year Louisville Diaz Applause gr this is first twopoint attempt of the game Diaz Graham lead back to two Edwards misses but is f heres this at a timeout just they they love this flare you know he gives it up you kind of relax for a second as a Defender you cannot relax with R Smith I mean his shooting hes as good as it gets nationally from the threepoint line you you did a lot of scouting back in your coaching days Pat Kelce out of timeouts out of breaks what makes him such a difficult coach to prepare for well the the players he has first of all cuz hes got a lot of dudes I I mean I say that seriously hes got a lot of guys he can draw stuff stuff up for but they run their stuff to to your point about Coach Kelsey they run their stuff with great pace and not all offenses do that but you know they they screen hard they come off hard and thats how you get Guys open and its nice to have a guy like Smith whos pretty pretty automatic from that threepoint line we saw them work on that exact Play Time and Again during shooter out today and they find the right moment for it and then Diaz Graham throws it off the back its still in bounds and now its Applause not the play was there corn was open you just got to be able to throw a laot pass Six turnover for pit pretty shorthanded team Edwards takes a seat after hitting the free throws heer driving hands It Off bobbled by Applause Hadley low gets on the deck Hadley shovels it to Smith its still with Louisville for to shoot its going to have to be Hadley or not yeah it should have been Hadley its a Applause violation another Scrappy defensive possession by pit Applause their numbers without Damen Dunn has done for the season similar offensively much worse defensively but they have fought hard without him tonight legan driving into the body of Smith he lost it you know they are trying to pick on that rain Smith matchup either is legged or low if they get rain Smith on him they are spreading the FL FL and trying to drive him theres got to be something there I mean there was a ton of contact its either a block or a charge I think the officials got to blow a whistle Applause there Scott get the score but he has three assist four Steals and now he turns it over low Austin and a foul is called Louisville fans an U they thought Scott had it cleanly but hes called for his second you know the ball security for Louisville has not been good here just an aggressive job coming through there by low and then a good decision to drop it back to the athlete behind you Austin 49 of 55 at the line this year calmly hits the Applause first two players with 45 blocks 45 threes in the country this season Zack Austin and big Z the other big Z VAV deich at Arkansas Austin had a very quiet game the first Louisville game hes got 12 today P burn and a foul is called against Coran on the drive thats his fourth you know that guard on Chucky heern has got to get over Chucky heers change of pace is as good as any any guard nationally I mean its its one of his strengths as a ball handler but pit is not the priority in a ball screen is is the ball and either Camp corins got to stay longer and level off Chucky heper so that his guard can get under there but a few times here in that high ball screen Chucky Hein had a head of steam downhill free to the basket and I think thats what Jason Cables talking to Camp corn about right now so 928 to go pits starting for man Coran is out of the game four fouls how long will they keep him on the bench peer with 28 low drives kicks for a three for lean missed it heer again Cummings lying in weight hes called for a blocking foul transition defense is getting away from pit a little bit here and Louisville feels it just ahead of steam again and he was there but the veran hebburn slides to the side and when its awkward like that the offense is always going to get the benefit of the Music down urn six for seven at the line today a week ago 177 free throws 17 for 19 against Florida State for Star Stories heord and Edwards 48 of the Louisville 59 low good day on the glass to go with his 14 make it his eighth rebound for Jaya low Diaz gram for three got his third for big make and thats the pick and pop James Scott just not not aware of his Personnel youve got to know you either got to switch that or hes got to get back with more of a sense of sense of urgency heres Kai Roots short tapped around to Cummings pits guards have done a nice job getting in there in defensive rebounding today plus two on the glass as a team and that Louisville foul is going to put pit in the double bonus the rest of the way his third Music 10 Jaylen low in his high pick and roll and just confusion from James Scott its a pick and pop Louisville does not want to switch that because they want to keep Chucky he on jayen low but James Scott you got to know who youre guarding and theres he just got spun around and he just got called for his third foul sending Diaz gr to the line where he could tie it Edwards backs bur Diaz Grahams hit some big shots in this second half their first meeting this year against Louisville P I lost that game by four Diaz Graham had no points one shot attempt in 10 minutes hes got a dozen in 29 minutes today big misses at the line though for pit 9 for 13 plus a couple of those misses were one and one front ends Applause still a onepoint Louisville lead Edward stripped Diaz Grant comes up with it gets fouled its a bad foul ball security has not been good for Louisville and then you foul a guy 90 ft from your basket should say Hadley with the foul by the way picks up his third so this was before Diaz grabs the free throw m a little kiss I mean in a postco world I dont know if kissing the ball is The Right Move do we have to then spray purel all over the ball before the next fre throw oh Kiss of Death these free throw the free throw line where pit has been exceptional this season has really let them down so far far in this second half and another Pittsburgh seal this is uncharacteristic sloppiness from Applause Lille Scott switches on to low low drives Scott low throws it over his head Austins there and he gives pit the lead a lot of that on Zack Austin staying disciplined and staying in that corner L low knew he was there hit by three on an answered prayer leing gets down and dirty its another Applause steal what do eight in a row for pit they have seven Ste he s in the game and five of those seven up come here in the second half Here Comes low got bumped no foul low wants it he better get back in the play Scott Great Scots and louiso will take a time out off the Scott stuff if jayen low gets to his left hand hes a stronger driver and he can also make a pass with his left how about that Harlem glob Trotter and then James Scott been aggressive I dont want to take away from their defense but some of these have just been cough UPS by by Louisville you know kind of lazy passes hit in the passing Lane in denial its a pit team that has seven wins this year in games they Trail at half time have come back from double digits four times they were down 10 in this game down at the half by six theyve got the lead with six and a half to Music go and an offensive foul is going to turn it over that will be our 8 Minute immediate timeout the last one was a Lille called timeout so you can go catch 2 minutes in Missouri Vandy and then come back there you go up 6261 pit pit just one and eight quad one this year theyve played their way off the bubble theyre not thinking about that now this could still be a really dangerous team down the stretch and they have fought hard to take a lead in Louisville Chucky heer itll be fouled and this could be a free throw fast down the stretch both teams in the double bonus ish leget picks up his second all right we had two quick timeouts so two long chances for huddles for Pat Kelce and Jeff capable what are the points of emphasis down the stretch well I think these possessions become magnified you know for pit out of the last timeout before we went to commercial break again you have a chance to draw up a play you end up getting a moving screen so you know Louisville comes away with points here out of their timeout well see what pit has drawn up but this comes down to taking care of the basketball and finishing defensive possessions with a rebound which pit has done well today there plus four turnovers heers got 31 one shy of a career hyp Diaz Graham he kept the pivot foot down low Austin deep one too deep Hepper in the rebound sprinting down the floor here comes Chucky he finds Smith off the fake he had a hand in his face Edwards does it missed Music it boy they get the ball up the floor in a hurry bit still without corad in the four fouls hes been out for 4 minutes now Leed trying to draw a foul on heurn Switched up with Scott and a three off the side of the rim did Edwards touch it no he did not its not a good shot at at some point I think youve got to get some sort of penetration cuz again like you said youre assuming its going to be a foul Fest down the stretch trip to the free throw line you know team youre in the double bonus make the defense have to defend you off of the dribble have you seen Louisville adjust to that or more pit being a little passive I I think pit is settling I think that was a settle for M Ley corang comes back in been out since the 928 Mark hes on Hadley right now but nobodys on Scott low lines up a three leg it got to it couldnt Coral it Chucky heurn is the magician I mean its not played well you dont stop Chucks ability to turn the corner and then there is no tag Defender coming over to help on that roll and what a pass two straight sorry Kev two straight threes backtoback possessions for pit neither were close and theyre now just 10 for 29 from three heurn starting fives out there for Louisville Hadley step back three down to low you got to play inside out those threes can come but they got to come off of penetration leg lost it heurn he lost it too and theres a foul Kip Kissinger comes in for the backside with a pit foul what a steal on the other end by Chucky heer watch him just reach around is legged fights over the top of that and then right from Applause behind comedy of errors here down down the end of it and Im not quite sure why that ends up a foul I I mean its legs third and heurn with 32 Louisville by the way 22 and0 when leading with five minutes to go this season and Pat Kelce said it this week we have closers weve got figured out guys they miss some some big free throws those Music closers Austin another good look really good look designed play you get him on a flare Jay la lo takes a ton of attention Austin was open pit has missed its last five going on four minutes without a point little rub from Smith heer drives it heer a new career high 34 low found leg it and Coran chases it down and then I think there was a whistle in there somewhere and a foul on rain Smith you can barely hear the whistle at this point but Louisvilles got a sixpoint lead the Cardinal closers trying to lock down a 17th win in their last 18 Music tyres proor Tuesday look like a bad injury at Miami they say its just to Bone bruise and they hope to have him back soon and Duke a game up on Louisville in the ACC Clemson is right there now a half game back these top three teams in the league theyll get the double b pits trying to spoil Louisville right here look theyre a great free throw shooting team but as youve noted there have been some bad misses well in this guy at the line is not this only 61 on the year for K foulers on rain Smith going to the break pure these are must make free throws Music and they made them both this is this is going to be a Chucky he bur high ball screen and pit has had a lot of trouble with this over the last 5 minutes a career high 34 the rest of his team combined has 34 leg get the primary Applause Music Defender theres a little rub from Smith he bir out for Edwards five to shoot it Edwards trying to create he Applause does they got a lot of guys who can beat you and a lot of guys who can create a shot at the end of a shot clock Edwards and heurn combined for 55 of the 70 low driving in on Scott and stoed by Scott and he knocked it off of Applause low low gets to his left hand but how about that from James Scott that drive from Terrence Edwards again just an individual play he goes and makes Edwards with 21 hurn 34 and wow a foul from the midport line will give heer a chance at 35 and 36 said it at the Top This is a team Chucky heurn Javon Hadley and Rain Smith have all gone for 30 at one point this year Terence Edwards Has Come Close so youve got four guys on your team who are all capable of going for 30 that type of Versatility is it puts a ton of pressure on the defense defense and and having to guard your individual matchup because each of those guys is an accomplished scorer and a heer a new career high he had 32 against West Virginia earlier in the year that was down in the Bahamas hes got 36 today low for three another Miss three Austin high points it last field goal for pit about 5 and 1 half minutes ago until now timeout Jeff capable on the low layup well step aside for 3 seconds pit down by six Applause Applause Music really tough finish by Jaylen low hes got 16 nine rebounds five assists if you are looking for Georgia Texas that game is over on ESPNU last team in versus this is the first team out of Joel lardys projected bracket right now the SEC but a big one here 207 to go Louisville inbounding up six pitch is picking up force a little time to come off the clock I would imagine again this they can get into it get Chucky heper with the ball and that high ball screen again that rub and now low draws the assignment leot and Coran have four fouls heer goes around the screen heer pushed it out Smith end the clock no and Hadley couldnt get it jayen low 90 seconds to play sixpoint game low wraps it around Diaz Graham wouldnt go Coran haded for a moment got Stripped by Smith and hes foul cam Corin you just got to squeeze the pill man you get a great look another wonderful delivery in that right corner from jayen low guo de Diaz Graham just a really quality look and then cam Corin had it he had it in his hands and he is now fouled out for his second consecutive game six point 7 rebounds and heres a guy whos 47 of 50 at the line this year make it 48 of Applause 51 the Louisville Cardinals one win away from a 16th Conference win obviously its a larger conference schedule but will be a new Conference win record in Louisville basketball history with two to go low Diaz Grahams all alone another Miss three for Pit Austin gets it back to low Cummings will hoist thats way short and its going to be Louis ballet sometimes he comes down to hitting an open shot and Louisville is not going to let Jaylen low hurt them the shots that he has hit over the last couple minutes have been really tough shots the wide open ones have been these other guys and these are the games on the road trying to beat up a good team you got to hit those open looks all right were in an official review to see the out of bounds whos got possession so quickly lets go back to DC Applause D thank you so Zack Austin at 739 gave pit a 6259 lead with a three its a 154 Louisville run since pit has missed its last nine threes just ballparking how many of those nine threes have been good looks I think two of them in that early stretch youre talking about Zack Austin had one off a set play is legged had a wideopen one on the left wing and then these last couple have been open looks now theyre not from your best player but again when the opponent is trying to take your best player out of the game in order to pull an upset on the road one of these other guys has to step up and make a shot and and they just havent been able to do it down the stretch officials are still reviewing the last shot it was called Louisville Applause ball it look like Edwards got a hand on unless it came off somebody elses hand on the way on another angle certainly punched by Terrence Edwards then theres the matter of the clock as well to review all right lets say this is pitball where do you look look here if youre Jeff cable with your team in a threepoint slump I think if if you have an under out of bounds set for a three I think youve got to pull it out of your pocket here you dont necessarily need three out ofs has been overturned blue ball 14 seconds on the shot clock 14 seconds on the shot clock so youre you know youre side out of bounds here and if youve got something for is legged coming off you know thats your ti set play you can take a three if you dont have it though otherwise this has got to go downhill Kevin into the paint youre in the double bonus and then play inside out Lows going to inbound it Cummings on the floor Leed Austin Diaz Grant Le it he will go downhill drive and score and Jeff cable uses his third timeout its a sixpoint game Applause so leget the fourth pit player in a double figures hes had a tough shooting night one for eight from three Louisville has two timeouts pitch just the one do you start fouling immediately if your pit yeah I I think you do but not immediately like I I think you can let this ball come in Louisvilles been a little loose with it and they have it theyve seen a couple possessions of pressure so let Louisville feel your pressure see if you can do something here and then you know you you really they shoot it so well from the line if if you know any of these guys outside of rain Smith you you lay a foul on and Smiths going to inbound it to heurn oh he got held up by low who is called for a foul his third number L thats third see I think he catches it in that deep corner I I think he got time to throw a little bit of a trap on see what Chucky heern does in there and L for the C 24 Chucky HS 12 for 15 at the line again one week ago Louisville record 17 makes theres number 132 Applause leg it back on the floor he had checked out because of the fouls another Miss by heer thre possession game low driving it Diaz Graham back for low hes got Scott on him Way Off the Mark for three Edwards is fouled off The Rebound with 423 remaining largest crowd of the season in Louisville tonight 1845 they have been vociferous all game long Edwards at the line hell shoot two and if Louisville can hit its free throws hang on to the ball this home crowds going to be rewarded with another win will be seven straight for Louisville be 17 and one in the last 18 and his team December 14th lost to Kentucky they have one loss in 2 and 1 half months since at Georgia Tech a month to go Edwards and heer have led the way Edwards of 23 heper 37 and theres a steel Edwards down the floor Chucky will give it to Hadley Hadley Chuy hes got 37 and he still plays unselfish and heers got it and Pits not going to found out only one man who could handle the ball in these final seconds the way this things gone it career night for Chucky heer with 37 points another hardfought pretty grmy Louisville Victory they win it by 11
