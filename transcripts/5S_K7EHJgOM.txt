round against the South Carolina State team hes doing for their first win on the campaign Wake Forest in white South Carolina state in Maroon our officials tonight Tim clagerty and Janelle Spearman Music Carolina State win it but away we go theres a Bulldogs team that really had to overhaul their roster in the offseason still trying to find their footing theyve shown flashes in the opener they went on the road at South Carolina and only lost by three so Steve Forbes was telling us very dangerous team for a Wake Forest team thats coming back from Jamaica on short rest certainly said this is a team that wants to play fast they want to pressure you and he said we must do that right there we must rebound the ball against this team almost a second offensive rebound Applause Music so itll be Wake Forest basketball the Demon Deacons playing without Davion Williamson storm point guard whos out with a back injury tonight damari Monsanto takes his place in the starting lineup making his first start on the season heres Monsanto fires a three and connects open to score Jay we saw his first game last year and thats what he can do a remarkable how he came back from that uh Achilles injury and certainly hes a guy you must find if youre a South Carolina state getting it done on the defensive end swiped Away by Monsanto so an instant impact after getting inserted to the starting lineup for the first time this season Hildreth on the blow by and its five nothing Demon Deacons early Music all right wait comes out Iron Man the man and finally the Bulldogs break through cashing in off the offensive glass with Davion Everett you said it Hawk this is a team that sends all Five Guys to the offensive glass and that could be a problem for Wake Forest tonight yeah Steve Force we asked him uh escort the keys to the game and he said look theyll send five like you said and we must make sure everybody is blocking out on the defensive glass foreign Music good transition defense this was another area that Steve Forbes said they emphasized leading up to this game transitioning said look they want to get out play fast they want to pressure you I think this is where uh Damian Williamson not being in the lineup but certainly uh could be an area of concern with South Carolina state wanting the pressure Applause it stays in attack mode hes got four in the early going for Wake Forest a Demon Deacons team that probably should still be undefeated at 50 lost in overtime they had a eightpoint lead down the stretch in the Jamaica classic against LMU on Sunday with just a minute 30 left of the game Steve Forbes talked with him the other night still cant believe that they ended up losing that game he said it was a perfect storm Applause and it doesnt help that its a tight turnaround Puck too yeah Jay we could sense the frustration uh that he just look he wants to move on he said but thats one he said that they should definitely have won that game certainly though some teachable moments uh endtogame situations execution wise that he wants his team to learn from and then make sure it does not happen as they closer to ACC conference play Music foul on the closeout thatll send Tyree Appleby to the line and theres Steve Forbes the transfer portal Guru as Ill call him and his third season with Wake Forest really enjoyed our conversation with him yesterday touched on a lot of different topics but really likes his group Malcolm totally different than the group that won 25 games a year ago because of all the departures and you know some incomings both through the portal and freshmen but you know really likes this team and in the future here at Wake Forest guy can flat out coach obviously the success he had before coming to Wake Forest and you know what he did last year I would say not too many people were thinking Steve Forbes was going to be coach of the year and ECC the job that he did with that really remarkable and you know he likes this team and hes obviously early on in the season talked about that one loss that they have hed like to have that one back but Tyree Appleby as I said in the open uh they think they found another really good player and certainly early on he has put up some really good numbers of four wake forests and he told us defensively he feels like this group is farther along than they were a year ago which is really encouraging obviously still trying to replace the points of Jake laravia and alondis Williams who were two of the best scorers in the ACC Carolina State doing a great job getting to the rim LG hallams with the third bucket of the nine for South Carolina state LJ hallams coming into the lineup making an impact and keeping it a one possession game Music heres a shake and bake Applebee fouled again Applause Tyree Appleby at the line when we come back just getting started on Thanksgiving Eve from the Joel enamel is the hardest tissue in the body its a protective layer theres South Carolina State first year head coach Eric Martin if the name is familiar thats because it is hes been around college basketball for the last three decades went to the final four with Cincinnati playing for Bob Huggins then joined Huggy Bears coaching staff both at Kansas State and West Virginia 16 Seasons next to Bob Huggins and now ready to run his own program took the South Carolina state job in July well I know the phrase is used a lot home run higher but if youre South Carolina state you definitely hit a home run on this one right here as you said learn from one of the best and Bob Huggins was a great player has final four experience well respected within the coaching community and there is no doubt I think hes going to turn this thing around and get them going in the right direction team started o for three from the floor but now theyve made three in a row all layups theyve done a nice job getting right to the rim Music great Baseline caught the layup doesnt fall everything but the Finish beautiful back door cut that time and pass was on point just could not finish up top fouled on his way to the rim March into the game for Wake Forest foreign Music Steve Forbes telling us that Matthew Marsh is one of many that he expects to take a big step forward this season look at that game against LMU all career highs and Steve Forbes said I dont think thats a fluke we expect that level of production from him over the course of this season yeah and I think look credit uh Steve Forbes and staff talked about what he did with alondus Williams Jake leravia those two guys playing for a paycheck at the next level but the Player Development piece I think thats huge and certainly when you have a guy that size seven one uh Matt Marsh and he said hes skilled hes a guy that can step out shoot the three ball up and score around the basket theyre really excited about what he is going to be able to bring to this Wake Forest scene another great look inside count it plus the foul South Carolina state be stinking to paint all of their buckets coming from inside yeah right here again another little backdoor cut Lake Forest Lake and allowing guys to cut in front of them in South Carolina state are doing a nice job finding Cutters going to the basket this time they were able to get themselves at the freethrow line and one situation could not complete the threepoint play five minutes into this first half Wake Forest has not made a field goal in the last 2 30 Hildreth trying to change that and he does Music great footwork by hillgrips got cut off then a little reverse spend that time into a little jump hook and great individual effort that time great ball movement led to a really good look from three that misfired yo going back to the Player Development piece for Steve Forbes he said when he went into the transfer portal to try and build this roster wasnt just for one and done guys he wanted guys with multiple years of Eligibility so he could start to build something and you talk about a guy like Cameron Hildreth whos taking a big step up in his sophomore year theres a lot of players that have at least three years of Eligibility on this roster yeah talk with them about the radio look they did not think Jake the ravia was going to uh be a first round draft pick when they started off obviously they knew he was good but he did such a good job and obviously he progressed last year where that guy wound up being a first round draft pick as I said playing for a pretty good paycheck at the next level and I think thats a key for him though again hes not looking at and he knows hes not going to get those one and done type guys hes looking for guys that are a fit but thats what he thinks hes found in Thai Apple do as well too right back to cam Hildreth what a start to this game hes already up to eight has half of the Demon Deacons points in the early going Music the first six minutes of this game South Carolina state has committed six fouls so Wake Forest could very well find themselves with a bonus for more than 10 minutes next Val theyre shooting free throws the rest of the way so something to be very cautious of if youre Eric Martin and the Bulldogs and that last possession Wake Forest went to a matchup Zone again they looked like they were showing man but they basically were switching out on the perimeter or giving them kind of a different look uh defensively it would come up with a turnover Music tough take too much on it South Carolina state finally comes up with a stop lets see if they can cash in on the other end foreign Music Wake Forest defense dialed in to start this ball game Appleby great cut the feed on the money offensive foul Applause Music the play was there the unselfish play by Applebee is the passing ability right here again through the defender and thats two guys on on the cutter but thats got to be a jump stop jumper again right there hes running into the defender there he called for the ref to make back the LJ to your earlier Point uh this Wake Forest defense uh dial then thats something that was of concern for Steve Forge hes like listen I did not like how our guys uh defended in that last game and theyve had some issues defending the threepoint line thats something that has been an emphasis for them leading up to this one yeah offensively I think theyre going to be there but Steve Forge lost his defense to tighten up travel another turnover youre right talk about the threepoint defense last two games Wake Forest has allowed 40 percent from three not gonna win a ton of games of your opponent is knocking down 40 percent and theres Zhao ituka the transfer from Marist he was the match freshman of the year making his Wake Forest debut tonight so you lose Davey and Williamson but you get back ituka Steve Forks very high on the sophomore transfer Music another uncontested three South Carolina state still struggling to make the Demon Deacons pay theyve missed their last five theyre o for seven from three tonight seventh foul for Eric Martins Club so Wake Forest will be shooting for the next 12 minutes and 12 seconds on every foul Music thats a recipe to to put your opponent away when you can get to the line with ease now obviously as a coach of being aggressive I just dont want to put guys on Saturday rivalry week and a good one on acc Network 3 30 pm Eastern Time Wake Forest and Duke theyve been playing since 1924 almost 100 years exactly what you look for in a rivalry game and then ACC Prime Time Pittsburgh and Miami Hurricanes trying to get the bowl eligibility little tiedye Nation on Thanksgiving Eve Wake Forest a 10point lead eight minutes into this first half Demon Deacons right now on a six nothing run Music buddy Music one second on the shot clock South Carolina the state heaves it up but it falls finally the lid off after a threeminute scoring drought its not a bad defensive possession again obviously South Carolina state scored but contested got him deep into the shot clock in who said that is a difficult too uh that was contested aggressive take ituka looking for his first bucket in a demon Deacons uniform and a travel on the offensive rebound by Bradford Demon Deacons leading by eight now Midway through these first half Music Malcolm that means somebodys got to make up that production yeah and obviously you look at the numbers with these two guys right here uh one of the more Dynamic high scoring backwards in the ACC Williamson out I think the concern is uh turnovers against this South Carolina State team that wants the pressure obviously to go along with that points per game production that you missed with Williamson out of the lineup other uncontested three South Carolina state still struggling to shoot it from Deep they are oh of eight from three to start this game theyve gotten plenty of good looks cant capitalize on them Applause Carr misses from three offensive rebound but stolen away here come the Bulldogs theyve got numbers another three they keep firing and they just cant connect Music Applause with an offensive foul car spinning into trouble okay thats two possessions uh four wig now turnovers charge here uh the previous play a turnover and that has been the number really we spoke with Steve Forbes he said look uh guys are just trying to do too much its as simple as that you look at their numbers they have more turnovers than assist in the season and he said look thats something that we have got to correct and address uh soon just cant turn the ball over at that clip Music theyve yet to make a basket in the last four minutes the problem is South Carolina state only one of their last eight so theyve been able to maintain an eightpoint advantage three seconds on the shot clock half the heat from Deep too much on and an offensive rebound South Carolina state has missed all terrains theyve taken they are ice cold right now and yet Wake Forest keeps turning it over all the way to the rack of Steel and an easy layup on the other end LJ hallams leads the way with six well the idea right there you have a guy running down the lane you think hes open again thats one of those where no need really to take a risk in that situation youre giving up a lot of ball turnover and then giving that a team that struggling shooting opportunity to get out and transition and get layups to pose to forcing the mission jumpers Music heres car in attack mode he finally Cashes in for Wake Forest who was at a scoring drought of more than three minutes and I like that move by car again dont settle for jumpers if youre awake car had a clear size advantage that time like how he used his body nice little soft touch with the little jump up Music there we go off the window and in had way too much on it but a friendly roll for Jones he has six points so Jones and hallams with 12 of the Bulldogs 14 in this first half back to a two possession game Music Hildreth right to the rack count it plus the foul canned Hildreth is a perfect five for five from the floor hell be at the line to try and complete the threepoint play when we come back Hildreth doing it all for the Demon Deacons right now out of the lineup tonight with a back injury Hawk cam hildred stepping up big time Ski Sports lights up when he talks about this guy he said look he is just a tough competitive dude uh this guy plays off of two feet look at his footwork jump stop jumpers soft touch you look at the production that he has put in early on in this game perfect from the floor and I think the big thing Jay he has not settled for jumpers head fakes getting into the lane getting high percentage shots Hildreth has been the goto guy hes five for five from the floor the rest of his team just two of eight so its all going through Hildreth early sophomore from the south coast of England hes got some great International experience played for the under 16 under 18 British national teams over in the UK I think in his freshman year Malcolm thats a big adjustment to go from playing overseas to now college basketball and hes taking a big step in his sophomore campaign yeah and I think the competitive piece I think thats a key thing as Steve Forbes talked about it at length hes just a guy thats a reliable Defender but he is going to compete out there you need guys like that on your team everything but the Finish there for Andrew Carr split the double team tried to hammer at home and well head to the line for two Music thats a nice close entry pass uh by Hildreth right here again unselfish play thats got to be an and one right there for the car but and if youre Steve Forbes you must like the ball movement and the paint touches Applause Saturday afternoon at 2 30 Eastern time the ACC huddle crew will get you set for the final regular season weekend in the all day long and after the prime time matchup between Pittsburgh and Miami theyll tell you everything you need to know and what surely will be a wild final Saturday of the regular season foul called on cam Hildreth after the free throw by car its interesting Hawk were more than 12 minutes into this game and Tyree Appleby has yet to attempt to shop Wake Forest leading scorer especially with Williamson out didnt think that Appleby would be this quiet now right on cue fires a three and hits it sometimes you gotta talk about him to make the shot come alive Tyree Appleby was slow on the trigger tonight but got a great look and knocked it down oh Music Jay defensively though again as we talked about some of the ball movement of them not settling for jumpers but defensively uh tighten it up South Carolina state has been getting some quality looks theyve been fortunately uh South Carolina state has not been able to connect from three its all 10 of their threepoint attempts tonight stepped on the inline turnover 12 of their 18 from the pain Music s really I have struggled with turnovers early South Carolina state in their losses as well to have had the high turnover number great pass what a block from behind South Carolina States had success in transition through the spin cycle couldnt quite finish it Music kick to the corner Monsanto drills it from three to Santo Music time at Carolina state Wake Forest has made five of their last six getting red hot to this game has come in off the bench in the last two minutes Malcolm he has sparked this Demon Deacons offense with his passing ability uh yes hes putting up some good numbers 19 points uh he scored in the last four games but for me its been his passing thats a beautiful find going into that last time out there for Monsanto in transition South Carolina States still really struggling from three theyve missed all 11 attempts from Deep tonight Music really quality look so theres another one sometimes you just have shooting nights like this especially on the road Malcolm yeah I mean thats not even close I mean theyre getting good looks but they are that did not even draw Iron right there well theres still again hanging around in this game if they were able to make a couple of shots cut down on some of the turnovers uh theyd be within single digits of this game but you said its been a struggle from the threepoint line for South Carolina state heres Hildreth miss the runner its his first Miss of the evening its now six turnovers against South Carolina state Music foul against the Bulldogs to awaken the double bonus shooting two on every whistle now Music and Ford head coach Eric Martin of South Carolina state Defender youre an aggressive team they want to get out pressure you they want to definitely crash guys on the offensive glass but certainly this is kind of a learning process for them early on do not want to put teams in the bonus this early Music Hildreth comes out of the game 13 points its one shy of his career high and weve still got 4 30 left of this first half man another shot that doesnt draw Iron for South Carolina state their scoreless in the last three minutes here Applause Id count it plus the foul Matthew Marsh Music lets see how about Applebee for me right now playing some highlevel basketball thats a beautiful fine basketball IQ uh off the charts and spoke with Steve Forbes and you said the thing that popped out with him was not on the court he said when they went on their Europe trip were getting into that a little bit later in the broadcast he said how guys gravitated towards him and he said I knew early on that he was going to be a leader of this team Applause certainly he is doing a little bit of everything for this Wake Forest Club scoring but again Im gonna say Ive been more impressed with his passing ability and ability to make things he has four assists tonight to go along with seven points Wake Forest on a 10nothing run as they start to widen the Gap much needed bucket for the Bulldogs there Music Applause binning through traffic swatted away but it falls to Appleby shot clock at 15 Monsanto from Deep left it short another offensive rebound and a foul Bobby Clinton at the line would we come back demon Deacon starting to separate up by 17 Music on the road to Madison Wisconsin I dont know if you caught any of that game earlier Mountain but theyre playing in the battle for Atlantis part of our Feast Week final score 4342 Wisconsin against daytones and old school defensive slug Fest Music basketball right there grind them out came right here though your South Carolina state 225 to go in the first half youre trying to get anything positive uh going into the half this has been a struggle though offensively Jay theyve had good looks again its not a question though whether or not theyve had some looks not even just from the threepoint line they just missed us soon some opportunities and we can talk about their schedule starting off they got a really tough schedule Applause Music here at the ACC Network we want to your perspective when youre watching an ACC game so snap a picture take a video tag it with hashtag all the devotion posted to your social media platforms and you just might see it right here on acc Network Wake Forest doubling up South Carolina state 40 to 20 a little more than three minutes left of this first half Malcolm Demon Deacons 15 of 19 from the foul line they have done such a great job not only getting to the foul line but making them count yeah and I think the big thing the patience as South Carolina state three to go off of some excellent ball movement but on the other side Wake Forest theyve done a nice job not settling obviously beginning to talk about it and the bonus and then when theyve had opportunities theyve been all going to the basket swiped Away by Edwards but Appleby like a safety and football read it well has it back for Wake Forest Appleby fires from the corner and hits will be doing it all right now Jay hes got great footwork that time on that shot got into uh his uh movement early and then his footwork on his pullups really a great footwork Music again look at his footwork right here that you cant do it any better Im its one two up into his shot quick release Music fun to watch in the ACC it looks like Steve Forbes have found himself with another good one Wake Forest chin used to capitalize in the statistics that matter 11 points off turnovers Music 16 points in the paint that hasnt been pretty you know at times for Steve Forbes offense in this first half but you look at it 45 you know they they caught fire when they needed to despite that fourminute stretch without scoring yeah and I I think the big thing for Steve Forbes and he mentioned this to us at length hes the book defensively some of the defensive breakdowns and turnovers thats the big thing that has really uh bothered him in particular in that loss uh defensive breakdown and then just cant turn the ball over thus far though in this game theyve been okay but rebounding uh give South Carolinas state credit uh theyre gonna send Five Guys as Steve worth said any offensive possession you know all five guys will try to crash through offensive glass and thats now six offensive rebounds for the Bulldogs in this first half deep three Amari Monsanto buries his third three of this first half Music 48 points most points and a half so far this season four Wake Forest even more impressive when you consider theyre doing it without Davey and Williamson well step aside Timeout on the floor 40 seconds left in this first half Music awesome Wake Forest royalty in the house the night before Thanksgiving 2003 ACC Player of the Year Josh Howard watching his Demon Deacons obviously had an awesome career here in WinstonSalem at number five hanging in the rafters and then went on to have a tremendous NBA career as well one of the Great long list of a great Wake Forest players to come through here he was one of the best and as you said Legend here at Wake Forest went on at the next level had some great success as well too always good to see those guys come back eight seconds to shoot Appleby pull up pop from Deep oh and he buries it Tyree Appleby Applause Edwards trying to answer that goes begging South Carolina state just one of 14 from three Tyree Appleby meanwhile perfect three for three from the floor in that first half this ones the last one what an end to this first half wake is up big in the opening 20 about them yeah balance I think thats the big thing that if youre Steve Forbes youre happy with it its not just one guy we talked about Davian Williams and not being in the lineup tonight Whos going to replace some of his production Monsanto did a really nice job in the first half of picking up some of that misproduction heres Hildreth that time misfiring offensive rebound Monsanto rejected at The Rim contact no call and now a whistle Music Music Santa offensive rebound and sometimes you get an offensive rebound and if you have a putback break go up there in that situation you get a fresh shot clock go rerun your offense no need to force it back up in that situation Music Justin Wilson muscling that one home for the Bulldogs well South Carolina state started off the game they were keeping it close uh because of that right there the paint touches they were not settling for jumpers getting some backdoor Cuts or some interior passing gonna need more of that in the second half to try to call back into this game if you take away the threepoint shooting numbers as Hildreth connects on a triple thats a career high for cam Hildreth 16 points Music back to South Carolina state if if you take away the threepoint shooting numbers the Bulldogs are shooting 13 of 22 well over 50 percent Applause yeah again the turnovers and threepoint shooting really have hurt them and thats when again even if youre open the numbers say you are not shooting the ball at a high clip Music give up a three thats the one guy if youre South Carolina state you have to find them Monsanto buries his fourth three of the night and Wake Forest is up big timeout Bulldogs Applause Dominos delivery vehicles are going to talk about a tough start to the season for a first year head coach Eric Martin in this South Carolina State team first 11 games on the road they dont play a home game until December 13th and that is tough and certainly we talked about how Lee he was hired in the process and obviously Jay in this day and age of mining the transfer portal we talked about the job that Steve Forbes has done he was behind the eight ball uh but again Ill make no mistake about it he learned played for one of the best coach with one of the best Bob Huggins so you know again I think hes a guy that with time he is going to get this thing going in the right direction but certainly to start this season off or with that type of schedule as late as hes taking the job he is going to do the best he can do but certainly not favorable conditions you know we talk about you want to be battle tested you want to use nonconference play to make your team strong for conference play when it rolls around but 11 straight road games to start the season and you know youre going to Rupp Arena Kentucky at South Carolina here at Wake Forest youre going on and playing really tough teams in their building thank you and I think the one you know positive that you can take for that is certainly they will be ready once they get into conference play but youre absolutely right Jay that is a really tough to start off with that many road games and certainly theyre playing in some of the most difficult arenas to play with stolen away will be again dispossessed Appleby lost the handle and it leads to an end one the other way LJ hallams perfect position to cash in off the steal one of the few mistakes weve seen Appleby make in this game again he gets the steal and it just kind of leaves it out in front right there again he has the ball and his right hand guy on his left side he just crosses it back over to his left a kind of a careless turnover those are some of the things that you know Steve Forbes again recents the frustration another one month had some really just uncharacteristic turnovers uh in that game and really cost them but they bounced back brilliantly tonight offensive explosion in the first half 51 points which is a season High theyve made eight of 14 threes even with that Miss from Monsanto still shooting well above 50 from Deep Applause another and one opportunity coming for South Carolina state theyve come out in the second half fiercely competing on the road that tells you a lot about a team when youre down but more than 20 at halftime and they come out shot out of a cannon to start the second half and thats just the breakdown by Monsanto and cannot let Cutters cut right in front of you we saw that a little in the first half and two Forbes pulls them out of the game again these are the little things as DeForest talked about as they get closer to ACC conference play we need to tighten those things up I think look offensively you know they got some guys that can score defensively and then the turnovers in two areas of concern uh thats Steve Forbes is looking to tighten up that stretch of the night for South Carolina State on a six nothing run over the last minute and it ends with a hammer from Andrew Carr oh well hi Appleby is Gonna Make Some Noise uh and the ACC really looking forward to him matching up against some of these really good back courts thats a beautiful dime though hesitation move and then dump off path for a dunk brings so much energy great forest team take another look and Jay this right here again individual play he has a decision to make can I try to score or perform myself or set my teammate up and thats the thing that Steve Ford really is impressed with this young man about his leadership and unselfish play again hes a guy that can score we talked about that 19 plus points four games in a row but his passing and unselfish play really is what impressed this staff Hildreth fouled he has two coming at the line Appleby six assists assists to go along with what youre talking about Malcolm just makes it look so easy too and similar to what alondus Williams did last year again the ACC Player of the Year you know guy obviously that put up big numbers but also was at the tops with assist as well too and when you have a guy that can fill it up uh but also as a willing passer it just makes it so much easier for your offense Saturday is rivalry day in the ACC all across college football some great matchups including Wake Forest and Duke 3 30 Eastern Time to the Pittsburgh and Miami ACC Prime Time football all right here on acc Network Music Applause Music look at that free throw disparity Wake Forest 21 attempt South Carolina state only three and the Bulldogs have already committed six fouls in the first four minutes of this second half theyve done a nice job getting to the rim though when theyve had success on offense its been pointing the pain yeah and Ive been impressed with their cutting again theyve been able to cut a in front of the Wake Defenders and uh they when they havent turned it over or settled Jay theyve had some good spacing Carolina state up on Wake 139 but the diva still comfortable up 20 they went to Winston Churchills bunker Omaha Beach and Normandy so this this trip was about team bonding about history about education not so much basketball and yet he seen it show up with the chemistry that this team has developed because they took those 10 days away and what an experience it is for these young men and you know Steve Forbes as you said is big on that again bigger than Bass educated you guys get about other things and youre absolutely right the chemistry and you know when you talk about Appleby thats when he said book I knew how guys that I had a headaches and certainly a lot of coaches use it towards for team bonding and he thinks this is going to really be a big thing for this team moving forward you know the one thing that he said that I agreed with Malcolm is that right now you you can only take a trip once every four years youve got the resources that you can raise the money why cant you give this experience to these kids every year and it doesnt have to be Europe it can be parts of our own country and its a great point because they they get so much out of it absolutely I mean have these kids go on tours you can do camps and then obviously do some educational stuff as well too I would absolutely agree with them on that and certainly theres a lot of rules that I dont agree with but again extend those four years this something that these kids will never forget it is a Time experience did you get to go on a tour like that during your playing days at Boston College at all absolutely I went on a trip with the former Wake Forest uh Legend Mark Lucas uh AKA Buffy the vampire slayers boyfriend back in the day and now Big Time famous actor I actually texted with him before this game but yeah we went on a trip to Spain so sometimes what happened it was Big East but other conferences they would put together a college tour and Mark Lucas happened to be on that and it was really a lifechanging experience really unrelated to basketball but just some of the friendships and things that you get to experience for Im so thankful you know with Thanksgiving tomorrow he blessed thankful that you know he was able to take this group on the look for those 10 days I didnt realize how much of a history buff ago we were going hour by an hour on the itinerary he had a jampacked with with history and he said he loves how his group really paid attention to the guided tours and really got a lot out of it right to the rim making it look easy Bobby Clinton Music scoring is picked up in WinstonSalem Wake has made three in a row South Carolina state has now made their last seven seven straight makes for the Bulldogs this offense has come to life in the second half Music okay right down the other way Andrew Carr the full alleyoop teams have now made 10 straight baskets combined try Applebee again thats a beautiful dime for his eighth assist really love how he always has his head up looking for his teammates again he is he is turned into a big time fine for Steve Forbes in fact in this down thats now eight assists on the night for Appleby as in here hesitation step back three first Miss of the night hes been perfect until that point Music projected at The Rim Andrew Carr hes starting to let his presence be felt in the skin Music thats what Im talking about right here in transition again he could have taken that a lot of guys again they could have forced that shot up there he draws so much attention three guys around them sets his teammate up and thats what really good players do again understanding when to go or when to get other guys involved thats an unselfish play for by Applebee in transition the words pull up pop and says in visitor raw there for Edwards in South Carolina state they dug themselves quite the hole but the offense is firing we have 23 points in the second half Malcolm after 27 the entire first half and were less than eight minutes into this second half wow well if your coach Eric Martin you have to be pleased though with the effort that your team has continued to put out again they would have been easy for them to fold it up after that first half but theyre continuing to kind of chip away at this thing 12 15 to go in the second half and thats all you can ask for anyway I got it late in the game uh really his guys werent even on campus at the time and got them all back together so hes learning about this team I think if theres one thing that you can take from this energy and effort certainly does mention the 11 straight road games to start the season including this one in WinstonSalem Music Edwards on a heat check Way Off the Mark now Appleby so dangerous in transition trailing in perfect position Bobby Clinton The Freshman lays it up and in a foul called on Applebee Music Music did I just hear Wake Forest head coach Steve Forbes say oyster stew and there were a lot of weird answers there but Forbes might have had the oddest one oyster stew on Thanksgiving hey Im gonna have to Google that one unless you can help me out have you had some oyster stew we gotta ask him next time have him bring us some next time we see him I mean Ive never even heard of him let alone as a Thanksgiving side well Ima let you be the tester at first uh Im gonna let you go first on that one but certainly a lot of interesting answers on that one whats your favorite side Hawk well I gotta go with my wifes mac and cheese thats first first number one there and then cannolis that count as a side a guy who comes to nolis in Italy cannolis I mean its delicious dont get me wrong but thats almost as bizarre as oyster stew when it comes to a Thanksgiving meal Im Im Im Im easy I just like a little green bean casserole nothing fancy man yeah you got to stop saying all these delicious foods man Im getting a little hungry talk about feasting how about this alleyoop unselfish play offensively when they have not turned it over theyve shared the ball of Steve Forbes against it he likes this team uh offensively theyve done some really good things and I think with you know when theyre all healthy uh gives Steve Forbes the opportunity to play with multiple lineups they can go big they can play small finding all that out early on in the season uh prior to them getting into ACC conference play yeah this is a team thats playing without Davey and Williamson star guard whos out tonight with a back injury and yet theyve shown they have the depth the versatility to still come out and play some really really strong basketball Applause and on the topic of feast week Theres Williamson there this is my favorite week of the college

play right there that sequence sums up of Cam Hildreth as hes going to go to the bench for Steve Forbes and you know back to our conversation about Hildreth uh with Steve Forbes hes a look hes just a tough dude grabs an offensive of a defensive rebound pushes the ball out and the break and and again he is just that type of guy the group guy who do all the little things Music first call yeah thats its such we have the luxury of the doing replay slowing it down having different angles Music certainly in that situation though no need to be in a rush if youre awake with the size of the lead Music Music five seconds to shoot South Carolina state has now scored more points in the second half already so with nine minutes left in it if they had in all of the first half foreign continues Music what has been a fruitful game inside for the sophomore well hes got great hands and thats the thing that jumps out but theyve thrown him some lobs uh hes either put him in for dunks or caught him come down with them and then finish uh Steve Forbes and staff and really really excited about his potential 71 great hands and ability to finish a round of the basket they went right back to him and found the wake is now made five in a row on Pace to exceed way more than 100 points tonight youve done it all without David Williamson Music hes so Keen we talked about the numbers of that both he and Appleby have put up early on in the season uh through five games Music again obviously uh need to get him back healthy but Marsh coming off Ive been impressed with him his size obviously gives them a great post presence but his hands really were impressive in this game foreign Music to play Wake Forest up by 29 Music Music well having some technical difficulties uh Jay alter this is Malcolm Huckabee here ACC Network wake with the 8456 lead Music thank you Music Music Music dude Music Music foreign Music back on the line right here South Carolina state with the ball awake Forest uh with sizable lead Music continues to be great ball movement and easy opportunities for Wake Forest Ford certainly going to be pleased with the offensive production that his team has put forth in this game Music everybody get involved in the infection uh an in transition Wake Forest unselfish plays all around in another uncontested dunk tonight Music Music Music all right here unselfish play Monsanto with the Duncan think about his story coming back last year earlier than expected off that Achilles dear and during the off season slimmed down showing off the Hops that time in transition off the beautiful feed its been that type of night offensively for Wake Forest Music Santo goes to the bench productive night for him thus far 16 points efficient from the field four threes made four of eight from the threepoint line and one of the smoothers jumpers and the ACC Music one area of those deep Forbes definitely not going to be pleased with us Music lead but certainly the turnovers continue to be a area of concern for joining us now my partner some technical difficulties with his mics Im rolling solo here but has been all Wake Forest tonight South Carolina state though continues to grind one of the few threes theyve been able to get to go theyre now up to 20 percent from the threepoint line four for 20 it was a struggle but not for Wake Forest they continue to be lights out Music that puts them 53 from the threepoint line theyve had some high quality looks they continue to shoot the ball really well from Beyond The Arc Music another Valley youve done this time set up by cam Hildreth who really uh player the game along with Appleby but Hildreth 19 points uh even more impressive seven boards to assist done a little bit of everything for Wake Forest tonight Music going to break it has been all Wake Forest theyre up big in the second half over South Carolina state Thanksgiving Eve and Wake Forest plenty to be thankful for tonight Tyree Appleby has led the way and quickly Im thankful to have such great teammates like Malcolm Huckabee and our future riding with some technical difficulties there yeah back to Appleby though he really you know impressive the assist numbers at the beginning yes we talked about his 19 points uh per game uh average of this season but his assist his ability to set his teammates up really uh to me is what is going to make him a very special player for this Wake Forest team foreign Music opportunities Music foreign Music Music Music starting off with Wake Forest of verse Duke 330 and then Pittsburgh versus Miami uh 8 PM Saturday on the ACC Network best time of the year right here you got some college football going on college hoops you got NFL uh we got you covered here though on the ACC Network Steve Forbes certainly going to Feast a lot better for Thanksgiving after this performance by his team certainly disappointed after that loss and that he felt certainly they were in pretty good position to win that they needed to come out with some as you tighten some things up offensively uh putting on a very good performance balanced without one of their better scores than Williamson out with a back injury Music certainly other guys picked it up cam Hildreth big game for Wake Forest right now sit down really impressive balanced performance by Wake Forest in this game Music its Wake Forest tonight I think offensively of the amount of guys that that Steve Forbes has at his disposal that the disposal that our stores now can help with this really impressive in this one Steve Ford Raves about his toughness as we take a look at though all his guys are gonna get rested uh hes gonna get a chance to get some guys in that dont get that much playing time but uh back to your question uh Hildreth was impressive but first time looking at uh Thai Appleby I think Steve Forbes and them have found another good one will he turn into londis Williams and bacc player of the year I dont know about that theres a lot of good players uh in this ACC but certainly we are going to be calling his name a lot and Wake Forest games he is really good and I think the most impressive thing similar to alondis Williams but hes a guy that can score but also can set his teammates up but I dont think they need him to be alondis Williams and thats something the C4 has preached to us yesterday during our call Malcolm is he just needs to be Tyree Appleby you know youre not going to replace the ravia and Williams per se but hopefully you get enough contributions from everybody that this team could still be a 25wing team like they were a year ago Steve Forbes is pretty you know straightforward with us look we dont our teams completely different from what we have last year we dont have a lot you dont have a Jacob Arabia um but we got a group of guys where it gives them versatility to put a smile up play bigger um Im intrigued uh by Matt Marsh as well too uh hes a big uh again that offensively I think he will be very productive for this wake team but the key though is Applebee uh he is going to be the guy I think similar to what uh the role that alondis Williams played last year uh how well is he able to control the temple and pace of games obviously you know hes going to score for himself but Music Applause um theres an impressive performance all around balanced I think thats the key word it wasnt just one guy it was a pretty balanced performance offensively for them Applause Music and thats the good Jay I do think though they have to take care of the ball better I think the turnovers again still theres some question marks around that and then defensively uh look South Carolina state struggled shooting the ball but they had some good looks and I think defensively theyre still a work in progress Applause Music but this is certainly well what Steve Forbes and Wake Forest needed into the Thanksgiving uh feast Smiles all around they should be everybody was involved with the action Music six players and double digits of four wake forests South Carolina state again theyre going to come up here again Music guys did not stop fighting and certainly this is trying to get them prepared a full conference play but it was all Wake Forest tonight Steve Forbes wanted his guys to come out with some energy of the ball that they did six players for Wake Forest in double digits led by cam Hildreth big night for Wake Forest 19 points seven to ten from the floor and eight rebounds
