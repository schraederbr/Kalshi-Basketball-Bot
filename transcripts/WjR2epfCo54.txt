out and London Maiden will get us going at half court cheering Tout sends the tip but its Tyler Sprat recovering for the Titans This is a Titans team that is going to rely very heavily on the three ball They put up 40 on Monday second most in program history Heres Maiden working inside Has it rattled in and out Rebound Mohhamd Shrewsbury gets it under control Now its in the hands of Marcus Burton cheering 15 to shoot for Notre Dame Burton looking inside for Tout Now its with Mohamd Hell get the pick Hell look for Sundra on the roll He wont get it Loose ball turnover picked up by the Titans Well turnover on the first possession and a three on the first possession for Detroit Mercy TJ Nato getting the first triple of the night If Detroit Mercy can get those to fall they can hang in there with Notre Dame cheering And theres Burton contested down below Well Will Coach Shrewsbury a little concerned about the turnovers on Monday 19 turnovers for the game uh willing to chalk up a lot of that to first game nerves but you cant feel good about turning it over on the first possession Both teams coming off some nonconference season openers Notre Dame taking down Long Island University on Monday Detroit Mercy fell to UIC University of Illinois Chicago as Burton looks inside Itll go down to Tout and the Irish are on the board on the feed to Tout Pretty good job that time They they doubled they doubled that ball screen and the Irish were able to just swing it and find the open guy Slow rotation by the Titans Detroit Mercy draws the foul as we take a look at their starting five You see tout on the defensive numbers and coach Shrewsbury found a good one in tout Lets talk about coach Micah Shrewsbury Third season at Notre Dame previously at Penn State as NATO two of two from the field putting Detroit Mercy up 52 Look at Notre Dame starting five Notre Dame seven newcomers returning three of five starters 55 of their scoring They lead the ACC in that category The Titans return a lot of scoring as well Sundra to Mohamd Top of the key for Tout Burton rolls over looking inside Has it deflected Loose ball scramble and finally it looks like Tout got a hand in there on the loose ball Well a little bit of little bit of difficulty The Irish are running a ball high ball screen and and the Titans are trapping that ball screen really actively able to get their hands on that ball again Johnson inbounds Heres a look at the Detroit Mercy starting five cheering returning more or less five starters They draw a foul on the inside It was Orlando Lovejoy on the drive and thats where hes going to try to shine Well Lovejoy tried he tried to split that uh that ball screen right there and the the the official who was furthest away called a little called a little whack as he tried to split those two guys 52 the Titan lead Love Joy gets it to Maiden and Orlando Love Jay goes back to the forward working inside on Tout Goes up strong with the right Reeled in by Tout and the Irish will look to push it Mohamd goes in himself Draws a foul on the ground Notre Dames going to try to be aggressive on this music drive but so far its its been a bit disjointed Well theyre theyre they havent handled the traps off the music ball screen and uh and on the other end theyre they they look to like that uh matchup with Maiden on tout although Maiden going to the bench right now Detroit Mercy played everyone on their roster on Monday And as fast as they play its easy to wonder why Notre Dame played 11 Heres coming in off the bench He was effective off the bench in the talent Hell look for Sundra on the interior instead Shrewsbury He was 0 for two from the field or from three as it was Sundra that time from the corner Nato looks inside Back down to Sprat One for 11 on Monday And Natoy goes inside Looks for a Stman Monroe the 71 freshman from Australia Hes 0 for one as Notre Dame resets with Sundra Shrewberry tries to connect from beyond the arc Thats his spot Well coach Rusberrys been talking about trying to really push the ball in transition And thats a place if they can get the ball below the foul line in transition they can get threes for their shooters Theres Shrews again And there he connects the junior got it tying this game He got it calibrated that first time 0 for two on Monday from beyond the ark One for two now as that guard combo with Shrewberry and Burton put together a lot of the scoring for Notre Dame last season cheering Well Braden Shrewsbury off a season where he averaged 14 points a game and was really the most consistent threepoint shooter for the Irish Shrewberry slowing it down Sundra to Mohamd Back to Sundra Shot clock at seven with I almost loses it and hell have to do something here with two seconds Hell go up I tries for the crafty finish rebound Xavier Monroe from the free throw line Lovejoy cant roll it in And that ball will see all night long It just finds Mr Tout Shrewberry draws a big jump and hes off target on the triple Offensive rebound Mohamd back to Tout at the elbow Down to Sundra Nice feed Hes an excellent passer Hes a big guy that they can kind of play through because he is a good playmaker Led the nation in rebounding last season coming out of the Big Sky Conference at Northern Arizona cheering Hes had 48 double digit rebounding games in his career Thats just incredible the 2568 frame Is quite the presence down low as its NATO rolling it in and tying us up at seven Its out back to Shrewsbury Five guys looking to check in for Detroit Mercy I for three front of the rim Offensive rebound Mohamd goes up A chaotic block Notre Dame wanted the foul but instead looks like well have a jump ball Will step aside here Tie game early on here in Southbend 77 Players since hes been there that are currently on the roster from the Detroit area So theyre theyre trying to own the hometown with coach Montgomery at the helm Hes got his team tied up here in Southbend Cole Serta steps on now Mohamd drives in the foul and the hoop Pretty good pretty good matchup right there They got the switch Very physical drive by Sir Mohamad Finish strong at the basket Marcus Burton on the bench right now drawing two fouls or rather following two times early on here Mohamd the guard on Cole Sera another guard has stepped on And there you get the ageold question Do you keep a guy down with two fouls And coach Shrewberry just gave us the answer as he ushered Marcus Burton to the scorers table to get back in the game 1346 left on the clock He stepped off for a couple It looks like it was Sir Mohamad that called for the offball foul So theyll swap guard for guard Burton will step in and match up on Lance Stone Well Will I like that bringing uh bringing Burton back in the game Everyone everyone held their breath there for a short second to make sure that wasnt a foul on Burton But I like I like Shrews bringing bringing Burton back into the game because you dont want him to get completely out of the rhythm of the game Its early in the season youre still trying to work your combinations and uh you need your best player on the floor The foul was committed by Carter of Detroit Mercy as looks like Serta was fouled as he as he rolled over the top of the key Well hes coming at Jai hard for that for that dribble handoff And uh the Detroit Mercy defender the Titan defender there just a little too physical trying to push him off that handoff with Jacquel Cotton the freshman guard forward getting his first personal Burton dumps to Frost He was effective from three This time its Burton trying for three He He is off target Rebound Fiser Fiser to Larry threepointer back with Fischer Hes off target and there goes Cotton getting a nifty deflection saving the possession I do like that three from Marcus Burton on that last possession Good catch and shoot rhythm shot Just a little too strong with it Shot 37 from beyond the arc last season 7 percentage point improvement from his ACC Rookie of the Year campaign two years ago where he shot 30 Well you know thats huge for him because hes such a potent driver that when you have to honor him from the threepoint line its just going to open the rest of that game up Stone gets the inbound Cotton sets a pick Stone tries to shoot over Burton Hes off The rebound will go to Serta Kebab Jai in the game and Burton was working in on Stone Drew the foul Good push by Notre Dame that time Uh really hard for the Titans to match up in transition and Marcus Burton just forces the issue on the drive right there and draws the foul Hes guarded right now by the 58 freshman guard Lance Stone Interesting to see this match up here who was Mr Basketball in Detroit as a junior in high school Will six points on one three versus UIC on Monday for Stone as he looks in on Burton Burton chaotic pass out to Serta Serta finds some space Turnaround jumper rolls out Rebound Fiser Cotton looks inside Stone to Jeter Cotton for three Well you know shooting the three ball a big emphasis for the Titans going into this season and they shot 40 on Monday night Thats the good news The bad news is they only made eight of them Burton went left had it blocked Takeaway for Cotton with numbers Fiser goes to Jeter Jeter goes all the way across to Stone Hell try to go in with the right and some chaotic offense here culminates in Detroit Mercy stepping out of bounds And with that well take a break 107 the Irish lead 330 more threes than they did last year And they were outscored by 300 total points from the threepoint line That one three so far came from TJ Nato in the opening minutes of this game Looks like an offball offensive foul was called here Its like maybe the illegal screen coach Well they they are calling that on on Burton So as he hands it off he kind of turns his body Might have might have been a little bit of a cheap one Look like they got and the defender runs into him and kind of draws it from him cheering Kaylor had the foul Maiden tried to work inside on tout He couldnt find it Heres Shrewsbury way beyond the arc He connects If hes got his rhythm hes got really really deep range As you could just see by that one he was a good 29 ft away from the basket Two for seven from three Heres Love Joy Some midrangers not falling quite yet for the Titans Tout off to Serta Another deep deep three for Notre Dame So this happened the other night and Cole Cert is pretty good when his defender goes under the screen as you can see him go under the screen on Braden Shrewberry Bang And youre going to see the same thing here with Serta goes under the screen Those guys are ready to tee it up every single time as well They should be because both those guys Yeah You look at the freshman role Back when Shrewberry was a freshman his 78 made threes were second most by a freshman in the program And Frost really stepped into form Well get more to him later but he was four for five from beyond the ark The ND freshman that is Nato gets the jump and a nice connection Now Nato is actually the the sn the sniper for the Titans and he led them with I with 46 threes last year Couple triples for the sophomore guard He was one for six from three on Monday at UIC Natos got all 10 of the points for the Titans right now So theyll need to get some other elements of their offense cooking here against the Fighting Irish Tal shot clock running out Hes working in on Maiden Has to go up and under Draws a foul He really forced the issue that time and able to pick up that foul on Mton Four seasons of action at Northern Arizona Over a thousand rebounds missed one of those years with an injury So first four seasons of action one injured And here he is in Southbend Picked up right where he left off in the rebounding category on Monday And he is a rebounding Sabant So he goes and gets it And because hes so great at going and getting it it actually finds him So he he gets some that arent even So he gets his and he goes and gets yours too Coach Montgomery mentioned like keeping him off the boards was a goal I mean thats a lofty goal How do you actually do that That is uh nobodys done it uh ever in the last six years so Im not expecting its going to be an easy task for the uh Titans tonight Tries at it 10 of 10 coming from the sophomore guards to Serta He thought about it Hell go baseline Turn around FaZ on the feed He cant connect on a what looked like a gimme Shrewberry and Kaylor gets Purcell Pavilion loud Kaylor is uh a guy with an incredibly bright future for tremendous ball skills great athlete I mean 610 611 great length and just lost his guy on defense that time Nate Johnson connects That was Kaylors first collegiate field goal Connected on a free throw back on Monday but hes on the board for three But yeah Nate Johnson quickly counters on the defensive end for Kaylor Serta finds Tout Feed for Kaylor Great cut on the 45 degree angle by Kaylor and an excellent find by Tout And we talked about Tout a little earlier Just a a guy with great vision Can see and deliver passes and he gives the Irish a little bit of a different dimension out of their big guys because they can play through him as a passer Love Joy gets on the board led the team last year with 163 points per game fourth in the Horizon League in scoring second in steals Well need to get him going Thats love thats Love Joyys game Uh Will you know we talked about it in the open Get it in the lane Kaylor off target Lovejoy does something similar with the floater in the lane They look to push it with Shrewsbury Hes guarded tight by Johnson on the exterior into touts Looks for a cutter again Puts it on the ground Feeds to Shrewberry Rolls in I tend to shoot right down Main Street Rolls it in Great take by Logan that time Love Joy draws the foul Looks like it was on the ground So look at this drive from Logan Ims Well step aside here in South Bend on the year last year and has had 48 doubledigit rebounding games in his career This guy is just an animal on the glass You cant say enough Six in the country in that double double category And hes got six already tonight Well Keshan Fiser the deep three kind of pass faked Marcus Burton away that time and was able to just tee it up Kevin Jai the sophomore forward gives to Mohamd down to Sundra Back to Mohamd into the corner for Burton Burton calls for a pick from Jai Looks to use it Goes inside to Jai Five to shoot now Mohamd fading away Corner three Rattles in and out cheering Fiser with it now Goes left on Shrewsbury Back out to Sprat Way beyond the arc Cant connect Rebound Trusberry Sundra left open Goes right with it Think he lost it on his way up Sundre played half the game scored five points on Tuesday or Monday excuse me Well I think his development Cole Seras development Sir Mohamads development these sophomores if they can be a little bit super as sophomores they can take the Irish a long way Shrewberry keeps it rolling from three 27 on the board now for Notre Dame Lovejoy goes fast finds a Stolman Monroe Lovejoy able to get really deep on penetration and got a lot of eyes on him and uh the Irish just lost track of the big guy that time First collegiate points for the 71 freshman from Australia but a quick response from Kev Jai This is a tough matchup for Marcus Burton with the with the fouls As aggressive as Lovejoy is in transition want to keep your hands off of him Cotton no good Foul Really good job by Kebai He He came a long way to get that rebound that time rebounding out of his area which is which is a really important part part of a post players game Jai the senior from Centerville Ohio just under six points per game in ACC play last season Came over to Andy from Penn State Shot free throws at a 70 clip last season Hes a pretty good free throw shooter and thats important because everything he does is physical and around the basket Hes going to find himself there quite a bit Off the mark there Love Joy guarded by kicks to Cotton down to Fiser Aiden Carter was good on Monday He goes to Lovejoy and the jumper rolls out Foul as Shrewsbury look to carve it inside Itll stay here Well thats just a good aggressive straight line drive by by Braden Shrewsbury as he gets his defender just a little bit off balance and instead of taking it away from him he takes it right at his hip and almost forces the contact right there another good free throw shooter in Braden Shrewsbury 83 last season Yeah I think anytime you anytime you can get this guy to the free throw line thats pretty good for the uh pretty good for the Fighting Irish Marcus Burton also big on the drive He shot it at 84 after Shberry got the roll on number one swishes number two and insteps through Ryder Frost Well as Braden has improved his uh physicality and you can see hes hes much bigger and stronger even this year than last year he is able to go off the bounce a little bit more Thats going to get him to the foul line a little bit more and hes going to hit those free throws at a very high clip 64205 The junior guard is listed as the Titans go baseline on Frost Theres Legend Jeter with a finish Well they finished They switched the ball screen and ended up with a tough mismatch Frost not able to guard in the low post that time Im seemed to lose control before the foul there but he got he might have got bailed out cuz it looked like he might have slipped a little bit before there was any contact 68 from the stripe for IMS is an area probably hell look to push up a little bit this season Yeah youre right Will Hes got to be better at that And he was one for four on Monday night from the foul line and misses his first one here Uh which is highly unlike unusual for an Indiana guy The junior from Zansville one for two now Lance Stone gives way for Cotton as they run a weave up by half court Back in from Jeter and he draws the foul A little bit of a mixup on the exchange right there All of a sudden Jeter just finds himself with a free path to the basket Frost rotating over just a little bit late Jeter will shoot two 13 minutes two points on Monday His college career has brought him to Providence and Eastern Michigan cheering Here he is with the Titans in his junior year Sir Muhammad will step in IMS will step off The legend Jeter He had 40 starts in two years at Providence So hes played cheering Big East highlevel basketball Not going to be intimidated by uh by by the ACC Irish today Mohamd goes down to Jai Cant turn around and finish Nato to Cotton Cotton for three in and out Offensive board jeter Well in talking to coach Shrewsbury today will there was a big emphasis on being a little better on the on the defensive glass and uh they continue to have the Irish continue to have some problems on that end Aiden Carter the nifty baseline finish The junior made his D1 debut on Monday coming over from Walsh University Hes on the board with the Irish up six Corner from Serta He connects Cole Serta just standing out there Hands ready feet ready Quick trigger on the catch Down to the corner for Nato cheering Rebound Shrewberry Hell push it but instead pull up and connect Nato Strong response from the corner The the Irish just not matched up in transition that time Lost track of NATO and hes the hes the best shooter on the Titan team Mohamd off from three Lance Stone gets the pick looks inside kicks out to Cotton Cotton cheering way off Frost has been good from three and he continues You know Shrewberry made that dribble up three two transitions ago and just what an unselfish play to go ahead and throw it to throw it to Frost when he had a shot he probably could have taken cheering Three points up in both directions Heres Mohamd Frost again Cant keep it rolling And then finally coach Montgomery will ask his guard Lance Stone to slow this thing down as we approach the one minute mark in this first half Notre Dame up 12 cheering cheering down to Jeter Cotton tried to go inside and with that will step aside for immediate timeout The threes going up in every direction here at PCEL Pavilion Notre Dame the 12point lead Theres Nato And its been Frost getting cooking on the other end for Notre Dame J Nato is uh has really rung the bell so far for the for the Titans Um really their best threepoint shooting threat This time Nate Johnson tries for three and the shot clock violation cheering will go into effect Serta steps on Muhammad steps off with Burton on with two fouls in this final minute Burton goes left on Lovejoy all the way Tries the junior but he does get the foul Got himself to the free throw line Maybe get himself going a little bit right here before halftime No points yet for the standout junior Second team all ACC last year ACC rookie of the year his freshman season fifth nationally in points per game last year And he is the third leading returning scorer in the nation this year Will theyll need a lot out of Marcus Burton And he is on the board That one was able to touch every single part of the rim before it went in So you got to get a little bit of a feel right there This one wont touch anything Im guessing the 84 free throw shooter from last year does touch every part of the rim This time this time rolls off cheering Love Joy 15second difference or 25second difference between game and shot clock inside for Maiden They try to trap This time its Sprat Nice bank shots Tough little onefooted runner with a hand in his face Freshman from Farmington Michigan Burton will take a timeout here See if the Irish can draw something up for a final shot See if coach Shrews matters And I think it does Uh thats a plus on the Irish for the Irish We saw Frost step in and make a three as Burton will hold it for the final shot Burton Nine seconds left in the half Kicks out to Shrewberry Hell look to make a move inside Draws the foul with 4 seconds left Pretty good play out of the timeout Had a bunch of different actions but the last action the scoring action was a ghost screen from Shrewberry So he runs at Burton like hes going to set a ball screen Runs through the ball screen confuses the little defense a little bit and uh and the Titans actually got to Shrewberry and he beat him on the closeout You think they wanted the You think they wanted the three from Shrewsberry though I do think they wanted the three Uh it was the play was fairly well defended by by uh UDM and Shrewberry was able to attack the the uh the close out and get himself to the free throw line Hes got one instead of the three Hell look for two here as 4 seconds remain in this opening half Hes got it and uh Lovejoy has it now He kicks to Nate Johnson He pulls up for the buzzer beater and thats blocked at the half Notre Dame 44 Detroit Mercy for 16 Can we cue into that in this second half Well its a its a big deal in that theres a point differential there but theres also a mental differential right Like youre trying to shoot threes but if youre not making them at a decent clip youre not going to shoot them with confidence And you know this is theyre a game and a half in right now Now they want to shoot a bunch of threes but they havent really had a bunch of success from the threepoint line Whereas the Irish they think everythings going in from the threepoint line right now as they shot 50 again in the first half Braden Shrewsbury led the way going four for six Foul on the Titans Turns it over to Notre Dame And its Tout tipping it back in after Mohamd was off the mark Just one more rebound for the machine Down for Nate Johnson Back up for Sprat Love it Tries to go baseline Hes stopped by Burton And a clever feed under to Maiden He cant finish Well Sundra came over to give a little help on the post and then lost track of his guy and got lucky got lucky on both ends Sundra the put back We call that clean living Will four quick points for Notre Dame cheering As Burton almost had a steal but foul is called It goes against the Titans That theres a gutsy play by Marcus Burton That foul goes against Detroit Mercy Ball comes off Theres nobody putting a body on tout Just overhelp on the drive and just leave that guy all alone to tip it back in As easy as it gets for Notre Dame Sir Mohamd over to Burton Hes pressed hard by Nate Johnson Well thats draws the foul Yeah Yeah Will Im sorry that thats just a veteran play by by Marcus Burton Like he just feels the pressure The guys trying the defenders trying to be physical with him and he just forces the issue and draws the fouls right there Just knows exactly when to pull the trigger on that drive Yep Like the officials has to make a call right there Burton looks for Tout on the roll Nothing there Try that pick and roll again Instead hell dish to Sundro Shrewberry Three to shoot Contested three Yes Oh And then sometimes when the ball goes in you can even make the tough one Well cuz that was a wellcontested long range three right there Forcing the timeout is Braden Shrewsbury Five for seven from downtown is the junior and this time it was contested Notre Dame feeling it here in South Bend As you saw on that last one once you got it rolling a little bit everything becomes a little easier and that basket gets quite a bit bigger Made up for a quiet night from Marcus Burton That duo combined for 35 points per game but Shrezberry kind of filling the void tonight as Detroit Mercy knocks in a two intentional post up there They that right out of the timeout they posted uh Lovejoy on Marcus Burton and and were really physical with him down there Sandra chaotic finish and taking care of it is Carson Tout Sundra I think he lost his balance there and just thought hed give uh Tout another rebound Shrewberry to Burton on the fast break The finish and the foul cheering Great great pass ahead by Shrews And uh Marcus gets a little bit of a bump while hes in the air and does the acrobatic tumbling ball and has a chance to complete the threepoint play here See plenty of those highlight reel finishes from Marcus Burton Thats what he does Always looking to drive Finishes the threepoint play Stoman Monroe in to set the pick Hell work in on Tout instead Its Burton knocking it away Mohamed pushing it Burton rightwing three Hes got it Well theyve theyve intentionally gone after Burton Two out of three possessions here with Lovejoy And that time Marcus pulled the chair out from under Lovejoy and got him to turn it over 80 run in the last 45 seconds but thats put through then by Nate Johnson Mohamed looks for the quick response Ball rolled out of bounds Marcus Burton one point in the first half but hes got it moving now Catch and shoot right there by Burton His feet are ready his hands are ready Thats about as easy as it gets Very late contest 37 from beyond the ark In his sophomore year last season Sir Mohamad gets free throw number one Well I talked about it in the first half I mean its its the the freshman class is exciting and we havent talked about uh Harelson tonight whos out with a concussion but I think the sophomore class these guys who have a little bit of experience right now is a really really important part of the Irish uh taking that next step in the ACC Yeah you look at Cole Serta you know you knew he had that careerhigh performance in him for Monday night Tout all the way to Burton Hell go baseline after the pump fake and the foul Thats great vision by Tout I mean hes on one side of the floor Just kind of surveys it and just rifles that ball across the floor to Burton who probably had a had a three if he was if he was uh of a mind to shoot it right there but hes able to attack the close out and draw the foul You mentioned that freshman class coming in Harlson on the bench after Monday Sundra gets the feed on the finish but one of the highly touted recruits in this programs history cheering Yeah he re he he really is Hes going to be hes going to be a great player Uh Coach Drew said he thinks hell be full go by Tuesday Offensive rebound Fiser Hell pull it up from wayon Mohamd in on Nato Pump fake Turnaround finish Good lane line drive Comes to balance off of two feet Pivot Pivot Little half hook over the top Jeter is fouled by Mohamd as the 133 run over the last two minutes continues for the Fighting Irish And so youve got uh youve got Jaylen Harelson as a number 19 in the country rated recruit And uh that is uh going to win some games for you But the reality is will no matter how you slice it theyre still freshman and they got to figure things out And the a big question for the Irish will be how long will that take Absolutely Aiden Carter with the strong finish on the other end Tommy Adaman on the bench this year Hell factor in another key recruit out of Minnesota And theres Kevin Jai Carter working in on drive draws the foul Well it looks like Detroit Mercy this half particularly has tried to go to whatever matchups they think they like and theyre just posting those guys up and playing off of those situations That time they thought they like they thought Aiden Carter had the matchup and he just uh was very physical on the post up Aiden Carter really good athlete four sport athlete in high school Played everything Led the team with 18 points in Mondays loss but you know theyve kept him to five so far tonight cheering Started his career D2 at Walsh University Average just over 11 points per game with them Effective on the rebound as well Burton pressed by Stone Taylor to Ims Ims deep three cheering Carter comes away with it Kicks outside to Fiser Fighting for the rebounds is Ims and Maiden Lets see what this call was here Well I dont know if you saw it but he didnt get the ball but you got a little bit of a show of Kaylors athleticism going after that rebound His hand was well above the square He is a bouncy lanky long skilled athlete Someone coach Shrewberry says has legitimate NBA potential Coming in at 610 205 And uh looks like that ball was just out of bounds We were told to look at that jump way up there Down to Jai Looks for kicks it back up to Serna Burton Euro step and the finish Pretty good snake dribble by Marcus Burton there He came off the ball screen got the defender behind him and just kept him behind him Got all the way in there to knock that one off the board Notre Dame up 28 now About 7 minutes passed in this second half Burton threeon one dumps it to Kaylor and the slam cheering Good unselfish play by Marcus Burton to get the freshman a a big dunk Kaylor the rebound over to Ims back down to Serta Some momentum now for Notre Dame as Burtons pressed by Stone draws the foul on the outside Heres a look at that Brady Kaylor dunk for the 610 freshman number 82 recruit for ESPN Good push ahead Kaylor on the trail AP All State first team in Indiana I think youre going to see a few of those from him before his career is over here in South Bend The Bend Notre Dame We are the Bend Yes Wearing those uh the Ben jerseys tonight The gold trim on the black jersey and shirt and shorts Honoring South Bend with some symbolism in those jerseys including the Studebaker car factories at the foundation of this city Two more good looks from three from the Irish Nato baseline on Kaylor Tries to loop it back around and hes fouled Well Kaylor was on his hip on the drive there the entire way And at 611 he probably doesnt have to go after that block just does a little too much at the end He gets called for the foul cheering Run the team with 48 threepointers last season as cheering this Titans team will continue nonconference with Clearary in a few days Theyll play Eastern Michigan and another big matchup against Michigan State on the road pretty soon coming up in late November Itll be a little bit of a homecoming for coach Montgomery who spent a lot of time as a coach and a player in East Lancing Hes got an entire roster of Michigan guys The entire 14man roster Quite a few Michigan players went to Yeah 14 Michigan guys and one Australia They went to Yeah Ontario for one Australia for Eston Monroe You heard that buzz in the arena recently That was the student section recognizing the fact that two consecutive missed free throws earns them free nachos So that was a nacho ball That was the nacho ball over there I I did not realize that would have been a little more attentive to that if I had known that was a nacho ball See if we can get in on the deal I vaguely remember that from from last year That stone feeds into Stoman Monroe Back out for Fiser Looks like a whistle comes in Was it Fischer foul or was it down below on the rebound They got him on the rebound Two minutes scoring drought for the Titans Sunju checks in Jai steps off Out to Nato Another foul This time on Serta Well when the guy puts it on the floor initially you really have to show your hands You cant have your hands down and around his hips And that thats what happened to Sera right there Its just an easy call for the official Civil reset with another inbounds Nato Hes got it Cole Sera ran right into that screen on the out of bounds Gave Nato just enough room to squeeze that shot up Over to Sundra to the wing for Serta In and out Rebound kicked all the way over to Nato Baseline jumper rolls out for Fiser 12 minutes left in this one Im spin move tries to finish with the right No good Little life here from TJ Nato Connecting from the corner Getting to the line Getting to the rim Knocking down open threes doing what he does Pressing Lance Stone right now up the court Heres Fiser kicking to Natal Stman Monroe 71 in now Went for the rebound Cant get it Shrewsbury to Burke Mohamd he has six drives in and make it eight Well that was a uh kind of a freshman mistake by Stone right there He he wanted to switch when there just wasnt time or space to do it and gave Sir Mohamd a straight line drive to the basket Nato stays strong from three Mohamed Thats the screen from Tout Theyll go to the big man down low Hes up on Melman Monroe And the takeaway for Nato is sent to Fischer or to Johnson rather And he slams it down Seven for Johnson Tout working inside spins around finds his way Well will that was on that possession before was only the fourth turnover for the Irish and they turned it over two of the first four possessions of the game So theyve been playing pretty mistake free with the basketball since the opening Another takeaway for Burton Hes up on Stone He has it blocked by Johnson but the foul is called Burton had a lot of space here working on Stone Heres a look at the Johnson dunk And then heres Tout working in on the Stoman Monroe Good spin move by Tout And theres the Burton finish and and foul You see the foul in there or some objection from the Titan bench but he he you know what when youre when youre one of those guys youre going to get some calls from time to time Uh but what you saw that doesnt really show up in the stat sheet doesnt count is the guy whos right there following it up running the floor like a crazy man is Carson Tout cheering So if the foul isnt called hes f hes making that basket on the follow Touts got nine Four for five from the field Add on a free throw So some offense too from the transfer from Northern Arizona Well he had a little trouble f in his 19 rebound game the other night He had a little bit of trouble finishing around the rim and hes done a much better job of that tonight Sundra tried to pick it off Instead the Titans nearly throw it out of bounds They get the turnover Burton gets it on Stone The tip back from Tal There he goes Off ball fouls called it Looks like they got Marcus Burton Be his If it does go against Burton itll be his third personal because look at that put back from well he he just moves everybody out of the way Nobody really goes to put a body on him and thats a big mistake You better find a way to check that guy off the glass N pump fake leans in gets a crazy finish That is a tough shot right there Pretty high degree of difficulty Double pumping leaning in Gets it to go Burton drives in with left dishes off to Mohamed the N1 Great penetration by Marcus Burton Draws a lot of attention and then just drops it off for Sir Mohamd for an easy bucket and the foul 10 points for the sophomore Hes got three guys staring at him Just drops it by him for an easy basket That is the fifth foul on Nate Johnson the sophomore guard for the Titans So he is done for the night with nine minutes left in the second Out to the corner for Cotton In and out on the triple Burton drives in jump back finish Got right to the front of the rim Kind of euro stepped Played off two cheering Knocked in the little sixfoot floater Three of their last three for Notre Dame And another foul is called on Marcus Burton So I will step in and take out the junior from Mishawaka Thats four cheering Marcus Burton hes got the competitive juices flowing this half I think theres been a a few words shared back and forth between the teams and he is uh cheering kind of ending the conversation with his play Got a nice cheer from the crowd Burton and Lance Stone Looks like theyve been jaw at each other all night cheering Well the games hard enough laughter to if you if you can play and talk at the same time youre youre a pretty effective guy Im in for Burton The deflection spares the turnover You can just see when Tout has the ball off the low post his teammates cutting and being really active because they they can sense that hes going to be able to find him if they if they cut themselves into an open area Sundra comes around Ims looks inside Hes guarded tight by Stone Deep three for Sundra Knocks it down That was actually IMS that knocked that one in and and uh good to see him knock in a perimeter jump shot Yeah I beg your pardon Its a junior guard from Zansville 8753 Tout looks inside He might do it himself here Turn around Cant get the roll in Sprat pulls up from the baseline Knocks it in Oh thats a tough shot off the bounce Pretty good contest Zerta deep three No good Rebound Carter pushes in on Serta Nicely contested Sprat to Stone Shot clock at 12 Shake and big three off target for the freshman guard IMS up in the paint guarded by Sprat Shrewsbury five of eight from three Dishes to tout And theres Sundra knocking it down from downtown Well you got to you got to love with Northern Arizona last year So its no surprise to tell you music hes got one tonight His 49th career double double And uh I you know what I music think whats even more impressive so hes right now hes got 10 points 11 rebounds is hes also got five assists to go along with that So offensively the Irish are able to play through him but hes able to create offense not necessarily music by scoring but by involving his teammates So many dimensions of the game for the veteran transfer as London maiden the freshman or I beg your pardon the junior forward 6A 250 from Cleveland knocks it in for Detroit Mercy The hit maiden on the short roll there Frost comes around and thats what hes been doing Well hes not going to get a whole lot more open than he was that time This guy got hung up on the screen Feet together hands ready Just knocks it in Ean Fiser up on Kaylor Step back jumper Cant get it Mohamd on the other end Chaotic dish out Intercepted by Cotton Hell go to Fiser and hell bank it in Sir just went got a little bit too deep that time Serta off the mark Maiden finishes with some strength Very poor poor job off the miss there by by Notre Dame in transition and uh the Titans made him pay Serta cheering And theres Kaylor getting on the board again He shoots it like its supposed to go in Fischer with it now Played about half the game Monday 511 from the field Titan triple wont roll Frost to Serta He goes baseline Loses it Good push ahead by Frost right there So look at that last three Kaylor in the corner Pretty contested too Well its different when youre 611 right So its a little harder to contest that shot because he hes got a very high release on his jump shot too He he shoots it from way over his head AP All State first team in Indiana got 10 points And Will he is an alum of Cathedral High School in Indianapolis the same high school that Coach Shrewsbury graduated from and where I recruited him as a student athlete Connections keep coming Heres Nato off target Taylor from Fisers Indiana shares that high school alma mater in Cathedral High I dont think you can leave that guy continue to leave that guy open in the corner like that Cant get it this time Fiser now Quick response Frost has six Hell give it to Jai Mahana Dealer He thought about it This time its Frost Way off on that one Serta No basket but the foul There you saw it again Kaylors athleticism He just hops up in the air over everybody and taps that one in even though it didnt count 9663 Heres a look at that last one as Kaylor tries to get the last minute tip in We step aside since he was born his uh his father Brad played for me at Depa and his mom was a uh a great soccer player at Depal as well Good moment for the sophomore guard from Boston as Frost rolls in a free throw Jared Larry now in the game Quiet few minutes on Monday The senior from Grand Rapids And the whistle though Also in the game now is Matthew Mlullen Didnt play Tuesday Coming off five seasons at Madonna University Number 34 for the Irish Matthew just a little too aggressive on the hedge there Got his knee into cheering and out for Larry gets a pick from Mlen Mlen now with the feed Looks in for Frost Loses it briefly and goes to the corner Stevens down to Ims Mclen Stevens two to shoot The shot clock violation though The Irish too slow on the offense Well theyre not not not good communication You got guys who arent havent been in the game and uh typically youd like to have your bench counting down that shot clock right there Stolman Monroe gives way to NATO D3 sprat splash cheering Ryder Frost to Mlullen over to Nimes Tough defense from the Titans Frost pump fake pulls up again cheering Doesnt get the bounce given the final two minutes here cheering Notre Dam on the

baseline and hes on the board at Notre Dame One of one cant be cant be any better than that One of one cheering 100 comes from the sophomore Heres Brady Stevens First career bucket Brady Stevens Good physical drive Takes the bump and finishes with the left hand on the other side of the rim Great take by Brady down low for Stman Monroe Pretty good look by Nato off the curl led the team in threepointers last season TJ Nato under a minute as Notre Dame about to go up 20 Frost a quick bucket Notre Dame will have Eastern Illinois coming to town on Monday 730 You can catch that on the ACC
