talking with players and using the talent that he has to to create a style around them all right so the canes in white the visiting Rattlers in the green headed right to left Miami will go left to right here in the first half officials for this basketball game here this evening Billy Covington Jr Jerry heater and Kevin Milner balls in the air itll be Rattlers basketball the first possession here tonight lets see if the Kings can ramp up some defensive intensity right out of the gate we were talking earlier and we thought the first two halves of those first two games just not enough urgency most definitely Kyle they just didnt seem to move with a purpose whereas in the game the first game with Lafayette everything they did was with purpose but they came around in the second half I just hope they pull it off here where they can come out with intensity and purpose right now put back is good for the junior out of Atlanta Jalen Bates this Rattlers team Murray under the direction of Robert McCullum in his sixth season returns just four players and a majority of his roster are junior college transfers yeah he definitely has a challenge on his hand trying to get them all to mesh and play together and you know hes had some success at FAMU and the uh in the conference play so I look forward to hell probably give him a challenge tonight Florida a m is over three they are over Oregon to start their season out in Oregon taking on the Ducks Portland and Oregon State they start at 03 again returning just four players Robert McCullum another guy we talked about Coach Lauren anger Reviving a program a little bit Robert McCullum in his sixth season has done a really nice job in particular in conference playing the swac yes he has so hes a creative guy as well and hes going to come out and make the most of what talent he has and you know with the junior college kids coming in and transfers its always tough to get him to mesh quickly but hes done a great job of that theres a steal for Wooga Poplar in transition shimmies in the lane hangs and hits I tell you wilgar really knows how to use his body to get himself open great steal and great finish physically a much different basketball player in 2022 as opposed to last season in 2021 Hans Luis Jean Jalen Bates Chase bars Noah Merritt and Jordan Tillman the starting five here at FAMU tonight and here he is well get taking it to the Finish using his body strength there to face up to square up to the goal and and finish it off vowel was on Jordan Miller is he on the court with Isaiah Wong North Channel mere Nigel pack and look at Poplar so these same starting five for Coach larnega through Miamis first three games Applause thats taken away by Miami and now the Rattlers get it right back bait swipes it away and thats a big block at the rim for omir yes it is thats a little sign to the uh Rattlers to not bring it in there unless they bring it in strong here it is hes going up to the hole and omir comes up from behind swats that ball look at that very athletic play Music and Aaron gets it into bars and Marin gets it right back weve got a whistle on the floor Billy Covington will chatted over Im not sure what he called here well theyre going to call foul on North Chad OMeara itll be his first in team second I think the rest are trying to get control early here theres a lot of physicality going on underneath and I think theyre trying to get them to clean it up a little bit well youd think theyd probably go talk to the players then it was odd that to call the foul but Im not sure what elicited the discussion between the two Music Stillman top of the cube of the basketball for the Rattlers 22 two minutes in 10 seconds in here in Miami tonight to the rack Merrick gets it swatted away and take it away Jordan Miller and transition a strong finish at the rim and you know what that was a great lead pass for omir hit to hit Jordan Miller on the Fly there great play great teamwork between the two Applause its a high low offer for FAMU a motion offense three in the corner on the way no good too short for Bates long in the pink triple team had it taken away it was swatted away by Hans Luis Jean the junior out of Lake Worth Applause yeah you never want to pick up your dribble thats when you get in trouble that way that rolled off the rims for Tillman Music long tries again and misses off the back of the iron Jordan Tillman probably the best player for FAMU hes got 36 points through his teams first three games he can shoot the three theres a turnover for FAMU but Tillman and then you take a look at Byron Smith who does not start but hes the second leading scorer through three games and hes gonna check in right now so between the two they have averaged uh 20 points here so theyre going to have to put up some points tonight to try to hang in with the Kings the junior out of Toronto and Gillette College a transfer checks in for the Rattlers Rattlers and a straight man Music Applause Miami loves to run that motion offense omir calling Fork on the Baseline spins hangs and fires that he makes it yeah thats what makes him a great asset as well hes such got such a big body hes a Bruiser down low and he can really turn and have a soft touch on the shot like that one lets see 62 Miami early although not a whole lot of offense any early going Music Tillman again lost his dribble and he steps out of bounds does Byron Smith another turnover for Florida a m or did Smith call a timeout in time he may have I think Smith called the timeout in time under 16 media timeout here in Miami 62 Kanes early teams they struggled in the first half now not so indicative against UNC Greensboro but they did Trail after the first half in both games before really turning it on this is an example right here that you cant control your shooting every night right some nights its just not going to fall like they didnt against Lafayette so youve got to counter that with great defense and so as long as Miami continues to produce on the defensive end they can overcome the knights to not shoot him well what do you see out of Miami early offensively here tonight I see a lot more patience than I did against Lafayette and Greensboro so I think its going to end up going well for them taking their time getting better shots Nice Shot Byron Smith hits just inside the threepoint line with the shot clock running low they come in with the Press trying to trap them Music Luis Jean spins he finds bars and a pair for bars and were all square thats a nice Trail shot from bars catch the big man coming down the lane hit it from the top of the key and presumably Robert McCullum turns off the defensive pressure maybe to force Miami into a turnover and not let him get too comfortable offensively as Jordan Miller has it SWAT of the way by Issa the Junior at six feet eight inches tall now Tillman an opportunity to give FAMU the lead he does Miamis gonna have to pick it up theyre getting a little bit of a lapse here they need to uh start focusing and concentrating I think the coach changing his uh McClellan changing his defense has flustered Miami a little bit here first time really this season through two games that Miami seen that hybrid full court pressure make you work to get the ball across the timeline yeah they make you be patient take care of the basketball five on the shot oclock Nigel pack has it swat out of the way working Baseline right in trouble Isaiah Wong stepped out of bounds another turnover for Miami Applause canes are a little bit rattled I think that half court trap is rattled them a little bit they just need to relax calm down and get back into their game Jordan Chapman checks in for Florida a m a quick six nothing run for FAMU out of the timeout Music nearly taken away by Wong Applause good pressure atop the threepoint line for Isaiah Wong now Smith works in the paint had a good look at The Rim but omir said not so fast young man another great block by OMeara Tillmans a baller Smith hands it off Baseline 10 foot jumper for Isa no good and they sky at the rim no foul underneath its finally in the hands of Anthony Walker who nearly took it away Isaiah Wong in transition Poplar for three too strong balls in the air Tillman brings it down before it rolls out of bounds Miami did everything right on that transition it just didnt go for him Tillman with the left hand up and under off the off the glass wow thats an eightnothing run yeah see thats a tough move thats where Omar came over but he didnt commit and come over and try to take a charge hes used to blocking the ball now so hes going for the block on that instead of step over and try to stop penetration Tillmans got four Rattlers on an eightnothing run out of the under 16 media timeout Walker had omir open underneath but he hesitated now Poplar Rises and hits sweet pullup right there its a bit of a lost start in college basketball today that 10 to 15 foot range jumper everybody gets so focused on that threepoint line they do forget about the medium to short range shots which many times are what blows the game go open right you hit a few if youre having trouble from the outside you shoot a few midrange Tillman catches nothing Poplar thats an easy alleyoop right there great teamwork from those guys you can tell they played together they didnt look hardly at all to each other and just knew it was coming and thats Miami basketball in transition force a turnover into an easy bucket you got it Miami the second best team in college basketball last season in transition as Poplar since Jordan Chapman the sophomore out of Birmingham here it is he throws it up knows exactly where where hell be and there he is really knowing your teammates right there they could probably do that in the dark ER with a little Olympus he goes back to the Miami bench along with Nigel pack in the Olympia is getting a little worse and now hes shaking his head as he works his way back towards Miamis bench I think Kyle it looked like he had a little bit of a charlie horse right so yeah hit him with the knee just in on that play So hopefully its a shortlived one well Marin has it being guarded tightly by Isaiah Wong now with double team up top good luck for Williams paint Williams red shirts off and ride at Tampa hits Lawson State Community College transfer Ryan is a little slow uh on the recovery there right you got to help him recover you got to get out on your man cant just leave Applause Music Anthony Walkers three is way offline but North Chad omear gets it right back an offensive rebound and a flush he was in the perfect position on the weak side for that ball to come off on the opposite side picked it up use that strength to go out and flush it Applause Anthony Walker has worked a lot over the course of the summer on his threepoint ball and it has just not come to fruition here early in games as to Rick Issa takes a couple too many steps well head to the under 12minute media timeout all square here in Coral Gables 1212 a double header for you Florida State hosts mercer at the Tucker Center in Tallahassee at 6 30 Eastern then number seven Duke Coach Bellarmine and Cameron Indoor both on acc Network in the ESPN how about those Florida State Seminoles off to an 03 start this season lost home at home against Troy last night thats an awful start yeah the state seems to struggle it right now right UF lost to FAU last night so its gonna have to really knuckle down and start playing hard out of the timeout thats the joke foreign Music pressure here a little token pressure the first three of the game for Miami they connect Music Applause its an easy bucket underneath yeah Omar reached over but he didnt come over with the body he just did a little bit of a reach wave lie Rattlers stay in that full court pressure Applause Nigel pack and Bentley Joseph running the point and North Channel mere travel a positive that was a travel Jordan Miller checks in for a North Channel mirror back in for FAMU is Jordan Tillman Tillman with a quick rest he does not sit a whole lot uh if hes not in foul trouble again the best player for Florida a m University yeah theyre going to need him on the court for his Firepower hes got 36 points for the teams his first three games against Oregon Oregon State and Portland now if theyre in the Pacific Northwest last week bars with his back turn to the basket Tillman has it working on the left wing fires and its blocked by Anthony Walker Here Comes Miami its a three on one in transition Walker had a hard time picking it up and establishing a dribble and then Jordan Miller has it taken away by Chase bars that was fantastic defense by Walker down here its just a shame they couldnt convert it the other end I think a walker ended up surprised he was open with the ball as close as he was down there he had his head up and down a couple of times and just could not find a dribble on the basketball so 1514 Miami leads 9 35 left to play that shot is way off to the right out of the right hand of Byron Smith again Miami in transition working quickly Jordan Miller stops and Pops fires away for three its a bit too strong Anthony Walker tried to Corral the rebound he couldnt its into the hands of bars hes their best rebounder for Florida a m Chase bars the senior out of Tampa and the transfer out of Western Michigan Tillman in the lane nearly had it taken away now a double team up top Tillman wants the basketball over here on the left wing hes barking for it Chapman hangs in fires and he gets fouled hell head to the free throw line kind of a sloppy uh possession there Miamis doing some jump switching where they go with the double team here he is tries to drive Baseline to cut him off and Walker comes over and leaves his feet and commits a foul Applause first Rambles in and out for Jordan Chapman the sophomore out of Birmingham Shelton State Community College transfer hes really physical in the paint you saw it on his drive there and hes really good on the glass as well yeah hes a really good rebounder no doubt again theyll need that tonight here they come with the uh threequarter Court trap right here Miami needs to look to get it to the middle there it is thats how you break the Trap right now at three he is on the way and another air ball for Anthony Walker whos having an awful time from threepoint territory to start the season he seems to be rushing himself a little bit when he gets the ball like that maybe put it down for a dribble or two and then take a shot theres the midrange were talking about Walker really athletic too he can get to the rim and thats an offensive foul on Chase bars Miami right there had great help caused the foul right there here he is coming off the pick theres Walker stepping over to help and creates the foul really good help from Walker and bars just had a really wide base there at the threepoint line and took that left knee and just gave him a little bit of his these kind of shot them a little bit they think they can get something out of this trap I think theyre going to stay in it for a little while look at Poplar checks back in from Miami he had a little uh got locked up with his knee early on and he kind of wobbled on over to the benches Nigel pack gets a pair but uh Poplar back in he was shakes off that limp we saw earlier thats a move from pack that I think hes done before at KState many times Music First Team all Big 12 last year Associated Press First Team all big 12 average 17 points for the Wildcats yeah I think theres a lot of teams that have seen that Music Applause Ill tell you Kyle theres that athleticism right not only they have skilled players but these guys can get up and get it done they go up and catch the ball another fantastic teamwork on those two parts a perfectly executed lob by Isaiah Wong and without hesitation North Channel mirror with a onehanded slam off the alley oop and you can see how plays like that really pick up the intensity right here right they pick up the turnover right here another takeaway a quick three for Nigel pack no good too strong off the back of the iron now Florida a m with an opportunity in transition Chapman gets to the rim and hits 1917 close ball game 650 left to play here in the first half Miami has played now what has been three really close ball games here in the first half suppose its an opportunity to run away with it here but uh its been close early Isaiah Wongs three is no good Miami struggling from the threepoint line here in the early going tonight now just one of seven they made 13 threes against UNC Greensboro Last Friday Night and thats Miami basketball take another look at that alleyoop great great teamwork together again you can tell they played together Isaiah throws a Team 17 Miami lead 625 left to play in the first half here when Coral Gables uh murt your impressions sear through what nearly the first 14 minutes of this contest its been a little streaky out there theres been times with a fantastic execution and really good defensive intensity and then they have last there are a few lapses here and there that have cost them Im not sure I like the rebounding Miamis only uh has eight rebounds and uh uh Florida a m has 12 Id like to see that get a little higher Florida a m has four offensive rebounds Miami just won Poplar hangs and fires way too strong and the rebound is down in the hands of Jalen Bates now to the rack is Smith he fires no good Poplar and Miller soar for the rebound in transition another alleyoop long to omir there it is great pass by by a popper up to Wong Wong hits him for the alleyoop something else to keep an eye on Miami just one of seven from the threepoint line they were 13 of 27 in their last game 10 of 34 they shot 34 threes in the first game of the season so not all that bad shooting over 30 percent well over 30 percent in the threepoint line but struggling here tonight theres a three on the way Jordan Miller Corrals the rebound its too short by Byron Smith now North chathamir again he is just starting to take advantage of those Rattlers down there on the paint yeah he has he really worked the Baseline well there took it underneath came up on the other side for an easy hoop for him omearas got 10 points and two rebounds and now hes got a takeaway here he comes in transition hes got 10 give him 12 quick hands Strong finish really playing well right now Robert lets call him wants a timeout I dont blame him well take a quick break quick six nothing run in a minute for Miami Music 2517 Miami leads it eightpoint lead their largest at the 9456 left to play here in the half Miami on a quick six nothing run out of the media timeout yep doing it on the defensive end right creating opportunities for him at the other end really good transition place by Miami and the problem for Florida a m thats four turnovers in the last four minutes nearly another now a double team up top Smiths in trouble and now an advantage for Florida a m Williams cant hit he had Byron Smith down low and underneath her check that Jalen Bates it was a three on two opportunity Ford a m couldnt take advantage now on the other end look at that beautiful spin move in the paint for Jordan Miller fantastic athleticism by Jordan great finish great defense on the other hand thats really what created that down on the other end went left in the paint spun back right that shots no good Bates with an offensive rebound another opportunity now for Tillman and Company Williams will fire away for three and hit Peyton Williams red shirt sophomore 67205 with forward hits a three stops the bleeding of the Miami run here comes Isaiah Wong open three Wooga Poplar passes it up says you know what I am going to take it Miamis one of eight Fable on the floor thats on Byron Smith time out on the floor well be right back 12 points he 606 a perfect six of six from the floor couple of blocks so amirs got two rebounds having a terrific night so far he is Ill tell you six for six pretty easy to get when youre two foot away so hes really doing a good job getting good position inside hes got a couple alleyoop dunks thrown to him so uh hes just uh hes having a great game he has two blocks too in Miamis been great inside the yard theyre one of eight from three but 13 of 24 overall shooting 54 percent Florida a m with nine turnovers Miamis got 11 points off those nine turnovers really the difference in the game so far and thats really that hedge against the games where you dont shoot well right if you can get the other team to turn the ball over with your defense you get to the other end get some easy hoops Miami ball out of the media timeout inside to Miller who gets fouled hell head to the freethrow line Bates committed the foul oh so Miami by seven as Jordan Miller heads to the free throw line womens basketball game of the night Kevin up on Thursday Don Staley number one South Carolina taking on Clemson and Little John Coliseum both teams undefeated coverage begins at 6 East theyre in Clemson South Carolina Murray your alma mater yes it

they happen hes seven of seven is from the floor its one of one from the line 15 points two rebounds and an assist Miami by 10 in transition Jordan Miller Florida a m is really flustered by Miamis jump switch right when two guys come together theyre double teaming them and thats really causing Florida a m some problems thats taught having a heck of a Time even setting anything up offensively Music tight can test the defense three in the corner is good hunts Luis Jean Junior Ave in northwest Kansas Technical College another transfer for Robert McCallum Music IR wants the ball down low hes calling for it popper hands it to Miller thats an easy assists for one to Poplar very creative he went down the left side of the lane there it was omir but he was focusing on him trying to post up on the right side foreign leads at 11 for Miami Music Southpaw Tillman drives left on wall Fades away and misses well the Poplar has the rebound and line is going to push the ball at the floor again Nigel packed for three no good rattles in and out north chattelmir fighting through three Rattlers and does he have it well he might have possession of it but its a jump ball and itll be Miami basketball 20 seconds out of the shot clock good hustled by the hurricanes ball comes off getting on the floor after it here look at the uh for the entire game right there good Hustle boys Chase bars checks in for Florida a m 133 left to play here in the half largest lead for Miami hes been 12 both teams have gone on an eightnothing run Isaiah Wong gets Tangled Up underneath hell head to the freethrow line Florida and a m is playing a man underneath the goal like that which is unusual right so thats exactly what can happen if you play a man down low most teams play a Zone when the balls out under the basket like that its the second or third time that famus got beat right there off that inbounds pass on the Baseline long makes the first Applause by the way for Isaiah Wong his first point here this evening and its a milestone point for walk with this one point that he just made the front end of those two free throws hes now the 18th player in Miami Hurricanes program history with 1300 total points so congratulations to Isaiah Wong fourth year Junior has been terrific for Miami and now he puts it home jump switch continues to give Florida a m some trouble at the top Miamis going to get turnover after turnover out of that four quick points for Wong after he was shut out for nearly the entire first half omir pacing the way with 15 this could have been another turnover Byron Smith bailed out by the foul heres the wongdong Elevate send it home thats the reward for bet playing good defense on the other end thats similar to the dunk we saw against Lafayette in the second half but sparked Miami the opener yes it is thats the thing about dunks right most people think oh its just for show it really does serve a purpose it it really does get the team fired up and sometimes can turn a game a couple of big dunks for Miami here in the first half leading by 15 under a minute left to play much more aggressive first half offensively and with a purpose for the Hurricanes here tonight Mars is wanting to get involved down low there he is good look for bars that he misses gets his own offensive rebound Byron Smith out to Chapman he drives in the paint and gets a bucket Chapmans got good strength to go under the ball I mean hes going to the hole with strength Jordan Millers got ten and three for Miami teams can hold on to it for the last shot straight man here hi Joe pack might just wave him off and go to work on Chapman goes right comes back left Stutter Step Chapman to his feet at the horn Nigel pack gets fouled with 16 left he had Jordan Chapman on ice skates on the right wing and Nigel pack will head to the freethrow line Ill tell you that foul that the buzzers not going to make uh coach McCollum happy boy Chapman got caught on his heels so leading by 13 Pat could make it 15 headed to the locker room at halftime makes the first hes got three points Miller and omear pacing the way theyve got 25 of Miamis 41 here in the first half its amazing Wongs got four pack might have four he misses so hes got three but those two guys can get hot in the hurt halftime here in Miami Chains lead the Rattlers by 14 big first half for that young man North Shadowmere a perfect seven of seven from the floor three rebounds 15 points Kanes in control at the recess after tonight for Miami they will visit Providence be good ball game how about Isaiah Wong they were in the first half Four Points creeping his way up the alltime scoring leaderboard in Miami most recently Dave on Reed cracked that top 20 now remember Music of the Denver Nuggets along with Bruce Brown Lonnie Walker the other king in the NBA with the Lakers Isaiah Longs had a fantastic career here and I expect hell continue to do so and continue to move up that ladder Jordan Miller swatted that pass away Florida a m down 14 at the break lets see if coach mccollums got a little magic here in the second half first and foremost hes got to find a way to get the Rattlers back in at three on the shot clock Tillman driving left hangs and fires and misses tried to get his own offensive rebound nor Chad OMeara Papa hey Transit Transit reel right there fantastic recognition by was that omear threw it ahead oh my goodness yeah a nice feed from omir and Poplar just cocked back starting about the ACC logo and said everybody look out that was a poster shot right there wow yeah somebody got a good shot of that its gonna be on his wall for a long time he is a freak really interesting watching this Miami team early through the first cup of the games Rory because weve talked about the the size differential and the height differential uh theyre going to be crippled in that department a little bit this season but they make up for it like they did all of last season in their early day run with the athleticism the speed yeah I tell you theyve got so many weapons too uh Kyle they can get it from different places and they just get out and they run they amp up the defense and they create create a lot of offense off the defense and theyll theyre going to be in the game all the time as they play that way especially in transition theres a turnover North Channel mirror up the pack he lobs it up four on there probably would love to score more tonight but in that case he gave it up right there and its just a really good teamwork by those guys or Chad OMeara now a perfect eight of eight from the floor 17 points and four rebounds probably hoping he can Corral six more rebounds get himself a double double stuffed the stats sheet a little bit here tonight turn around jumper off the windows good for hats Luis G nice move there a little spin move follow through strong whats up so the next game from Miami a step up in weight class visiting Providence and then playing either Maryland or St Louis Smith Basketball Hall of Fame tipoff tournament in Connecticut this weekend Applause bowel on the floor heres another look at that dog yeah heres Omar with the great recognition and here it is right here Showtime oh my goodness a little like uh Michael Cooper from the Lakers way back when Chase bars the forward for Florida a m made a nice business decision once he got in the paint too because if he went up in an effort to stuff look Poplar it wasnt going to end well so he said go right ahead Ill catch you on the other hand I think he just hopes hes in the background of that picture yeah no kidding yeah turned his back and ducked it took a Uturn there at the last second yep 4532 Miami leads Rattlers picking up the pressure now see if they can get some turnovers up top get some quick buckets they were successful with it early in the first half for a couple of minutes until Miamis settled down yeah thats a sign of a mature team right there Poplar for three things are really kicking for the ticket for the canes right now you know he hammers one home and then he hits it from Deep theres a foul Music theyll get back yeah I think that was just a little cheap push down low so Providence in either Maryland or St Louis cut it up this weekend 19th and 20th this games available on either ESPN news ESPN2 or ESPNU is good for Byron Smith nice shot by Smith very smooth picking up a little token pressure nothing real though Applause Music North Chad putting that perfect streak on the line he misses oh well mere now eight of nine tonight and now Florida a m turns it over nice I need a vape Im gonna bomb one up from three I think he was feeling it he thought that might go as well so Robert could call him not happy with the Rattlers throwing the ball over way too much here tonight theres a whistle a little too much jostling over there on the sideline the referees have kept it pretty tight tonight its been a pretty clean game and part of it is because they have kept on it and kept it tight first half too I had the one time out Music Applause I guess we had the two timeouts followed by Ford a m oh mere misses so omirs now hes ice cold hes over his last still Ice Cold Smith for three no good long hits the deck and thats gonna be a foul thought of that not calling that but he saw he had to because it really affected the transition at the other end 48 34 rebounds for North Shadowmere tell you hes really getting it done tonight and just watching the Hurricanes they have you know three or four guys that could score 30 points on any given night really nice to have that kind of Versatility amongst your team look at Poplar Jordan Miller Bentley Joseph Isaiah Wong and Anthony Walker out there for Miami Smith Chapman Bates bars in Tillman the five on the floor for the Rattlers Miami by 14 15 40 left to play here tonight well get Poplar to the rack high off the glass its good be so opportunistic right he dribbles the ball and once he keeps dribbling until somebody stops him and if nobodys there to stop him hes going all the way lefthanded finish Jordan Chapman in transition one pass one dribble and up the floor come the Rattlers nice transition basketball right there long working on Smith inside he floats and Fades away no good an easy put back for Miller great position by Miller he got snuck inside on the offside and easy bucket for him and now Miller nearly has a takeaway Chase bars was screaming for the basketball down low thought he had a mismatch a mismatch on Jordan Miller but he snuck right around the back of bars and swatted it out of bounds Tariq Issa checks back in for Florida a m career high 13 points for Wooga Poplar here tonight Music theres a takeaway by Jordan Miller in transition and that gets swatted away by Jalen Bates Jordan looking for a foul there lets see if theres contact here yeah maybe kicked him with the right foot a little bit you know you kind of wound up and swatted at the ball usually they do call that Miller was pleading his case with Bill Covington Jr Anthony Walker come up empty again boys having a heck of a time from the field to start his season three air balls here tonight a couple of Threes that didnt get anywhere near the rim so something to work out for walkers Miami heads towards Providence this weekend to Connecticut good matchup good tournament nice early season test for the Kings foul on the floor Isaiah walk with a hole trying to keep it clean again quick trigger Smith wow that was a tough shot elevated knock it home off balance from the freethrow line quick quick trailer obviously done by Byron Smith walk around the Baseline up top for Poplar he fires away rattles in and out Isaiah Wong with the offensive rebound Bentley Joseph will fire away from three ahead he can hit he can hit those threes yeah he cant he hit a few against Lafayette the other night so hes really up I fell asleep there coach Ls not happy about that either Nancy Joseph a 62 sophomore guard out of Arlington Massachusetts a true point guard strong knowledge of how to quarterback his team on the offensive end he is Miamis best defender and he can pressure the basketball long spins in the paint hands it off to Anthony Walker who gets himself a bucket fantastic creative play by Wong he drove hard to the middle pulled up waited on his man to cut hit him right down low fantastic play Applause thank you underneath the bucket is good on the second chance opportunity for Jalen Bates hitting them with a little token pressure here again a little threequarters man Isaiah walk for three is no good comes Florida a m in transition trailing by 15 with 12 30 left to play theres that jump switch a double team up top there and now a running float over the right hand no good for Byron Smith he didnt catch anything Poplar up top for Walker no good Miller for two Music that was a good run the floor for uh for Miller catch that uh follow through followup right there Harlan Beverly and nor Chad OMeara set the check back in for Miami buckets good for Tariq Issa sophomore out of Toronto 10 feet away on the Baseline next whistle Under 12 media timeout never thought about pulling up for a three now hes got to take it away another turnover by Miami in the paint in transition SWAT of the way Tillman trying to go over the left hand here comes Poplar he might have cocked back a little more that time a little more show time right there again created by the defense right Kyle thats really whats going on out here Miamis really amping up the defense of getting some easy buckets at the other end great vision of the Court by the guards boy can he put on a show Tillman driving open man no good Applause we play on Miami leading by 17 now

Forest Music North Carolinas down early but thats in the first half Duke and Kansas is coming up tonight thatll be a fun matchup on ESPN yes it will be another exciting year in the ACC teams will get hot Applause a little chemistry heres the takeaway in transition Bentley Joseph Applause I dont even think he knows hes going to the freethrow line and he is going up strong with the left hand Im not sure lets see the foul here in the face of hotz Louise Gene got him look at that oh my goodness takes it up strong Elevate celebrate weve went wild weve had quite a few dunks here tonight Carl yeah its been interesting been fun yeah any questions coming into the game about Miamis ability to jump and dunk the basketball have uh been silenced three is no good omir in transition and nearly turned it over Bensley Josephs caught up now omir Skies to get the basketball and Nigel Pax got himself an easy bucket or maybe not the second chance opportunity for Jordan Miller is good that was the first dunk of Bentley Josephs career with a 40 thats a good one Kyle take that one all season long Applause Miami continues to show unselfishness on the offensive end its so impressive to watch they really dont care who scores well I think you make a great Point Millers got 16 tonight omirs got the 17 Poplar a careerhigh 15 you asked a majority of the pundits theyre going to say Wong and pack are going to fill up the scoring sheet Miamis going to win long and pack have got to do it Joseph to omir who gets tied up oh look at that Applause the strength by nor Chad omear thank you who was just hanging in the air with his back to the Baseline threw it off the window and got it to go that is sheer strength and a credit to the Miami strength training program here Arlen Beverly in control of the basketball he takes it himself to the rim way too strong that time but anyway back to our conversation here Pax got four Wongs got four now Isaiah Wong has tied a career high with a six assists very very interesting though how its all playing out similar to how these guys went on an elite eight run last year Miami down here in Coral Gables tonight putting on a display of slam dunks one after another tell you theyre clicking tonight first half was a little up and down but they sure are playing right now I mean Nigel pack nearly turned it over once and he does on his second opportunity to throw the ball up the floor to Jordan Miller A little sloppy out of timeout for Miami with 7 30 showing on the game clock here in Miami Omer behind the back pass balls on the deck Miller has it hands it off the pack and the paint slows up over in the corner Harlan Beverly has a smile on his face as he lets it Go Nigel pack has the offensive rebound Bentley Joseph floats with the right hand no good nor Chad OMeara puts it back up in it hes got 21 Kane to make it look easy right now North shadowmeres career high in terms of points hes got a ways to go 35 versus the University of Louisiana Monroe on March the 3rd last season so hes 14 points away in that department he probably wont see the floor a whole lot down the stretch I would imagine last thing you need is an injury absolutely in a game like this and theres an immediate turnover by Florida a m here in transition and Harlan Beverly just got caught up with a rim tried to throw it underneath the north Shadow Mirror but he threw it off FAMU and itll remain Miami basketball 6 42 left to play nice showing here from Miami tonight underneath for Jordan Miller they nearly caught FAMU sleeping again on that same play Nigel pack just tried to bomb one up in the face of Hans Luis Jean and that didnt go all that well for pack Miller hustling back and getting to steal right there Keynes may take a little air out of it not much but a little and thats an offensive foul underneath uh and Bentley Joseph yep cant do that yeah he hugged Jordan Chapman and said come this way as I clear out a little room here in the paint I look like a receiver and a DV right there going at it now Murray are you a Clemson Tiger at heart a Clemson football fan absolutely I dont want to talk too much about the year yet but uh lets go theyre theyre Dabo will get them back theyll get it together theyll regroup theyve had a couple rough games this year how about last year everybody was so down on them but they won 10 games yeah its tough yeah its tough Its a little of the uh Nick Saban Alabama treatment right where you they want you to win every year they want you to win every game and so um but hes done it just an unbelievable job with that program and hell get them back where they need to be Applause when you got drafted to the NBA didnt you also get an NFL try out with the Broncos I actually got drafted by the Broncos in the 12th round after you got drafted in the NBA uh the NFL draft was first so I got drafted by the Broncos in the 12th round and then a month later is when I got drafted by the suns in the third round so yeah so I actually had a chance to to I attended the Broncos mini camp before the NBA draft how was that awesome experience I had a great time it was the last time of the players then well John Elway was the quarterback yeah Louis Wright Steve Watson was one of the big receivers at the time Gary Kubiak was actually the backup wow it was a fun it was a fun experience how long were you there well I was I was there for the mini camp which was about a week and then I came back to get ready for the NBA Draft so Jordan Miller 43 there it is good looking shot yeah weve got a technical foul on Florida a m for flopping you dont see that call very often do you no Applause so one shot for Wong he makes it Music career high nine points for Bentley Joseph here tonight well look at him play defense yes sir on your right and left hip and just will not let go moving those feet always moving those feet Applause thatll be Florida and basketball knocked off the hip of North Shadowmere Kane still playing hardnosed defense its pretty funny Miami had posted a old video on Twitter or Instagram I think I might have seen it on Instagram and all the players were asked what is it that North Channel near says when he gets on the Block and asks for the basketball and what he tells his teammates is baby food baby food hes saying they cant guard me theyre too small give me the basketball interesting you know as an old expost player myself its good to see players who have the mentality of a post player which is I want the ball right youve got to ask for the ball you got to beg for the ball and if you get it you have to produce or the guards arent going to keep coming to you Beverly misses the career Joseph will reset the 15 on the shot clock demands the basketball very confident you have to demand the basketball and you have to be confident in what you can do with it once you catch it facing the basket or back to the basket three on the shot clock bombs away no good for the first time tonight well see a newcomer Christian Watson freshman of Maryland fourstar top 125 recruit checks in for Miami AJ Caseys also going to come into this game he too a premier top 100 recruit in Illinois average 19 points a game in

Watson into the game from Miami two players to keep an eye on Casey in the paint throws it off the glass and its in and good instant impact really good these guys can get some time right get them loosened up and ready for the season Music those are the first two points of AJ Caseys collegiate career and the first of what many people will think will be a ton for the hurricane and AJ Casey now favor iray another big time Prospect for Coach Ellis at the checkin time to take another break our final one here tonight hurricanes lead at 7755 the Young Guns are in when we come back stretch the final three minutes and 15 seconds AJ Casey Christian Watson paper Iran Donald javanovic are all four star prospects Casey and Watson in the top 100 Ivanovich is out due to uh a bit of uh hes got a little sickness going on so hes not in there tonight but who has checked in is jakai Robinson he is a redshirt freshman out of Ossining New York redshirted last season to retain eligibility so hes a fourstar Prospect AJ Caseys a fourstar Prospect so too is Watson and Ira so four fourstar prospects in the game right now with Bentley Joseph itll be fun to watch here theres be a lot of adrenaline on the court you know out on the court getting some time and being excited about trying to make some make some plays out there so those guys are all used to it right theyre used to the big time so lots of Misses both free throws trying to convert on his first Collegiate points Christian Watson an outstanding Run and Jump athlete his size and skill given the flexibility to play multiple positions its good underneath for Peyton Williams so Bensley Joseph will run the point and hell try to get the offense set up and in order in the front court for Miami and Joseph just turned it over Watson hits the deck and thats going to be a foul on Christian Watson a little bit on that play good hustle play Watson uh big boy 67209 added 50 pounds to his power clean and 35 pounds to his bench press between June of this past summer in September so in just a span of a few months between his arrival in September bigger faster and stronger like many of these hurricanes have as AJ Casey pulls down the rebound Music Casey will bomb one away for three and yeah okay heres the deal if you take a look at these guys on the floor theyre all really really good fourstar prospects AJ Casey to me sticks out a little bit Murray he does you can see it right there he uh caught the ball with confidence looked at the looked at the hoop and took a shot and that was it looks very comfortable out there right now very athletic very tall very long Watson just picked up his second foul its pretty neat to see three true freshmen one red shirt freshman and Bentley Joseph a true sophomore on the floor with one another and look I think people will discount this to an extent as okay youve nearly got a 30point lead but this is an opportunity for coachell on this stage in this type of game understanding its a blowout to say you know what were going to give you a little burn here late in a blowout game if you handle yourself accordingly Im looking to find guys I can count on to give me 510 minutes potentially in ACC play if somebody gets in trouble this means something to these guys absolutely it does it shows youre ready it shows youve listened and youve learned what what hes been trying to teach you all year and its an opportunity for you to show yourself and how you handle it under pressure and it absolutely goes toward coach L figuring out who who he can count on to come in Off the Bench when he needs it five on the shot clock Joseph fires away for three Applause he was back pedaling because he knew it was going ahead havent made a ton of three sight theres six of 22 made 13 against UNCG last Friday down with the rebound is Williams three on the way and its good for Jalen Vegas Lord a m will pick up full court Mr Kai Robinson has the basketball Music working on Jordan Chapman a lot of dribbling uses a high screen one minute left to play in Miami here tonight Babylon Bensley Joseph and thatll send Joseph to the line for a oneonone opportunity no I guess that was just the 16th Richard Matthews sophomore guard out of Estero Florida checks in for Florida a m as we wind down here in Miami tonight but Casey thought about a three lefthand dribble and the paint finds the open man Watson for three in the corner its going to tell you what great Court Vision by Casey sleet is tried to take down one of the racks but he found Watson theres that same mentality that all the canes have is that selfishness right theyre looking for the open shot theyre looking to give it to who can score Miami basketball hes going to be a good one hes going to be a good one look at this Marie yep kicks it out to the corner great vision like you said Kyle and Bam wide open and Christian Watson who committed to Miami over Florida Georgetown Illinois LSU Marquette North Carolina State Pittsburgh Rutgers in South Carolina if you would have told Miami Hurricanes fans 12 years ago that Jim larenega is going to have four four stars that are young on his roster not to mention the Isaiah Wongs of the world Nigel pack I dont think people would have believed you Applause if uh you kind of wrote this script and said this is how its going to play out over the course of coachellas first 12 years in Miami its been unbelievable he and his staff deserve a ton of credit and getting the buyin from the players that hes got to come down here to the U absolutely hes built a program here now that as you said players want to come here they want to be a part of the program the final eight last year was huge for them and I think that um hes just going to keep that pipeline going look at that underneath the paper Ira no end of the free throw line you could see Bensley Joseph up here at the logo tell him favor Ira he was whispering to him post up post up he kept telling him to post up just had an opportunity to slam one home but hes got a chance now from the freethrow line Music sophomore trying to help help the Freshman right makes his first his first points is a Miami Hurricane thats favor Ira favouraire freshman center at 611 and 215 pounds another guy Miami in need of some height if you can prove yourself that youre not a liability on the floor its an opportunity absolutely thats one of those things you cant coach right how many times have you heard that you cant coach Heights so if you can get it and use it to your advantage and there we go this ball game is over Coach Ellen the boys win it 8761 your final thoughts here Murray hurricanes came out a little slow again tonight but boy did they turn it on the second half and they look fantastic
