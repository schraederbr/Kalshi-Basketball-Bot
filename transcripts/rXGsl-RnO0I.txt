eight 8 and seven in conference play Florida state is 14 and 12 they are also 8 and seven of the ACC in the NS and the traveling garet have the ball to start our game this is Watkins Clark is on him green is in that starting line up missed the game against Boston College the win at home with a shoulder injury and how about we talked about his shot blocking he can hit that three as well and with his height Tom he can drift out and knock down that three if you Che you got to make sure you close him out and force him to put the ball on the floor Miller has made 21 threepointers this season now with that make and shoots 30 from Beyond The Arc sheflin with the shot clock at 10 for the Tigers in the entry hall trying to back it on down muscle his way do a double and triple team and it didnt stop we talked about the with Watkins and Hall Halls going to be able to get what he wants because he can get deep in that low po you see he was able to gather himself and it basically punish Watkins on that first one second in the league in scoring over 19 points per game for PJ Hall the senior from Spartenburg South Carolina and the ball going back to the Tigers and their head coach in his 13th season Brad Brownell 259 wins on that tiger bench that is the most in school history and across the way one of the legendary coaches in the ACC Leonard Hamilton 418 wins as an ACC head coach and that is fifth all time in the history of The Applause League Tigers wgard wedn the for last you saw Jo had biller on him crafty enough to get by him and finish do they got to make Florida State P another turnover Clark ahead of the Field Green got back that one blocked by Watkins it will be a go tending violation and Tom one of the things that Clark asks for this Clemson team is the athleticism hes one of those guys that gets out in the open floor and you see him be able to come over here and Watkins comes over from the Block a little late great look from right behind the backboard here at Little John Coliseum opened up with 19 6869 season Brian renovated in 2016 a magnificent stage for these ACC players tonight green traving and back to the Tigers another turnover three early ones for the Nos and I think one of the reasons he was forcing that turtle with Chase Hunter is hanging on his HP because with green Jr you know you have to stay with him because hes the best threepoint shooter on this Florida State team so far four points for the ERS off of those turnovers for Leonard Hamiltons team early in the first half Paul the entry knocked away Corin got in the passing Lane Worleys pass along the Baseline Miller couldnt save it early turnovers for Leonard Hamiltons team normally theyre the one that forces you out of the action Clemson doing a good job of being able to force them out of their first and second options ns are 14 and 12 quite a turnaround from last year they struggled to a 9 and 23 record and seven and 13 in conference play this the final game of the night on the Slate in the ACC on this Saturday just a couple of weeks to go the regular season on our way to Washington DC and that one is a turnover against Gerard pleading his case and his second turnover for the Tigers I thought it interesting when we talked with Brad Barnell he was talking about how physical Florida state is and how they will try to limit your actions that last time Joe Gerard being forcing that turnover Florida State goes very deep on that bench coach barell well aware of that they dominated the boards in their win in Tallahassee in the regular season first meeting between the teams shot clock is at 10 green catching release and a foul on the glass Clark came over the top and the foul goes against PJ Hall of Clemson his first so Hall is going to step aside hell get an early breather Godfrey comes in for Hall her Smith Tommy Morris Jamal Spearman in charge of the action this evening two and A2 minutes without points turn around Watkins and the drop will continue for Florida State Miller is behind the play pass to Godfrey Watkins came away with it good defense transition by Watkins Watkins onean show all the way to the rim determined to score and thats one of the things that he does because again he can put the ball on the floor go Coast to Coast does not shy away from being able to make the contact and finish right at the cup he is the transfer from Virginia Commonwealth was part of an A10 tournament championship team a season ago Hunter for three that rims out shefflin couldnt get to it and Watkins is all over the court Brian and hes a do everything player for this Florida State team because again we get Nifty lay right there could come up with it was able to get by sheflin theres a big Collision Corin and Chase Hunter the foul goes against Corin his first first for Florida State he thats one of the things for Clemson theyre going to have to deal with the physicality of Florida state from one to five they will switch out on everything theyll get up and even try to limit you in transition at last time Chase Hunter AB opening that contact drawing the foul Tiger shot 53 of their win Wednesday at Georgia Tech in Atlanta shein in deep needs a safety valve long arms of Miller intercepting the pass defle from this Florida State team again with their Le those L this is cor against Godfrey working on the Baseline Miller difficult shot and he got it to go B Miller earlier knocking down the three that last time realized he had a smaller chefin on him and just got to the Lane so Miller has five of The Seven Points so far for Florida State and a onepoint lead on the road knocked away from Gerard he recovers tried to get Watkins in the air he did and will go to the free throw line so when we come back Joe Gerard the top free throw shooter in the ACC will be at the free throw line its the NOS by one CW Courtside Saturday this Sunday the finale of CW womens Hoops ends with a bang oh my goodness when

South Carolina the Tigers 20th in Tallahassee in their first meeting 7867 theyre taking a look at this go tending that was Watkins who got back on the drive by Clark and now Jamal spearmans coming over to talk to Brian so Brian whats the uh the update on the situation actually we saw right there the timing of it that go ending was actually a a good block cuz I was questioning myself when we saw it okay so now Im assuming theyre going to take the two points off they have it is now 74 based on that replay the ball had not hit the backboard and then Watkins made contact with it before it hit the board yeah once they slowed it down it showed that he timed it perfectly and came up with a good block and so the points come off of the total for Clark free throw is good or as from the new movie Kung Fu Panda 4 might say scoo dont miss Kung Fu Panda 4 only in theaters March Applause 8th so is that a SC double scoo so Im basically Im just going instead of a swish or swo hey thats not bad that could catch on it has I like it dont see Kung Fu Panda four so Gerard has a couple of free throws not surprising 88 for his career in the ACC from the free throw line fourth all time some Brian Oliver numbers there Beetle got it back hes into the lineup as a substitution for the Tigers it pops up and he grabs it Florida State B security is such good pass did a great job of probing realizing he drew two FL State Defenders got it over to gy and gy is one of those guys anything around the up on a pogo stick Five Points of four boards in the win at Georgia Tech for Gody hes got a jam early in this one all the way to the rim Watkins again and its so what makes him so good Tom is the fact that he gets downhill and hes able to alter his body after the contact and finish so Watkins has Applause four Beetle Ball B on him got a piece of that but also got a piece of be Applause so Taylor Bowen has the foul for Florida State and watch be on a nice little pocket pass as B bow and came over come over and then Bach Watkins watch how he comes absorbs the contact with sheflin be able to alter his body and finish one of those things hes one of the best finishers in the in the conference coming off a double double Brian in the victory at home against Boston College this week for Watkins as Beetle has the first Watkins two and 11 Wiggins in shefflin out for the Tigers Chandler Jackson comes into the game green trots out to the Leonard Hamilton bench Jackson had a huge night in that win against Boston College hes one of those guys too atic guard stocky you know a lot of Le H Hamiltons players you know Pride themselves on trying to get down hson so far has done a good job of keeping the perimeter guys underlock Beetle gives the Tigers a onepoint lead for the moment the shot will not count foul on the floor its Joe Gerard and his first for the veteran player and transfer from transfer from Syracuse Chase Hunter back in Gerard takes a seat for Gerard so Hall and Gerard right both sitting for Brad brell Watkins behind the line he able to chase his own got it away before he hit the floor warley lot of dribbling gy wants that ball underneath they cant find him they go to Jackson thats for on the weak side yeah Florida state is not one of the better threepoint shooting teams you dont have green on the floor and if youre Clemson you want to DARE them to shoot that three NOS are just one of five so far on three pointers that was Godfrey near the rim not quite enough Brian youre right 32 this season 12 in the conference from threepoint distance for Florida State B Bowen High arching attempt Mark Beetle trying to chase it down in a race with Bowen foul coming up against Florida State you see plays we call these the 5050 balls you see old bowling coming down and you see Beetle there going forward we talked about how important this game is both teams angling to have some separation youre getting the gut of the season games like this will definitely matter early on the Tigers were three of six from the field they are one of the better shooting teams in the conference bran third in the ACC 47 as a team and now Primo Spears will come in for Florida State we havent seen PJ hall or Ian sheflin knock down threes but against Georgia Tech both of the bigs were able to step out and shoot the lights out of it and and that Tigers win against the yellow jackets they made 14 threepointers as a team shot 48 from Beyond The Arc and one by 24 against the yellow jackets got Frey the entry double team Jackson and Miller combining was a foul call good defense down there by Jackson Clemson doing a good job of understanding that Florida States going to switch all of the pick and rols being able to have the bigs take the guards down on punish them thats some thats a must Godfrey did a good job of being able to seal Jackson first foul on Jackson Scott just 50 from the line this season I knew that but I gave Im going to wear that out tonight I mean sophomore from Swani Georgia came off the bench to score five points four rebounds 22 minutes of action against Georgia and now as a team the Tigers six of six from the free throw line Corin midrange too much jaon defense collapsed on him in the form of Wiggins shot clock is down to four Spears must shoot just barely got it away did not hit the rim shot clock violation Florida State Tom one of the things that stood up for me so far is that Clemsons been able to match the physicality that Florida State normally overwhelms teams with because they are not allowing them to get into the paint and theyre limited to only one shot in fact the NES have missed their last five shots and overall one of their last seven from the floor for the noes trailing 129 approaching the 12 minute Mark is H right down Broadway to bend that rim and one of the does is that theyre spreading out their offense Clon I mean Florida State wants to get up onum pressure that last time Chase Hunter Blow by finishes nice at the rim with the dunk his first two points of the night creates the steal gets it back teas up the three cant convert so Godfrey had the position Brian and the foul is going against Florida State and basically you see Chase Hunter going to finish at The Rim coming up so far its been all Clemson 50 shooting from the floor for the Tigers so far in the first half with 1146 to go and the 149 lead on their home floor for Clemson lets take a look at whats going on around the ACC presented by team mobile look at Wake Forest at home with the win over number eight Duke Bryan a huge win for Wake Forest I mean they basically have tortured other teams at home thats a huge quad one win for them and then how about that lowc scoring Rock fight between North Carolina and Virginia North Carolina had not won in Charlottesville since 2012 and they get the win against the Cavaliers a lot of projections about who will be in the NCAA tournament five teams from the conference win a season ago we is that big win for North Carolina State and I saw your your Alma Mar Syracuse taking down the Irish a little closer than they might have liked since they had a a large lead in that one on Jim beheim day thatll fall Applause Wiggs NC state was the team that last Saturday came here and scored a onepoint win on the Tigers home floor then on the road and won at Georgia Tech during the week as Clemson has extended this lead to seven for State got to find some way to be able to penetrate that Clemson defense because again we talked about the fact that you know theyre Florida States not one of the better threepoint shooting teams as you see PJ Hall come in for Godfrey they got to find a way to be able to get downhill and get some points in the Music paint Spears okay on Q then I guess Spears comes in knocks that three down and again way he was able to get that open is that Florida state did a good job of being able to shift for the Clemson defense although he is a double digit scorer on average Spears had only scored 13 points in his last four games but hes got the three not his specialty but a much needed bucket for the NOS T the shot clock for Beetle quick glance to the rim and a foul Dylan Hunter driving and creating contact the Clemson guards are doing a good job once they have the bigs from Florida State switched out of putting their head down and getting to the rim weve seen that on multiple occasions either being able to score or Draw the contact so Dylan Hunter the sophomore and younger brother of Chase Hunter at the free throw line 36 from the strike on a lot of fre free throw attempts five of 14 total for the year its finally here the highly anticipated new season of the CWs number one show allame premieres Monday April 1st from the sidelines to the streets they are leaving it all on the field Monday April 1 87 Central only on the CW allame one of two for Dylan Hunter impressive for Clemson up five already with just a little bit more than 10 point 10 minutes to go and comb nein Hall only two points Tigers now seven of eight from the free throw line after the hunter Miss Spears just made a three deep into the shot clock with a spin Spears oh nice move by spe Spears literally got Dylan Hunter going One Direction spin got a little separation hes come off the bench Thea Hamiltons giv him a Five Points Junior from Hartford Connecticut a transfer from Georgetown and Kane in his first year in the Florida state program we are going the other direction Spears on both ends of the floor tom last time forcing PJ Hall into that offensive foul thats two on hall right now so Godfrey is over at the scor Applause Music table as you mentioned Brian Hall with just the two points right now he is the leading scorer this season for the Tigers over 19 points per game for the senior from sparten Corin Wiggins and Hall theyll have a little conversation try to get on the same page after fumbling it out of bounds a Miss communication between Wiggins and Hall a lot of times if youre going up and you see PJ Hall go out again with those two Music fouls Spears drawing a little bit more defensive attention after the last two trips down the floor that pass cor couldnt handle it right to Wiggins thats now seven turnovers in the first half of Florida State deflected by Watkins a dangerous pass by Dylan Hunter especially against the length of the Florida State team done a good job pretty much turning Florida State over you see Joe Gerard come in so Gerard is back in the hunter Brothers got fre and Wiggins for the Tigers its going to be warley first off warley it seems like Brad Bernell is committed to his guards Breaking Down The Bigs from Florida state every chance they get Dyan Hunter back to the free throw line for the Tigers in the bonus here with 19 910 to go here in our first half by the way Brian Florida state has not been to the free throw line in the game so far the tigers are eight of nine they did not need free throws in the win at Georgia Tech on Wednesday just five for seven from the strike as we mentioned they made 14 threepointers again they are solid from the free throw line we told you theyre one of the better free throw shooting teams CLK of The Game Hunter to the bench and now nine of 10 for free throws for Clemson green junor back into the game obviously we talked about him his threepoint shooting ability Florida State feel like they have to try to go back to getting their guards post up that Balls available and loose and taken by the Tigers and Hunter drops it off to Gerard quick release Godfrey in a crowd second effort what work by number 10 and the flex Godfrey again PJ Hall has been saddled with fouls Godfrey Has Come Off the Bench and its giving them that inside presence and that sense of energy six points now for Godfrey warley a runner and he floats it home and nice Runner by Worley again you know for Florida State theyre going to try to extend theyre trying to create some chaos Clemsons done a very good job so far of taking care of the ball and not allowing the pressure from Florida State to open up fast break opportunities Gerard its stepping back for three and hes ripping the ropes for the Tigers Joe Gerard hes done a good job of being able to manage when to try to penetrate hes one of those guys too one of the tops in the league at threepoint shots hes now made 79 three pointers fourth in the conference tigers do it on the defensive end all the way across the Clark has the daylight not the Applause range Applause green Hunter on his hip got the bounce and it was fall Brian and to finish with the left again when you see Joe Gerard and you put your hands down a little step back hes going to make you pay so far its been all Clemson in the first half March 2nd the CW is the home of live golf every brought to you by ran trucks built to serve game two of CW Courtside Saturday many of you saw pit get a home win 7964 against Virginia Tech Hinson led the way with 22 points Brad brownells team has the first half lead with 736 to go PJ Hall the middle there has a couple of fouls already in this first half so he spent a lot of the time on the bench in fact Halls only played 4 and A2 minutes so far BR I feel like rjy has come in set the tone for the kind of f in the gaps and again also Jo Gerard I think that he has basically come in and done a good job of being able to navigate the Florida state Tempo and aggressive defense seven points for Gerard leads the way for the Tigers in the first half five points for Miller and Spears completed threepoint play Florida state has not gone to the free throw line a lot and you would think that the way that Clemsons been able to execute lead would be a lot larger I mean only five points still feel like you know if youre Florida State you stay with your defense the things that they thrive on are getting deflections and getting the transition that was their first free throw of the game and then on the driving Gerard maneuver foul on warley his second so one of the brilliant things that Jo Gerard has done is that how aggressive that Florida state has been hes been able to be aggressive because again when you have guys that are there trying to get all up in your kitchen so the speak put the pressure on them try to get by look at that third nationally 94 at 94 why are they making him shoot just go ahead and give him two its a play off speed up the game a Speed the game man lets go ahead and give him two eight points now for Gerard hit the he doesnt probably like that hes going to put up free throw after the game n points now for Gerard two of three from the floor includes one threepointer love to see Watkins get going because again hes a guy lot of different opportuni you see the little Step by by Green Jun figh WIS the SC Gerard got tangled up with a couple of Florida State Defenders and green away with it Gerards behind the this is Spears Watkins offensive glass trying to go up with it Godfrey was the closest Defender ball went out of bounds but thats what lonard Hamilton wants to do wants to get the deflection get out in and last time you got Spears with a wide open shots keep it Watkins 640 and rolling in the first half Florida state will maintain possession good flash by by iin that last time on green coming out they want to give him a clear look nlls have been crashing the glass on the offensive end seven rebound so far from Florida State Watkins shot clocking right into shefin contact there and Watkins through the free throw line shefin picks up his first personal foul and thats what you saw from Florida State ear in the game because Watkins again see him initiate the contact shefin should have stayed straight up anytime you extend over then youre going to get called for the foul 80 from the line for the season for jir Watkins redir J from Trenton New Jersey at the free throw Applause line got the soft bounce bran is last four games from Watkins averaging 21 points per game hes got five so far tonight two of five from the floor and three rebounds and thats how Florida States going to get back in theyve got to find a way to generate some turnovers spr Crimson out put the ball on the and to get down to Applause the so Watkins makes it a fivepoint gain tigers by as many as in the first half Godfrey gy guards him Applause tried entry KCK from Spears so the reset to 20 on the shot five Spears the transfer from Georgetown and du Kane conspiracy hes feisty that last time wi tried to get position on him and he out fought him got around him where they couldnt take advantage of that mismatch and even now hes still guarding Gerard yeah Gerard just left the game for Clemson as its leading scorer with nine points Beetle tring to drive his man down the lane Beetle popped to the rim maybe deserved a better fate after all that work and that pass right to thats going to frustrate L Hamilton because you havent had many opportunities to get in transition that last time miscommunication thats how about Brad brono coach youre open shoot it shoot it nine turnovers in the first half coach brell played at the Paul University in Indiana 1991 grad Wiggins B the rebound the outet Watkins on Tuesday at home sto aame Los streak for the seminal Music theimer Watkins trying to get around Gody defensively great defense by Godfrey staying vertical tiger on the man what a finish by Beetle there good move contact should have possibly been a hand one Beetles got four points above a season average of 32 per game and a timeout taken by Florida State watch the good defense by Godfrey comes up and blocks the shoing in watch this acrobatic finish by beo goes in absorbs the contact looks like Tom wormy over at the Y on Thursday how did he get that pass b b up on the rim he had a little Nifty miss you tell me man I saw you sometimes you you be at the Y with the not like that what a move by Josh Beetle the red shirt sophomore from Columbia South Carolina well dive into the nations most shocking Mysteries catch all new episodes of The CW original true crime series crime Nation Tuesdays 87 Central only on the CW back inside Little John Coliseum so glad that youre with us for CW Courtside Saturday game two Tom wory Brian Oliver and our outstanding ACC basketball production crew with you from Tiger toown Im sure if you had mentioned to Brad Barnell that you know youd have PJ Hall on the on the bench with two fouls and he and Ian she sheflin would combine for two points and youd be up with seven points I think he probably laugh at us but Florida States got to take advantage of staying with what theyve been doing continue to run their offense and try to get the ball down low thats what theyre doing here with Corin not the desired result so Godfrey who had that defensive play just a moment ago at the other end couple of blocks six points three rebounds hes come in and contributed for PJ Hall with the two personals had it Stripped Away second effort got it back and Godfrey has earned some free throw and godre sticking with it I like the fact they little pick and roll action with he and Chase Hunter they have to honor that watch the pick and roll again you got Baba Miller out here guarding Chase Hunter Godfrey comes in you see Primo Spears comes over Godfrey not giving up on it again hes been huge in this first half with PJ Hall on on the bench with two fouls Corin picked up his second personal for Florida State hes up to seven points now Hall still on that bench Deonte green comes in number five for the nolles a smaller line up on for Florida State again its been all Clemson in this first half if youre L at Hamilton got to find a way to generate some offense how about Gody a 50 free throw shooter hes made all four free throws tonight and hes definitely stepped up both the Flor Florida State shooting just 33 as a team in the first half as we CL in on theut threshold Spears had Clark defending him and Clark might have picked up the person first on Jack Clark hes the transfer from NC State Chandler is back in green leaves so Spears is at the free throw line 75 on the season from the line for Applause Spears Spears is coming in and giving this Florida State team you know a lift offensively they struggled early some offense but hes been really active on both both ends of the floor he missed the first gameing that NC transfer waer got it seeing action in his 18th game in a SEAL uniform and Spears converts both free throws fact Florida state has not missed the free throw so far they are five for five from the free throw line second to last of the conference as a team from the line you wouldnt know it and heres the steel Spears spear Spears again I mentioned the fact that how Florida States going to get back in this game active hands get out and transition Florida State tries to get in active hands Primo Spears comes up with the steal tries to allow them to get back in the game active finish for the

union of fruity sweet gummy and tangy crunchy nerds nerds gummy clusters unleash your senses all right Ill see lets take a look at our Pacific Life game summary presented by Pacific Life creating Financial Security for more than 150 years and and again we talked about the fact that right now Hall and she combine points but its been the Clemson bench thats basically showed up and showed out tonight already 17 points in this first half and its been a combination of a lot of different players its going RJ G gy Josh Beetle and also Wiggins but if youre PJ Hall you cant wait to get back in there but if youre brell you have to be very very happy with how your bench is stepped up tonight just four and A2 minutes of action in the first half for PJ Hall leading scorer for the Tigers 19 Point per game sheins close to 10 points per game so without those scores the tigers are up by five for the moment Spears at the line but heres the thing but Ive been in positions where PJ Hall is this is a huge game you want to play hard you want to get the win stay engaged stay engaged ride it out your bench has been playing well and then come back in the second half locked and loaded ready to go so Spears with that last free throw gets the double digits with 10 points play to get there so far in our game in this first half inside of three and a half minutes remaining that shot by Clark comes up short Spears the rebound youve seen a little bit of a shift for Florida State being a to play a little bit more aggressive limit Clemson to one and done get out in early transition and its the the Steals and the deflections that have really allowed them to get back into this game eighth turnover of the half for the Tigers theide Clark volleyballs it out to Applause Spears Watkins like Watkins he basically bailed out Chase Hunter hes been able to get to the cup and kind of bully him a little bit that was a little bit of a bailout wigin she keeps it alive his fifth rebound of the game Wiggins on the Block against Miller the double comes from Jackson Hunter Applause releases Applause H Applause nowon is one of their last seven from the floor Lane Clark able to run it down to the Applause corner Hunter the stutter step in the drop low to shefin series of moves not able to take advantage of the mismatches down L still keeping that door wide open for Florida State for the they go inside with Watkins and again Watkins can get that especially with the smaller be able to get down he can use his physicality be offset that again if theyre going to get back into the game its got to be more Watkins put the ball in the floor tigers are two of eight from Beyond the AR Hunter and Gerard have those Applause two being easy lay first basket for tonight with 10 points over nine rebounds third in the conference trying to defend green inside got a piece good defense by Ian relling to his team open wide Tigers four their last five games three in a row on the road to Georgia Tech seus at North Carolina that historic win second time for the Clemson to win in Chap Hill at the time North Carolina was number three in the Applause nation final 23 seconds opportunity for either Watkins or spears to get downhill butet offense this is Spears Che another rebound final 10 seconds dont forget the Subaru halftime report coming up recap from game one around the league and highlights and stats will Applause by second against the seals at home won both of the meetings in the regular season last year the Tigers made it to the semis of the ACC tournament a season ago lost to Virginia beat NC State in the quarterfinals ready to crank up the second 20 minutes from Little John Coliseum Tom Ive always looked at the first five minutes of the second have as being critical for both teams if youre Clemson keep doing what youre doing try to establish PJ Hall and if youre Florida State you had some good moments where you were able to turn Clemson over and get downhill and fast break remember Hunter made that threepointer right before the horn to end the first half for the Tigers shot clock is at 10 for Hunter Miller defending hell step back ball ends up with Baba Miller what a pass to block by PJ wall Hall then Hall came Music in watch the pass by Baba Miller and you see PJ Hall come over and get warley shot good recovery because it looked like it was an easy one PJ Hall again throwing caution to the win playing with those two fouls its five blocks as a team for the Tigers in the game faving to thee Watkins trying to get by Clark shot clock at as he falls away and misses good defensive possession by Jack clar not not falling for the contact on that separation forcing a tough two shooting in the first half for Florida State tigers Three of nine on threepointers Hunter had two of them hell drive this time off the back iron and an unkind result at Miller on the he oh man nice move bring that with the guard skills brings it down and then a little spin to finish and thats why lard Hamilton and his group is so excited about Baba Miller his skill set 611 sophomore now with seven points from mayca Spain Gerard extending the range green has it three consecutive good defense possessions by Florida State have to be able to capitalize of bounds and it stays with the NS watch the skill of this last play by babill he comes in and he says Joe see you later and then you know what jump find out if you want to watch this this is 611 folks being able to go and spin and then finish at The Rim warley Watkins Baseline looking for that Rim I think thats three on PJ hall Hall was the defender and that will be his third again Watch Watkins go in PJ Hall on the rotation goes up like he got got him across the arm such a competitor just cant help himself hes not going to allow Watkins to have an uncontested Jam absolutely and again if youre PJ Hall you got to be frustrated because again not being able to get any type of Rhythm stilling his on the throw Lane has to go to the bench comes Gody extended minutes Joe Gerard goes over and gives PJ Hall a little bit of encouragement you see Brad Barnell over there telling him you know he needs to stay engaged because again a lot of frustration because he hasnt been able to put his in on this game still a lot of game left nine points now for Watkins Florida State being able to extend their pressure slowly cutting into that lead down seven Tigers coming off the 24o win Wednesday at Georgia Tech shot clock inside of 10 they dump ity the and heres the thing they went four out with one in and then Godfrey did a good job of being able to Seal Co and basically when he goes up I told you hes got that little go go gadget pogo stick with him finishes up with the dunp 10 points now for Godfrey well above his season aage 62 is shein reels that one in hes got eight boards Gerard back to Clark This is for three green trying to save it and it was really the work by she to come over the top and not foul and its tiger ball and again watch the seal down there by Godfrey get call on his back hand and again weve talked anything around the rim you can go ahead and cancel Christmas does a good job of the seal you know what green junor decides you know what Im going to make a business decision and let you have that one dont cancel Christmas Brian please Music Gerard unable to deliver tap back out Hunter just inside the line and heres the thing Clark made that play come up with the offensive possession Chase Hunter didnt settle for the three gets in elevates in the midrange so now Hunter and Godfrey have 10 points a piece and lead the way for the Tigers Miller trying to connect with G goes out of bounds and well keep it at this end of the floor so the 11point lead right now for the Tigers their largest of the evening led by 10 at Applause halftime Watkins against two Defenders could not be stopped and nice nice play by Watkins again love the isolation for them as you see Gerard come up he puts a lot of pressure on the defense because he constantly in motion Applause Watkins thomase Gerard and how he he is because Florida state is constantly switching that last time bab Miller got caught he he passed underneath Jo only needs a second to get that three up 377 career three who rocks the rim goes to the upper upper level Gerard Applause again heres the thing you dont give Florida State enough time to celebrate the dunk and Joe Gerard is coming back at you you know that this is the guy you cant give too much daylight green for and that bounce out of bounds what a sequence between both of the team and its all been Joe Gerard again Joe Gerard was like you know what you SC Im going to see you two with a three its all Clemson baby we RAM and when trucks are what you do you do truck month leads the way with 15 points heres the thing is that hes done a massal job of being able to navigate this Florida State Defense and theres no secret that if you dont get to him he gets going hes like you know what Dave time no its Joe Joe Gerard time baby you see his numbers 15 points three for six and perfect from the free throw line Basics the graduate student from Glen Falls New York after four years at Syracuse and tonight Brian he plays his 152nd while PJ Hall is on that tiger bench with his fouls and Tom we spoke in the pregame to Brad brell about the physicality of the guards and how would Joe Gerard handle that I think that he been able to understand when to get them in their offense when to get the blow by and hes so active you have to be committed to him because again you leave him open and then you might as well go ahead and just say chalk up three because hes in a nice little rhythm got three threes in the game 15 ding over the top misses Clark stolen backley on the work to Watkins G doesnt get the bounce the tip Miller got TI up with shefin still a lot of basketball left to go Florida State down by 13 theyve done some periodically good moves as far as trying to get down low and come up with some offensive glass Clark leaves the game for Clemson picked up his second may not show it in in in the score but Clark has done a really good job he hadnt scored yet but I think his defense and offensive rebound has been key for Clemson this is Worley around shein nice move byley hes points theame JY Jor from Philadelphia Pennsylvania Hunter how did he do it Chase Hunter again I think that Clemson guards have done a great job gra Rell has basically told them that when you get the bigs from Florida State on you separate a little bit and go for the blow and again realize hes got a big on there absorbs that contact a little Up Up and Under nice move by Chase absorbs that contact throws it up Im almost want to give him a sco for that one Chase is like oh give it to me baby looking for the love from the student section talk about about the game that Joe Gerard has had but you look at the game for Chase Hunter 12 points 13 points efficient five for n from the field above an a of 123 points per game for the red from Atlanta Georgia in West Lake High School see Clemson showing a little Zone Action right now if your Florida State you want to try to penetrate that zone dont settle for three get inside out spear the cutter Watkins called the foul before the shot even though that that play didnt go I love flashing Spears backside cut by Watkins Hunter picked up his second personal Bowen collapsing on Spears got free looking for Wiggins On The Run sent it back out sheing up a three Watkins for the Applause NOS talked about Chandler he has not scored in theame so tonight for Florida State Clon doing a good job of packing the paint understand that other than green not many great threepoint shoters Spears halfway down and Applause out to Dylan Hunter he challenges the defense it by I to realize that they had the numbers you had four on two no commitment to stop the ball continues to go downhill Florida States got to be careful right now all Clems as far as momentum right now and up by 16 larg lead of the night for the Tigers Spears one of the two in double digits for weak side Watkins hes got 11 points good board there to keep the possession alive let Dyan Hunter go over the top good to see that everybodys fine after that sequence so first on Dy Hunter Dan gy will go to the bench Chase Hunter comes out Joe Gerard back in 15 points for Gerard one of three Tigers to score a double digit so far tonight Watkins launching a three ball big basket by Watkins to calm this Clemson crowd down because again like get out of hand cut it down to 13 you want to continue to try to chip away at it his first three and 14 points Watkins and shoot 35 of Theon for Watkins now on the defensive end D on knocked Away by Corin shein recovers work on the perimeter they throw it away Spears went one way the ball went the other direction towards the Florida state bench and their 10th turnover of the game tigers by 13 your court side Saturday 7964 against Virginia Tech the Panthers are now 18 and n on the season Gerard inside Hunter to pump fake in the kick CL we side and out good defensive possession by Florida State coming out of timeout going into a Zone got to find a way to put some points on the board doing a good job of being able to lock down that paint inside Corin got free fou cor of the free throw line for Florida State and Great Seal by cor he was able to get Godfree right but beneath him and watch again cor does a good job of get inside there good delivery by appear hes able to go over absorb the contact for an and one one guy that has been relatively quiet this evening third foul of Gody hes for the Applause Tigers Godfrey trying to establish position inside cor and guarding is at five for Gerard and it knocked away needs to he it got it away will not hit the rim and a shot violation B A under 11 minutes you cut this thing down to 11 see PJ Hall come in Hunter leaves the game for the Tigers if you told Coach brell prior to the game Hall will have two points chein will have too with 10 and2 minutes to go in the second half I dont know that he would think hed be ahead by this margin he probably think that you and I were in the media room sipping on some juice Hunter the dve able to SW it out of bounds B Bowen not giving up on the play on the chase down you see Chase Hunter going in and B Bowen comes in with that length I mean this young freshman has tremendous amount of talent his his athleticism in size can play on the outside and very athletic just left the lineup for Florida State going a little too aggressive out there Gody Ive really been impress with Godfrey and what he done and how he stepped up we talked about PJ Hall being in foul trouble andan chein not having a huge line off Tigers two of seven on three pointers in the second they both belong to Gerard Hunter had it halfway down Clark somehow got it and then cor deflected it and here com Spears joins the not high on the sare should have Tak another dribble right there with balance but already anticipated the contact thats one of those youve got to be able to finish and capitalize youre not getting any opportunities to go fast break about CLK now with n rebounds in the game for the Tigers Chase Hunter has nowhere to go Dy got double poked Away by Applause foul def is rebounding I mean those are the things thats probably not going to show up on the night Jackson picked up the foul he has also not scored in the game Brian God free full stretch out to Gerard straight away right the Hunter reload thats what we call for because again you cannot give Joe Gerard an opportunity to do that give him a chance go ahead and get those seals those threads hes had a huge game another three for Gerard Miller off the glass for Millers got nine on four five shooting has 18 that leads all scores and he is four of eight on threepoint attempts coach barell talked about leadership and Po from Gerard and interior Off the Bench fromy gy is W that that that match up between he and Cohen again he has been a beast down low 12 points for Godfrey sophomore coming off the bench green hell hit that jumper inside the line and Nice Shot by Green Clark did a good job of chasing him off that threepoint line so five points for green now warley is going to check in for Florida State ACC Legend Leonard Hamilton looking on heres the thing for Florida St again you extend your pressure you do know that there have been times where youve been able to use your athleticism and get deflections you want to get back into this game by getting some easy buckets but again for Clemson you run your stuff you continue to spread them out Florida State right now dropped off into a m kind of a Zone a matchup zone Green hit the deck Hunter looking for the entry hall demands it gets it to Godfrey traveling you see gy a little bit of a Texas twep there so Florida state will have the basketball when we come back the Tigers have the lead on their home court Applause 5846 points coming off the bench four five from the floor hasnt missed the free throw attempt as well and hes had to play quite a bit tonight because PJ Hall foul trouble for the vast majority of this game yeah you look at both teams I think pretty much equal with 24 point 26 points in the paint but like you said its been the bench for Clemson out scoring Florida State 232 Godfrey has played close to 22 minutes tonight coming off of that Clemson bench right now hes getting a breather 5846 I will say the ns are hanging around Brian yeah they are and theyve shown that theyve been able to string together a couple St they just got to be able to convert on the other end got to find some way to get some points because Clemson doing a better job of shutting it down seear right through the lane I think it was Hall who contested the shot it was and he went but he went vertical though went vertical good shot by Spears still a bold decision with those three personal fouls for PJ Hall so Spears has the bucket hes got 12 in the game Florida State chipping away at this thing you see for Clemson some clock clock is your friend that clock is down to five Gerard inside against Corin and Corin just H his ground he did I thought that shefin should have gone up with the initial I think that the pause is what put him in a bad position nice pass over the cor and you see Primo Spears has come in Florida State still willing away this is a good game here now 58 all of a sudden this is an the back deflected and then diving for it along with Dyan Hunter and if youre green Jun you dont have to do that watch this last pass by Primo Spears FSU Florida State on a 60 run its the ball over the Corn What looked like Clemsons going to run away with this thing Florida state has been able to play solid defense and get a couple of buckets to go its a very similar scenario to last Saturday in this building we were here for the second game of CW court side Saturdays built a doubleit lead in the second half and DJ horn and ncate came back to win by a point but you know where Florida state is this one of the better teams as far as creating deflections and then they want to play play fast and get downhill so for Clemson been a little bothered by this matchup Zone by Florida State you got to continue to move the ball try to go inside out for them to have to help and Rec Florida state has eight Ste they are second best of the accon in Ste that be aor down the stretch Gerard with the shot fivey dribble lost the Handley Spears elev oh good block oh CL came out of nowhere oh my God Jack Clark well looked to be an easy twoo what looks like to be easy when Jack Clark comes out and says you have been denied you shall not pass seven blocks in the game as a team for the Tigers just two for the N so Applause far Miller Miller showing the range weve seen on multiple occasions his ability at 611 to put the ball on the floor and finish and then almost a little bit of NBA range Florida state has cut this game down to five it is a 90 run over the last two and a half minutes for the Florida state seal C by the three by Miller Gerard cannot answer green runs it down now green is really the threepoint specialist on this team Brian and he launches one hits front rim thats Watkins flying in Watkins off the glass doesnt get the roll G was near it has it good good possession right there by Florida State because again it seemed like a little wi oh my God Chase Hunter says he goes up to the upper level youre not going to guard me so I will go ahead and put this down and show you what Im working with a little bounce 15 points for Hunter thats got to be four I think thats PJ PJ Hall help side Music maybe they call again you see Chase Hunter basically the sky just open wide open for him and again shows off his bunnies no one comes over Im going to go ahead and put the flush on that one talk about Joe Gerard but Chase Hunter has had an a great evening as well so that last foul was assessed to shefin oh okay heres third so Watkins at the free throw line sevenpoint game sco jir Watkins really channeling his iner Dragon Warrior and for more excitement see Kung Fu Panda 4 only in theaters March 8th I used to be an avid fan of going to watch Kung Fu Panda but now Ive got a teenager that doesnt thats cool and the bad thing about it I still want to go lets go everybody get to there its going to be really awkward me sitting up in the theater by myself with no kid two free throws from Watkins the defense by Florida state has allowed them to be able to get back into this game Florida for for Clemson maintain your composure you dont want to run so much clock to the point where you kind of take away from being aggressive but thats a guy that will put it up if he gets a chance and Watkins both hit the deck off with a Miss by Gerard so they gave it to Miller his second foul Chase Hunter on the inbounds fivepoint game tigers have made by as many as 16 this half shot clock is at five for Hall backing in onj h PJ Hall fired up because again its been a rough evening for him saddle with fouls Florida State obiously not send someone PJ Hall said Im going gohe and bully you you see you sh he can finish at The Rim again PJ Hall letting the fans hear it flexing on him like popey with his spinach how about that match up PJ Hall 610 238 jayen gainy 610 220 thats an old SCH PJ Hall with five points and the lead is back up to eight for the Tigers Watkins around the edge Watkins to the baskets and thats one of those things if youre Ian shefflin you cant allow Watkins to get downhill to his right hand Watkins does a good job of being able to finish watch him turn around hes got Ian shefflin backp and it looks like that may be four fouls again good downhill move we talk about playing through the contact shein now with four and the biggest foul Jeopardy for the Tigers so Wiggins will come in for she still plenty time left to go in this game just a little bit more than four minutes opportunity for Florida State to cut this lead down to five two points and nine boards for she as he goes to the Brad Brown bench Watkins is at the free throw line five of six from the Applause strike looking for a threepoint play of his own Tom I feel like the matchup Zone uh has given Clemson problems because again looks like theyre in a man but its almost a Zone with a man principal Florida State have not excuse me Clemson has not been able to kind of penetrate it looking for Clark made the catch then the spin so Corin picked up the foul as Clark went up to grab that alleyoop attempt great recognition by Jay Hunter try to get on the backside of that that zone there four on Corin by the way Clark is up to 10 rebounds in the game Ive been impressed by his game today even though he hasnt scored its just his overall game a planned defense he love his game all around first free throw attempt of the game for Clark 0 for five and field goal attempts into the box score as far as points are concerned for Jack Clark graduate student cheltonham Pennsylvania spent three years in the Lal program last year played 23 games for NC State one of Applause two Watkins drew the attention Miller misses three Hall comes across for the rebound had it poked away warley tried to save it warley was on the sideline so that will be Tiger basketball when we come back every tiger whos played tonight has scored theyve got the lead over Florida state with three game sum presented by Pacific light creating Financial Security for more than 150 years and Florida state has been on a 136 run the last 4 minutes and 51 seconds when we talked about the fact that look early like Clemsons going to run away with it theyve been able to get some stops and youve been able to have some key players step up theyve done a good job of being able to change the momentum back in their favor Tom I say its going to probably come down to the gut Clemsons got to find a way to get back to their offensive Rhythm fantastic atmosphere tonight for ACC basketball inside Little John Watkins is the leading SC Florida state with 18 Miller has 12 Spears Off the Bench with 12 18 for Gerard 15 for Chase Hunter and 12 for RJ Godfrey Off the Bench for the Tigers six made threes for the Tigers four of those from Joe Gerard shck inside of 10 for Hunter looks Gerard to beat the clock tip to warley another good defensive possession by Florida statey drives trying to calculate the angle couldnt do it Corin fighting on the offensive glass against Hall it is a turbulent time in the paint for these players you see cam corn down there not giving up on the play wig got foul for the Tigers coach Hamilton the Florida state Hall of Famer most wins in school history trying to add to that total with pouring at theow Applause line Miller trying to track it down and it might have been Clark stepping on the end line now he gets tangled up with Applause Miller so it looks like as Miller had possession he was out of bounds its a close play on the Baseline Brian you see right there Miller and Clark getting tied up right there maybe the right foot of Miller came down on the line prior to this yeah so its Tiger basketball Florida States done a good job of being able to limit Clemson but they cant capitalize on the other end love to see try to give PJ Hall a touch in the post Tigers will be home against pit on Tuesday as Hall loses Applause hand wat two and A2 minutes to play in regulation Watkins Ang great by great weak side help by Ian on that shot by Applause Watkins eight blocks in the game forson nows the time that youre up by seven a little bit over two minutes you run the clock Jo Js been here before third all time in ACC history in made threes hes trying to drive it this time Applause warley picks up the foul geard did a good job of being able to run a little clock and you saw in the first half putting his head down aboring that contact talked about the fact that this guy that shoots 94 95 from the free throw line fourth on warley making his way to the Florida state bench area so there is a timeout taken by Florida State and Leonard Music Hamilton Florida State four and three on the road in the ACC cross the way for the Tigers we take a look at our player of the game brought to you by Progressive Insurance sa when you bundle Auto home or motorcycle insurance visit progressivecom huge presence from RJ gford we talked about this Clemson bench they a lot of it was his ability come in with his energy Finish Well was strong around the boards and also around the rim 12 points fishing four for five and I really thought that he was the one that set the tone especially in the first half when PJ hall went with those early two fouls and Ian shefflin not being able to get on the board so Godfrey and the Tigers try to win their fourth in a row in the series and seven of the last n against Florida State 22 minutes off the bench for godf the NS have not won here since 2019 when they won 7764 they need a comeback in the final two minutes against Brad brell and the Tigers coach brell all time leader in wins here at Clemson as well looking for win number 260 was the Clemson coach so just the one turnover by the N who trailed by 10 at half time and by as many as 16 in this second half and thats how they were able to get back into the game getting some stops taking care of the basketball and was just until recently you know Clemson was able to find some offense know they had droughts where they werent able to score again not being able to find any rhythm from outside beyond the arson did a good job of being shut down the lane Gerard is four for four from the free throw line make it five for five tomorrow its the season finale of CW womens Hoops as the Cavaliers head the Louisville looking for the upset as they face the powerful Cardinals Virginia number 20 Louisville tomorrow 12 Eastern 900 am Pacific only the C Gerard from the Applause line Gerard with the throws up to 20 points hes also got four made threes e 20o game Gerard in a Clemson uniform Miller driving oh good block by deflected by clar and taken back by the Tigers what look like a easy Blow by by Miller good recovery by an shein thats two Big Blocks that hes come up with in the last couple of plays and nine blocks ties a season high for the Clemson Tigers shot clock to 10 for Hunter he drive it drop it to Hall what a pass and the play was set up by Chase Hunter threw it back over his shoulder gets it over to PJ hall Hall does a good job of being a to finish off hand Spears rattles it home FL a state trying to hang in there as Spears hit that jumper along the Baseline watch this p is pass by Chase hunter gets the ball over to PJ hall and then again feo Spears weve talked about him since hes come in hes been a force to be reckon with Off the Bench for Florida State keeping him in the game he did not play in the win against Boston College on Tuesday 8476 he has showed up tonight for sure had struggled in his last four games only 13 points bran but tonight for Spears 14 points on five of 12 also has a threepointer Tom if Im in the huddle with with Florida State if Im lard at Hamilton youre down by nine points with just a little bit over a minute youre going to extend your coverage try to come up and you realize right now Florida state only has 1 30 second timeout Clemsons got a full and a 30 second extend your defense if you cannot get anything you play the foul game youre sitting there youre trying to say okay you dont want to foul Joe Gerard but we want to try to find a way to get the ball back tigers are of 20 from the line tonight as a team as one of the better free throw shooting teams in the AC yeah but you got to roll the dice you cannot allow them to continue the roll to to run the clock because again youre talking about two possessions youre down by nine Clark running the Baseline and Hall Hunter had it poked away inside Spears gave it up for warley right into PJ Hall 59 seconds on the game clock and it gives Florida State opportunity to get points on the board you get the turnover and you see basically get the ball and then you get the ball over to warley hes able to to absorb that contact and looks like thats four fouls on BJ Hall first free throws tonight for wary got every piece of the rim on that Applause one 7 from the free throw line for the season for warley makes it a seveno game he has six points now with the free throws St with the pressure they prod the turnover time they double right away and Hunter a time out last couple possessions having a little bit of an issue with the Florida state pressure Florida State doing a good job cut this lead down to seven so the Tigers last year 23 11 overall went to the NIT and lost to the first round of Morehead State trying to get into tournament for the first time since 2021 what stands out for me Tom is the net ranking of 25 and the quad one record a four and three you see be a good Alabama team obviously head pit the TCU team early nonconference win and at Carolina was huge for them and the fact that the last five games 4 and one I would say between them and weight four is probably two of the hottest teams in the league the win at North Carol was the highest rank win on the road for the Clemson Tigers since 1976 never TR in the game Brad barell will tell you is that the history of Clemson at U UNC has not always faired well for the Tigers but the last few years definitely have done a lot better at winning on the road and they won in 2020 in overtime in Chapel Hill as well for two alltime wins Gerard has it trying not to foul him warley steps in and fouls Gerard and sends him to the de and heres the thing you guys Clemson basically backpedaling the last thing you want to do is f foul Joe Gerard if anything you double team him Force the ball out of his hands because now hes shown that hes money from behind that free throw line so thats going to be five on wary you mentioned Brian the win against Alabama which at the time was number 23 in the nation they beat Alabama on the road and then December 3rd went and beat pit on the road as well back to back 7970 in their first conference game of the schedule Ive always thought when you look at good teams especially in the ACC you got to have great guard play you check that box with Gerard and Hunter then youve got to have good defense when you look at basically PJ Hall Ian sheflin and then you look at their bench and then with the fact that this is a team that shoots the ball you your defense travels I mean obviously Brad will probably tell you this one of his better teams because you got a solid bench You got bigs and you check all of the boxes they can score as well almost 79 points per game fourth in the ACC and it looks like the rest may be looking at Joe dard never he never got across the half court and Im curious if theyre going to look at this to see if that may have been a potential violation before the foul so the officials are over at the scorers table Bert Smith and Jamal Spearman taking a look at the game clock the shot clock Gerard bringing it up a lot of components here to evaluate and again those Gerard even beat the count prior to the foul well look right before the foul right the foul was not Watkins it was right there warley warley and then Gerard goes to the court so trust me if they overturn this cover your theres going to be a lot of howling in a minute by angry tiger fans this game is far from over sevenpoint game with 486 seconds to go so they are going to allow Gerard to go for go to free throw line but both teams double bonus Two Shots Gerard this is not breaking news he is six of six from the free throw line so you just telling me thats aouch thats pretty much the way things work and you know he comes out well before the game starts and gets up 100 shots and 100 free throws and does all the little things in his fifth year of college basketball well hes had one in the first half that really touched the rim he probably going to be frustr himself although that one barely even touched the net his season high was 26 against Boston College where he made five threepointers now up the 22 points after the theyll come out wigg in and heres the difficult thing for Florida State this is not a great threepoint shooting team youre down nine with 40 seconds left to go you got to be able to score quickly four of 18 on three Spears with a quick two oh nice nice bucket by Primo Spears how big has he been for Leonard Hamilton in this Florida State PCH he has been an impact transfer from Georgetown the junior Primo Spears from Harford Connecticut and so thats the last time out by Florida State one remaining for Clemson updated look at the standings North Carolina with a win today at Virginia first time in 12 years Duke with a loss on the road at Wake Forest P got a win in our first game of CW Courtside Saturday and the two teams at 8 and seven trying to break out of that pack Clon to Florida State but Tom you look at this Log Jam again you see a lot of teams down there with nine wins eight wins seven losses but the thing too is that with this weight for team sitting at 10 and six theres a chance for them to probably lead frog Virginia and then youve got about six teams down there hes got basically four games so its going to come down to the gut of the Season NC has 201 to get back to the NCAA but heres the thing is I thought maybe last weard excuse me had them basically sitting as one of the last F four teams in and then when you look at what theyve been able to do huge win at home against pit and obviously Bea Duke thats huge ex to the ACC tour walk away but heres the thing you never catch the first guy as always the second guy during the the replay if they look at this youre going to basically see the foul and youre going to see PJ Hall watch the foul right here by Watkins he goes for the ball its a foul call watch the little chicken wing byj Applause H its a little frustration there from Watkins right there but hes got to keep his head because youre trying to extend this game the last thing you want again Watch foul PJ Hall gives him a little bit of a chicken wing if youre youre Watkins thats a no no you cannot go ahead and do that trying to maintain his PO and I think he knew exactly what he had done because he tried to grab the shirt of break his fall just a little bit but the damage had already been done at that point and again its unfortunate because these teams have played wow what a battle its been tonight between these two teams and again we knew coming into this game this is a big game for both teams sitting at 8 and seven and so now youve got Watkins being assessed to technical foul so all three officials are at the scores table to figure out this situation Hall certainly did the right thing to his credit to walk away from the area vacate the area he knew that you know once he got pushed and watch right there he hes smiling he basically was smiling and saying hey you know what the damage has been done play on keep your head so thats B Smith going back to the scor T Tommy Morris is making hiss Brian Oliver he will us the on that last sequence Mor is over at the scor T and then over to our broadc position talking with chick withi we retaliation thats are going to canji going to come andif f canel so we heard the explanation Brian did you hear it we heard a lot of it but go ahead get wait for some booze because again basically what it ises you saw the first foul right there so the refs are going to call the chicken wing on PJ theres a double technical foul thats basically going to cancel out foul on Watkins and then the technical on PJ thats going to be his fifth foul resulting in a disqualification Clemson will have the two free throws but the the substitution will shoot the free throws so Hall is discussing it with BT Smith wait for it so Hall will foul out with seven points and two rebounds his teammate certainly picked up the slack in his absence tonight he got in early foul trouble as well I knew it was I told you when the fer came over you say wait for some boo so Wiggins is going to come in it looks like to shoot the free thr got to bring in a substitution for Hall and wi right now has not attempted a free throw again double technical foul Watkins for Florida State hall for Clemson and that brings on PJ Halls fifth foul so Wiggins at the line has a lot of free throws had been 14 of 17 prior to that Miss and and Tom if he misses this this is good as a turnover for Florida State because again you still are down seven with 40 seconds left to go that pops out too and Jackson got it spear trying to run it up for a quick two his pass was intercepted by Clark all long is been Clark thats time and make those big plays Gerard fou in the back court a little chippiness between Clemson and Florida Music State so Watkins just picked up the foul defending Gerard in the back court his third Gerard tonight is eight of eight from the Applause line 94 of the season and that percentage might go up just a little bit after the effort tonight best in the AC at the free throw line Jo Applause Gerard thats 24 points to lead all scorers for Joe Gerard for the Tigers final 2 seconds shot clock is off Jackson for three rattles around shein came down with it and then Watkins bumped sheflin ninth rebound of the game for shefin add one more give him 10 double figure rebounds for the 12th time this season for shefin well and heres the thing if youre Brad Rono you have to win games and this was one of those games that you knew about it was going to be a physical game you knew also the how Florida state was going to come out and what they were going to try to do is you see sheflin Id be able to knock that that one down but Clemson has basically shown up and their bench has been solid for them and the backourt I think Joe Gerard and Chase Hunter came up Applause huge final 10 seconds with Spears on the move shefin has it for another board final seconds ticking away 38 foul committed by the Applause NS fourth on Baba Miller a valiant effort by the noes coming up short on the road and theyll drop to four and four in conference away from Tallahassee CLS will improve 19 and8 overall 9 seven in conference play and four and four at home this year in ACC play this should be their 10th home win led by as many as 16 in the second half Florida State cut it to single digits that is going to do it 74 63 is the final Brad Brown the Tigers and we thank you for watching ACC
