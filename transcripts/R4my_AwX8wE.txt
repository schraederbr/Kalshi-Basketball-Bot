All right Ill tell you what All right here we go Stanford of course wearing the home white Montana State out of the Big Sky Theyre one and two to start their season Lost a tough game Lost at home by two points to Denver on Sunday Stanford winning two home games so far Last game was Montana as we see the starting five for the Cardinal And theres Benny Geler Thats but Benny Geler you know hes you know I like your point about that hes a point guard but he can do that Well he can hit the shot And he just hit the shot that Steph Curry made famous that set shot from inside outside which is increased by his range Great block inside rim protector just what you need And the Montana State starters as Geler Well Benny Gelers up 5 nothing Going to take this thing over is Benny Maybe hes tired of hearing about Aqua Wait how about me Im a senior Yeah And Jed Miller who Matt Loie the coach of the Bobcat says quarterback of the team on the floor Coach of the team Fouryear player from Montana State I love saying that in this era Four years for the same school Yeah Coach on the floor Thats what he called him He said Smart heady knows what hes doing Runs a club Good shooter Going to have to do something here Oh my Nice poke by Aquara Two seconds though at the clock Nice luxury to have your center out on the floor or at least your power forward defending a guard and doing a good job with it Wingspan of Aiden Cam there to guard on this Lets see what the two second play is for Montana State Its going to be a heave Nope Didnt get it off in time Is the ruling That last time Montana State had a really nice possession went to the basket hard as you should but you hate to see kids avoid contact We tried to dunk it and avoid contact Great block but you got to create contact at least get to the line You mentioned earlier today the eyeball test would confirm physical edge to Stanford big time No question I mean lets be honest this is the third Big Sky opponent that Stanford has played and they should have an edge and theyre at home But Stanford just a little steps Well youre in the wrong league Chisum Get up a level and you could take four or five of those Nobody would have questioned it Just ask Giannis Did you see that move Yiannis made I I didnt I didnt even up on travel Its just about a week and a half ago It was only four and a half steps I didnt think it was egregious Create cont Okay See thats what he should have done before I thought he jumped in and created the contact Now at least he gets to the foul line which is what you have to do This is Patrick McMahon on the move Had Roi gone straight up had that arm not been extended He might have gotten away with that because the body contact was minimal All right Patrick McMahon there you see from Palmer Alaska just outside of Anchorage There isnt much outside of Anchorage But a great place though Did you ever play in the shootouts Any of the shootouts up there Yeah we did And we went on a dog dog sled ride as part of the the whole deal It was really fun Lot of dribble See look at Oh look at him What a nice split there Yeah I think for Ibuka to be most effective and what people are really commenting about is off missed shots or turnovers in the open court and how difficult he is to get squared Hes re reasonably big I mean hes not small at 62 but boy is he fast Mad Loi there Its his third year at Montana State First year they won the Big Sky tournament Made their third straight NCAA Young guy that uh Northwest roots although he was at Lehigh for quite a while Played at Lehigh coached at Lehigh for seven years Oh nice job there Christian King He went right into contact Lois done a good job wherever hes been Hes won a division three hes won at division two and now hes won at division one See he just bullied Yep Blocked foul there as Apara used that strength to get inside against number four Kevin Holden on the foul So your natural instinct here boy I dont know what you do defensively I think the only thing he might have tried to do is move his feet to make it a little more square in the chest but theres not much else he could have do done All he could do there is pick yourself up Yeah Well poor is a a man for sure Theres another inside outside Ger with eight to start You got to stay home in the corner defensively The natural tendencies to turn your head Thats the best shot in the game Inside outside in the corner Boy I like that kid Move Yeah thats nice McMahon again Yeah very comfortable Good 67 fiftheyear guy And theres another fifth year guy Rajosi who started as a walkon for Kyle Smith at Washington State He was a walkon And Kyle basically said Look the minutes arent going to be here So he went and got a degree at a great D3 school Yes Claremont Blood one of the best that small group of schools in that area Cameman gives it off Geler stay hot Benny Nope Yep there it is Yep All right cheering Little heat check right there Ted Yes it was You knew that was coming didnt you Yeah sure Why not travel Yep Stanfords got a very solid play up top in handling on ball screens Theyre going to try to force him to the side of the floor and show run him off the top He tried to come back and just didnt have the handle Kyle Smith alongside Jim Shaw there That veteran coach that came from Washington State Head coach is funny Look at him over there Just cant believe that they could turn the ball over What are we doing A para tried to whip it in there but Miller intercepts for Montana State Chris Hodgees is trying to set a high screen Christian King wants Rahosi Boy nice job Held that pivot foot Nice little inside touch Thats a tough shot that midrange And you know people dont shoot midrange anymore They dont like the two Everybody wants the three Got a mismatch sizewise there Quick pass up and thats the man that were asking Matt Logan today Who do you thinks your best shooter from the three And he thought Holden But look at him just barge Just barge Just uses his strength to split that That at the very least should have been contact Nice play by the big fella right here early on Montana State back in Maples Pavilion Such a familiar place Nothing much has changed from when Mike Montgomery was winning games here making Stanford number one in the country And if we had a time tunnel right now Benny Geler would have been a point guard for you Oh no Bennys great I mean he you know the thing is hes really a good shooter and he always has been and theyre getting inside outside looks which allows him to step in and as I said thats what Steph Curry has made a living in that step in its not a jump shot its a set shot which gives you more range and hes very good at it but from Montana States perspective they have got to get the ball squared and not let Stanford create opportunities off penetration so far has wanted to take it right at him and theyve got to get him in foul trouble make him pay for that penetration chism okara Its interesting how weve uh started the game talking all about Ibuko Aorei and havent since and now hes out after the first time out Jeremy Dent Smith is in for Stanford So was Ryan Agarwal Nice inside outside look there Thats and a knockdown three by Darien Brown or Dave excuse me Brown whos averaging 15 off the bench 16 See let go take it Every time hes trying to create opportunity for a guy that size Deep shot for Dent Push in the back Edgarwall who missed the last game was sick Has been sick This is his first actual playing time for quite some time So hes allowed to be a little rusty And they got Aggerwall there on the little back push Den Smith the transfer from Cal State Dom to Mingus Hills Who would have thought player of the year in that conference and yeah even here weve got Montana State Weve got guys that have transferred up number zero Davian Browns one of those guys Ni Nia and then Biola in LA Yeah For four plus years and now getting one year in the Big Sky But hes you know hes got some years under his belt and the baskets still 10 feet 10 feet high Nice take Yep And the weak side rebound is there for Cammon Oh little shuffle there on the attempt to back his way in I mean first blush it almost looks a little bit like Stanfords impatient thinking they can score fast And Montana States hanging in there I mean theyre good position Theyre tr theyre tough Theyre physical Doing a nice job Sure Stanford would like to get out of the break a little bit Yeah You know Big Sky basketball out here in this part of the world We know you know well good level basketball good level of coaching Yeah Traveling Kyle Smith today was really high on Matt Loie Knows known him quite a while through the Matts coaching time mostly in the Northwest Lois been good wherever hes been Hes won wherever hes been I think hes patient with the kids Of course theyve got kids that stick around These kids are veterans Theyre not young all freshman type which youre seeing a lot of programs have Hes trying to barge the smaller players just like you knew that Oh nice block Weak side help right there Good anticipation Waka Embach from Gambia To the weak side and he comes catches that thing Transfer from Florida State So you know hes played against some good big guys in that league right Oh Cory is back in the game for Stanford Oh nice inbounds and it ends up being the flush for Braosi Very good inbounds and you know that Montana State went over to that and shoot around Oh how about that Three shot by Embach D Smith back for Stanford Yeah deep shot Long rebounds usually results in a run out They didnt get it there Heres where you got a issue here Trying to contain with the big See he just cant Hes not quick enough All that switching up top Jaden step ended up on a Cory Yeah transfer from Colorado State Nice inbounds right there Good patience just waited for him to set the screen and then come back caused by the emphasis on trying to keep Okorei contained and the big man just rolled back up top and heres a three from Scratia and a slap there and a foul will be called on step of Montana State you know I think that coach Loi will live with that because they doubled on the on ball screen on Okorei and were willing to leave the big open and of course he missed it They wont miss all that those shots was Dent actually No different play See theres that high ball screen again Wow And he splits it again No problem Yeah you cannot if youre going to double you absolutely cannot let him split you Youve got to get together and force him to the outside Heady heady play by the guard right there Jed Miller launching and the long rebound is going to be saved in front of the Stanford bench Two saves Yeah New shot clock goes to 20 cheering Mbatch hit Miller They had two back doors there Miller was the second one Yeah going to back cut Second player was going to come for a dribble handoff and he just went back door Very nice play Very well conceived and read Cameron Grant in the game for Stanford along with Scr No And long rebound Loose ball to Montana State So first eight minutes and change is like Mike said the Bobcats hanging right with Stanford despite the Geler Yeah Rip to start the game Not intimidated at all Step inside and ducked under but Grant rebounds Nice move No lift Couldnt get above anybody to get it to the basket How about that Lefthanded Very very explosive first step Thats what everybody is talking about That first step quickness at point of attack to the basket and of course the ability to finish both hands with all the way with the left there That was something Nice reversal there Inside was Jeremiah Davis Okari pushing it Agarwal on the lane is fouled and hell be at the break when we come back So a little flash here of the excellence of freshman Cory Left hand off the glass Count it game of the season for Stanford up five on Montana State In recent history Montana State has been real good This is the series history And what is stunning to me and many others probably who know you say the same thing First meeting in 50 years How did you miss scheduling this Oh come on now laughter You I was here You didnt miss much We only played Duke and North Carolina laughter Uh I tell you Big Sky basketball is good basketball I you know I was in that league for 13 years and it is good basketball And it you know I just came back from a football game at Montana and it is really good football as well Wait a minute Mike was just inducted into the Montana Hall of Fame this past weekend Agarwal at the line Congratulations It Its basically a Hall of Fame of week for Mike right now Hall of Fame every week Settle down I mean they look around for people Im the only old guy left that How many tables How many tables did you buy laughter All my old coaches were there Larry Rotoyak Bla It was really special Bob Neil came back It was really fun Good friend of ours Wayne Tinkle at Oregon State His wife Lisa was there Her team was honored Yeah She was there to protect Wayne cuz I like Montana States toughness though Not intimidated against an AC school ACC school on the road Looks like theyve settled down a little bit defensively Screen now trying to stop Stepps drive Got to shoot it and its blocked inside on a baseline out of bounds to Stanford Rajosi finally was the man that blocked that scoop attempt Stanford did a great job of closing out to the threepoint shot and forcing Montana State to drive And hes driving into traffic where theres no place to go Again you got to create contact get to the foul line You cant try to avoid contact That defensive possession is whats gotten people uh been impressed by what Kyle Smith has done in a year plus here You know Kyles an excellent coach Theres no question about that He knows how to win Nice open left hand No just rolled off and Miller runs it down for Montana State Nice defense right there move his feet get his chest in front Good hard drive by McMahon Stanford trying to push with Geler back in the game Grants open Maybe thats why Yep Adrenaline I think Stanfords doing a good job now physically on defense being a little more physical in proper position and Montana States having a hard time getting a clean look Turn is shot by Embach Cleared by screened up for Stanford This is what people want to see right here in the ball Look at another lefthanded drive See hes just so quick getting Its deceptive Its smooth You dont see that but he gets by people and he gets inside and hes big enough to create contact Hard to get him squared Hes going to be a factor He just get by the big guy and then he just jumps right in So heres what Kyle Smith said but may lead in to your point about Brevin Knight and the comparisons earlier Kyle said its what Eric Revano was here with you Brevin Knight played whatever team Brevin Knight played on in practice one Kyle said anytime you put a Cory on the floor in fall work his team won So yeah and that he said that and thats a very valid point because thats exactly what Brevin did And we had brought in a junior college allAmerican guard that year and he came in and said Coach I got to start And I said Frank every team I put Brevin on they win Hes starting And its what Kyle said today The same thing happened You know youre not sure about Okorei coming in as a freshman Is he going to start right away And the answers become yes Yes for that reason And theres a little floater inside by Holden And by the way for those of you listening who know Stanford Mike didnt misspeak that was actually true A junior college guard Yes Might be the only one ever Two Kenny Ammon was a junior college Oh okay Good call Oh I forgot about he uh he was a guard We won the NIT John Patrick and Kenny Ammon Pivoting spinning inside is Hodgeges Chris Hodes Muscle move Came from Wisconsin to play at Montana State this year Took away the defensive pressure by jumping in defensively Okor is very aggressive trying to get to the basket and Okores that drive off the side Miller back No edge Oo in and out Yep Kings three shot Good rotation Its interesting to see when Ger and Okore are on the floor together how often each one brings the ball up Oh he traveled That should have been a charge Whoa Lets see which way it goes here Although Im not sure that he didnt use good judgment there by not stepping in front of the big fella That could have been that could have been a death sentence All right defensive foul put up pair at the line when we come back A capsule look at some Stanford first half defense Defense being played by both groups Back door cut Oh the big fella just comes over and knocks it out of there That was created more at bad offense but Stanford very well schooled defensively Good rebound right there I talked to Travis Te from Montana who played them the other day and he said Stanford really defended them and that was quite a compliment Yeah Aiden Cammon there AJ Roi But I Ill say one note now thats interesting in this game Stanford leads by five with Octra at the line but Montana State 17 points 12 of them in the paint against Stanford Yeah Interesting Well I I think Stanford defends the three I think anymore if youre going to play in college basketball and be effective defensively You have to defend the threepoint line because everybodys looking to do that You know analytics says you got to chef threes because shoot 33 you get 50 You know you get two point you get two points Its Its the way everybodys going Nice DHO right there Some good defense and miss Good look there for Holden Missed the three Poor thy way Get out of the key There you go Translate dribble handoff right Yep Dent Smith dribble handoff Good poke Jeremy Dent Smith poked it Now theyre going to reach in Lets see Is it tied up Yes And Arrow will go to Montana State I think Dent Smiths reputation come out of Dominguez Hills is as a shooter a scorer This obviously a different level maybe a little quicker player youre playing against Bigger Hes got a hydrant build to him though doesnt he Yeah You get that square look to him He was player of the year in that league which is a good basketball league What leagues like that dont get are typically as real good big guys A twotime allAmerican in division two playing at Dominguez Hills Kick clock to 20 Jim Shaw assistant coach is sort of the architect of the defense Ive watched them practice two or three times Does a really good job Gets after him Very sound in his teaching All right McMahon with the ball now for Montana State Entered to Hajes Backing Aara in Hes got a move there Nope Nope Nope Hodgees had to shoot it Yeah big fell He Hes got to Hes got to take it and come back the other way and get maybe probably a jump hook or something right there Those two big guys going after each other I think Hodgees probably used to having a size advantage weightwise strengthwise Didnt have one there No Although hes at Wisconsin hes playing with some big boys Yeah no question But hes not there so theres probably a reason Lot of DHOs a lot of people dribble handoffs up front top trying to create mismatches or the open look that Rahosi had Instead he takes it in That was good defense right there Note that his arms were straight up not creating a foul situation Thats just a kid thats been well coached Here we go again The two big guys Ah this time good play There you go Thats we go Go right in the back Maybe he likes left shoulder Maybe he wasnt comfortable going the other way Wants to get over left shoulder He did there Montana States hanging in there Charge Nope Misfire by Oy Yeah So Stford has not been able to extend the lead at all King right now Three has not been Montana States friend in this first half Theres something very subtle that happened Well probably not see it but uh see what we have coming up here Number seven See now he faces up and he comes in and he likes the left shoulder jump hook Thats a really good play What you want to do is take that left shoulder away and make him drop step If he can do that then you got a real good inside player What I started to say Ted was Rajosi got away with a little push to clear some space to get the ball over the top Subtle very small Official not generally going to call that but it did create enough space for him to get fouled Yeah Well thats smart play though not let him get the automatic shot the dunk make him go to the line even and and he gets gets rewarded Montana States hanging in there Stanfords working hard Maybe didnt expect this Nice defense right there Looking to move his feet laterally Hodgees up top Good look Oh and thought maybe Aquaria got a piece of that Thought so Maybe not Here comes Stanford back Fontana States only made one three in this first Well I think that Stanfords got them sped up a little bit Ted and so theyre not getting the shots they want Oh thats double dribble Yeah I thought so too Ah that split didnt work for OCore And then he comes back from behind to exchange turnovers and then a shuffle Dent Smith trying to avoid Jed Miller So a flurry of turnovers Ball back to Montana State Little bit of contact both ways that time but you dont mind that as long as its consistent Let kids play and they get to understand whats going to be allowed Our officials Tommy Morrisy Trey Styrons Michael Kits all ACC officials came out east but they got a double out of this They were at Cal Monday night game here tonight Oh nice up and under right there Was that a Claremont Mud special Well he tried to avoid contact Might have been able to get the threepoint play Thats what Kyle Smith asking his assistants where whered that come from Nice floater back Yeah By Davian Brown Its a sixpoint game Ted You know Montana States done a nice job of hanging in there Not intimidated at all in Stanford Theres nice take right there by Dent And to your point about the threepoint shot its importance today were weve only had three made in the entire half Geler made two early for Stanford Montana States made one Thats it Both teams doing a really good job at defending the threepoint line which is forcing people to get go to the basket Go There it is Cam the big man getting out on McMahon but Hodgees holds his ground and scores Very patient Lift lift get the other players off their feet and go up and score it Nice job So its not threepointers its points in paint that were getting both ways Yes sir Cameron screens Geler gives it back Chance to cut it to three if they can make another three here I just getting a nice run here McMahon See if he gets over that left shoulder again Thats where hes going Oh he had his jersey Yes he did Blocked Held ball This one goes to Stanford As we get under three minutes to go in the half well have a timeout Thats been the Look at that move Nice up and under music right there I think I would prefer to force contact Good patience right there Good patience Get it off the glass State hoping to do something theyve never done before While Stanford hopes to keep a really nice streak alive They play a lot of nonconference games against Big Sky teams Yeah And theyre theyre guaranteed and theyre all at home and you you got to win those Thats thats just what you have to do Uh Montana States been what how many years did we determine 50 years since they played 1975 M Mike Mike Bratz I think they showed was on that 75 team final two and a half more or less here See who gets the better of things near the end of the half Thats going to be a bad screen there on Cam of Stanford We still have the points of the paint are dominant right now 34 of the 52 points so far have been scored in the paint Opora Oporas limping out there There Hurt his leg a little bit See what if he gets him out or not Kyles looking Oh thats charge Yeah Davian Brown lowered that shoulder Yeah Off arm Yep Lead shoulder Lowered it If you keep your hands off natural tendencies to reach out and see right there He doesnt he just plays with his body and he he gets pushed off Keep an eye on Apora see if he continues to live out there Standing in the corner Den Smith driving it No And off the battle came applause alive by Chris One point shy of the largest lead in the half Stanford briefly nine up Step threw it right to Dent Smith cheering A power catch and fouled Steppp is bound and determined from Montana State to get to the basket but he gets in there and he really doesnt have anything to do and its caused them some problems all night long inside Got to go straight up and not create contact Make him shoot in traffic Chzok par from Brooksville New York Thats up in Westchester County north to the city One of two players that were Harvard either Harvard established or Harvard bound He was at Harvard Okara and Mubuko Cororey had committed to Harvard Thatd be two pretty good players for Harvard in the IB wouldnt it Man Tommy is not fooling around there No he isnt Hes always been very good Stanford well schooled defensively taking away the percentage things forcing Montana State to really have to work to get a good shot Whoa Wow How about that Came just barely missed getting a piece of that but Christian King swished it Just the second made three for Montana State He just stepped back Transfer from University of Washington Whoa And how about Dealers third He says Dont forget about me Yep 10point lead now All of a sudden its danger time for Montana State Theyve played so well But theres the answer Yeah absolutely All right Points in the paint for most of the half And now we trade threes here down the stretch Yeah You stay close play tough all half and then you let them sneak away at the end Thats not what you want And screen does miss All right Montana State If they push quickly theyll get a two for one Saved in Stanford with it Kyle Smith I think wants it slowed Although there is a 4second clock difference If they can get a basket here go up 10 And thatd be the biggest lead theyve had See when theyll go see what they do I almost guarantee its going to be an onball screen Geler sets it You see the shot clock Oh thats tip that one off Geler Yes Seven seconds Deflected first by Jeremiah Davis And then it just touched Gelers hand on the way So heres your loser to use it timeout and Montana State will set something up see if they can get something And lo and behold they could go down four with a threepoint shot Something turnovers even Ted nine to nine We were talking to you know you had a lot of connections with Matt Loi today saying you know he was one of the guys when Kyle Smith left for Stanford Matt Loi was one of the guys a natural guy that Washington State would look at Yeah As a potential head coach To his credit to the schools credit you see the basics of Montana State Boseman Matt Loi very comfortable there Feels like hes been well taken care of The two Montana schools are really good institutions very well uh supported athletically very successful Footballs are both very good So it is a comfortable place to be Did you recruit Craig Kilborn No How about that Well thats another sign of a coach right How about that play Yeah that was very well drawn up coming out of a timeout Really impressive for 20 points in the paint for Montana State in the first half 18 for Stanford No you would have thought Stanford sizewise just physically would have had a big advantage But you know everybodys been trained to take away the threepoint line and not give people that percentage outside threepoint look And Montana State and Stanford have taken advantage of that All right Bobcats scored the last five points of the first half Hodes felt the double gets it out to Christian King One thing Stanford did very well secured the defensive board Only one offensive rebound for Montana State A power back in Hes just so big He gets ahead of Steve and hes pretty much bound and determined to get in the paint and hes gotten there whenever hes wanted to travel there Oara strength highlight the one stat that is available now that I really enjoy Oara drew four fouls in the first half Well he I mean he just lowers your shoulder and goes and if youre not square now theres a nice screen but they should have doubled that right away and maybe they would have got Stanford in some problems Thats where hes good He can get to the basket Good body control in the paint I think were going to see him be a little more dominant in the second half Unless Im missing my guess foul there Yep Power got caught Thatll be his first Generally when youre closing on the sideline I would think you would want to direct him to the sideline play on his right hand and youre helping the corner Stanford only committed three fouls in the first half Yeah And theyre physical so thats uh its well taught on defense to be in the right position Nice switch right there McMahon puts it down drives it scores it and one Created contact and stayed off balance Good strong legs to be able to score the ball off the bump right there Left hand dribble Yep Absolutely A foul And I love being able to say and one Yeah And its you know thats the new one Great rule changes Yeah Thats the gather where he was in his shooting motion and and giving credit for the play Yeah Folks around the country probably dont know but about a decade ago the Pack 12 Yes The Pack 12 hired Ed Rush whos a longtime NBA rep Ed Rush came in as the director of officiating for basketball and he put the continuation in The Pack 12 used it for a couple years but I guess the coaches didnt like it too much so they phased it back out Ed Rush tried a lot of different stuff that the coaches didnt like laughter We were doing just fine I know how to pick the scabs We were doing just fine Thank you very much But they did But he did bring the continuation in And its just I never understood why you reward defense Like the guy beats you with a move Yeah You foul him Dont penalize the guy that beat you Well the gather Theyre trying to get consistency for sure Thats nice right there H I I Thats all right Thats all right Miler You did the only thing you could You cut tried to get a block off Otherwise you were going to get dunked on So thats a heady play But thats the shot If Okorei can make that watch out because he is so quick Everybodys going to play him for the drive try to keep him out of the paint Oh power ducks in and scores it Boy theres two big guys getting after it inside there isnt it Its fun to watch Gets back quickly to cut off McMahon 10 points now for Chismok Power A just gets in on Cam and hell get back to the line So Stanford didnt foul very much in the first half They fouled three already now in the first two minutes of the second But again the ball going in for Montana State Yeah thats I mean he probably could have got a better shot than that It was almost like he was trying to create the foul rather than make the shot Just a little right hand jump hook which he made earlier would have been the play You know once a big guy takes it a direction and you take it away you cannot let him step back through You have to keep him in the direction that hes going Easier said than done but thats what good post defense is Nice set up Well done by Cory to set it up for Aiden C Well its nice to see We Were thinking okay hes averaging 27 Were expecting this but what hes doing is just playing good basketball and thats what youre looking for Oh nicely done there Boy Montana State and they have run some real nice plays Christian King with the and one block on Okorei See I think they h I think thats would be the way they would call that They I dont know if he was in the box or not but see right there he sees the open play right there Just the role Yeah hes in Well hes in restricted area we thats the the one thing if you remember way back when North Carolina used to run from the exit to get and take a charge from the weak side and it was ridiculous and that was just a continuation of trying to prevent that from happening putting the restricted area in Yeah Oh okay I didnt know that We blame the heels on that Cameman offensive board Nope Lost to Jed Miller Look at that Jed Miller comes out with it Hes tough That nice seal right there gets all the way Yep Good sealers inside there He just screened him off and let him screen the defender off right Yeah Fivepoint game Montana State hanging Oh no And then Geler stumbles So here point out the seal Well you can see right here Good steel bite there Right there Now watch what the big guy does inside He gets him on his back sees him coming He just seals him right there So he keeps power from defending Absolutely Dont let him come over and get in position to to make a defensive play So Stanford has had this where theyve had you multiple eight nine point leads Theyve never been able to extend it 10 points briefly I like that no call right there Thats coming back to Montana State There was contact but I thought the defender was straight up And I I think you have to reward good defense Oh changing They change it Kyle Smith was I think going to challenge that Did come off motioning for the challenge but doesnt need to Thats good defense As long as OPAR is straight up which I think yeah its off 21 No question By the way official Michael Kits was right in there on the call on the baseline his dad We found it official Mike Montgomery praised He coached your Rhode Island one win the great final four Same play again Penetration and then the lob And thats very unselfish Thats going to earn him a lot of kudos with his teammates cuz he could have taken that himself Step back by Holden Whoa Theres Well thats why Matt Loi told us probably his best shooter Yeah Holden Anyway Mike Kits was an official in Mikes regional final win the Rhode Island win that got you to the final four Yes Where we had to foul late to get a chance And uh Michael Kits I remember him I actually do remember him And now we got his son doing games Thats thats fun Lift Boy Yep A just working on Rahosi down there He is Hes using his strength Got the baseline spin OB Im sorry Ted Obviously Stanfords been trained to stay at home to not give up threepoint shot let him dribble down inside letting him defend by himself and hes taking music advantage All right Montana State has a chance here Mike They got a chance to get within two Cut it to two Yeah theyre doing a nice job Stanford frankly look at this This is really a good hustle play You can see why coach Loi likes Miller so much Hes just the glue Hes a tough kid that does a little bit of everything And Montana State executing right now Stanford in a little bit of a dead zone And so this will be Chris Hodes from Shamberg Illinois Its a Chicago suburb about near OHare And guessing the first transfer from Wisconsin so he probably wasnt the biggest and strongest player on that court Ted Just a guess They really I saw the Wisconsin play a game last year at uh Paulie Pavilion actually and man they theyre physical They were physical and that Greg Guards a good coach Yeah Yeah All right So Montana State not able to cut it from four Cameron Grant in and onehanded there C tried to keep the rebound alive for Stanford but Jed Miller back again Comes up with a lot of loose balls Kind of floated a pass in there You dont want to float that thing Get it to him Montana State doing a nice job of keeping Stanford in front of them Making them shoot shots they dont want to shoot Speed them up a little bit Deep three there Long rebound Cameman will save Whoops That ones Ander went the leap And Gayard put it down when theyre stopping him from shooting a three So he put it down and draws a foul Well its just natural tendencies to try to just reach out and grab the ball Play position defense right there He didnt have to do that He had help but gives Stanford 20 more seconds on the clock Nobodys in any foul trouble right now except Rahosi Rahosi of Stanford has three sitting with that back tap and its King Boy Stanford again in that little bit of a score drought Yeah theyre having a hard time getting a good shot Frankly Montana State switching everything And what a difference from the first half where again Montana State Stanford committed only three fouls Stanford has now committed six already in the second and its mostly driving Yeah it is Theyre getting in and Stanfords get I think theyre getting a little bit impatient Their offensive stagnant Yes And so theyre starting to reach and grab and want to get out and and get this thing under control and thats playing right into Montana States hands Were talking just during the timeout You look at Kyle Smith and this is something with the uh move to the ACC for Stanford most of their nonconference at home See the move there by King theyll play one true nonconference road game at San Jose State which is what about 15 miles from here Yeah not really And then you look at Montana State which barely plays any home games in the league Its what you have to do Theyve got five guaranteed games Theyve got to go make money Thats whats happening as you move down the food chain Everybody needs money and they have to play guaranteed games Oh Cory Scoops going to go and one That first step quickness I think thats what everybody has been so impressed with You know he just needs a crack and boom hes gone First step quickness Just a little seam and hes right through it Just like that Youve got to close that boy You got to close that gap You know Mike you were here for long enough you know and Okoris as well as Chisok Power part I was talking to Kyle Smith about this today Stanford has long had a reputation of being an excellent school for Nigerian students from Nigerian families Nigeria is a country of excellent education The families value education and Stanford it started with football and its bled into basketball Chennai of course the womens side a perfect example uh long been regarded as a really good place for Nigerian student athletes Yes its one of the African countries that emphasizes education and generally when you go to Nigeria you can find a kid thats got a pretty good Hey dont look now Ted but we got a one I know After Millers three Oki tried to answer no And how about this Montana State could take its first lead of the game Theres a mismatch right there Oh my McMahon backed his way in but then turns it and he knows he made a drew three people and hes all he needed to do is take his time and kick it straight out because the inside outside pass to a threepoint shooter is the best pass in the game Scrinda in the game with the screen Grant the shot Scrinda the rebound Nice And man lid lid on Stanford feels like its that stretch where the lids on the hoop See I might have been off the Montana State knee but I think maybe rather than call the foul on the reach I think they just did this prudent thing You know what you call thats called good officiating Yes it is You see nobody complaining about that And there is the first Montana State lead Takes the lead Ted Unbelievable Seven minutes and change into the second half And Stanford turns it Stanford getting sped up a little bit now Not getting shots necessarily they want Theyre trying to overpower Montana State physically and theyve just not been able to do that I mean Grants come in and taken several shots from the perimeter as if thats a shot hes supposed to take and make but hes not gotten much done Walk Embatch is in the game for Montana State I think thats the only sub that Matt Loi has made so far in the second half This units playing well King space nicely Oops See what happens here Watch on what they get Theyll get help every chance they can Oh Cory got picked Christian King took it and Christian King has the ball dance out McMahon muscles in Wow And one And Montana State is here Game on I hate to say this Ted but Montana State is out playing Stanford right now Theyre playing smarter Theyre playing every bit as hard And you got some guys stepping up making some plays This really is a surprise but not the way theyre playing music even which if youre Montana State side Im not sure you could have expected that music Mike And then the turnover story is interesting Turnovers right now are squared Not a lot of points off the turnovers No I mean it has been a fairly clean game Neither team shooting the ball very well but uh Montana States doing a really good job of getting the shots they want and and not being backed off by Stanfords physical play which surprises me a little bit This is where I think you got to see Okore and Geler come alive in terms of your guard play and get better shots Boy good play inside but Okara harassed just enough and the shot was off Stanford will keep it with 20 He wasnt on balance Shes got to take his time and lift Get himself on balance and go up strong Nice double Oh and he let him through How about that Oara got through the double Cant let him split the double They did exactly what they wanted to do on the dribble Very well coached but they let him through the gap I dont know if Ive ever seen that Post gets double The balls got to come out right Yeah Wow theres Miller with an answer I I really like that Good I mean Im telling you he said hes like a coach on the floor but hes a tough sucker Benny Geler Theyre getting to Ger You see Geler wants to pull and Oar gets in and he is fouled This would be the other value Its the sixth foul that Okore has drawn in the game See dont close the door Close the door on the double Dont let him through Good job Hes such a big strong kid and hes very determined to score the ball I think for Stanford the way things have gone thus far were going to see a little bit about from this freshman to see whether you know how much hes ready for prime time Hes going to have to start making some plays Yeah Is that what you were talking about early tonight The leadership Yes And its just third third game Real game Yeah and and and hes now going to have to say Okay wait a minute We I I need to help my teammates be better but I also got to make myself impossible to guard and create opportunities Yeah Get to the basket get to the foul line Meanwhile you know who the leading rebounder in this game is The guy with the ball Well thats why Miller he is a tough eight rebound Hes tough man He is a tough sucker And hes from Agori Hills which is right next to where I live And on Q There you go Ted I mean would you imagine that wed be saying Jed Millers a shot at a double double tonight I know Rebounds 10 points now Good double right there Now dont let him through He got through there but no Was hoping for a whistle Didnt get it No Going to have to earn it I think Fells doing a good job I think Miller I think excuse me I think Miller started as a walkon jet I think hes earned all this over the period of time Well reach in there Clock shot clock running low Davian Brown is in the game Get up underneath Create contact Let him go a little bit Officials letting them play Thats good Both teams are comfortable with that And the reachound slap out of bounds by Miller So heres the other thing I dont know Is there an analyst jinx because you ran this big package on Stanford defense earlier Montana State has scored 26 points in the first 10 minutes of this half 26 points They are not intimidated thats for sure which you might expect a Big Sky team to be You know though Curry is going to try to step through and get to the Montana States probably should know by now that Par is going to try to shoot the ball and hes going to try to step through and create contact Theyve got to do a better job of staying square right here Dont let him come back See dont let him step through Ah thats a little uh a little based on whats been called I think that they could have passed on that Well right now the game is being played so much in the paint its going against the grain of what weve talked about college ball being youre not seeing guys kicking the ball out from the block to set up threes covers three of 16 from the arc tonight Yeah theyre covering the kick out very well And notice that the shots Geler got early has not gotten that same look since So thats good coaching Thats just adjusting cheering Miller passing it across the timeline Good crossover there by Christian King Now take it What do you have A base Boy he likes left shoulder Pretty good right now Your scouting report was right on That is all left shoulder for you If he can get left shoulder hes pretty good Sixpoint Bobcat lead Musling in Oara You know the thing that I and I dont know I havent watched Stanford enough to know but its sort of broken down to a oneonone point of attack Theres not much being run in terms of offense or execution of anything Its pretty much getting the ball and timeout Yeah Miller got caught in the bad spot there and he and uh coach Loi having exchanging views on that timeout Montana State which you can coach a guy like that hard You can coach your a player thats that tough and smart hard All right so were going to take a break Just under nine to play Everything you would have wanted in this nonconference game tonight Its a good one music in the second half game at Montana State but only the fourth he started This is the music first time it is a senior that hes ever started This is what college basketball is all about I mean this kids a tough kid Four Hills California right by me but he went to Southern California Academy but hes hes shooting the ball from the outside Hes tough Hes rebounding the ball Hes creating for his teammates Hes doing a little bit of everything And uh Stanford hasnt had an answer May it may end up in the double double and right now getting Millers getting a breather Late clock Christian Kings muscled And look at Wow Hodgees took that rebound away And now back comes Dent Smith with it Jeremy Dent Smith Good defense right there Straight up Thats good Thats well coached And Kyle Smith for the first time going to a different big man Oscar Heel Tes in for the first time as the score comes from Jeremiah Davis And Montana State sixpoint lead Yeah hes a JC transfer A lot of new kids on this roster Montana State switching a lot of screens but not getting in trouble as a result Now right here hes going to get to the basket without a question Oh little strong off the glass on a Cororey but theres Heilte running it down That was a bad switch by Montana State You knew that he was going to get beat and get to the basket And again hanging in the air and drawing the foul Cory thats will be the seventh foul that he has drawn And hell be at the line again as were music just under eight to play Bobcats matching their biggest lead at six defense What do you take away from those low assist totals Most of the baskets have come off individual effort dribble dribble plays and not a lot off draw kick dish that type of thing Usually the ball has been dribbled inside or off the drive and snorts thats what youre seeing right now Its partially because the defense is not allowing Theyre forcing people to beat them at point of attack and Montana State thus far has done the best job of doing that And right now Stanford in a spot where they dont want to leave points at the foul line Well Corys missed a couple now as has Alara in the second half Fivepoint Montana State lead So Miller out of the game right now Well lets see how long he keeps it that way cuz hes been a lead real leader on the floor for them And theres a nice play The freshman from Belgium Hilte with the block Yep The the length See all the way to the basket There he goes And Cororey thats another lefthanded drive and finish cheering Very good with his left hand And I think in some ways I think he he prefers a left hand as far as finishing and a turnover there harassing Cory just bothered Dave Brown enough Yeah See here here comes Miller Its Miller time back in the game Thank god I think youre going to see more now of Okori just getting to the basket Oh good Andre and Camman get Stanford back within one One thing I think Mike Matt we mentioned Matt Loi has not subbed very much in the second half I think he may be trying to make sure his guys have juice here stretch Yeah But at the same time oh my Stanford ratcheting it up a little bit feeling the danger here cheering That was a hammer pass from one of your guys named thats going to be out of bounds off See all of a sudden Stanfords got Mont excuse me Stanfords got Montana State sped up a little bit Now the shots are a little bit rushed Same things not happening Was talking to Wayne Tinkle about this the other night in Corvalis as we see again what Montana States trying to achieve And Stanford has this great noncon winning streak against Big Sky teams Your guy Larry Kristovak nicknamed that baseline pass the hammer pass after Darvet Ham when whom he played within the that is a Greg Papovic original The H Is that right Oh absolutely Well maybe the P he nicknamed it the hammer pass isnt it Yeah No its Yeah its called the hammer Thats the play right And there he comes Just the fourth made three tonight for Stanford And the run here by the Cardinal Eight straight points Montana State needs a play The big guys come in and caused some problems here a little bit We get a chance Ill tell you a story about the hammer because working with Papovic with the world championship team we ran that It was his play called Ham named after Darvin Ham Okay And that baseline drive So I didnt know the Papovic Larry didnt tell me that Oh yeah No its Papovic is for sure And uh go back in see if the big fella can get another block Oo nice play Nice spin man You know which way Hodes is going Yes sir First time we play San Antonio Spurs Papovic comes in First play of the game Im new with the Warriors Whats he run Hammer And they run hammer He looks down and smiles at me laughter Jed Miller went down there with no call A par didnt finish Back comes McMahon on the run as we move toward five minutes and a tie game See if Montana State gets conservative Pass it out of there Oh nice Oh Cory saw that coming CAN HE FINISH IT YES he does And one cheering Used the basket perfectly applause Boy that is the worst when you turn it over for a run out That is the worst Very difficult to get this kid squared He is very good going both ways finishes very well You can see hes going to end up with numbers even though hes not had the type of game people are kind of used to I mean hes got 20 Would you say for a kid playing third game Yeah absolutely And and under some pressure I mean theyre threatened Yeah Well you you know Mike you have to say with all the conversation early on about this young man this is a measure isnt it kind of game the first tight one hes played in Its a game probably if youre Mont if youre if youre Stanford you got to have Its a game you got to have And so you youre going to rely on somebody Maybe everybodys not having a real good individual performance And heres your freshman cheering who reaching in the paint The Stanford foul on Okorei That will be his f or second rather see if Montana State gets stagnant Theyre on the road against a ACC team and the pressure is getting ratcheted up a little bit Its getting a little bit more difficult now Lets see Can Montana State keep its poise Thats going to be the key for them Oh cheering Hajes missing his front end And a chance for Stamford to keep this run going Right now its an 112 run Okara all by himself Sent away by Hajes You can see Okorei trying to penetrate trying to probe Theyve just got to double him and get the ball out of his hands Make somebody else beat it from outside because Stanford has not shot the ball extremely well No Offensive foul Yep Bad screen there Setting up the Miller shot I dont really even think he was trying to screen T I think he was just trying to get out of the way and cleared some space So Hodgees Oh well thats his fourth foul So hes the first I believe that was on Hodgees right Thats the first player in the game to pick up four Yeah And they need him in the game Hes been a factor inside His ability to get over left shoulder and score the ball Well if you Montana State you have nothing to save him for 414 to play Yeah with four minutes I think you got to ride it You might try to buy yourself a minute and let him play the last three but thats about as far as youre going to go Anyway therell be another another timeout will be coming shortly Well step away here Maples just over four to play with Stanford up three A tight 414 just his third game already Ibuka Aorei being asked to as Mike you said so well be exert leadership Deceptively quick and yet not small at 62 185 but music he explodes to the basket Very difficult to get him squared Prep school player at age 14 So hes kind of always played a little bit ahead of his age Each team two timeouts remaining Montana State Oh thats an illegal Ger Geler His fourth made three Clutch Clutch made three right there Hasnt really looked to do that 14 for Geler And its a 142 run now from a Montana State sixpoint lead to a Stanford sixpoint advantage Stop clock foul shots for Montana State Just came right behind He loves to go to his right over So hes shooting over right shoulder Puts the ball in his shooting pocket Its more difficult for him to go left because the ball is not in the shooting pocket automatically Foul was on Okara of Stanford starting to be critical now Ted in terms of these free throws and the little things See like that You cant Youre on the road You got to have those And thats the last one and one Thats the last one and one Well see Both teams at nine fouls now If youre Montana State just got to keep doing what youve been doing If youre Stanford dont think clock Think penetration And youre going to get the line And Okorei back irons it Ball tipped out and another secure for a moment by Miller Oh my thats deep And Rajosi clears it for Stanford Hodge is sitting out of the timeout for Montana State with his four fouls But were under three minutes Hes got to come back now Go Lets go Lets go cheering Lets go Geler again And Christian King for Montana State Bobcats are alive here heading towards two and a half screaming cheering Too much dribbling And up there boy And then there was a good bump Holden bumping with Geler And Holden makes the basket Timeout Fourpoint game with 216 Montana States all you wants a chance Ted And you know theyre four points down You know they need some stops Stanfords got to take care of the ball They cant get cautious Theyve got to continue to attack Theyve got to get the ball in Okores hands Geler obviously going to his left or his right shoulder square You want him and Okara inside But with two minutes its anybodys ball game really You see the Bobcats have one timeout remaining Two for Stanford And any foul will be a twoshot foul now And the possession arrow belongs to Stanford So that sets it up just outside two minutes And the other uh the value tonight with the ball in Okores hands and your point about Montana State needing to get out of his hands he has 21 points Hes drawn eight fouls tonight Well they if theyre a half step behind his ability to penetrate and get into the paint and create contact is really really good And hes got size so he can finish inside So theyve got to double him and make somebody else beat him Ball bounced inside Raosi up top Okara got the lane and then the loose ball picked up Braosi in the right spot Stanford got a little bit of break there cuz the ball was knocked loose Went right to the Stanford player for the basket So Montana States got to use make good choices right here Good decisions Dont panic Wow thats deep Now theyve theyve gone to some threes here down the stretch It hasnt worked No it hasnt Actually you can get threes by creating contact and getting to the line I dont like this matchup necessary to get away Give him some room Long bounce pass there Long bounce pass there And Rajosi finishes Stanford does a really nice job of stepping through at the post Montana State need Oh thats deep again Theyre kind of hope and prayer here right now in the threepoint deep Live by the sword die by the sword Ted And now Stanford can feel comfortable Not done yet but they hit a minute to go with an eightpoint lead and the ball and Geler going to the line I dont know that Geler is a guy you want to foul but at the same time you cant just let the clock run out So um I think Montana State rightly so panicked a little bit from the standpoint of thinking they needed a three and to get it You have to have a rhythm to your shots and you have to get shots you can make You can still get three by going to the basket getting fouled and get the oldfashioned threepoint play See on the side as Geler shoots free throws Whats ahead for Stanford which includes a trip down to the California desert Thats where theyll play Minnesota Theyll also play a second game in the desert and the rest of those games home games Mentioned the trip to the desert and then one road game at San Jose State and one neutral sight game in Phoenix against Colorado Thatll be their noncon King Boy those shots just havent gone here late for them Well Montana State at le 61 to 55 I dont know the exact time of that but it was a while back Theyve only scored four points the Bobcats in a long stretch here coming to the end Yeah I think Stanford sped them up a little bit and the shot shots quit going for Montana State But boy you got to give Montana State really credit for the job well done The final score is going to be 10 plus and thats not going to reflect the closeness of Not at all Exactly Mike This said this was a game that Montana State has lost here in the last five or six minutes And another tough three And that ones made by McMahon But its going to be too little too late for Montana State And Stanford boy did they get pushed tonight They did You might say that they escaped in some ways You got to give Montana State credit for coming on the road and playing a hell of
