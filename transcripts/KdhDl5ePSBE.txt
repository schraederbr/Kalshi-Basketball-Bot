you know hes hes got a lot on his plate in a very short period of time and hes navigated it very well so far so were set to go the first ever Atlantic Coast Conference basketball game for the SMU Mustangs and Virginia controls a tip a lot of new faces very little experience returning for this Cavalier team fact that man right there Day Day AES in his first year after transferring from Kansas State McNeely their big threepoint shooter but lays it off underneath in a slam by Buchanan wow a good play by uh on the pass that time but mcne Buchanon a good start for him but Virginias going to be very deliberate Tom they take a lot of time off the shot clock and they try to wear you down at both ends of the floor offensively and defensively SMU extremely deep theyll be 10 11 players that may get double digits heres a guy theyre really excited about that one Stripped Away but the big fella a native of turkey and they have a pair of them on this Mustangs roster CET yatu theyre expecting huge things from him in the future hes only a freshman yeah you know what big presence in the post hes a very good passer out of double teams which Virginia will do a lot of but uh that was a bang bang play great find by Miller and the big guys playing off of uh penetration here early Applause U their second leading rebounder played for the Turkish under 20 European championships where he averaged 14 points and eight rebounds a game heavily recruited by schools all over the country he hits one of two you know Ill say Ill make the comment that it seems like International big guys are always good passers of the basketball uh they make good decisions and with his size hes going to be able to find people 21 lead through the first minute of the game roie with the basketball thought about the bounce pass and keeps a dribble alive one of only three players with any experience with the Cavaliers from a year ago and for three its off the mark by Elijah Saunders coming off a big performance against Florida with 19 points well the thing for him his threepoint shot has come alive speaking of come alive yigu with a nice hes again theyre doing nice twoman game there and uh you know what you keep him mobile you wont be able to double team him McNeely thought about it dumps it off to Buchanan lefthanded jump and that was altered very active early in this game is jigu well well see its a big front line for SMU thats why they offensive rebound so well three points try no good by Matt cross transferred over after being an all Atlantic 10 performer the last two years at umat hes a good Music player nams a lefthander knocks it down I think hes got to be more aggressive offensively especially in this game theyre going to need points from him too tall on the feed inside and Virginia with the basketball and a onepoint lead yeah see yeah Virginias going to be its very tough to feed in the post mcney and hes off the Mark hes been a 50 threepoint shooter so far this year thats his game and thats a good challenge though by cross that was a tough shot Edwards picks up the dribble bounce pass left Tander how about the big fella 72 265 and hes only a freshman you know this is this this is kind of a throwback game with the centers getting getting touches inside back in your day yeah right and roie all the way to the glass kisses it in thats his game hes not really a threepoint shooter but very good midrange very good taking it to the hole you getu again and defended well that time by Buchanon another thing you can do well is off the dribble and thats tough for another Center to Applause Music defend heres the look inside uh really good seal off thats a nice pass hes able to finish with both hands inside very skilled and then for Virginia RO with the take all the way Applause in I tell you the SMU time will be happy with playing twopoint basketball theyre okay theyre not you know okay with that but better that than threepoint shots mcne their leading scorer his first basket of the game and an 85 Virginia Applause lead its going to be a reach in against roie now the thing I will say too though Tom I mean yeah its only a twopoint basket but if these guys get confidence early seeing the ball go through maybe that threepoint shot becomes a lot easier for them building an inside out instead of you know right out of the shoot hting threes inbounds play and yigu yet again he has six of the seven in fact all seven up at you Parton one of two from the line it wasnt eligible the first game but uh has started the last seven and the big man to the deck in SMU with a chance to take the lead ly Miller is there guy hes coming off for a bad game it was his only bad game of this year that was in a route of Alabama state where he went just one for 12 from the field and thats Miller the weight Forest transfer and had that rejected and here comes ases the other way for the Cavaliers Applause Music Applause got a mismatch inside thats Jacob Kofi The Freshman out of Seattle and now they get the switch back defensively he was too late taking advantage of it allowed the double Applause team ramble for the basketball Buchanans on it and a jump ball and thatll take us to a timeout it will be SMU ball when we come back 15 03 to play here in the opening half from Dallas Texas what a start for this Music guy some people just know they can save hundred um and you know thankfully go goodness theres uh some continuity with Ron Sanchez in the program um I mean Tonys a dear friend he was a teammate for mine with the Hornets um you know true Christian man and uh just wish him the best great family fantastic Guy cross just bullies his way to the basket got his own rebound and sticks it back this kids going to be a good player in this league this year yeah he had two he played in Miami then at Louisville then his two best years at UMass but I think in this game at the at the small forward and big forward is where SMU really has size advantage and Crosses a a load at 68 back checking in for the first time the senior native of New Zealand is Kan Murray and its out of bounds itll go the other way you a lot of people talk about Andy Enfield and many will remember that magical run he had at Florida G Coast he took off to USC uh he was there for the last 11 years and really did some great things uh for Trojans basketball people think of him as an offensive coach but I tell you he was quick to point out that you know over the Last 5 Years total his teams had the best field goal percentage defense in the country yeah I you know you know his teams are going to be able to throw points in a tough Challenge three that time by Endo but um you know he really is focusing hes very proud of those defensive numbers that you see and and of course you mean you look at Virginia that both of them are been in the top five well Virginia that that has been the Cavaliers m o among the best nationally the entire tenure of Tony Bennett Kofi too strong but I I really think Tom for both of these coaches theyre just starting to get a feel for their team now I mean with all the new faces you know for SMU and the new coach and the new coaching change itll be January I think before they settle in and then dont you think thats the truth for a lot of teams oh absolutely with the portal and uh recruiting and transferring uh you know its tough I put everything on my a scorecard in pencil no kidding Kofi with the touch its a three just his sixth and 22 tries this year yeah I was going to say thats uh thats not Im sure that wasnt part of The Scouting Report Virginia basketball on the tie up boy theyre really getting after boopy Miller in this game defensively hes the guy I mean and and you know theyve got a good feel for him havent played at Wake Forest um but you really got to Corral him and Ron Sanchez told us about building a wall with him and aside from those give and goes early hes had little tough sledding so closing in on 12 and 1 half to go here in the opening half and SMU with a onepoint lead getting a look at TJ palard transfer from two Saunders rejected underneath but hell go to the free throw line as thatll go who they going to get on that Saunders or I beg your pardon who they get here oh theyve really had Virginias had good success with the drive and the bounce pass inside and he gets that call because he attacks the rim leaving a point at the free throw line but this is the thing Virginia they do not get to the line very much and its one thing that they want to address that try to find somebody who can do stuff in the paint area Saunders had hit 12 of 14 from the line coming in and by the way they got jel Colbert on that foul for the STS but this is a good SMU shot clocking team we talked about that size up front L is scoring on this SMU team despite the fact that theyre very tall as Mike has talked about but three big scores on the perimeter and cber did not turn around to see that give and go coming not yig in there though theyre playing Five out they dont have a real post presence strong drive by T Murray his first basket again with you know with 72 out of the lineup they the lane looks a little more hospitable Music heres cross again banging his way underneath and a little too strong on the short hook yeah got where he wanted to go was just missed an easy Applause shot shot clocked down to seven and this is Kofi along the Baseline got into a tough angle up underneath the basket and here come the Mustangs the other way nice job cber forcing him on behind the basket bang and how about o quendo he had 20 Off the Bench including four threepointers in the route of Alabama State and hes come off the bench and thank you very much a pair of thre well why not I mean hes over 50 of the Year shooting thre so you know I Ill roll the dice with that good defense on the Interior right there by Matt Cross mmu by a point O quendo again and this one too strong and thatll be a push underneath on Kofi o quendo in his first season from SMU was eliminated in the NCAA tournament uh here you have their first ever a C basketball game mens game later tonight here on campus as that sent it out on the threepoint Try by Chuck Harris later tonight the mens soccer team will host Marshall with a chance to go to the NCAA Final Four and then of course all of that culminates tonight with a trip to the ACC football championship as SMU unbeaten during the regular year conference play faces the Clems and tigers yeah like second three of the game for Virginia like Nuke Louch SMU has announced their presence with authority in the ACC theres a name nuke my name is nuke thats going to be fun tonight and sh that be like a home game for the Tigers there going to be a lot of orange in in and around Charlotte tonight we had a chance call both teams um here on the CW Network this year coach Lashley what a job he did making the quarterback change about 3 weeks into the year going with Kevin Jennings and they have not lost a game Music since theres a look good extra passing the screen down and thats a big shot for power whos been struggling with his confidence Tom and I I think that uh you know making the first couple when youre in that kind of mode you see that first one go in the game changes a little bit know powers an interesting guy he was a fivestar High School recruit he shoots there and he a little too strong and he committed to Dukes that tells you all you need to know he went to Duke right out of high school and he didnt get much playing time there and he transfers now to Virginia but has been slow to get Applause going Cavaliers with a twopoint lead nine minutes to go well had the reputation certainly as a shooter coming out of high school great defense by Ambrose Hilton on the rejection there Harris lays it off big man back in the game and doing what hes done the whole game hes got nine you know theyve done a nice job getting inside and uh and Credit Credit IG whos always had his hands ready hes had some good catches in the post I mean they think yigu is going to be among the best players in the country maybe not necessarily this year but it wont be long well hes certainly has hes made his impact on this game early on he wound up getting it down to SMU in North Carolina where his final two choices on where to go to college and SMU thrill looking him run the floor and then he gets fouled from behind by bu Canon and hes the presence that the tar Hills are missing this year uh you know inside with uh Armando botts career coming to an end yeah they could have used him for sure tar Hills losing again uh the other night at home to Alabama and will probably slip certainly will slip out of the top 20 Duke had a huge win the other night in the conference at home I was I was so stunned as jigo uh gets the first one youre watching CW Courtside Saturday presented by All State youre in good hands uh Duke uh beating Auburn second ranked Auburn the other night at Cameron indor stadium that was the first time that Bruce Pearl had ever been a head coach at Cameron indor yeah I mean its you know you think its a given but a lot of these games are played on neutral courts you know so and Im glad to see that the home and homes are starting to come back into it that just adds another level to it like going to Cameron going to the Smith Center you going going to Kansas I mean its its its so much better than neutral Court without a Applause doubt one point lead for the Mustangs under eight to go Ro defended by Miller coming off the screen mcney hes not hit a three in the game so far Jumper by saers is short no offensive rebounds for Virginia thats not thats not part of their MO we talked about how good SMU is there but Virginia there is just concern getting back defensively instead of sending a couple people to the to the board thats a nice little move right there to the basket by Chuck Harris hes a nice player spent the last three years uh at Butler until a season ago and he came to SMU averaging 13 points per game and here comes boy the other way left handed lays it in hes fouled silly foul by mcne yeah you just have to let that one go Tom and nobody is going to catch poopy Miller in the open court yeah I mean forget it and theyll go to the line when we come back fivepoint lead for the stanks go very far from I think hes trying to coach at all five of them well he already got a win against Temple this year Miller completes a threepoint play and the largest lead of the game stands at six for the Music Mustang look so they theyve really theyre defending all levels right now very well but theyve really taken the threepoint shot away from Virginia only two makes so far thats excellent defense right there wow theyre so long they can close out from a long way away Ro little floater off the glass well done his second basket and that was that was great defense it was just trumped by a better better shot that was tough going left finishing Music right stepping out on every screen when Miller has the ball and thats beautiful right there on the pick and roll beautifully done well thats what you know but hes been the guy thats been setting the and you know picking him up as a roller has been an issue for Virginia so far that is 12 points and you know what its its a great use of him to get him out of the low post so you cant double team I given power a lot of respect a double team forces the Aon throw and Edwards head fake no call may have been bumped and here comes Saunders probably should have given it up earlier and strip from behind by by Miller and that hit off the leg of Saunders right in between a shorter guy coming over from from the weak side and watch this hustle we talk about Miller and his speed not only stops the play but gets the ball back too great chase down man I wish Just One Day One Moment In Time I can run like that just F you up 20 seconds yeah well I know I could use I could run like that for about 5 ft then it slowed down dramatically Im telling you Im going to be on a campaign all year long cuz I asked you a question today before the game which I I just cannot believe it I know you dont want me doing it but Im going to do it and look who knocks down and three here is Harris wow guy 46 47 overall so if you want him taking more of his shots from behind the ark this is eerily reminiscent of the Florida Virginia came out strong had a lead and then the Gators went on a 152 Music run that lead got down to five by halftime but it was all floor in the second half mcne wide open roie and its good right at the shot block buzzer Ros had a nice start to this one yeah but that was that was a really tough find by McNeely too he was in up in the air and in trouble thats bu by Saunders and thats his second theyre going to get him out of the game see that I mean you had the big help over and he just thats just knowing where your teammates are going to be and he knew he had a spot up guy in the corner still a good find top three all time in the history of the Atlanta Coast Conference in points rebounds and blocks Fade Away by Harris no good yigu the rebound good pass pass for Miller thats way out and another rebound yigu on the feet inside we talked about it now thats the shot you want boy Miller taking a three he under 30 but that offensive rebounding for SMU so dangerous I want to finish that thought Mike jinsky is still the only player in the history of the ACC that still ranks in the top six in scoring rebounding and BL and not in the College Basketball Hall of Fame that is Criminal criminal and Im going to go to B for this all year long I mean it because I watched your play although this guy might break your record before hes Music finished Pacific Life creating Financial Security for more than 150 years and it seems like this guy is a veteran of that long you go IGA has been terrific inside Terio quendo from three and then Virginia they started off really hot time inside but is uh theyve calmed down lately and right now SMU is matching them from behind the threepoint line 3022 SMU shooting a whopping 50 from the field out rebounding Virginia 179 Cavaliers just nine of 22 from the field 40 well and Tom I want to thank you for that going out I I will never campaign for something and that um thats for others to decide I I was blessed to play with some great teams and some great players and and Im proud to call those guys my brothers today and you were saying youre still on a team got to the national championship game lost to Kentucky yep and uh were on a were on an open Tech thread uh we all stay in touch its been a wonderful way to communicate and to give you an idea of how old Mike is he did not play for Mike Jes the last one Im from as I told people there Im from the Old Testament Mike was the New Testament well you a l a savior was born yeah and and John sh one of his disciples thats right so I tell I told him about Moses and pharaoh and thats very nice all were under four to go now until half time Virginia needing some offense here and theyre looking for mcne and they have just defended him so well hes not generally going to beat you off the drill TR to fade away there thats a tough shot over the sevenfooter yeah good challenge that time but you know mcneel you they teams can really lock in on him until somebody else steps up for Virginia as a primary score SMU SMU leaving some points on the board on a second trans try Applause there shot blocked down to five knocked out of bounds by Edwards itll belong to the Cavaliers with less than two seconds on the shot clock I invite you to stay tuned for our halim show presented by Subaru love anything grander than love its what makes Subaru Subaru there is nothing grander than theres not mcne at the horn short here come the Mustangs trying to add to an eightpoint lead Miller thought about it and had that one stripped away that was very good defense by isan Sharma freshman out of the Canada I tell you what Virginia has done a nice job of keeping Miller under control he really has not been a huge factor in this game so far thats in theu run today he has 14 of there half the shot clock at one how about that and he may have been bumped McNeely his first three of the game I mean if hes going to make shots like that you have to shake his hand and run down the other end of the floor that was ridiculously hard well you can see you brought it up the first minute of the game as heres a three by Edwards no good and the rebound to the Cavaliers so here we are with under two to go and trying to do what they did against Florida three nights ago and yeah and Id say the pace of scoring in the game right now favors UV um you know they want to they want to keep this one under 70 if they can well thats just a miscommunication here infrequently used Anthony Robinson comes in and that should have been an easy L for a dunk and and this is a very tough front line for SMU to throw a a lot against so and you know you got a guy coming in whos you know hasnt had a lot of court time late in the first half so 120 to play in the opening Applause half Miller takes a seat o quendo Has Come Off the Bench and hit a couple of Threes but heres the start of the game and thats an offensive foul good defense by the aforementioned Anthony Robinson there yeah and thats going to its going to give him a little bit of confidence know nice job in the post keeping his body active and you see the elbow coming out thats what got him the foul call but you know with with with Buchanan not in the game that he really feels you to that he can has a huge Advantage inside one minute to go here in the first half Virginia trying to draw closer than five and nearly taken away on the cross court pass by roie well and thats a good anticipation good defense knowing that where that crosscourt receiver was Harris making a good good defensive play back back Applause and how about right there getting Sharma involved the only averages one point per game in nine minutes per game and dont look now here come the Wahoos and two freshman coming in in his last two minutes and making an impact in the game Big lift for this team nice catch and shoot there we had the good defensive play on the other end by Robinson Applause twopoint game 41 ticks remain coming up Wednesday Inside the NFL our Pros take a look ahead in this weekends games bill bich has his game plan Chad Johnson predictions you dont want to miss Inside the NFL Wednesday night Eastern a central on the CW privilege of meeting and and we wish him nothing but the best no I would I would agree with that I met him a wonderful gentleman um but belich would certainly be a departure in style a little bit yeah Im sure they Im sure the triangle media would love having him come into I dont know if they would or not hes great on TV wasnt so great with the media as a coach no o quendo lays it off for Harris no good and Virginia now with a chance to tie or take the lead that halftime will spend a timeout out with 23 seconds remaining well were sitting next to President Bush so we got to get in something with politics today right all right here you go Mr President if youre looking for a Cable News Network that represents and respects all Americans you have a new home with news Nation see why newsnation is Americas most trusted Cable News Network to find newsnation on your screen or go to newsnation nowcom I Ive had a chance for many many many years to know President Bush his days in the Baseball World course part owner the Texas Rangers here for a long time and then uh Weve run into one another uh in recent years place where he goes regularly in Florida that I happen to be visiting friends he look I dont care what your politics are thats not what were talking about here as a guy yep he is one terrific guy how about his fundraiser on the bike ride that he does and the painting that he does to raise money for the best and I tell you too I mean Laura I think one of the more outstanding first ladyes weve had too and he has long ties of course to the state of Texas and uh the George Bush Presidential centers right across the street from Moody kisin all right here we go were down to 10 roie with a basketball Saunders will set a screen no he wont set a screen they open it up for roie to the basket and no good and knocked out of bounds and UVA will have it with z 42 left little surprised SMU had a foul to give in that situation they didnt have to let him get a shot they could have taken that with about five seconds on the clock this is going to be a tough Applause up thers yes s the buzzer does it count no no it will not count he cant under he cant catch yeah its its got to be Butler and then to Mississippi State who by the way Mississippi state is only lost one game and just drilled pit the other night by 20 plus the AC or the SEC top to bottom is unbelievable this year dominating the top 25 lets see if snu they need to have a really strong first four minutes here time try to get get a lead and get some Applause separation well thats a matchup they like but uh air and throw tough one to handle for cross underneath the basket in uba with a takeaway Saunders thought about pulling the trigger thought better of it you know some of the the the big scores in this game for both teams uh were pretty quiet in the first half McNeely being one and the tandem of BJ Edwards and boy Miller theres Saunders left hand airball well I mean Virginia has no double figure scores at this point and SMU only has one so as there really hasnt been that second person or third and we talked about all the minutes of Mustang players as heres a foul thatll go against roie like to remind you youre watching CW Courtside Saturday brought to you by healthcaregov new law lower prices enroll today but in there nine games this year six times theyve had four or more players in double figures talking about SMU theres a bump y that was you to that was that was a pretty nice job by McNeely selling that foul Yu that is his second foul well keep an eye on that I mean hes basically been their offense in this game outside of a couple of Threes by endo and that was a really cheap one to pick up as a second two Murray gets a start here in the second half mcely off the screen to Murray for three neither team has scored a point to start this second half and thats Saunders I believe over the back and if it is thats his third yep Music they have to get him out of the game and man thats a hit for Ron Sanchez and the waho he averages better than 10 points per game the only other guy averaging double figures and hes coming off a career game is you know you touch down in the open against Applause Florida still not a point yeah yeah cross has been hes hes been a big hes been a big get for Andy anfield this year too and hes been quiet yeah cross had just the one basket in the first Applause half thats good defense there by BJ Edwards off the screen and thats going to be a foul against cross tried to fight through that screen a little too Applause hard number two on Alex or earlier spent a year at Miami spent a year at Louisville then got his feet underneath him at UMass well he was a mighty good player for that first team all Atlantic Music 10 call on the floor stands that was the uh taking a look at it and you know just to see if there was anything else there and him fighting through the screen and it should been common foul and when cros runs into you man youre going to know it he goes 67 230 may not look like it on TV but that cats put together now and hes hes hes been a double double machine for them this year I mean hes been really solid on the boards and thats an area you know Virginias hanging in there in the glass against SMU theyre only down six in that category youd expect that to be a much wider margin and at one point during the first half this was heres kofy Kofi came off the bench in that first half and gave him a big threee shot clocked down to five McNeely lets it Fly and this is a onepoint Virginia lead and this is what theyre going to do theyre going to grind that offensive 30 second shot clock down if they hit threes at the end that is going to be problematic for Applause SMU cross lost a handle once again thats his second turnover this half trying to do too much off the dribble against this team theyre really quick digging in theres roie Bo he had a great look right there and was a little bit short Mustangs in need of a bucket Applause that an offensive foul on Miller no its like theyre going to call it on hold thats his third that was that was a little bit of a cheap foul I mean he did reach in on a guy Defender sliding by him but didnt look like a ton of contact boy I mean hes got to be wondering the these two fouls against him thatll send him to the bench in this half theres another international players are used to playing a lot more physical game than maybe whats allowed here in the in the college level so there may be a bit of a transition for him with regard to that great speed and a foul is going to be whistled on Miller as he got behind The Cutting roie who will go to the line to shoot a pair heres the I mean Ro is really good around the basket back cutting getting fin and Music scams Miller with his second Applause foul every match every move every moment WWE NXT delivers the action every Tuesday at Eastern 7 Central and this Tuesday no difference catch NXT right here on the CW one of the things Virginia does Tom is they dont foul they defend and dont foul and then SMU already has four personals this half I mean if Virginia gets into the penal into the bonus early that could be another issue Ron Sanchez has to feel very good now granted we still have 16 minutes plus left in this game but I mean hey so far so good for the Cavaliers trying to expose that matchup across you know against against Virginias defense historically very tough to impose your will against it now you know SMU doesnt play super fast thatll be against Murray and well get back to that here in just a second but this is a three that gave the Cavaliers lead McNeely is second and the ninth threo Advantage for the waho as Mustangs we dont just challenge expectations we sh just a great great player John Cate great assist guy see I go all the way back though to the days Im old enough youre not Im old enough to remember the Barry Park Hill days and dust Gerard great player the miracle land over in 76 Andy Enfield looking on not not real happy with where his team is right now and and the thing is with Virginia theyre theyre even tougher to play with when when they have the lead because they can really grind you offensively then lets just keep an eye how long all these possessions go Tom well those two free throws were the first two points in over four minutes this half for SMU I mean both teams Stone Cold to begin the second half roie crossover move good bounce pass and theyre going to get cross with his third person thats the fifth foul for SMU two away from the bonus and Virginia may end up shooting 35 free throws in this game if uh we have two more quick ones here McNeely pitches it out to power and thats way off the Mark I mean way off but in this but in this situation I mean yeah you know the shot really miss but it was a dead ball and Virginia gets an opportunity to come back and uh you know set their defense not not a lot in the open court for SMU in this game they really slow down that man right there mly and theres a reach in and a left hook and thats a big basket first field goal the second half for the Mustangs in the first in the game for Jerel Colbert the transfer junor from State hes coming off a big game against Alabama State 14 points for him or 14 minutes 107 rebound so great production he got a lot of options on this SMU team Y and thats good defense right there by BJ Edwards Miller thought about it Ro has defended Miller quite well and theyve helped on double teams shot that cross I think normally would have taken just a little uh lack of confidence what this guys a good looking player now you know he tomys got a pro body and hes really strong can carry it all the way to the rim you talk about a journey for okendo he started at Florida Southwestern went to Georgia for two years then went to Oregon Geor this guy was a good player he let him in scoring in backto back years and theres a turnover by roie and okendo we got making sure that uh that was a veteran they honored before the game but heres the look a great split of the double team that time and theres the strength going through the play yeah quendo hes been all over the country hes had all time zones covered and theres power going in and uh yeah oh bless her heart oh man saw my little girl last night well be Music back gets the gets the Kentucky job so it was really uh lot of dominoes falling with those moves Mark pop with a big one today I think the big blue taking on Gonzaga later on tonight yeah there have been some great nonconference games cant remember a year where they were ever better and more frequently Edwards to the basket had it blocked and then wide open from three and unable to get it as its tapped out of bounds by SMU good look there by Harris whos been quiet and and Tom its you know I Ill reiterate its you know theyre a great offensive rebounding team you get a good second look you usually do from three on the offensive rebound but uh the Mustangs have not been able to capitalize on those Second Chance opportunities only four points yeah in fact SMU has not had an offensive Rebound in this half and were just about 7 minutes into it w this is exactly I mean you know talking about the pace Ron Sanchez wanted Kofi with a basket and hell go to the Applause line well youre talk about guys stepping up with foul trouble and you get your big guys Kofi with a tough lefthanded finish you know he has not started a game this year but does average eight points but playing big minutes out there right now without Buchanan on the floor yeah he was the first Virginia true freshman to score 10 or more points in each of his first three games as a Collegian going all the way back to 2008 so hes more than capable Big Time recruit out of Seattle tie game here and thatll be a bump by Murray trying to defend o Applause quendo personal for the team Music Applause Applause thats great team defense right there and look at Virginia getting to the floor and the possession arrow will keep it down at that end but that is outstanding defense and of course thats no surprise for Virginia yeah you just you you you grind it they they grind you on both ends of the floor and they dont give you good looks at the end and you can see this you team a different team without yiga out on the floor Tommy they you dont have to pay attention as much to Colbert inside well they were out of time on the shot clock tried that lob to Ambrose Hilton I mean you look at you know arguably as Millers going to come back but you got Miller thats been on the bench you mentioned yigu and you throw in Cross and now yigu is going to come backu I mean were getting down now to the the final 12 and2 its a tie game the big thing for IGA he has got to understand three fouls and uh and play Within himself he cant pick up that fourth early Saunders comes back for Virginia he has three well Andy anfield really had no choice he had to get him back on the floor with those three fouls too strong long rebound comes out to kof shot clock at 15 now on the offensive rebound Kofi pulls up to leave him alone and he knocks it Applause down big minutes has three assists to go along with his points as well so really giving them a lot out on the floor yeah eight points and thats what Kofi averages and thats number four on Saunders I do believe thats a 25 ft away from the basket boy thats a big foul right there for UVA Kofi Big Time minutes off the Cavaliers bench in a twopoint lead this is a big game for both of these teams even its only the first conference games I mean lets be honest about it here now outside of Duke and you could say Clemson so far right I mean everybody else is still trying to find their way so if you can steal one for SMU protecting Home Port for Virginia getting a road on the win thats a big deal oh no question and uh you know its a big deal that you know this first game a little bit of pressure on SMU yeah they want to perform well especially at Applause home too strong for o quendo but he got his own rebound sticks it back hes had a nice game and I tell you what I mean that was a tough finish and SMU has really not had any clean looks at the basket Virginia has challenged everything its 12 for Applause Endo McNeely and knocks down to three and hes fouled got undercut it looked by endo and mckneely with his third three of the game and a chance for an Ever So Rare fourpoint play like coming around and just no hesitation on his part and thats a thats a mental lapse weve seen two fouls on either end that you know that one you cant give up you know just get a hand up on the shot and then the fourth personal foul for Saunders really H Virginia and he converts it I tell you this you know that against you know a fourpoint lead for Virginia in this game is bigger than a fourpoint game in most against most teams McNeely now a 12 and he averages 13 and we still have just under 11 to go theyve done a really good job on yigu boy thats two bad fouls on the show off of that screen that Virginias picked up Buchan in no need to pick up that foul you know I know you want to keep you want to keep Miller going laterally but not at that expense boopy Miller we talked about was uh 0 for seven from three for 12 from the floor against Alabama State youre figuring okay you know an off night well Virginias done a nice job on him defensively here is Miller well no no disrespect to Alabama state but they can afford a bad night with him against that team not in this league you know hes going to have to have numbers like he had last year for Wake Forest and like hes had earlier this year and he averaged 16 points three assists was among the conference leaders in field goal percentage and theres a three by McNeely and its now a sevenpoint lead for Virginia time out Andy infield and the body language for SMU not real positive right now good timeout by Andy infield to try to calm down Virginia but this is uh this is you know I talked early in the game I thought Virginia might have to make 14 threes and they did have one earlier this year against Villanova game like that theyve got eight right now three of 16 uh you know Ron Sanchez told us about SMU having using full core pressure I wonder if this is the time when its time to start applying it Rs family when he was seven moved to the Bronx and he said he grew up loving the Yankees lived only a couple of blocks from the Yankees Stadium I knew I liked him oh yeah Dr Runner Bo three pointer there by cross I was a Yankee fan when I was born in 59 so youre I give it up yeah dont front run this all right fair fair enough but uh boy that was that was a huge shot by cross coming out of the timeout to get good positive possession front Applause runner I knew Id get fire up Nick Neely Fade Away tough shot there and heres cross once more short didnt follow his own shot that was right on line Applause too all right were under nine and a half to go it is a fourpoint Cavaliers lead Roadie little floater not going to go and here comes SMU the ponies are running and theres Miller to the rack he got well and there all of a sudden the pace has changed since that timeout SMU now getting up and down the floor so just like that seven is down to two quick 0 spurt good feed to Buchanan and not there and now a chance to tie or take the lead with 835 to go always love to see how teams react to timeouts in those situations so far SMU has done really well with that one by Andy anfield with 10minute Applause Music Mark heres the I mean he just so his step is so quick talked about not defending if you can in that time not taking the foul and you can argument that there was enough there for a threepoint opportunity theres only five on the shot clock thats a tough shot and not going to go down and theres a shot to the mouth inadvertently yigu took one I think from Buchanan and uh grabbing that jaw see that elbow by Buchanan no intent Music full court pressure you suspected we might and this the one thing that uh Virginia lacking this year and they theyve tried to settle on uh DayDay ases but like a true point guard for this club and its you know one of the strengths of Tony Bennetts teams throughout the years theyve always had that veteran point guard Ki Clark I think was a dean of students there by the time he was finished but um no true point out there for the Cavaliers right now all right toward at the 8 Minute Mark now heres McNeely and had it taken away tried to lay it off for Edwards and heres okendo with that body and hell draw the foul taking it to the hoop against Sharma and theyre getting out in the open floor and theyre being aggressive and theyre and theyre attacking the basket theres no shot blocker out there um you know just the a complete mindset change for SMU they were very stagnant in the halfcourt time but theyve been terrific in the open floorida you we talked about okendo two years at Georgia as hes short on that free throw his first year he led the team in scoring started every game then his second year more of a backup left went to Oregon barely ever played I mean he played in every game but only got three starts and decid he try and finish up here and so far its been been a good decision he hits one of two to make it a onepoint Applause Music Applause game mcney a dribble along the Baseline with 738 to go 10 on the shot clock Saunders in the game with four and thats him and now a chance to take the lead Applause SMU wide open is cross for the lead in and out hes had a number of those today yeah that was a good look by Edwards too cross able to get his feet set hit a three early in the half but hasnt been able to follow it Music up Sharma pull up fade away and track down by Chuck Harris heres o quendo boy neither team can buy one from downtown in this half one of eight Applause SMU and three of 10 Virginia 6 and a half to go its a onepoint lead for the Cavaliers on the road tried to force that bounce pass and boy Virginia got a break on a hold right there cuz that would have been a turnover well and the thing here is it accomplishes a couple things they were deep into the shot theyll go below 10 seconds on every shot clock for the rest of this game I guaranteed not only that but they get a foul they stop the clock here and they get some free throw opportunities so he got three on Cross he got three on yigu mentioned Saunders has four for the Cavaliers its the 18 foul so one and one and Buchanan knocks down the first one his first trip to the line hes only eight of 21 from the free throw strike on the year I was going to say massive two to hit the if you miss the you know that front end of the oneonone its an empty possession for you but yeah well he did not look like an eight for 21 free throw shooter on that trip well he took the words right out of my mouth that release that great back be a nice follow through threepoint gain SMU with the ball try double team in the corner they swing it cross in the corner to quendo T good look good ball movement good ball reversal Virginia really loaded up on the strong side third three of the afternoon by endo and with 545 to go were noted up right and mcne cant breathe out there offensively hes got Harris in his shirt and holding his shirt Saunders to the rack and thats going to be SMU ball it was a 30 second violation shot clock Applause violation theres that good extra pass by cross and but see thats the Applause thing when youre going to go deep into the shot clock you got to have guys who can all right I go I can finish and do something inside and uh Saunders has struggled in the game Saunders coming off an outstanding game against the Gators where he had 19 points and five rebounds he does not have a field goal in this game Boss swings it o quendo again why those two been magic its been the cross assist to the Endo 3 the last two Applause possessions o quendo now with 19 coming off a 20po game against Alabama State and Harris foul yeah wow hold on Harris heres the look good find weak side you know that guy spotting up along the Baseline and this is the thing that McNeely President Bush likes it but this the thing about mcney time he runs he runs without the B so well he forces those grabs and Applause holds its a front of the one and one nine team fouls against SMU 74 Virginia so with just under five to go the next foul against SMU and its two and impr probably outscoring SMU at the free throw line in the game so far thats a surprise yeah its you knowu does a lot of damage from the free throw line yigu the big story in the first half its been o quendo in the second here is jigu what a beautiful spin move you know what he saw the double team he was going to go middle he saw the big double team coming and in if youre Bean you have to take away that b Baseline spin if thats where the helps coming from Applause Music Applause 420 to go ukan didnt even look for the shot and he was wide open and now he bounces it off his foot and SMU making this little run with boy Miller out of the game too so that enter of itself a little bit of good sign well they just trying to find o quendo all the time let him do a thing he picks up his dribble shot clock at 11 theyll reset yigu setting the high screen and Harris couldnt use it and McNeely will be f for the foul and thatll be a one and one when we come back the big fella red hot in the first half quiet in the second half but a big one there and a threepoint lead for the Mustang 50 years Tom brenaman yeah and its been Isaac mcne filling it up in the second half but how about Endo hes been hitting threes hes been taking it inside their big guys have been a little quiet and uh oopy Miller getting into it lets see how he does in the last 352 of this game and if youre wondering normally you see that spelling of O qu u n d o pronounced Endo but his family pronounces it Endo kid who grew up in Titusville FL Florida hes the second most famous person out of Titusville Florida Chris Collins our Applause producer front end of the one and one by Chuck Harris an 82 free throw shoot this is a really good free throw shooting team 75 on the year and that they havent been there and you know they they have changed their mindset and you know I think its just end of this game their attempts are going to go up all right Miller checks back in and after hitting the two free throws Harris to the bench 350 to go and SMU sparked by that timeout that threepointer by Matt cross has open now a fivepoint lead over the Cavaliers big trip for uba shot blocked down to 10 mcne beautiful bounce pass and kofy missed the duck oh my goodness did everything they wanted to do got they got the ball out of McNeils hands but those those are tough to give away on the road we saw a couple of those in ubas practice yesterday Miss dunks look at Cross I dont think that pass was intended for him I think they were looking for a quendo on the other side of the Applause floor oh here it is this is one you get teased about if you win the game but uh oh boy on the road in a lowc scoring game but again thats you know but thats where smus defense is going to be Tom they want to get the ball out of mcneels hands and they want to cover the Three cross cant buy one today and he is a 76 free throw shooter this should be a threepoint game where he not for the Mis dunk a moment ago instead its a fivepoint game were under three to play roie Kofi looking down low for Saunders and hell go up strong and draw the foul thatll be number four on yigu well nice job sniffing out the mismatch that time they had Ry Miller on him in the low box you oh he he tried to come late but he picks up the by being late he picks up the foul Yu at 16 points to go along with six rebounds thats now his fourth foul and Saunders one of two make it two of three from the line and hes I mean hes 86 on the year so you know know that that Miss a little oneof young man out of Phoenix Arizona transferred from San Diego State and he hit backto back free throws its a threepoint game with 241 left in Dallas hes kind of the quintessential 68 UVA guy strong look at Miller are you kidding me thats that speed that Miller possesses the that they had everybody cleared out over run the weak side and no help defensively thats a huge bucket in what has been backto back quiet games for Miller and now a takeaway for SMU with 210 to go trying to add to a fivepoint lead Andy infield screaming instructions from his sideline in their losses this has been Virginias problem turnovers in critical situations you way too many in losses to Tennessee heres Applause Miller and last touch what a save in the Hustle by cross and thats well not doing it offensively but that a huge recycle shot clock at 10 and this is BJ Edwards now on the switch theyve got a mismatch underneath now Virginia shot clock at three Millers going to have to let it fly air oh thats not a good possession there by SMU no and Ill tell you what Ro did a nice job of keeping him in front McNeely got blown by that time that was a terrific finish but in this last possession well he got clopped yeah and he was up and at the whole Arena was looking for the n one and that would have been number five on Saunders right now full court pressure fivepoint lead Miller goes to the bench he has four fouls both teams will be in the double bonus or at least another foul against Virginia and both will be in and they will foul again McNeely just throws it up there looking for a foul and didnt get a call yeah that was a nice job I think by the referees not bailing him out and here is the 10th foul Harris will go to the free throw line with really a chance not quite yet but certainly walking uh down the runway and putting this sing on Ice if he can knock down a couple well you know pressure up take some time off the clock and then just defend the threepoint line willing to give up a two boy that boy the Miss buunk is really looming large right now three for three from the line is Parris where hes an 82 free throw shooter hes a native Virginia a Ashburn Virginia well and all of their guys except IG holu are are really high shooting free throw percentage which is a great endgame thing to have it sure is all right were under a minute sevenpoint game Ro he dribbled it out of Applause bounds and Sanchez wants a Applause timeout its been a long road trip for uba they had to leave Charlottesville go all the way down to Gainesville Florida and uh then you know flew here after spending the night in Gainesville on Tuesday came here Thursday spent the night Thursday night practice yesterday spent the night last nine will leave after the game today Tom lets take a look at todays player of the game brought to you by Progressive keys to Progressive program providing vehicles to deserving veterans helping our heroes Drive their lives forward learn more at keys to progresscom its Cario o oend 19 points been terrific from the threepoint line hes been getting inside as well using his body five rebounds really nice job for by the senior and this is a the one thing we havent touched on a lot this is a older SMU team as opposed to the Youth of Virginia call the floor stands 563 will be put on the game Applause clock so what a sports weekend if you werent with us for uh SMU their fans their student body their alums you know last night the womens volleyball team knocked out and in the round to 32 of the NCAA tournament first ever ACC mens basketball game here today and theyre trying to get a win less than a minute away from doing so in a couple of hours from now their mens soccer team trying to advance against Marshall into the final four by the way two other ACC teams are in action number two pck plays against Vermont and number eight Wake Forest plays number one Ohio State so you have three teams in the final four and socer and I feel left out a little bit because I found out the president of SMU is here today at this game and he is flying to Charlotte tonight to watch SMU play Clemson I could have hitched a ride back home well you you should have thought about that ahead of time but yeah you know all the high rollers are flying down to Charlotte for that football game well that leaves me Im no Im no roller Holy Roller yeah exactly and the ACC Championship tonight we were with you every Saturday on the CW for ACC football and SMU will play tonight against Clemson title on the line and certainly a trip to the college football playoff that has been so hotly contested with the ACC if Clemson wins would the ACC get a second team in smus only loss this year was against BYU by less than a field goal uh when by you was undefeated and blowing everybody out of the gym and ranked into top nine in the country you know what Tom its amazing how with the expansion to 12 now the argument goes is the conference going to get two are they going to get three is the three loss team going to you know just however many teams it expands the argument expands no doubt about it you know its the same when the you know when when the NCA went to 68 theres always going to be 69 and 70 that are going to be you know I think pit last year really had an argument about being left out of the tournament well they werent alone in the ACC and Jim Phillips said as much unfortunately before that SEC ACC match up last week it did not go well well I mean yeah but you got half half of the is in the top 25 so I mean its not a you know they werent a lot of upsets all right so now its a ninepoint lead with 50 seconds left Virginia a lot of work to do and not much time to do it Ro to the rack left hand no good tip no good rebound for cross and hell be fou and go to the line no threes no fouls that was the message in the Huddle by Andy Applause Enfield well you see whats coming up theyve really scheduled quite well out of conference if you will I mean they they played they being uh SMU played Mississippi State they were not part of that uh big ACC SEC challenge they will be next year they beat Washington State to win the Acure Holiday Tournament in Palm Springs played at Butler played Mississippi State now what do you think what are the odds of president Mr Bush being here for the Duke game I would think theyre very strong yeah yeah youll be here for that game yes well be there for that game we will be here for that game good Lord will and its a 10point game and SMU in its first ever Atlantic Coast Conference mens basketball game is going to come away with a win and to Virginias credit they gave it they they played their Virginia basketball it wasnt until the last 10 minutes SMU really kind of amped up the the pace of the game but uh I think if youd ask Ron Sanchez this is about where he wanted to see I mean their SMU is 20 something points underneath their season average right now thats right yeah theyre 26 points below it if somebody would have told you SMU is going to be at 62 points or 63 points you probably Sanchez would have said Ill take that yep both free throws are good roie dribbled it off his foot been a lot of that here in the last seven eight minutes of the game along with a Mis dun again I think that just goes back to Virginia not having that dominant ball handler you know an ingame Applause situation so now theyre just the warm up act they got a soccer game coming up in a couple of hours in the NCAA a trip to the final four leading up to everybody and his brother tailgating already for that ACC Championship football game tonight and the party is on at SMU the Mustangs win their first ever for mens ACC basketball game 6351 over Virginia
