seven 248 pounds almost 14 points per game just the shade under 10 rebounds per game that is third in all of the ACC ENT and Nigel pack has been a serious threepoint Factor as well for Miami theres Isaiah Wong Tom interesting decision by Steve Forbes going big to start off this game hes been going back and forth between a smaller looking and this bigger look now hes got a little undersized team out there in Miami see how these matchups play out as the game begins demon dinks and the traveling black and old gold nine and six in conference play they are four and five away from WinstonSalem did not have a midweek game as that one bounces out of bounds and that will be Miami basketball this Wake Forest team has not played Mike since last Saturday and a onepoint win at home against Georgia Tech and how you negate size is defending out on the perimeter of Miami was uh spectacular in that one defensive stretch Miami spectacular on Monday as well at North Carolina and they are on the board first after the win against earlier this week Theres omir and he is not a threepoint specialist 23 on the year but the March is going to be reluctant to go out and uh challenge him Id test him one more time on that three how about just his fourth main three of the season and once again the demon Deeks turn it over second straight possession yeah two possessions two turnovers and thats where Marsh usually makes his living on the uh on the pick and roll hes Gonna Roll scoring and a ridiculous 91 from the floor most of those shots very close to the rim if not dunks for marsh is his pack twoman game omir tough angle Marsh was there there was contact as well and a foul against the beats and it may be Wake Forest that blinks first in this matchup Marsh getting the foul right there and well see Steve Forbes goes to uh Williamson Off the Bench to go a little smaller omir is 70 from the freethrow line this season theres the University of Miami Hall of Famer Jim larenaga his 12th season on the bench as he watches omir in his second free throw so thats a threepointer and a couple of free throws for omir Applause you know any scouting reports going to start with Appleby and they are really locked in on him theyve really got to play well in that pick and roll game defensively far on the catch from Hildreth ran into omir and Miller trying to step through the double did get it away heres Monsanto for three and that bounces out to Butler time theyre having all kinds of trouble running their offense but omir not having any trouble running Applause time out on the court nor Chad OMeara seven Wake Forest zero Tom how do you negate size you run the floor but look at this defensively Wake Forest is having trouble just getting the ball into their offense at all and this is the long shot and then after that the turnover and uh omir just beating Marsh down the floor Im gonna start by him you know what I was trying to think of a comparison for him I I didnt want to go Barclay but Im gonna go way old school and go unself guys six seven big undersized Center rebounds its Louisville product yeah Ill mirror might go six seven two forty eight is a sophomore first year in the Miami program after two years at Arkansas state by the way in the Sun Belt last year he was the player of the year and the defensive player of the year in that conference well they do take Marsh out but they go with Bobby Clinton coming in off the bench so still a little bit of size out there but a little bit more athletic mirrors from Nicaragua Clinton is from Malmo Sweden Monsanto straight away knocking down a three ball we saw this movie up in Notre Dame we did he got it going 28 20 units they got they had a similar start up there as well really kind of flat and then he brought them back offensively teen straight games with a three from on set though back driving car got a piece of it Omer to follow Applause well thats what that penetration does it draws help defensively in the back nice reaction by car but it left omir is one of the Premier offensive rebounders in the league wide open two Force did struggle from threepoint distance last Saturday against Georgia Tech because that one gets poked away just 27 percent from Beyond The Arc Wong hesitation stutter step and he needs some assistance Wong trying to shake Clinton just threw it up on the backboard and went out of bounds and well stay at this end of the floor Applause Music well heres the look we talked about guarding him you want to make him go east and west not North and South Miami has been effective in that so far he can live in the paint Music oh yeah how about long hanging and scoring so silky Mike with the basketball wake only has two shot attempts in the game and both of those three were not getting anything in the lane or anything Appleby have the gamewinning free throws against Georgia Tech monsetto Catch and Release give him three why why that covers up a lot of Hills just like that points up on the board back in the game back in the little bit of Rhythm hes now two for three from Beyond the Arco mirror put the shoulder down ran into car and traveled trying to muscle his way in the basket see thats a much better matchup defensively for Wake the cars got the ability he can not only challenge when we were outside but stay in front of him off the dribble bar and his teammates have won three in a row the win against Georgia Tech also a victory at home against North Carolina and on the road at Notre Dame the game that Mike referenced where Monsanto it eight threepointers by himself they had lost four in a row prior to the threegame winning streaks but those were close Music Applause shot clock winding down against Wong comes up short pulled away by Miller in a foul committed Hildreth and Clinton in the vicinity file against wake and the canes will have the ball when we come back theyve also got to leave Music early first half lead and nor Chad omir has nine of the 11 points so far for the U how about this time this is his fourth threepointer of the year two of them have started on the first possession of game setting the tone out there but then doing what he does Bev running the floor then getting on the offensive lap by the way just his fifth career made threepointer for norchado Mir bit of a struggle against North Carolina on the road Monday only had five points and seven boards and was one of seven from the floor against the Tar Heels it was a win for Miami though long stepping back Mildred pretty good matchup with Monsanto on Wong hes got some good size and popular a little over anxious coupler call for tripping thatll be two minutes in The Penalty Box you want to see another good matchup defensively that Miami Poplar will arguably their best perimeter Defender one of them is on Monsanto so theyre trying to quiet him down but I like to match up for Wake to get see if they get Hildreth to get Wong and work on him inside get him in some foul trouble our game one of seven of the ACC today inside clipman and Hildreth found him it wasnt Wake Forest bigs they better take their guards out for dinner every once in a while because they make a living off that pick and roll inside Applause Music long Anthony Walkers come into the game for Miami number one not sure if pack was trying to find Walker with that was it deflected and the officials say its Wake Forest basketball well a pack was arguing strongly about the fact that it was deflected out but that was just an Aaron LOB most wins in school history for coach laronega 247 went over the 700th career win threshold this season ironically a win against Providence where he played collegiately and then was drafted into the NBA and then lost the game and right after that a real emotional turnaround to Maryland uh Marylands actually playing very well right now just beat Purdue Appleby twisting in the errands scoring and his first baskets heres his first shot attempt now hes the guy again with the assists he slowly get his teammates going but he will get his numbers Applause big screen set by Walker Santa Went Down recovers long with the shots tapped around Clinton Walker had a nice game against North Carolina in that win and hes going to be important today against Wake Forest size 24 points 11 boards for Walker against the heels back the other way with Appleby just so explosive to the rim get him to that right hand will be with 14 points in the gamewinning free throws in 23 seconds left against Georgia Tech back bouncing back and hitting the shot officials are saying two Mike on that one yeah but hes been special the last two games hes starting to feel a lot more comfortable in his role you and I talking chipleronega beforehand its a guy who he had to make a you know he had to make the transition between a big time sport to a facilitator and there there is the right foot right there on the line so good call long two instead of a three but still a made basket but Nigel pack say this last two 22 and a half points a game really shoot the ball well five times coach laronega has taken this program to the NCAA tournament and that includes all the way to the elite eight season ago Music how about Joseph getting up and pressure in the ball they have really been picking up Applebees extended up the floor Steve Forbes third year head coach from Wake Forest was that East Tennessee State won a Southern Conference Championship there in 2020 they won 30 games that year in the most in school in history under coach boards how about you get to londis Williams in the portal last year whos the AC player of the year and now hes got Tyree Appleby not a bad back to back at The Rim from Ina not back to back but back door that time Poplar got the switch and got Applebee inside Applause assistant threepoint difference first half Hildreth on the drive came up short Walker over the top theres Marsh with the jam and one thats his game hes going to get lobs off the pick and roll and hes also going to finish on offensive rebounding and thats you know and Jim larenagas and his team have been rebounding better this is a little tougher task today against Wake Forest I I if I shot 91 from the free throw line that was ecstatic he had he had missed in like five games tom now granted Mike he does have a fist full of Rim most of the time that was his first field goal attempt that means hes getting to the right yes so officially now Mike He is 65 of 72 from the floor and when you can remember each of your misses from the field thats something now the free throw line is a different story though for marsh yeah its inverted its pretty well expected field goal percentage season for marsh Im pretty sure that went off the backboard yes he did okay I was just looking for confirmation maybe that was thats the way he does it huh it counts either way Music Applause Music Joseph and Beverly are into the ball game for Miami this is benzner Joseph hes the defensive player Beverly a little bit better off offensively but tell you what if Isaiah wants some rest right now and they got some years some good rest minutes early as well you know Longs only got two points so far and thats Hildreth backing on down against Nigel back youre going to see that if he gets switched off and thats a smaller Slayer hes got great sides hes tried to go to that early missed a couple opportunities inside but converted that I Joe pack other end of the floor Music Applause number one and number two in scoring in the conference so not surprising we had a little bit of an offensive slugfest going here yeah Miami 79 points per game as Mike mentioned that leads the ACC almost 78 points per game for Wake Forest their fourth in the conference threepointer you have Clinton I tell you what hes really come on as the season has progressed the c42 remote on the floor I really like his game hit double digits in the win against Georgia Tech thats OMeara give them a couple of extra style points as well sweeping that one off the backboard you know Marsh isnt really a shot blocker but just his size is imposing but that was nonetheless very impressive finish Steven Geeks are eight of 11 from the floor as a team Williamson has come in for the Deeks as well number four in black and old goal this is marsh and Hildreth and for the UK connection and they get it yeah and uh really good Patience by Marsh hustles to the other end and lays it in however thats the second time that OMeara has run out and gotten a layup after a made basket this is one thing is he knows that he can beat uh Marsh in a foot race so Cameron Hildreth is from Worthing England Matthew marshes from Cornwall England they try to do it again here Music Applause Music Applause Music shot clock all the way down to two Monsanto misses the shot coach Laredo wanted to travel Applause Music Applause attack is two for three from the floor four points Applause Walker Fuller Rim fender for the game Whitman got caught looking that time uh Walker the nice just got lost on the Baseline Walker who averages three points per game Juan Duncan hes close to his average for the Junior from Baltimore Maryland number one in whites were looking at a hundred here partner again we see Miami go this route already we saw that game against Cornell earlier this season Michael both teams went over 100 107 104 Joseph Applause Music Applause by Williamson Anthony Walker just four points at North Carolina on Monday hes got two here what a b from back and its a threepoint game Music lets go Center and what a start to this one 13 points already for old beer McCains trying to defend the whole Court they have not lost at all this season 70 against BC opponents head coach Jim larenaga I want to start to this one Mike 25 22 Keynes and Deeks and three of their last four here at home so good things on the horizon potentially although this game started off a little sluggishly for the Deeks but uh it turned into a contest here Miamis won five in a row six of its last seven games the seventh straight ACC home wins omir a big factor early in this one most of the time Mike the key is if he can avoid foul trouble in those first few minutes and hes been able to do that and hes running the floor effectively as well well and I think the thing for Amir in this game marshes and the guy theyre gonna throw the ball too and hes gonna make moves inside so you know hes going to play off of misses and things like that so maybe you know it saves you a little bit as far as your fouls are concerned but omir is definitely taking advantage of his speed but you know you talked about Jim Miller and egg in his 12 years here the crowd today is fabulous this was not the way it was before he got to Miami great energy inside the building theyll be disappointed with that sequence there comes hildren foreign Applause Music Applause Music hustle back to break it up Monsanto in the corner for the three ball out of bounds on the weak side and the officials will award the ball to Wake Forest you know that was an incredible play by Applebee that shot off the side of the backboard didnt give up on the play and comes back and saves two points right there a little bit of a lacy pass in transition by Miami Music Hustle by Applebee to stay inbounds after the steal hes uh hes been playing 40 minutes a game and uh absent foul trouble hes going to be out there the whole game today Santo missed Beverly foul them Applause Ted Valentine was right there to make the call hes joined by Bill Covington Jr and Brent Hampton so if Beverly picks up the foul Germany got a little bit a late whistle there and I dont know if that ball went in I dont know if thats called Music 86 percent from the line Monsanto behind bounce hes now 32 of 37 from the strike this season for the Redshirt Junior Pembroke Pines Florida so maybe he had this game circled on the calendar Mike and down the lineup is very very solid substitution Damian Williamson graduate student from WinstonSalem North Carolinas back in Applause 78 for Miami from the floor 11 of 14 theyve made their last seven shot attempts Music oh missed from long or mirrors over the top for the foul against Miami Music and we welcome those of you who just watched Boston College win on the road in Tallahassee against Florida State 7369 weve got a onepoint game Miami and Wake Forest here in Coral Gables Florida Tom wormy Mike jaminski our outstanding ACC basketball production crew and uh PC a different team with Clinton post hes gotten into the lineup and gotten healthy they are a tough out after missing the first 13 games of the season with a foot injury for post and DC gets the win Wake Forest gets the jumper Williamson yeah his struggled with his shot this year has some injury issues so very important for him to knock down his first attempt Applause Music 201st made three of his career mites back with the Miss easy board Clinton oh thats uh this game Wake Forest playing the threepoint game four of ten and that was only Miamis second attempt theyll drip of Miss Miller came over the top stumbles Down fight for the loose ball and the arrow will favor Miami so when we come back to Keynes well have the basketball drilling by two to wake foreign Applause Music up there but it was a nice way to travel all right time to take a look at our Ford keys to the game with Mike jiminski well for Wake Forest the thing they talked about first shot defense they want to get that Miss and not allow any second chance opportunities for Miami and for the Hurricanes defend that pick and roll Appleby is just so dangerous out front scoring himself and making shots for his teammates Miami is tied with Providence for the best home record power five just the only other undefeated home team in the conference 140 for the season that was a mere work as a baseline might have stepped right on that Baseline Applause pretty nice job of funneling him to the Baseline defensively car moving his feet Monsanto has a couple of threes car is going to run all the way down and inbounds it almir had the first nine points of the game for Miami which led 113 and right now finds itself trailing by 2 2725 seven and a half minutes to go in our first half Applause one two in a row in the series against Wake Forest very close over the years Mark three and they found him well three because again Appleby in the pick and roll with Marge omir stayed with him a long time guys behind defense were gonna have to roll over on March he was wide open that is a 70 Wake Forest run Appleby just over six assists per game and that leads the ACC and a nice touch from Mack you know one word comes to my mind watching him in this game comfortable uh you know he just really looks like he has settled into a nice rhythm with Music three points on Monday at North Carolina in the win for pack and he made four threepoint baskets in the victory over the Tar Heels inside of the rim run down by Amir long full speed Beverly to the rim thats what happens on those long threes I think he caught his team a little unaware as in Miami has done a terrific job in transition its tied the game at 29 this is Carr let the defender go by finds Monsanto Marsh came down with it Williamson hoisting a three and ripping the ropes for Wake Forest and favor Marshall is going to go back up did the smart thing he didnt have total control found a wide open shooter those points for Williamson on a couple of Threes he now has 40 made for the season long and foul on the Baseline Jumper by Monsanto and hes going to the line Music heres the look on the other end it just marches size see right there he brought it down lost control of it but in the scramble Pat got lost inside Applause and thats one you know from Monsanto Wong was a little quiet offense when he comes back and makes it a threepoint play but challenge the jump shooter not foul him along the eighth best free throw shooter in the conference completing the old school threepoint play he averages 16 points per game that is 10th in the ACC and best on this Miami roster Music crowd being treated this has been a very entertaining game so far Wake Forest clashing the glass on the offensive end unable to get that one and his guard tried to tip it in a foul is going to be full 11 Second Chance points for Wake but they wont have an opportunity this time Applause Music except the foul first on car thats the thing that that shot and if youre gonna settle with something with Appleby you want him to take jumpers and uh hes been forced to do that the last couple of possessions Applause 2016 was the only time under coach laronega this team was undefeated at home in ACC play and how about long crafty you know what I mean the back courts in this conference are really special in this you know with pack and Isaiah Wong you look at the NC State um Smith and darkell Joyner this backcourt with Appleby and Hildreth put Williamson in there Music along the Baseline in a traveling violation Applause Music Applause is that that last the prior play that threepoint play gets into the Rhythm and thats just the beautiful Up and Under move on March why jump at that you know hes not going to be able to shoot over you just keep your feet keep your hand up long launching fouled on the threepoint shot a Wong Music Applause uh tamari Monsanto picking up fouls against long and look at that just again come pounds and Wong scoring on a midrange jump shot then going out chance for the fourpoint playable you see Anthony Walker a little pose down all right little pose down Ill see you number two foreign play so Wong still into double digits with that threepointer as Monsanto misses it the other end Wong has scored double digits Mike 67 of 80 career games Applause they got a smaller cover on him so hes feeling it from downtown keep an eye on him Tom Monsanto playing with two fouls out there for the tomahawk jam and a Timeout on the court the last 13 points by Isaiah Wong for Miami but here is Isaiah Wong you really got the range on the threepoint shot and then get it out and finishing at The Rim as well all right Applause presented by your local Toyota dealers and what they have done so far today Monsanto connecting on a couple of threepointers and the Toyota starting lineup for the Miami Hurricanes presented by your local Toyota dealers or Chad omear had the first nine points of the game for Miami Isaiah Wong coming on strong with 15 points he has scored 13 in a row to Miami right and he started it out one of four and then he got that jump shot down the other end got fouled mens perfect five of five since then its 13 points coming over the last minute 52 seconds for Isaiah Wong gildrift thatll fall soft bounce inside Watsonville Center and he had popcorn guarding him so not a you know not a giveaway mismatch inside but hell be shown his strengths this is Wong Pilgrims on his hip contact against Carr Amir caught a shot till he comes back up leaving his way aggressively to the rim and you know what and omir was tending to his mouth and hes still doing that and he never got turned around and Hildreth just ran right up his back Applause points for hildred three of six shooting for number two in Black Applause Music Applause Music around the OMeara screen and Appleby is getting hung up engine omir sets a three pack has gotten some good looks despite that Miss how about the shooting in this game Mike its Wake Forest 52 perceptional to the floor Miami 72 field goal shooting theyve taken 11 fuers only made two fewer Clinton threepointer from the corner timeout Miami 70 run for Wake Forest trying to come back flurry from Miami led by Isaiah along with 13 straight points Ma so far three of four on threepoint attempts Wake Forest has made six threepointers heres a look at our Coyote Tractor Turning Point involves Isaiah long wow great scorers find a way to get their numbers we talked about the slow start with him 104 but it doesnt take much to get that pilot light lift because Isaiah hes using the screen effectively but hes shooting threes Tom I mean hes really really tough to guard I mean his his 4K is that getting to the rim getting out of the open floor but when he can spread it through the three almost unguardable a couple of Threes made for Wong hes got 46 mean threepointers on the season playing it is 122nd game Miami uniform the junior Piscataway New Jersey almost on his average for the season 15 points for one he averages 16 Ryan this is again George Miller we havent said his name much at all in this game and he wants to get into the action great finish that was against the double team and a tall double team as well with Clinton and Carr first points of the game from Miller Clinton picked up the foul Jordan Miller Senior Middleburg Virginia Music 24 points 11 boards for him in that game second double double of the season for Jordan Miller in the win against the heels on Monday its 914 from the floor and played 39 minutes Music Applause Music all the way across the Williamson catch it shoots threepointer from the corner and weve rediscovered that shooting touch Applause nine points all on threes for Williamson Music Applause and catches three points last Saturday in a home win against Georgia Tech and was one of three from threepoint systems and see this is the thing with Clinton that he gives you is some quickness out there along with that with the length that he provides in the threepoint shooting time will mirror up for the rebound Music is packed behind the line Nigels back well Appleby got caught going under the screen that time pack reading it just rising up both guards seeing a big basket from behind the arc nine points for pack with his first three of the game the fourth mean threepointer for Miami Williamson again online just a bit strong long rebound long knifing his way to the rim car recovered for the block children takes it to the bucket and earns free throws Applause far is down behind the play Ron this is Forbes lets see Forbes has loved his defense all season long thats why hes been in the starting lineup and saves two points there with Wong going out and just kind of shaking it off Music I think you know I dont know how much well see Marsh in this game maybe Spot Beauty going forward Tom but the I like the unit out there with Wake Forest with Clinton and Mar and Carr Mike lets get a message from Coyote Tractor from my experience if you work the land youve got to be a jack of all trades you got to have a little bit of options and a whole lot of getgo its now from Cameron gilgrim has a 75 free throw shooter averaging just under 13 points per game with Wake Forest Music were almost at what Virginia Notre Dame scored for the game so I have another 20 minutes to go endtoend action between Miami and Wake Forest exactly what you might see from these dual mere set of screens long back to pack several feet behind the line and Keynes will go to the locker room with the 4744 advantage against visiting week well twice wake has come back they had a very sluggish start from the tip and then Wong put them in a hole on threepoint try shot 67 in the first half they are the best shooting team in the ACC you know I think for Miami too I mean if youre going to play the screen role and youre really going to commit to Appleby you know then get the ball make it tough on him get the ball of his hands if they score on that pick and roll inside this team Miami is explosive enough offensively to live with that being shot 52 percent of the first half but miss from Clinton to open up the second half threepoint game we crank up the second 20 minutes from Toro Gables watsko Center Tom wormy Mike jiminsky in our outstanding ACC basketball production yeah and this is uh this is the lineup that Steve Schwartz went to that was most effective for them in the second half of that first half Music its on the Run Monsanto the Miss here after a quick start mens Montanas pulled off picked up the foul the other end Mike thats his third and hes going to get a technical well and you know hes saying hes he took a wristband off and he threw it over to the bench but it was the way that he threw it I mean I know what hes arguing right here but you cant do that after the foul has been called on you and thats going to be four on him now watch this right here he cant believe he takes his headband off and hes going to launch it right there and that you know that you cant do that so long is it the line for Miami for shooting technical free throws and as Mike mentioned thats now four personals on Monsanto with the technical foul well you know and like in this that transaction with Williamson in the ball game right now not bad I mean hes hes scoring for you at least youre right Mike Monsanto is two of nine threepoint tries and hes headed to the Steve Forbes bench as long as at the free throw line he was fouled by Monsanto in the shot attempt foreign Monsanto despondent on that with horse bench company throws from long yeah I mean you know everything working again so I mean the foul was called against him he was visually upset before then and then he was way he was out in the open when he threw the headband across the port its just a referee is not going to stand for that B is there at all for the shot trajectory yeah and also pack a nice job but defensively oneonone there life has been difficult for Applebees so far in this game long able to get away from Hildreth create space and hit the jumper and where its been difficult for half of me it has been almost effortless for Isaiah Wong hes been special how about 21 points Mike seven of 13 shootings gone for 20 points or more for the ninth time this season take it back by Miami sixth turnover by Appleby back score it threepoint bucket timeouts deformed Music Miamis on an 80 run Timeout on the court Music 5644 Isaiah along leads everybody Mike with 21 points and they think you know in todays game the midrange game is almost disappear but that is such a strike it is its got great size the step back to create and he just goes to number seven passes number 33 there on the alltime scoring at least Jackson Clinton hes been a great player he was here and maybe uh heavy number two headed to the rafters for Miami who knows 1704 points right now go long and Counting Wong has 19 of Miamis last 29 Points he had two of the first 29 Points for the Kings Miller a little hesitation and fake hes a guy in conference whos the leading scorer on this team but hes so unselfish he does whatever this team needs and hes like the third or fourth option scoring wise today but very very effective and Miller averages 15 points per game just Applause Williamson again lets see if Wake has another run to get back into this ball game and uh Williamson has really been solid for them all afternoon hes got four main threepointers Mike on seven chances and 12 points so David Williamson again he struggled against Georgia Tech last Saturday to his one main threepointer Miller fights for the loose ball and rebound omir he grabbed it then traveled yeah he just got his feet Tangled Up and thats you know when you go down like that its an automatic call Applause so Appleby will walk it up the court for Wake Forest Applause trailing by 11 deleted halftime was three for Miami this is Applebees he launches a threepointer when I was watching that they ran him off three screens wheeled around and the pack was just running for his life trying to keep up maybe thats the shot that gets uh Appleby in rhythm first three of the game for Applebees got 51 made on the season watch out for one and thats a you know pokers thats a great matchup I think for a wake but long is just making some really good shots Music just a little smile there from Isaiah Wong coach larenanga tells us he doesnt say a lot s his play do the talking hes done that so far today the loudest Kane in the Box Score Isaiah Wong the car was wide open Mike from Appleby well and thats it looked like you know Amir is looking over at the bench and that was the pick and roll he stayed with Appleby nobody came behind to get car Applause Music Applause Music Applause Poplar flying out of that corner back to pack Applause Music finish Applause looks like the fifth option as theyre offensively for this team but you work so hard on everybody else he gets a wide open follow Hildreth got a mirror in the air and lays it in what a fake by hildred yeah hes one of the most improved players in the conference this year hes been so good Applause jump from last year last season Mikey only averaged four points per game thats Nigel pack hitting the jumper the thing I mean Appleby is having to work extremely hard on the defensive end of the floor 14 points for pack one of three Miami Hurricanes in double digits and scoring in this game foul against wink his car tried to set a screen Applause the lead is 10 for Nigel pack and the canes Applause Music star to watch is Nigel pack hes been impressive Mike over his last several games yeah we talked about it uh 22 and a half points over his last two uh feeling more comfortable is 15 to 25 shootings over 50 percent from three five times this year Tom plus 20 points in the game so that is a very explosive backboard 23 points in the win Monday at North Carolina for pack thats right and Isaiah Wong had an off game in Chapel Hill and Miami still comes away with the win Jordan Miller was terrific Wong had just 10 points against the Tar Heels Miller had a doubledouble with 24 points and 11 boards Music Applause Music smear out of the game Music and Anthony Walker has put in some nice minutes not not extensive in this game but hes been productive on the floor Applause Williamson Applause spoke to Applebee by Clinton and then Applebee hits the target from threepoint real estate yeah one of those plays thats not going to show up in the stat sheet but Clinton made that whole thing keeping the ball alive and knackled and Applebees starting to heat up a little bit Tom second three of the game for Appleby hes into double digits Mike along with gildren and Williamson leads wake with 12 over Hildreth Michael live with that letting him create off the roof he plays off of other people better than creating his own shot demon Geeks hanging around after trailing by as many as 14 here in the second half took the head by back to the rim and he transit for the Kings just again scoring off of every single Wake Forest mistake it was the ninth turnover by Wake Forest 21 points off turnovers for Miami Appleby here we go if Wade can just take care of the basketball they got a chance to get back and really get in this game its 11 made threes by the demon beaks Applause they are second on the conference nine main threes per game Carr wants one over top of backboard and to Miami heres the look and uh theres just that when you turn the ball over out there I mean its an automatic two points foreign Applause shooting just uh gonna get a minimal rest here underneath probably underneath the 12 timeout packs on the bench two of five from threepoint distance close to 50 percent from Beyond The Arc over his last 14 games theyve got to be careful too with how they react to foul calls in this game theres already been one technical on Monsanto and Applebee John a little bit of Bill Covington who actually called that first technical whats that first whistle happens time you gotta She Gotta button things up a little bit and monsantos had to stay on the bench with four personals including the technical foul and a couple of made threes and this one is going against Miami Omer illegal scream you you have to let you have to let the guy thats what happened on the handoff just handed off but when you hand it off and open up like that which a lot of people teach I mean thats the play that sometimes doesnt get called Applause Music they turn it over this time Beverly into the defender and a foul Clinton was back defensively for Wake Forest third foul against Clinton so Beverly to the line when we come back its an eightpoint game dear viewers we may lead to eight was as large as 14 in this second half 5844 for Miami lets take a look at the Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina upcoming schedule for Wake Forest Mountain not an easy road for the deacons three of them are counting this game three of their last five on the road and including that the NC State is playing as well as everybody in conference right now and then Steve Force pointed out to us at the last game against wake against Syracuse team they have not played yet this year until the last game in that zone up in the dome you know how tough that is Duke is going to find out today although Duke has won nine of the last 10 against Syracuse Mike overall in that series all right time for our Fresh Market discover the best feature that is Tyree Appleby and we talked about it at the open about trying to become the first player in ACC history to lead the league in scoring and assists but we looked and I thought I had the answer its only been done one time before on any level wow and that was Nate Archibald in the NBA for the Kansas City Kings 34 points 11 assists for him saw him at the end of his career yeah start with the Boston Celtics thats when the Celtics took a lot of guys and Paul Silas at the end of his career helped them win some championships rest in peace Bob Cousy the coach for yup tiny Archibald in his days in Kansas City with the Kings Applause got a beautiful game Mike 6960 hanging in there the number 15 team in the nation coming off a win last Saturday at home against Georgia Tech a couple of nice home wins against North Carolina and Clemson as well for the demon digs who started 100 and home for the second straight season but they give this one back tomorrow well at least it was a dead ball turnover but still I mean it was just a past have been attempted the way it was Music Applause Walker Walker trying to calculate that angle just a smidge too strong Music now theyre giving they got no with a little bit of a break Walker getting some extended minutes with his size out on the floor Applause Builders just really solid thats just scoring today but also making plays I have assists hes pretty tied with Applebee for team lead Applause childrens now with 12 points Appleby leads the way with 13 for Wake Forest 23 for wall Beverly missed fires omir over the top couldnt get it here comes Appleton Applause about the defensive work by Beverly and also Walker helped out with a double and they throw it away Steve Forbes was wide open and made the catch on the sideline Music not the guy you want to send it to though with your Tyree Appleby you know right right now I mean Wade needs to simplify things theyre trying to make spectacular killer passes out there you got to make an easy pass to an open teammate 62 is a team from the floor Miami its wrong Applause shoveled it over to Miller the Miss from threepoint distance Clinton trying to run it down he collided with Wong they both end up in photographers row and theyre going to call long I think that foul Ted Valentine coming behind the play Applause heres the look it was a foot race in Clinton we talked about athletically and uh were gonna call Long on that I dont think theres any shot involved was so that is the first foul against Wong now certainly Mike we have the benefit of Replay but it appeared to be two players just trying to jump down that ball Ted Valentine was much closer to the play than we are supposed to Rover as the scorers table Applause Brent Hampton are over there in general in this game though Miami has not fouled this only their second team foul Applause Wake Forest basketball Appleby to trigger the inbounds and Poplar will come in hell replace Harlan Beverly Poplar has four points Beverly leaves with three points on one of two shooting Applause opportunity here for Wake with Wong out of the ball game Poplar the sophomore from Philadelphia Pennsylvania nine points in the win against Carolina on Monday Applause car off the inbounds play Crystal Meer and over top of him for two and all Amir did I mean hes not a shot blocker inside he just had his hands that was pretty good Patience by car four points per Carr for Wake Forest Applause play on the inside in Miami for bucket Miller has it thats the thing you know you got Wong out of the game you think you can exhale and then Jordan Miller steps up and starts scoring eight points now for Miller Applause Hildreth on the drive Miami collapsed defensively and there was a foul called Poplar just picked up his third personal so Hildreth is at the freethrow line Mike for two so far in the game for hildred from the strike and this is a good way for Wade to claw back in this game too if they slow things down attack the rim get to the freethrow line stop the clock Applause sophomore from Worthing England Applause Music response well you want to stay tuned for the fast break presented by your local Ford dealer thats coming up in just moments well take a look at some of the statistical category leaders in and around the ACC Applause Hildreth this season Mike had a triple double the third in school history alondis Williams had one last year the player before that to get a tripledouble was Tim Duncan you might have heard him yeah I said guys remember his name 14 Points 11 rebounds 10 assists Mr Hildreth that tripledouble came against Hampton that rattles out on a three attempt from back theyve been testing him theyre still looking for one underneath on that screen packed that one in and out five of 12 threepoint shooting Miami quick passing its Marsh with a dunk Music bangers and mash and its March yeah and uh great extra pass inside Miller attacking the defense got it back after the Miss omear off his fingertips into Marsh taken back by Poplar and no help great defensive play Ed it up and knocked it down why what a turnaround for Miami Poplar makes that just just like a cornerback turns around makes the play no white jerseys around and pack steps into a three points for Nigel pack threemade threes in a congested area its Marsh and he lays it in and will stride to the line all right foreign Music Applause ER just so heads up patience and then everybodys shattered he walks right into it in rhythm three of seven on threepointers for pack and 19 points Marsh who is at the free throw line not surprisingly Mike five of five from the floor at least two or three dunks for March the main free throw thats where he struggles not this time though Applause Music keeping that intact doubledigit score with 12 pops or misses by the way wake is not as the free throw theyre eight of eight Music so this is an interesting matchup with Poplar against Appleby Applause closing in on seven and a half minutes to go in regulation theyre going to live with Marsh getting some dunks inside theyre gonna really lock down on Applebees wow Poplar lost it on the way up Miller was in there too foul coming up against Wake Forest so well take a moment this is a threepoint game just like it was at halftime 7471 Music this is the fast break presented by your local Ford dealer lets get a look at some of the leaders in the ACC this season and it includes Tyree Appleby Mike playing in our game this afternoon amazing time in the history of the league nobody has ever LED it in scoring and assist Appleby trying to do that this year because Steve Forbes have gotten another player of the year in the portal what a game Appleby had against North Carolina 23 of 28 from the freethrow line both of those ACC records and Casey Marcel uh leading three and threepoint percentage uh former Virginia player and the pack really rolling this year all right we go to Armando baycat no surprise hes the leader in rebounding Judah mints for the kiss and Jesse Edwards also amongst our leaders yeah how about on the defensive side out of that zone leading the conference and stealing and Edwards anchoring that back with the almost three blocks a game Syracuse had a win against NC State on Tuesday thatll be the opponent for NC State coming up tomorrow against North Carolina here are the three ranked teams of the ACC yeah as we begin play today uh Virginia right there theyve been all year long Miami as well theyve been theyve been right there but how about NC State getting into the top 25 Miami undefeated at home this year as well trying to keep it that way today against Wake Forest and we thank you for watching the fast break presented by your local Ford dealer in the ACC home to some of the most exciting teams in the country all season long and Valley Sports is home to the action Applause the threes yourself for the dunks and be there for the rivalries Applause Music the basketball all season long on Valley Sports and the Valley sports app Music Keynes needed 7471 7 24 to go in our second half Music there is our zMAX Max performance features Jordan Miller in the fivegame winning streak for Miami Mike they won five in a row six in their last seven the number 11 a big reason why excuse me man thats the thing about him though its impressive is he doesnt really Force his way into the offense he doesnt hunt his shot he lets things come to him hes so efficient when that happens and those are those are really solid numbers that was our zMAX Max performance Jordan Miller I mean you look at the numbers for Wake Tom I mean when theyre taking care of the ball for the game theyre shooting 54 383 theyre perfect from the freethrow line Miami is eight of eleven as a team from the line of the game its 82 from the stripe on the season and this is and thats also with their one of their big three threats in Monsanto over on the on the bench with four personal fouls thats the guys made 82 threepointers on the season to leave the ACC Applause good free throw shooting team Steve Forbes knows it 78 percent as a team for Jim lareneggers Miami Hurricanes here we go Mike seven minutes and change fivepoint game tough ass to Williamson thats into the backcourt race for the basketball Appleby did well to hustle back that is a backboard violation it is and its that was a really important play for Appleby to chase that down he takes the turnover get a chance to save your defense and thats the second time weve seen him he made a play earlier in the first half where he ran down and made a steal this one he saves two points right there 14 turnovers in the game for Wake Forest after that one went into the backcourt poppers on the inbound Music got it back three From Poplar Applause well if youre gonna pick the four guys to shoot a three hes the one youre gonna try to test and he just makes you pay Poplar passing the test theres a 37 threepoint shooter body of work this season popper making the 73 of the game for Miami the shot clocks at five reflected this is Juan leading the break Hildreth recovered to stop pack from shooting thats a wild pass inside Marsh intercepts that was actually a good active Hands by hildred defensively but Applebees closing in on double figure turnovers in this game Applause Applebee in car in tight quarters car advancing to the rim omir defending Applause wrong lost the handle children and Appleby then lost it and then committed a foul Music so while we have a second heres our CPI Security protecting the paint youre being aggressive inside with Paco Mike yeah getting on the offensive glass I mean thats you know we just saw him knocked out knock knock scoring in a variety of fans again guy who just you know they dont run a ton of plays for him Music seven points well go Poplar three of six from the floor his teammate Nigel pack is about to step to the free throw line you know it really is amazing that Wake Forest is still within eight points in this game before these two free throws with all the turnovers theyve had that have led the easy points Appleby just picked up his second personal to put packet to freethrow line for the oneonone by the way Mike Applebees number one and black has 11 turnovers thats a career high thats what you dont want yeah thats uh we used to wed call that the double not the triple double and zeroing in on it and amazingly with pack at the free throw line Mike Appleby has not gone to the free throw line and weve mentioned on a couple of occasions against North Carolina in the win for Wake Forest he went 28 times as an ACC record here he goes driving to the rim look up below tie Applebee and thats the guy whos not six feet tall but no you get him a running start getting to that right hand that was a loud two points Music Applause back in traffic had to hand it off along Music Applause Jinx refusing to relent Applause pack trying to take it off its hinges for the jam Lord Shadow Mirror with 15 points alleyoop in that car above everyone Applause they have to be hobbling a little bit but a really nice find that time weak side defense falling asleep on car six points per car hesitation won over Marsh Santos come back into the game playing with the four personal foul two of nine on threepointers that is his specialty lines this one up in Monsanto hits it for threepoint atmosphere yeah hes figuring hey you know I dont know what Im gonna do here but Im gonna give myself a chance from behind the arc Applause time out Miami after the Monsanto three how about the move by Applebee charging to the rim and slamming it home for a Wake Forest Tire recap of a very entertaining game Tyree Appleby threepoint shooting for weight yeah hes been a lot more aggressive in the second half and kind of saw that coming two and four in the first half but very explosive to the rim knocking down threes but I I dont know that Ive ever seen double figures I dont know if Ive ever seen double figures in turnovers in a game Appleby with 11 right there on the IHOP game summary Mike and weve got five players right now for Wake Forest and double digits and Isaiah Wong moving into seventh all time and scoring and Clinton uh has eight points so two points away from a double double in their sixth double figure score Applause four minutes and change remaining fivepoint game hes had the lead here in the second half after leading by three at halftime now jump back thats how you do it that was a bio oh by the way there wasnt a lot of ball movement wasnt a lot of player movement he had some room rise up four and threepointers for Nigel pack hes also now the leading scorer for Miami with 24 sixth time this season hes gone for 20 or more up at the ribbons over here pack leads the way drops it off Miller Marsh came back to deflect it score of the basket Jordan Miller Applause Music Applause thank you uh just very impressive to me this afternoon how fast Miami has been in transition four players from Miami in double digits five players for a wake doubledigit scoring including Appleby with 15 on six of nine shooting in three threes Miamis got a couple guys in the 20s thatd be Wong and pack heres Appleby aiming for the 20s hit the front rim Bart couldnt grab it he hit the deck long runs into Appleby fouled before the play yeah thatll be the third on Tyree Appleby Miami is on the bonus Music Applause Music so long to the free throw line oneonone Music one of the best from the line in the league Mike 84 and eighth in the ACC for Isaiah Wong if they win hell hear about missing the free throw for the Four Points yeah Applause he was part of a 130 run off by himself against Steve Forbes team in the first half lead has been as big as 14 Music from Isaiah Wong Applause a nice job by Pat getting up hes making Applebee kick the ball for more he wanted to walk that one into the first front court before the clock started Applause now exactly three minutes to go Monsanto Poplar did everything you could defensively that time but Monsanto is swinging around to their right hand its a little bit easier shot but that was sure its almost like weve seen him a few times this year Mike he prefers the difficulty of a threepointer I have been popular games like I said he was chasing him right that whole play four main threes for Monsanto 84 for the season ACC and long turns it over solid job by hildred its larnega I can understand his dismayed tamari Monsanto just hit that last three and Appleby will roll it up to Mid Court what a basketball game 9081 with two and a half minutes to go you know I have witnessed some scoring in this building my friend Carr hes got a three Music Ill tell you what you just cant Wake Forest a lot of credit there were some times in this game they could have gone away we saw 212 points combined by Cornell in Miami and a twopoint win for the Kings Music long will hit it Music just keeping waking arms length link this one Miami looking for a third straight win in the series after going on the road in WinstonSalem and winning last year four on one Miami popular layup Applause actually that no call benefited Miami fire was four on one toward the end hell just stop and start over Miller too strong omir has the rebound Applause eight boards now for omir that leads Miami final minute Applause tough shot from pack his bar had the Box up how about Miami with 34 points off wake turnovers in this game car steps into a three and hits it Forbes wants an immediate timeout his last one Applause theyre going down swinging if they come up short this afternoon his car just hit a three yeah thats back to back threes for him as well what massive points coming up that was wakes last time out car can hit the three mikeys made two in this game just backtoback trips and hes got 30 for the season yeah 33 on the year which is credible I mean you know you got to pay attention but I just want to give you the shooting percentages Mike with 41 seconds left we just saw the Miami huddle 58 Wake Forest 56 percent teams have put on an absolute scoring show 9487 with 41 seconds left and fans of all ages can appreciate the offense of the ACC well and its uh its you know the the free throw line has also been a big stat for Miami without scoring awake by six there 1417 but that you know you look at those shooting numbers that you just talked about with wakey take care of the basketball team is you know this teams north of 100 points right now 18 turnovers in the game for Wake Forest Appleby 12 turnovers by himself and unfortunately for him that is a wake School record yeah I dont know that Ive ever witnessed the game that Appleby with his next assist could have double figure assist and double figure turnovers the assists are no surprise he leads up in that category score as well in the ACC Appleby with 15 points in this game that is a little bit shy of his 186 for the year on average if youre gonna Omer is the guy you want to foul in this situation of the guys out on the floor and theyre trying to funnel the ball to him and the fouling wall Clinton was in the neighborhood yeah they tried but nobody was guarding omira that time they were just they were trying to get the ball in his hands and that being said hes 71 percent and thats the lowest of the Five Guys out on the floor so the oneonone situation for Miami and Wong last one after this next foul would be double bonus seven of eight from the line Mike for Wong in the game 27 points 30 seconds remaining Monsanto got the shot away was looking for contact in a crawl and it didnt happen and theyre gonna see four because theres uh put the halt sign up and Miami remaining undefeated at home and this crowd I really give you credit this this crowd was really warm to this team and they should in this building and larenaga said the support of his fans has been enormous at home and it happened again today Miami shoots 59 percent of the game and wins it 9687 for Coach baronaga win number 248 which is the head coach of the Kings like I said you know if youre if youre offensively youre looking at this really you know a terrific shooting performance but just so careless with the basketball on the road
