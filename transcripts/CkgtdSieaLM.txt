Music thank you Music you could not ask for a better tone Setter castle guard racking here in Blacksburg Randolph Childress Jay alter with you North Carolina starts with the basketball and guess whos missing in the Tar Heels starting five the ACC Zoo preseason ACC player of Dia Armando baycott Hubert Davis told us hes got some soreness but said hes not injured and yet we dont see him on the court yeah I wonder if watching them in the warmups he didnt use his right arm as much I know he injured his shoulder a little bit in the Indiana game and I wanted to just hold him up for precautional if theres something more seriously hes not playing tonight ripped away Caleb love the steal everything but the finish and a foul called so there is Armando Bay cop the ACC preseason player of the year he went through a full warmup we saw him run out with the team hes dressed just not in that starting five but when youre watching hes kind of for and take it from a guy whos had three shoulder surgeries hes kind of baby in that right that right shoulder a little bit so he hadnt taken his warmups off so well see for a Tar Heels team that comes in the number one team of the nation everybody thinks Huber Davis is teams just gonna pick up where they left off in March and April now on a threegame losing streak now no Armando Bay caught at least to start this game how does Huber Davis find a way to win in a really tough environment well hes gonna have to rely on his defense that shouldnt change and puff Johnsons you know its starting to start lineup tonight Carolina has to be better defensively and if they want to compete and stay in this game tonight theyre going to have to do so on the defensive end heres Sean Padula the leading scorer for the Hokies right now working against leaky black black all over him hes got eight inches on Padula Linda used it there Padula can post up most point guards and most Wings in his league but I dont know about leaky blocking his size with that seven foot wingspan thats a tough matchup in the post for Padula black going right at Padula keeps it alive RJ Davis count it plus the foul the weather you got it like if youre a tarheel fan earlier theyre not selling for jump shots theyre talking to paint all three shot attempts right now have been at The Rim thats a really tough take it from RJ Davis quick early foul on basilia got to monitor that as well it may not be as important without vacant out there cant complete the threepoint play you know both Caleb love and RJ Davis have struggled to find their shooting form early in this season maybe North Carolina wants to go into the paint even without baycott one adjustment you notice early North Carolinas putting their best perimeter Defender hello Couture right to the rack the new one you cant even hear the whistle thats how loud it is at Castle Coliseum I mean guitar just turns the corner and just punches it on love I know love wasnt expecting that and he and Couture was challenging himself early hes shooting the ball really well from three hes actually shooting from three better than he is from two so he wanted to get easy field goals getting the pain to finish him nothing stronger than that finish there Applause Davis slips in Pete Nance off the window and in Pete Nas is the guy that can hes not going to feel the shoes of Armando but he can ease the absence of him and he does so much for this team Keturah three its good five for the Hokies yeah great penetration by Padula finds him you got to get there and close out to him you dont give a 42 threepoint shoot an open look slotted Away by mutts Brazilian the post misfires the game is played at the pace right now that Carolina wants to play its up and down Carolina loves it travel here Shuffle the Timothy theres Mike young head coach of the Hokies dont get much better to him hes as good as there is in college basketball Music so Virginia Tech off to a terrific start to the season 71 but Mike young said we could still be better offensively need more flow as Padula lays it up and in thats what hes hoping for today against North Carolina well he thought his team had spells in the Minnesota game and in the cost of Charlottes where they were taking quick shots theyre theyll run on transitional missed shots and turnovers but theyre better when they execute their offense at PACE offensive foul going the other way Darius Maddox laying his body on the line great step in great split offensively but two guys coming over Maddox hes much to the spots to take the charge RJ RJ Davis got to kick that out he has Shooters on a weak side sometimes when youre missing a big piece like Armando you tend to want to step up and make up for that absence and just relax the game will come to those guys the offensive foul for a moving screen on Grandpa zilli been a very physical game I mean early in the season but this is ACC play first conference game for both teams and you can sense the atmosphere and the way both teams have come out physically theyre ready for it Carl everybodys talking about Carolina but again this team is going to come out theyre going to compete the Virginia Tech is looking for a game like this you know theyve competed against this team They Know Each Other Well they know what theyre up against theres no backdown in either one of these teams youre going to expect a physical game all night no matter whos on the floor the clock resets to 1613 five seconds added on Hubert Davis getting the explanation Applause I think hes still talking about that charge he thinks Maddox slid up under RJ Davis he had already left the ground Applause and theres another offensive foul backtoback possessions for Virginia techster on a charge thats four turnovers for North Carolina early I think thats the this is the Achilles heel of North Carolina team right now forson drive over penetrating he got open guys he had that passed One Step earlier and again the fourth turnover which is hurt Carolina got three losses theyve just been outscored because of the points that theyve given up on turnovers uh teams playing without their preseason ACC Player of the Year Armando baycott not at the starting lineup were unsure if well see him he is dressed did go through warmups but Huber Davis said still dealing with some soreness Applause Seth Trimble checks in thats Kate up love picks up a quick two and now the Freshman comes in Applause lets go put a lot of pressure offensively on RJ Davis and Pete Nash needs to get himself involved as well dont be surprised they run and get him some looks on the Block leaky black pull up pop cant knock it down Applause right now Carolinas trying to struggle to find out their identity with two of their main pieces on the bench right now Armando hadnt checked in him with his injury in RJ and Caleb love with two quick fouls this is the guy thats got to get it going for himself and everyone else stolen away bazilly in attack mode puts it up and in five turnovers early here for Carolina again its something that they have to get under control theyre going to get anywhere close to the team that they were at the end of the year a year ago Virginia Tech on a seven nothing run cashing in on those five turnovers puff Johnson fires a three nothing but air just great defense by the Hokies theyre pressuring them denying passes denying the ball forcing the guys if they want to take shots taking those shots Brazilian muscling his way to the rim hes at the foul line when we come back and orange out in Blacksburg in the castle guard as Virginia Tech up by four early now the last two of the times the last time these two teams saw each other the ACC tournament semifinal in Brooklyn the Hokies pulling a huge upset 7259 part of a magical four wins in four days to claim that ACC Championship Randolph and we were just reminiscing about this yeah they took a shot at the buzzer to be 10 seeded Clemson in that tournament they could have that rims out theyre done instead an ACC Championship for the first time in program history I had to go after that Clemson win had to play Three Tournament teams to get there I mean no doubt about it they were playing the best basketball in the ACC at that point I mean we know Carolina went on and made it to the national championship game but Virginia Tech was playing great basketball yeah whats funny North Carolina they found something during that tournament as well right yeah to go on that run Darius Maddox had 20 in that semifinal right now the Hokies doubling up North Carolina 105 we have yet to see Armando baycott we were asked Huber Davis when we chatted with him before the game point blank you know whats his status and he said nothings injured yeah theres some soreness so we expected to see him fully so this is a bit of a surprise to see him on the bench I I the way hes looking now and the way hes moving I I dont know if hell play tonight it just looks as though hes not going to play Applause puff Johnson who got the start its set at baycott misses there so how does this team win without him I think the most difficult thing about him not playing he had an attempt to practice they hadnt had time to practice in general because of his schedule and then now youre missing him he played in the last game and you just hadnt had time to practice without him so theyre going to figure this out on the Fly and Huber Davis also shared with us that DeMarco Don the sophomore guard broke his hand during practice yesterday so the Tar Heels are kind of trying to put it together on the Fly theyre trying to figure this out and this guy here on the post has to play yeah Im expecting them to try to run their offense some through Pete Nance hes the one guy thats capable of cushioning the blow of Armando Bay cop being out on both ends of the floor a fiveminute scoring draft for North Carolina Padula that rims in for Sean Padula youre looking at Pete Nance just got the last bucket for North Carolina transfer from Northwestern hes trying to fill that stretch four roll that Brady manic perfected for North Carolina last spring yeah I think everyones expected him to play to fulfill the shooting role that Brady manic did and hes just not that type of shooter hes capable shooter hes still a 40 threepoint shooting but he just you know Brady Manning made 98 threes second in North Carolina history a year ago you just dont replace that with anyone but I do think he can help them better on the defensive end they just hadnt shown it so far this season dontrez Styles and Tyler Nichol on the floor for the Tar Heels this is a North Carolina five with Trimble out there as well they might be playing in game action for the first time together all season long Davis cant connect from Deep well theyre going to get minutes tonight we got two guys two heavy minute guys that have been out Maddox drills it Darius Maddox and Virginia Tech extends their lead to seven its a great sign of your Virginia Tech hokey fan 3x Maddox has made shots this year but he struggled from three a guy that shot 50 from the threepoint line a year ago its only shooting 26 so far this year thats way off the mark for Dontre styles Music Motts into a double team and he traveled Applause Virginia Tech still in the drivers seat though weve got some pokeys history that happened this week well share it with you when we come back Music Jimmy a man of this first triple double in Virginia Tech womens basketball history 24 points 11 assists 10 rebounds incredible thats amazing and thats amazing when you got to play like the preseason and reigning ACC player on you of the year as a teammate and youre able to do that yeah good to create quite the dynamic duo Hunter Couture Georgia Amore is my role model I love that thats hard to do not many guys get a chance in a game they actually get a triple double right now its all Hokies Virginia Tech on a 122 run over the last six minutes North Carolina just shooting three of nine theyre oh of three from three one thing that Virginias doing is theyre hedging that ball screen really hard and the Carolina guards cant get downhill and getting the paint and create forcing them into a lot of oneonone and a lot of contested shots right now five turnovers only one made Basket in the last seven minutes for North Carolina Lynn Kidd through the spin cycle up and in for two I came up and watched this team in the fall I thought he had had improved as much as anybody on the team like he was a guy you wondered if hed play and hes forced coach young into playing him and made himself a rotational guy credited link kid in his workout Davis floater gets it to fall desperately needed bucket for the Tar Heels its got to continue attacking the paint not only for himself but for his teammates and right now hes without his back court Nate love who has two fouls in in Armando I dont think hes taking off a sweats I dont think hes going to play tonight Maddox off balanced and misses it Applause gotta talk a little bit more in transition like this a couple drag screens get yourself going dont let this defense set through contact nickel count it plus the foul Tyler nickel the Freshman flying in and now an opportunity for a threepoint play Hubert Davis during this threegame losing streak you lose those two out in Portland and then you fly directly to Indiana play a top 10 team on the road they didnt get back to North Carolina until 4 30 in the morning hes barely had time to get these guys in the gym said we had about a practice and a half in the last two weeks right I mean thats you cant fix any issues if youre unable to practice and what youre seeing tonight is Carolina making the same issues that theyve made over the past two weeks and until you get in the gym and have time to practice you cant fix them theyre trying to fix this on the Fly and against this level of competition in the ACC it becomes tough mods the hesitation rolls and doesnt drop but theyre right there I mean this is only a fivepoint game theyve looked a lot better in the last couple of minutes offensively for sure Applause foul on the floor Applause we were just talking about Georgia a Moore in the Virginia Tech hokeys top 10 team after that triple double they just went it beat Tennessee were hearing so you want to see them in action right here on acc Network six eastern time taking on Boston College theyre really really good thats a big win today against Tennessee Volunteers North Carolina in the bonus so shooting the rest of the way for the remainder of his first half Justin McCoy theyre relying on the bench guys guys are coming in theyre going to have to step up I mean you dont make a Deep Run like that without gaining some level of experience this team has seen it all its experienced it all and theyre being challenged right now lets see what theyre made of theyre going to come out theyre competing theyre right here this is a OneShot game right now it feels like with the atmosphere that Virginia Tech is dominant but Carolinas competing Tar Heels on a sixnothing run over the last minute hello brazily regathers going right at leaky black and he missed a great defense from leaky black down low Applause McCoy in attack mode just throws it up didnt get a clean look at it kept in play by Virginia Tech its not the shot you necessarily want if youre Carolina but again at least hes attacking the rim they gotta attack the paint they cant settle for jump shots Couture fires the three and buries it its just a freshman Mistake by Seth Trimble you got to get up got to be up on the catch of Hanukkah tour hes a hes a career 40 threepoint shooter you got to get to him 193rd three now ninth all time for hokeys history threepoint shooting hes a perfect three for three from the floor tonight Davis that rims out no good Applause Music Collins gets the contact and well head to the line the Freshman out of Clover South Carolina stay drive by calling shot fakes gets him off his feet gets the angle gets the bump gets himself a free throw line here Virginia Tech just one of three from the foul line so far this afternoon big decision right here now coach Davis is bringing love back in with two two fouls thats thats gonna be interesting but Davis just picked up his second so he I think he feels he needs to keep one of those guys on the floor yeah the problem is without baycat you really need both of those guys on the floor you do you do but you got to have one oh perfect position for the follow Justin months Music lets go Trimble in trouble and he lost it itll stay with North Carolina Hunter Couture heating up for the Hokies he leads them with eight he checked as he took second three already tonight you got to get up and guard that guy kind of the energy the atmosphere Sky High here at Castle Coliseum the Hokies off to a strong start to the season but Mike young he said hes not happy just with winning he feels like they needed to improve so this week went to the toolbox pulled out the saw said we had to sharpen the saw this week after Mondays win against Minnesota gave the team off on Tuesday and then all Wednesday all Thursday they just focused on themselves no scouting no film on North Carolina just Virginia Tech you need to do that in order to improve so much sometimes she spend so much time worrying about your opponent great drive there by leaky black and you forget to do the things to continue to prove remember its a long journey and no one knows that better than Mike Young well certainly has not been a dull blade for Virginia Tech to start this game a seven point lead an immediate answer Justin mutts feasting inside with no baycot theyre just running their offense and executing with pace theyre Ball moving and body movement is something that Carolina hasnt done as much its another turn over here thats now six turnovers for the Tar Heels in this first half and the one thing about live ball turnovers it doesnt allow you to set your defense and get your Maps up so like right there but Silly Love two fouls the King Garden theyre unable to set their defense and this is what live ball turnovers do to you Karen said you cant anchor down you cant get your match up together and that time they caught Carolina in a matchup and love with two fouls they went right at him and got an easy uncontested layup largest lead afternoon for Virginia Tech up to 11 Applause Nance a three Off the Mark and Virginia Tech 14 of their 26 tonight in the paint thats the name of the game this season everyone thinks theyre just a threepoint shooting team Randolph they like to get into the paint well they do but they shoot it so well and youre so afraid of the ability to shoot that it opens up the plate they control the plank they just controlled it from how well they shoot the three finally a three Falls for North Carolina they missed their first five Caleb love finally connects on a triple Music this Carolina team is going to continue to defend Ula couldnt quite finish a Nifty move Applause the question is Randolph can they string together enough stops to claw back but when their office usually gets staggered this is where they miss Armando just throwing it in the post and playing off of him and the other thing that Armando does is he dominates the glass they dont have an offensive rebound yet this game and Armando averages nearly five offensive rebounds by himself Applause he also gets the foul line quite a lot averages eight and a half free throw attempts a game theyre missing a lot without Armando baycott Armando just dictates their identity their identity about how they play controlling the paint rebounding is him and as time ticks on you wonder if were going to see him at all it certainly doesnt appear that way tonight the bowl games are all set selection Day special with the Huddle crew find out who is playing where 9 pm Eastern Time right here on acc Network nine ACC Bowl eligible teams congrats to Clemson winning the ACC Championship last night is the back door wide open for Hunter Couture just as much does so many things for this team I I think Hunter Couture may be their best offensive player but their most important player is Justin Justin mutts I mean hes a great passer an elite Defender and playing a defensive player of the year candidate for this team and Nance in trouble kick out Caleb love a three cant connect North Carolina in a shooting crowd again this is the other thing Justin much does he can run some point for you get your team in their offense my Bellagio potique says North Carolina to the line Tar Heels shooting one and one good break for Carolina to get to the line get a chance get to the free throw I hope to get an easy bucket you know a guy like Pete Nash needs to see the ball go through the basket theyre struggling right now theyre not getting anything easy theyre trying to figure out what whats going to work without foul trouble Davidson lover back in both of those guys have two obviously I dont know if Armando Badcocks gonna play their rotation is off because of duns broke his hand and heat now hes out he was the first guard Off the Bench so theres a lot of moving parts right now to coach Davis and the staff have to figure out in a team with lets say in a threegame losing streak yeah the confidence is not hot no not at all its hard to be confident and one of the main culprits of that are you turning over to basketball and its showing its head right now in the first half of this game as well its six so far four minutes remaining in his first half Virginia Tech has been in the drivers seat for the majority of this game so far Couture he is red hot a perfect five for five from the floor Hunter Couture hes got 13 not a lot of talking a lot of not a lot of communication on the defensive end for Carolina and thats just target practice love in attack mode thats a great take from Caleb love getting downhill quickly yeah you dont want him getting to the basket going with that right hand with his size speeding athleticism that thats either gonna end up being a foul or bucket like it was monster back screen here dribble handoff s calling for it leaky black commits the foul nine point lead for Virginia Tech theyre looking comfortable against the preseason ACC favorites future coutures led the way nothing gets you going like your first basket and knocking on the head and getting to and one and we all know he can shoot the basketball hes in the zone right now he had to miss the shoddy five for five and leading the Hokies with a quick and easy 13 points right now and hes on fire theyre gonna have to get to him early or if not this game could get ugly quick already above his season average in this first half I think the one thing that makes Couture special hes just been around the program a senior now he ignites this crowd that first bucket that gets Castle kind of see him rocking and every time he rises and Fires for three everybodys up out of their seat not only that I think the most special thing about him is hes an elite Defender and no matter how hes shooting a basketball it doesnt affect his effort on the defensive end hes the consummate threeandd guy and I know he and Justin mutts are alltime favorite to coach Young lofted inside kicked to the corner Couture again his first Miss of the afternoon a great find by a kid just finding them and skipping it across off the front rim from RJ Davis North Carolina shooting one of nine from three Padula he is so crafty it just has not fallen for him today two of seven Couture is picked up for him even though he just finally finally missed one but those two have created a great onetwo punch in the backcourt for Mike Young and both of those guys are really strong Defenders as well but hunter Couture got a foul there but coach doesnt mind trying to deny a dribble handoff getting quick foul coming out getting a break here holding that left shoulder though slumped over as he takes his seat on the bench definitely something to monitor those screens will do that to you trying to run through those screens coaches love it when you do it but trust me from a guy whos had three shoulder surgeries they hurt lets hope hes all right its a big strong guy I think hell be fine Nance one of two from the line rebound bounces out to Virginia Tech Music I dont think Ive ever seen a Carolina team this late and a half and doesnt have an offensive rebound Applause 11 for the game theyre just carving them up I mean theyre shooting at a high clip theyre executing everything that they want theyre running their offense with pace and purpose and on the other end theyre being really disruptive to North Carolina because theyre blitzing their ball screens theyre hedging it really hard guards cant come off and and get an easy look and against one of the foul didnt get it no official rebounds so they cant theyre not getting any extra points on the extra looks medulla tried to thread the needle into Lynn kidding the castle guard wants us to be looked at but its North Carolina basketball the Hokies have gotten themselves into trouble only when they tried to score quick thats a good call off his foot off Lynn Kids Foot yep off Lynn kid trying to get fancy Nance went behind the back didnt need to do it Collins Rises on a wreck attack weve talked about the punch tonight Great British by The Freshman Collins but another live ball turnover but he ends up in the easy basket about Carolina they want to get back into this game they want to fix this they got to take care of the basketball just get a look at the basket the steal and the slam take another look watch ahead folks MJ Collins in your living room last thing you want to see if youre playing against the Hokies is them getting production from their bench this team has had issues from you know scoring from their bench and MJ Collins is coming in tonight and giving this team a spark Applause the biggest issue for North Carolina is they got down early by nine and theyve hovered between that seven and eleven just kind of going back and forth theyve yet to dig out of whats been a comfortable Virginia Tech lead but its hard to figure out what are you gonna do which when Im when youre missing a guy like Armando bake out hes such a big part of your your identity and not just giving him the ball in the post when these guards are getting in the paint the way they do and theyre forcing rotation there isnt a wing or guard in the country that could keep Armando bake out off the glass and youre missing that opportunity right now and hes just such a big part of that and you just cant throw a body in there and get that type of production but when Virginia Tech just execute their half court stuff theyre getting whatever they want Justin Motz right on cue just like that you know there they get in trouble when they try to score quick Applause using his 30 timeout Huber Davis Castle Coliseum rocking in the ACC opener Virginia Tech up 12 Applause Jimmy a man up there Applause the atmosphere really from before tipoff has been fabulous here in Blacksburg Randolph Childress J alter with you cant think of a better way to open ACC play then in the building of the reigning ACC Champions Virginia Tech taking on everybodys consensus number one team in America before the season and now the Tar Heels could possibly lose four in a row down 12 well going back to your point about how difficult it was when I arrived at the game I had to call someone to get in there was so many students outside getting in the building I I didnt think they let me in there were so many people but hey this is just lucky to draw with the schedule I mean what do you say uh sir do you have a ticket yeah Im sorry yeah its sold out hey this is standing room only here just great onball defense about Padula there North Carolinas really struggled seven turnovers only shooting 36 percent Nance makes it a 10point game they just hadnt had an ability to get anything any easy and just a good move there by Pete Nance with the hook use it or lose it timeout for Mike Young well step aside for 30 seconds Hokies one final possession at the end of this first half Virginia Tech has made their last three theyve got a 10point lead lasted 14 seconds left at the end of this first half what do you think Mike young just drew up in the huddle he has many options out there on the floor I mean look at his lineup out there I mean obviously putting the ball in Padulas hands to make a play but right now it may be a ball screen with Priscilla basilio much theres mutts three seconds to work with goes up and it rolls off the rim no good North Carolina a crucial stop but the Tar Heels a season low 27 first half points tonight credit to hokeys defense nothings been easy they forced some early turnovers theyve gotten a couple tar heroes in two fouls got him in foul trouble early credit to Virginia Tech theyre carving them up a cc Player of the Year this awesome atmosphere in Castle Coliseum its been all Virginia Tech if they replicate that performance in the second half theyll win big if they play the way they play in the first half they may run away with this but if youre a Carolina fan again take care of the basketball play with pace they have a chance to get back in they hung around they didnt theyre not going anywhere this is only a 10 point game and they start the second half with Caleb love and RJ Davis on the court together they were both in foul trouble in that first half so that backcourt 10 if we didnt get to see a lot of possessions where they were both on the court its interesting to see the matchups right now theyre putting Nance on Justin mutts Applause to start this second half and thats why I asked about that matchup I think puff Johnson will fear much better defensively against Justin mutts I think basilis just a little big and its ability to stretch the floor thats a jump off just coming out of it time out you see it a pin down for a big bigs arent used to having to defend bigs coming off pin downs and great pin down from a guard on the big and when you got a big suit in the well the silly does I mean stuff to match up big guys just arent used to coming off or know how to defend down ball screens and defending on the perimeter ball on the floor North Carolina recovers eight seconds to shoot heres RJ Davis draws the foul Music Applause and we talked about early in the first half Virginia Tech just shoots the ball so well so it opens the plane up and right now Carolinas just not shooting the ball well from behind the threepoint line and even if best players I mean last year just so far this year Davis and love are shooting a career Works theyre both sup 30 percent from three point rise and I I believe a lot of that is shot selection you know your field goal percentage is indicative of your shot selection that hard heads coming off dribble handoffs and ball screens is really giving up love and Davis in the post wave off the basket of travel before he shot it switch pivot feet and when he reversed back I think hes uh he doesnt like the car but I think he changed pivot feet there the threepoint shooting last season versus this season the only major drop off from that list is Darius Maddox I mean right now when his shot gets to go and look out therell be four guys nearly 40 or better you know and again everybody thinks that theyre just a threepoint shooting team but no theyre a lot more than that they actually get the threepoint Shots by they spreads you out and attacking the pink so they just do it off the dribble they dont throw it in for a postcard and they will pick and choose depending on the matchups and post certain guys scoop to the hoop for Justin watts in Virginia Tech leads by 15 Nance gambled on the steal here got caught in the backside this is direct line and Drive by much Lefty Lane with the reverse put the Hokies up 15 largest lead of the afternoon for Virginia Tech Nance tonight at The Rim but a foul call Grandpa zilli called for a foul I know the fans dont like it but a great look great postup I expect Pete Nash to do this a lot more good strong finish thought that was a good block though looked like he got old balls but they dont take fouls back I hadnt noticed him to do that at all so tough call if youre a hokey fan but again Applause shooting into the castle guard Nance makes both of them Carolinas extending their defense a little bit theyre picking up full court now this is where Justin mutz becomes a point guard for you theyre gonna get it back from Padula there havent been many possessions where North Carolinas been able to set their defense no no well when you turn the basketball over the problem that they have is that they Virginia Tech is just attacking him in so many different ways got Pete Nance with the knee in his back he cant cant stick that knee and extend that forearm in the post defense got to get there Padula leading scorer on the season at 17 a game only has six today assisting for Justin Motz hes getting anything he wants going to the hole thats what makes him so difficult to guard I mean if youre going to give up something to him you got to make him beat you shooting jump shots Dave is trying to answer it falls RJ Davis quiets the crowd thats a tough take thats a tough finish I mean he gets it gets his body into facility so he cant time him and block his shot and kisses it off the glass can North Carolina string together enough stops badul is shooting over everybody misses it Virginia Tech is missing shots I dont think Carolinas making a Miss I think thats the difference between the two teams Davis Cashes in wide open back to back buckets for RJ Davis Applause good sight Steve youre a Carolina fan getting him going I think hes so talented offensively Padula Runner off the window and in like I said I I just think its too easy for them right now theyre getting theyre killing Carolina in the paint theyre just getting easy look easy looks if its not but do list much theyre just taking their time and just soften it up and then they get their threes after that Applause theyre just controlling the paint I mean what do you say and thats something you dont hear often with a Carolina Coach team especially when you got a guy like a Mondo Bakery bucks getting in on the ax from three on cue we just talked about it got three straight layups finish at the paint can start worrying about protecting the rim and now start knocking down threes a 16point lead for Virginia Tech this is the largest deficit of the season for North Carolina and I just said before you want to give Justin must jump shots but again he softens you up he gave him confidence with the layups and then you give him an open three you cant embarrass him into a shot hes only shooting 28 from the year on three but hes shooting the well tonight Applause and heres the problem for Huber Davis in North Carolina you are the runaway favorites in the ACC preseason yeah number one team in the country coming into this year you went to the National Championship a year ago sure youre without Armando baycat today but this is a fan base that is I dont care what the expectations are they never want to lose four games in a row no you dont and they need to get back they need practice time you know I know everyone is impatient this team has gone through it they will they went through it no different than they were a year ago and they actually things turned around they played against this very same hokey team Applause foul called on the Block V week here on ESPN when we come back you are going to hear the powerful story of the wesler family dont want to miss it Im the captain of the peewee football appreciate Colleen and Patrick wessler sharing their story with us happy week here on ESPN Applause we remind you that you can join the fight against cancer by visiting V Dot org slash donate a hundred percent of your donation goes directly to cancer research Randolph Childress Jay alter with you Virginia Tech continuing to control this game on both sides you saw him crash into glass its the last play and in here you really see a big issue that Carolina has in their offense and its going to be much bigger without Armando baycat is theyre just hedging that ball screen so hard Carolinas getting nothing out of it and its just forcing them just to pull the ball out and go oneonone Davis splits the double team shoots comes up empty and offensive rebound but its immediately first collected away first one of the first one in the game which is amazing to hear when youre so used to Carolina being a dominant team it was a staple in their program no Armando baycott its caused huge problems Virginia Tech another offensive rebound theyve now got six foul on the floor Applause man did you think North Carolina would be down by 16 in any point this season well anything is possible when you dont play great but again coming into this game lets be honest I mean I saw it from Armando baycott who was who was unhealthy he didnt play necessarily great in the Indiana game I thought Trace Jackson Davis outplayed him in that performance of that game and I know he got dinged up but the guard play for Carolina just has not been great and they have to fix that and what I mean by that is the backcourt shot selection and everybody to knock down threepoint shots is vital for this team this team needs those guards to score and theyre just not as locked in defensively they need to be it needs to be better ball movement better body movement and better defense speaking with Hubert Davis before the game he says the biggest frustration is they just they havent found time to practice they havent found time to improve you look at that schedule out in Oregon for three games and straight to Indiana yeah you get home at 4 30 in the morning youre not going to practice that day now on the road again here in Blacksburg he said theres just not a lot of time to get on the practice floor to improve and we need to work we need to put in some real work to get this team back on track everything that Carolina has in sights right in front of them the minute that these younger guys are getting right now in the absence of Amando baycod and theyre getting at his point of the Year benefit the team as the season goes on this is just their first ACC game therell be a lot of teams that are going to come in here and struggle during the course of the year theyre just one of many mods continues to dominate up to 15 points for Virginia Tech Carolina just needs to start building habits Music Nance couldnt get a good look s great physical defense by potique Mott stays in attack mode he has taken over this game havent been able to guard him off the bounce hes gotten wherever hes wanted on the floor continues to get to the rim knocked down a three as well and he anchors this hokey defense on this end of the floor love draws the foul he must just coming down and just a little too much too quick off the bounce for Nash high runner coming across the plate hes in his bag hes showing us all his whole entire offensive weapon talk tonight really strong performance by him you look at that Tar Heels band charmando baycott the last couple of possessions hes standing up just trying to encourage this team we saw him warm up hes dressed but has not played today thats got to be frustrating to watch right not nothing you can do oh and a good thing it is lets hope hes just hurt not injured and that this isnt an extended injury that he can just sit out today and then come back next game maybe some rest and and play and again this is a tribal weary team right now heavy legs but they got to start building some habits the identity got to pick up on the defensive end of the floor and jump shots dont fall all the time but defensive effort travels rebounding travels much again three straight makes its a season for Justin Motz they got another answer for him and they got their biggest Defender and Pete Nance on Applause 13 points in this second half he has blown this game wide open for Virginia Tech an 18point Hokies lead Applause and their foot is firmly pressed on the gas they will not let off Music Maddox swatted North Carolina could not keep it in play Justin months a game high 19 points but youre feeling it youre feeling it when youre in the zone youre in the zone what can you say and hes in the zone feed now shes gotten it every way I mean here on the back door cut taking Pete Nance in the post there with his jump hook catching driving with the Lefty lay here I mean shooting a three ball I mean hes done it all tonight I mean hes been as impressive as anyone in the gym and again hes their most important player I think Padulas gotten off to a tremendous start in their best player but I wouldnt argue if you would have say Justin mutz is I mean he does so much for this hokey team and tonight hes not just carrying him defensively hes carrying him offensively two seconds to shoot thats a shot clock violation Applause Justin Motz outscoring North Carolina himself in the second half take a look at points in the paint Virginia Tech 34 Carolina only 14 very unlike a North Carolina team to be out points of the paint by 20 in a game Caleb love trying to breathe some life into the Tar Heels again Carolina just want to chip away Music you know maybe try to say hey lets get this under 10 by the eight minute mark give ourselves a chance to make a run in the end but this is the end of the floor they got to pick it up on right now that just like there no communication on the drive good enough great recovery users athleticism but you want to communicate early get in front of the ball stop it so it doesnt get so deep heres Caleb love just made a three this time attacks does not drop Applause you can live with a shot getting in the paint just knock down three again no shots of fall they got to communicate and pick it up on this end into bazilly double team in trouble finds Padula five seconds left on the shot clock Maddox open for three doesnt knock it down good unexpected double team there by Carolina contact a collision between love and Padula Music block is the call going against Padula you guys need to maybe get on acc Network use the hashtag all the Devotion to give us your Vantage Point and you might just see it on acc Network snap a pick take a video tag it with half Jack all the devotions if theres some some confusion there on whether it was a block for a charge one rep going to block it yeah Teddy Valentine was ready to call the charge they did decide to go with the block and North Carolina once again theyve done a nice job drawing contact to this game in the bonus for the remainder more than 10 minutes left and they can just they got to stick with it and continue they cant get jump shot happy they do a great job of getting him in the bonus and then they started selling for jump shots so you got him in a bonus just keep piling up fouls get to the free throw line again start building good habits so you can turn things around Virginia Tech get a scoring drought of two minutes and 30 seconds Hunter Couture back on the floor floated in brazili beautiful lefthand finish that just executed me I have four sets to a T apasilli against the Freshman Tyler Nichols hes just too big Tyler tried to front but the set lifted the weak side help no one there to help just a great call against that The Freshman Trimble jump shot buries it great job by Trimble its not a great threepoint shooter great getting to a spot good job by Davis just not forcing it you got to charge early in the game by overdripping over penetrating just got to a guy played off to kicked it to the strong side corner just starting theyre starting to play within themselves thats what you want when you talk about playing creating habits great ball movement Collins cant finish but it rolls in Justin mutts again in perfect position and hes got 21 points hes just been dominant today again both ends of the floor Applause now to the Post offensive foul Grandpa zilli got positioning and a frustrating game continues for North Carolina I dont think Pete Nash likes to call I thought he was spinning I didnt I dont know how you get an offensive foul on the spin move maybe he wanted to call it from the earlier bump but he was actually spinning away from him when they actually caught the foul so Applause no Pete Nash not happy with that call its going to attack much and vasili taking over in the second half that time to transfer from Wright State misfires a lot of young guys on the floor two freshmen out there right now for Carolina Music probably had seen as much action and movement without the ball as Florida state is having so I mean its Virginia Tech is having so I think its just an adjustment that they got to make good learning experience for these young guys Davis the floater Falls trying to get North Carolina spark RJ Davis has 12 this set themselves by Carolina getting Ball moving getting the RJ Davis moving coming off and catching curl there nickel could not keep it in play great Hustle by The Freshman Tyler nickel news Tar Heels trailing by 14 7 57 left in this second half coming in with so much hype a lot of expectations preseason number one they joined Duke Kansas and Michigan State for a preseason number one that had suffered a threegame losing streak and you know what now you run the risk of a fourgame losing streak and we talked to Huber Davis he said this team still dealing with the noise of of Praise they got so much noise of disappointment throughout last season then they got praise during the tournament thought theyd just come in and roll Nance rocks the rim but now theyre theyre just recalibrating well theres a lot of this its all its all distraction and the difference is that last year when they lost a bunch of games they were challenged and they were questions it was motivated I think the issue that theyve dealt with is that another quick turnover here one of the issues that Carolinas dealing with that is outside noise with these guys testing the draft you got agents you got theyre getting pat on the backs and a lot of times the pad on their backs arent motivating all off season you get told how good you are right you get told you think youre gonna light up put your shoes on and reappear in the national championship game and as this team is finding out its just not that simple now theyre being hunted man the four starters that come back preseason number one and now a threegame losing streak could be four but plenty of time left 7 21 North Carolina on a mini run theyve made three in a row here picking up full courts they made a 10point game yeah next to the defense this game is far from over theres no quit in this team they just got to make this consistent effort on the defensive end no matter whos on whos only on the court whos not on this end of the floor is where they got to be better six nothing Run for the Tar Heels in the last minute Double T Maddox in trouble keeps it alive Padula pulls the trigger cant hit it and a foul called its going to be North Carolina ball Maddox reaching in on the rebound the Hokies have fallen in a twominute scoring drought its allowed North Carolina to get right back in this game I think guys are turning down shots on the offensive end for Virginia Tech theyre getting looks theyre letting the clock run down and then Carolinas doing a great job also but hes dribbled handoffs to these ball screens theyre dropping him now and its giving Virginia Tech some trouble theyre giving Virginia Tech a dose of their own medicine North Carolina in the second half doing an excellent job getting for the foul line theyve already attempted 10 foul shots in this half alone Davis makes the front end of a one and one that could be the recipe too just get to the foul line well maybe thats just the way they need to play theyre not shooting the three great so attack the paint even off the dribble or in the post Davis connects on both just like that an eightnothing Tar Heels run has brought it to an eightpoint game with just under seven to play frisky pass Collins comes up with it breaks the Press settles it with Justin mutts mutz will beat him as a point forward so to speak against any type of pressure that time he was on the opposite side and Padula couldnt inbound the ball to him Collins for three got it MJ Collins delivers from three the Hokies had missed their last seven threes before that make good confidence shot there they trapped in the post and Carolina was late to rotate over Nance off balance off the back for him no good Justin mutz with his ninth rebound on his way to one more rebound for DoubleDouble hes great pass Collins rejected at The Rim twice kept in play nine seconds to shoot plenty of time left Motts calling for it then they call RJ Davis for a foul Huber Davis cant believe it Music Seth Trimble just coming over Applause what a great block Applause Cubas not happy with the call but great defensive effort there by Seth Trumbull thats a great block Applause backtoback blocks this is the way Carolina needs to play no matter whos on the floor you see the fight in this team right now great intensity and I think thats what frustrated Huber Davis so much but his defense responds gets the turnover Caleb love Applause theyre just showing you what theyre capable of and again more practice time and Reps youll see more of this great ball movement easy layup for Pete Nance Applause Seth trimbles doing a great job of setting the tempo right now too on the ball Applause theyve got a different look in their eye right now defensive intensity Collins a three rims out no good Music Applause five minutes to play here Comes North Carolina another easy bucket RJ Davis timeout North Carolinas made five of their last six they are right back in this game the hot spots and pressure points on your mattress could be why you were tossing and turning most of this game Randolph the man stepped it up on the offensive end when they got into their half corsets but the Catalyst of this is like that generating offense from the defensive end of the floor Carolinas extended their defense here in the second half and theyve dug themselves theyve scratched back and got themselves back in this game Virginia Tech had an 18point late lead seven and a half minutes ago since then North Carolina on an 187 run theyve dialed up the defensive pressure the intensity much needed that bucket the goto man now 23 points on the night its a great job by much identifying the mismatch he knew he had RJ Davis on him and just turned his back backing down to the Post nothing but air quick shot to Carolina got plenty of time if you run your half court offense and execute something Tyler Nichol to learn as hes young in his career here butts wants it again trying to hit a cutting Padula turnover lets go look by Justin mutts good idea just coming in a little hot Purdue told him good pass I think Carolina got to come a little bit earlier on that trap its a little delayed allowing him a chance to kind of look at the landscape and find weak side cutters Applause heres Caleb love Runner got it to go thats the scary thing about love and Davis when they get going when theyre playing well in close games like that theyre just so explosive and difficult to start they each have 16 points tonight to lead the Tar Heels they are willing this team back trailed by as many as 18 tremble called for the reachin hes been really good on defense down the stretch weve got a fun finish a little more than 3 30 left in it lion the official grocer of the ACC Randolph Childress Jay alter with you the Tar Heels dont look now they trailed by 18 theyve done it with defense and without Armando baycott Randolph battling back in this game theyve cut the Hokies lead to seven thats what youre gonna have to do youre missing your big youre missing you know your first team AllAmerican and youre missing your best player and what theyve done or your most productive player and I think now theyre resting their identity on the defensive end which is what Carolina have to do they have to pick up anytime you miss a big piece like this your defense has to elevate and then you pick your moments in the game for each guy offensively to kind of add a piece that responsibility doesnt rely on just one guy Music medulla only one of two up from the line 3 30 to go in regulation Caleb love RJ Davis each with 16 points and really hadnt shot and shot the ball really well today no poor shots and thatll both well going forwards up to three and drills it Pete Nance timeout Huber Davis the Tar Heels have cut it to five relying on your veteran guys you mean Davis Love and and Nance coming I mean you put the ball in loves hand he comes off and switching ball screens hes late no rotation and Pete Nash lines one up we got ourselves a game here folks North Carolina just two of 12 from three before that Nance triple I youre down 18 on the road yeah Castle County seems going crazy you dont have your ACC preseason Player of the Year and yet your team finds the toughness to battle back the same as just showing you what theyre made of its showing you what theyre capable of I mean we talking about this in a threegame loser streak that was late game collapses I mean they were up late against Alabama they were up late against Iowa State its just late game collapses have caused them put them in a situation theyll dig their way out of it I dont think anybodys questioning that theyre just gaining some level of experience from these younger guys on the bench as you see now Trimble getting late minutes on the floor right now you got two freshmen out there tremble the Nickels out there on the court right now for this freshman for Carolina Motts gives it right to love and one and one one Caleb love flung it up there with the foul and its a one possession game Carolinas pressure is really bothering Virginia Tech right now the trapping they got the Trap and this is what they wanted they wanted to get the ball to adjusting much hands throws a bad pass there but dude look at Mr foul still a onepoint possession game cant complete its a threepoint play but one possession game three minutes to go here in Blacksburg Virginia Tech led by 18 in this second half North Carolina Furious comeback mutts hes a oneman Wrecking Crew 25 points for much tonight picked on a freshman right there there with the back screen he was guarding the silly freshman Nichols didnt switch and mutts got an easy layup Nance takes another three comes up short you like to get something at least get the ball touching the pain if youre Carolina but you still got plenty of time foreign taking Virginia Tech out of making them use ball screens now brazili five seconds to shoot drives right by the freshman and Tyler Nichol commits the foul Applause mutz gets it theyre setting the back screen you cant see it freshman right there nickels got to switch that and stay he didnt much gets the young contest to lay up there Music Virginia Tech now four of eight from the foul line and a big one coming from Grandpa zilli cube is showing a lot of confidence in his freshman right now Trimble and nickel have stayed out there through crunch time here comes a freshman for the Hokies MJ Collins and Mike young calls a timeout a little breathing room for Virginia Tech after North Carolina cut it to three the lead is back to seven ACC pm weekdays for Easter time Im sure tomorrow a lot of bold talk with the football bowl games being announced today as well as a lot of basketball as conference way is underway and you have felt that throughout the afternoon here at Castle Coliseum great intensity at the first ACC game of the season for these two teams this game has been everything we expected I mean if Carolina came on little Sluggers but man had they come on late second half I mean they picked up their defensive intensity lets give them Virginia Tech some some discomfort just bother them I mean you cant let them sit down in a half court offense and run their cutting and movement and back doors and everything and credit to North Carolina they shown some of that Championship caliber DNA no Armando baycat today dealing with soreness Hubert Davis told us before the game and yet an incredible comeback effort they trailed by 18 they cut it to three now trailing by seven with under two minutes to play Nance righty hook doesnt drop Carolina got the look they wanted got Pete Nance on the ball screen on the switch but Padula could finish double team panulla passes through it Applause Carolinas got to get a stop here and they do stolen away by RJ Davis now can they cash in on the other end you dont need a three through contact the Freshman Seth Trimble delivers up ahead to mutts does well to keep it in bounds Padula wide open from three he buries it thats a gutsy shot they struggle from three he hasnt shot a particularly great tonight but when the game out he stepped up and hit a three there thats a big time shot desperation three goes begging offensive rebound nickel up and in and a timeout by Hubert Davis final timeout two possession game but a huge three from Sean Padula I mean hes earned the right as coach said at halftime to take these shots and nones been bigger than that and thats why hes coachs young goto guy clutch shot there teams been struggling pressures been bothering him put it in your best player hand and ask him to make a play you can live with it either way and fortunately for the Hokies he made the shot not always about how many you make is when you make them if that doesnt go in everyones saying why didnt you kill more clock but well thats part of what happens youre trying to thats a little bit of what got them in trouble they start running their offense and trying to stall youre trying to run clock you get past it Carolinas running around theyre trapping you theyre rotating you youre playing passive thats an aggressive shot so the way you combat being faster its just to get aggressive and you can live with your best player being aggressive Music so North Carolina out of timeouts Mike young and Virginia Tech still have two at their disposal two possession game Virginia Tech basketball if youre North Carolina you try and get the steal but then the foul has to come pretty quickly you dont want to give Virginia Tech a full possession here right well now the enemy is the clock yeah so you try to score quickly you dont have to have a three and if you cant score quickly you try to track you got enough time now when you try to trap get a steal if you cant then you gotta foul Padula had missed all four threepoint attempts before that make Applause and for the year months is only a 54 threepoint shooter so Im pretty sure in that time out coach Davis is letting this guys know who to foul and the Freshman Collins is five for five on a year but he hadnt shot a lot so you always want to put a freshman in this situation with a free throw line late if you can they get the ball to Padula thats who you dont want to foul no and yet they might have to a ton of time coming off the clock risky pass mutz comes up with it now you got to foul too much time coming off this clock 16 seconds came off the clock before the foul came in thats the problem you have when you do trap the team does a great job of spacing you just someones going to be wide open and Virginia Tech did a really good job of identifying that person and getting in the basketball Virginia Tech on the afternoon five of nine from the freethrow lines and heres the Freshman MJ Collins Music one and one nothing but the bottom of the net plus shots about a freshman thats not easy to do man thats a big shot right there you dont want to have an empty possession but front end of a oneonone weve seen it countless times when someone missed that shot another team pushes it down and scores no longer a two possession game either time not on the side of North Carolina career high eight points with those foul shots yeah nothing but net for the freshman Davis has to hurry Heats it up a foul called so two coming at the line for RJ Davis Applause you dont want the clock to stop your Virginia Tech Andre doe drove the ball much bumped him right there enemy is Carolinas clock right now so Virginia Tech you dont want to foul because you just dont want to stop the clock Applause Tar Heels out of timeouts Virginia Tech has two so you use your substitutions now you bring in your veteran guys you explain to them kind of block your commands from the sideline theyre going to deny try to get a five second count maybe a quick trap in an immediate foul back to a two possession game 24 seconds remaining Lots the inbounder you want his size inbounds in the basketball Applause Padula passes out of the double team and mutts is fouled thats what you want great thing is he inbounded the basketball sprinted ahead of it made himself available got the foul its not easy to do Sprints and Bounds gets it back its not a luxury a lot of teams have and now Virginia Tech enters the double bonus so much gets two here a lot less pressure on you hes not shooting the great but two possession game already is not a ton of pressure Carolinas running out of time here Hokies have made their last five free throws might be all she wrote for the Tar Heels after that one need a quick three Applause got to get a quick three here you dont have time not enough time left to love from the logos doesnt go foul comes in come back effort from North Carolina on the road fall short they did but again were talking about it before theres no Panic in this Tarheel team they showed you why theyre preseason number one I know they dropped four in a row theres a lot of distractions a lot of talk out there but this team will be fine theyll get home get some home cooking for the Tar Heel faith will love on him a little bit theyll respond and theres definitely no Panic in that guy hes as cool the customers they have because there is around Applause deep three from Davis goes begging Virginia Tech opens ACC play with a convincing win great Harford game we knew it would be again the biggest surprise for us is not having Armando Bay cut out start after finding out that DeMarco Dunn will be out for extended period of time so Applause a lot of questions if youre a Target fan and they got to get back but again I think its nothing that for
