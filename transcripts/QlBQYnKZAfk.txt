where they are 10 and two at the Peterson Event Center here on campus we are set for the opening tip ready to go great to have you with us tonight as we get started and pit wins the opening tip Joey brackets has pit in the NCAA tournament field right now following their loss to Wake Forest on Saturday they have a very favorable schedule the rest of the way including a game like tonight where of course they are favored at home but OB with the nonconference schedule not going very well for the ACC one of my comments earlier was that you would have to win about you know 15 13 14 15 ACC games to get it at large bid if you dont win the tournament the Panthers with five losses already dont need to give away an opportunity on their home floor tonight the Virginia team getting outrebounded for the year rather shockingly theyve turned it over more times than their opponents thats very unver Virginia likee yes thats something that havent seen from Virginia much but a very young team Ron Sanchez having to coach right now and the inexperience is shown throughout the season both teams off to a choppy start on their first possession here inside the first minute typical of Virginia Whittle it down to the last few seconds of the shot clock Ron Sanchez who spent 10 years as Tony Bennetts assistant and he had previously served as a head coach at charlet between 2018 and 23 as well Zack Austin giving it up here to Cameron Corin at 610 flipped up and in by ishma Le the 63 senior one of the two standout guards for the pit Panthers Virginia with their starting lineup and keep an eye on DayDay Ames hes a guy who can really explode beyond the threepoint line McNeely top at 42 beyond the three ases with a pull up here and thats going to be offt Target and tipped out off of Austin and that means out off of the pit Panthers yeah miscommunication by the Panthers Jaylen low as well as Zach Austin both going after the same rebound you would expect for someone to be vocal let them know that they have it but as a guard thats your opportunity to get out of the way make sure the bigger guy gets the rebound point of his St thats right now heres mcney coming up 19 points on Saturday also seven assists hes an outstanding passer going high off the window but that wont drop and pit wants to run l in transition he comes in averaging 17 points a game lay it on the spin Little Fall away and it rolls out but you see how dangerous the Panthers guards are getting into the painted area we saw leot with the runner earlier and they are intent to getting into the paint trying to break down Virginias Applause defense G up top for one of the two starters to return from Tony vennetts last NCAA tournament team GES beond the three MC on the dish and a whistle and a foul on the play as Virginia look to go inside trying to get it in strong to the 611 Buchanan and thatll send Buchanan to the line Buchanan the 611 sophomore out of Idaho only 54 at the foul line andanan starting to give Virginia more positive minutes in the post area Virginia playing without Elijah Saunders for the third straight game who is their leading score in the post second leading score on the team and also their leading rebounders so its been a benefit to guys like a Blake Buchan and to Jacob Kofi because theyre getting more opportunities but for Virginia its been difficult having to go without sers on the floor simply because how much he provides on you both offensively and Applause defensively Corin gets a touch hell take it out back off for low hes only 28 beyond that threepoint line hes going to drive it with that left hand Nifty move there but thats where hes so dangerous especially when you switch and youve got a much taller player trying to defend him on the perimeter Jaylen Lows as quick as it gets in the AC hard for a big guy to step out and guard him on the perimeter well as ever Virginia does not want want a track meet of a game and theyre only scoring 63 points a game so they do not want to go up and now at the pit Panthers tonight if they can avoid that ases off for mcil and thats going to be off the front of the iron rebound tipped and a nice job moving inside to grab that one by Anthony Robinson and hell draw the foul but that play was made by Blake Buchanans ability to be able to attack the offensive board and on the other end the previous possession Jaylen low off the bound the Lefty going off the left foot and the left hand layup to keep it away from the shot Blocker in Robertson Robinson the youngster The Freshman whos starting to get a lot more playing time from Ron Sanchez here in recent games yeah without Saunders you know theyve been able to get guys more minutes and more experience a red shirt freshman and Robinson who so hes getting opportunity to be able to get true game minutes and thats truly the only way to develop at this level is to see what you do against opposing competition saers is going to miss his third game thats 12 points six rebounds a game for the 68 Junior and a 40 threepoint shooter so add that to the mix but hes his presence has been missed more on the defensive end OB than actually has offensively Virginias giving up 50 from the field to its last two opponents with alanders on the floor you mention it both coming off heartbreaking losses Virginia losing by one point on Saturday on the road at Virginia teeken the pit Panthers losing by two against Wake Forest in a game they had a chance to win ases will give it up back outside beyond the threepoint line hell launch one and knock it down he can be instant offense he absolutely can and he can be a much welcome added addition to beyond the threepoint arc when you consider we know roie can shoot the basketball McNeely the best from percentage points in Virginia history right behind well right there with KY guy so when you think about the fact that these two guys can be dynamic from Beyond the threepoint Arc and thats when Virginia is normally successful when theyre making threes theyve had some big scoring games well Isaac mcy with 42 beyond that three certainly A Difference Maker Ames will launch another one but no and the rebound will be tipped up and in by Robinson and again for Virginia whenever you get multiple opportunities on a possession thats going to help you out Robinson attacking the offensive glass we saw Buchanan come up with one earlier and give Virginia a lot of credit for the way they continue to fight for Co Sanchez even though things AR have necessarily gone their Direction and there in a 6 nothing run and that one turned over by Pittsburgh so well take a timeout our first media timeout coming up a closer look and runs for that he doesnt control the outcome all he can do is influence the players that control the outcome and if you live each and every day based upon the outcome and the score its going to be a miserable life its simply about building the relationships and allowing your players to be confident to help them be successful Id love to pick up a road win Virginia two and seven on the road they last defeat was at home Buchanan trying to get a handle on it underneath nice pass in the lane Robinson gets it back to him bu Canon missing the bunny underneath and finally a whistle and Virginia had many good opportunities there right near the cylinder and thats the fourth and fifth offensive rebounds early in this game for Virginia they at three Z advantage and points his second chance points and now opportunity for panan to get more but when you looking at what Virginias doing right now playing with the two bigs on the floor these are young guys they came in together of course Robinson red shirted his first year but when you get these opportunities as day the Ames gets to the rim you have to take advantage of them we talk about being younger players this is what is helping the front court right now for Virginia getting these minutes in live game action but an empty position on that buan the only return to play in every game last year 611 sophomore done up top he had 24 against Wake Forest on Saturday in that heartbreaking defeat for them shot clock is down to seven the pullup pop and thatll clang away off Target by Austin itll rattle free Virginia will scoop it up on the hands of roie really thought about a we down downtown three certainly very capable of hitting Applause that t Murray in the 65 senior back off a long one and thatll be nothing but n by roie and roie who missed the Miami game coming back against Virginia Tech looking more and more comfortable hes had to take on more of a role as a point guard throughout this season and more of a playmaker actually leads Virginia in assist per game here comes the long one by low and that one clangs away itll be knocked out by pit Obie we talked with Jeff cable earlier today about having to get over a heartbreaking loss on the road if you watch this pit Panthers team right now it looks as though they have a little bit of a hangle Virginia has come out with a much more positive attitude and approach to this game that weve seen from the Panthers but it looks as though some of the players may have a little hangover from that loss on Saturday Virginia certainly the crisper team shot clock winding down had to fire it up there wont go for him and another rebound here by the Cavaliers maray takes it out High near the logo Here Comes mcne shot that one drop but thats the aggressive ISAC mcney that Virginia needs hes averaging over 20 points per game in the last four games they need him to be aggressive not only to create opportunities for himself but his teammates as well they get tripped up and fou hit without a score in the last four minutes and give you a look at the resume right now net of 35 just one and six against quad ones beat Ohio State beat West Virginia and Joe lonardi right now saying they are among the last four in and which is part of the reason why they cant afford bad losses and again tonight against Virginia who was 3 and 8 in ACC 10 and 12 overall this will be considered a bad loss if Pittsburgh is unable to win this game no doubts low to penetrate lost the handle J Murray doing a great job getting a hand in then diving on the floor after the basketball and for the first you know 7 and 1 half minutes of this one Virginias just been much more energetic and quicker to the basketball loose balls Etc and four turnovers for them just one for Virginia MC looking to keep it rolling Ames will pull up and pop and drained it got a great look and sunk the shot and you know when youre day and you have opportunity to go up against a Jaylen low who many consider to be if not the best one of the best point guards in the league this is something that you take personal and you see D Day Ames is absolutely taken upon himself to be more aggressive throughout this game and going right at jayen low leg trying to dump it downstairs tough catch and batted away and that was mcne forcing their fifth turnover for pit great effort by mcneel Le to be able to get back into that action knock it away and then come up with the basketball as Virginia continues to fight thats one of the things Ron Sanchez told us his team is fighting so hes going to fight for his team one of the reasons he got a technical foul in the game on Saturday against Virginia Tech ases with a shot clock to six good interior ball movement the shots going to drop there for Robinson and the Robinson giv Virginia great minutes early coming off when you consider I did not know that Mr Rogers was a Pittsburgh Legend know about of course Roberto K I know I know all of that but Jason wford associate head coach at the University of Virginia is family his mother Barbara fersi by the way is from Pittsburgh so he has a tremendous amount of family here and hes normally always giving me the Pittsburgh history but he didnt tell me Mr Rogers was here this was his town right now the Cavaliers making it a fun place for them absolutely is off to a great start and again when you consider both teams coming off of heartbreaking losses over the weekend you always want to see how your team responds and so thats the thing we watched Virginia in shoo around earlier today and they had a very positive attitude thats what we were talking with with Ron Sanchez about you know his job is to make sure that these guys are confident that theyre enjoying their experience its not about the outcomes the outcomes will take care of theel if theyre confident Applause tend to shoot here for pit and for Leed Leed will fire it up long range and not there to tough rebound it by roie 66 Applause Jr and Virginia up on top 16 to4 to 15 to nothing scoring run and for pit its been over 6 minutes since they got on the board this defense is starting to remind you of the Virginia Defense weve watched for the last 15 years under Tony Bennett but youve got to give the guys a lot of credit for continuing to fight even though things havent gone well but offensively Virginia is slicing up the Panthers right now getting everything they want on the offensive into the floor games with the quick strike 18 to4 and one very quiet building here trying to end the scoring ground finally a whistle underneath as we get it over to Myron yeah Jeff cell in that time I was furious with his team he talked before the game about toughness he said he didnt like that his team wasnt fighting hard enough he said youve got to fight through screens and you got to watch so youre not getting screen and thrown off your path that was the biggest message during that time out this team being tougher against Virginia myrin you and I talked with Coach C earlier today about how he was responding after the loss and he said it was tough for him to get over but of course you got to move on does it look as though his players have moved on ging going hard to the 10 hell draw another whistle and a foul that was with nine on the shot clock but its been seven minutes this scoring drought for the pit Panthers on their home floor and a foul will go against tane Murray now the Duke Alum felt his team got snubbed last year by the selection committee despite 22 wins and 12 wins in the ACC and they were boxed out of the NCAA tournament Im in agreement with them I thought they also should have been invited to the tournament a season ago but The Narrative of the ACC being down I believe absolutely affected both pit and Wake Forest last year and its amazing to me how there still could be five teams from the ACC to make it and what in all honesty has been a year that has been unlike any other in ACC basketball so if youre going to say a year has been down this would be the one but the accs gotten five teams in the last three consecutive years so how was it how is that the case where youre still possibly going to get five when you were supposedly down when the league was much better and you do so much damage once you get to the tournament I think for a lot of folks the feeling is theres Duke Head and Shoulders yes so much higher than everybody else they showed that against Carolina certainly shot misfires by roie and here come the pit Panthers trying to string some points together Leed on the entry theyre really looking for Corin in that paint and hell draw another whistle and mcne mcney was limping on the other end of the floor he fouls Corin there but keep an eye on Isaac mcney of course extremely important to the success of the Virginia Cavaliers and right now you can see something going on with McNeely as hell check out of the Music game so the Junior from West Virginia hits the bench were recapping teams inside the conference and look at their resumes and of course Duke at the top of everything an 11 and0 15 game winning streak Cooper flags been off the charts 23 points per game in ACC play and ishma Lega gets another field goal only the third field goal for the Panthers and two of them have been by leged in this game attacking the painted area where we were expecting to see the Panthers guards in the paint all evening long but Virginias done a great job keeping them out of the paint as well as knocking down to three the third made threepoint field goal for the hoops and Ames 38 out there absolutely drilled it terrific ball movement to find the open shooter dun trying to get started he can really get rolling offensively but not this time and a foul here against the pit Panthers over the back and the big gu mod Diaz Graham the sevenfooter whistled for that foul as we recap Clemson you and I will get a look at them coming up on Saturday against the Duke Blue Devils and weve got a special guest going to be joining us for that one as well welcome back of course to the legend Dicky V they will be joining us on Saturday Duke vers Clemson cannot wait texting with Dicky V today he talking about how excited he was OB I think I may be more excited youve worked with Dicky v a lot but it will be my first time Im looking so forward to I think were going to have a great great time and just seeing him back where he belongs right court side any Court in America frankly but I know the folks at Clemson going to do a great job for Dicky V in his return Sharm from the corner will knock it down and everybody getting in the ACT offensively for Virginia and Virginia now four of eight from Beyond the threepoint line 50 shooting the basketball extremely well we said in the beginning when theyre making threes theyre dangerous 14 threepoint field goals against villain Nova in a neutral sight with probably their biggest win of the Year straight on but that wont drop for low rebound comes out high and Virginia has it again Virginia is getting every loose ball they are they theyre quicker to the basketball theyre playing with way more energy and you can see the frustration on Jeff cable as hes watching his team Pittsburgh Iowa State and Kansas all lost on Saturday Kansas with a 19point halftime lead lost by double figures to Baylor at Baylor so Im sure Bill self without much time to spend getting his team prepared definitely got the message across to them in practice D AMS with a touch hes been a hot hand for the Cavaliers with 10 Sharma coming off the bench firing away it just hit one moments ago Virginias won in this game by the way when they ripped off a 17 nothing was their longest such streak of the season so far Austin on the drive got too far underneath and hes going to turn it over with a Trav violation and OB Im going to tell you what it is heres the secret well tell the world its the orange uniforms Virginia wearing the orange uniforms for the second time this season they did not wear them for 15 years Tony Bennetts first year wore the orange uniforms at Duke got beat by 30 never wore them again now mind you I was doing radio for Virginia Tony Bens first year team wasnt that good so if youre going to base anything on that right it shouldnt have been taken away the best colorway of uniforms that the University of Virginia has so with Tony Im not surprised once again they get a good shot but cant convert Here Comes low he will drive it fire it short went for his own rebound knocked out of play by Virginia and pit right now just not cohesive offensively two great guards in Leed and low who combin for 34 points 10 rebounds and about nine assists per game but theyve been shut off for the most part they have they have the three field goals as low as able to get another one now they have the four field goals two a piece but everything has been attacking the paint all that pit has thus far is layups as over the top and the slam as Buchanan goes up high to slam it in but Virginia handling the pressure very well and that is an area where they struggled early in theas season so Ron Sanchez preparing his team for the pressure handling well getting the easy bucket not sure how long pit will be able to stay in that Austin too strong Robinson with the rebound Virginia certainly not looking like a 10 and 12 team they absolutely are not but and thats one the thing their staff talked to us about today these guys are fighting theyre just young and inexperience but theyre still continuing to fight learning each and every day and now youre starting to see some of the fruits of their labor mcney trying to penetrate and kick AES deep in the corner shock clock of factor now down to three as he lets it Go and hits it and DayDay Ames has the reputation of being a scorer hasnt had a great scoring season but youre starting to see a little bit of his scoring prowess now knocking down his third three of this first half and a whistle here 526 to go in a quick moving first half as the shot clock starts to run down this is opportunity for DayDay ases to really play make an individual play I believe they counted that one as a two it looks as though his left foot was on the line so two for three from Beyond the threepoint art but still double figures Ames averages just over six points per game has already doubled his average here in the first half good officiating crew here tonight Ron gr Clarence Armstrong and Tommy morrisy Ron gr gave us the ultimate compliment early today he says his wife loves us I mean you dont hear that off I Ill bet weve had Ron on the floor in games weve done 15 times this year he does a terrific job8 seconds on the shot clock and a whistle a foul on that play and thatll go against Isaac mcney of Virginia his second now Ron Sanchez really happy with the way things are going on the road here in Pittsburgh tonight the the road has been a struggle for the whoos As you mentioned two and seven and Leed cant hit the first one this is a team that didnt miss a foul shot on Saturday there 20 for 20 right we get a look at DayDay Ames whose foot was on the line that called that correctly as a two but still a bucket for Virginia as they continue to operate extremely well on the offensive end of the floor 526 from the field four of nine from three the only thing they havent done to this point is shoot free throws only four of six seven but theyll take where they are offensively in this first half only 10 points for pit now one note about their foul shooting theyre one of the great foul shooting teams in the country Pittsburgh makes 80 Applause and wondering how they get beat over the weekend because the other guy went 20 for 22 right bit had a score record of May free throws without in Miss in the game 20 for 20 but Wake Forest me 20 of 22 another very good free throw shooting team wake made two more threes as day as continues to cook wow Day saying night night he is loving it here tonight hes made it 301 hes had a tremendous first half new arrival from Kansas State this year orge Diaz Graham who makes 59 Beyond a threepoint line with a rare misfire for him indicative of the first half its been for Pittsburgh not much going right at all no and they cant stop Virginia as they get a turnover finally an opportunity to get jayen low out in transition see if he can take advantage of it l gives it up for his back court mate Lay It Off the spin no and thats going to go the other way the foul will go against Pittsburgh and they will get Diaz Graham Jorge for the foul well this is a stunner I know it is for that man right there Jeff cable that his team is down 20 and its probably more of a stunner that they only have 10 points this Panther team averages over 86 points per game in this building throughout the season and so theyve always play well offensively here at times their defense has let them down but its never been their offense in this building in front of their home crowd DayDay aims the story DayDay with 14 in the first half came in averaging six Applause Virginia blow looking to make a move on the drive and Applause kick shot clock at six heres Cummings fires that one up there and hell draw the foul as he attempts a threepointer so he will be at the line to shoot three tane Murray with the personal day day Ames having himself an evening here in Pittsburgh to cross over the step back knocks down to three leading the way with 14 early points for the ho Music Dre I absolutely would show a DayDay but theyre on VHS and thats the problem Im not sure if anybody has VCRs anymore I got to get the Highlights tough to get digital those digital yeah tough to get now but I mean to cess point and you and I came on the air talking about the exact same thing these are simply the kind of games if youre the pit Panthers you cannot come out like this and play in front of your home fans and thats the story again being here at home after a tough loss on the road one of the things that associate head coach Jason Willer told the his team of Virginia is that theyre going to be perturbed Ill use that word thats not what he said but that theyre not going to be happy coming in here after the way they lost on the road but we have not seen that P team we saw it from Jeff C earlier but we have not seen it from his guys on the floor hope he got downstairs pit defended him very well loose ball shot clock is at one they need a he doesnt see it and thats a shot clock violation isan Sharma let it expire he was not sure of the clock at all and it cost him and but those are the type of plays that Ron Sanchez has talked to us about its just inexperienced that they havent been in the situation before and so often times theyll theyll make mistakes and plays to end up costing him the game especially in a one possession game like the game against Virginia Tech at home on Saturday ger The Freshman from Canada jge Diaz Graham will give it up as mentioned he is an outstanding threepoint man at 61 Here Comes one and nothing but net and thats what Jorge Diaz Graham absolutely does he is a shooter and at 6 11 he can get his shot off against pretty much any defense hes on the floor right now for Jeff capable to provide some offense they hit their first three not a lot of time left before halftime but a lot of time left in the game for the pit Panthers to claw back into this thing which theyre trying to do but a tough move downstairs bu Canon with the bucket and you can see the confidence with Blake duanan growing each and every game OB this young man had 18 points in his third career game for Virginia and has not reached that point since so again hes had some struggles and battled with some confidence throughout his career thus far far but having a strong performance here this evening low on the Move 17 points a game hell take the knock with a minute 39 before the break and 3216 Virginia and two of the featured super Tuesday college basketball matchups number 14 Kentucky and number 25 Old Miss squaring off on ESPN at 7 on ESPN 2 number 13 Texas teken Baylor back on ESPN out to the West Coast prime time between Arizona and BYU we talked about bounce back Monday well you got a little bit of bounce back on Tuesday as well Kentucky who took the loss in the home floor going to Old Miss where you and I were on Saturday Auburn the number one team in the country was able to come into Old Miss and get a win so both those teams going to be going at it of course every game in the SEC is extremely competitive and meaningful as well that is a tough environment had a great crowd third best crowd they ever had for an Old Miss Basketball game was an outstanding effort by Auburn on the road heres Music roie with eight to shoot it for Virginia har tried to take the Baseline that comes free and they turn it over again theyve had a number of those here the last three or four minutes and low will back it out leged Airborne two one thing for certain you are absolutely going to have to de with the guards from Pittsburgh attacking theyre going to try to get into the painted area its Mel legett now with three field goals and all of them have been in the Applause pain Buchanan on the high post heres Day Day Ames who has been magnificent in the first half with 14 was a 20point lead down to 13 already thought about one and tipped away with five on the shot clock but if you look look at the lineup youve got the starting back court and then three reserves on the floor for the Panthers right now Jorge Diaz gram bringing a lot of energy right now getting a deflection and putting Virginia in a tough spot only 5 seconds remaining on the shot clock and Virginia will take a timeout and well be back in 30 seconds we have 324 to go in the first half here 324 seconds before the break here at Pittsburgh and VG has been outstanding they have stunned the pit Panthers who are 14 seven and 10 two here at the Pete but danger time now for Virginia its important to go into the halftime locker room with positive momentum Ames wants to drive it scoop said got another one and thats how you get it Day Day Ames now up to 16 first half points he has been nothing but positive momentum for the whoos here in this first half as Jeff capable calls the timeout wanting to get a good look at the end of the first well be back in 30 seconds to see what coach cap draws up in the h Music Jeff cable drawing up the play here is team down 3419 and what you dont want to do is give Virginia another opportunity so even though youre down you know 15 points right now you want to make sure you get the last shot of the half because the worst thing that could happen for Pittsburgh even if they do score is to not be able to stop Virginia at the end of this half so you want to make sure you get the last shot if possible and get some positive momentum going into your halftime locker room in for low jayen L coming off of four for 14 shooting performance on Saturday Jeff Cap screaming to Brandon Cummings were going at 10 he doesnt want to go too Applause early 6 seconds before the break he goes around the back steps inside air mailed it the scoop is off the 10 Diaz Graham almost had a spectacular basket there not a lot went right for pit in that first 20 a lot did for Virginia and to 11 so thats significant and the score hugely significant for the pit Panthers they do have 20 minutes to do something about it and Virginia with the basketball open up the second 20 minutes here in Pittsburgh and Virginia was really able to have a lot of success without their leading score Isaac mcney getting going as well as their second leading score Elijah Saunders whos not playing in this game so give Ron Sanchez a lot of credit for preparing his team as data as is able to come up with the steal on the first possession defensively for Virginia yeah Leed just lost it and thats the kind of first half it was it begins much the same the second half with the pit Panthers buan with a little hook that wont drop and a whistle before the basket and so wave that off thatll go against Kofi of Virginia as we check in with myON well I talked to Ron Sanchez briefly as he was coming out of halftime he had a big smile on his face fellas and I said what was the message he said nothing nothing too hard share the basketball play together continue to play good defense and that was it and mying you remember coach Sanchez telling us earlier dont get too high dont get too low its his job job as the leader as the head coach to make sure he stays even kill so in the halftime locker room when things are going well he cant be too excited because the the extra level of excitement May cost his team in the second half he has to keep an even kill which of course Ron Sanz always does games will pick up the foul Obie we look at the lineup for the Panthers to start the second half youve got three of their traditional starters in there however Jorge Diaz Graham and Pap aladu at the free throw line right now both those guys came in and gave the Panthers some energy some life at the end of that first half so Jeff capable rewarding those two guys with starting them here the beginning of the second half Papa amadu at the line six1 freshman from Sagal who missed all of last year to a knee Music injury and his second got that and again pit if it does come down to foul shooting they have an advantage over everybody they play and I mean anybody in America because they hit 80 yeah struggled a little bit from the free throw line throughout this game only 741 but of course you call that a struggle when youre coming off a game where you win a perfect 20 of 20 on the road at w four Ro gives it up theres mcney on target with a triple and we talked about Isaac mcney didnt really get going much in the first half but knocks down his first attempt here in the second half and if Virginia gets him they can absolutely be dangerous low determined Drive in amongst the trees lost it and that was Ill advised and a turnover for the pit Panthers who at home are averaging 87 points a game they love to play here at the Peterson Event Center with their 10 and two but they have only 20 points 2 minutes into the second half pretty remarkable it absolutely is and you know Virginia will absolutely use as much clock as necessary here at the under 5 Seconds taking a shot so youre not going to have as many possessions if youre the Panthers but you cant get it all back at once the big underneath two bigs colliding there buten got up high and a rejection for Virginia and when you have of course amadante on the floor you dont have the scoring ability that you have with Cameron K but corn not necessarily having that energy earlier that was satisfactory to Coach Jeff cable so going to different direction to start the game underneath for the slam and a big dunk by Kofi the 610 freshman and Virginia showing no signs of let up here in the early moments of the second half and Virginia operating their mover blocker offense that pocket pass which of course has been a symbol of greatness for Virginia throughout the Tony benett era Ron Sanchez going back with some of that offensively as gr launch that hes got a sweet touch he really does he can absolutely catch fire was a perfect four of four against West vir you had 12 points in that game knocking down four threepoint field goals and Jeff capable has him on the floor now looking for an offensive punch you going to look at that whether it was a three or a two during the next dead ball this one definitely a threepoint attempt but it wont drop yanon keeps it alive roie will swing it heres Day Day Ames with another one rattling in a threepointer but you know the best part about that off the offensive rebound DayDay Ames didnt wait he didnt look to run clock he was hes on fire he figured Im going to let it go ahead and fly now not waiting for another opportunity he sure is a career high 19 points already for ases leged outside the threepoint line and nothing but net the response from the Panthers however theyre going to have to find a way to get some stops slow Virginia down because Virginia operating on all cylinders here offensively on the road aims the sophomore from Chicago has carried the load for Virginia and then some you know what it is OB its the orange he played for M irvan fire out of Chicago they wore the orange and black uniforms maybe day theys feeling at home with the orange onom to scoring big he grew up in Chicago and idolized Derrick Rose like so many others but he also left his mark on the Chicago hoop scene the reviso West Holiday Tournament Haso with some of the greatest Illinois high school players of all time including Derrick Rose and John shy but DayDay who played for kimwood Academy set the alltime market that tournament with 65 points he might not get there tonight fellas but it looks like hes going to get close if at this pace yeah he just might and day they playing for my guy Mike irvan when he was coaching at kimwood back in the day and of course also playing for the Urban Family if mik Urban fired Nike ebl and he we talked about in the first half his reputation is a score hes not the traditional point guard with Jaylen warley opting to transfer after Tony Bennett stepped away he became the deao point guard for this team OB thats not his game what were seeing from day today tonight this is truly what his game is getting a bucket spin in the away left that one short he is really feeling it he made 16 starts at K State as a freshman so youre right a legit scorer pit trying to claw back Applause inside heres grahe hitting the deck Austin will launch one up there that wont drop but you see OB this is just a different Panther team we watched them against North Carolina on this floor last week a huge performance to get a win as well as a huge performance from Zack Austin who made three threes in that game three of five but had a strong performance even on the defensive end he hasnt been able to get going as well as the guards havent really been able to get do much on the offensive end of the four L shot clock down to four RO with a long one and nothing but net way downtown Virginia now seven of 14 team from Beyond the threepoint Arc continue to have success and when theyre shooting the basketball like this it opens up so many different opportunities for their guys on the interior to get easy ones as well as get offensive rebound Le with a pull up yes they get the 63 senior averaging 17 and also six rebounds their guards really get to the glass they they get to the glass they got great rebounding guards youre talking about a combination of guards six three and under that both average over four rebounds per game thats rare in college basketball pit has it but they also average close to 34 points a game and thats not happening for them right now well leged really getting down there to dig it out on the run the kick here for Diaz Graham and that wont fall missed opportunity for the Panther should have been an easy layup ends up being a tough threepoint field goal opportunity for Jorge Diaz gram which he can knock it down but that was Zack Austin should have been able to lay in if it had been a better pass underneath and up and in a quick strike by Buchanan but we just mentioned OB when youre shooting the basketball this well it opens up opportunities on the inside when two Defenders have to go with mcney it makes things available for Buchanan on the inside we be inducted into the basith Basketball Hall of Fame when his career is finished as Austin knocks down a threepointer and you and get a chance to to be there to cover him one more time weve covered him so many times he is one of our favorite people one of our favorite coaches but one of our favorite people because its a great story too its a great story but hes been a great mentor to so many as we see Robinson with the offensive foul talk with Jeff cable about Coach Hamp earlier today he talked about how important hes been in his life and Jeff is the is the son of a coach but at the same time his father was the first first one telling him to listen to coach H the coach H would have insight for him Monty Williams whos NBA coach of the year talked to me about how coach ham talked him out of coaching college basketball and going into the NBA and of course hes been a tremendous mentor to me since I was 17 years old he was recruiting me back in the day and now that youre 19 lets go to myON L hon obviously a lot of stories of him help helping coaches around the country especially black coaches he was a Sal at Dow Chemical when Joby Hall called him and convinced him to resign and take an assistant job with Kentucky to become the first black assistant at Kentucky so that was a Monumental phone call that happened between Joe B Hall and lard Hamilton that affected and impacted college basketball history terrific story but myin heres the thing he was only at D chemical for one day he went to work on Monday and when he got the call he didnt even call in to tell him he wasnt going to be at work on Tuesday he bought a flight went straight to Lexington and never went back to Dow Chemical its actually one of my favorite coaching stories Ive heard in like the last 10 years and at the line guo Diaz Graham hell be shooting three here course he was on the receiving end talking about Diaz Graham of Cooper Flags Coast to Coast dunk on January 7 you and I saw that as well we did I still personally think its the best dunk Ive seen all season long and and again its up there but Kelly flag Coopers mom told me that she actually like Coopers dunk against Kansas over FY banga even more so than that myON and I and we we think that its Ian Jacksons dunk we think Ian Jacksons dunk was even even higher as we get an opportunity to look at North Carolina season recap hes been doing this throughout the game six and5 record in ACC play and they lost four of their last five and this weekend theyll have an opportunity for Retribution against this Panthers team who could be coming and very angry if theyre unable to come back from this 14point defn with the kick out R On Target right down to the very end of the shot clock and you when you look at Virginia is Shooters all over the perimeter especially with DayDay Ames playing the way he has McNeely tamame Murray and roie on the floor all three of these guys are very capable from Beyond The Arc at the moment Virginia does not look like a team thats going to let pit back in but we shall see a long time to go 12 minutes and L can have a big say in that dish underneath to Corin who used to play for Leonard there at Florida State and He will draw the foul by Blake Buchanan so 1153 to go pit down by 17 at home to Virginia on a big Monday at South Carolina get to go see my little big sis Don Staley do her thing on the sidelines and get to see Gino ARA as well so looking forward to that you got quite a schedule coming up not to mention the six games a week you call you well you know that that day will be squeezed in between you and I at Stanford vers Duke and then Duke at UVA right so thats the Saturday Monday combo Sunday Ill spend Columbia South Applause Carolina Pittsburgh playing little beat defense here done knocking that one away Panthers trying to turn up the pressure Virginia has been susceptible to pressure throughout this season and struggle with it at times specifically in the Memphis game at home but theyve handled it very well Ron Sanchez has talked about how his team continues to improve theyre growing up on the Fly and this not a team constructed of grad transfers of fifth year guys this is a young team mcne off a little curl will knock it down thats the leader of the team in mcney and he is a true Junior hes in his third year of college right now so you consider this is a young inexperience team but playing not playing rock of the night Pittsburgh getting it downstairs for a quick strike they had a 4 nothing lead in this game its been all Virginia since on top 5237 buer Dame with a season recap but taking a look at the teams in the ACC ACC tournament not that far away Tay Davis one of the most improved players in the ACC but not to names a different team having Marcus Burton back in the lineup shot clock of factor now down to three hukan with a dribble down cant connect rebound comes out to pit Panthers trying to turn the tide here with about 10 and a half minutes to go Jeff capable continues to look for combinations to help them on both ends of the floor Diaz Graham with a Miss from the corner thats Jorge the twin brothers at 611 and 7 ft Applause giving up the dribble the bounce feed Robinson a collision the whistle and wave off the basket I believe that may be a good basket though Ron Grover calling it off and the foul was on the shot attempt go against Cameron so Obie watch theres no foul here thats not the foul nothing called This is where the foul is and thats a shot attempt that should be a bucket were going to take a look with 1012 to go they did get Cameron cor a pit for the foul so I believe thats going to be a good bucket under review it is under review take a look now as a Panther fan you may be saying is this not a travel and it was a travel before the foul however that was not called either so without that being called this is going to end up being a good bucket an opportunity for a threepoint play for Anthony Robinson who has had a tremendous stand no basket will be a two shot foul we going to call it two shot foul no basket I dont know how the the ball went in and hanging on the rim I think is that maybe maybe thats it maybe its because but again I dont know that he hung on the rim this foul happens the ball goes through the net now hes fouled which is the only reason that he doesnt dunk that cleanly but he did shake the rim and he did hang on it just long enough we can take another look there to affect the shot I think thats the reason why as Robinson Applause Music misses take it another look again this is not the foul the foul happens here thats a shot attempt so regardless and maybe its the reason as youre talking about because he was on the rim to but its still a shot attempt hes trying to dunk the basketball so he has all right to be on the rim ends up being a onepoint possession for Virginia comparison to a possible threepoint possession Graham with a missfire got a great open look thats a shot he typically makes again making 59 beyond the threepoint line is Murray Day Day Aimes the story of the first half with Applause 16 he is head three in the second half over the top intended for Buchanan never got there the theft by Corin thats what Virginias done a great job of not turning the basketball over tonight and for the Panthers theyve got to take advantage of these extra opportunities when they get them low on the penetration yes thatll drop in he has that ability to really make it soft up to the rim yeah much needed bucket for Jaylen low attacking the paint once again the Panthers only shooting 34 from the field and look at Virginia at 56 so theyve gotten it done on the offensive end but now as the game gets closer Virginia cant play with pressure on them to be able to finish the open man and thatll go down from threepoint L and one thing youre not seeing Virginias not taking their foot off the gas Bel theyre letting the shots go theyre not waiting till the end of the shot clock when they have opportunities tame Mur on the last possession theyre letting it Fly especially when their sh Shooters get good look knocked away Buchanan got a hand on it now theyve got a three onone buray with a difficult angle but lays it up and in thats a tough shot and Virginia able to build the lead right back to 19 point Music Kim thank you very much and Virginia continues to play pretty solid basketball across the board and this one aims with a make gets him to 20 theyre shooting 58 for the game Cory just eight turnovers and only nine fouls so theyre staying away from fouling anybody theyre not stopping the clock and thats characteristics of Virginia basketball they dont foul often and they dont turn the basketball over so they dont give you opportunities especially when they get a lead to be able to get back into this and now theyve stretched this out to a 21point game in their favor before that threepointer there by Jorge Diaz Graham it was the largest lead of the night for Virginia and now youre going once again Zone pressure but you can see we watched Virginia work on this pregame so they were absolutely prepared for it but now pit back into his Zone defensively manto man has not worked with them Virginias ball movement people movement has allowed them to be sucessful successful especially when theyre knocking down threes at the rate they have tonight G faking to three this is something theyve done well all night moving the ball so effectively they got the open shot it didnt go but its a big reason they have this lead and seven minutes to go here at pit dun on the attack tried to flip it up there he drew the foul Obie we talked about ball movement and player movement Virginia doing things the right way Blake Buchanan doesnt touch the basketball in this possession but he makes a winning play watch him relocate and find someone to screen him screening Zack Austin allows for Tame Murray to get a wide open look Murray shooting over 40 knocks down the three ball and it was a tane Murray 5 run that pushed the lead back up for Virginia but Blake New Canon that will not show up in the stat sheet but that shows you how hes developing as a player and falling in line to exactly what Virginia needs him to do to be successful who had a little muscle since last year put on a little extra size yeah he did and again when youve got the best strength conditioning coach in the country and Mike Curtis you dont have a choice but to put on and you know and and again I know you where youre going yeah Mike Mike was on me a little bit today a little bit a little bit well you know but I had to Mike was on me because I come down the stairs with the pizza and two cookies and two cookies you thought you were eating all of those a whistle with 653 to go and leged will pick up foul number two Ron Sanchez continuing to coach up the young players and again he you see the smile and the conversation Ron made it very clear to us its about relationships its about these guys enjoying their time playing basketball at the University of Virginia thats what its about its not as much about the wins and losses but of course thats coach talk because for everyone else is about wins and losses mcne will bury one out of the corner 6344 Virginia just played a terrific game all night long and they have owned the floor here in Pittsburgh and this is going to be a very damaging defeat unless pit can rally and have a miracle run here in the next 6 minutes because they were the team on the cusp of the NCAA tournament in fact in as far as lonardi Joe lenardi was saying earlier I wonder what a loss like this would do on the cut that wont drop the follow is up and in by Robinson who continues to get effective minutes yeah great minutes from Robinson throughout this game and one thing that has not happened pit has not been able to make Virginia uncomfortable at all when they have the ball in their hands Virginias done everything theyve wanted on the offensive end throughout this game leg it on the drive the scoop thats the prettiest play of the game but theyve needed a whole lot more of that 6546 and a near theft and a in the backourt with 536 to go as lean went for the steal and convin the personal a nice find from McNeely to Ros unable to finish it but Robinson coming up with the put back on one end of the floor and then on the other and ishma leet attacking the basket the nice left hand reverse but as you mentioned not enough right now the Panthers are going to have to find a way to make some threes and more importantly find a way to get some stops on this end of the floor Applause Music a loss tonight for pit will be their sixth in the last eight games and this has been a pattern unfortunately for Pittsburgh a strong first half of the Season then you know conference play getting underway dun will drill that one for threepoint land Jeff G right now looking for any answers on the offensive end of the floor the pressure trying to find a way to turn Virginia over as they get an opportunity to turn over here trying to build some momentum done with a pull up pop from three and that clangs away that absolutely would have built momentum but it ends up being a breakaway wow quickly on the other end aims no one RAC back to get him done after the Miss just kind of stood around and Jeff cable just perplexed about the effort from his team throughout this game he talked with Myron at halftime and just talked about how Virginia had been more physical they were more prepared they were more everything throughout this game and when you have a net at 35 youre youre borderline right so when you consider a net 35 youre right there on that cut line for at large bids quad ones only one and six now they do have two quality wins but one of those two either at Ohio State or at home versus West Virginia wasnt a quad one win right now projected as a last four in but they dont have any bad losses this will be looked at because of Virginias record sure as a bad loss for the Panthers that theyre unable to overcome this 18point deficit before 39 remaining lets bring in Myron yeah after last season snub Jeff Campell said he hard took a hard look at the nonconference schedule which has helped him kind of get to this point he said he doesnt pay attention to the Bracketology as other guys on the staff who do that but players I talked to said they are certainly aware of the importance of games like tonights and those going forward as well you know theyve already played the more difficult part of their schedule certainly in a conference they face Duke and Louisville Clemson and just took on Wake Forest those are the Premier teams in the Duke of course is head and shoulders so thats been off the table already the rest of their schedule has loosened up for them and tonight is one of those games frankly they should be counting as a w they they should be counting as a w but Virginia came in with different plans and they have executed to Perfection for the first 30 36 minutes of this game but have to finish with the four turn over there allows leged to get the easy bucket to make it a 14point game GES working on a 20point game taking a little time off the clock nine to get a shot off here for Virginia roie back for AES some quick work there with the basketball and knocks it down boy he can slam on the brakes yeah forgive me I said 14 it was actually 16 at that point now ases puts it back up to 18 and even further away from the panther DD AES has had a terrific night for Virginia and pit has not had a man to counter Austin offt Target Andre Ro took a hit Tommy Morrison sees its going to call the timeout so well take the break as well 322 to go its been all this Daya a has absolutely been our star the night game check in brought to you by All State you know pit so good at home this year until tonight so doubly disappointing 10 and two here at the peak before encountering the Cavaliers here in the ACC tonight and OB we talked about it earli this looked like a team that had a hangover from a tough loss over the weekend where Virginia also had a tough loss on their home floor by one but yet their Spirit was a lot different in shoot around earlier today and and its showed here throughout this game tonight back up to 20 as Buchanan lays it in he has 10 points and nine rebounds so on the cusp of a double double roie has nine assists in the game check in brought to you by All State 242 to go and tonight Day Day the story on a big Monday three for five from threepoint land and the career high 25 in couny and the issue for Virginia all season long has been at the point guard position and also finding a reliable score other than Isaac mcney on the perimeter and tonight its been Day Day Ames he has taken over and and got started early in this game look confident from the start and just as Ron Sanchez talked to us about its not his job he doesnt determine the outcome he determines how his guys feel about themselves about their team when they go out onto the floor and you can see that Virginia was in High Spirits when they approach this game tonight in and out on the second a battle for the rebound look you can hit the deck and triggers it for ases and he will stop it in Blake Buchanan made that play once again hes got to get a tremendous amount of credit for the way that Virginias play we know that day has done is Jaylen low just turned his ankle so adding in this case injury to insult hopefully hes able to get up and walk this one off but turned his ankle on that possession and with some help sprung back up 7354 Virginia you see low going in and that he may have turned both ankles OB the left one we saw but the the right one was a little hit hes able to get up and walk off but Jeff cable going to make some changes in the lineup down the stretch as Jaylen low checks out at the line low and leged terrific guards but Virginia did good work on them really from the opening tonight one of the many things the Cavaliers did very effectively yeah and Virginias defense has struggled over the last two games theyve given up 50 from the field to their last two opponents in Miami and in Virginia Tech but you can see the difference in when youre making shots how you play on the defensive end of the floor and they have been locked in on both ends Austin with a turnaround swishes it in 145 to go here here at the Pete AES the story with 27 exploding tonight for Virginia and theyve shot the balls a team really well all night yeah pit right now in a Zone defensively going to sit back and allow Virginia to be able to just run the clock down on the cut mcy with a kick heres zes they leave him open again not this time still a positive possession for Virginia because you use the entire shot clock Austin straight on in and out got a great look and hes very reliable from three and 40 but were under a minute to go OB d as has absolutely been the star of this game but the production that Virginias gotten from Blake duanan and Anthony Robinson on the interior that is not something that will go unnoticed by Ron Sanchez Jason wiford Orlando voss staff at the University of Virginia they will absolutely make sure to praise the big guys the young big guys on the interior for their performance they near short get another crack at it and roie with nine assists in this one had seven on Saturday against Virginia Tech that was a heartbreaking defeat well tonight an entirely different story Virginia came out ready to go despite the first couple of possessions from that point on they really took off and absolutely buried the Panthers who never really got back in it did they they absolutely did not and this could be a very damaging loss for the Panthers when you consider where they sit with their net ranking as well as where they sit as far as rocketology is concerned to this point the first bad loss for the Panthers this season and the final will be 7357 thats a stunner as pit goes down at home to a Virginia team to just
