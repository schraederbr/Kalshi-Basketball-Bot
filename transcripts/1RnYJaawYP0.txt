program Tommy morrisy Trey Stein JW Lucas the men in stripes and the season is underway poopy Miller reter sophomore from Chicago running the point transfer from Central Michigan Carr being hounded by Michael heres Sol who played two years for Mark F at Gonzaga Miller with a shot clock at five Salis Ryon fire good defensive possession for Elon that time Wake Forest got to get some flexibility a little better ball movement on the first possession but youre going to enjoy watching Miller number zero Elon is really young but they have a fifth year transfer point guard number 10 Rob Higgins McKinnon thats going to be the matchup tonight youre going to have Force against athleticism the athleticism comes from McKinnon and 65 66 to transfer to make some plays and then again youve got my guys childr whos just tough hes he just tough hildr average double digits a year ago third year for Steve fores you look for hild to score a little bit more this year than he did in the past Solace missed McKinnon rebounds and out to Rob Higgins year senior playing in his 94th Collegiate game Elon wants to be a patient team great ball move theyve got a wonderful guard and hiin that can make some solid plays and there he is he averaged 11 points a game in each of his four years at St Francis Brooklyn one thing you talk about this team and you talk about this guy transfer from St Fran hes a leader a tough guy that can get out in defend not going to score very much thats a positive play to get to the inside basket Miller on the take the turn around and the rebound by Kendall Campbell The Freshman from Atlanta two solid possessions for the Phoenix Campbell sets a screen for McKinnon McKinnon 15footer hes got two great looks hes got length at 65 66 Fs got to do a better job in coming up and closing him out and contesting on those jump shots he can make that shot from the midrange all night long preseason second team CAA Conference rookie of the year a season ago Marsh wake is 0 for four a shooting the start the night Elon is three for three W for us a season AG go as a team that shot a shade under 45 which was 12th best excuse me 46 which was fifth best in AAC but theyve got to get better shot selection that was a rush shot by Marsh here we go first turnover of the night for Elon a year ago they gave it away about 12 and a half times the contest look at this lineup You got a couple of guys that obviously first time theyve touched the floor as a demon Deacon sales and Miller Miller very good quickness sees the four Wales he got to get his get his legs together Miller lobs it for marsh kick out the corner and the three missed out there by Wake Forest who has started 0 for five Higgins had it blocked opportunity in transition Miller right to the hoop thats what you could expect to see out of Miller push the ball in transition and finish strong Miller broke his ankle after four games last year at Central Michigan all freshman team two years ago Applause McKinnon elri clears the board tilting the court down hill Hil in the lane cant score but he was Applause fouled Billy Taylor in his second year as the head coach of Elon they lost their first 19 division one games the year ago and then rally they won six out of eight late January early February hes a veteran Belmont Abby Ball State Le High Taylor is a veteran solid coach I first met him when he was in assistant with FR mcaf UNC Greensboro about 15 18 years ago played at Notre Dames a solid guy and and he going to build some things as you mentioned lost what first 14 15 games a season too and did just kind of settled things down end the season with eight wins theyre going to be a force in the ca this season Phoenix went 8 and 24 a year ago 6 and 12 in Le theyve started today three out of five from the floor much deeper this year McKinnon the three Tron hes got seven hes three of four from the floor he three outstanding looks at the basket two in the midrange one deep w got to do a better job of crowding here one thing about this Elon team also not really that big relatively speaking the W Forest but theyve got a lot more depth this season Salis created some space and hit from the elbow first basket as a demon Deacon for Salis many more to come a good athlete can score versati ways highly touted recruit but didnt play it ton at Gonzaga a three for Simpkins Off the Mark HRI controls the rebound HRI pushes HR spins HRI cannot finish but he was fouled Elon off to a hot shooting start four a six from the floor and one one from three 95 Phoenix earin theres Steve Forbes in his fourth year hes won everywhere at buron Community College at Northwest Florida State and Big Time at East Tennessee State 50 and 40 at wake he thinks this might be his best team Stan well theyve got depth theyve got great size and theres a basically a very young basketball team a lot of new ingredients I think they Wake Forest is right on the move but they did should have W should have gone the ncaas last year felt like they should have the last two years maybe didnt win the right games I feel like this season is going to be crucial for Wake for will continue to evolve season play theyve gone 31 and5 here at the Joel the last two years backto back 10 win ACC seasons for the first time since 1995 through 1997 back in the day if you 10 and 10 and won most your games at home in the ACC that got you postseason play a new day in basketball DeAndre smart hands off McKinnon right back to smart scores at The Rim sms a young physical guy for this Eline basketball team not very big only about 6667 but very physical at 230 pounds he play a lot last year he gives him quality minutes also in the game for Elon youve got a guy you better keep your eye on and that being Zack Andrew car goes to work and he cant score but will shoot free throws nice job on the glass after the timeout out rebounding weight six to three but this time dribble penetration and getting a very high percentage shot for a very young player that I think elons going to like this year not going to take a lot of jump shots Dave but its going to grind inside nice little give and go action get you score Carter shot 77 at the line last year this is game number 83 for the senior from Westchester Pennsylvania a transfer from Delaware talk about the depth and the size of Wake Forest one big goes out Matthew marame you got you got lone that can run lets see how the match Music up smart unable to hit in tight wake pulls the rebound Carr backing his way in Carr turns fires and an offensive foul he hooked him nice job in the post I like the little crab dribble got a little over aggressive with the left arm watch this does a good job got the high Advantage get there get there you see the arm just bow out just a little bit might not have called it this early in the season myself but hey what can I say offive fou a steal by Frederickson The Freshman leads the break Salis fires frerick and dexon gets inside Scoops it up and end to tie the game known as a perimeter shooter knocks down his first basket as a demon Deacon in the Applause paint theyre going to give the time out to the Phoenix Frederickson Stan a freshman from Oklahoma you see the move here highly recruited player who really is known for threes won the ThreePoint Contest at the curry Camp won the ThreePoint Contest at the final four number two player in the state of Oklahoma scored over 2000 High School points frericks in is one of several freshmen that were expecting to see action today this as you mentioned is a deep Wake Forest lineup and so you you know look at some different combinations got a couple of guys that are yet to play you know sitting out do to injury and whatnot so what I liked early about this theyve got size and they know how to use that size Zack Irving who one time was recruited by Steve Forbes to ETSU off the inbound Frederickson this is where you like having a guy like Salis in a game off the hildr Miss Elon can run Simkins duck under and scores we talked about the athleticism of Wake Forest will elons got a little bit of the same got a guy like simpin who can get to the basketball Zack G we just mentioned a moment ago can knock down threes and keep your eye on 22 La Pratt pild to the bucket Second Chance wont fall and Elon trying to clear the rebound Irvin battling and he does get it out to Simkins ahead to McKinnon for three second opportunity Harold a three for Applause irin thats what he does trying to tell you shooter roll to up the lead to 1911 Irvings got a pair of Threes its an eight nothing Run for the Phoenix Zack Irving missed partner all of the 2021 season and so he came in having ACL hes knocked down a lot of Threes in his career this is in transition this is mckinon now he can shoot the ball but the second chance opportunity not give it up on the play and you find a wide openen shooter at the top of the half Shooters roll like that Dave you see that little Back Spin on that bam knocks it in and heres what I heres what 1245 lots of time you go I like the spring in in Elon I like the fact that wake for is trying to take advantage of their size can they wear Elon down those shots arent going to always fall but if Im Billy Taylor Ive got to be ecstatic of the way my team has come out and been competitive in his first five or six minutes of this ball game you mentioned Billy Taylor coach for Fran mcaffrey on two different occasions HRI goes inside ceiling but unable to put it away is Keller and another chance for Elon and they knock it home again TK Simpkins the sophomore from Brooklyn this is a team that knocked down eight or more threepoint baskets 12 different times this past season including 10 against Monmouth and 10 against Indiana so theyre not afraid of the big lights Elon is four of five on threes wake is yet to hit one H the midrange K bu had a phenomenal scoring night or afternoon I should say against Alabama last Sunday not this time for Simpkins Wake Forest trailing by nine early Elon hot from the outside 336th in the country shut 30 from Three Billy Taylor said if they can touch the paint more tonight they can get more open threes so far so good very impressed not only with the shot selection the fact of 15 but keep this in mind too heres why I say you got to be excited if youre really Taylor Elon theyre out rebounding weight by four and theyve getting a great contribution From the Bench outscoring the Demon Deacons at this point 132 Miller rubs off the screen goes to Carr Sanka the transfer from UCLA lost it Steel by Zack Irvin Campbell was foul oh no goal tender count the bucket nice recognition throw it over the top Campbell able to finish it take a look there helps side comes just a little late just a step late you see his hand was on the rim as well as the block block might have been good touch the rim Elon on a 132 Music run really nice job taking L for out of the smooth flow offensively Miller Lost going up Campbell Outlets to Higgins Higgins into the corner for Hull and he walked or stepped on the sideline Nick Dorne replaces Hull for Elon Dorne The Freshman from Charlotte who comes from an incredibly athletic family dad and brother in the NFL another brother played High one high T1 Music basketball was at one time obviously everybody this neck of the woods knows the name t but now young Mr Nichols we see what he can do open three no good for Tonka itll stay Applause here zanka is a sophomore from Italy who played 22 games at UCLA last year Steve Forbes recruited him out of high school and thinks he can be a Difference Maker how he and Salis get get along in practice you see Gaga match ups the last couple of years I be interesting to watch practice a little closer with the steal a three on two Irvin yes sir you know they did a nice job but you cant go for the fakeer hes got his feet set thats one of his spots hes an excellent Wing shooter in addition to being at top of the key Zack hers been in Rhythm knock down three threes three for three for Zack Irvin and the lead has ballooned to 14 for the Phoenix and hilra threw it into the second round elons doing a great job of reacting theyre moving down every pass theyre taking off driving Lanes making weight for us kind of have to think about everything theyre doing that time just miscommunication and that happens a lot this time of year trying to run things you got different combinations Ws got to tighten up from the defensive end too many easy looks elons last against an ACC opponent all the way back to 2005 as Campbell trains the three kendle Campbell 68 freshman look what I got 2005 the Phoenix beat CL in 74 69 Mill another turnover thats the fifth for Wake Forest you got guards you just said it a moment ago taking for us out of their Rhythm but theyre also as quick and in some cases maybe even quicker than what you SE on the first step of wake Bary wake got to adjust that how to get the basketball to different players in the four look at again we talk about it so much spacing great spacing good ball movement and jump shots by big guys its not a good way but theyll take that K looking to snap an eight nothing run instead he gives it away great hustle elons bench calling for a Time out but a held ball Elon has the arrow thatll be turnover seven Stan well thats yeah I mean no rhythm offensively and great aggression the ball was loose what happens you see two Elon players diving after loose ball Elon has outscored Wake Forest 192 over the last Almost five minutes good look for Simpkins and he hits from the elbow got big guys that are stepping out and setting screens and if you dont respect the screen you kick back if the guards are able to turn the corner and go downhill they have a great ability to pull up and make the 12 to 15 foot jump shot and you seeing this big lead by the fight fingers now McKinnon after a long rest gets back on the court seven points and seven minutes this is one of the things that the staff was concerned about who going to be the other scores as yet another turnover by the Demon Deacons the deakes have more turnovers than they do field goals made they were a good thing and if it was colder you know what Ill tell you right you dont want to have more turnovers than is a temperature fortunately we thats the war spell lately this all works on the defensive side for R Force Campbell rebounded by Miller Miller thats good thats a good decision by Miller push the basketball make them stop you and make them stop the ball we dont stop the ball get to your comfort area which is right there in the paint and youre able to score a needed basket by the de def snapped a run of almost three minutes that wake did not score turnover by McKinnon H dri and transition hel hero into the lane shot was blocked under control jump stop on two feet finish there Andre Applause Carr Simpkins in the lane for Applause Campbell Elon off to a red hot start six of nine for three and in control early break they put a heating pad on him looks to be okay heres the play hard fall right there comes over little lead kind of bumps into a player Campell land hard cars a long young man0 hopefully he can come back this is wake a little bit shorthanded Fon Reed is still waiting on his waiver from the NCAA L PL here to Marsh broken up and Elon looking for more eighth turnover by the Demon Deacons Nick Dorne forces his way in and well get to the line start to be start looking at some Trends and you get concerned about some things at this point right now Elon 14 of 22 wake five of 17 wake 0 seven from three and we both have talked about wakes ability to be able to knock down threes but the thing that would concern me more than anything right now are two things Elin out rebounding by three and Elon has seven assists on four turnovers Wake Forest no assist as I mentioned a moment ago 17 its a long game its a long game s in you settle in and and you got to get a couple stops if youre wake and if youre Elon continue to keep pressure on the basketball and take them out of their comfort zone in the ex against Alabama W Trail 5239 at half time and 1888 Al gets to the cup if they didnt have quite as many turnovers and they really made Alabama uncomfortable in the second half of that game taking away shots contesting shots and been able to push the ball in transition Simpkins goes on the Baseline for McKinnon car is set to come back in and at this whistle will reenter so thats good news because Qui Forest is already without Reed waiting on that waiver Monsanto still reaing the injury from last year and jawi TOA is out with a knee injury much better job defensively taking far as he comes back in the ball game and that matchup is concerning me I think in coach Forbes as well whos going to guard McKinnon that time again you had hild going he took away that that spin move to get to the middle of the floor forced to turnover Music kth nine points for cam HRI to lead all scorers every team has to have a guy thats not afraid to go in there and do the Dirty Work It doesnt matter what size you are or what position you play cam hildr is that guy he scores a lot of points in the paint drives inside makes the midrange and take a charge and the more I guarantee you this the more active hildr can become offensively as well as defensively the better chance wake has put in this deficit and eventually win his game irin awkward shot got it to go f did a nice job of contesting taking away the the lift just a good shot by a guy that can score the basketball with Zack Iran hes got 11 on four of four a shooting grad student from Gate City Virginia hes been known to be a streaky shooter nice step through by Andrew Carr back into the game and delivers you know maybe being of that tumble a moment ago Nick dor seven of 10 for threes for Elon last year they were one of the worst threepoint shooting teams in the country yeah but uh like I we said you know thats thats a that gagee they played against some teams that didnt give them some looks that theyre getting away thats what we wanted to see if youre a Wake Forest answer from Parker Fredericks in his first career three oh back cut yep McKinnon caught it from irin and laid it in last year Elon averaged 65 points a game theyve got 43 and still five to go in the half nice spin move in the bucket by Salis and because you dont have a a definite post inside you can take the ball here but thats going to tear you up coach Forbes is not going to like that you score a basket one in and push it right down three dribbles and get another layup Elon doing a great job in half court and full court basketball la Pratt with the answer and right back down the floor Salis two more right now you dont want to get into a running game with Elon simply for the fact theyre able to score youre getting to high percentage shots Dorne left it dramatically short and now Frederickson for the veteran point guard hildr step through and the foul you go you need a basket find an opening H not afraid to go inside look crossover gets contact and able to finish the play expect the contact make the officials blow the whistle but you finish the play an easy call gets there and Bam right back in it yeah I like it I saw you I like it too lets see now with a couple paint baskets for Wake Forest see what adjustments offensively and what I mean is I thought on the first pass lets dont worry about taking so many jump shots early in the offense for Elon see how they kind of slowed him down nurture this thing to the half what happens in this Applause possession better ball pressure right now by we double team on Dorne gets out of it and he got fouled wake staff wanted to travel theyve cut a 21o deficit down to 14 some air purifiers can lose Performance Mission game against Alabama all of the proceeds for the game went to to The Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist comprehensive stroke center and thats because Steve Forbes the head coach of Wake Forest his wife Janetta suffered a stroke early in August she spent 42 days in the hospital a a tremendous cause shes doing much much better stand but Wake Forest Baptist comprehensive stroke center they do so much important work you know what he was given a statistic about you know maybe over 20000 people every day or have a stroke or affected by a stroke his wife is on the road to recover its a slow process but shes there she was in attendance last week and maybe at the game tonight but uh a wonderful cause and we got to make sure you take care of that she gets better soon Salis knocks on the three it was once a 21o deficit now down to 13 youve taken away Elon easier looks you force her offense out a little bit so theres a double team right there you got to get back theyve made Shooters put the ball irin getting into the paint Fall Away falls Applause out another good possession there you take your time if you waake run your sets inside outside get a shot Applause Maran DAV here Billy Taylor crew you want to continue to be aggressive but you want to continue to be aggressive in a Smart Way get some good shots thats a good shot thrs it rub screen action and find your spot and again Higgins only averag about 12 points in ball game in St Francis really wasnt look to be a big score but a facilitator of the basketball but he could make some shots and and that was a big one coming out of the timeout and afterwe made a basket Salis hits again second three 12 points for Salis in his Wake Forest debut hes got a different level of basketball well talk about his basketball IQ his ability to make plays and understanding the game youre going to enjoy watching Sal Dorne a deep one yes sir wow DOR hit a couple of Threes hes got 10 in his first college game Im telling you I mean a freshman with some confidence on the road not hesitant to knock down the jum Billy Taylor thought he was much deeper this year and could play more the way he wanted to three for HRI and keep in mind for Sam Shi 16 post guys sitting out right now coming off an injury so again that gives him more size little more length and extra more depth nice to get into a little bit of offensive theyre hoping to have Sher back Thursday night against East Tennessee State Irvin misses the three and a foul on the rebound when Elon faces ETSU thats ETSU led by BP Savage who was an assistant here at wake last year youve seen Irving take that shot throughout his career its not as bad a shot as made look going up there because he is deep knockdown shooter might have been a little quick in the set this a guy thats made 157 threes in his fouryear career at Elon so again thats what he does it was a good look maybe not the best shot but it was a decent look hell get better he take him out there took him out for defensive purpose the r again elons the team that theyre hot right now can wait for us cre him off this final 11 wake started five of 17 theyve hit 10 of their last 11 make it 11 for 12 another deep one the ability to score off the bounce to create your own offense thats what Hunter Sal is giving him right now better defensive intensity Again by the defense Rob Higgins has a bigger defender on him gives it up to Dorne Dorne proing fires a three dor again it was a big time score Chambers high school over in Charlotte I think he thinks hes playing against West Charlotte or west Meck somebody right now he is he is hot hes got 13 in the first half three for four from distance they can play for the final shot this is the track meet that Billy Taylor had hoped for last year suited up only eight healthy guys much of the Year wants to be deep wants to play up and down the court game right now Higgins with four Higgins with two Higgins in the lane blocked at The Rim Elon goes to the locker room up real against a lot of teams hes showing that ability right now against Elon what will W do different defensively better defense put pressure on the basketball take away back Cuts as soon as I say that for late but you think about this now and as an interesting question McKenna got off to a really nice start but he ended the he ended the first half you know with nine points didnt really get a lot of looks other guys took up the slack and scored the basketball Irvin comes in makes some baskets so does dorm so youve got to just be a better team defensively Higgins the veteran at the line each of his four years at St Francis Brooklyn he averaged between 11 and 12 points a game well hes a very solid player and thats one of the things the Elon staff so excited about having him he brings stability hes a smart guy a senior plus that thats stable not going to make a lot of mistakes scores when the opportunity has gives you really good defense and a good ball handler and leader Elon is one of the youngest teams in the country average age 199 but its the veteran point guard they brought in out of the portal to kind of keep everyone in Music Rhythm second chance for weake after solace missed the three Music car Music hildr its going to stay here a third shot on this possession coming up for Wake Forest and wake uses some of that size out rebounded by one at the half 11 defensive rebounds only two offensive rebounds for the Demon Deacons that time a second chance opportunity for Carr probably should have taken that shot kicked it out of selfishly but he able to get a rebound another chance and they score off down good pass by Frederickson HRI a corner three and its down to nine Elon LED 3615 with about seven to go in the first half hins confidently from the elbow yeah that ball action that pick and roll action has been a big success for Elon tonight W has got to do a better job stopping the basketball containing getting closer and then contesting those shots nice pass to Carr good job by Matthew Marsh very unselfish and continue to move without the basketball as the big fella Applause car Doren tough J little bump there for H threw him off stride Salis on the Applause go Higgins trying to draw a foul couldnt three onone Wake Forest hildr fakes the pass cant score but the bucket will count begin to see the length the size and even the athleticism of those bigs for Wake Forest beginning to give Elon a little trouble drive inside gets a shot contested Rus driving there goes in there too many arms too many hands there no foul there and then a great move by hildr thats an easy call basket McKinnon the leaner theyll shoot two you know thats thats a pro hes got the hes got the Australian experience of playing but he understands how to how to play as you take a look we mentioned earlier Rookie of the Year played in the NBL in Australia at a very young age and you could tell it with that move because see how the hesitation how his ability to draw the foul to slow down the tempo of what w fors thats just thats just a big time again two gold midds a team under 20 two gold midds under 20 years old its a nice career then you become the ca rookie of the year so the last four or five years Mr McKinnon has been very very special only a soft he was a late s for Billy Taylor and its because of a veteran coaching staff everyone on the staff has head coaching experience they had ties to Australia zackin checks back in go Elon trying to decide yeah a little half court pressure just to slow the Rhythm just W for our team but they wont have a problem good ball handlers hildr also Miller HRI was held the ball AC hit Salis away from the ball running on the Baseline opportunity to go high post and eventually look for the back door if it have been Music available Applause Miller I said quickness that we used to see from the point guard the last couple years having a guy like apple be a season ago think about how many times he just BW by people and got to the rim irin shot clock at 10 for McKinnon better possession defensively by W Forest Campbell spins fires cant get it to Applause go trying to slice into a sixpoint deficit solos the fade just knows out of play Billy Taylor trying to wait for the under 16 time out tells his team to slow down were going to play through this weve got good ball hand on the floor make the right decision with the shot be Kinnon cant answer Applause Miller elons going to bring three Subs into the game smart and Simpkins and Pratt wake Trail by 21 with seven minutes to go in the first half Miller Applause Simpkins has it blocked another chance at it smart not a great leaper didnt have the length didnt have the size Advantage nice job of keeping your position defensively by the big Carr and the foul its a twopoint Music game wait for it demon Deacon taking in wak Elon on opening night they saw Elon race out to a 21o lead but a strong start to the second half for Wake Forest 15 to5 and in this second half everything has kind of come together stany I mean you know just playing better defense youre not as hot shooting the ball in the first half second half as you were first by Elon and wait for us some that side was that his mom was that the marfield brothers mom I believe that was yeah I think kiss yeah a good season didnt no doubt second half weting a seven to 12 shooting Elon is one for seven better defense wield the play he good job there moving your feet forcing him out of the shooting areas did not let back comfortable in the reverse and an offensive foul on hickin just great job defensively by Wake Forest and watch this everything not able to reverse the basketball get great position defensively Higgins a veteran point guard tried to fight through it himself couldnt get that now chance to take the lead by the Demon Deacons Wake Forest has not LED tonight Miller penetrates pitches Music Salis thought about it back to Miller looking to tie the game shot clock at five Salas the two to tie it and Salis with the foul tell you what head Jumper by Salis didnt go in obviously but it really looked he really elevates at 65 hes going to be a matchup problem for smaller guards and a lot of bigs they arent going to be able to guard him 18 20 feet away from the basket Simpkins circling lost see Elon which depended so much on the perimeter shot and a lot of times they were getting those shots because they would penetrate kick it out being unselfish theyre trying to go inside they dont have have the lint they dont have the size to go in and battle against you know the marshes and the cars of the world Hildreth on the go he gives weight their first lead tonight just took the ball strong got into pain about 12T away Elevate scores Applause lead really engaged with Irving not letting him catch the ball or even he does get his feet set this is a good battle in the Baseline shot cluck rarely got to this stage in the first half La Pratt unable to hit Maran pulls the board another strong young player for w Forest going to give you some good moments mar mar Miller the transfer from Central Michigan uses the screen misses the three Simkins bobbled it kicked it out Pratt for Applause three hild D ahead to Applause Music Maran they C on the Flor motion to shoot think its going to be on the Music floor hrth Music open Music shot clock at 10 HR the fade miss the Applause three second chance and one for Andrew Carr something we did not see at all in the first half the second chance opportunities so far Wake Forest doing a great job and dominating the inside using the side watch this long rebound take your time big fell back him in go up strong get the contact and now the possibility of the threepoint Music play talk about somebody thats going to be an extended score car averag about 11 points the ball game last year look for those numbers to go up because he can run the floor he has the ability to make the midrange jump shot and can finish strong that was a nice play there to his lead for Wake Forest no major foul trouble in this game that foul on zanka but no ones got more than two and in fact the only player in the game with two smart for Elon and Carr for Wake Forest you got to be a very solid possession if youre Elon withinn back in the ball game and turns the corner over the back on Kendall Campbell in the bonus already Stan yeah well McKinnons got the length get in there make just a little stronger shot recreate some contact just kind of flip that up and and so now two things have happened one wake has extended defense put more pressure started control the glass what we expected him to do Elon is struggled Elon is not getting in fluid offense Ws done a good job turning it up and whats also happened something very interesting elons lost a little bit of confidence that they had Elon had 55 points in the first half they have five in the first eight minutes of the second half its not very good is it its not very good the first half was outstanding the game is 40 minutes unless it goes to over much better movement this time see if we can get a shot Simpkins gets free if you can move the basketball from side to side inside out you can move people and just be patient youll get a shot and a lot of times if you do those things well youll get a good shot they did that time Simpkins came over to jar the ball out of the hands of car but hes called for a foul Wake Forest has come from behind to take the lead 6662 11 and a half to play theres never been a better time to Wake Forest is N9 of 17 shooting while Elon has gone two of 11 the game is completely turns down yeah you remember Midway in the first half talking about Elon out rebounding Wake Forest by about three or four and Wake Forest had uh no no assists and seven turnovers another a 10minute mark since that time Wake Forest had seven assists and only eight turnovers and they started outrebounding Elon Now by a plus five you outrebound the team you forced him into some bad shots youre able to cut into the lead and then if you execute your offense you can take the lead lead youre doing that now by going to the free throw line where theyre 11 of 12 think 12 of 13 I love how I do that quick laugh in the head right there see how I did that quick need pencil or paper Im too sharp too early to Year Ill go down quick La Pratt distributes it to Harold havent heard much out of Irving in this half havent heard anything out of McKinnon those two guys got to find a way to score they not going to beat them off the bounce too many times Pratt scores off the window I like Pratts atth this remember we were talking before the ball game I was telling you about a guy to keep your eye on is Bratt just a really good athlete that can make plays runs the floor real well slow to get up for Wake for a Salis Bratt 6 five k out of Columbus Ohio but yeah Sals kind of little bumped into somebody limping a little bit on that left leg leg under the basket hes tough hell stay in there Maha hes Music tough Salis with a shot clock at five freshman Isaac derell 12 in the game for uh Elon gives him a little more athleticism young kid got some Applause length t love to see a basket right now on his team pratts three a little bit of a line drive HTH with the Applause rebound Andrew carrr with the shot clock at eight the double team comes and had it knocked away McKinnon leads the break iring for Music three hit off the shoulder of mckinon Wake Forest Scoops it out Salis in transition Salis attacks and hes fouled great hustle for the loose ball by for us you kind of thought Elon was going to be able to make a basket that time had a nice look by Irving in that scramble youre able to get the rebound push the ball out and get a basket Salis was such a highly regarded recruit he went to kaga the first five star ever from the state of Nebraska Steve Forbes thinks that he can be really special and we know that Forbes has brought in One impact transfer after another well last couple of years just look at it I mean last year you know and was Kid the year before that so you just keep bringing great athletes to make plays but they are really excited about Sal still kind of you know from AIS Williams played man he came on and just dominated the ACC obviously ACC played a year and and Jake laravia is coming in with Memphis I think hes still with Memphis first round I thought I thought I saw him in the preseason game and Tyre ABY last year just just a blur have that same success this time foris Sixpoint deficit shot clock at eight possession for Elon got nope in Applause look well they get a second good opportunity Nick DOR McKinnon with a shot clock at 10 spins fires and W wave off the basket that they have gotten away a little bit of a earli in that possession just not in any type of Rhythm contesting shots early in the game werent contesting those shots he a got some good looks lately hes been really struggling to get shots not on balance hes a good shooter hes got to find a way to get on number quickly Frederickson replaces zanka for Wake Music Forest there is Frederickson The Freshman inside touch and a nice scoop by Andrew Carr yeah they they can get that most anytime they want it theyll be patient get the ball a car did a nice job keeping it up and strong just too big and too strong against the Young Richford 18 for Carr a steal by Miller off to the RAC as the layup is good the lead is 10 Billy Taylor needs a time Applause out defense leads the offense Miller to the rack a 21point deficit is turned into a 10point advantage offense in the first half was just fine their defense struggled a bit in the second half it has been terrific offensively for weake cam HRI has nine of his career high 24 since halftime and the defense is stiffened Sam defense is stiffen they getting rebounds and also something that you cannot Overlook 42 20 points in the paint for WG Forest theyve done what you kind of thought they were going to do just took them a few minutes to get the memo go inside get rebound bounds pound pound Pound and when they do that good things can happen what does Billy Taylors team need here they need a shot they need a good Rhythm offensive shot from McKinnon or this guy Zack ir and a chance for four scary sometime a Im scary sometime a you were a coach yeah but a long time ago I mean obviously I didnt do a good job Im sit over here with you but you know but look at this watch this screen after the timeout little elevator screen down up gets a shooter Rhythm first time hes had a really good look in a long time and again hes a great catch and shoot performer dont give him a lot of time he catches boom gets rid of it the left arm is a trick hes got a little injury left shoulder but its his right shoulder that you better worry about and that is a momentum changer big basket for Elon Irvins got 15 and the Wake lead is down to two possessions Carr and one aggressive tough play in the pain its just a its a very unfair matchup right now just going inside the Big Fellas just Tak it over inside and score W fars continues to extend this lead theres never been a better time to get away jumper little ha he gets the bass explodes here using the left hand watch the physicality right there and then Elevate finding the spot about 10 ft in and then going inside hanging in the air getting some contact and playing through it cam Hilder 24 points tonight his career high at 23 last year against Florida State but what hes done is hes scored a lot of ways hes been physical with that and when Wake Forest needed a basket in the pain cam hildr is the one that got it started I talked to Steve Forbes before the game I said if its close late do you know who youre going to run the play for and he said Hildreth but hunter Salis and Andrew Carr all really good options the TR have six 63 points on 22 of 35 shooting see thats the coach talking to TV guy that dont know any better you know goone well hes going to get the ball in hilders hand let him make a play and you saw why because hes physical hes not afraid he can make a play thats a good thats a good coaches answer the TV people know because well tell that kind of stuff see people watch these games in Scout but you know I know get the H get out of his way hes going to create something you saw that thats a good answer I liked it for early in the season you dont know you dont know whos going to have a good game whos going to have a bad game you got to have options you do you knew H rther was going to have a big game tonight did yes is he gonna have a big game at George on Friday probably so HRI the fade you know why you know why you know why why yeah seriously you know why why because hes aggressive he gets to the basket he takes contact and hes not afraid to play defense so if youll do those things you can average anywhere from 12 to 18 points if youre a score how many you got a penil in for against Utah November 16th in Char I had got that far yet I hadnt seen Utah play but Utah is usually long in athletic youll get 10 to 12 14 we get you get you get two baskets in your half court offense you get a couple baskets you go to the free throw line you get a threepoint basket and you get something out of conversion look you scored you got 20 or 14 points yeah I mean you can do that thats thats his game henkins had it blocked here come the decks again in the corner Frederickson see that could have been a bad you know Fredericks good look he wanted to take that but to to further that point of how a guy like fck could score the basketball hes on the defensive end he Sprints down the other end he feels a lane they go to the other side take a jumper but if they miss it hes going to probably get his hands on to get a second chance opportunity Frederickson will fire and H and we just told told you earlier this guy is deadly one of the best threepoint Shooters coming out of high school in the nation he is not disappointed great footwork great finish TI follow through and St Elon needs a basket Ive said that before Elon has 13 points in the second half smart had it blocked and the dicks have it again smart 66 goes about 230 235 doesnt have the size or the length to go against gar at 610 in the second half Al de ER missed the long one second chance at it hriff on the take hell dun it what I tell you what I tell you he didnt tell me he was going to dunk didnt say nothing about dunk dunking wasnt in the equation it was about being able to score the ball takeing the basket head shoulder great footwork everybody mes at the dunk I footwork what did he do give head shoulder fake didnt travel put it to the floor and exploded to the basket yeah hes you won how how many points you for Utah how we give yeah how many I havent seen Utah right now I havent done any scouting in Utah I would say very easily easily 12 somewhere between 12 and 21 next home games Charleston Southern November 24th how many look word see that see that and didnt H he was under control everything he did was fundamentally sound head shoulder fake got the defender off watch it put it to the back head up and then he recognize oh youre not going to come up and contest Im taking this right to the hole and he left no doubt by finishing strong now what happens if he finishes strong he gets foul possibility of a 31 play another point Im just trying to tell you there are a lot of ways to score the basketball in the district to running the offense hes aggressive hes got a scores mentality but more importantly this is a new one for you first game first season head P out instead of having the scores mentality hes got a finisher in tal 26 points five rebounds five assist 10 of 15 shooting two of five from three you like that did you I did give it to me answer first game is early November how many he going to average this year I dont I I had I had really thought about dep how many shots he takes hes a high percentage shoo but I would dare say hell average more than 122 I mean you got remember he have 12 points that came last year but applebe scored so many ways you had Damen Williamson so you had guys that could score so a lot of the baskets scor last year A lot of times kind of went unnoticed where now hes going to be a lead scorer hes not a volume shooter he takes the care basketball I I very easily oh 12 is 12 is a giver fourar Prospect was the top recruit from the United Kingdom a few years ago heres Miller with a run out and Elon is just imploded and as happy as Billy Taylor his staff were in the first half they will not be happy with their execution their shot selection the ab to rebound and more than that theyre ball handling in the second half Elon is four of 19 shooting in the second half theyve been outrebounded 187 yeah one thing that has been impressive is the fact that theyve done a really good job and a lot of that most of that happened in the first half is a b theyve gone from up 21 to down 15 good close out that time getting in the shooting airace Irvin off balance got it to go hey he got Ill give you that he got thats a great basket by IR but its good defense he didnt get the jumper that he wanted did he and the shot he had to make he had to really work hard to get it Irvins got a team High 17 Elon was picked 10th of 14 in the CAA coming off a eight win campaign yeah that theyll theyll be a better team than that you know the ca is very tough see Wilmington you know college at Char oh c tough simp scores I mean we forc to be col Char in the week of Charleston UNCW Drexel and hofra picked a top the ca yeah yeah spacing understand time and score h d 28 might be one more coming RS and repeat gets in the paint good elevation physicality some guys you get bumped like like that theyre looking for the foul and they dont finish the play this guy says okay I in fact I encourage you to hit me because I know whats going to happen doesnt shy away from contact and you make your free throws so all those things I was telling you about if you go to the free throw line four times make your free throws you got 16 18 points b w Forest is 15 of 17 at the line tonight very impressive Isaac Harrell cant hit but a foul on the Applause rebound Elon will play ETSU Thursday and then head to North Dakota on Sunday theyre in an mte in Rock Hill where theyll play IUPUI Holy Cross and winthrip next weekend o pooy Music you know that tournament you talking about Utah Houstons in there tal tough tournament T its a very tough tournament but you we wor about Georgia this games not over but you know the talk Forest becomes wake beat last year 8171 Georgia went 16 and 16 last year Mike whites first season at the H tempo right now Miller slashing and scoring yeah Millers going to be a handful quick First Step tough player understands whats going home and the youth right now the experience in Elon really shows a lot of young guys on his court and and and Ill tell you something else that happened to them they played so hard with so much emotion in the first half that you know you got got pushed around a little bit just couldnt fight back you get you get fatigued first game though from Elon Im not disappointed Im disappointed they not going to win it but Im not disappointed with the effort that is is a deep one for Miller yeah hes got 15 thats his first three the eighth three of the night for Wake Forest and thats the deepest of the AG all the things that did not work well for Wake Forest and the first half are working in the second half one of the things that really worked for us was this hild head shoulder fake puts it to the floor jams and home watch this again in case you didnt miss it the first time theres never been a better with just over seven minutes to go in the first half Elon Le Wake Forest 3615 it has turned dramatically at halftime a 12point game and in the second half all Wake Forest the dees on their way to a one and0 start and thanks to shooting 58 in the second half well Elon is six of 23 from the floor the big game for cam HRI who has a career high 29 15 in the first half 14 in the second half and also you look at something that really is impressive to me is the fact that theyve out scored Eline 5224 points in the paint and cam hildr up there 29 Points you know hes only two of five from threepoint land you know hes been to the free throw line a couple times knocked those in I think five out of six but hes done a lot of that damage you saw that dunk weve shown a couple of times you know getting in the middle of the paint just throwing a little floater I mean that the ability at 64 65 to get inside and we talk about it a lot but it is something that you dont see out of every player but he understands his game if he can do that hes going to get some bigger C some shot blockers but what happens if youre able to get that inside kick it out to a shooter youre knocking it down that makes the offense even better little high ball screen actually little twins here so they get the high low out of this Frederickson Andrew Carr the block lead back Sim not sure how much contact it really was but car is eight of nine at the free throw line seven rebounds 20 points yeah yeah its a very its a very good line that ties his career high 22 nice touch at the free throw man you get your a big guy that can make free throws over 70 75 man hes got nice hands waai for teams going to be a tough out they got D Simkins fouled by Applause HR backto back 10 win ACC seasons for Steve forbess team backto back winning years for the first time since the dinoo era went to the quarterfinals of the ACC tournament last year for the first time since 2009 zkin no doubt about that TK Simpsons about to say took put up some nice numbers down at Northwest K from Brooklyn and again something that Elon did not have a lot of last year you take a look at Simkins just great elevation there boom good job by the Freshman not to foul him but uh they theyve got a little more depth and and I tell you something else theyve got just to that depth theyve got some athleticism they got some guys can float around the rim didnt see a lot of it necessarily as far as dunks but you know the Nick dor in the world you know did not play much of Jon M Michael didnt play him a lot tonight and was Siris not playing right now I tell you what right now Billy Taylor Billy Taylors got to feel good about his team continuing to get better and better Simkins went to Northwest Florida State of course Steve Forbes coached there went 62 and six in two years heres hriff Euro aggressive Music mental Simkins Applause foul you look in the I guess papers people still look at the paper dont you you see people look at the newspaper are you just get it off the phone now all the school is that what people do I dont know I I try to look at the paper myself maybe not as much as I used to but I still look in paper people look at the paper tomorrow and theyre going to see this score and they say oh wow weight just blew their doors they dont understand they had to work for this game they had to work very hard to get this W you look at the paper you look everything on the
