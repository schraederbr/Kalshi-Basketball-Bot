Music a raucous atmosphere here in Chapel Hill for a huge late season game and we are set for basketball Pete Nance will jump center for the Tar Heels against Jayden Gardner for the Cavaliers Music Carolina with a basketball first in the hands of RJ Davis the Junior from Archbishop Stephen act High School in White Plains New York Applause is here on this end of the floor primarily what how do you defend Armando baycott when he gets to basketball in his hands do you double team or do you allow him to play oneonone there he is one on one short on the turnaround being defended by Ben vanderplas Doug we have to mention the first time these two teams got together this year Armando baycott only played a minute and a half in that game here are tonights starting lineups brought to you by degree no surprises for UVA perhaps well see more of a couple of the reserve bigs Kaden Shedrick Francisco caporo depending on matchups Franklin is denied at the rim and here comes UNC five on four leaky black no look pass to Nance from the corner he was so good on Wednesday early at Notre Dame they need production from him and leaky black is so good defensively all season long comes up with the blocked shot and starts the break Franklin gives it back to Gardner working on Armando Baker now back out front under 10 to shoot DJ Clark feeds the post to Gardner Clark gonna have to put it up and it is a double dribble before the shot a Huber Davis was right on top of that in Jamie Luckys ear calling out the double dribble on Kia Clark both of Virginias possessions have gone late into the shot clock of course the whos a comfortable playing from there but right now North Carolina putting on the pressure defensively North Carolina having lost five of its last seven his team that of course made it all the way to the championship game in the NCAA tournament last spring here goes bacon who is so good in those six games as it knocked out of bounds and he was the last to touch itll be Virginia basketball Thats Tony Bennett in year 14 as the head coach at Virginia Applause great talk with TB pregame and him talking about wanting to see how his team responds here of course in what will be a very hostile environment against a good North Carolina team Gardner is so good at the midrange hes got uvas first two points of the night and he scored a third of Virginias points on Wednesday night 16 of the 48 he was the only one who really could get anything going offensively 50 percent for Jayden Gardner with the rest of the team shooting 30 on the game Applause Caleb love Applause fans counting down the shot clock as love Banks it home its a little late on Saturday for banking hours to be open however here in the dean Dome Im sure that deposit will be accepted quickly at the other end third and fourth points for Jaden Gardner Applause love uses two screens sees a little daylight off the front rim he was looking for a foul as Beekman closed down Applause on the switch give it inside Gartner well he operates so nicely around the basket he really does and for Virginia to be successful Jayden Gardner really has to be their guy especially on the interior that they can go to hes that third leading scorer in conference play but hes picked up his offense as of late as you see all six Virginia points so far tonight Applause Davis going to work on Kihei Clark all the way to the basket and that shows you the quickest of RJ Davis not something you see often people beating Kihei Clark off the bounce but RJ Davis is up to the task offensively foreign ER floss around and out Davis clears the rebound for UNC Applause David snow baker has it knocked away Tracked Down in the corner by Beekman hey great Hands by Reese Beekman getting in crashing on Armando bacon even though he came up with the basketball not allowing him to gather the offensive board heres Clark averaging about 11 and a half points per game second in the ACC at nearly six assists per game me and Beekman usually do such a good job Distributing and taking care of the basketball Applause thought about it now working on Nance tough shot able to make it in the lane one of the areas of concern for Tony Bennett was making sure that his guards were able to get into the painted area and attack once they do not going in looking to pass but look to score Applause down the deck cut off by Gardner now he tries to back his way in Applause Music Davis looks down checks his feet and buries it after a couple of slow games offensively RJ Davis off to a quick start tonight and right now the pace of this game favors North Carolina Virginia does not want to play the uptempo game however Jayden Gardner with eight points already doesnt mind the base how does he find himself so open in the midrange so frequently Corey because Kihei Clark touched the paint when he gets into the paint the defense has to contract allowing Jane Gardner to have those easy looks Applause the post paycock brings it back out to love short on the three ball cleared by Gardner but a good look for Caleb love on that one and those are the shots you want to see Caleb love taking off of inside out action Applause Arman Franklin the former Indiana Hoosier misfires and back and forth we go here comes the double team with vanderplas how can Carolina make them pay good recovery by Gardner to get back out defensively to Nance Nancy Dougie fresh all about baycott only played a minute and a half in that game Pete Nash did not play so Virginia is facing a different team than they saw before Clark slow to get back up hes trailing the play Davis lost the basketball and now Virginias defense able to set up Caleb loves slices right through it smart play by Caleb love recognizing Bennett vandepos has zero chance of keeping him out of the painted area not settling and going to the rim no Applause Nance well we wondered about the enthusiasm of this North Carolina team they have shown it early here tonight a 70 run for the Tar Heels Saturday afternoon basketball in Chapel Hill is always going to be rocking and right now Pete Nash feeling himself knocking down a huge three for the heels Applause ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is brought to you by Wendys two for six dollars the best deal in fast food have an entertaining one here but the Tar Heels on a roll with an eightpoint edge urgency is a word that applies to both teams coming into this matchup and is valid for different reasons obviously for Virginia theyre still in their quest to get a regular season title and for the Tar Heels their backs are against the wall they wanted to improve off that second half performance against Notre Dame if we were at that shoot around these are a couple of words that stood out to me from coach Huber Davis he said sharpness we have to make sure we focus and communication there was a different energy to this team knowing their backs were against the wall to close but also because they remember their first meeting with UVA you mentioned it Corey Armando baycott and Pete Nance werent available back in January theyre both coming into this game after a double double Pete Nan said I had to find my guy on the inside how important is it that they established that connection at this point in the season Corey its extremely important Angel because it opens up the spacing on the floor and then ask knocking down threepointers only helps Armando get going on the offense today Gardner first time hes missed here tonight into the ball game Jalen Washington who has had a hard time getting on the floor in recent minutes last three games has played only three minutes Seth Trimble has also come in for Carolina he feeds it to Washington and along those lines what Angel was saying is Washington turns it over no surprise Beekman with a steal able to get a good look but couldnt find it Washington the rebound Applause whats up Welcome to our Sonic Blockbuster matchup in Chapel Hill North Carolina the Tar Heels and Virginia Cavaliers in a key late season ACC Showdown and after shooting only 33 percent worst of the year in their win Wednesday at Notre Dame Corey North Carolina has come out shot the lights out they made only two threes against the iris theyve already got four to build this league well and one of the things theyve been able to do is establish Pete Nance on the perimeter taking some of the pressure off of almondo bacon but theyve got contribution from a number of different guys to start this game off and of course Pete Nance did not play in the first matchup between these two teams and of course Armando bake out only a minute and a half in that game so they say different North Carolina team that Virginia is playing against here this evening Corey Alexander Ive done well and a lot is expected of this matchup this is a big game between two big Brands both though playing with desperation here tonight absolutely this is the desperation Bowl Virginia after their performance at Boston College on Wednesday Tony Bennett not happy with this team flat out disappointed in the effort that they had and of course when Hubert Davis the desperation comes with they need this game in order to booster their opportunities to get into the NCAA tournament as an atlarge bid lets show you some of the early game highlights you may have missed Jaden Gardner made his first four shots from the floor Jane Gardner got off to a great start for Virginia getting a job done in the midrange and hes always been an outlet for his teammates once they touch the paint and thats a key for Virginia in this game but on the other side its been about North Carolinas threepoint shooting Pete Nash lining it up in the corner knocking it down RJ Davis off of Knight speed from leaky black and of course Nance once again being available keeping the pressure off of Armando baycott on the interior opening up things and thats going to be important for the for the Tar Heels here on their home floor and here is a look at the Tar Heels resume as everyone knows they have yet to pick up a quad one win this would be it tonight they are still very much in the mix but so little margin for error at this point Corey very little margin for error if any meaning that they have to win out when you consider the fact that theyve got Virginia here today an opportunity to get a quad one win they go to Tallahassee on Monday and then back here for senior night against the Rival Duke Blue Devils this is a must win for North Carolina they have to get it in order to find themselves into any chance of being in the field for Joe Leonardis Bracketology and once again Welcome to our Sonic Blockbuster matchup here on ESPN the Virginia Cavaliers ranked sixth in the country against the North Carolina Tar Heels it is a sea of Carolina blue here in the Smith Center and it was rocking in this building to start the Tar Heel faithful had the swag surf going perfectly you were a little off I was on point I want to look at the videotape I dont think I was on check the video you were a little off but they had it rocking in here and again the best time to play a game in this building is Saturday afternoon Saturday evening it is jampacked and the fans here the Tar Heel faith will recognize the importance of this game and seemingly so too did the players and again its remarkable that this collection of players that had such a great run last year and has been together largely for the last three years needs to be reminded repeatedly as their coach says to bring effort and passion and that is what went down at halftime in their game Wednesday where they rallied to beat Notre Dame in that game Corey they were two for 23 shooting threes so far tonight they are four of eight what a difference well they were two for 23 overall but over 11 in the first half and theyre shooting percentage in the first half of their game on Wednesday was the lowest since the 1979 stall game where they were over two in the first half thats how bad it is Angel you got something on that well guys I was covering that game and you can obviously understand how nervous I was to talk to coach Davis at halftime he looked at me and I said coach at this point how did you grade their sense of urgency and effort he said FF minus he said he challenged them to just give more it didnt come down to defense for making shots it was just their communication were seeing a different team today and right after Angel spoke to coach Davis he went into the locker room and had what he called a heated discussion and it wasnt just Hubert apparently assistant coaches Jeff Lebo and Brad Frederick as well as the Director of basketball operations Eric Hoots all went in and lit him up well and theres good reason for that as we see Isaac and Neil they step up and knock down the jumper but the good reason for that is because when you look at the coaching staff you look at the bench for North Carolina each and every one of these men has worn North Carolina across their chest theres a certain level of Pride they take in this program and they didnt feel as though their players on the floor were exemplifying that manner Nance tell you what he seems like a different player lately 11 points already coming off an 11 point 10 rebound five assists game at Notre Dame Wednesday well Dougie fresh this is year five for Pete Nance he came to North Carolina to a team that had played in the national championship game a year prior he wants the opportunity to play an NCAA tournament and compete for that and as of late hes playing like it Aidan Shedrick was fouled on the lob from Beekman well Pete Nance a year ago at Northwestern shot 45 percent from the yard well below that so far this year you know an off of a loose ball Pete Nance finds himself in the right spot leaky block finding Nance was able to line up the three and knock it down and again this is an area in the first matchup between these two teams Virginia won all the hustle plays Virginia dominated points in the paint they got to all the 5050 balls thus far in this game North Carolina has been the aggressor Hayden Shedrick coming off the bench for a night straight game actually the last time he started for Virginia was the game against North Carolina back on January 10th and with Tony Bennett found in that game was the lineup with Bennett vanderplas at the five going a little bit smaller at times and Virginia found something offensively that has worked for them with Cedric now coming off the bench but we have to remember Armando baycott not in that game Kaden Shedrick is much more needed in this one to defend the bigs of the Tar Heels and big cot went down with an ankle injury about 78 seconds into that game and so he did not play for the better part of it and Nance was out with injury as well so a much bigger North Carolina team facing UVA tonight heres Nance Music ball comes to Kihei Clark good fight on the floor by Shedrick and a foul in the backcourt or is it a clock clock violations Amy lucky pointing to the clock he hey Clark wondering why are you stopping play with two Tar Heels down in the backcourt after reaching diving on the floor for the basketball but it was a clock issue Jamie lucky recognizing it Jamie lucky John Gaffney Bert Smith our Trio of officials here tonight at the dean E Smith Center Applause Franklin McNeely and bark around the perimeter Applause back to Shedrick and a traveling violation Armando baked cotton with a good defense forcing the second Virginia turnover of the night but at this point when Kia Clark gets into the painted area he has to be more aggressive looking to get his shot off they caught his flat foot at that point hes not going to be able to block his shot kieh has to be able to recognize the difference between when he needs to try to score and when he needs to try to pass Applause DeMarco Dunn on the floor for Carolina tough Johnson as well Applause Nance lobs it inside intended for bacon Armando was the last to touch though a little too soft on that pass he threw that up for anybody to be able to get to it Pete Nance has to be a little more decisive in getting that basketball inside to bacon throwing it to where only his teammate can get it but put it on the line not so much air underneath it Applause Clark gives to Gardner Applause heres Caleb love the 64 Junior from St Louis to bacon back out to a wide open dime they got back Taps it Carolina keeps possession Applause done being aggressive lost his footing fifth turnover for Carolina tough shot Johnson keeps it alive and puff has the basketball missed opportunity for Virginia off the gray defense Amon Franklins going to wish he had those back Carolina has Corey without Batman Armando baycott scoring the basketball yet well you have to also remember that Virginia trailed the entire game on Wednesday never LED against Boston College and they havent LED in this game yet its been all North Carolina from the start and weve seen this coming for Virginia theyve been a little sideways they struggled to beat Louisville struggled to beat Notre Dame and then they did finally lose by double figures at Boston College seven straight games where Virginia has not scored 70 points but I can tell you right now this young man Jane Gardner is not the reason for that hes gotten off to a great start here already double figures for garden well you dont score 2 000 plus points in your career both ECU and in Virginia not be able to put points on the board 10 points to lead the hoos whistle off the ball it goes against Virginia and against Isaac McNeely Jaden Gardner has five of Virginias seven made field goals he continues to operate on the block with precision Music Applause Music Music he has had a masterful game stuff Applause the college game day crew will be there tomorrow beginning at 11 AM Eastern Time a chance to see a couple of Great Big Ten Conference games Indiana or teams Indiana and Iowa with star power all over the floor Corey I will be checking it out of course my sis Andrea Carter L Duncan Carolyn Peck the whole crew one site here weve got under six and a half minutes remaining in the first half and Carolina stays hot from the perimeter that is their sixth made threepointer of the night Doug you go back two weeks ago you angel and I are here calling a game North Carolina goes 15 of 33 from three against Clemson of course ever since then they go on a tremendous slide shooting the basketball terribly from Beyond the threepoint Arc but you see theyre capable of that in this building and Ill say what Ive said a million times I dont know how college basketball coaches do it puff Johnson whos mom Amy scored over a thousand points at Kent State has given Carolina its largest lead of the night I ask you Corey youve been in the coaching game how do coaches deal with the ups and downs that are college basketball well they get paid a lot of money and they have a lot of sleepless nights its been a band Applause steps up and knocks down the big three in response so making a single digit game once again but Huber Davis of course as a player recognizes what its like to have the Ebbs and flows of the game and right now he is learning it the hard way as a coach was fouled bin abandon Paul slipping the screen stepping out knocking down to three necessary for Virginia but on the other end of the floor buff Johnson back to back threes as hes feeling confident here in the dean Dome this evening I mentioned is Mom Amy after her college career Kent State a 511 guard she went and played professional basketball as well and of course you know Puffs older brother cam played in Pittsburgh got his degree from the University of Pittsburgh before transferring and playing a couple of years here in Chapel Hill and putting together a nice NBA career and plus father also played basketball at pitch awkward tough pregame and he said Im the only one that didnt go to pit at least for a stent anyway but his dad is in great shape looks like he can steal hoop well his dad was the quintessential Big East power forward of that day Applause Rim they caught another rebound Music makeup with a high dribble and called to the offensive foul well coming up next eight oclock Eastern Duke will host Virginia Tech at Cameron Indoor and finally number 15 Saint Marys takes on number 12 Gonzaga for the WCC regular season titled boy what a day for ACC basketball here on the triangle absolutely has been youre talking about Clemson at NC State at noon today Brad Brownell and his Squad going into PNC getting a huge win weve got a big game here right now and then of course to follow it up Virginia Tech at Duke Carolina catches a break on the pass from Davis and bacon cashes it in for his first dude foreign ER Falls after the rebound and hes gone for the over the backbound we go back to the 50 50 plays the loose balls going after it with aggression Armando baycott even though its an Eric pass is able to come up with the loose ball and finish it off ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is brought to you by the Sonic steak and bacon grilled cheese for a limited time only at Sonic Music Applause Music assist ratio has been a problem for Carolina this year but certainly not so far tonight Corey has not been North Carolina with eight assists on the 11made field goals and sharing the basketball extremely well amazing you asked Huber Davis earlier today how do you create that spacing without being able to make shots and he made it simple in plain when he answered you and said you cant there you go its that simple in the NBA you can because you have illegal defense but in college basketball it does not happen you have to make shots to be able to create that spacing and theyve done that here this evening making shots covers up an awful lot of hills in the game of basketball thank you Davis the shooting continues eight points for Davis including a pair of triples but sometimes you just have to tip your hat if youre Tony Bennett you just have to say listen guys if they make these shots its going to be difficult for us to beat them RJ Davis just goes into his individual bag makes a nice move on a great defender and Kihei Clark and again plays like this this is simply just about Talent RJ Davis has the ability to get enough separation from kie a Clark raise up knocked down his shot from about 22 feet away and if you can do that you can beat Virginia but Virginia normally makes it difficult to do that that was the first foul on tough Johnson just the Third on Carolina here in a cleanly played first half Armon Franklin with a nice drive and Lefty finish nice takeoff Franklin right there getting downhill not settling for the jump shot putting pressure on leaky black to keep him out of the paint first two points for the senior out of Cathedral High School in Indianapolis Davis takes the contact and scores now coming into this game this would have been the last thing I thought that we would see RJ Davis and Kihei Clark going at it on the Block I dont think anyone was expecting to see post play between these two guards but we got it and RJ was the beneficiary of it now hes already in double figures with 10 points that follows on Gardner the help Defender picking up his first Davis completes the threepoint play give him 11 hes averaging just under 16 points per game now after a couple of down games Brian Dunn into the game for the first time for UVA heres mcneeling hes in trouble done Applause Franklin attacks turn shoots no offensive rebound Virginia beekmans had a quiet night so far great bounce pass to Franklin on the back door cup nice fine by Reese Beekman recognizing and more importantly a great cut by Armon Franklin getting behind the defense and finishing it off but right now Virginia struggling on this end of the floor to stop the Tar Heels who are operating on all cylinders offensively on the back side the whistle as the pass was kicked by a Virginia Defender well heres our final big Monday doubleheader before champ week North Carolina as weve talked about is on the wrong side of Joe Leonardis bubble right now it takes on Florida State at 7 Eastern on Monday and then number nine Baylor squares off against Oklahoma State both games are right here on ESPN and they ask the Bears with a big win over Texas today 8172 speaking of big wins how about a huge win from Florida State going to Miami and knocking off the top team in the ACC Leonard Hamilton coaching his guys up and continuing to get better as the season goes along yeah Seminoles 85 hurricanes 84 recently Reese Beekman draws Virginia back to within 15 those are the shots that Reese Beekman the Kia Clark are going to have to be willing to take in this game but those twos versus the threes are going to be the problem right now North Carolina shooting the basketball the way that they have 619 inside the painted area but 815 but 24 points outside has been a difference for them in comparison to Virginia is that ratio okay for you Corey the ratio is fine when theyre making them but the problem is when theyre not making them you have to continue to get the basketball inside but while theyre hot continue to use it as a weapon mcneeland top Runner off the window Four Points Off the Bench for the Freshman from Coca West Virginia behind the back to split the double team dangerous move by love but it works out Baker big Collision offensive foul thats number two on number five in white but heres the problem with that Armando Bangkok pled guilty when he makes the move and he hits done forgive me thats Gardner he stops if Armando Bangkok Just Hits Gardner and goes up is probably not going to be an offensive foul even though the contact was the same because its a primary Defender inside that restricted area it cant be an offensive foul but he stopped and pretty much pled guilty I like that so he will sit for the final seconds of this first half to protect him with those two fouls mcdealand Brian Dunn missed the layup Davis traps down yet another rebound for North Carolina which can hold it for a final shot here in the first half Im out Tar Heels and well take a break with them back in 30 seconds to the dean Dome Music oh man thats cool Im really liking what youre doing with this overall shape shes a little shy right now she understands shes being painted opening shot a car comes in to front oh Bernie come on yes are you goofing no no yes Im good at this coming up on the Jeep Halftime Report with Rhys Davis Sean Farnam and Seth Greenberg buzzer beaters bubble teams unbelievable comeback today by Iowa they were down double figures with a minute to go Corey and beat Michigan State in overtime and I believe I saw on the ticker they scored 20 points in 90 seconds was it something like that for Iowa to be able to come back and get that win they had five threes I think in the last minute and change something crazy so theyll have all of that coming up from the halftime report that will be out in Spokane as they get ready for the big game out on the West Coast Conference later tonight between Saint Marys and Gonzaga 12 seconds of the first half here between Carolina and Virginia the Tar Heels have been in command from the start stop puts it up what a finish to the first half for Pete Nance and the Tar Heels but its just been that type of evening for the Tar Heels thus far the broken play ends up with Pete Nash having to force it to get a shot off at the halftime buzzer but yet it works right now Pete Applause heres a look at our first half stats brought to you by IHOP Corey and when you look at the numbers you think about the 58 percent from the field for North Carolina Virginia gave up 52 percent for the game to Boston College on Wednesday and right now the struggle for Tony Bennett has been defensively Jaden Garner off to a good start not getting much help Ben vanderplas thats a good start to the second half for the Cavaliers and thats only the second made threepoint field goal for Virginia and benedaz has both of those threes so right now Tony Bennett trying to find ways to free him up on the offensive end and lets go over to Angel as I was able to catch up with Huber Davis and I was just asking what the difference was from his team from the last game against Notre Dame and now he said honestly it starts with the unit its not just one person I was trying to highlight Pete Nance but he said overall it doesnt come down to one person we all have to be aggressive and thats whats worked offensively he said defensively hes pleased with how theyve been able to contain Beekman as well as Armon Franklin theyve held him to Four Points at times Ive seen puff Johnson face guarding Armon Franklin as well so knowing that energy that he was asking for started on the defensive end in the first half and Angel Tony Bennett told us pregame without their guards really having successful games theres not much of a chance for Virginia he needs those guards to be able to get going but right now looks like theyre focusing on benebend Applause early to start the second half after a couple of vanderplas buckets to begin the second half the Carolina crowd started to make some noise again this is the same Carolina team that through their first seven games of the month of February were largely disconnected other than two Saturdays ago when we were here and they laid it to Clemson they look great that day they did but not a great start for North Carolina to start this second half as Virginias gotten all to a 70 run to start in the second half and right now Huber Davis going to play it out no time out but the crowd here starting to get anxious they know that this game was not over to end the first half Davis Nance black love and bacon same starting five in the second half for Carolina same starting 54 Virginia theres a missed shot cleaned up by Armando Baker and thats the way you stop a run offensive rebounds Second Chance points Armando Baker in this game on this floor a year ago 29 Points 22 rebounds against the Home State team in his first win ever against Virginia and you know what Mondo is now 15 points shy of passing Michael Jordan on the alltime Carolina scoring list he is currently number 15 he would move up to 14 Vander floss first Miss of his since the intermission Applause draws the double team hits it back face the pass to Davis and goes back to work before the double team comes misses the shot Gardner Dives and saves it for Virginia great hustle for Jane Gardner to keep that possession alive ka Clark right there to pick it up three Speakman trying to get downhill back out to Clark looking for his first points Reese Beekman the assist and Clark with his first three and ka clock has to look to score averages 12 points a game in ACC play he has to be a scorer for Virginia to be successful Applause Music Applause Nance to the corner four black much like Kihei Clark at the other end his first three points come here in the second that is leaky black spot you find them in the corner normally hes going to knock it down all right Clark thought about it gives to Beekman drives around Nance uses the rim to Shield the defender but you can see to start this second half both Kihei Flor and Reese Beekman looking a little more aggressive Im sure something that Tony Bennett talked to his team about at halftime Applause tend to shoot Davis into the lane draws a foul and a chance for three Applause ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is brought to you by the Sonic steak and bacon grilled cheese for a limited time only at Sonic Music Applause versus Carolina a storied rivalry and one of our final Sonic Blockbuster Games that is a week from tonight and it always according to J billis delivers one difference with this years Duke North Carolina finale a mustwin game for the Tar Heels coming into this building and of course we talked about in the pregame today North Carolina has to win out to give themselves a chance at an atlarge bid that would be another opportunity for a quad one win where the Blue Devils coming to the denom and RJ Davis has been bringing it with 14 points to lead all scorers Harmon Franklin draws the contact and well head to the freethrow line with the and one once again that concerted effort by the whos to get to the rim weve seen Kihei Clark attacking weve seen Reese Beekman this time as Armon Franklin with the pump they gets bacon in the air and then drawing the contact finishing it off for the end one and thats going to be the third foul on Armando baycott so something that Huber Davis is going to have to manage for the remainder 1516 well the momentum in the first four minutes and 45 seconds of the second half has been all Virginia all right Mark is all over Davis who keeps his dribble gets away Applause fence had a big first half for Carolina he is fouled on the floor before the shot I dont know Music well looking ahead at the Cavaliers next game they are at home Tuesday night squaring off against Clemson on acc Network that ones a seven Eastern start part of accns doubleheader followed by Virginia Tech versus Louisville at 9 00 pm Eastern big bounce back for Brad Brownell the his Squad today getting a win at NC State when I know that building was Rocket Man Im telling you the ACC college basketball will make you scratch your head every Saturday it absolutely will and again 11 quality teams right now into ACC teams continue to get better as the season goes along Clark into the lane picks up the dribble and brings it back out to vanderplas Applause loss flashes Johnson without Armando bacon in there with the three fouls the Tar Heels are going to have to have someone else play Big inside but thats not really been a band of plass game though if you got somebody you want to play back to the basket with you want the basketball to be in the hands of Jaden Gardner and I understand Vander Falls continue to be aggressive which he has to but thats not really his game Nance created a little space and puts it through now 16 points but thats knowing who you are beating ants isnt it back to the basket guy either so he faces up goes off the dribble and finds two points there goes Vander floss again backing down Beekman for three Music thats one of the parts of RJ Daviss game we dont talk enough about he is a very good rebounder that is his eighth here tonight and a blocking foul down at the other end Ive been in the building before to see RJ Davis go into double figures with his rebounding and more importantly what he did on the last possession does a great job helping out his big guys who are dealing with trying to box out and coming in and picking up that eighth rebound foul number three on vanderploff so he will exit replaced by mcneeland well weve talked about the fact that RJ Daviss Father Robert Davis was a division two scoring Legend at Mercy College in Dobbs Ferry New York still the alltime leading scorer in that programs history over 2100 I asked RJ this morning whos the better shooter you or Dad without question he says its him and then I said when was the last time your dad beat you and RJ said he hadnt played me since I was 12 I said thats a smart move thats a smart move but you talk about the better shooter whos a better shooting shooter in the building right now we got a couple of great candidates we do and neither of them are in shorts the two head coaches are probably the two best Shooters inside the dean dome right now and weve got numbers to back it up as the shot clock goes down Davis Drive and Dish puff Johnson Applause they both came out of college Davis and Bennett from Carolina and from Green Bay in 1992 first round pick for Davis second round pick for Bennett and they were both excellent threepoint Shooters and still record holders in fact Tony Bennett still holds the alltime career record for threepoint shooting percentage in college basketball history while Hubert by percentage is the best in Carolina history Im still going back to where you said theyre not in shorts I thought you were talking about myself or Shimon Williams but Ill let it go well as coach Bennett told us before the game hey the numbers back it up absolutely do and again when you look at these two teams and the shooting struggles theyve had over this season thats a head scratcher how can you struggle to shoot the basketball when your coaches were so great theres the man for Virginia you want in close Jayden Gardner built like a football player now with 14 points and as you look now the lead into single digits the crowd here at the dean Dome trying to encourage their team they do not want Virginia to build momentum here North Carolinas home floor Davis attacks and denied by done Applause Gardner had it taken away uncharacteristic Virginia turns it over and about as few as any team in the country only 89 per game especially in a run like this when theyve got momentum on their side very uncharacteristic and their fourth best in the country in that statistic Corey what was once a 17point lead is down to nine and a timeout called by Tony Bennett theyre the two best shoot not Corey Alexander Tony Bennett Hubert Davis the two best Shooters in the building tonight all subjective my friend the numbers show it numbers dont mean at all Music theyre all kinds Virginia working their way back in thats the update for the men but let me give you a highlight for the womens side tomorrow its going to be a class of two top 10 teams between Iowa and Indiana McKenzie Homes as well as Caitlin Clark can definitely put on a show so you want to make sure you have your popcorn ready going back to Caitlin Clark she is in range when she steps in the arena and McKenzie Holmes has been absolutely amazing dominating on the inside and you already highlighted a couple of things as far as what we saw from the mens side with threes going up in the last minute and a half of their game I can see them carrying it over for tomorrow as well guys no doubt what a womens basketball double whip header we have for you tomorrow afternoon on ESPN in the app as she mentioned number 10 Notre Dame taking on Louisville at noon Eastern and then the big one Caitlin Clark in number six Iowa hosting McKenzie Homes in number two Indiana our coverage tomorrow begins with college game day at 11 AM Eastern back to Chapel Hill right after this inventions can Chapel Hill with Carolina leading by nine and Cavaliers head coach Tony Bennett told us before the game how important it was Corey for his guards to play big if they wanted to get a win here today what have you seen so far well weve seen them being more aggressive to start the second half Kia Clark knocking down a three Reese Beekman and almond Franklin both attacking the basket and those guards were a large part of the 102 run to start the second half for Virginia and the main reason as to why theyve been able to make this deficit now a single digit deficit but Armando baycat at the free throw line trying to get it back to double figures they caught one of two players in this game with three personal fouls Van Der floss has 34 Virginian he remains on the Wahoos bench bacon has had for him a relatively quiet game with eight points little under half as average along with five rebounds now give him nine and five is 67 career double doubles the most in program history in time for fourth most in ACC history with Tom Burleson who we saw last weekend at NC State thank you Ryan Dunn dangerous pass McNeely nice job to Corral it and land inbounds there goes Beekman off the bounce nice job by love to stay with him knocked it away shot clock down to five Dunns got to go he gives it up to Beekman love an excellent defensive sequence and something to say afterward to Mr Beekman Schubert Davis has said for three years Caleb love can be an elite Defender and Caleb love just showed all of us that he can be an elite Defender staying in front of Reese Beekman is not an easy task Applause the double team gets the ball out of his hands at least for the moment he reposts as the ball goes to the other side to love seven seconds to shoot love on the other end no big rebound for done Applause big screen by Gardner frees the open shot by Clark but he missed it beginning of this game the first half was North Carolinas Pace this second half thus far has been Virginias pace and Virginia cutting into the lead however missed on a number of opportunities to get even closer in this game in the second half have to be able to take advantage of these turnovers when they get them havent done a great job of that here this evening and Beekman with the forced turnover and theyve just not been shooting it as well Carolina nine made threepointers in the first half just one so far here in the second Corey Tar Heels with numbers if they hurry Davis has it poked Away by Clark crowd wants a reach in foul which doesnt count Davis quickly into bacon over the left shoulder theres the big man and Armando has something to say he looks over and Steve personal his Sid who wants him shooting jump hooks more often and just lets them know Ive got that in my game yeah there was quite a detailed discussion this morning about that during shoot around and cars even though it doesnt look like it hes excited about seeing Mondo go to the block and go to work Bangkok getting the job done back to the basket with the contact able to finish with the right hand jump rope going over the top making sure that its recognized by curse second foul on puff Johnson s been around for four years still willing to listen to anybody to help get better as a basketball player and Steve kerstner is on record of saying he is one of my top five players Ive ever had in this program Applause Music Kirsch has been here for decades I believe it the outside of course Freddie Carter and John madder are two guys that help us out with our stats I believe that Steve Kershner may be at the top of the list when it comes to the Carolina history and of course Freddie right beside curse these two guys alongside John right over here beside us have all the Carolina knowledge they are pillars anytime we come to the triangle were happy to see him and work with him under eight and a half minutes to go Nance gets double brings it out to love with a clean look Applause Clark Franklin McNeely Gardner and Dunn the five on the floor for Virginia whistle off the ball and if its on bacon thats number four and I do believe that is going to be on Bay cotton just like that leaky black will be back into the game a quick break for leaky black as Armando bacon exits with the four fouls Applause but this is a lineup That Huber Davis is comfortable with especially when Pete Nance has played the way he has throughout this game Applause its well chronicled how leaky black can defend anybody on the floor with his size and length and instincts very versatile weapon on this end Clark is fouled by Davis and will shoot two free throws when we come back to a rock and Dean dome in Chapel Hill and then you know two weeks from tomorrow Corey is selection Sunday and theres so much yet to be decided it absolutely is and when you think about the North Carolina Tar Heels they have a important two weeks coming up as Kia clock goes to the free throw line and breaks what has been a four minute and 23 Second scoring drought for Virginia but Clemson with a big win today getting right to the top of Joy brackets next four out an important game for the Clemson Tigers heading to Charlottesville on Tuesday to face the Virginia Cavaliers who won a battle here in Chapel Hill and the biggest result so far on Saturday in the ACC was Matthew Clevelands buzzer beater to lift Florida state from a 25point deficit to beat Miami off the dance Miss McNeely the rebound Applause Music Gardner and McNeely out there for uba no Flop Call no foul call play continues and yet UNC does not give up a bucket missed opportunity right there by Jaden Gardner just concentration went away a little bit expecting for a whistle to be blown misses a point blank layup another deflection by Beekman out of bounds Carolina wookie in Virginia now who started the second half making six of his first seven field goals since then just one of their last 12 opportunities Applause gives it back to this beautiful twoman game but it Nets no points for Carolina Applause gives back to Gardner on the screen enrolled denied by Nance but with Gardner having Johnson on his back thats one I would love to have seen Jade Gardner just be aggressive Johnson and Gardner both go down hard no call The Whistle comes against Franklin as the ball was pushed into the front court but a hard foul Im sorry not a hard fall for both players I dont see any advantage either way both guys going after the basketball and all honestly Gardner creates the contact but thats not a foul he has the right to go after the basketball in the air both guys falling hard I love the fact that there was no whistleblown on that call puff Johnson wants to call of course Jayden Gardner wants the call but I like Bert Smiths reaction of not blowing the whistle Gardner takes a seat leaky over here sitting on our table trying to get a quick yeah trying to get a quick breather huh well you know he spends a lot of energy on defense Ill give him that well rested leaky black sets a screen for love inside Nance Applause the grad transfer from Akron now has 18 points and dancers missed a couple of chippies around the basket left no doubt on that possession John gives it back to Pinkman man says no way Vander Falls another missed layup by Virginia but the foul goes against the Tar Heels Applause Music Caleb love coming off the screen threads the needle between two Virginia Defenders and Pete Nance out here stutting like his daddy finishing with two hands you know his dad was a Slam Dunk champion I do Im holding you I remember that stuff you know I got to check you you got a lot of big ease knowledge Im not sure about all your ACC knowledge I remember foreign has missed a ton of layoffs here today just like they did on Wednesday in the loss to Boston College and now vanderplas misses at the free throw line and an opportunity to get chips if he misses this second that would be Pringles potato chips Pringles for everybody but vanderplas grabs the miss Vanderpump shovel pass Dunn tries to dunk it in again Nance protecting that Rim he lets out a couple of streams to the stands he has put forth a marvelous effort tonight and the stands are reciprocating this crowd on their feet applauding Pete Nance not only for his effort offensively but what hes doing defensively as well love lost it Beekman again in the middle of it and hes fouled from behind by Davis file number three on Davis started off this game getting the job done offensively but now its been about his defense blocking shots on the last two possessions offensively for Virginia covering up the rim not allowing any easy buckets seventh team foul on the Tar Heels so a 11 coming for Beekman who is the best foul shooter on this Virginia team at 81 percent and so the third year from Milwaukee to the line Virginia four for eight from the free throw line in a game where you are trying to mount a comeback they dug a hole for themselves early cannot afford to give away points travel or trailed by as many as 17 points late in that first half they were down by 16 at the intermission thats foul number three on Gardner lets go to Angel gray guys were seeing a team thats just playing loose I was talking to Hubert Davis as far as his team and he just mentioned he told me a story he said he gave him a weighted vest for practice and after a few minutes a few of the guys asked him all right coach whats the purpose of this why are we doing this he said because this is the unnecessary weight that youve taken onto the floor he said handling being preseason number one being compared to last years team social media news article saying what are we doing at this point were on the bubble he said if we play together take that weighted vest off and understand we do this together and play at ease and were seeing that tonight well angel I can tell you that weighted vest has a different meaning here in this building the weighted best used to be with Coach Dean Smith would hand his players and tell them to run the stairs so it has built some character in this program as Reese Beekman gets to the bucket and is able to stop the run for North Carolina the finish the hoop the harm and the opportunity for the add one but that weighted best May mean different things to different players one Music Corey either way I dont think they wanted the best on but I think they did get the message and just overall youre seeing just more of a vocal in communication from the leadership on Carolinas team at this point and he challenged him to be better he was not pleased with how they were able to walk away with the win at Notre Dame but just wanting a little bit more out of his team you already mentioned losing five of their last seven how do they respond that was the biggest question coming into this one absolutely they responded sharing the basketball continuing the movement as you mentioned Angel the chemistry has been there for the Hills tonight but you have to give their home crowd a lot of credit for helping out and that was not a block a blocked shot by Nance but he changed that shot attempt and after being so good at Notre Dame Wednesday with 11 points 10 rebounds five assists Pete Nance even better here tonight right from the start hes got 20 points and Counting you will head to the free throw line off a nice job on the screen and roll well you mentioned uh his dad the Slam Dunk champ but hes not the only one because his older brother after starring at Wyoming was a first round pick in 2015 hes put together a very nice NBA career he absolutely has and you want to talk about athleticism it is in the jeans Pete Nance showing off his athleticism blocking shots finishing at The Rim throughout this game but his brother and his father two of the better athletes to ever play this game Angel you know a little about that just a tad because Im honored to build a relationship with their family during my time in Cleveland and just getting to know Larry Nance senior he always just challenges guys to just be competitive the entire time I know Larry Nance Jr right now with the Pelicans we saw him throw down a lot of different dunks but I was able to catch up with him about saying whose time is it now he said my brother after tying the game for one of the buzzer beaters its his time step up and were seeing him step up tonight well his 22 points for Pete Nance the second most hes had this year he went for 28 against Portland at the PK 85 hes got the basketball now Music Applause Music to the corner for Johnson love 43 rebound to Franklin Applause Clark with a long twopoint jumper its good Music Applause thats Kihei Clarks game right there picking up with the pressure and turning defense into possible offense but Pete Nez having no parts of it Applause another block shot by Nance but they are counting the basket as play continued and a chance for a threepoint play for Virginia do the Wahoos have another push in him in the final three minutes ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is brought to you by Wendys two for six dollars the best deal in fast food Music tonight and these highlights are brought to you by the number four Dougie fresh he missed four for four from Beyond the threepoint line hes four for four from the free throw line and he has four blocks all here in the second half to Anchor the defense for the Tar Heels you grew up watching Sesame Street didnt you oh did I by the way Virginia had missed four free throws in a row now five straight free throws here in this second half while trying to get back into this game impossible to come back from 17 down if you cant make a free throw 240 left in regulation nice job by Clark to keep Davis out of the lane now Loves got to go to work great job by beatman to stick to him but this is part of the reason why Caleb loves free throws I mean his shooting percentage is so low grenade want to shoot this way throw it to him as Jayden Garner is able to step up and knock down another midrange and Caleb love doesnt always help himself but he has to take two three of those shots per game 16 points for Jaden Gardner Applause foreign for you to point out that Nance handed the ball off to number four I was going to point out that Armando bacon has not come back into this game Pete Nance has played so well that Huber Davis has allowed bacon to sit and Franklin gets out with the Finish By Number Four and just like that its an eightpoint game Franklins got nine and a foul against Virginia before the inbound as Davis tried to get free foul number two on Kihei Clark Music and great Hands by Armon Franklin getting out on the break and finishing it off and now that is a single digit game Huber Davis decides its time to get Armando baycott back in the game 127 remaining as North Carolina tries to finish this one up but Virginias been able to find a little momentum here as of late 116 rebounds so far for bakot as he takes his place along the lane with Davis at the line Applause coming up next eight oclock Eastern time Duke will host Virginia Tech and Cameron Indoor and finally capping things off on a wild Saturday of college hoops number 15 St Marys takes on number 12 Gonzaga for the WCC regular season title all coming up later tonight here on ESPN a great day in college basketball and ESPN a bunch of great games and meaningful games to a lot of different teams leaky blast with the block the accs defensive player of the year coming up with a huge block a number of candidates on the floor two from Virginia and Beekman and Kia Clark but leaky black has been the god that has signed the brightest and then black gets fouled and will shoot two great play by Kihei Clark faking the handoff however leaky black erasing it at The Rim and after the performances hes had throughout this season we mentioned Hunter Tyson coming into this building only getting two field goal attempts against leaky black Isaiah Wong only eight points against Lincoln black he has continued to be a stellar Defender all season long and in my opinion has earned the accs defensive player of the year award for this season and I asked Steve Kershner the Sid for North Carolina this morning about is leaky really six foot nine you you werent so sure a couple of weeks ago and Im still not sure he says hes six eight in his stockings beat six eight and a half in his shoes and according to Dean Smith Ive never seen anyone play in their stocking feet and we round up at six eight and a half now let me tell you what I havent seen anyone playing basketball shoes that only give you a half an inch it doesnt work like that Music so what are you saying Im 76 but regardless as the as the heaven and a half he has been awesome defensively this entire season for North Carolina and throughout all their ups and downs he has been the constant on the defensive end for Huber Davis third foul on Kihei Clark will send Caleb love to the foul line well earlier this year Carolina had what at the time was a quad one victory over Ohio State but with the Buckeyes falling back they are back to over in these top wins but that is 47 seconds away from changing and making that resume Corey look a little bit better Joe Leonardi said coming into the game beating Virginia today doesnt put them into the current field of 68 but obviously it keeps them alive Gardner with a chance for three a nice play right there by Jaden Gardner attacking the offensive glass coming up with the foot back and scoring it and once again trying to get this into single digits at the free throw line where Virginia has struggled throughout this game but 388 seconds remaining if he makes his free throw its a three possession game and we have seen crazier things happen even today Iowa came from 11 down with about a minute to go to beat Michigan State in overtime because Tony Bennetts team have that same kind of comeback in him Music Applause there are all kinds of products in this world things easier more and more fun but

Tech team that is dangerous every time they take the floor absolutely when you think about the this game Virginia Tech of course has had success as of late but theyve struggled on the road the Duke Blue Devils continue to get better as this season has gone along and right now youre talking about a 1015 minute drive over to Cameron Indoor there have been people in the area who are trying to make a complete triangle between NC State this afternoon Chapel Hill at six and theyll make it over to the Virginia Tech Duke game tonight at 8 oclock very doable a noon game a six oclock game and an eight oclock game the smart move would to have been to leave the dean Dome already to beat this traffic to get yourself over to Cameron to catch most of that game all right guys John Madre and Freddie Kiger on the back end of their double header but theyre not heading over to Cameron sparkly Music but you dont say you never want to leave this game too early I dont know no if youre going for a triple header no you dont want to leave this game too early all right well I dont want to leave this game too early Ive got responsibilities Applause coach Williams hes not leaving Music Rons not letting him leave no he doesnt have a choice he has to stick around Music happy wife happy life Music the clock started running early before Kihei Clark touched it so they will get that rectified and we will do it again Tony Bennett not happy with the clock management but of course flashing the smile as always Franklin yes shot clock is off its an eightpoint ball game this is why you never want to leave this game too early Virginias going to play it out to the end all on the inbound as Puff Johnson hits the deck and thats the perfect foul very little time running off the clock right there for us North Carolina to go to the free throw line and make these free throws down the stretch Im on Franklin knocking down the three ball may have a number of those left in his clip he picks up just his second foul and so puff Johnson a 72 percent foul shooter on the year out of the same high school as John Calipari moon Area High School and Moon Township Pennsylvania just outside of Pittsburgh Applause two big misses for UNC Applause Franklin he gathers shoots and it rattles home its a sixpoint game ski black able to get it into Caleb love and the foul committed by Kihei Clark and that is his fourth foul the pressure is on North Carolina to finish this game at the free throw line Virginia is showing that they can make plays in a hurry to be able to cut into this lead nice catch Belmont Franklin and scoring off the glass to make it a two possession game Music love is a 76 percent foul shooter hes got nine points so far tonight Music Applause Clark challenges Nance well it may not have been a blocked shot but theres Mr Nance in the middle of it the star of the ball game for Carolina the grad transfer from Northwestern University and Carolina keeps his NCAA tournament hopes alive and a fitting way to end the game for North Carolina Pete Lance stepped up for the hills offensively in the first half and he stepped up for the heels defensively here in the second half as you mentioned he was absolutely the star of this game the guy
