there is jayen low one of the Freshman guards for the Panthers off the feder RICO screen and buob Harington the rookie counterpart to low missed it and they Zack Austin rather follows the Winston Salem native starts the scoring we check out the starting lineup for Wake boopy Miller is the second leading scorer behind Salis youve got Cam hildr and Andrew K double figures as well and then Fon Reed who had one of his best games of the season the first time these teams squ it Applause off good for pick coming out the first possession there man they missed the three and going to the offensive glass something they H in the first game Sal Strokes a three showed him fourth in the league and scoring for the Gaga transfer in the junior originally from Omaha hit starters meanwhile with the Freshman guards in the back court that we mentioned as theyve grown this team has jelled and come together inserting low in the starting line with Carrington has been a difference having multiple ball handlers and decision makers they cut down they turnovers just been able to get into their offense a lot better is legged coming off the bench here is low late shot clock here they got to get it up heres Blake Hinson top fall away and it belongs to Wade really good defensive possession there by the Geeks keeping everything in front forcing pit to a tough pullup jump shot there Salis off the bounce against Austin back out Miller on the Applause drive Miller of its last eight Steve forbess team meanwhile coming off back to back road losses well the decks a totally different team when they get home so they need to revert back to being what theyve been at home and try to build some momentum cuz theyre going to need to eventually get a game on the road foul here goes on Fon Reed the Wake big man and for both these teams the stakes enormous in terms of the Bracketology p is next for out according to Joe lardy and C Forbes team first four out so trying to push their way further into that picture they are and and played Just subtly we just missed there with the first foul on F Reed and he comes out of the game Steve for takes him out after his first foul you can ill for him picking up second foul and being done for the half hes such a vital part of this team and hes have to do a better job of protecting that first foul speaking of fouls buob Carrington The Freshman guard wanted one but didnt get it as Matt Marsh came in to replace Fon Reed for a wake team at 169 overall the losses at Duke and at Virginia when they only scored 47 points heres cam HR no dice from Deep Carrington clears it part of the Freshman back court for the Panthers and theyve got Blake hson as well Zack Austin was half alone tipped out secured by Andrew Carr Salis lost it and here is Henson lost the handle and recovers in the corner wake is insistent that he was out of bounds but Hensons going to work against bopy Miller and a traveling violation so a little Helter Skelter here these first few possessions a lot of nerve a lot of energy in the building as well these teams know theres a lot at stake and they know what theyre playing for and just need to settle down well settle into a good basketball game these are two really good teams that are just caught up in a moment right now only seen one shot attempt from Blake Hinson scoreless so far in the first three and a half minutes coming off a career high 41 on 9 threes in the win Saturday against Louisville Andrew Carr knocks it down and early on its a sixpoint wake for his lead Wake Center off as theyre getting getting the shots that they want there theres been some confusion on the Pittsburgh defense whether theyre switching or theyre not that time they didnt switch car made him play see the numbers for Henson and what hes coming off of into this one on the road for the Panthers Jaylen low Lefty freshman point guard answers the Texas native who moved into the starting lineup a month and a half ago Salis answers and thats the second three for hter Salis the number four score in the ACC hes the one guy from this line that consistently is proven that he can beat you from behind the line K cant be happy see him get two wide open threes here early Henson got it at the elbow off the shot fake he had it blocked by Salis fast start for the deakes at home Hunter Salis has him up by six mercedesbenz of South

in more ways than one I mean I became a man here in wi sett and Once I arrived here on campus I essentially never left people like Ron Wilman has so much to do with my development as a man and and also as a player and its just great to be be home and be able to share A Moment Like This cheers buddy its awesome to see oh Im glad you were here as well man thanks man great being your friend yeah you scored a few points weve heard about that huh theres a flush underneath for Matt Marsh and the lead is eight for Wake hor Lov the energy here early for the deakes and getting production out of Applause marsh its not something theyre always accustomed to but he goes to the offensive glass and those are the things he has to do to make his presence felt in a game like this L miss the jumper feder Rico feder Rico fought for the loose ball but Blake Henson went diving for it now low bounces it out and thats some Panthers grit to maintain possession this is a big match up here and WG does the switching one through four and car is on one of these point guards has to do a great job of making him take that shot three tapped out though by fed Rico to Henson who like the first meeting between these teams of few weeks ago has C hildr on him defensively Federico finishes for pit and that stops a 133 run great play there Jeff Cap realizing that wake is hedging that ball screen so he changes the angle puts it in the middle of the floor thatll Force weight now to have to rotate over a lot sooner than they have instead of a high ball screen in the center of the floor a side ball screen yeah well first time week played it they were in drop coverage they were just sitting back the lane and this time you see wake has changed that stru jayen loone locks down another thats his second triple and the Freshman has pit within three shouldnt be surprised both of these guys will get up over 20 25 threes a game and pit Le the ACC in over nine makes a game knock down two so far Salis has a couple heres booy Miller on a skip to Andrew Carr could knock it down capped out by Matt Marsh the key to this is what team controls the paint theyre so deadly from behind the threepoint line you see long shots long rebounds lets see who can control the paint car got fou by fed Rico well to that point in the first meeting Anon Reed did a lot of damage W big man was on the bench right now had one of his best games of the season with 14 but in the second half pit did such a great job of rebounding especially with its offensive rebounding and then will Jeffers came in on the interior down the stretch playing the five not the norm for him and he did great work against e Reed he did I think some of that was wake didnt do a great job of forcing the ball to he having himself having his way that game and I thought there was some opportunities that they left on the lets see if they try to take advantage of that tonight but e has to do a better job of staying out the C but that first round has to protect it in his back of the game now show that with the point why they took him out 14 points in that one tie to season High form along with 10 rebounds car connects on and the des lead is five s minutes Applause in six of the 10 pit points from jayen low L Hinson still scoreless and watch that match up top of your screen hild against Hinson like the first Mo Diaz gr knocks down at triple and this is what happen after Reed comes back in with that one foul they go to drop coverage and its difficult drop coverage to stop penetration its now with JZ out there gr step out knock down s is short but a foul calls Jeff C in his sixth year and hes the reigning ACC Coach of the Year were talking with him today about whats changed from one and five in the AC ACC to 8 and six in the ACC said weve defended better were making shots and just our team has grown up integrating those freshman guards and thats what happens and and you can see now whats happened with these freshman guards they taking a step and bu carington who came off hot then he settled down he started struggling a little bit hes wearing down so low gets inserted in the line now he gets less responsibilities and then Balls moving for everybody and I think this team is flourishing because of told you seven of eight and receiving votes in the top 25 as well went into Charlottesville and then blasted Louisville at the Pak 8659 on Saturday behind hinsons big day Parker Frederickson defending low hit another jump shot this time in the midrange and how about jayen low backing after those balls screes down knowing hes in drop coverage and that time they tried to switch and lo just elevated took his midrange jump shot ELD underneath to re for the plush great job getting in the ball easy picked on a little bit of defensive end nothing a big man loves than an easy dunk after setting the ball screen if youre a guard you want to reward if you get more of those all right lets talk about ball screens and drop coverage here so Reed comes out they actually switch it this time and turn it over pild in transition goes spinning and finishing great job that time they switched their coverage you you see they made the adjustment they switched de Mo Diaz little one Shore there and he got caught off guard tried to drive it and skip it didnt force any rotation and turnover low with a runner a shot that he loves the rebound to deari Monsanto and here come the Demon Deacons ahead of by a half dozen double team on Reed and he cops it up and Zack Austin saved it to jayen low Austin Winston Salem native to strong from Deep only connecting at 28 from long range I think twice he wasnt picked up in transition there when he settled for career I think the next time just catching riing and driving when they push tempo right now we had matched up against the defensively said him a couple times post up for Reed again another double a kick out to the Freshman sniper Frederickson at 41 the ball looks great every time he leaves his hand up great job of having him be the post entry didnt notice and sometimes understanding where the double tap is coming from pit doubles from the strong side balls side F just spaced over great job about read to kick it back out for the three first meeting wake led by 10 in the first half pit went off in the second half down by nine low trims it down to seven what a start for Jaylen low already in the double figures with 10 of the 17 and he swipes this one from Salis no reason for the deak to force it inside Reed he has physical advantage over Diaz Bram a couldnt follow M for on Santo Tapped Out by Reed who is the master of that on the offensive boards he does as good a job of that anyone in the ACC cant get to it do a great job of tipping it up on Santo got another from Deep he like Hinson those two guys can get going and knock down some defense I dont think theres very many to have the confidence to m but Blake hon does he he does but I dont know if he had the green light I should say Leed on the deck no whistle just yet and now weve got a held ball points to Wi so we havent heard from him just yet but on Saturday Blake hitson was

experience the Blockbuster triple header today on ESPN any response to the trade rumors we keep hearing about oh we talking about moving not the trade not the trade we talking about moving no thank you uh you you could use Open Door sell your house directly to them its easy I well the national player of the week in the country last week Blake Hinson because of what he did in large part Saturday against Louisville with a careerhigh 41 tied for the third most in pit Pro prog history on the strength of nine threes I I mean he shot it from everywhere and he did a great job of just using the size and shooting over smaller guards when they switch hes a matchup Nightmare and right now hasnt got quite going just yet I think he will get a little bit more aggressive but hes trying to figure out what wakes doing wakes doing a great job of changing the defenses against him theyre staying home hes going to draw a ton of coverage wait knows hes capable of beating that was a big Focus obviously for Steve corpes and again he told us it would be cam hildr on hson as boy Miller knocks down a fifth W for triple theyre just a different team when theyre home shooting I mean they shoot 41 from behind the threepoint line thats the biggest difference in this team met home and when theyre on a road theyre just under 30 on the road but when they hear theyre just lights out wers 13 and0 in this building this season their last six ACC losses then all on the road to the corner and awesome in driving and drawing a foul lets go back to the the Hinson hildr conversation here cuz Jeff cable said to us that they go into every game now wondering how teams are going to defend Blake Hinson and its hilr when hes in hes out right now so Salis gets the assignment if Hinson tries to take those guys into the post weit showed in the first meeting that theyre going to dumble theyre going to have to so when he you know when he sets that ball screen they havent gone to it as much I think theyll go to it when we get to the guts of the game as they get further involved in the game theyll set that ball screen to see how weake defends it h does is a great job he knows he has a size he has a disadvantage inside and a little cat Mouse game going on right now they dont want to show their hand too early but this game will revolve around when Blake Henson start setting that ball screen right now they going off the fivan tried to attack Eon Reed who just picked up his second foul which is big for the deeps lets see how the remaining of this half goes now with he with nothing Reed out of the game so hes out at the 815 Mark with his two with wake up by nine a guy who has totally changed wake Fours defense since he got his waiver approved as a twotime transfer back on December 5th and it changes everything because now you have masanto in now he has to guard hson Miller moves H for mon Santo hes got hson on him prying at it wrestling for it shot clock winding down and Frederickson hits another this freshman can shoot it you have got to be close enough to touch him when youre closing out I mean anything late you can forget about it Carrington cant respond Toby Frederickson 41

I dont know what will experience the Blockbuster triple header today on Music ESPN Wake Forest and pit tonight are playing for their postseason lives in Winston Salem wake one of the first four out cant move up with a win but can drop same for pit in the next four out group they need a win to avoid dropping off the bubble entirely so what is this game must win for both to live and fight another day so we hear it directly from Joe lardy that right now wake can pit considered hes not going to put them with these four teams hes already got in if they win this game doesnt mean its any less significant for both of them oh it is I mean its and its has to matter more for Wake because theyre at home and theyve already dropped the game a bit early in the year there has to be a sense of urgency for both of these teams and you heard him say that not be a benefit for Wake to be pit but Pits been playing well theyve been playing their best basketball of the season and theyre six and two on a row theres not many teams that can say that and theyve come out right now first half and theyve answer the BT pit down by 14 and you saw Jeff cable scratching his head tried to run something for Blake Hinson out of the timeout but Federico got tagged with his second foul so he goes to the bench and guo Diaz Graham replaces him hild snakes through Marsh couldnt handle it and awake for his turnover one thing you see though even though that possession ended in a turnover is wakes getting the ball in the paint legot was huge in the first meeting and he THS the F Steve corpes in his fourth year here in Winston Salem Jeff cable last year ACC Coach of the Year Steve corbes two years ago ACC coach of the year and he said to us today yeah we lost a couple on the road but no shame in that at Cameron at jpj but he felt like it was their offense which you dont often think of being the issue with wake is kind of letting them down against the Cavaliers its it hurts him on the road and again I mentioned this earlier they theyre shooting less than 30 from three and for a team that takes 22 a night thats tough to do on the road if you want to win its such a big part of their identity and they made six so far here in the first half me you see here like thats just the biggest difference look at the point difference why is that is that its you know what happens its just your rooll guys play better at home they feed off the crowd and you look at this game so far I mean all their guys are you know boopy Miller is all shooting two two of three Carr is one of two theyre just shooting Marsh comes in and hadnt play much with hes two for two theyre just contributing offensive foul on K roll thats his first just extended that left arm a little bit there yeah theyre going to make theyre going to call that thats going to be automatic when you lift that arm you can dip your shoulder and when you lift that arm thats just an automatic call there lets see if they go to Hinson inside here with smaller defender on wa calls this red when they double on the Block and hitson has his first points 14 minutes in hadnt had a shot attempt since the 1527 Mark 9 and 12 minutes score now as much as he Lov to shoot the re lets see how patient he is to accept it wakes going to switch every screen that he sets and theyre not going to allow him to shoot from behind the threepoint line will he continue to go inside and be Pa kept Alive by Marsh for Wake Forest and the fresh 20 bopy Miller Central Michigan transfer seventh weight for S and hes a guy thats been struggling from behind the threepoint line shooting 28 in conference play but here at home peing off this crowd and wait knock down seven threes here early and so again on the Block hild tried to co a foul Diaz BR moves it to the corner for Carrington no dice and Carrington has started 0 of five all from threepoint range feeling good they knocked out his first couple after hed been sh for 15 his last seven games from long range and its a pick foul Way Forest has Pittsburgh spread out right now and when you spread out this way theyre able to drive the ball theyre getting in the paint theyre forcing rotation and when the bigs have stepped up they dropped it off to Marshall Reed and when theyve been caught him in rotation they just knock it down threes lets see if this changes things for pit Will jeffris comes into the game and we mentioned in the first meeting this guy was huge Off the Bench defensively with rebounding with energy the last 9 Minutes of the game he knows what he is is he knows hes in there to provide some toughness on the defensive end and some Music rebound and the same role that he was down the stretch in that game as the five they got a mismatch over there with Ellie put Leed with Marsh and low cant hit Marsh the rebound need that 13 for Wake Forest inside a 4 and 1 half to go in the first half here in Winston s trying to take advantage of car being inside of the post 611 he had low on him Salis navigating Jeffers Ono shot clock at five and car double clutch hit needs a bucket yeah its not a good possession on the offensive end there for the decks and see if pit can take advantage of it theres a good side for the Panthers and is Leed who was massive like we said in the first meeting with a season High 22 and he had four triples wake was unable to set their defense there difficult shot there by Carr and pit pushes in transition wakes unable to get their match ups the LA tipped Away by Carrington but a foul is called and Jeff cable cannot believe it so the lead

couple teams tied for fourth in the ACC and with NCAA tournament implications as well its a quad one game for pit they already have three quad one wins this year and a quad two game for w heres boy Miller driving on low and they got tangled up the foul goes against pen on the floor great job there by Boy Miller just driving putting pressure on the rim again throwing a foul on low its his second Jeff C hasnt been pleased with a handful of calls here in the first half Pittsburgh struggling to contain the dribble right now they cant keep the ball out of the paint and theyre giving up everything theyre giving up threes and theyre giving up layups because of it Miller 84 at the free throw line hey tomorrow nights mens basketball matchup right here on acc network is PJ Hall and Clemson AT mamish Pavilion against Georgia Tech with coverage starting at 7 Eastern how about some of the games elsewhere in the ACC tonight Florida State you saw earlier right here on accn an eightpoint win in Tallahassee against BC and Syracuse went into Raleigh and got what eight threes from Chris Bell in a win over the p therere home more away they just so difficult to win this time of year carington no and hes 0 of six from the floor now second leading score for the Panthers at ACC freshman of the Year candidate Sal is up top and the Finish plus the foul for Andrew Carr just a great drive there just getting in the paint again pit cannot contain the dribble right now when its costing him dearly just an easy drive there b Carrington is late on his rotation cant do anything the foul car says thank you Ill take that and one so three pit starters now with two fouls of piece as well Federico low and Carrington who does stay in the game for Jeff cable and the Panthers down by 15 now Jeff went spinning and the whistle is on the floor against wake Force wakes going to be in those gaps and if you spin you got to know helps coming theyre doing a great job of gravitating to the Music ball theyre feeding off this crowd they know defensively when they get out in transition right now just Pits on the heels right now where do he go for pit for offense you got to go to Hinson you mean try to figure out now the matchup and he cant get frustrated with this with the smaller guard on him and just go inside like hes doing that if he doesnt get it go to the rebound get frustrated here he was banging with hildr and looks like the foul was going against him off ball as he continued to jockey with Cam hildr and thatll be two on Blake Hinson as well as I was saying again cant get frustrated and wak thr a really good job H just doing a really good job but trying to deny him the ball and you can see what hes saying to kinger is that theres gesticulating from cam H and that his argument is dont High into that do you see a shove there though yeah you saw him extend again hes automatic when you extend that left arm its its an automatic foul and again you see it again hes extended the left arm I know hes frustrated hadnt gotten a lot of atts hes not as involved in the game as he would like and when youve been playing as well as he been playing and scoring the ball at such a high level you want more touches and its difficult W committed to him defensively theyre not going to let him control this game he was good in the first meeting he wasnt nuclear right and on the flip side cam Hilder you thought defended him pretty well also well because cam knows he has the advantage on the on the perimeter and when he goes inside hes going to get helped theyre going to double and we talked about this at shoo round I mean for Hinson its about being patient theyre not going to let you get five or six threes off theyre going to switch on the perimeter theyre going to force you to go inside to try to take advantage of the your size and when you do theyre going to double you like it got to be the guy for pet right now with the foul trouble hes just so embraced that role coming off the bench he gets to come in with that second you he plays starter minutes so it doesnt really matter but hes as tough as they come hes a gamer and with Hinson out hes going to need to step up and carry a piece of this load in the offensive ENT for bit Carr gives it up and now HRI driving again on Austin who commits a foul so again what youre talking about with the pit breakdowns defensively just stopping the ball they cant contain the dribble they cant stop the ball Wick getting wherever they want up dribble and its forcing them in rotation and if they cant you cant stop fouling and you cant keep the ball out of paint its going to be tough to get stops they cant get out offensive end on the transition so theyre just struggling right now with their defense Sunday womens basketball not today takes on Bon college at noon and then its number eight Virginia Tech against North Carolina 530 Eastern number six NC State against two and this just way course its just a different team in this building why you said the role players why else those guys are comfortable here and everybodys more comfortable at home you know and they they play better at home theyre feeding off this crowd and theyre these are the rims they shoot on every day in practice and you just see a team thats getting after this team has been solid defensively for the most part all year they just had finished games on the road when theyve lost and here they hadnt had those issues theyre undefeated at home and you see why Carrington connects and 18 and2 minutes in Bob Carrington has his first points at some point you want to see him getting into the paint as well hes a 66 point guard want to see him use his size and get in the paint and start forcing rotation you see the effect of it because its was happen to the Panthers on a defensive end the floor coming up on the final minute of this first half hild downhill and they turn it over and this is what coach for talked about with HRI he wanted him to one or two dribbles get off of it he tends to force it a little bit and sometimes gets those turnovers right now your offense is clicking the balls moving dont over dribble just keep it moving and just be ready to attack pit whos been making too many mistakes on the defensive end Hilder playing with a BM rest those last few weeks leged no Diaz Graham finds Austin he got foul he had bad intentions on his way up so heres pin I mean hanging around they trailed by as many as 16 but theyve gotten some timely threes here these last few possessions and they got a chance to trim this to 10 right now in the final minute of the first half they do when they were down 10 and a half you know at their place against wake so thats the number you want to get to get it to 10 and theyll get in final possession here in that game at first meeting a few weeks ago Jeff Cables team trailed by as many as a dozen so 12 thats their largest comeback win this year so they want to come back tonight and win that would be their biggest come from behind Victory this season you have your home is doing the game and no matter what the score is this team is going to compete on the defensive end the floor right now they got to contain the dribble and get stopped so they can get out in transition trying to stay in front of Miller here gives it off to Salis the early threes for him Carrington on him defensively Salis slicing and he gets the roll this is the guy I mean he just scores in so many different ways hes up to 10 Steve Forbes takes his use it or lose it well take it as well back in 30 mercedesbenz of South

ACC on display we talked a lot about Hinton lets focus on Hunter Salis cuz hes got 10 and the conversation around this week program and staff today when we chatted with everyone was them wanting to see Hunter sales be the alpha demand the ball and just go assert himself in games and I think what theyre talking about too is in in the guts of the game when it matters the most its last couple of minutes of a game when they need a basket they want the ball in his hand and hes just more of a laidback player and lets the game come to him and for this team to start winning on the road hes going to have to become that guy the hate Im going to give you the ball and take us home everyones prepared to lose and win with the ball in Hunter Sols hand car came out on Carrington Austin hoist cant hit Salis got it off there they got it to go so the first half concludes with wake up and does wake just got whatever they wanted the offense been before control the paint which allow in the entirety of the ACC winners of five in a row and seven of the last eight Hansons open off the shot fake he rises and comes up empty boy had a good look at it the start he did although cam hilds made a great job of just running out at him at the last minute forcing him to put it down and reather himself and P he missed that one badly 91 threepoint makes this season for Blake Hinson leads all power conference players hildr navigating underneath boundary hes fired in foul trouble and only played Seven Minutes in the first half just took go away this game is gone the digs get the ball in the paint off the bounce and pit cant control the dribble forces rotation if you dont rotate re finishes or Mar finishes if not they kicking it off for three hon tries to take Salis to the block Reed helps out out of a double its tipped Away by Carr with nine to shoot this what youre talking about its been breakdowns defending the ball hildr finds himself underneath and an easy hand on well maybe not so easy yeah I dont know if that was an assist or maybe just throwing it but things are gr your way its going to go in a scorebook as an assist were going to count it as Los got to get it in and he does the hints in deep one was online offensive rebound Austin those are the threes that they want hon to take from the low go hin is going to have to take H with ins establish himself inside the post and force the to double allow his teammates to knock down thre so they can get back in this game and hon was just barking at one of the officials Kip Kissinger saying all night hes been doing that is what hes trying to get bad postentry from Salis Zack Austin picked it off federo underneath back out for Austin still cant hit from three oh of four and hson got it back and got fouled G POS a problem with long rebounding you got to hit a body and box out Chase it down and Fon Reed picks up his third foul early and and I know hes frustrated because hes about to come out of the game but he goes back to that very first one he has to do a better job of protecting his first foul and now he doesnt have to play the game so timid what did you think of Matt Marshs minutes in the first first half I think hes been his numbers wont show if hes been as important a player for the decks because there hasnt been any fall of usually when that Reed goes to that bench theres a significant drop off for the deeps and Marsh has done his job hes hes screening hes rebounding the ball hes finishing when its given to him around the basket and right now with pits ability to contain the bounce containing the ball off the dribble then it doesnt matter another shot with over carington Hunter Salis with a dozen heaing the message from his coaching staff coming out of that loss in Charlottesville on Saturday Music 4947 Henson on a face up muscles in Step through but couldnt finish drawing the crowd there hes got to kick that out this is a game hes going to have to play more like a point guard he is theyre not going to let him beat them Miller always good about playing off two feet Carr had it blocked by feder Rico and then Carrington walked the tight rope its a hard thing to do when youre in a Groove like he is Austin had a little awkward jump there wanted a foul and couldnt tip it home and Miller converts the other way great job by Miller pushing simpo there using the speed and full court couple of panthers didnt get back wake had numbers critical moment here for the Panthers they got to set it out and get a good possession here Dix are rolling in the offensive end got Rico underneath draws a Applause foul I mean hes a blurred here CES have qu no one stops the ball and easy layup there by Miller in the boopy versus bub Bos had the upper hand I mean hes played well with a dozen after you mentioned his scoring had been down in the last handful of games teams coming off back Tob back road game when they lost theyve just been a different team here at home and all of these guys have done the whos played better cars played better so is bopy Miller and for a guy who started out I think shooting the three ball so well thats thats not his strength which you just saw him pushing in transition he can do that as well as any guard the ACC splits at the line the last couple of trips from Hinson and then there from feder Rico wake by 16 H Carr wanted it instead a dribble hand off from Marsh to Miller probing and fading away hints in the rebound Austin ahead of the pack attacking couldnt finish legot follows got it out to Hinson cant knock it down and H since 0 of three from Deep one of seven overall I thought that was one of the better shot attempts that hes got just in the flow of the game without trying to force Marsh the Finish plus a foul looking like the Matt Marsh from last year no drop off tonight Marsh has stepped up all night coming in chiping in here with another and one for the decks decks rolling here in the second half up 18 Music mercedesbenz of South

seeing each other as equals and treating each other with respect and dignity at all times recognizing that our differences dont divide Us but make us stronger and great shirts from the Panthers as well pregame so we welcome you back to Winston Salem for Wake Forest is in control early on in this second half and Matt Marsh stamps a threepoint play and if pit doesnt do a better job of keeping this ball out of the paint this could get ugly fast mean the first 4 and 12 minutes of this second half theyre still unable to contain the bounce keep contain the ball off the dribble and they dont they dont do a better job it is this good ugly Play Wake is shooting 60 from the floor hits at 29 Carr commits a foul on the floor and thats the way Hinton has to play there just know that the double teams coming dont force shots play as a point guard turn around face it you see the double team coming coming find the teammate and then theyre going to score again both these teams at 8 and six in the ACC and NC State at home lost earlier tonight against Syracuse and the fighting Chris Bells leet couldnt knock it down Henson follows it up so you say hes got play like a point guard in some ways did that and then hes got to be a bully on the boards too what happens is again you got a smaller defender on you so instead of forcing it playing on the perimeter go inside you dont get it you win the battle on a glass like that youd like to see them get to that early but they got to get to it now and this is the end of the footage got to fix they got to guard the ball hinsons on Carr get switched on to Salis who hits another third three for Hunter Salis seems to be some confusion there if they were switching or not Hunter Sil involved in the screen youve got to switch low lost his footing around the corner shoveled off to Austin underneath slip back to Diaz Graham pit bench wanted a foul didnt get it follow it for legit and it rolled off boy Hunter Sals been very good tonight Ultra efficient 15 on just seven shots Miller top one its just a theme of the night I I I feel like I can just record it play the game just beating your Defender off the bounce getting in the paint it just cant stop the dribble and anytime you know team can just get to the rim whenever they want its going to be difficult to defend them credit the weake first meeting pit defensively did Force wake into a lot of turnovers 15 of them got a bunch of stops especially in the second half low bump Salis in transition and thats about the only thing that has slowed down Hunter Salis tonight well I I think hes always been efficient he shoots 50 from the floor he just doesnt Force anything everything comes to him with ease hes just so in control he cant speed him up and this is the McDonalds All America that Gonzaga thought they were going to get and now game is slowing down for creditor Steve fors and the staff just giving him the confidence and the platform to to show what he can do and I know you said to the conversation we had in the first half about him being an alpha that thats related in part to end of games yes but its also throughout the game because remember what Steve forb said to us a shoot that he went back and charted it Saturday there was a 16minute stretch of game action where Hunter Salis didnt attempt the shot he plays the right way so when you scheme him Fredick in another three is third he plays the right way so when you scheme him he doesnt four shots so hell go 10 minutes without a shot if youre trying to take that away from him and you just want him to be a little bit more aggressive to assert himself in a game oh everything coming up wake low in there with three fouls cant hit hit nearly have the offensive rebound but wake runs Monsanto pulls hits its

total control and they have just changed toari mon Santos transition shot from a two to a three it looks to us like thats absolutely the right call was there ever any doubt never Ste inside he has one 2 point shot of the Season were going to question that now you kid me it was never a doubt thats a good point Shooters know trust me mikee shooters know yeah youre right and he truly has in nine games this year only attempted one twopoint shot wakes on an 110 run and theyre getting production from everybody they have its just been a little resistance here on the for a team thats been the number one team in defending the threepoint line in the ACC tonight they just struggled against guarding the ball when you dont guard the ball you know theyre giving up everything theyre giving up layups midrange shots and threes and what do you like most about what youre seeing from Wake offensively youve talked about the the pit defense side of it but what about for Steve Forbes group offensively I dont think they get enough credit for how they are defensively theyre not a pressure team in a defensive end in the floor youre saying for Wake defense for Wake defense if theyre sitting in they pressure you once you get the ball but theyre offing gaps helping out a dribble and offensively nothing surprises me just time because I think theyre one of the more scar offenses in the ACC the question for these guys is just particularly in this building they have to be able to take their show in a road thats the next step for this leg it connects its a long two for ish Leed hes got 10 for the Panthers joining Jaylen low yeah thats been the Bugaboo for Wake Forest this year team that started out 3 and0 in the ACC was on a niname winning streak at the time first time those things had happened since 15 years ago but just five and six since since then and again all six of those losses have been on the road and four of the five wins are at home heres Carr with a shot clock winding down he lost it and a shot clock violation thats about the only thing thats gone wrong for the deak here in the second half that offensive possession there offensive execution was at the Forefront of Steve corbes mod coming out of Charlottesville and of course he said some of that is Virginias defense but he said some of that was us too and some guys who maybe disappeared a little bit at TH was part of what happens at times with with this team I think in games like that thats what we talked about when we mention about Hunter Sil and being an alha metal theyre going to go to review on this

Salis with 15 poopy Miller with 14 and you mentioned Hunter Sals background as a McDonalds AllAmerican who started his career at Gonzaga Steve forest was telling us that when he went out there out west and visited Salis at Gaga in the portal he could tell that Salis had lost his confidence said he could see it in his eye contact and now you can see the way his confidence is on the court and his personality back looking like the guy who was so decorated coming out of high school thats one thing I can guarantee you if youre going to play for steeve fors hes going to give you confidence hes going to coach you on the defensive end Flor but on the offensive end hes going to give you the ball and let you play you was never a doubt about Hunter Sals Talent just getting confidence and when you go to a program when he committed to joh zag they were as good as any program in the country hard freshman to come in and crack the lineup and you lose confidence when that happens to you Hinson with his first three here were talking with wake assistant coach Demetrius Nicholls and he was saying to us at the end of sh round yeah I would have loved playing for him in this offense who wouldnt I can imagine I mean everybody if you watched him play Im talked to my son about that and hes upset he said if I had had a CO year I would have come back and played with Steve for Santo got crushed by Diaz Graham screen and heres Henson maybe he starts to heat up for pit comes up short Monsanto the rebound pit just seems to be a step so even there theyre not theyre not lining up matching up offensively got to watch yourself here youre starting to settle some shots and they take a high volume of Threes but if youre going to take contesta threes like that you can get run out of here quickly one for seven from three but Diaz Graham had to follow it up couldnt get it to go hild pushes in transition got fouled by Carrington is third hey our next gymnastics meet right here on accn and the ESPN app is Sunday as NC State squares off against pit at its Gerald Fieldhouse coverage starts at 4 Eastern we were talking about Ken Hs injury earlier to his right wrist chat with him after shoot around we said hows the wrist he said still broke hes playing through a ton of pain and he went into detail with us about the injury the swelling that followed the pain that hes still in I mean this a guy who is playing for a sign ific injury and he told us he did consider having surgery but knew that he couldnt bail on his team down the stretch hes just such a big part of his team and their identity he provides a tremendous amount of toughness and hes their best defender on the perimeter and hes also was helping me with my industry Im going to call him BR I call him BR he said that if you heard it take one word with his accent it would probably be BR yeah like bro yeah you know if youve watched Ted last heres jayen low drivs a foul uh poopy Miller is first you Ted Lano guy have you seen the show no thats okay that all its really good yeah check it out 1026 to go with wake up by Applause 24 and PCH has to be careful here on the off offensive been the before you take you still got to execute your offense and got to be extremely disappointed in what youre doing credit towak theyve come out even now e res on the ball but theres no driving Lan everybody sucked in pulled in theyre looking to rotate and you go one on four another offensive rebound for pet and Le it makes the decks pay hes got his third three hes got a team High 13 still 10 minutes to go in the second half legs been the only guy for Pittsburgh whos really been on his game in the offensive end of the Applause Flor Harringtons out on hild Reed trying to post up the sophomore from Spain G mod Diaz Graham commits a foul thats his first got to love that match up for the DS just obvious size advantage that they have inside with e you dont have to attack the paint off the dribble there you now thats what he provides also on the offensive end youre able to drop the ball inside so let him play a little oneonone inside Miller a hand off and its a block uh will Jeffers Ws got a lot of pieces weve seen them all contribute in this one its kind of what theyve been waiting for this year with Reed getting eligible in early December the Mari mon Santo coming back a month ago to the day and still evolving as a team into what the full compliment is going to look like one of the things you get about manant is just him getting hey you know as he comes back hes had back to back significant injuries and I dont you know as coach for today where is he from a percentage stand point he thinks hes about 80 so with a guy like that coming off your bench a proven shooter and scorer you know the more confidence he gained just adds to the the bench production theyre starting five as good as there is in this Applause Music lead almost a year ago to the day for deari mon Santo coming back from that patella injury in his knee theres also some MCL damage in there steeve Corps has said a harder road back than they thought it would be because its a second significant one to your ailles before that and he come he came back amazing I mean his you know from that injury and that seems to be reputation wise the hardest to come back from and he came back so fast and tend and some other things inside and he still slowed him down a little bit came back on a minute restriction and hes still trying to figure things out and getting in game shape and hes kind to pitch count right now lead at 23 for Ray pores low around the Jeffers screen too strong off the window and Carr runs down the rebound its hildr Frederickson Miller Reed and Carr the five for the Demon Deacons wa just doing a great job of just changing their defense that time they were in drop coverage low came off expecting a hard hedge and it wasnt there took an off bound at one L and then Miller just navigates his way to the basket for two more just resistance there guarding the basketball there again its getting to the rim is just a theme of the night for the de on the offensive end of Flo theyve gotten whatever shot they wanted because of it Carrington got fouled by Andrew Carr I want to go back to ball screen defense that you were talking about because weight has changed its ball screen defense from how it was earlier in the correct me if Im wrong they were heavy in drop coverage earlier in the year and now theyre doing more things in addition to that like Blitz well theyre trying to mix it up because you got to figure out a way even now because they got to figure out a way to keep e Reed out of foul TR so when hes in the game youre trying to keep him in drop coverage to protect him from fouls and You been unable to do so in guards when you in this league theres so much great guard play that you cant allow these guards to get inside and get in the paint but you see the DS are doing the offensive into to the Panthers and so now youre changing it youre hedging youre doing different things and you got to figure out a way though to keep him in out of foul trouble he he he needs to play more in games and his team has another level to get to and if they want to get to the NCAA e Reed has to be on the floor to be for the de to be a part of achievement low DRS of Frederickson fouled yeah after the Duke game Steve corbes really got on Fon Reed hard about foul trouble and if you look at the advanced metrics about where Ws defense ranks this year preread and postread its significant theyre around 200s in terms of where they were without him the first seven games of the Season theyve been a top 20 defense with him hes a shot blocker and again hes physical inside does a great job for a big guy he communicates well he anchors his team inside and he has to figure out a way I think at times you want to tell him to concede a basket if you need to they need him on the floor if they want to make this final push on these last few games after Reed needs to being uper 20s of minutes and hes got to help coach Forbes out in that and eliminate some of the fouls just like the one he picked up tonight they had to take him out early because he picked up an offensive foul coming up on 8 minutes to go after low knockdown both free throws Miller backs it out and Reeds calling for it again going to work on feder Rico Federico and a left hand hook for Fon re hes got that in the back who goes over either shoulder but prefers that left one but shows you he can go over the right one with the left hand as Music well low kicks to the corner for Carrington Yanks it back knocks down the jump shot in the midrange second bucket for bub Carrington who averages 13 a game and you and I were talking about coverages in that that time in drop coverage you dont need to hug up or rotate as much inside and that time boopy Miller could have stayed more towards his Defender I mean his guy instead of rotating in as you would if you were hedging a ball hon bangs with HRI and gets tagged for an offensive foul his third frustrating night for Applause P that is must TV give her the ball are you kidding me and its a tie game he Dr it I cant believe what I am witnessing the streak Liv it for the wi no when you have a history of greatness you keep dreaming and go beyond whats possible the new 2024 Ridgeline passport and pilot part of our most rugged trail sport lineup yet from Honda this time belongs to those who want it most the rivals the statement makers 70 points 70 you want that shot

and number five Tennessee takes on number 10 Kentucky boy if that doesnt get you going I dont know what will experience the Blockbuster triple header today on ESPN the rush to the playoffs the biggest games the biggest stage the Stanley Cup Final Returns on ABC and ESPN plus this time belongs to those who want it most where youth is tested in great are challenged the playoff push is coming the time FY Winston Salem and obviously not the way pit wanted this night to go but still five games left in the ACC after tonight and still opportunities out there couple of quad 2 games that come around a game at Clemson quad one on Tuesday still got a quad 2 game against NC State at the end still opportunities to enhance this rese still very much alive and looking like to the it test an NCAA tournament caliber team the last month whats the difference between these two is that Pittsburgh has the quad one quality wins that youre looking for and the beaks are still looking going to get that and you know this was a more pressing game for Wake for they had to have this game you know you look you cant get wake couldnt get caught with the D coming to ATT Fon Reed with the slam yeah I mean we told you earlier pit is three and four in Quad one this is a quad one game also for the Panthers but already three of those very good wins whereas wake just with one quad one win this season youve gone into Cameron youve gotone into jpj to get wins hild in transition pushes for wake and finishes its a great possession there defensively by the DS on one end the four turned into Quick offense Music and the DS was playing like they had to have this game which they did and theyve done it on both ends of the floor theyve been really efficient on the offensive end and I thought theyve been really physical here as well on the defensive end read the rebound off the legged Miss yeah you had said that earlier that you thought this game was more of a mustwin for Wake for pit yes one is because if pit wins this game tonight I dont know how with their remaining schedule that how way could get back in front of pit because they would have swept him and we talked about pit has the the sexier wins the quat one wins and the deeps have been theyve lost to some of the top teams in the league and theyve beaten beaten the teams at the bottom need to HRI with the follow away and this is as large as the lead has been for we yeah I I agree with you Henson draws a foul probably thinking to himself finally hes been frustrated tonight so thats whats left for pit meanwhile for Wake theyre going to have Duke come here on Saturday and that will be another huge game for the Demon Deacons so you see what remains for them then its at Notre Dame at Virginia Tech quad one game at the castle and you still have Clemson out there as well so you mentioned they dont have those sexi wins that pit has got a lot of opportunities theyre coming and it starts with Duke at home and this place will be rocking this crowd this is a different team here and then when you travel in the road thats where we got to see this team has got to close out games on the road but they want to make it to the tournament its just as simple as that and its going to start with at Notre Dame which going to be a tough place to play and I think that Virginia Tech game is going to be Big Y thats going to be one of those games I mean when you get when youre running out of games here each one within its own becomes the most important game that youre playing and tonight was that pral day one t night theyre taking care of business and defending home court has not been difficult for the deakes this year but they get those backtack Road games at Notre Dame and at Virginia Tech they need to try to come away with both those cam H by the way had a little blood looked like on his hand that needed to be tended to hes a tough guy let him alone leave him out there nobody makes me bleed my own blood my BR my brothers out there giving it disolve thats enough out of its its a trap on Hunter Salis got it free to booy Miller shot clock below 10 for Miller finishes that was smooth what do you know another layup how about that hes been living at The Rim he has done a great job of that and he does that as well as anyone plan off for two feet but like we said the theme tonight its just been a little resistance from the Panthers credit to the de everybodys contributed theyre having their way Music Henson drew a foul on cam hildr is second Thursday night 10 Eastern after our womens basketball double header the nothing but net crew breaks down the day in the ACC with highlights and Analysis from every game and they look ahead at the best matchups on the schedule in the coming week thats right here on accn and on the app one and one for Blake Hinson six 67 at the Applause line Miss is on the front Applause Music end usually youd say in a game like this how much longer would teams play their starters but with the metrics playing such a big part of that you cant clear your benches you got to play it through now Fon Reed and the hook pop out yeah scoring margin we believe to be capped in the net but efficiency is not and thats something coaches have become aware of the longer we have had the net we get a foul on the rebounding action here that goes against bopy Miller and thats two on him so yeah it matters in a way that you wouldnt have previously thought of that your offensive efficiency your defensive efficiency still matters regardless of whos in the game and at what time of the game and what the score the game and I wish thats something we would change because theres nothing better than having a game like this and and then the guys who practice as much as everyone else those WalkOns are such a big part of every program they dont get a chance to play in games like this now the metrics are robbing these kids of their opportunities even coaches you dont want to do that when teams have off nights theyre all have been there you know course sces doesnt want to be out here there but nearly 30 and still have his starters out Applause there yeah no question weve had coaches in this league tell us that they feel guilty they havent been able to put WalkOns in the games because they are aware of how it could affect their metrics when youre either getting blown out or blowing somewhere out and again this game is indicative of what were talking about because theyre two teams that are fighting that are right outside the bubble and theyre fighting to get into to the tournament and and its in a game here where youre sitting here up 29 Points contemplating whether I can put guys on the end of my bench you deserve and theres not many games youre going to win in conference play like this well still 409 left fig well see some stuff well see some I would imagine 30 point spread with four to go low a lob corner leing off the shot paint got it to go 15 for ish Leed he is stayed in his Zone in his space tonight hes been the one guy thats been efficient just hadnt seen much resistance from the DS from him they had had much to guard him he been to go when we come back during this black history month we will talk about a legend here at wake fors when you have a history of greatness you keep dreaming and go beyond whats possible the new 2024 Ridgeline passport and pilot part of our most rugged trail sport lineup yet from Honda we want it all we want beards and lattes great we want to be invited great and not attend great we want to take the

history month we focus on Charlie Davis who broke barriers first black player to win the ACC Player of the Year award back in 1971 still has school records here at w for dropped 51 with no threepoint line back in 1969 exactly right three seasons in the NBA and one of the best and a guy who played a big part once you got here of helping you adjust to this place yes and he still lives here and Charlie Davis knows how much he means to me and and uh he just helped me navigating when you first get here you lost and uh he just kept me focused on a lot of things and he was one of those people that I reach outside of the coaching staff that he and Dr Yuri were just special people that help me navigate wake as AfricanAmerican men and and I looked up to those guys and I still do to this day when I get to a point in life where I make major decisions in my life I still go back to these guys and discuss those things with them so Char Davis is a special special man in my book and I know I wouldnt be the man that I am today without him I have the childrens family is forever indebted to Charlie Davis its beautiful bub Carrington for three from the corner coming up on the final three minutes here at the Joel in Winston Salem if youre just joining us wake did Stretch A Lead out as large as 16 in the first half and it was really around the first four minutes of this second half where they pushed the lead into the 20s and they have never looked back Sal up top for Reed hes got a dozen wak just do it does a great job of making you defend every area of the Court when they stretch you from Deep with range from behind the threepoint line getting to the midrange area finishing at The Rim just going to force you to score Salis clears the Austin Miss yet this has been way coming on all cylinders on both ends of the floor it is and this is about as good as they look knocked down the 10 triples and from the floor hitting at 63 high low to car and he finishes from Fon
