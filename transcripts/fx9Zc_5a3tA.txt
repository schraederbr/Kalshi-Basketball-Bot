bouay Moma will jump Center against Quinton post it is won by the Eagles and we appreciate you joining us here on this Thursday night for BC and Lehi and the Eagles 8 and three overall eight2 in the nonconference to begin the season Jaden Zachary to the Lane kicks Devon mton open three a little short and a rebound comes down to Tyler Whitney Music Sydney same starting five for Lehi in each of their first 10 games of the season now alen Sinclair that are running the point here of late Keith Higgins Jr is the guy to watch first in the Patriot League averaging more than 17 points a game and hes on the board with this first two you didnt go out too far on a limb there Eric to say that keep an eye on that guy but that is the story get it going early if youre lead high and thats a great sign of things to come but post thought about the three instead driving against Dominic perin knocked out of bounds it will stay here leehigh under Dr Brett Reed whos in his 17th season at the Helm of the mountain ax 264 wins hes very realistic about where his team is right now they come in with a record of 2 seven leehigh does not have a division one win this year but if you look at the schedule theyve played its been pretty impressive theyve played some challenging opponents and its all about building towards the right time of year as butell Harris Jr hits and they been in a lot of those games against the likes of a Providence against in North Carolina for a little while under 10 points against Penn State played a top 80 schedule in the country this year theres Moma inside against mlon tried to hand it off for Whitney Sydney but couldnt quite find him this is Boston College under third year head coach Earl Grant coming out of that St Johns game last time out he said hey Im glad we won won the program needed it yes it was a neutral sight game in Brooklyn but it had that true Road game feel having to play the red storm in New York City Aris feeling good early missed the three yeah that was one of those that you know every wins are built differently sometimes its not like this Boston College program has not had big wins they knocked off a top 10 Virginia team just last February so its not completely forign but it felt like in that moment considering that the Eagles were down for a bunch of minutes in the second half can considering that guy Quint post only had one point in the second half for them to dig out get a win against Rick patino and St Johns felt like a big moment for this group wins are built differently and players are built differently and for post he can impact a game in so many different ways on a day where he had only 14 points its a luxury for BC to be able to say hey only 14 points out of post but to come up with 11 boards nine assists most of that coming in the second half thats huge that is a huge building block to win a game six of those nine assists came in the second half against St Johns post again backing down perin got the pass away mton theres that passing ability that we talked about with Po and mlon draws the foul he has the ability to just see over the top of everybody and this is what were talking about with nine assists and it was really interesting talking with Earl Grant that he said you know you look at the line for post 14 11 and N right if that was your point guard and he put up 14 11 and N youd be blown away youd say thats one of the best performances by anybody this season its just the fact that post is used to being around 20 points where you said maybe thats a little bit of an off night but based on the matchup against St Johns and the pressure that they apply he went to quintum before the game said youre going to be our point guard tonight and he took that ran with it and boy did he ever Rick patino has always played that press through the years and the Eagles handled it relatively well so 32 in the early going after the mton one of two at the foul line the foul is against Jaylen Sinclair Higgins got rid of it perin who can step out was in and out on the three perin whos 22 threepoint shooter this year here is post once again its a definite size Advantage there inside but he moved his pivot but a traveling violation against Boston College B chahar into the game for Lehi whos played a lot more here recently he only played 11 total minutes the first two games of the season but has had 10 plus in every game since more and more impactful re Reed really likes the way hes seeing the floor of late yeah and this is somebody who has grown his role not just this year but year overy year because the last two seasons Eric he played Just 40 1 minutes total and now youre talking about someone that is getting up into double figure minutes per game this is the Lehi team by the way that has 10 guys that go 10 12 plus minutes a game this season Sinclair spinning against Harris little handoff move and the put back no good from Tyler Whitney Sydney finishing around the rim and in that restricted Arc area is huge for Lehi they miss at one end they give that up at the other threepointer for Harris who has five of BCs six in the first four minutes Bell certainly looks back and healthy for Boston College in the early going aryn nowhere to go Whitney Sydney on the dry blocked by post Whit who averages over two blocks per game is third in the ACC in blocks Harris thought about it again claudell from three what a start for MJ Harris 39 threepoint shooter this year and already is knock down two three straight games out of the starting lineup including a dnp due to injury Id say hes back Eric H another block at The Rim stopping chbah Applause Music hard all of a sudden a nine nothing run here for Boston College after High had the games first two Harris again Harris got Applause it P check for Applause FJ its a 12 nothing BC run with 11 of those from Claude L Harris Jr Higgins to end the Run no and Quinton post who already has two blocks two rebounds and an assist remember for claudell Harris yes hes lighting it up but its a PA of blocks by post that have set up those threes post inside now kicks to a league Bay on the drive against Sinclair skips around Zachary with 10 to shoot one more time yes and a Time Le Applause High yeah because you watch these three pointers and these are open so those are the first two and then like you say the heat check starts kicking in and then this ones not only covered but deep as well the fourth of the four straight triples for Harris Take a Bow absolutely see how many career points hes got this rate he might crack a th yeah he was he needed 28 today to get to 1000 he is halfway there mhm so well see how Lehi adjusts as at some point Brett Reed just had to call a timeout and kind of reset 15 consecutive points for Boston College since Higgins had the games first basket chabahar falling away and ends the run so first two from the senior from Marietta Applause Georgia you were right though I mean as much as Harris and what he did on the offensive end but it a lot of those possessions started with post and his blocks theres El Bay inside nice move to basket for Prince El Bay a sophomore whos averaging just under seven a game yeah 67 but hes got the width hes really got the ability to Shield the defender once he got that half step on him there was no recovery to try and affect that Applause shot Higgins way out guarded by a Le Bay with 13 to shoot Zachary off the floor right now theres Higgins creating short from three off offensive rebound though perin was matched up with the leag bay and got the inside position for his first two a couple of nice plays by chahar whos 68 perin whos 69 so for for Lehi theyre seeing threes go down from the outside but theyre still taking it to the inside Jazz Kellys in there for the first time for Boston College he started in Harriss spot the last three games and he has F going to the basket back to Prince El League Bay we were talking with Earl Grant before the game and where he feels like Prince is right now and he said you know hes still pretty efficient even though the attempts arent a ton right now and hes getting the basket but hes doing the little things as well outside of his scoring and he feels like the shots going to start to come yeah its not a matter of if the shots are falling shooting over 40 which maybe isnt ideal but when you get looks like that right just a quick drop step and youre practically at The Rim those are high efficiency high percentage shots and so for a leite bay its not the easiest thing in the world to be a player and know okay Im going to be on the court for X number of minutes and Im probably only going to get three or four shots here tonight I got to do everything else right to stay on the court Elly missed two but an offensive rebound for BC ason Madson Donald hand in there for the first time heres hand on the drive right to the basket and is averaging over 13 points a game over his last three really has been productive in his role and BC leads 196 Whitlock whos in the game the first year who committed that last foul heres Higgins step back three ball good Keith Higgins Jr whos a 37 threepoint shooter and the Patriot Leagues top scorer gets Lehi back to 10 he scored first basket of the game and has been quiet just as Le lehis been quiet since great couple of passes and M Lockton with the DK it was post first who set it up and then a nice touch pass from Kelly to find Devin mlon his first bucket of the game well one of the big reasons for this offensive surge of late is some of the production Off the Bench specifically Donald and and Mason mson who have really stepped into their roles Earl Grant was talking about it a lot this year finding the right rotations but feels like Madson and hand have kind of carved out a roll from each other and the numbers have followed suit here especially the last three weve already seen Han grab a bucket in this first half but for Madson hes been quiet so far and just limited action Off the Bench but for Madson nine of 13 threes over his last three games and thats confidence that his teammates know from practice D hand confident looking shot but it was off the mark from three that ends the streak of seven consecutive makes from the floor for Boston College he go still eight of 12 to start this game and Gillis is in there for the first time the first gear for Lehi theres jt1 who is rejected a glockton and mighty who are in there right now heres armman Mighty the sophomore got the chance at The Rim but missed it was a pretty good look and did everything but go down he was tight roping a traveling call but instead sprung himself to right in front of the Applause Music tin the has worked the timer down if you look at their numbers for the season not taking into account the two games against non D1 team they rank 13th in Pace this year year now some of that has to do with the opponents theyve played as you see the block from M Lockton but theyve gone out but so far today they feels like theyve tried to slow the game down a little bit more the early go yeah this this maybe all things being equal is the speed that Lehi wants to play right that at a certain point you can play up to your level of competition but theyre a little bit more of a halfcourt team and uh turn over there by 10an yeah got it inside but Mighty took it away and off for a leag bang and long two that was strong and out of bounds going to Lehigh well the record is what it is as weve talked about but Brett Reed feels like they are building theyve been in a lot of these games a couple of them even feel like they had a chance to maybe go the other way their most recent in two against division one competition lost by one at home to St Francis and then lost by five on the road at UNBC in two wildly different games 6261 to St Francis 9287 to UNBC one of the fastest paced teams in the country Hern tied up and foul goes against Boston College second foul for the Eagles in 10 plus minutes although the eyes only committed a pair themselves I think most noteworthy for Lehi okay so theyre preseason number two in the poll right Colgate is the prohibited favorite they return a ton of talent but this is going to be a one bid league as we stand here today in mid December and theres a good take by Joshua Ingram the first year and he draws the foul the Patriot League by and large it is a one bit conference regardless no matter the year its pretty much going to be a one bid league but its not short on talent because take a look at moves like this and Ingram the body up and muscle through some ACC competition at this stage of the Season theres only one Patriot League team inside the top 215 of the RPI and that is Colgate but theyre right around 100 so there is no scenario where anyone but the team that runs the table in the Patriot league tournament is going to get into the tournament here his hand off the rebound and matsons miss and Donald Pan Jr finds a bucket inside he has Applause four quickly down the other end theres some Pace High Dominic perin has Applause four so considering the start its basically been an even game since that point leehy maybe even outscored Boston College since theyre up big off of the Harris makes inpoint game right now Madson twisting Falling Away Mason nson know and the rebound Carolin finds it as he was falling down kept it going without the travel and the mountain Hawks have a chance to really get closer in this game Moma falling away no quite have the look so for BC without Quint post on the floor right now Zachary bounce pass for Mighty into a double team mighty goes up strong and his foul there was a lot of really good defense being played by Lehi there including a block up top but simply too much contact when its all said and done its an aggregate of just fighting through all the reaching and perin was there he had the ball for a moment and mighty just wanted to make sure he got his chance at the line almost end up being a triple team some ways there mighty mighty the sophomore from Toronto put on nearly 20 lbs of muscle in the off season hes about 6 minutes per game so far this year he makes that last free throw claudell Harris Jrs back in along with Quint post a 10point BC lead so Lehi held with Poston Harris off the floor keeping the score around 10 aary nearly got a steal but its a good take by Tyler Whitney Sydney for his first two yeah largest lead 196 so a 13point deficit cut to eight post find inside for Harris taken away by Gillis good read that post likes to distribute there is perin off the feed from Whitney Sydney and now its its Earl Grants turn to call a timeout well Boston College who had all the momentum in the world but Lehi on a run right now has cut this to a Sixpoint game in the Precision of healthcare do well is they take the ball away they are first in the Patriot league and turnovers forced and a good job of reading that post likes to distribute from up on top of the threepoint line and thats what sets up this play yeah it is and for post we highlight the career high n assist last game it comes with three turnovers but with that that confidence brewing for somebody who we seen make a couple of really good passes and then maybe you try to squeeze one too many into a tight space and it turns into a turnover so the run right now is 127 in favor of Lehi theyve made four of their last five from the floor post backing down again to distribute and the pass from Zachary is knocked away itll stay here with eight on the timer really nice length there by Ingram just keeping his hands active and coming up with a threepoint play at one end and a deflection at the other Harris little fake falling away well colonell Harris certainly brought his game today 16 points already for the junior transfer when you drop 14 points in just a couple of minutes and then you go five minutes without scoring you think whats wrong there is mlma against a leak Bay illis against hand nearly lost his footing under five to shoot herin inside and that is an offensive out he was kind of losing the handle on the ball anyway that was a hard shot right to the chops haris is just waiting for him thats as basically fully lost the ball by then yeah its as easy a call and charge as youre going to Applause Music get Harris is six of seven from the floor to begin this game there is post tried to go wide on the pass qu post really looking to distribute right now time looking for Donald T yeah because at 7 foot he had someone whos 51 guarding him and uh if your post when you pick up your dribble you could have just shot it up over the top of him you got foot of clearance ready to shoot Zachary driving in a little short and mlma has the rebound UB mlma whos taken a jump this year in his sophomore season threepointer from Whitney Sydney no good Lehi as a team shoots 32 from behind the arc make about eight threes per Applause game oh little floater for Zachary Jaden down the Baseline nice move first two for Zachary its his game his ability to drive inside other end moment no with the left hand against post ability to drive inside get his nose in there for rebounds and come up with some steals as well it is back to 10 Donald Han Jr for three no good haris read that really well but couldnt quite find the rebound tring to get to the offensive glass rebound was grabbed by Junior Ben kotzman instead good take Whitney Sydney has four that ends a two plus minute scoring DRFT for Lehi and back to an eightpoint Applause game out call them the strip M against Music post so when Zachary gets this ball its a clasy double team hes got a sliver of room in the Baseline and then beautiful English off the Music glass post found a loose ball but couldnt finish it the rim so quit an0 for two from the floor in the early going yeah still scoreless the high on the Run Corner three is good Jaylen Sinclair and lei is as close as theyve been since that two nothing start Applause after Boston College scored the next 17 it is a fivepoint game and a foul called against post away from the ball all the momentum on the side of the mountain Hawks right now and the frustration mounting for post just too wide of a base there thats the call wasnt necessarily moving but when youre 7 ft you cant have your leg spread that wide to try to pick off the defender first on post fourth on the team with 444 to go here in the first half another kick to the corner three ball chevar that wasnt close well defended by mton going out to the corner Harris nearly lost the handle on it got the pass away to post but it was a little behind him out of bounds knocked off of Jaylen Applause Sinclair even in transition hands bother that shot then the hands bother the pass and then back to real action a contest of a jump shot bothers that glockton was well short so 2823 is the Boston College lead and theres a Applause strip Harris guys certainly paying attention to him now heres post spinning inside and a blocking foul is Applause called post spun at just the right moment to avoid taking a charge Momo was trying to get himself in position but you could see that that contact came off the side of the body so right idea for Moma to try to stop this guy and you see the spread stat line here the real it is last four games post has been 18 points or fewer the four games before that he was 20 points or more so it is its an evolving role for post right now as they get closer to conference play here is Harris got inside floater with the right hand no post the B and the first two for Applause Quinton a league Bay with a nice strip Eagles getting back to their game Madson steps into a three ball Mason medson good hes averaging 13 points over his last three and nine of 13 from behind the ark one of two today to get the lead back to 10 important stretch there for Boston College Five Points in a row after Lehigh was on a 17 to9 run Sinclair slips in ins side Whitney Sydney no follow no and elik Bay has another rebound four rebounds in the early going for Prince elik Bay Zachary inside for post and quick post to the bucket and leehigh will use jmy the a great job by Timmy Thompson is dad mad whos worked in the ticket office for a long time here at Boston College its fun to see a lot of the kids are out to students are gone of course cuz finals ended earlier this week so we replaced them with the kids you better not take a bathroom run at halftime Timmy could hop right in there we would miss take our chair yeah he wouldnt miss a beat b chevar at the free throw line and he makes the first so this has been a game that when it starts the way it does with claudell Harris going off the way he did and DC having a 152 lead it certainly feels like its going one way and you give a lot of credit to Lehi for hanging in this game as long as they have getting as close as five at one point its a 10point game right now yeah and it it doesnt feel as if Lehi emptied the tank even though this lead has grown back to double digits it doesnt feel as if they made their one run and BC is just going to put him away the rest of the night thats inside good take of the basket from Joshua Ingram who has five yeah it really wasnt one like seven or eight nothing run it was kind of just beating you know in 4minute segments there for Lehi and hanging right in this game Harris got around clell Harris a little strong that time offensive rebound though Jaden Zachary for three is good so five for Zachary whos not taking nearly as many threes this season as he has in years past only attempting about two a game where he was about four attempts a game last year playing more of a true point guard role this season but he still has that shot when needed jabbaar nson got a piece of that ball and its out of bounds to BC it has certainly been the claudell Harris Jr show for Boston College so far today four threepointers all of them in the first 4 and 12 minutes of this game yeah ex I mean we were talking about an 11point lead for Boston College you take away one of the best 4minute bursts by an individual player in the last decade of BC basketball and lehis got this thing tied up but instead claudell Harris did what he did that was a nice little burst by Zachary there who follows the three with two so he now has seven the Eagles have reestablish a lead here to 13 long three from Josh Ingram no good and BC back on a little bit of an offensive run here five of six made in a row from the floor and Harris going to the line theyre giving him two shots I wasnt sure if they were going to say that was on the floor and its a one and one but its going to be the full two Harris I like the fact that to begin the game like you said Eric did it with threes he was four five on threes right out of the gate but now hes taking it inside putting his head down and and trying to create offense in a little bit of a different Music Applause way B chahar is back in the senior Austin College which has generally been a good free throw shooting team this year 77 1 12 though they struggled against and St Johns but were able to win in spite of Applause it coming up in the half today well check in with our ACC Network studio highlight stats quick chat with both coaches Harris good again what a first half for claudell Harris Jr 18 points Boston College career highs 22 did that earlier this year at Vanderbilt or feel like thats going to be updated here is Higgins Falling Away pretty good look there from Keith Higgins that ends a little bit of a BC run which was 7 nothing over the last minute Zachary quickly to answer nine for Jaden and its a 16 six Boston College run 17 of 31 from the field for the Eagles here in the first half over 55 Music shooting and a final look here for leeigh BC led by as much as 15 Lehigh cut it to five and BC has it back at 15 now chabahar lost his footing but was fouled so he will go to the line with 51 seconds remaining in this first half only nine free throw attempts this season for chabahar six of nine at the stripe this is someone whos in his third season at Lehi after beginning his college career think not too far from here up in Brunswick Maine began it as a polar bear up at Bodwin College it was only the six team foul on Boston College it was the second on Mason Matson is knocked out of bounds by mton hindsight great foul to give 5 seconds left now side out really creating problems for Lehi to get a good look here to end the half because as he was we were talking about he lost the handle on it before the foul so thats why he was called on the floor nice pass inside for Higgins couldnt finish though what an excellent look from Whitney Sydney but Higgins could not finish at the rim and BC has its largest lead of the game after all that for him CL out by the way also just 10 points from a thousand now in his career its funny coming in you say Okay 28 points away well hes only had 22 in a game once this year not no way hes getting to 28 well well mark it down just in case but not really worry about it and now we are certainly on a thousand watch as M missed the jumper to begin the half remember Lei made the first basket of the game and that was 15 points in a row M locktons three is good Devin mton it was just three of 13 from behind the arc this year but got a good look there and he has six yeah Harris sucked in two Defenders that made it a wide open look got an assist on that as well second assist for claudell Harris Higgins had seven to lead Lehi in the first half here is perin inside against Zachary Dominic perin will go to the line and this is a look at Harris drawing two Defenders they bump into each other and there wasnt a mountain hawk in the screen when mlon te that up if youre defense youll gener generally live with a mton threepoint attempt but obviously set up very well there perin has seven and now eight after two made free throws his last two games his scoring had been down a little bit just averaging six points a game over his last two after averaging 11 first seven games in the season for Lehigh Harris around the screen fast ball over to Zachary in the corner with Sinclair right on him and a foul goes on Lehigh and Sinclair thats his second course repeating you see on the screen Lehigh is 2 and seven on the season their only two wins are against non division one opponents they have been in just about every single game this season expect them to really grind it out and fight for every last B bucket here in the second half you know it was interesting talking with Coach Reed this week and you see some of those games obviously St Francis and UMBC stand out as certainly games in those that could have you know won basket on the way oh CL could not finish off the alleyoop and it Springs Higgins out front and then a whistle and a foul and count the basket as well so a potential fivepoint turnaround the other way for Lehi after post could take the alleyoop off the inbound yeah this is a wide open just about as easy as youre going to get it and then back the other way the help by Harris and that is clear go 10 the foul was against mton and that is they are reviewing the goal T but anyway just to finish the point its hard to even put it into words but when we talked with Brett Reed and you know the first question fairly obvious its hey in your words where do you feel like you are right now even though the records 2 and seven and he felt in the way he spoke about it extremely secure and trusting of the plan and I think you need that when youre as you talked about a little bit earlier you talk about the idea of a one bid League building towards conference play and thats really what counts as the season goes on were not outcome based were process based we might be able to influence outcomes by making sure were doing all the right things offensively and defensively but our guys are committed to the process thats what their head coach had to say earlier this week on that 2 and seven record in a team that going into a holiday break theyre looking for their first division one Victory this season and theyre better than Applause that theres post T to shoot after the threepoint play at the other end Zachary for three that was halfway down and then a foul on the Applause rebound and that is Devin mton and thats his third foul in a short sequence here well Grant will leave mton in Thunder 2 minutes into this second half 47 34 the lead for Boston College they have led every minute since they were down two nothing good take by Whitney Sydney he has six for a guy averaging nearly 14 a game to all Patriot League guys returning and Whitney Sydney and Higgins were responsible for 40 of lehis points last season Whitney Sydney is somebody that his coach described as incredibly athletic for our leue lead and its even on display here against the Eagles Optimus three post spinning inside another one thats a pretty good move but just does not go down but in this case post straws the foul heres a look at Whitney Sydney how about this for a first step lowers the shoulder and slices in with just a great bit of body control and then speaking of body control po wanting the threepoint play instead settling for a pair of free throw Music tries Burke jebar back into the game for leehigh weve talked about it the idea of post and all the different things that he does and even on a night like tonight where the points have not necessarily come easily but four rebounds two assists and remember on those Harris threes two of them were off of two blocks from Quint post some big moments Sinclair inside nice strong take five points for Jaylen Applause Sinclair post got it no doubt that time Applause off of Jaden Zacharys second assist Whitney Sydney inside tough take no Aris the rebound and out on the run for BC left it behind for Zachary gives it right back for Harris his three is good threepointer number five for claudell Harris which is a Boston College High one short of his career high for threepoint makes of the game yeah and and for Harris that was all set up really well but the defense recovered that wasnt as wide open as it looked like it was going to be for him Arn couldnt finish at the rim with post defending and again MJ Harris out of the Run why not that one short now five of seven from behind the ark Zachary nearly out of steal and before the long distance barrage from Harris its the inside work by post and then that transitions into Harris and look at the recovery defense that left hand gets in there for Higgins Jr but too much MJ there for Boston College claudell Harris Jr who goes by MJ his middle name starts with an m and then obviously the junior thats how you get MJ hes been known by that for a while wild thats what the team calls him after missing Central Connecticut due to injury and coming off the bench the last two games but back healthy and starting today and what an impact he has had 21 points on five made threes Kelly tried to fast ball but it was knocked out of bounds on the Baseline by Whitney Sydney which sends us to a Timeout on the floor 5338 Boston College lead over Le High I just want to clean up the foul situation on Boston College they had originally given Mason mson two fouls in that first half but they changed it at the table to one and reassigned it to mton and then mlon with two quick ones in this second half so thats why he has three now and mson has one so thats the clean up three fouls each for both teams in this second half mson stepped out of bounds appreciate you joining us here on this Thursday night students who finish up Final but some of them have stuck around really nice turnouts considering a couple days before the holidays obviously the 600 start a big fan of the the start begins with the six Sinclair inside hand off perin lost the handle on it that is the seventh turnover on Lehigh as Kelly running the point right now for Boston College with Zachary off the floor and Chaz who started three games in a row for BC with Harris out injured and then coming off the bench did an admirable job especially in that St Johns game as a held ball possession will stay here you see the look on madsons face he drove base line he had it in his mind Im going to Dish this off the defense never collapsed he could have just taken it all the way in again you just see that body language just knowing probably didnt make the right decision there no reset here so six to shoot post had and stripped again Lehigh does a nice job taking away the ball and a three ball was well short from Jaylen Sinclair in transition everything was set up for a made three now two and a half minutes without a point here for Lehigh pass inside for post and lost the handle there so both teams a touch sloppy Applause here and for post off of the entry he absorbs a couple of Defenders now here comes the help he is the Focal Point Lehi wants to take him away from the offense seven points on three of six shooting Id say theyve done just about that Whitney Sydney is fouled on a threepoint attempt and there is the second foul on Mason Matson so Whitney Sydney is a 63 threepoint shooter well get three here I dont believe its contact on the arms so what we saw there there wasnt much if anything but it was Madson not allowing Whitney Sydney to Applause LAN see if we can get a wider view here so no contact up high well well saw his foot go down it looked like on that second angle his foot went down before but it its sometimes tough to tell in Music slowmo I understand Mason madsons gripe he Sydneys up to eight points now now Henry adasa the sophomore from cameroons into the game for the first Music time and three at the line for Whitney Sydney and Lehi is close as theyve been in a little while see has managed to keep them though at arms length most of the way here the guy got as close as five at 2823 in the first half Eagles on a good run from there post good move left hand against the inexperienced sophomore and Quint post takes advantage with nine yeah adasa is a student from Cameroon came over in High School to California and hes a work in progress but great size great athlete and at least this year I should say he actually played a little bit more last year average 13 points a game this year only four and a half points a game heres that move from post just a little bit of Wiggle around him in the post area and thats about as good a move as weve seen at the offensive end from Quinton post here Applause tonight f ball went past post to mton his threepointer no good that is good from cam Gillis who found an open spot on the floor walked into it knocks down a threepointer one of the Freshman for Lehigh theyve got four of them that like to see time in this rotation if youre playing well the Freshman stay in this is a veteran older team for Lehi theyre not a team that gets plucked by the transfer portal this is a group thats been together and so for Lehi a great spark from a FR done a decent job keeping Boston College out of the paint I think just in general this is a lower scoring game than what Boston College is used to certainly what theyve been of late post is fouled and thats two in a row on adasa guarding Quint post this has definitely been one of those games where post is had to work a little bit harder to get his points we talked about contributing in other ways as well five rebounds two assists two crucial blocks very early on in the game but four turnovers frustrating aspect to the game tonight for post where he could almost do no wrong against St Johns scoring setting up teammates grabbing rebounds Zachary tried to floater for post it was didnt quite have it timed up right post pointed up he wanted the lob a little bit behind him so couldnt quite go up and get it we already saw post back rim a lob attempt earlier in this Music half chabahar looking to hand it off for Gillis comes back to his left leehigh did good job setting some screens there and Higgins was open but couldnt knock down the three Harris passes the three instead drives and a new Boston College High 23 from claudell Harris he cant help but smile right now got a little something going on with that left leg though on the landing he is smiling but maybe part Grimace as well Gillis another chance at a three thats no good and its out of bounds off of Lehigh which sends us to a timeout well Harris up to 23 points in this game what an effort it has been for the Charleston Southern transfer stretching looks like he is getting some handshakes there hopefully is okay this is the as you talked about just came down a little awkwardly there kind of stretching out the whole time is obviously still on the bench right now well see if we see him again hes at 23 points right now to lead Boston College and Eagles lead is 57 of 44 and whats been a lower scoring game than both these teams have played of late Donald hand in Donald hand is Off the Applause Mark Applause Higgins kicks to the corner chbah hard no good from three rebound it was Zachary and Ben kosman the junior whos in there for the first time in a while played a few minutes in the first half but back in there now Lehi has really gone pretty deep down their bench today this is something that Brett Reed talked about with us he felt like depth was a strength of this Lehigh team and he felt like coming into the season its not something thats blossomed its something that he thought 10 Deep was going to pretty much be the number for them out of camp and that has proven true theyve gone 12 ft today Jaz Kelly inside against Ingram just never really had the angle there but Higgin stepped out of bounds yeah the reason they go 12 deep here today is because they need bigger bodies and theyre trying to cycle in somebody that can be a little bit more effective against Quinton post down in the blocks and all things considered again post is still at nine points and five rebounds heres a lob for post the catch the put back maybe maybe not perfectly as designed I think they were hoping for an easier finish on just an alleyoop but post made it work wont make sports center but counts the same for two the alleyoop that they tried to convert didnt go Im sure theyd much prefer this one jebar steps back off the Higgins feed and no good from three Lehi is just three for 19 from behind the ark tonight yeah you dont go into an ACC opponents barn and Come Away with the win if youre putting up numbers from Deep like that Kelly thought about going back to post on the pick and roll but instead takes it himself and its going to line with 108 remaining here in the second right and thats no real knock on Lehi youre going to have Knights like that over over the course of time but it just comes at a a tough point because theyre doing a lot of things well but if you even go six of 19 which isnt an overwhelming number its really just your season average okay all of a sudden this is a five Sixpoint game Eagles now six of 11 from the foul line after that a kind of been an odd here at the foul line for BC I mean statistically theyre still one of the best teams in the ACC from the line but have had a couple of games where theyve really struggled but theres two for Music Kelly yeah theyre 21st in the country that turnaround was no good from Whitlock but it finds cam Gillis after that conversation with Brett Reed so Gillis has five HEI trying to find their way back in its hung around this Point Boston College is led by as much as 18 leehigh cut it to 11 at one point in this second half it feels like theres a run to be had but the Eagles have continued to prevent it yeah just coming up with a bucket every few minutes is a just a great recipe to maintain a double digit lead Kelly for three that was s we talked a little bit earlier about the pace that Lehi plays with number of attempts and Bret Reed actually thought a lot of that had to do with their opponents that they played this year UNBC one of the fastest teams in the country they played North Carolina who plays pretty fast Cornell is a pretty fast team as well so he felt like that was more about that than the way that Lehi is just going to play but you see those numbers there in terms of the hemp in the game much different game here today yeah so if you take those numbers right extrapolated over the time remaining youd be kind of right about 60 field goal attempts in a game so youre say six uh fewer than what you normally attempt but the real uh crunching of numbers comes in the fact that there are only nine free throw attempts as well so its not just the fewer field goal attempts but its if you take the trips to the free throw line and how many fewer possessions are being held in this game uh it really speaks louder to the pace of this one compared to what Lei has been used to well theres first points in a while as Higgins knocks it down he has 12 of Course Lehi has gotten threepoint attempts just have struggled from behind the arc tonight post inside tough take and he is Applause fell its a frustrating fourth foul on Bou MoMA just because post wasnt really in a position to make a great drive to the basket he was fouled yes but per post its not as if there was a lan to be had but he has a sense on how to create contact and how to get a defender in a spot where all they can do is foul K mton back in for Boston College replacing a league Bay went post who is an excellent free throw shooter 84 this season and you know all things considered just cant hold him down for that long he down 13 points in this Applause game remember eight from the floor and hes knocked down three of his fourth free throws he was held scoreless until the 5minute Mark of that first half so so its been a definite charge for post as hes picked up where Harris Jr more or less left off game starting to get a little choppy here theres a bunch of fouls on some of these drives that foul goes against Jaden Zachary thats his second and both teams now are shooting the one andone am Gillis the first year from Falls Church Virginia that really excited about his quickness and what he could bring to the table talked about this group of First Years with Gillis Whitlock with Ingram havent had a ton of opportunity yet but its coming it feels like more and more and there were flashes from Ingram in that first half for hes looked good hes up to Five Points which is the most hes had in a game against a division one opponent in his young career Music lell haris back in there by the way for the first time heres Donald hand for three and then a foul on the rebound attempt with mton getting tied up with nir Whitlock the first year tough size match up there for Whitlock its 62 against mton its almost one of those dangerous hook and hold situations really for Whitlock he just trying to leverage himself in any way possible but blockon with Incredible size not just the height its almost 60 extra pounds Lockton continuing to do the little things seven rebounds seven points Applause now Boston Colleges lead in is is 15 again weve talked about it it felt like the eagles havent quite been able to pull away and Lehi hasnt quite been able to go on the run to really get back in it as we play at 15 points right now which is where it was at Applause halftime obviously time against the mountain Hawks right now there is Whitlock for three that was halfway down Higgins got a rebound and finishes Keith Higgins Jr with 14 points now Lehi puts a little bit of press on Zachary breaks it well kicks to Harris another three try is good that ties his career high with six made threepointers and he is now two point shy of a Applause thousand 26 tonight for claudell Harris Jr Higgins lost his footing and does get the timeout what a night for MJ Harris six made threepointers on eight attempts 26 points to lead all scores tonight points and now ties his career high with six threepointers yeah just been an incredible performance it came right out of the jump and when you score 14 points out of the games you think okay what could the rest of the night really look like it it looks like a whole lot more of what its started with and so yeah he started with 14 points but he scored 12 more points since then thats right and and so I mean this is a guy that is just locked in and having a great game no matter when you slice it and nearly had a steal there and then Higgins was halfway down on a three that didnt go so 6852 Donald hands slipping inside against Whitney Sydney and Donald hand will earn some free throws we step aside once again 6852 Boston College the lead over Lehigh notably the recent win against St Johns well think of your Boston College the part thats most encouraging is the year youre chasing that 056 season and the year that youre ahead right now 0809 are two of the last three times youve made the NCA tournament so for Boston College an ACC right now that is projected to be right about five bids according to Bracketology DCs ninth in the conference in rpis theyre in the discussion thats bottom line heading into the bulk of conference play and thats all you can hope for through the Eagles here is Sinclair inside tough take and hes fouled well that was what Earl Grant said at the beginning of the Season he said we dont know quite what its going to look like yet and what the conversation is going to be yet but we want to be in whatever conversations there are to be had in March and in this nonconference theyve given themselves a chance to do that if you win tonight youre 9 and three you could be 120 right now after a win tonight potentially and youre still going to have to win tough games in the ACC otherwise you are not making the NCA tournament so their future is still ahead them they havent hit any stumbling blocks where you would go Ah thats going to be tough to explain in March so good on the Eagles as they look to close things out over the over the last 6 and A2 minutes to your point its kind of a doubleedged sword with the ACC this year your school like a Boston College and zakary with a nice turnaround on the one hand its not an elite ACC so as you talked about it doesnt feel like a year where its going to be 7 8 n teams in although you never know but on the other hand it feels like top to bottom in this conference there does not feel like a team that this Eagles team is not capable of beating and that is as much of a positive as you can say about where this program is right now well lets look no further than UNC and Duke coming into the year tops in the polls in this conference but right now number 102 67 in the RPI step aside for 30 seconds the Eagles on a little bit of a spurk here to build the lead to 21 okay get this right and you get my free ticket to tonights game right who is my alltime favorite receiver larz yes Larry Fitz Larry fitzer I heard you got an extra ticket to the game tonight I would love to go yeah sure its its all yours Larry thanks Billy Ill meet you out front what yeah okay its Bob but okay yeah even know your name dude I guess Im Bill now with Vivid Seats when you buy 10 tickets you can get your 11 Music free so Brett re used the timeout there after for 91 run for Boston College to build their largest lead to 21 heres whats up coming for BC a little bit of break now for the holidays and then they will enter ACC play at home on January 2nd against Wake Forest well have it for you on AC Network before heading on the road for three in a row at Georgia Tech at Syracuse which one earlier today to finish 9 and three in the nonconference as well and then at a Clemson team ranked 18th in the country there are of the teams that are ranked in the ACC right now which is Virginia Duke North Carolina and Clemson Boston College only has each of those on their schedule once now Miami whos receiving votes this week the Eagles do have twice sometimes the luck of the draw in the schedule the way it works but it is interesting again with UNC and du you know how talented those teams are but they havent performed to their level in the nonconference so 102nd per UNCC in the RPI Duke 67 hey you got a schedule that we just showed you Clemsons two in the RPI Syracuse is 13 so in terms of building a resume the Eagles in the next couple of weeks theyve got a chance to really bulk up their schedule another steal here for Boston College Lockton sends it back over for post Quinton backing down kosman kicks to the corner a leak Bay open for three is no good that almost went right to post on a pass the way it skitted off the rim the foot back was no good Duke did get a big win yesterday at Madison Square Garden over Applause Baylor now goes against the league Bay his third so leis not made a field goal here in the last 3 minutes and kind of similar to some of the games that weve seen against Power five power six excuse me opponents this year for the mountain Hawks where they were in it for a while we talked about in the second half it was a game that it felt like the run to get back in it wasnt really there the run to put the game away wasnt really there but then that 91 spurt by Boston College kind of gets the lead out to at the time 21 20 at the moment after one of two of the line for Music Ingram they its been for Harris trying to again for three claudell is good and what 000 career points for Claude L Harris Jr on a career high seventh made threepointer and its just been so efficient for him seven of nine Beyond The Arc just incredible stuff 10 of 14 overall from the field and to be precise 11 career points with now 29 in the game post nice little move boy it has just has not been there tonight before Quinton post on some of those footb backs he still has 13 its not like hes played a bad game by any means just had to work hard to get his points as we go under four minutes here in the final game of the nonconference for Boston College second to last nonconference game for Lehigh they will play nist on the 30th what a day it has been for Claude L Harris who now has scored over 1000 points points in his college career 29 Points tonight wa until January 2nd to try to get it asz he adds 29 of them today including seven threepointers which is a career high for threepointers made in a game and continuing his excellent stretch of basketball as a key transfer in from Charleston Southern this year started a little slow to begin the season but for someone who was the second leading scorer in the Big South last year averaging 17 game and youve now seen that level of scoring over four five six games now and hes really kind of establishing himself alongside posted Zachary as the big offensive weapons for this Eagles team ingrams three from the corner is good so the first here Joshua Ingram now with nine points backto back games for Ingram with his two highest scoring games of his career 14 against Karen Harris not done yet but in and Applause out nine tonight for Ingram 14 last time out against Karen one of those freshmen perhaps turning a corner as we hit the new year so there are reasons especially talking about those fresh with nine for Gillis and nine for Ingram a leag bay no good at the basket as Lehi with more and more guys playing in this 12 guys deep let a held ball possession will stay down this end and Boston College will make a full line change here and get their starters out of the game hugs and a round of applause for a career high from claudell Harris with Boston Music College his BC high previously was 22 so hes gone for 29 tonight his overall game best was 34 in that same game that we talked about against High Point last year where he made the previous high of six threepointers but seven of them today on 10 of 15 shooting seven 10 from behind the ark what a night it was for Harris JT Tan in the game for Lehigh is Off the Mark after the foul on Chaz Kelly so again Lehi will be back in action after the holidays on Saturday the 30th at Marist before jumping into Patriot league play against their four you know they played Four power conference opponents now after the game today Boston College Providence North Carolina and P State its one of those odd scenarios where team picks second in The Patriot league and you feel like still has a real shot but still will be looking for their first division one win when they play that game against mariis on the 30th right its one thing to say hey we want to be peaching at the right time but at a certain point victories do help confidence and just building some results as much as you want to trust that process here is a is just strong in the game did not have the three but okay to smile enough that is uh 0 for four on the season from there for strong strong a freshman from Charlotte North Carolina eagles found a little bit late in the cycle it didnt feel like the kind of game that was going to get there but still with a minute 52 to go lost college at 77 points with an opportunity to get to 80 and four consecutive games the high putting some of the younger guys into the game here Jake Pike is in the game the first year along with Henry adasa who just returned nir Whitlock is in there Tommy conif the sophomore in for the first time and Jen CLE the senior from Scarsdale New York adasa no good but the followup from Jake Pike is there for the first year its funny it was hearkening back to the conversation we had with Earl Grant for Boston College and you asked about can you sustain 80 points a game he was honest he said I dont know well see but what he was adamant about is I believe if we keep our opponents in the 60s were going to have a real good chance to win every single night and what do you know you go hit 80 and theyve got their opponent in the 60s and it ends a little 10 nothing run for Lehi there is Donald H Jr for three he has nine nice answer as backto back buckets there for Pike and we go under a minute as Boston College looking to complete a nine and two nonc conference Madson good for three Applause we mentioned it earlier this stretch even before this game was the first time that Boston College had scored 80 points in three consecutive games since 2018 as Elijah strong gets on the board it was in a stretch of late November and early December 2018 they scored 81 against Sacred Heart 95 against Providence and over time an 82 against columia and this will now follow up that stretch four games in a row here with 80 points and with this Earl Grant team havent scored 80 a ton but this team feels like theyre capable of it thats now 80 points six times this season the Eagles had 80 scored 80 points six times total in Earl Grants first two seasons prior to this year so I think if you ask him that question before the next home game his answer should be yeah I think weve got a pretty good chance of keeping up this this 80 Point well he did say coming out of the summer and the tour overseas in Italy and Spain the fact that he felt like the offense was actually a littlee of the defense going into the season which is obviously a rarity for his teams which are so focused defensively in his Mantra of course in his opening press conference gritty not pretty which has been embraced throughout the Boston College basketball Community final seconds will come off here and BC finishes the nonconference 92 theyll go into the new year 9 and3 overall after an 85 69 win over Lehigh Applause Music tonight
