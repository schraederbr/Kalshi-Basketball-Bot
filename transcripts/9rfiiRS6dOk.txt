a terrific run in their own right yeah the Tigers all the way to the regional final losing to Alabama 89 82 in Los Angeles we are underway NC State white black and red Clemson in the traveling orange and regalia purple detail on the uniforms terrific match up at point guard with Zachary and oconnell as well middle Brooks straight away three ball kept alive inside Styles come from the weak side after the Miss yeah very athletic good job working on the glass that time I dont know if thats the shot that you want coming right out Middlebrooks only is now one of nine in the conference shooting threes tigers by percentage are the best threepoint shooting team in the ACC Chase Hunter is number one in percentage in threepoint shooting this is shefflin theyre going to be very deliberate in their offense deep in the shot clock Wiggins turns around and hits good high low feed that time Chanty Wiggins sophomore from Grayson Georgia game high 16 points at Virginia Tech that was the most recent game that was last Saturday and a win on the road for the Tigers they are 4 one on the road in ACC play as we start the afternoon and thats and thats where your title run really it begins and ends on the road you know you take care of business at home and Clemsons always been tough there coach brell 282 wins that is the most in school history if he wins today it would be win number 450 Up and Under middle Brooks taking it inside for two well and thats thats the type of aggressiveness you want to see with Middlebrooks leave that threepoint shot alone take the ball to the rim Clemson with a record of 17 and four they are tied with Louisville as we start the day for second place in the standings behind Duke sheflin misses weak side o how about you know Brad Brown Allen and Kevin Keats two of the Elder Statesmen in the conference now coaching wise along with Leonard Hamilton Kevin Keats in his eighth season as Styles steps back and styles rips the ropes early for NC State well we talked about at the open what he did against Duke and you know I think that offensive rebound gets him early got him in a little bit of Rhythm as Mike mentioned top of the broadcast four of six for threepointers for styles on the road at Duke to tie a career high for makes they just need him to stay out of foul trouble in this game locking against middle Brooks on the Block the turnaround snuffed out by middle Brooks and no double team help coming locking had all the time in the world oneonone inside terrific defense flip it to oconnell middle Brooks against lockin on the other end both bigs playing oneonone inside middle Brooks forced the shot up fight for the loose ball might have been Styles coming in on the weak side picking up the personal lets take a look back at that Mark of a fighter moment brought to you by Modell yeah just oneonone keeping your feet keeping that vertical playe nice job and then down the other end lock and return the favor and just some good oneonone individual defense in the Applause post pressure from NC Applause State Tigers working on a fivegame winning streak theyve won three in a row on the road one of the other things NC State needs to do is create some easy offense get some steals get some points in transition Tigers had a huge win January 18th at pit 7875 in overtime Zachary stumbling got the shot away for the Tigers he was very fortunate I he I didnt know he was going to be able to gather and get that shot up at The Rim its been such an important ad for this team but mostly on the defensive end of the floor Zachary who played three years prior in the Boston College Applause program Connell launching from prpo Real Estate got it right back on the work by Middlebrooks collects the entry gave it off that was Hunter coming over the top to get a Applause piece Hunters Defender fell down couldnt capitalize Middlebrooks volleyballs it to oconnell shefin tried to knock it away I might have made up a little bit more space if not driven the ball if I were hunter that time he settled for a long three with his man on the ground seemed but I mean early on here Tom weve some offensive rebounding for NC State not usually a strength for them shot clock is out to seven for Hill the leading scorer this season for the wolf pack on the drive thats what Id like to see them do in this game get into the pain area theyve got some you know decent size that guard and Wing that three right in front of the pack bench from Wiggins thats what they do this is a really good shooting team Chanty Wiggins Mike shoots 40 from Beyond The Arc hes made his 31st three of the season this is a team that averages over nine made threes per game for the Tigers third best of the ACC and thats the one big gap statistically on the year that they would have against North Carolina State shot clock is deep again right down to five for Taylor had it poked away zacher potential two onone shovels it to Hunter lines up a three just a great run behind that time on the break Hunter knew that he was trailing had nobody defensively in Zachary aware of where he was career three number 182 for Chase Hunter the graduate student from Atlanta Georgia 55 made threes on the year to lead the club middle Brooks over Wiggins yeah had a bit bit of a mismatch that time got the switch knew he had the side has and the ability to just play right over the top of Wiggins It Feels Like Mike that middle Brooks has come to play against his former team today just a little bit of extra motivation lock in Taylor uncontested rebound for NC State not a bad threepoint shooter throw behind that time Hill spin it Hunter got a piece it ends up with Taylor thats a three too strong Zachary up ahead walking trying to run the floor couldnt catch up with the pass and its out to NC Applause State what a game so far a onepoint lead for NC State but Chase Hunter knocking down his first three of the game for the visiting tigers on CW Courtside Saturday 167th alltime meeting between these longtime ACC Rivals M and uh you know I think really Brad Brownell pretty happy with what hes seen going to going to the bench now for the first time but he a little concerned about the rust from the week off which is a you know its an aberration from the regular rhythm of the regular season but uh group played well in that first stretch remember NC State on Monday had the halftime lead 3733 against Duke which came out and scored the first 12 points of the second half shot clock is down to seven do inside a little strong work on the weak side to keep it alive that shot did not hit the rim go its going to run out on Brion Applause pass Dennis Parker Jr also in there number 11 he got the misfire from doof but the ball never hit the rim yeah and thats you know in a shot like that its tough to recognize that you got to have some pretty good on court communication so this is Dell Jones to bring it up for the Tigers Jones trying to take it all the way AC btic spins it off the glass well you know with Hunter having an off game against Virginia Tech with the illness he really picked up a lot of the scoring slack so hes coming in with a lot of confidence 13 points in that game pass able to break free Connell talk about veteran players hes in his 151st game this year and the Miss on the jumper from Trey Parker Hunter younger brother Chase Mike in there number two yeah they had a switch inside and they they get it to him but Wiggins is out in the perimeter and they got he had he had ell on the inside on the post and they had to settle for a perimeter shot all the way up ahead that bounces out for Parker Jr I Know It of the easy ones that NC state has to capitalize on but couldnt they still retain possession though so Hill and Taylor are coming back in Mike right here maybe two hands go up and finish it Dennis Parker Jr missed that jam just two total points in the last three games prior to today we will tell people too with Clemson that uh shefin is battling some back spasms and back tightness so well keep an eye on him Middlebrooks series of moves tried to kick it out to Taylor intercepted by Hunter gives it off Zachary middle Brooks gets back to block it Hill in transition Parker junr and he is Applause fouled Ben Middlebrooks with the big play at the defensive end for NC State trailing the tigers by one that game in midFebruary 7877 DJ horn the gamewinning basket with about 10 seconds to go Parker junor at the free throw line looking for a Cable News Network which respects all Americans and you have a new home with news Nation Cy news nation is Americas most trusted Cable News Network to find newsnation on your screen go to newsnation nowcom first free throws of the game by either team with we are tied at 12 inside of 12 minutes to go in our first half Tom worming along with Mike jinsky the AllAmerican from duke along with our CW Courtside Saturday production team here in Raleigh North Carolina so glad that you are with us shefflin trying to get in the offensive flow dribbles into the paint up on the glass and off the rim and end boy he really you know its its fun to see a a guy like that expand his game over four years staying at the same school both he and Hunter such an anomaly these days shefin six points a game high seven rebounds in the win at Virginia Tech in blackburg a week ago middle Brooks turns and shoots shefflin has the board yeah I think uh Clemson would rather see him settle for that jump shot than try to drive the ball where hes had success Miss communication between shein and lockin not a good pass Hill gave up the three into the corner Miss from Parker struggle for the loose ball Jones is ahead of the field and Taylor cant catch up and it bounces out for Jones this is the game of the low percentage dunk for both teams both teams 0 for one in that category underneath up and in its Marcus Hill Jr Mike he struggled Monday at Duke just one of 10 from the floor and four points for Hill Jor yeah both of their leading scorers really struggled in that game score the basket for Hunter on a bit of a runner and hell go to the free throw line well you know you get a a mismatch like that against a big guy just going to put on the floor lock and gave up the Baseline then it was on both situations it was a guard against the big and thats uh thats a loss every time so Chase Hunter to the free throw line the grab student from Atlanta Georgia sixth year in the Clemson program he played over 4000 minutes had an illness last Saturday and only played the last 10 minutes of that game and by the way hes an 89 free throw shooter second best in the ACC what you mean look at these numbers 50 from the floor 50 45 from three and 89 from the free throw line I thats thats Elite shooting statistics at the other end Taylor cant get it to go I mean you know you look at at States shooting numbers not great but they get theyre getting good looks at the Applause basket Clemson for the body of work this season 47 from the floor fifth in the conference locking head position position when he earns free throws Middlebrooks picks up the foul if youre inside you can catch with both feet in the paint thats going to be either a basket or free throws and he you know he really got Middlebrooks in the bad way thats the first on Middlebrooks lock into the free throw line 70 of the season from the strike for Brad Brown Allen his 15th Year all the way to a regional final a season ago and hes taken the program to four NCAA tournaments and four nrts this Tuesday on NXT trick trick Williams teams up with NXT champion obafemi to take on 8wn down under in a tag team match that is sure to be Unforgettable dont miss an all new NXT on the CW Tuesday 87 Applause Central Victor lockin red shirt senior from Russia just enough on that one transfer from C cinnati Mike played three years for the Bearcats last season he averaged 127 boards well and you know you lose a PJ Hall and you lose a first team all ACC player but locking a very nice addition in the middle shot clock is at 10 for NC State and Hill trying to direct some traffic and make his move pulls up does not get the bounce lock an easy board Clemson has sealed off the defensive glass the last uh 6 seven minutes or so NC State just one of its last nine field goal attempts locking inside over Middlebrooks hes been getting good position that time couldnt finish so right now Mike 32 shooting for NC State 47 for the Clemson Tigers out of bounds and two Clemson you know I just Im not a big fan of the onehanded pass and uh you know and middle brush just Tred for too much on that theyll try for the Home Run pass make it Music Applause easy so the applauses for Paul mcneel Jr The Freshman from Rockingham North Carolina who joins the fry stick with the fundamentals is that what youre saying Mike yeah make an easy pass to an open teammate I mean you know sometimes we what do you know about passing wait a second now well thats what I told him I told my teammates make an easy pass to me and Ill catch it and I will and Ill score I will score chy Wiggins unable to score heres mcneel he was impressive last Saturday Mike in the home loss against SMU eight points a season high for McNeil yeah I know his role has been expanding and hes been gaining confidence crowd was he got a little reaction from the crowd when he g into the game they flip it across the Niel its a three and nothing nothing gives a uh pressing a little more confidence than coming right in and knocking down a long three his fourth made three of the Season playing in his 14th game for Paul mcneel Jr the freshman in a big bucket to close the gap to two Zachary has to reverse field send it out to sheelin front Applause rim Hill got it back in a congested area back out to Styles and we work the perimeter for Ry State well he got that amongst four orange Jerseys no way he should come up with that offensive rebound but he did hill almost made the acrobatic shot he is behind the play yeah went down hard on his wrist it looked like Wiggins misses the three shein over the top of ODonnell and its a foul on shefin so shefin picks up the foul Paul mcneel Jr picks up the three ball Brad barell NC State 60 on the offensive glass right now Tom now the thing is theyve only got two points as a result of that but still theyre recycling possessions and its uh you know its extending possessions and its more defense that teams got to play overall rebounds a 179 Advantage for NC State middle Brooks pounds it into the floor mcneel another three and he did it again well you know what right now number two got to be shooting the basketball so uh got to be feeding that guy he had made three threes All Season prior to today yeah well throw that stat out the window hes made two in a row right now shefflin physical you know hes going to turn back over that left shoulder on that side just positions himself gets into the middle of the lane and comes back that way averages nearly a double double this season for Ian shefflin 126 points per game second in the conference at 97 rebounds this long rebound taken by Chase Hunter Hunter leads the team just over 17 points per game one on four Up and Under off the glass Gman wow well and thats you know his threepoint shot sets up everything and when you when you score it well at every level you know how do you defend the guy youve got to give up something and you know he shut down the three it sets up his Drive hes got eight points in the game for the Tigers he leads the way McNeil six leading the way for NC State although Styles adds two more just so very good in the in the paint area especially against Wings Zachary for three what a ball game we are witnessing in this first half Mike yeah well I didnt know the well we expect you know Clemson a very good threepoint shooting team but NC state has continued what they did against Duke three threes made for NC State Steel hiy breeder good hands that Time Jake Hy breeder red shirt Jr 32 years at Air Force before joining the Clemson program shefflin against Middlebrooks this is true oneonone and Jamal Spearman calls the foul on Middlebrooks that is his second heres the guy I mean you go in left and he goes under he avoids the uh the block shot goes and finishes underneath the rim just just really sound basketball but on you know on that play that was a foul that Middlebrooks didnt have to make and that was going to be a tough shot for shefin to convert just let him if if he makes that shake his hand go down the other end of the floor youre watching CW court side Saturday presented by All State youre in good hands Brian oconnell Pat Driscoll Jamal Spearman are officials this afternoon at Lenovo Center here on CW Courtside Saturday see and then the other part of that is thats sheins second foul so hes hes probably out of the game now for uh you know you lose him for four minutes here Bryce herd has come in for NC State he wears number seven in white Ismail Duff is back into the game also trying to set the screen for oconnell shock is at nine Taylor chisels his way into the Clemson D not high enough on the Square but he stayed with it well his first points of the game but nice job staying after it yet another Second Chance opportunity for the wolf pack Jaden Taylor is second on the team in scoring 12 and a half points per game and into the box score in that regard Wiggins Wiggins over the Defenders did not get the soft bounce Styles comes away with it Id like to see him do that more though hes got such good size in the paint and usually an advantage over every guy whos guarding him Styles right now is the leading scorer for NC State in the first half with seven trying to add to that total and he will its all net for Styles well theyre just uh riding him and the Freshman from behind the threepoint line Styles is two for two on threes mcneel is two for three on threes four of 10 for the Tigers on threepoint attempts they try inside shefin a quick move off the glass Mike the skill progression that he has made over his Clemson career is that one bounces out of bounds andc State ball well have more time to talk about number four Ian shefflin as the game Progressive its a tight one a onepoint lead for the Tigers what a great look at that move from underneath the hoop by Chase Hunter 155 games an incredible career Mike see you know you were you were talking about sheff before before we went to break and the thing with middle Brooks foul you know in the foul trouble now that shefle can well hes actually uh and its actually they got him out of the game so he uh he can rest his back and uh more importantly not pick up the second foul so good piece of coaching and thats where locking value comes in and the and one on the other end Jaden Taylor to the free throw line for NC State shefflin on that lson bench for the moment and this is what we talked about at the uh at the top Tom and you and I discussed it beforehand NC State attack the basket get inside thats where youve had a lot you know they theyve been knocking down threes in this game but also you know get to the line get the end ones 77 from the strike for the season for Taylor unable to complete the old school threepoint play NC State near the bottom of the conference as far as team free throw shooting is concerned set 71 is 16th in the ACC theyre doing it with the threepoint shot though NC state has made four of them approaching the twominute threshold of the first half and lockin has a wide open alley and he knows his alleys well you had both wings out in the corners everybody spread out he set a high pick and roll and there was no help defensively he was he was I think he was stunned when he looked around and saw nobody there he hit double digits in the win at Virginia Tech with 11 points and hes got another rebound and a save to Zachary I said thats the value of having him come in through the portal uh you know you you can rest sheflin double team unlock him trying to fight through it and the foul was called on the floor only the 15 foul doof picks up the foul number 33 in white you know well keep an eye on that threepoint shooting Clemson averages over nine threes made per game Mike third in the conference NC State averages just under six made threes per game thats last in the conference Wiggins had it go out of bounds now the officials are conferring and we will stay at the center of the floor Applause shot clock is inside of 10 Zachary gathers and scores just a little bit of a hesitation drill got oon will stand up straight thats your point guard understanding the shot clock NC State was just one of six from Beyond The Arc to start the game theyve since gone three of five as Styles stumbles down and was fouled in the process this is uh neither team is close to getting into the bonus right now so its been a pretty cleanly played first half styles for the 10th time this season to double digits hes got 10 he leads all scorers Chase Hunter has eight thats Taylor appeared to lose it a little bit Mike lost the grip on the way up leads to Hunter and hell wait for reinforcements yeah one on four thats odds are against you I mean it is Chase Hunter yeah good point carving dribble locking over the top to clean up the mess well and you talked about it it is Hunter and all the eyes were locked on him driving to the basket and nobody put a body on locken so lockin now has six points he is a double digit scorer for the season 102 per game oconnell defender on his hip theres Dylan Hunter and now Taylor Just fires it up the indication is that he was inside the ark officials are talking about two free throw attempts coming up theyre going to look at it well Jaden Taylor will be at the line we just dont know for how long well and thats thats a a foul that Hunter is upset with himself at cuz you know goes chasing after it and uh just he tries to pull up here but uh just cant avoid the foul call right there you know and he know thats a thats an underclassman call right there I mean he you know he knows thats something that he shouldnt pick up so Brian oconnell and Pat Driscoll and now Jamal Spearman joining them over at the scorers table and the review again theyre trying to determine if Taylor was in fact behind the threepoint line 22t 1 and 34 in away or if you was inside the line and now there is a slight scoring correction Chase Hunter has picked up his second personal foul M on this play he was behind yeah he was behind the arc you know would help to wear different color shoes than the line or you know wear lighter shoes dark line it makes it a little bit easier to call now the call on the court was that he was filed attempting a twopoint shot so you must have indisputable video evidence to overturn the call which again on the court was Taylor being awarded two free that was that was really yeah theyre bringing in the other official now so there may be some dispute in the indisputable Jam Spearman has joined the deliberation in this litigious situation trying to determine exactly where was Jaden Taylor well either way we want you to stay tuned for todays halftime show presented by Subaru love its what makes Subaru Subaru after review its a threepoint attempt Brian oconnell with the emphatic reversal of Fortune for State the uh home crowd and one bench is happy with the decision but the key mic is lets make the right decision with the assistance of the video replay and it appears that justice has been upheld in this instance and unfortunately NC state has left some points at the free throw line in the first half now one of four Applause we told you as a team they are just 71 thats near the bottom of the ACC in free throw shooting and they did not visit the line very often in the game at Duke they were six of seven from the free throw line they shot 41 they tied a season high with 10 made threepointers and nearly pulled off the stunning upset of number two Duke at Cameron Indoor Stadium just fractions of a second between the shot and game clock Duke has a big game today as well M the renewal of the Rivalry Taylor and Zachary go to the court its going to be against Zachary the trip there good quick hands right there on look that was a really good defensive play by tayor so Kevin Keats has called the time out for NC State right now trailing by three to the Clemson Tigers no team has had a lead of more than coach Keats and the pack has lost seven of their last eight Mike their last win was January e8th here on this floor against Notre Dame 6665 three of their last five losses by three points or less and all ACC games late in the game clock for okell on the drive couldnt find the angle mcneel puts it up and the follow attempt by herd is too late might have waited a little bit too long on that last possession to get something going to the rim 3431 the Tigers going on the road theyve got the lead Chase Hunter leads the way with eight points Don Tre Styles into double digits with 10 for the pack halftime straight ahead on CW on the CW remember our trip to Atlanta last year Mike when coach Damon stmy in his first season got his first ACC win in an upset Victory against number seven Duke so well see what happens today between Louisville and Georgia Tech to follow and its Wiggins out of the locker room for two well I mean you look at that front line with lock and Wiggins and sheflin thats thats a pretty stout tall front line its a lot for NC State to match up against seven points now for Wiggins Connell did not score in the first half he was over for two from the floor this is Taylor midrange but that that was a very memorable game for the CW to have it initial broadcast very first game at Georgia Tech Duke right now number two in the nation taking on North Carolina today thats locking with the jumper Clemson is right on the cusp of the rankings and Louisville with its 10game winning streak number 21 out of the ACC yeah I think that um Duke louville and Clemson are in really solid shape as far as the net goes and uh you know as far as the NCA tournament is concerned five ACCC teams in the tournament last year with this NC State program going all the way to the final four Styles all the way to the Rim second effort had it taken away by Applause locken Zachary slows it down fny talking to the uh talking to the Clemson people that Zachary brings defensively what uh Joe Gerard brought offensively this team as a guy in the portal sheflin lot of dribbling over middle Brooks he took it away and got the rebound so Middlebrooks has two personal files so does Chase Hunter yeah and even with that then no really no real help from middle Brooks let him play man on man shot clock is at 10 for oconnell Hill is behind the line that is wire of the intended target yeah just not much happening on that possession first they just a few passes around the perimeter and uh just settling for three four of 11 in the first half on threepointers for NC State Clemson really uh being very methodical here early in the second half choosing to run some clock grind it down Hunter and locken trying to play a twoman game and Taylor ends up with it for the wolf Applause back just the fourth Clemson turnover middle Brooks bumped in midair by locken as the ball goes out of bounds and stays at this end of the floor lot of contact no whistle there we take a look back Mike at the mark of a fighter moment brought to you by Mello yeah and that was the two of them met midair and locking not bringing the ball down at all to get the turnover Zachary to Hunter Hunter for three rims out Taylor has it on the Run for the Applause pack threee from the corner okono hes got his first points of the game and he really has not looked for a shot in the game hes been very passive looking to set up his teammate over 9900 points in his career almost 500 assists and his 183 of the Season near turnover and now Taylor finishes off the play turnover is two of the last three possessions for Clemson Styles hits it anyway the pass was not perfect Styles made up for it with the jumper hes got 13 yeah and two possessions two threes for NC State and a quick 60 run here in the second half almost 3 minutes without points for the Tigers Chase Hunter trying to put an end to that flips it over the backboard and ends up on his Applause back heres the look this one wide open the good extra pass there and then uh a lot of times a little its a little more difficult when the pass is uh you know offline youve got to gather pick it up but Styles a nice job there hes seeing a bigger basket but I like that defensively you know driving Hunter off the threepoint line make him go to the rim play the twopoint game he cant make the layup Hunter has eight points he is on the tiger bench right now Taylor mismatch middle Brooks on Zachary Dylan Hunter tried to help just enough two strong middle Brooks yeah he had an easy shot got to convert that with Zachary on you Dell Jones locking Zachary Baseline not enough on it another board for Middlebrooks then contact in the back court Jones and Middlebrooks and the foul is against Clemson it is a onepoint game couple of Threes for the pack and they Trail 3837 Chase Hunter is the leading score on the season mic just over 17 points per game mostly a clean game overall but a couple of loose possessions last few by Clemson turned into threes for NC State now the Tigers have missed their last four shot attempts NC State working on a 60 run nexts to a couple of threepointers and NC States really really been conscious of driving uh Clemson off that threepoint line Styles and lock and wrestling for the rebound andc State basketball referees letting both teams play inside a lot of bodies line on the floor and not a lot of whistles locking spending a lot of time on the Raleighwood lockin has eight points in the game for the Tigers this is Hill hopping through the paint miscalculates the angle Dylan Hunter with the basketball Dylan Hunter got the start at Virginia Tech a week ago three points and a rebound brother Chase came in for the last 10 minutes after an illness kept him out of the starting lineup shot clock inside of 10 Jones Taylor rushes it up needs a safety valve finds it in Hill yeah Hill not a great threepoint shooter but really does a nice job inside and NC state has taken a onepoint lead after the bucket by Hill struggles for the Tigers continuing although theyll keep possession of the basketball yeah he see at 64 and this is really good presence of mind you know not could have gotten uh nervous about the three point three or three second call right there but uh kept his composure made a nice pass Tigers now over 5 minutes without scoring trying to put an end to that with the entry to lock in thats middle Brooks Mike and that was uh third foul over the back not a good decision there and hes going to have to come out of the game and that is a big foul this again you you have to have a sense of what your status is uh where you are in the game and what chance you know what is that foul worth it four points and four B boards rather as he goes to the bench Ben Middlebrooks isil Duff is in there defending number 33 on the Baseline with oconnell kind of shut down the Avenue shot clock is at five for shefflin stepping back for three NC State ball lets keep an eye on NC State uh middle Brooks going out about the 1340 Mark you know its not so much its not so much the numbers but how does the offense run you know without him out on the floor Hill couldnt save it right in front of Kevin Keats you know do hadnt played all that much this year and uh you know so his lack of experience what what does that do to the rhythm of the offense Hill is the leading scorer for the season hes got six points although they gave the ball right back to the Tigers who have missed their last six shots approaching a six minute drought in scoring Zachary midrange cannot put an into it you sixminute drought and theyve only gotten a onepoint lead so you havent taken real advantage of that Styles 34 from the floor is a team for NC State coms in is struggle from threepoint distance Mike three of 11 in the ball game shefflin got it from Hunter Jones lining up a three tapped around dof this has turned into a rebounding contest in the last few Applause minutes plus 11 on the boards for NC State in the game a lot of that is on the offensive glass and its done in the first half 10 to one on the offensive glass oh Connell side Rim Zachary got it dof hit the deck hustling to get back in the play Oh for their last eight shot attempts Mike for the Tigers Hunter hell drive and miss shefflin the rebound and he ends the drought again the uh the drive and the uh the penetration by Hunter really got everybodys back turned and sheflin an easy conversion on the glass eight points now for shefflin who had a careerhigh 20 rebounds in their win against Kentucky in the ACC SEC challenge OK conell put it up on the rim not sure if he was trying to connect with doof Hunter knocked Away by oconnell and a foul is called Jamal Spearman right on top of it and so oconnell picks up the foul right now his team trailing by one to the visiting Tigers leag goes to its championship tournament in Winston Salem next weekend so its a busy place here Lenovo Center that was that that was a brilliant move by the NHL to do those outdoor games we should try that with the NBA you want to go Outdoors for the NBA is that right yeah why not why not factor in the wind and the angle of the Sun and all that we all grew up playing Outdoors of course coming up next the basketball action continues number 21 Louisville heads to Atlanta to Face Georgia Tech then tomorrow 300 pm Eastern noon Pacific the women take the court number 15 North Carolina battle Stanford are fantastic weekend of basketball continues only on the CW well you got a team thats struggling in in a in a scoring drought and then you put the hunter on the line for three free throws so the lead is four biggest lead of the game for Clemson seven NC State had a fivepoint lead in the first half and the halftime lead was three for the Tigers shot clock is at seven Parker trying to make his way and beat the clock Here Comes loan with the block Parker tried to get it away not in time shot clock violation rockan made that happen by coming over with the late block Applause following play is under review so they will take a look at it as Parker tried a second effort after the block by locken who leads the Tigers in Block shots he is third in the conference as well block shots theres the initial block but now they you know looks like hes still in his hand when the clock is zero um and you know the thing that locking brings is that rare double of not only blocks but steals as well and uh which is unusual you know usually defensive players one or the other especially if for a big guy and it looked like the shot looked like the light was you know and the clock were red there it is and hes just going into a shooting motion at that point yeah lockin has eight points in the game Mike and hes also a double digit scorer on average for the season hes got eight rebounds in this game and had the block shot the second attempt by the just Parker not in time very businesslike too not very quiet go just goes about you know his job Applause Clemson last year 24 12 they lost in the second round of the ACC tournament all the way to the regional final against Alabama beat the Mexico Baylor and Arizona on the way first to lead eight Mike in 44 years for this program what a drive on the Baseline its Del Jones and after that drought feel Clemsons offense has woken up couple of really good drives and then three giveaway free throws NC State be Duke in the regional Final on its way to the final four Styles hops into the paint and connects well he and mcneel have been their most consistent offensive weapons in this game I mean you know Styles has got 15 and everybody else W even close to double figures lockin G grabbed by locken for the foul in the back court Wiggins is checking in for Coach Brownell sheflin leaves hes got eight points and six boards as he goes to the bench that really is a a pretty flexible lineup that Brad Brownell can go to I mean you think of sheflin a kind of a wider body you know shot blocker and then you come in with Wiggins little more athletic but still pretty tall Parker lot of dribbling and the kick Taylor lines up a three G tries to knock it away from Lock and cant do it State now two of seven in this half and three Hunter for a three Hunter hits for kson it went under on that screen left him wide open second three of the game Mike and 14 points for Chase Hunter he is the leading scorer for the Tigers Styles has 15 to lead the way for NC State I mean you know when Duff when hes when hes screening theyre not even playing him you know its like four five on four defensively out there and thats again just the the absence of Middlebrooks out there a guy that you have to respect on that end of the floor tigers with a 91 ACC record best start in the ACC since 2023 when they went 10 and one and the shot clock is down to seven for Hunter we behind the line long rebound gobbled Up by Taylor hes got seven boards in the game well and thats you know your your win players have to become rebounders in this day and age long shots you get long rebounds those guys have to hang in there Applause Parker first bucket for NC State trailing by five with just over eight minutes to go in our second half nice job creating his own Applause offense Tom wormy Mike jaminy CW Courtside Saturday game One locking is wide open for a three and knocks it down not bad I mean you know hes hes been selective you know 36 hasnt taken a ton of them but uh very respectable threepoint shooter locking Mike with his fourth double double this season and 13th like the size for him just four points a game but uh its been good balanced scoring for this team so far today and all of a sudden Clemson has its largest lead of the game at8 points 5143 after leading at halftime 34 31 middle Brooks back in the game now Four Points four rebounds and three personal fouls yeah hes hes got to be smart now for at least the next three or four minutes or so Styles got rid of the defender and hit the three a really nice coming out of the timeout gives his team a nice lift to come out convert get some points get a little momentum 18 points now for styles that leads all scores he is the only Wolfpack player in double digits middle Brooks comes over to help and smother the shot from Jones out of bounds Tiger basketball loan makes a nice play by H it off milbrooks and Middlebrooks defensively helping out sending it out of bounds with his team trailing well youre in for a treat because a special Encore presentation of the CW hit series is happening again this Monday right here on the CW allamerican season 7 premiere Monday 87 Central only on the CW alongside the AllAmerican from Duke Im Tom wormy along with our outstanding production crew here on CW Courtside Saturday just game one Louisville and Georgia Tech to follow with brenaman and Oliver lock in over the front rim pretty nice finish caught that going away from the ball and uh you know of course NC stay shorthanded today we have mentioned that the Brandon Huntley Hatfield not available for the wolf pack so that really sets them back as well 13 points now for locken as that one goes out of Applause bounds 10 turnovers in the game for NC State they only average about nine and a half per game Mike thats the fewest of any team in the CC 45 shooting on the game as a team for the Tigers trying to go 5 and one on the road in the ACC I expect this uh to be very methodical here in the last 6 minutes mconnell closing on Wiggins shooting over oconnell for two yeah its an easy shot I mean just a big height disparity there johy Wiggins has nine points Styles and they needed that Applause three how about 21 points and five made threes for Styles yeah I mean hes been half of NC States offense and its been a struggle for everybody else tying a season high with that total thats Dylan Hunter twisting and scoring you know middle Brooks has to be careful theres no other shot blocker out as you know its really four guards out there three guards in Styles first points for Dylan Hunter Mike Styles has five made threes thats a new career high for threes made in a single game for Styles so his last two games thats really been a weapon for him hes got nine made threes in his last two games he made four in the road game at Duke on Monday 523 to go in regulation the lead is eight Trey Parker The Freshman on the inbounds NC State trying to stop a five game losing Applause streak you dont see that very often but they call the carry on Applause it see the point being so at least with Middlebrook setting the screen you have to honor that and that makes the play run a a little bit more efficiently but he tried to gain some ground and uh turn the ball Applause over when Clemson had that scoring drought Mike earlier in the half it appears that NC State just didnt capitalize enough in that situation they didnt they didnt capitalize at all I mean he just they got a onepoint lead and that was the sum Applause total so thats the fourth on Middlebrooks now things getting a little dicey for the pack on their home floor where theyre nine and four this season two and three in conference play Wiggins is at the free throw line in just two weeks the CW becomes the exclusive home to the NASCAR infin Xfinity series catch all the pure raw racing that only the NASCAR Xfinity series brings the new season starts with the biggest race of the Year historic

him when Im when theyre in Charlotte Im coming into the booth Im going to be sitting up there with them NC State needs to shift into overdrive right now Mike inside of five minutes to go they need to make up some ground on the track yeah they need a little cold trickle here Styles Parker got it back in score good hustle inside yeah its just Applause uh well this is uh like you said this p team is a good ball handling team too so its going to be tough to turn them over tigers have also won eight of their last nine a wide open three for Jones batted around to Middlebrooks he got that was a massive screen that put on him too last win for NC State January 8th at home against Notre Dame by a point stop Catch and Release weakside Hill goes right back to the rim and scores hold on jinsky sixpoint game nice job fighting on the weak side anticipating where that shot was going to miss timeout Clemson NC state has made five of its last seven field goals and theyve closed the Gap to six on theres that pick and roll and uh normally you know with defense there he would have Tak taking it but uh lockin has had a wonderful game double double for him 13 points 10 rebounds he can knock down that that free throw line jump shot also can roll inside has blocked a couple of shots fourth double double of the season for Victor lockin five of nine from the floor and the 13 points and 10 rebounds that leads everybody in the rebounding category as well tigers with the basketball and the lead we had a 11 lead changes three times tied in this game and a threepoint halftime lead for the Tigers working the perimeter with Dylan Applause Hunter well and you know that last NC State run came with shein out of the game so uh lets keep a keep an eye on him back on the floor for Clemson Steel by Chase Hunter and he goes in for the jam well theres the answer by Clemson coming out of that timeout Applause in the blink of an eye Five Points with a three from one brother and then Chase with the steel after the Dylan three for the jam Parker needs the three doesnt get it what a shift and momentum out of the timeout Mike You seen both teams really respond well coming out of the timeouts but uh boy thats a thats a big response from the Tigers theyve got their large largest lead of the game with two and A2 minutes to go in the shot clock just inside a 10 for Chase Hunter picks it up shoots it in hits Poise and composure seven seven straight points and all from the hunter brothers and a timeout for NC State from Kevin Keat Chase Hunter now Mike with 18 points to lead the way for the Tigers this afternoon a great you know that little lazy crosscourt pass that just leads to the fast Music break he looks like hes been here for a few years I mean his sixth year in the program hes over 400 career assists eighth in school history over 100 career steals what and but I think you talk about a guy who looks like he appreciates Zachary being here I mean theres just so much responsibility has been taken off his shoulder defensively that it is it has freed him up to do a lot more offensively this year and also you know to roam a little bit and uh what a what a great pickup for them yeah Chase had a 30point game at boyy stay a careerhigh earlier this season coming up next number 21 Louisville looking to stay hot theyve won 10 in a row theyre going to Atlanta to hagon Georgia Tech CW Quicks side Saturday number 21 Louisville against Georgia Tech coming up next only on the C W Tom brenman Brian Oliver the Georgia Tech Legend standing by for game two of CW Courtside Saturday so glad that youve been with us so far please stay with us for game two were in Raleigh we got two minutes and change to go Gman yeah cant really say enough about the job Pat kelse has done at Louisville this year taking over the program this season just exactly what that program needed from the College of Charleston where he had incredible success as well and went through it before that to has one everywhere exactly two minutes to go now in regulation there was a bump there lo picked up the foul NC state has that little bit of a run Brad Brownell calls a timeout and its a 13point game just like that Brad Brownell has won 144 ACC games we told you his wins of 282 thats the most in school history at Clemson in his 15th season and they have been trouble as a road team in the ACC theyre trying to go to five and one shot clocks at five Taylor Parker gets it away locken grabs it feeds Hunter Hunter did not go completely across well both both feet and the ball have to go across for it to be for officially in the front court and now using the clock to their advantage for the ti tigers and NC States got a foul a bunch to theyve only got thats only their fourth team foul it seems like just a couple of minutes ago Mike NC State cut this lead to six yep and they know about close games all season thats pretty much all theyve played in ACC Music games theyve lost seven of their last eight three of their last five by three points or less four ACC losses right down to the final possession theyre going to need to do something special right now to make that happen again with just over a minute to go onside kick return it for a touchdown some fourpoint plays would help that Styles oh man time out immediately Kevin Keats yeah if theres if theres a bright spot in this uh Game DVD its Mr Styles hes been terrific Styles was with another three Mike hes now six of eight on threes in 20day at home against Georgia Tech and then next Saturday their home game is against Duke and that could be for the lead in the standings depending on what Louisville does today as well and thatll thatll have huge thatll be a quad one game and thatll have huge implications for their resume Little John Coliseum will be busting at the scenes you think when the Blue Devils come into town into tiger toown Clemson South Carolina I know about that I went in there in my senior year with my team ranked number one and we came out with a loss in overtime still a stinging memory not that it still lingers with me unfortunately for NC State Mike they are running out of time here down by 10 535 to go and the Tigers have the basketball still only still two fouls away from the bonus this could be their fourth win in a row on the road in the ACC for the Tigers as they call timeout and uh still uh one time out left for Clemson month to go before we even get into March and then in March were headed to Spectrum Center in Charlotte North Carolina yes sir that facility will host the tournament for the third time itll be the 14th time in Charlotte both Mike and I call Metro Charlotte home and we cant wait for midmarch in the ACC tournament the 72nd ACC tournament with this NC State program as the defending champ D plays is going to be an opportunity for a team like a you know Louisville doesnt play them anymore this year in the regular season so um but for Clemson its a huge its a huge opportunity right now we have six AC teams in the top 50 in the latest net Duke Louisville Clemson hit North Carolina and SMU which won here on this floor a week ago on the CW must angs coming to town to post a win and it looks like the Tigers might do the very same thing theyre trying to chase Jones down he gets away from them and wake wake beat pit today so good win for them and they you know they just had they really struggled in November but theyve been playing very well of late you know they they lost the tough game at home to Duke but you know Steve Forbes team is playing very very well I mean Clemson Mike was seven and one last month well best record in that month in 90 years well and theyre they so right now their Marquee win is against Kentucky at home in the SEC challenge which was a you know fabulous win for them Duke also beating Auburn their only loss of the Season those were the two wins it was it was quality over quantity in the ACC Challenge and you know for for North Carolina their issue is I mean their their strength of schedule is incredible but theyre theyre one and eight against you know quad one teams Chase Hunter adding to his total tigers are going to improve to 18 and4 10 one in the conference and 5 one on the road in the ACC I dont care what teams youre playing Mike on the road to the ACC yeah thats exceptional so thats thats where you thats where you build thats where you build a great ACC record you went on the road you prove yourself there thats you belong near the top and Chase Hunter turned up the heat when they needed him heve scored 11 of the last 13 points for the Clemson Tigers inside of 30 seconds to go in the game 24 seconds remaining 10point difference and it appears that NC State will put up the White Flag there wont be another player for NC State and double figures in this game styles had 24 and a careerhigh with six made threes that not enough came up short of his career high by two points but in the end all the numbers and the ones that really count favor the Tigers they win it on the road 6858 over NC State G man very impressive win and uh you know NC State being short of big guys certainly help hurt them against this squad uh Clemson has showed their Road tough they continue that streak very deep um an older team um you know shefflin his health is going to be a a factor going down the season but he looked good today you know locking I love what I see from out of him um Hunter is Hunter uh this is a this teams going to be a factor going into March as a team they shot 48 they have now onon four in a row on the road in the ACC there is more to come from Raleigh on PW Courtside Saturday the Tigers win at 68
