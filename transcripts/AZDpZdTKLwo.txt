last Saturday Brian that was a home game against Cal and a loss 6562 for the pack which has lost three in a row SMU in the black NC State in the red black and white and they own the opening tip with oconnell nine and nine on the season that Wing three bounces off good hustle inside styles to keep it alive NC State went just one of 10 last Saturday on threepointers they made their very first one and then did not make another three the entire game Hill SMU has the Applause basketball in fact Jaden Taylor was the only Wolfpack player to make a three in that lost to cow smus pretty good bran 14 and five on the season theyve won 10 of their last 13 games they take the shot clock down to seven Edwards Connell defending Edwards trying to get to the rim shot comes up short middle Brooks grabs it for the pack a good defensive possession by NC State you understand that SMU theyre going to run a lot of ball ball action where theyve got to do a lot of showing youre going to see a lot of switching by the guards on the perimeter critical game this afternoon for both teams especially NC State which has lost five of its last six game games their last win January 8th at home against Notre Dame by a point as Middlebrook shot misses the intended target its going to stay at this end of the floor keep your eye on that match up between middle Brooks and igulu you got two bigs right there middle Brooks theyre going to give him a chance to establish himself early ULU at 72 does a really good job of defending the post by himself Connell on the inbounds quick release Marcus Hill J and for me thats the guy thats got to get started to get him going heill is a 50 shooter hes a guy that you can put give the ball and he can go get you a bucket early and set the tone for this wolf pack team that 50 shooting from Hill is fourth best in the ACC has 13 points in the lost to Cal last Saturday trying to work it inside on the Block lot of physicality in there Middlebrooks held his ground diving to the court to try to save it fighting with two Mustangs ball in the arrow favors SMU theyre still fighting for that loose Music ball lets take a look back at that Mark of a fighter moment brought to you by Melo and middle Brooks averages almost a block and a half a game stays solid challenges him right there at the rim thats one of the things Ben Middlebrooks is going to establish that toughness you Kevin Keats you just came off of a game against Cal that you should have won you want to set the tone one of the things you want is youre big on defense to be able to give it to your Applause Music early and C State basketball with okell against bopy Miller Matt cross picked up the foul in The Fray there so it was not a hell ball and right now the arrow favors NC State on the drive in traffic Styles right to Yu and going to the freee throw line Kevin Keats all the way to the final four last season an ACC tournament championship in his eighth season 148 wins as the head coach of the pack hes 97 and 36 at home Brian hes also 85 and 33 in this building well and and heres the thing since hes been here I mean he his calling card is having a team that plays Relentless defense they want to get out and try to run and again we talk about the fact that coming off of that run last year for the final four a lot of expectations for this NC State team you know some have been a little worried but I think that the way that they play they still put themselves in the mix all the way to the National semifinals a loss against Purdue in Glendale Arizona after beating Texas Tech Oakland in overtime Marquette and Duke in the regional final 7664 that was in Dallas Texas SMU making the trip from Dallas Texas I see what youre doing there yeah theres Andy Enfield we had had a great conversation with Coach Enfield not really that thrilled with the effort against Louisville he he wasnt I mean and they played against you know probably the surprise of the league in Louisville and what theyve been able to do they were down by 30 at one point and this is one of those opportunities that they fell short an opportunity for a quad one win and they did not show up like he wanted Louisville made 19 threes against the Mustangs R Smith had 10 by himself ripped out of there by Applause Music Applause James hesitation rolls in good recognition by Hill he realized that he had a bigger Eagle Tulu on him and anytime you got a guard with a big out there you go right at him get a little separation and got that jumper to go good start from Marcus Hill active defense inside from Huntley Hatfield wheres number one in white get yigu on the inside a lot of clutter in that painted area and stolen Taylor hopping to the rim able to score itay and this is the start for Kevin if youre Kevin Kei this is what you wanted out to a 80 run theyve been able to limit SMU we talked about this as a team that wants to try to get downhill Miller finally gets the Mustangs on the board here in the first half and much needed shot by book booby U booby excuse me Miller to get him rolling averages over 14 points per game that is 19th in the conference best on the Mustangs roster the Junior from Chicago Illinois who played a season at w Forest as well oconnell quick release flying in with Styles he lost the handle underneath had it for a moment Edwards comes away with it Matt cross cross has spent some time in the ACC unable to catch that pass at Miami and also at Louisville for cross that pass is too far for the pack and its back to SMU down by six and NC State coming out turn it up with their defense and you see what theyre able to do get out and transition open it up early with an 8 to2 run and then you foul and you end up losing on the free throws and in the last game against Cal they were up by one under two minutes to go and it just didnt go and they couldnt score at the very end in fact four their last five losses all ACC games for the pack by three points or less in the last three losses by a total of eight points stolen to the rim and the layup will fall hustling out ahead Marcus Hill Jr and what you seen from NC State is that theyve come out and theyve had a level of toughness and aggressiveness with their defense been able to turn over SMU Im characteristic because this SMU team normally does not have any problems getting into their offense right now struggling a little bit to find their all SMU so far is one for four from the floor they missed 13 of their first 15 shots on Tuesday against number 25 Louisville game was played in Dallas and a loss for SMU shot clock all the way down to one cross beats it with a three and nice nice jump shot by cross I thought that play was set up by a quendo penetrate forc to help crosses one of those guys look for him today hes a guy that can go inside out and exploit some mismatches he led the team with 18 points also a game high eight rebounds and 33 minutes of action in The Lost to Applause Louisville defensive help with the Mustangs trayor trying to save it in front of that SMU bench foul was called in the process it looks like Roger SS Gregory Nixon Jeff p in charge of the action Chuck Harris picks up the foul CC State team you know doing a better job of being able to attack the rim for your SMU you know that they do not shoot a lot of threes and make a lot of threes and try to do a better job of locking down that that lane NC State doing a good job of being able to T to hoop NC State just under six made threes per game thats last in the conference quick turnaround that bounces off for Hill he does lead the way so far with his six Applause points cross all by himself passing tight quarters bounces away Hill shovels it into the corner thats for Applause three Dennis Parker couldnt find the mark trying to get back defensively against cross who forces the issue second chance for cross and a whistle contact underneath hey man cross doing a good job of being able to get in transition get downhill again hes the guy we talked about again it can shoot the three but watch him on the penetration realize he can initiate the contact comes back and gets that offensive rebound Powers it back up and draw draws that foul cross the transfer from UMass where he played two seasons in ammer Massachusetts for the Minute Men Louisville and Miami prior to that here at SMU Middlebrooks rejoining the lineup for NC State 70 of the season from the strike Matt cross out of Beverly Massachusetts so cross now has four points hell get a breather Keon Ambrose Hilton iss into the lineup for SMU their first year in the ACC he stayed a charter member of the ACC back in the early 1950s its a high arcing three and a miss from Applause Parker quendo also in there number eight in Black threepointer for the Mustang comes from Harris and great ball ball screen for Harris to get him freed up Harris one of those guys makes about two threes a game if youre in North Carolina State you got to make sure that you find him and make him put the ball on the floor all of a sudden SMU on a 70 run and the traveling violation turns it over in this onepoint game Chuck Harris the senior from Ashburn Virginia little reverse Ball action you see Harris get a chance to set his feet little misdirection with the pick and roll right there but hes one of those guys again give him an opportunity to get start he will throw up threes and theyre going to give him a chance to knock down plenty of him this afternoon Harris is a double digit scorer averages over 12 points per game struggled a little bit against Louisville Bryan was just three of 10 from the floor seven points four boards for Chuck Harris senior in a transfer from Butler where he spent three years in that program powerful drive up the back e U trying to follow basket interference a Follow by yigu good clear out that last time watch Harris go there it looked like it was coming off yigao goes above catches that ball while its still in the cylinder so the Junior from France Johan tror and Yu from Instanbul Turkey 72 freshman middle Brooks midrange and Nice Shot nice face up by middle Brooks he realized that yigo was off of him gave him a little bit of a jab step to see if hes going to bite knocks down that shot 49 from the floor this season for Ben Middlebrooks second year at NC State spent two years in Clemson as well where he played 60 games playing in his 100 and 19th game in college today yatu Shifty little move and a soft touch yeah nice rotating a nice slip by yiga Tulu gathered himself realiz he had a smaller guard let him get by Soft Touch around the bucket Dennis Parker Jr got bumped Paul mcneel also in there number two in white Hill sends it all the way across mcneel that was a three weak side taken in by a quendo Applause some you had one three in a row before the loss to Louisville as Oquendo missfires they keep it alive out the Miller hustle inside from Ambrose Hilton Harris fires away to match the jersey number rocking the three ball hes got six SMU starting to find their offensive consistency a little bit more Rhythm right time see Harris we talked about him hes a guy heow him to get set up already two made Threes And it results in the first lead of the afternoon for SMU which trailed 8 nothing early on in this first half to NC State hell try the corner again with Mick heel hell rattle it home for a three ball corner pocket and great penetration by Hill forces the defense to help and gets the ball out and again for NC State you continue to break that paint its going to give great opportunities for you just the third made three of the season for Paul mcneel Harris just a little bit of daylight mcneel tries to run it down oconnell is also there for NC State Michael oconnell over 900 career points as he flies to the rim and lays it in he he caught Miller sleeping that time Miller thought he was going to come off the pick and roll and was able to get downhill and get to the bucket coach Enfield knows Michael oconnell from his days at Stanford spent three years in that program coach Enfield was the coach at USC before coming to SMU heu couldnt handle it bumbled it away to mcneel whos provided a little spark here its five turnovers so far for SMU its batted away underneath the bucket here come the Mustangs on the Stampede and then Miller got trampled there by Marcus Hill who couldnt put on the brakes his first personal foul ASU Str good early to find their offense but they bring in Chuck Harris the sniper comes in and knocks down not only one three knocks down two and then you see NC State comes back to answer Parker says I got it NC State up by three made three threepointers Chuck Harris has two of themc state two of seven on the threes Trey or the turnaround could not calculate the angle well defended by middle Brooks it was and I thought that for midle Brooks he does a good job of being able to challenge and and you see for NC State I think that theyve done a good job of being being able to to pressure and stifle smus first couple of options on offense three pass has come into the game for NC State number four in white midd Brooks looking for a safety Val mcneel who has not played a lot before today it only played in 11 games and attempted 14 shots missfires on that one for number Applause two bouncing into the corner trayor able to keep it alive over Middlebrooks once again middle M Brook straight up and defending effectively and good challenge by middle Brooks not allow tro to get that extension that he wants and for NC State continue to put pressure on the bucket as you see the penetration and the Finish By Styles transfer from Georgetown who played two years at North Carolina middle Brooks up to contest the shot from Endo in midair mind you weve got contact and watch styles on this last time getting downhill splits both the Defenders gets over and a little Nifty shift it to the left hand as tror come over for the block state with the lead State they opened with that 80 run Brian they they did and and I love the fact that this pace favors NC State because again we talked coming in this game SMU leagues the conference in points scored at 84 right now only 14 points looking for a Cable News Network which respects all Americans then you have a new home with news Nation see why newsnation is Americas most trusted K News Network to find newsnation on your screen go to newsnation nowcom see SMU extend their pressure again they want to try to get this pace up a little bit NC States done a good job of attacking the rim Styles attacking aggressively but if you notice with Styles hes a guy that does not mind mixing it up he searches for contact he goes in and watch this last time you know they get the ball up to him and he hits right to the basket absorbs a contact does a good job of being able to stay focused for the oldfashioned and one Styles has comeing in this first half been Ultra physical for NC State wolf pack treor picked up the foul Styles at the free throw line the old school threepoint play 62 from the line for Styles this season and hes got seven of the 22 so far in the first half for NC State Tom wormy Brian Oliver the Georgia Tech Legend and the MVP of the ACC tournament back in the day rocking in the 9s with Brian Oliver by the way these two teams havent met since the 80s Brian 1988 Im glad you got off the 90s I thought you were going to say Brian Oliver who used to rock the short shorts back in the day well you did but Au quendo right to the rim he had an open Lane and he knows his alleys great move by quendo I love the fact that for SMU that last time you got to your second third option allowed him to be able to get downhill and part and get right down the score pass came up short on the three igu able to pull it in Bron pass best threepoint shooter by percentage for the pack 48 missed the last one yigao trying to work the block again with a soft bounce and and Tom hes got a nice touchdown there I love the fact that he was able to get take his time a little running sky hook by yigu freshman from Stull turkey Styles took it right to him off the back iron which was unkind in that instance o quendo lining up the three and knocking it down and you know what set that play up with the Roll by yotu it forced the defender to have to come over you swing the ball over to a quendo knocks that down and SMU starting to find a little bit of Rhythm on their offense seven points for Endo his first three of the game he now has 25 made threes in his career Huntley Hatfield a little too strong cross the clearance turkey Harris who had started the last four games for SMU not in the starting lineup today is a quendo got swallowed up by styles on the Baseline and good defense by Styles realiz a guy like a quendo you got to crowd him force him to put the ball on the deck that last time staying with him forces that turnover sixth of the game so far the first half for Applause SMU see SMU in what looks to be like a one31 zone for a team in NC State that doesnt shoot and make a lot of Threes you want to force them on the perimeter deflected taken back by pass feeds the corner in Styles and that one also deflected out of bounds cross was closing fast so SM bran is in the midst of a 70 run it truly has been a game of runs here in this first half a onepoint lead for the Mustangs and it has for NC State you want to attack the gaps on this Zone dont want to be limited to shooting threes you see Styles come up short on that one quendo will run it up hes got eyes for the rim gets by his Defender not enough on it cross is there to clean up the mess and man cross is one of those guys again we talk about him going in and out does the Dirty Work that last time coming to get that offensive glass extend this lead to three for them and again SMU doing a good job of crashing offensive class six points for the senior Matt cross a three point Advantage for SMU its a little too strong volley balled around taken by Edwards 90 Run for the Applause Mustangs lost to Louisville snap the threegame winning streak Up and Under creatively from BJ Edwards thats an 110 run SMU and Kevin Keats wants to talk about it with his wolf pack well I think one of the things that NC state has to do is find a way to to limit those paint touches by SMU you talk about that 110 run got to rether Music regroup so this Tuesday on NXT the womens Tag Team titles on the line as Bailey and Julia face off against roxan Perez and cor J you are not going going to want to miss this NXT is all new this Tuesday 87 Central right here on the CW got a heavyweight match up right here between SMU and NC State it will be their only meeting during the regular season we told you that they played in the 1980s Brian 1985 SMU lost here in Raleigh 7882 they played in December of 88 that was a win for SMU against then number 16 NC State by two so theres a little bit of History coach Andy anfield was here with USC to play a couple of NCAA tournament games in this venue and hes a longtime assistant of Leonard Hamilton of Florida State so he was certainly here in that capacity well 1985 then Im wondering is that back in the Derek whittenberg thorough Bailey uh Sydney low era were all for it 1983 national champs turn around Styles wow that was halfway down and curved out better offensive look that time you got inside that zone and so NC States got to do a better job but fin you see great recognition and the pass over to yig Tulu had a smaller Guard the guard couldnt really stop it from getting good pass over to get him the bucket down low SMU has made six of its last seven field goal attempts NC state has missed its last seven tries from the floor Hunley Hatfield able to maintain the pivot foot shot clock is inside of 10 for Styles had time to get a good look at it it leads to a run out Miller oneonone against okono the help came from Styles and it ends up with McNeil three on two tough dribble for mcneel BJ Edwards to the floor to save it foru and thats just the third turnover so far in the first half for n still great block on one end but great Hustle back in transition by SMU not give NC State an opportunity for an easy one cross onlay Hatfield NC State found himself down a little bit of a slump they got to find a better way to break the paint havent had a field goal since a 744 Mark we inside of 3 minutes to go and another Miss from the corner from McNeil who does have a threepointer in the game heres what you do not want to do if youre Kevin kes team you dont want to settle most times when teams go to a Zone theyre trying to challeng you and we talked about this is a team that only makes about five threes a game you got to find a way to continue to get to the point the paint NC State just 30 shooting so far in the first half 46 for SMU shot roock at six U one triple head over the front rim and again ULU doing a good job of rolling a lot of times the defense is Shifting that time Matt cross saw him a smaller Defender he keeps the ball up high no challenge at The Rim 150 run yigo has eight points L the way for the Mustangs in NC state has missed its last nine shot attempts poked away from styles by Edwards goes out of bounds off the Mustangs youve seeing both teams go back and SMU doing a good job get it down to the big fella catching himself and extending that lead up to nine SMU ahead Music Applause he this Applause Tom this has been a game of runs first it was NC stayed being able to get that lead but then as of late you saw SMU get on their own run over the last 5 minutes and 9 seconds 1 15 run and they been able to do a better job of being able to space out NC State break the gaps hit the roller finish at The Rim they have found their offense and then for NC State youre one for 10 from behind the arc you got to continue to find ways to break that paint and get those inside shots you see block shot that could have been a foul by by cobber okay Kevin Keats Im sure he took one look at that box scoreb and said not again one for 10 thats what they did against call atol a week ago but heres what happened is that in SMU went to the zone and they cut down the paint touches by NC State NC States got to find a way to continue to be agressive we take a look at todays game stats brought to you by Morgan Stanley where old school hard work meets bold new thinking 30 so far for the pack that is well below the their season average Brian of 45 which is 10th in the ACC there was a skirmish after the Miss heres another thing NC State started out with their aggressive defense they were limiting smus ability to run their offense since then SMU doing a better job of being able to handle that pressure get to their second and third options if youre stating this last sub two minute Mark you got to continue to get some turnovers Miller accelerating think he was trying to work around around a Harris screen officials are looking at one another and the foul is going against SMU Harris there with a legal block so thats the second foul on Harris you know Brian if youre NC State youre shooting 30 in the first half well below your season average and yet look at the scoreboard youre only down by eight and again you get into those gaps if youre going to shoot those threes thats one thing but you dont want to depend on it continue to move and try instead of going east and west get inside and break that zone Taylor just two points so far for him Connell with two trying to add to the total with the floater it bounces out and the rebound Applause Colbert Edwards the entry to cross Colbert puts it on the deck hes trying to inch his way back towards the rim sh clock is a four Harris against two Defenders hes got nowhere to go let he stayed on the Run they give it to the capable hands of oconnell tough follow away Miss from Taylor final 35 seconds and SMU wants to slow it down with Miller yeah I I love a pick and roll option with Miller and see if you can get a mismatch looks like coach Enfield from SMU has called the timeout his team up by eight stay tuned for todays halftime show presented by Subaru love its what makes Subaru Subaru well go around the ACC we also have the first half analysis and stats from the first 20 minutes of just the third alltime meeting between these two programs with SMU in its first season the ACC along with Cal and Stanford SMU 32 away from Dallas 3 and one in conference play for the Mustangs who won 10 of their last 13 games dont forget coming out Boston College North Carolina which has lost its last two games by a point each time and theyll host BC critical juncture in the schedule for a lot of teams and North Carolinas one of those team and they started out the nonconference took some Ls early but theyve got to get their Rhythm together because theyre going to find themselves in position where they can be outside the bubble last season was the complete opposite for them Brian they won five of their first six ACC games their best start since the late 1980s the script has been flipped this time around and thats a three BJ Edwards and good ball screen forced a little bit of a help with Millan if youre NC State got to pick it up right here try to get a bucket going into the half final 6 seconds Taylor let the defender fly on by and hes got a three and boy they were desperate for that Jaden we crank up the second 20 minutes the destination this season is Charlotte North Carolina for the 14th time in third third time at Spectrum Center the ACC tournament Brian the MVP of the ACC tournament in Charlotte back in 1990 and all the way to the final four with our good friend Bobby kremens and Georgia Tech eatu travel back to NC State yeah and good defense by Middlebrooks and I thought that he was able to hold his ground igulu I thought that when he got to the middle he could have basically taken that jump hook over his left shoulder let see how NC States is able to go right now you see SMU back into a man just 30 shooting as a team of the first half for NC State Connell Styles trying to work on Cross shot clock is down to six for Taylor hit that big three at the end of the first half clock needs to shoot this one from the Baseline middle Brooks on the weak side preserving The Possession Applause Hill against two Defenders Middlebrooks off the threepoint line with the drive big Collision underneath see Edwards on absorbing that contact drawing the charge watch this last play and you see penetration by middle Brooks what looks to be his third foul a lot of times you dont want your big guys having to try to get down heill from the threepoint line little stagnant offense by the wolf pack two points and two rebounds in the first half for Ben Middlebrooks the senior from Fort Lauderdale Florida SMU coming off the loss this week against Louisville NC State lost here on this floor against Cal last Saturday Yu Off the Mark got it back for the easy two fisted Jam we see SMU is trying to understand that middle Brooks has got three fouls theyre giv igulu an opportunity to go oneonone at last time was able to finish at The Rim put back on the dump thats four games in a row now for yulu with double figures in the 12th time this season for samat yulu Hill Middle Brooks had it knocked Away by Miller in the quick hands oh nice dime by Miller ULU running the break SMU doing a good job job of turning that defense and this is what they want they want to get turns and get an early offense Kevin Keats calls a timeout try to rally his troops considering that NC state has not scored yet Brian in the second half and E too is up to 12 points fire last Sunday and then lost to Georgia Tech this week the Louisville Cardinals lost at Virginia Tech last Saturday they retired Elizabeth kitley number 33 in Castle colise thatll be coming up tomorrow Hill into the lane misses the shot just six points for Hill and they came very early in the first half their leading score trying to get on track for NC State his cross misses follows his Miss old school you never see that anymore r okono at the other end thats a three and it looked good as soon as it left his hand andac conell was able to walk right into that SMU got back but then no one picked up aell andc State needs to find some way to generate some offense and get going ke talked about TR of finding a consistent score get the ball to go to you see otulu trying to go for what was a twopointed worst shot in basketball is right there on the foot but Im going to give the big fella a DI the fact that he can uh stretch out and shoot that one he had only attempted one three all season and missed it he was about a half inch away from attempting his second three and making it right on the line its a two jig to okell for back to back buckets he made the Third third threepointer of the game for NC State couldnt connect on that jumper and cross saves it as hes falling out of bounds so B Miller Bryant has just two points so far in the game doing other things though for Coach enford well but heres the thing is you see him shoot that three I thought you were called it up finding other ways to impact the game and again for NC State theyve got to find somebody to get rolling Taylor strong on the three oconnell comes flying in gives it to Hill has some room it bounces out unlucky on the bounce on the drive by Marcus Hill Cross against Styles whos digging in defensively and it does not stop yigu and I think that for NC say you got to send somebody you cant allow yigu to go ahead and put the ball on the floor four times against the smaller Styles but I love the fact that for SMU they realize they got a mismatch and they keep feeding the big guy you too now has 16 points that ties his season high he is our leading scorer today middle Brook sizes up a three Hill inside couldnt get it up on the Square bounces around right to oconnell he got it back for the three it was online Applause Miller feeding the post you can to against Middlebrooks trying to stop him and he does good block by middle Brooks opportunity and transition for NC State to get an easy one Jaden Taylor Styles tries another three and he connects and good penetration by Taylor and again NC State still finding a way to claw back in using their defense to give them some opportunities good knocked down by styles styles the first Wolfpack player to get the double digits hes got 10 his first three of the game four of 17 on threepoint tries for NC State Middlebrooks trying to save it right to yulu who traveled prior to the Lin and that play started by mdle Brooks with his hustle trying to give him opportunity to climb back in this NC State trying to find some way to get into it best way to do is to get a little penetration knock down three to be able to get you back into it for setet yigu whos getting a breather for SMU has all eight points so far for the Mustangs in the second half Middlebrooks all kinds of room tries to get it to pass they cannot collaborate out of bounds and back to SMU yeah middle Brooks that last time I would have loved to see him be able to go in and try to get to the basket NC state has not had many opportunities Trey are basically sat under the basket and led to another turnover still just the fifth turnover of the game for NC State they only turn it over N9 and 1 half times on average this season in per game and thats the fewest in the ACC question now where yigu on the on the bench wheres SMU go to generate this offense 16 points for yigo shot clock is down to five for Miller Miller about 5T behind the Line pass comes up with the rebound good defensive stop right there by NC State missed shot from Taylor into the corner its going to stay with NC State the reset 20 on the shot Applause clock halftime lead for SMU was 8 3426 first year for Andy Music anfield Kevin Keats is in his eighth year at NC State they went 26 and 15 last year 9 and 11 in conference play all the away for the ACC tournament championship in the final four pass Catch and Release bounces out Miller downshifting pass got back in the play to take it away and great Hustle by pass again a lot of opportunity especially in the break for NC State they just got to finish and get a couple to go Taylor trying to turn it into points theyll turn it into free throw Applause attempts third foul on Harris on the Move by Taylor on the inside so Jaden Taylor the senior from Indianapolis Indiana second year at NC State two years at Butler playing in his 125th Career College game 18 points a game high in the lost to Cal a week ago on this floor tell you what he doesnt miss free throws Brian 76 on the season 50 of 66 coming into the game and the leading scorer for NC State this year and NC state has been able to get back in this game because of their defense you see them extend their pressure a little bit they just got to be able to get a couple of buckets to go right now cutting this lead under 10 need a solid defensive possession right now hes the guy who gets to the line and hes got seven for Taylor and NC State cross pivots and hits and cross did a good job realizing he had a smaller pass on him just took his time gathered and literally shot over him like he was a chair eight for cross now senior from Beverly Massachusetts pass got past the first Defender and then missed the jumper inside the arc 10point Game 12 and 1 half minutes to go in our second half on CW Courtside Saturday so glad that youre with us as muu and the black this is cross in position basket and foul and hes into double digits with 10 and a free throw up coming we take a look back at the mark of a fighter moment brought to you by Melo and tro did a good job in seeing cross on the penetration cuts down there finds Huntley Hatfield late again we talk about Matt cross and the fact that he does such a good job of being able to mix it up inside outside takes advantage of the opportunities had a big and just Dove was able to finish it the rim so pass and Taylor come out of the lineup for NC Applause State cross completes the threepoint play this is the time where NC State needs Marcus Hill to step up for him I thought he started out the game really aggressive hunting his offense and then went quiet towards the end of the half NC State just 14 of the team in the first eight minutes of the second half and the balls going back to SMU trying to work out of that corner and turning it over for the sixth time Hatfield found himself right there in the middle we like to see him turn and look at the rim first obviously you you kick the ball out but youre not getting a lot of opportunities to go right at The Rim BJ Edwards on the handle for SMU cross through a double Music gner oh flying in oh quendo quendo Corner hard at the wreck nine points for Cario Endo the senior from Titusville Florida two of the thunderous variety Huntley Hatfield turns at the free throw line and knocks it down for NC State they needed that one and I think thats one of the ways that you can get back into this game fimu is going to stay in that zone you want to try to get right there in the middle because again that last time Hunley Hatfield found himself wide open first two points of the game for Huntley Hatfield the leading rebounder this season for NC State trying to defend at the other end against cross they tie him up and the arrow favors the pack how about number eight in Black clear for takeoff quando goes to the rim with so honored to be alongside Brian Oliver and our outstanding in production crew for CW Courtside Saturday here in Raleigh North Carolina you see SMU back in that zone again conell with opportunity to set his feet Connell who has made a three in this half for NC State unsuccessful on that attempt that is now four of 18 long distance Dialing for NC State and NC States got to find a way to capitalize down by 13 they forced 11 turnovers only six points off of that you see Matt cross come up with a quendo with opportunity to go back at The Rim again there he goes again attacking the rim just a moment ago he was flying in from the right wing for a jam for number eight I think Huntley hat Phi said that you know were going to go have that again if youre going to earn it at the free throw line no more Kodak moments not in our house the Lenovo Center opened up back in 1999 this home of Vy State basketball lot of physical play underneath oh and a big big collision mcneel and Oquendo McNeil going for the basketball watched this Lex play on the pass Tim McNeil going for the steel H Mendo Collide Paul mcneel seeing significant action today for NC State does have three points one of four from the floor Edwards Huntley Hatfield one arm rebound boxing out with the other and again NC States getting opportunities cuz theyre getting stops they just got to come here you see the foul last thing you want to throw fouls McNeil on a three ill advis contest there so gner picks up the foul mcneel for the three you see right there on the close that the last thing you want to do is foul shootter especially for a team like NC State whos not had any success shooting a three ball today they havent had success from the free throw line this season either Brian 70 as a team is 16th in the now 18 team ACC which by the way when we go to Charlotte three teams will miss out so 15 teams to the tournament in Charlotte which will also be the site next year if youre NC State you do not want to continue to get stops and leave crumbs on the table as you see Miller Ambrose Hilton and also yulu come back into the game its a team thats had 10 offensive rebounds and only capitalizing with two points off of it trying to fight for the Miss off the McNeil free throw f is against Applause SMU Ambrose Hilton picks up his first so NC State keep the basketball you see off the free throw you see the fight that Ambrose Hilton and yigo called on that foul McNeil tough shot he got fouled again and McNeil did a good job of realizing he had a quendo on his side leaned into that that contact opportunity at last time only coming up with one of three need to knock these two down to cut this lead down mcneel had only attempted did four free throws All Season before today it was three of four now hes back at the line one more to come for mcneel his fifth free throw of the game freshman from Rockingham North Carolina six points for Applause mcneel went to dry off the hands and got right back in the play and the double deep taken away see State trying to get it back mcneel again to the free throw line and how about mcneel with the shot of arm with the energy you hear the wolf pack Nation letting them hear it showing their appreciation andc stay with opportunity to get back in this game have turned up their defense watch here good trap right here its Parker with the steal right here Parker comes up couldnt get the first one in how about watching make Neil comes in there fighting for the effort NC State playing some inspired ball over the last few minutes and its been their defense this is a team that Prides itself on the defense and right now extending that pressure SMU need to get the ball in the hand of woy Miller now thats a 70 run by NC State and the clock hasnt been moving all that much either more fullcourt pressure Edwards and Miller trying to break break it oconnell overzealous defending against Miller trying to keep up with boopy that could be a show keeping up with boopy you like that thats what they do in Dallas now watching number two run the Music show OK Connell picking up his first personal foul you talked about the NC State run a little shift in momentum if if your NC State you push up continue to try to deny and you force them to be able to to move that ball hopefully active hands get a turnover and get into some transition so the lead is down to eight which is exactly what it was at halftime Edwards thought about three close out mcneel Miller twisting shot poopy Miller count it and to the line poopy Miller flexes on him a little bit didnt settle for the three watch the replay again they comes out Chas him off for that comes in leans in the contact finishes off with the off hand and in flexes and said yeah Im strong like that 6 feet 175 and a junior from Chicago Illinois transferred from Wake Forest started his career at Central Michigan 82 free throw shooter hes up to four points now in the game remember hes their leading score over 14 per game well I like the fact that even though he has not been able to score with his normal numbers you know watch this right absorbs that contact has presence of mind to be able to finish up I think theyre trying to figure out who the foul was on that last play theyre going to give it to Parker and be his Applause second so Miller to the line to complete the threepoint play if it comes down to the final seconds of this game SMU will look at boy Miller he has two buzzer beating gamewinning shots this season one against Cal Baptist and a threepointer against Virginia to beat the horn this year for Music SMU Taylor Hill mcneel has eight points a season high back to Taylor a couple of feet behind the line side rim Edwards o quendo knocked away as Taylor got back Huntley Hatfield baseball pass up ahead and the Layin drops Marcus Hill Jr beat everyone down the court great pass by Huntley Hatfield was able to get hill behind the defense and again North Carolina State using defensive stops to get into transition got to be able to string together a couple consecutive stops Hill is up to eight points for the senior from Rockford Illinois and the leading scorer this year for NC sting monstrous block Parker coming out of nowhere to reject Music it Hill trying to Chisel his way into that SMUD and a kick on the Mustangs Ambrose Hilton was defending shot clock back to 20 watch The Hustle back in the Ste by Taylor and Huntley had gets it does his best quarterback impersonation gets to Hill to finish and again weve seen this is how NC States going to get back into this game and Tom another thing is that as SMU sits back in that zone if Im NC State I try to get the ball inside the middle right there around the free throw line hill hill got it good shot by Hill but again you get the ball into Huntley Hatfield and it looks like there was yet another turnover by SMU NC State doing a good job of finding some offense and turnning around forcing Andy henfield to call a turn time out Marcus Hill is into double digits in scoring has done a better job of being able to use that defense to turnover SMU and then capitalize on the other end that last player youre able to get behind the defense of your Marcus Hill to ignite this little run right now 14 turnovers have turned into 10 NC State points an 113 run for NC State which Trail by as many as 15 just a few minutes ago and I think that you continue to to ride that intensity get some turnovers and you got to be able to capitalize on these opportunities two players into double digits Styles and Hill Taylor couldnt get to it ball fumbled into the corner cross tries to take a swipe at it ends up in the NC State bench am Miss uh SMU is basically theyve kind of fallen off a little bit they got to get their Rhythm back I thought that earlier on they had huge command of this game seem like theyve Gott a little flustered by the pressure for NC State sevenpoint game for NC State Brian shooting 23 in the second half now theyve scored some points at the free throw line and theyve got to get something to go they getting better looks now I thought the quality looks at the end of the first quart first half were a little rough but right now doing a better job of getting these quality looks just got to get some shots to go seven of nine from the free throw line in the second half for NC State Hill able to keep it alive shot clock winding down they get the jumper from Taylor to beat the clock nice penetration by Taylor to get right there in the paint right now gotten this lead down to five huge momentum shift from SMU I tried to get the ball down to yigao let him go to work 13 13 to3 run by the wolf pack igos the leading score was 16 Cross has 11 hes got the basketball carving his way inside igulu got the offensive board he missed it and Huntley Hatfield knocked it out of bounds with 710 on the game clock I thought eulu got got away with a little bit of a push there on Huntley hfield Huntley Hatfield doing a good job again furic State continue to stay physical SMU the highest scoring team in the league br over 84 points per game theyre at 52 right now with 7 minutes to go o quendo cross Catch and Release bounces out tapped around to the pack McNeil still in there with his season High eight points Music shot clock is at eight for mcneel two Defenders on him hill Rises up and hits it big bucket by Hill that last time didnt seem like the NC State had anything and Hill came over talking about it goty hun in his offense ran to the ball back on a nice run here you see cut it down to three Harris Huntley half field in Taylor Converge on Harris Oquendo cutting and scoring and nice cut by a quendo to silence the crowd I thought that Harris did a good job of gathering himself good back cut by quendo Kio quendo 4 SMU now with 11 points hes the third player to get the double digits for the Mustangs Hill takes it pounds it into the floor and hits the jumper and you can tell Marcus H is finish it right now no hesitation right now and again you can tell hes got that that dog in him he and Harrison having words level physicality is amped up 14 points in the game for Marcus Hill Jr it is a threepoint game one of the best Shooters in all of the ACC coming to play in the second half of the pack of the comeback back shot clock inside of 10 Harris Nifty spin cant finish it off Huntley Hatfield Rises for the rebound chance to tie with a three for NC State source of offense has been Marcus Hill again Hill has been that guy a little bit of a clear out action get him on a backside screen four of 20 on threepoint tries for NC State today shot clock to five hill dancing and dribbling takes the shot wide of the Applause mark four and a half minutes to go in regulation o quendo driving to earn free throws Parker was in the vicinity theyll give the foul to Taylor so free throws coming up for Endo the three point shot for SMU Brian is dried up in the second half five of nine in the first half they are 0 of six from long distance in the second half and a lot of that time as because NC state has done a better job of being able to get out and chase them high hands active make sure that theyre challenging those shots and you see reserves coming in for NC State but how about the play of McNeil Huntley Hatfield allow NC State to get back into this game season High eight points for mcneel Huntley hfield has five rebounds to lead the way for NC State so quendo trots to the bench with 13 points in the game five point game 428 to go in regulation teams havent met since the late 1980s they played twice in that decade each team won once NC State will have to travel to Duke on Monday for its next game business to take care of here Middlebrooks gives it up Taylor trying to create some space got it back shot clock is winding down lot of dribbling from Taylor and then the foul from Harris thats his fourth he was defending Applause Taylor I think there a great opportunity to try to give a touch to Middle Brooks down low you need your big guy to be able to get a couple of touches try to get something around the rim both teams will be in the bonus with the next foul were about to cross the 4minute threshold NC State and SMU BC and North Carolina to follow us on CW Courtside Saturday Bryce herd is into the game as well deep in the shot clock Taylor got the defender in the air and he will stride to the free throw line so free throws up coming for NC State when we come back with 347 to go in regulation Music Applause and he has allowed them to be able to get back into and a little bit of a momentum shift we talked earlier about it being a gang of game of runs you see right now andc stayed on a little bit of a run for themselves creating Point production from the free throw line as well they are now eight of 10 in the second half from the line and two for tailor you and I talked earlier about NC State and not knocking down the threes but I think in this second half they made a more concerted effort to put the ball on the floor and then theyve extended their pressure seem like theyre a little bit more aggressive especially with the guards on the perimeter 13 of 16 in the game from the line for NC State SMU has made just two field goals in the last 8 minutes and changeed theyve got the ball yigu backing on down against middle Brooks middle Brooks Smothers him and then a foul committed in the back court Crossing yigu trying to take it back from Middlebrooks committed the foul and great defensive play by middle Brooks you seen it a lot of times in it earlier igula was able to take his time and get there middle Brooks did a good job of being able to lock it up you see craws come up with the swipe gives middle Brooks an opportunity to go for a one and one hasnt been to the line today Ben Middlebrooks the senior 71 of the Season big fell with the friendly roll there how about that clockwise to the bottom of the net tantalizingly slowly on that Rim hes got them both NC state has been able to grind it out see right now theyve got this crowd behind them turned their amp up a little bit on defense onepoint lead for SMU after the free throws from Ben Middlebrooks cross quendo nowhere to go against oconnell Miller Baseline into the corner Edwards thats a three rip of the ropes for the Mustangs and great read by Miller able to get down that Baseline forced to help was able found Edwards wide open that three was able to quiet this this run that NC stadium has been on six of 16 as a team for SMU on threepointers Edwards out of the corner in front of his own bench the lead is four Taylor creating space Applause just a moment ago NC state had the lead down to one havent LED since they LED 2220 with 645 left of the first Applause half shot clock at five Endo shovels to yatu still hanging on that Rim fouled on the way up Bryce herd in the neighborhood theyre going to assess it to Middle Brooks thats his fourth Brian yeah good penetration by quendo force middle Brooks to come over and crowd upset because of yugao was hanging on the rim but its been the

against Virginia Styles Rises up and hits and nice stop by Styles being able to get to that midrange jumper 12 points now for Styles a timeout taken by NC State lets take a look at todays game stats theyre brought to you by Morgan Stanley where old school hard work bold new thinking stands out obviously for SMU the 32 points in the paint and then for for North Carolina state only shooting 31 still finds yourself only down by four despite of being 4 for 20 opportunity here to be able to get back in this game with your defense they need a stop here understanding SMU has the ball with just a little under two minutes yo is the leading score in the game with 18 a quendo has 13 cross has 11 cross has a double double fifth of the Season 15th of his career as he plays this afternoon inside Lenovo Center NC State 9 and three on its home floor two and two in conference play including a win against Notre Dame in early January by a point 6665 we could be in for a fantastic finish once again the ACC with 143 to go two possession game if youre Inc State youve had smus had some problems you extending your pressure and then once you get the ball across half court get into your point guards hand the clock is your friend use a lot of this clock try to get some type of penetration maybe give yulu another Another Touch five assists in the game for bopy Miller closing in on 400 career assists trying to score this time coming up short Taylor pulls in the rebound here in C State you stay within your game dont necessarily need a three you want to penetrate that ball and try to go get the ball inside Hill could be the man to do it gives it to Taylor hes got a three on line short styles coming over the top and then Edwards came out of the freay with it for SMU Styles went Above the Rim barely get his hand you see right now less than a minute is four Miller on the Applause handle Middlebrooks way out to contest quendo Slams on the brakes in the shot clocks a five now tries to make his move but he lost it out of bounds 15th turnover of the game SMU that last possession there andy edfield you have to be upset un first turnover you see 37 seconds left to go the NC stat you need to go quick best threepoint shooter this season Jaden Taylor Taylor has one made three in the game hes got 29 of the season to lead the team oconnell he has a three in the second half Styles kick into the corner back to styles for three yigu up top of the rebound then he was swarmed by Hy Music State good rebound by iGo going up styles would come up short with that three that would have been a big bucket for NC State right now you look at 18 18 seconds left to Applause go NC State is on a threegame losing streak and trying to avoid that fate again with 184 to go SMU looking for its 11th win in its last 14 games including a seven game winning streak late November to late December he get all on the free throw line two for two in the game from the strike clutch free throw 19 points season high for the Freshman nice Soft Touch by yigao at the free throw line hes had a big afternoon I think that hes played solid throughout the entire in both halves and SMU needed a bucket had the first eight points of the second half for SMU right out of the locker room and now a second free throw four for four from the line you toer 20 points in The Game season High Connell has to rush it up and calls an immediate timeout because now its a twopossession Applause game so lets take a look at todays player of the game it is brought to you by Progressive Insurance say when you bundle Auto home and motorcycle insurance visit progressivecom and the guy in the middle of your screen C yatu is going to be our Progressive Insurance player of the game Brian in the game just made a couple of clutch free throws 20 points seven rebounds eight of 13 from the floor well I thought that for SMU they established himself themselves early when they were able to give the big man a touch and we talked about his skill set somebody can throw the ball down to finishes around the rim with that height does a good job of keeping the ball up high and in second half came out in the second half had eight quick points does a good job of being able to run the rim run toward towards the rim and finish and all afternoon been efficient love the game that he has had NBA Scouts have to love his upside and his potential freshman in that SMU lineup no doubt that coach Enfield directing his team to guard the three with a the sixpoint difference here for NC State and Kevin Keats they are four of 22 today on threepointers just five of 32 for NC State in their last two games on threes you can toal Leading The Way with 20 points he leads all scorers I think in the situation now where you need a three I mean who am I looking for Im looking for mcneel who shot the ball will maybe jayen Jaden Taylor and maybe a little misdirection sometimes you know you got Taylor taking the ball out maybe get it ball right back to him but you got to go quick four different players have made one three in the game Hills got it 10 seconds Taylor needs to shoot it he will from three graay the rim out of bounds its Mustangs basketball there only four and a half seconds left and its a sixpoint lead NY stay it closed at to one 5655 after trailing by 15 earlier in this half and what you want to do is obviously at 4
