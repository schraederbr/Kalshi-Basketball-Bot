and well take a look at the the series history talk about how far it goes back Colgate has a tough time getting opponents to play them thats how good they are in the nonconference schedule the 174th meeting Syracuse had won 54 in a row prior to last year Colgate came to the Dome and won 100 to 85 on November 20th of last season well they hadnt won since 1962 and the orange will start the scoring how about that I was three when that happened I was still just somebodys distant thought at that point Mike back in 1962 very difficult yeah I was a headache I was a young headache at that point orange a headache on defense there poking that one away heres mince with the basketball right now one thing in Syracuse they played a lot of man in that first game against Lehigh so lets see how they switch things up Richardson pulls down the miss Colgate the traveling maroon spinning is Woodward cut off by the defending of Edwards plenty of time on the shot clock Applause that just grazed the front rim from Richardson couldnt find the range out of bounds and that is orange basketball well theres the Hall of Famer his 47th year as the head coach and officially Mike if Syracuse wins tonight that is win 1000 he has been to that threshold though in the past he said 1100 in my mind at this point a lot of peoples minds and hopefully sanity will reign here at some point in time and that number will be rectified but anyway you look at it just you know phenomenal phenomenal numbers just as has given his whole life to this community and this school second most all time in wins in division one behind Coach K with 1202 and the most seasons at a current School 47th and certainly the most wins by any coach at his alma mater at a power five I dont know that you will see that again ever Smith Hall of Famer back in 2005 and in 2003 national champions well some couple of year run for him right in there with the national championship and then going to Springfield Mintz will bring it up you mentioned bayheim as a student and player walkon player Applause in the Syracuse program then an assistant coach and the head coach for almost a half century across the way Matt lingle is building quite a program at Colgate and Coach Boeheim has to admire what langel has done in his 12th season Mike lingle is the alltime leader in wins in Colgate history with 178 and they have been to the championship game in their league five straight years yeah theyve really ruled the Patriot uh Patriot League going to the NCAA tournament four times and uh just has really built a culture of winning there and its you know the reason why Tucker Richardson came back I mean Im sure he was a he could have been a hot commodity in the portal if he wanted but uh such as how he feels about this program and this coach and the team Colgate Beat Navy in The Patriot League Championship Game a season ago those games are on the highest seed campus site and so Colgate said that home court advantage as Gerard shot his Challenge and missed Raiders try to run it Syracuse gets back defensively you talked about that win last year they put a hundred points up against the orange in that game Edwards at The Rim denies the shot thats what he does he cleans up a lot of mistakes inside four blocks against Lehigh in his first game Gerard for three and thats what he does best and I really think hes going to have a very very good offensive year off the basketball career three number 214 for Joe Gerard senior out of Glenns Falls New York mince grabs that one last year in that game against Colgate for the orange Gerard had 27 points that was a season High his career high is 30 that came back in 2020 three players to the deck for this one hell ball situation of the arrow favors Colgate this is what happens to you not only the block but you keep control of it too and that just Springs to break you see everybody compressed defensively and uh crossover creation off the dribble for Gerard that time got some space got a good look Syracuse has only played one game Mike that was Monday in a win at home against Lehigh 9072 built a substantial halftime lead and shot 54 percent as a team in that game fifty percent from Beyond The Arc as well to get win number one of Coach boeheims 47th season as the head coach soft bounce and it drops Tucker Richardson by far their main threepoint weapon Tom seven of 17 coming into this game the most attempts by anybody mints in traffic hanging too strong back iron if youre like mints has got the size to get in there and create and he has the gr he has the green light to do that hasnt shown the threepoint shot yet but he can get to the rim Raiders are 21 on the season they launched another three and it goes Lynch Daniels scraping the top of the Dome and knocking it down hadnt played in the first few games that uh Chapel Hill North Carolina colgated missed its first four threepoint opportunities Gerard hit the court awkwardly hes wincing in pain at the other end its Lynch Daniels again and the long rebound to number 11 for the orange Applause Syracuse able to get 42 points in the paint and that win against Lehigh Up and Under Edwards was fouled on the play records was the closest Raider so well take a timeout early action first half Colgate and Syracuse Applause Warrior one it is time for tonights forward keys to the game with Mike jaminsky oh we talked about it before the game Tom and run it back for Colgate to get that win last year can they go back to back uh putting up 100 points again and for Syracuse didnt end it under Jim behind mostly zoned thats what you had to face now playing some mantoman playing some zones switching up he says his zone is still his his best defense and for most of us 1425 career games coached thats what he has relied on Edwards is at the free throw line thats for Edwards got to the line a lot in that first game out eight of ten for him but colgates got some guys up front they have some size and some bodies they can throw at him Edwards had 18 points on five of eight shooting against Lehigh also a member of the Patriot League Applause Edwards also had four blocks in that game Applause trying to work on the Block over the front rim and good from Muffet Brian Moffett a little size he well hes also a threepoint threat as well not a high volume shooter Edwards trying to back it on down but theyre digging in a little bit with Richardson kind of a half double now Mintz got in a congested area and now Colgate trying to run off the turnover moffatt teeing up a three ball rattled it out Brown tried to come over the top with it mince has it colgates three of ten but for the most part you have to like the looks that theyre getting at the basket and remember last year shots were not falling for them early but that changed dramatically as the game wore on I remember last year they shot 40 percent from Beyond The Arc second in the nation and theyre going to get an easy to look like an easy two second effort third effort it finally goes down for records I think Lynch Daniels was worried about defense coming in on him and Records was able to clean it up Colgate did not give up on that play and Syracuse did not get bodies back to get the rebound Mintz couldnt get the shot away hell try Edwards in the paint comes up short Applause now last year Colgate averaged about 10 made threes per game and they shot 53 percent as a team from the floor Applause not surprisingly the number one seed at their Patriot league tournament which they won that was Moffat able to get the defender in the air contact and foul thats going to be Edwards and his first thats the thing if they can get him in foul trouble get that early second thatll be a big big key for them you know we were talking about that the you know with that with the Patriot League the way their postseason is structured the regular season means something because if youre if you win the regular conference you get to host the tournament all the way through get that home court advantage and certainly has served them well over the last five years cymer Torrance has come into the game for the orange Gerard to the bench also coming out Braden Smith number two for Colgate which has hosted that championship game in The Patriot League Mike four years in a row and theyve won the title two years in a row they lost in the first round of the NCAA tournament last year to Wisconsin 6760 and the game was played in Milwaukee Wisconsin Syracuse did not find the postseason last year Mike for the 1617 record Edwards able to gather and score Applause nice interior feed and weve talked about the big bodies Colgate has neither one of them were shot blockers per se I mean theyve got to keep a keep you away from the basket but if Edwards can catch him there he can finish Lynch Daniels top of the backboard and in three dont look now Mike 168 1227 and rolling in the first half and Colgate looks very very comfortable offensively and Applause heres the look on the prior possession nice little lob and catch and the nice thing there is that he gathered himself and then went up strong but just a little drive and Pitch this again the team you have to close out on you dont usually get that roll here but uh the threepoint shot three of nine now in the game for the Raiders you know this is the thing to be said too this is colgates fourth game maybe a little bit more of a rhythm a little farther along in game action than Syracuse Thompson comes into the lineup for Colgate Tonight is their fourth game in nine days to get the season started as Mintz is short of the free throw its a long season in college basketball for these guys I mean you start we started doing games on the seventh a beautiful back door you know you have to respect Richardson out in the perimeter and he just took what the defense gave him Jim Boeheim with a quick timeout how about the collaboration by the Raiders sliver of daylight Woodward finds Richardson 164 Run Music and by The Fresh Market voted number one best supermarket in America I think you can see my old dormitory from that view mic right there the skyline of the Syracuse University campus and inside the Dome a 164 run by Colgate gonna rile up the fans and beautiful play right here by the Raiders Mike yeah we talked about Tucker Richardson you have to guard him number 15 up at the top and Judah mints number three as he goes out in the wing you see him hes looking at the ball rather than his man nice backcourt back door cut and Jeff Woodward more wired as a as a passer in that offense then as a score it was a beautiful look he gave him right there some old school basketball from the Raiders Gerard lining it up thats another three nice to see that coming out of a timeout to get executed get him a look and maybe get this crowd into the ball game he was a little flat right now for Syracuse second three in the game for Gerard its Baker from the corner weak side Torrance that play that we showed was a mantoman Syracuse coming out in the zone these last couple possessions Torrance looking for an Alleyway to the bucket he couldnt go up and under Roy Torin with mints and uh and Torrance they got two guys who can attack the rim Lawrence got it back elevates off the glass the tip over the top Danny Williams sophomore from Bowie Maryland out leaves everybody and Taps it in for the orange hes a terrific athlete they want him to use that athleticism and uh hes a guy that really needs to step up this year we need that Wing player needs scoring in defense from him he got the start from the game against Lehigh Benny Williams only two points and three boards in 23 minutes of action averaged about two points and a rebound and a half a season ago theyre going to need bigger numbers from number 13 to contend to the ACC this year Torrance fires away Williams power dribble off the glass and it spins on down you know for a guy like that and we talked about it he needs things like that to happen to give himself some confidence you know that bounce right to him he gets the Finish two consecutive baskets on offensive rebounds now he feels a little bit better about himself prior to that three Syracuse was on a 70 run Lynch Daniels trying to silence the crowd a little maybe earlier we admire the confidence certainly he might want to slow your roll a little bit GMan with a contemporary expression I love it Gerard trying to speed up the role for the orange Torrance a little fancy dribble that was headed out of bounds and save Lynch Daniels into the front row nine and a half minutes to go in our first half Tom wormy Mike jiminsky and our outstanding ACC college basketball production crew with you from Syracuse New York none other three for the gate Chandler Baker and Woodward the guy making things happen offensively out there the pass out of the center position for that open look Baker picked up the foul on the Baseline colgates now made five threepointers in the game Mike heres the look inside we talked about the athleticism in the crowd you should stick your hand up so that the official scorer gets your number right and then bounce right to him good finish on both those baskets inbounds from Torrance you got the double digits against Lehigh 10 points for Torrance to match the jersey number and a career high a lot of dribbling Fall Away halfway down and out for Torrance I was trying to take advantage of Lynch Daniels a smaller cover on him but uh no ball movement just a lot of dribbling one on one five of 13 on threes for Colgate in the first half Syracuse just two of seven and Gerard has made both of those and Williams the contact and the foul for the orange first on Williams career game number 100 1000 rather 426 for Coach Boeheim chatting with Torrance on that sideline trustee assistance Jerry McNamara Adrian Autry Allen Griffin going the other way and Colgate picks up a foul like Lynch Daniels and his second I mean Woodward has the ball there and he got the turnover that time you dont want to hes not going to shoot from there and its at least been reluctant to shoot up to this point but hes been a very good distributor so you just want to bother him be have active hands and disrupt passing Lanes Gerard Mintz Copeland on the floor for the orange has come in as well number 55 Gerard from the Baseline tapped out to mince guarded by Smith and bumped that humans just out there setting screens but did a nice job tapping that ball back to recycle The Possession Benny Williams also remains in the game fifth team foul against Matt langels team how about that how about the extension through 2030 for coach langel and well deserved yeah nice job security there such as it is in this profession Copeland too strong over the top and a rim Bender Monir hema and thats where hes going to get his point uh and so and Syracuse has gotten back in this game on the offensive glass uh you know Benny Williams a couple of Second Chance baskets and now hema aim of the transfer from Duquesne played his high school ball at St Benedicts High School in New Jersey out of the corner colgates got another three the baker and that was under duress too uh he had Huma Baron down on him good concentration on that so thats six made threes in the first half for Colgate mens High degree of difficulty Baker came down with it Applause Richardson thought about that Richardsons been quiet in this game so far foreign ERS keep it alive Richardson yeah but thats you know how many times we see that offensive rebound defense scattered you find your best shooter so Richardson with that last three 702 to go in our first half we really gotta go Colgate up 30 to 18 702 and they built this from the threepoint line last year we talked about that win 18 of 43 from behind the arc and Tom so far in this game seven of 16 16 of the 22 field goal attempts have been threes and its been spread around theyve got three guys of Knocked Down triple so far for the Raiders Richardson leads the way with 10 points he just made that last three hes got a couple of threepointers to his credit its a 122 run over the last three minutes for Colgate we told you about Tucker Richardson top of the broadcast and pretty much top of the scouting chart as well I would think Mike on each and every night especially in Patriot league play but certainly tonight and its its been its been a quiet 10 points you know up to the only five field goal attempts for him very efficient he hasnt really hunted his shot out there hes let the offense come to him so far this season hes averaged almost 19 points per game now thats leak a cell over by the scorers table hes joined by Jeb Hartness and Les Jones and hes talking with Partners right now theyre over by that scores table now Les Jones will join them weve got 702 to go in the first half Applause and theres going to be a lot of times this year especially early Jim behind going to be talking to his young players coaching them teaching them every opportunity well whatever the delay is its been rectified and Syracuse has possession trailing 30 to 18 seven minutes to go in our first half we talked about spread it around Gerard is the only player for Syracuse to knock down a three so far hes got two of them orange also had 30 points off the bench in the win against Lehigh last Monday thats Williams and you know what hes feeling it now and because they were Colgate was daring him to take that jump shot uh they were giving him all sorts of room they may have to press out a little bit farther on him now Williams shot 34 for the floor last season quick passing from the Raiders Inside to Thompson got free you know I love talking about centers and uh in the middle of that zone uh Mr Woodward is having a very very nice game three assists for him so far that bounces off the tip Edwards over the top couldnt get to it and now Moffett runs it up Applause Syracuse a shade below 33 percent so far from the floor okay On Target son I think you know they cant be late getting to him they just cant I mean you know hes a guy that you can get you can be late to the other four guys not him now eight of 17 from Beyond 22 feet one and threequarter inches and mints has a response with a three first one of the uh his career I believe to this point but if he can expand that part of this game hes going to be very dangerous he did have 16 points against Lehigh Mike with six of nine from the floor and played 26 minutes heres the look you see its just so very creative good movement without the basketball good high low action which was very difficult against that zone normally ever since Richardson got that kind role early in the game the baskets opened up for him senior from Flemington New Jersey hes open again thats deep Applause High rebound take it down by Edwards Applause and so you can tell that he he didnt surprise nobody on the offensive glass really for Colgate getting back getting their defense set not one of giving up any transition points Edwards digging in against two Defenders got to the rim and got fouled trying to get through that double team so Edwards to the freethrow line records picked up his first and impersonal it was a and we havent said records name a lot hes a 13point scorer for them but for for Jesse Edwards that was a late double team and it wasnt well it wasnt well executed because he was able to split it and get the foul DoubleDouble against Lehigh 18 points 11 boards Edwards senior from the Netherlands Amsterdam substitution Colgate Jeff Woodward back into the lineup Keegan records leaves Edwards the youngest of three very athletic Brothers took to basketball had that injury Mikey was at Boston College did play 24 games last year but after that wrist injury could not return to the lineup for the orange and it was certainly situation that they could not recover from and did not make postseason play yeah it was a it was a very tough way for the behind Brothers to end you know but who who gets to write the fairy tale you know it doesnt happen for a lot of people and he stepped out of bounds the entire Syracuse bench made the call in fact prior to last year Mike 51 consecutive winning seasons for this program all the way back to the early 70s yeah I mean we could do a twohour show on you know what Jim behind and what this program has done under his tenure here Applause Gerard got it back in the corner Outlet pass Baker one on one against Torrance Gerard grabs it coping its been able to pick their spots and get out and run but they just havent converted on those plays tempted alleyoop Florence had to go to the floor to try to save it and then mint stepped in and created some contact with Richardson thats the first foul on Judah Mintz Colgate in front by 11 late in the first Music a new kind of state the Colgate Raiders have had the lead for the better part of his first half with just under four minutes to go against the Syracuse Orange playing in just their second game this season after a win last Monday against Lehigh last year the Raiders came to the Dome and won 100 to 85 snap a 54 game losing streak in the series Mike you mentioned it the 18 threes they made last year theyve got eight so far tonight almost there and bench points and Lynch Daniels has nine of those and up the three threes Off the Bench for him to that effort and also the offense really and running through Woodward eight assists on those made field goals as well so if things working very well for the Raiders right now youll see two game within a game you know if youre Colgate youve got this nice lead how can you finish off this half what do you do in the last four minutes to keep that lead or can Syracuse make a little run get some momentum certainly wasnt the first win in the series for Colgate which dates back to 1901 theyve won 46 times but havent been able to string together victories against the orange since the early 60s Mike when they won four in a row in the series when I was looking back and a guy that I was actually drafted with Kiki vanderway his father Ernie played here right after the war from 45 to 49 I was looking at some of the alltime leading scorers and then in the 90s a guy named Donald Foyle whos probably their most wellknown player went on an NBA career backing down Woodward too strong and thats you know what its Syracuse wants him shooting the basketball instead of Distributing like hes done so far Applause down low on the Baseline and it looks like Edwards might have stepped out Lee Cassell was right on top of the call on the Baseline yeah and were doing a nice job getting him pushed underneath the basketball you know underneath the backboard he just ran out of real estate by the way both coaches were very generous with their time to chat with us prior to the game Matt lingle very modest about his success realizes the temperamental nature of the game and Coach Boeheim what was the first thing he wanted to talk about Mike when I walked in the room with you the impact of the Liv he wanted to talk about golf yeah he loves golf loves it he was actually back in the day he was the golf coach here while he was also the basketball coach played here assistant here that actually he used to come down to the Duke childrens classic and played golf it had a hole in one wow one year in the tournament amazing Edwards high for the board I work on the PGA tour in the summertimes Mike and we wanted to talk about golf well right now hes focused on basketball I can guarantee you that with his team trailing and were going inside of three minutes in the first half Williams Behind the line he just keeps hes got those easy chippies first and he just keeps moving farther and farther out and for the first time tonight the crowds starting to get involved a little bit Mike that Williams three that Benny Williams offense I think and then number 15 you want an answer and he just keep talking about moving out he just keeps moving farther and farther away from the threepoint line his third three tonight mints individual effort crowded area defender in the air leaning in too strong Edwards able to preserve The Possession tough shot Falling Away Applause Raiders want to run disjointed play turnover Orange touchdown past the mints and he couldnt catch up with it Applause good idea lacking the execution the little fill behind right there and Im sure in The Scouting Report you know he misses only three in the first game against Lehigh but that guy you know is proven from behind the arc Benny Williams last season was one of 11 on threepointers Mike Syracuse hoping its a totally different story This Time Around in 2223 Applause Richardson again you know Gerard was in the neighborhood had his hand up but I think thats where Richardsons size comes in he can just rise up and shoot over him mints that three rattles out 16 points for Richardson hes got the ball yeah judaminsons struggling one of six now Moffett a little too much room to operate Richardson double clutch doesnt matter how about 15 in Maroon hes going to be shooting from the S pretty soon and you just you know hes youre not even thinking at this point hes just hes just reacting and letting the ball fly right now you look out hes a good three or four feet behind the line right there almost getting to in the Steph Curry range late hand up there I mean hes almost you know you almost have to give yourself up youre going to stay in the zone and just find where he is Richardson averaging 19 points on the season this Colgate team played Wells College of Aurora New York nearby Aurora out of division three on Sunday and 19360 they made 12 threes in that game Richardson in that game led the team with 15 points lost at Buffalo to start the season where he had 22 points to lead the team 105 to go in our first half Richardson 19 points this you know we were marveling at the offense and youre holding so far Syracuse sitting at 24 points so theyre getting it done both ends of the floor Applause orange last year as a team 45 from the floor that was right in the middle of the pack in the ACC so far just 32 percent as a team that will help the averages its Gerard Applause third three of the game for Joe Gerard who led the team with 19 points in their only game so far against Lehigh moffatt able to catch it driving dish Gerard does well to close on Richardson right into the defending of Edwards a better job you drive him off the threepoint line make him try to finish inside second block for Edwards thats another thing when Edwards went out Mike he was second in the conference last year with almost three blocks per game Thompson misfires bounces the turrets final 15 s first half Raiders have built a 14point lead Gerard a little casual right here with the clock running down going to do it himself steps into the three front rim so Raiders will go to the locker room mic with a 14 point lead as a team they shot 45 percent so coming up at halftime get a preview of the FIU NC State game well go around the ACC and have your first half highlights to back games in this series Mike since the early 1960s when they won in 1962 here in Syracuse it was up at manly Field House well two things for Syracuse to see if uh Judah Mintz can get things going offensively and getting into the lane and theyve got to find number 15 Mr Richardson try to calm him down this is Williams hanging and bounces out Williams was four of six shooting in the first half with nine points opening moments of the second half so glad that youre with us for ACC basketball on the Syracuse University campus another three for Colgate Mike this time its Ryan Moffett on the bottom of the on the bottom of the zone two Keegan records said a little screen to give him an extra count to get a look at the three moffats got his first three of the night Edwards ran into the double mince carving his way in mints challenged the defense and laid it in Moffett went for the steal came up empty and that gave miss a wide open Lane to the rim orange gonna have to overcome a 14 point halftime deficit in these next 18 minutes and 50 seconds thats the thing its a nice job theyre theyre trying to make Woodward shoot the basketball Applause Edwards the rejection fourth block of the night Edwards Gerard kind of got caught in the air there Mike well I know with Richardson tall enough he is really tracking Gerard its the Hustle by Richardson to go to the court and get it kick against the orange so you go for the if you go for the steal there youve got to get it but uh this guys got some great stuff in the lane finishing with his off hand eight points for mints three of eight shooting youve got a threepointer to his credit as well I think hes instead of settling for jump shots hes got to do that attack the rim getting into some sort of Rhythm then he can start moving his game outside if he wants 12 made threes for Colgate Syracuse is connected on five threes Miss fire Smith Applause Bell early jump shot with no board coverage Chris Bell freshman in the lineup for the orange Smith from the free throw line see again Woodward make him finish in there he gets everybody down and just creates a great little jump shot for Braden Smith 20 points in his first Collegiate start of his career against Buffalo in 29 minutes and the average is almost 13 per game small sample size for Colgate playing in its fourth game in nine days for that matter just the second of the season for the orange Williams another three attempt wide of the intended target yeah that shot not falling so far in the second half for Benny Williams and Richardson is staying he is staying really close to Gerard not letting him get a rhythm Applause Colgate working on an early season twogame winning streak Gerard stepping in the passing Lane brings it up crosses it over once the handle out of bounds and thats off of Gerard and good intentions on the drive just lost the handle you know if youre Colgate I mean youll accept forcing him into being a driver you dont want him teeing it up from three make him prove himself inside Torrance back into the lineup for the orange eight turnovers in total after Gerard lost it out of bounds full court pressure Gerard Taps it and that went off of Colgate he went after it with Smith that went out of bounds caught the Raiders a little flatfooted on that full court pressure thats their sixth turnover of the game Applause orange capitalized on that turnover trailing 4932 1650 to go in regulation Edwards was looking for the rim spun off went out of bounds its going to stay at this end of the floor Les Jones all over the call awarding the basketball to the orange I like the aggression by Edwards trying to get the Finish just couldnt get the dunk to go theyre just theyre theyre looking for a spark here somewhere see if Gerard can provide that spark on the handle fouled on the way up Applause Lynch Daniels taking up his third personal and thats the thing Tom defensively I mean Syracuse in their first half only six freethrow attempts so they havent been going to the line either Gerard at the line 88 last season from the line while we have a second a message from Works Nitro meet Works Nitro powerful tools for any project with gaslike power without the gas fueled by Power share batteries to give you the power to outperform so the rock Gerard who made all five of his free throw attempts in the win against Lehigh he went to the line 73 times last year and made 67 of them Richardson extending the range might have been the deepest three attempt for him in the game goes out of bounds on the Baseline and stays with Colgate that according to Jeb Hartness not a popular call inside the Dome Mike Raiders basketball Lynch Daniels put the shoulder down offensive foul his fourth nice anticipation on that play and uh and Lynch Daniels who had a big first half for him off the bench see again theyre just driving and Torrance a nice job anticipating that drive getting a body in front moving his feet get the call Lynch Daniel said nine points in that first half Gerard in Rhythm ripping the ropes for the orange and not for a lack of effort from Richardson defensively that was a tough shot four made threes Joe Gerard tapped it away two on one chance mince Gerard bounces off Applause throws it up from the corner and that was halfway down and out Applause Moffett how about Moffett with a three well this this team is so good at finding guys out on the perimeter you know and with the focus on Richardson theyre going to be looks for other guys 13 threes for Colgate thatll stay down for Williams now they attack with pressure after the make skillfully broken by Smith inside of 15 minutes to go in regulation turn around Thompson basically uncontested Mike on the turnaround well and I think hes more of a scorer inside there than Woodward is so theyre going to have to he can knock down that shot 60 percent shooting from the field in his first three games mens twisting and missing acceleration and elevation and he came up empty you try to put it up top to Thompson the ball ends up with Richardson and he rattles home a three Tucker Richardson and you know Tom not a great break and it just turns out well for Colgate and Richardson wide open on that mistake and a timeout Syracuse a careerhigh six made threes for Richardson this coach has a conversation with mints Colgate fighting for this opportunity and Richardson is on the money ridiculus 54 from Beyond The Arc theyve connected 14 times for threepointers Syracuse is six of 17 from threepoint range and Tucker Richardson 22 points hes our hearties start a watch tonight and thats a pretty good pick Mike jaminski well hes done everything in that league rookie of the year when in his first year in conference an allconference player the preseason Player of the Year this year living up to that right now and doing all that in just 25 minutes Tom but uh you know terrific and hes also rebounding got three assists as well so doing everything out on the floor 22 points just too shy of his career high of 24 we thought we talked about the 18 threes they made last year as an eyepopping number they may go past that in this game well the 18 was second most in school history the record for Colgate and program history is 19 made threes were inside of 14 minutes to go in the second half this is Mintz trying to create and he lays it in thats a Nifty move Mike yeah no hes got hes got stuff he can get to the rim off the dribble but the the thing that the Syracuse that Jesse Edwards has been very quiet in this game its got four blocks but four rebounds and only four points so far and he hasnt got many touches Thompson turnaround again I I think that Syracuse theyre going to cover up the threepoint Shooters theyll let him operate offensively in the paint area and take their chances with those shots Gerard and Williams did a doubledigit scoring for the orange Gerard with 14 Williams with 11 on 5 of 10 shooting shot clock is down to Eight Mints hits this hes had the last four now for the orange from the midrange game now starting to creep back into it 5743 after trailing by 14 at halftime Applause Moffett catch and release Thompson fighting for it saved Torrance nice recycle and thats the good look if Colgate has had that when theyve thrown over the top across Court entry Edwards as Mike mentioned just four points in the game had to kick it out Torrance Williams foul on the play against Colgate records picked up his third 5743 the lead for the visiting Raiders foreign Music Applause Music between these two teams goes back to 1901 and its time now for the Continental Tire game recap and it involves Tucker Richardson for sure GMan 22 for him and you know the thing is if you look at the numbers Colgate ridiculous from threepoint range but six of 17 from two so you know theyre going to just guard the threepoint line give up some shots maybe give up some layups and then get right here for the last 12 20 of this game get to the free throw line stop the clock muddy the game up a little bit score from there first trip to the line tonight for Benny Williams only attempted 21 free throws all season long last year and then you you know you get to the line you can set up that full court trap Applause intense defending from Torrance the Syracuse native number 10 in white back out to Baker Applause they got it back yeah Woodward you got to get a bite you know thats a rebound you have to come up with Woodward dropped it low found the open man Thompson High Low you know hes been so so good out there and then you get Thompson whos come in and even though records not having a great scoring night number third hes giving you a nice boost Raiders maintaining that 14point advantage that they had at halftime 4430 shot clock is down to 10 for the orange and mints Applause they got me may spark that this crowd was looking for immense all of a sudden waking up offensively nice to see you a lot of sometimes a freshman cant put a bad half behind him but Judah Mintz playing nicely here crowd still murmuring about the move by mince and at the other end moffatt Kansas three Applause 15 threes in the game for Colgate Gerard angular rebound to Moffett Applause foreign Applause Syracuse Orange players in double digits Torrance Gerard they give it to Edwards that is off of the Raiders diving attempt there from Chandler Baker well heres the look and uh coolshank I think that was more of a trip than anything but whatever it gave mints a great look at the rim and then Colgate as theyve done all afternoon and night answer with the three Applause behind technically Mikes sitting on 999 tonight asterisk 999 but were all in the basketball world its uh 1100 35 times to the NCAA tournament 10 times in the last 13 years 58 tournament wins thats fourth all time as well Mike 42 seasons of the 46 with winning teams 2003 national champs win against Kansas and Roy Williams who was also on that list from mints out of bounds stays with the orange Applause looking to take this game over offensively for Syracuse coach mayheim at the final four in National Championship in 87 and 96 as well and then breaking through an 03 Carmelo Anthony Jerry McNamara current assistant coach and the national title back in 03 the perk breaking jump shot by Keith smart you had to bring it up 87 against Indiana lost to Kentucky in 96 five trips to the Final Four did it most recently in 2016 also lost in the National semis back in 2013 to Michigan an amazing career shows no signs of slowing down as well Gerard trying to heat it up thats over top of backboard thatll be Colgate basketball now hes hes really the one guy you want to lock in on I you know even though mince has knocked down a three in this game I think youd prefer that and thats going to be a offensive foul on Woodward good job Gerard selling that on the pressure Applause second foul on Woodward heres the look in there thats and you know he didnt really have to do that and thats an automatic Lobby man hes got the big size advantage over Gerard he just let that right hand get the better of him chance for the orange the closest theyve been is 12 in this second half last time within double digits you have to go back to the first half at the 741 Mark so they need to chip away and do it fast they want to get back in this one mince to the court the arrow favors the Raiders or was a timeout granted yeah I think he and I was Im never a big fan of that play I think they you know they but you burn a timeout to I think a time out is more important than a possession true so with 9 33 to go the orange Mike its saying zero yeah on the on the Timeout on our stat board here okay well double check that one for you but you want to stay tuned for the fast break its presented by your local Ford dealer were getting confirmation last time out Applause utilized by the orange well keep an eye on that for you here in the in the timeout inside the Dome opened up back in 1980 how about the refurbishments to this place Mike theyve really really done a great job with it theyre going to bring in seats and replace the metal benches as well well its its beautiful from the outside in any aerial view that weve seen from it and Im frankly shocked early on when you talked about your dorm room and theres theres got to be some sort of plaque there commemorating that isnt there no plaque a little microphone or something always great to be back on campus with the GMan though I spent uh seven wonderful years here Mike oh no Im sorry it was just four John you got that John Belushi yeah yeah seven years of college down the drain not down the drain though no theyre buying the mic you know by the way theres six million pounds of structural steel on the roof looks like a roller coaster up there the support its steel design Williams aggressively against two Defenders foul was called Applause Thompson picked it up now the good news is too one more foul by Colgate and Syracuse going to be in the bonus for the rest of the game Syracuse has played to this point no foul so far in the half Williams now three or three from the line but I think this is this is the recipe for the orange get the free throw line knock them down be efficient and get into that trap that would be nine of 12 now from the freethrow line inside a nine and a half minutes to go its a 12 point lead for Colgate substitution Syracuse moner Hima comes in Edwards to the bench long Pastor Richardson he is free and he lays it in and the foul Mintz was trying to get back defensively Richardson had a step for Colgate normally youre big is back playing center field but Hema was chasing guys around and uh nice little seam route that time nice job thrown over the top too and thats what Benny Williams a tall guy right in your face too to make that play foreign line now the 24 points has tied his career high Applause cant finish off the old school threepoint play 14point lead Colgate matches the halftime lead 4430 theyve had an answer every time Syracuse has made a little bit of an inroad Williams able to save it Mintz with a glance at the clock Gerard barks out the commands Applause only five on the shot clock Torrance angling in and he plays the angle off the backboard Applause Torrance able to calculate the physics up ahead theres an open man underneath out of bounds lost out of bounds by records Eagan records he was looking at The Rim before he ever caught the ball now its just he had a couple of Defenders bearing down on him that sped things up a little bit Syracuse very so far in this in this pressure theyve gotten beaten over the top some on this possession they can cut the lead to 10 or with a three get into single digits havent done that since the early stages of the first half Gerard releases and misses Applause Richardson waiting for reinforcements patience from the Raiders threepointer has been the difference tonight theyre 15 of 29 from Beyond The Arc in the threepoint airspace they drop it low records this time hes able to hold on and the foul is called theyll give it to Hima the sophomore high low action what were they you know when he doesnt have anything out on the perimeter he looks loud and low on the Baseline records getting behind everybody on the defensive end in the game Colgate just three of five from the freethrow line Applause theyre better from three than they are from the free throw line move that line back coming back in its Edwards record senior from Rhode Island like I said hes only hes not been a big part of the scoring four points for him hes averaging almost 14 Williams tried to drop it low no Edwards yeah no real angle out there to make that pass even though you know on that turnover at least you can set your defense and and pressure the ball a little bit the other win this season was on the road at Brown for Colgate in Providence Rhode Island last Thursday 7768 to beat Wells College division three on Sunday 9360 lost over the season at Buffalo Richardson Gerard is on him gives up a couple of inches at The Rim records he read it well he knew that Smith shot was off the mark and so many times the offense will go up and take a chance on that defensive player a little reluctant he doesnt want to get into a goaltending call right there but Im going to give him an assist on that I think quick ball movement s got two men in the air Torrance with eight on the shot clock fancy dribble Edwards down the lane contact Woodward was defending 55 in Maroon thatll be his third personal so the foul against the Raiders theyve got the 6852 lead in the second Applause foreign presented by your local Ford dealer early on in the ACC season and we

for the orange Torrance to the bench yeah I mean you know we talk about the mid majors and uh this team maybe above that label from Colgate and its a very challenging you get the turnover by Mintz in the open floor great defensive Play Just mantoman so the lead is back to 12 thats the closest the orange have been in the second half they had a possession where they had a chance to get it to 10 or single digits but Gerard misfired on a three a couple of minutes ago or inside of seven minutes now Richardson watch out yeah and only but again you get the Miss and you give up the offensive rebound and for Richardson only five points in this half so theyve kept him relatively quiet Applause three Lynch Daniels hes been hes been uh chippy with the crowd a little bit Darren but he backed it up with some threepoint shooting and then the turnover 16 points for Lynch Daniels wide open from the corner another three Breton Smith for the Raiders all right they have answered every single run by Syracuse in this game had it down to 12 just a hard fee to go Colgate comes up with back to back threes Lynch Daniels and Smith on successive possessions Applause mince had to flip it over to Gerard and now Edwards Williams Copeland looks like everybody touched the basketball unable to harvest points and Colgate calls a timeout Applause 7456 5 43 to go in regulation heres the look inside and uh talk about a you know nice addition off of the bench four of six shooting 12 points for him bench 244 advantage in this game for Colgate and its not like theyve played a cast of thousands either theyve made 17 threes they made 18 in the upset win last season inside the Dome 50 percent from threepoint distance well and the thing now too with Syracuse theyre sitting well only two team fouls so theyre gonna have to go some if theyre going to have to you know stop the clock and get the put Colgate on the line you know I think at this point you almost sell out and try to go for the steal almost on every possession here unless you can get a really strong early double team largest lead right now 18 points for Colgate thanks to that man this is a North Carolina amber alert for a child

we talked about that hes got some new faces theyve got two new guys on the sideline Cameron Crocker Trey Montgomery this guys got a pin ties but hes got a coachs staff up as well as coaching his team up yeah langel graduated from Penn in 2000 Edwards Copeland back to Edwards and he rolls it in that one good job of not again making it a threepoint play opportunity you get the layup you can you know Let it go foreign for Moffett on the Baseline got out of the double team Smith in records Applause Smith Lynch Daniels I missed everything Lauren just a hurry up well not a lot of you know Torrance was way ahead of the crowd and then just a careless pass through turnover 7458 328 on the clock uphill climb late for the orange Applause by CPI Security its Benny Williams for the orange Mike jaminsky yeah I mean theyve had some shot blocks in this game uh five total for Syracuse but there hadnt been a ton of action inside and of course Penny Williams nice job on the offensive glass I mean hes hes had a very good game statistically 157 rebounds for him foreign high for Benny Williams shattered his old career high might be in a losing effort tonight Mintz he got tangled up there Braden Smith thats the third foul on Mintz 17 of 35 and threepoint shooting for Colgate just up the road in Hamilton New York Mike 59 miles Southeast of the Dome Applause town but they got a big time program there small enrollment under 3 000 students the group that came to the Dome tonight though is ready to play Early season basketball keep in mind the orange had only played one game prior to tonight as well not trying to make any excuses certainly but you know against this defense and uh this opposing teams dont always have a great shooting night in this building but you take 35 threes and knock down half of them youre going to be in most games just 36 percent shooting as a team for the orange in this one up to this point with 245 to go on the clock mince the high Parker and hes going to the freethrow line now we talked about the last thing you want to do and that that was a tough finish in and of itself but dont stop the clock and give him an opportunity you know to get on the line thats four on records hell get go to the Colgate bench and minces at the freethrow line freshman from Fort Washington Maryland out of Oak Hill Academy Mount the Wilson Virginia fourth place old school threepoint play again the closest the orange got here in the second half was 12 right now its 13 Raiders are going to use that clock Woodward backs it out Lynch Daniels Edwards high for the rebound as he secures it up to Torrance and you can see Colgate has been so good getting back defensively Edwards yeah nice finish there so now two minutes remaining 11 point game full time this is the closest the orange has been all half Applause kick out Woodward Richardson that could be some punctuation right there Mike James yeah yeah and you know its funny to maintain that lead without him being a huge part of the offense certainly a lesser of a role than he was in the first half 18 threes Williams offensive board in the put back thats thats backtoback years coming into this building and putting up 18 threes but a much a much more efficient percentage this year than last year Richardson another three for Richardson 27 points setting his career high tonight seven made threes thats also a career high and nine of 14 overall last year it was Jack Ferguson leading the way for Colgate with 25 points Applause not surprisingly those 27 from Richardson leading all scorers in our game tonight as we close in on the final minute Raiders throw it out of bounds theres a pulse it might be faint but theres a pulse theyre not bad 13 turnovers on the game for Colgate so that a decent number on the road Woodward to the bench for Colgate really a big part of what they did this evening yeah theyll play Friday against Duquesne Mike first Patriot League game at the end of December against Loyola Maryland Applause mints threads the pass knocked away from Williams Applause expression of frustration and Williams fouls Moffett had to with 39 seconds left from the game clock and the folks who made the trip from Hamilton New York applauding their Raiders its like half the town came up for this game well worth the trip I mean two years in a row after losing 54 in a row in the series and theyre on the threshold of doing it for a second straight year Applause score holds they go to three and one as well early on es will drop to one and one for the win against Lehigh last Monday theyll play Saturday against Northeastern four oclock out of the corner three ball Corner Pocket from Moffett thats 19 threes to tie the school record Applause Miss from Taylor Torrance got it back and theres the whole night right there in a nutshell yeah no just not being able to finish at The Rim and then you know they just couldnt match the threepoint shooting for the Raiders terrific win on the road Torrance hits a three not gonna be nearly enough 80 to 68 for the second straight Year Matt lengle and the Raiders come to the Dome and leave with a win it was impressive and you know the thing Tom for me is that you know they jumped on Syracuse early got a lead but whenever the orange tried to make a little bit of a run and cut the lead down they had an answer for it and uh you know
