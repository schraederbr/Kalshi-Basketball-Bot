dont worry about dont look forward dont worry about the percentages everything is on the line must take care of business now Virginia wins the tip in the road blue Wake Forest in the home goal did you catch that I said we I got to stop I I was going to give you a hard time Im going to give you one Mulligan youre mentioning Mig Ill give you one off the top you know were coming up on the 30year anniversary of uh that special week of the ACC tournament touches some slack as Virginia opens the score you mentioned it this is a Cavaliers team that won four of five before losses to Duke in North Carolina theyve been playing their best basketball of the Season demon Deacon starting five as they look to bounce back after that tough loss at edsy State over the weekend right down the lane Hunter Salis hammers at home talk about two pretty good defensive teams lapses on the first possession both ways that time cavalieres biggest problem is containing the dribble got to find a way to its not a good sign you got to find a way to contain the basketball but Virginia defensively has given up the paint this season a lot more than in years past dday Ames pull up pop draws the foul Ames has come on really strong in the last six games he has been a focal point Hunter silus has to have more bodies in front of him in the basket that time its too easy he turns the corner at his size youve got to get in front of him good sign for the de to Hunter St getting to the Rim Early that spins off the rim it was halfway down from ases you mentioned the last six games 15 and a half points per game shooting better than 50 this is a big reason why Virginias improved on the offensive end him coming alive hes the one guy Co Sanchez allows to shoot midrange jump shots and now having a point guard on the floor he gets roie back to help with ball handling so he doesnt have one guy that has to dominate the basketball and that point guard match up for both teams is huge wakes had its fair share issues at the point guard spot finding some consistency throughout the season cam hilden sends it down low the Spillers and he is fouled before Fon Reed tipped it Applause in W doing a really good job of getting their bigs the ball on on the move they have to because you know coming in Virginias going to trap the post if you try to play postups getting Spillers on the Move whos been I think great for the decks one of their unsung heroes his activity I think particularly in the rebounding department when wake is at their best theyre winning the battle on the glass they lost it on the road to NC State big reason they lost that game well I think its been an issue the last couple of games wake on a season is losing the rebounding battle theyve given up 10 or more offensive rebounds the last three games and the one game they won they gave up 17 that was at LSU so both teams have struggled rebounding the basketball be interesting who can sure that upout the Applause game R for is certainly looking to get off to a better start than they did Saturday fell down 11 nothing in that game Virginia wants to get back to winning ways after backtoback losses Elijah Saunders knocks down the triple this is a different team because one theyve gone back to their move of blocker and with made Tony Bennett offense so great its just the you have to guard everyone on the floor its constant movement constant F re cleaning up the spill on the offensive glass youre right you mentioned the switch with their offensive philosophy exp spurred those four wins in five games and even in the losses to Duke in North Carolina more competitive in those losses particularly against Duke a top team than they were in the losses earlier in the ACCC Applause play this is a team in Virginia that only finds itself a half game back of the nine seed which would give them a first round Buy in the ACC tournament and yet its so congested there that they still havent even secured a spot in that tournament a win tonight on the road would go a long way for Ron Sanchez in this virgin ji your team we talked so much about it but both teams are playing for something youre playing proceedings in the ACC tournament even the de theyre playing to get the double by B near wide open usually will make you pay Miss fires Applause there its got to be some better communication for the deak on the weak side you dont want to leave ACC percentage wise best threepoint shooter Applause open Reed posting up they floated to him a foul call The Freshman Jacob Kofi forced a foul read Eon Reed could be a problem tonight against a very young and you know for ACC standard weaker front line than Virginia presents well its an inexperienced front line hes a veteran guy with a physical Advantage inside and you see theyre trying to front when possible because if they get caught behind theyre going to come and double Fon Reed does a really good job when he faces up passing out of the double team so to try to front him so they can keep him matched up on the weak side and this young front Court a little depleted tonight without Anthony Robinson Spillers Cashes in with a flush underneath Dam hell just with a great screen there level Sanders got Spillers a free bucket thats something thatll show well on filmy back door pass finds roie for an easy finish theyve had that opportunity a few times and thats part of what we talking about the move of blocker you worry about the threepoint shooting its a back door cuts and rim Cuts got to be careful of nobody picks up hildr and thats an easy lay in for two two teams that have struggled on the offensive end of the floor not having any troubles here to start its easy baskets at The Rim a couple of defensive breakdowns for both teams early McNeely fading away he hits he is a difficult shot maker and has that in his game and dting AES being on the floor with him the believe he GES Su pressure wake gets into the lane again hild cant finish Applause Music Applause it Ames pulls up and knocks it down Virginia back to back baskets to go up by three early Music this is a confident team uh this team is playing better they they feel comfortable where they are right now Music and Salis answers on the other end you let him get there his money thats his shot he gets to that ACC and elevates it its good a midrange game as youll see in college basketball Music right now both teams defensively are spread out everybodys worrying about their man its got to be more of a group multiple guys defending the basketball not just guarding your man Saunders lines up the three rolls off no good even that shot thats a good shot teams are missing theyre not making each other Miss Saunders gets up and swaps it away denying Reed up ahead T Murray scooped to the hoop for two two turnovers on a de trying to force the ball inside its a difficult pass trying to throw it over the Music top Virginias connected on four of their last five shots and the one miss was a wide open look getting what they want on the road early against a Wake Forest team that is the last team in Joe lardys projected field of 68 a must win tonight for the Demon Deacons here at home cam hild delivers at the end of the shot clock theres no shot blocking on the floor for the Cavaliers so deak should just put their head down and attack the paint theres a size Advantage inside and theres no Rim protection for the Cavaliers not often you could say that going against the Virginia team in the last decade but they have struggled to get in front of offensive players this season and a foul years or so they want to finish the year all strong re comes up empty on the out of bounds play a Wake Forest before that Miss had made six of their first eight shots 75 and yet trailing by one neither of these teams can seem to get a Applause stop what you got to be concerned about the decks is again your guards are going to spend a ton of energy guarding the basketball foul called on the fresh Juke Harris reached in on mcne you do so much chasing and its this nonstop movement for guys like Hunter Sil and cam hild they play 35 Plus minutes a game and theyre going to be doing a lot of chasing on top of the offensive load that they have to carry for the deakes the hunter Sal dis played 158 in the last 160 minutes in the last four games for Wake Forest cant afford to him off the court hes guarding mcne here M got a shot off from Miss fires great job by Hunter charot there chasing him off the screen stand in front of the basketball making mly shoot a contested Applause Music too shot block down to 10 heres J Caris backing down Murray kicks out for Salis Salis in attack mode pull up pop sticks it good shot as youll see there he gets to that ACC line its money you can count it and he is a perfect three for three the Wake Forest is not even attempted to three they have had their way going inside on Virginia as they should zero Rim protection for Virginia you can leaves it for Murray easy uncontested layup both teams are struggling to have Five Guys guarding a basketball right now what you that to I think its because of just Virginias worried about the Deep size and side you can see theyre trying to run their offense after Reed is that was a pass to Reed and it goes in for three hild cant believe it hey hell claim it its a three it goes in the book as a three were going to count it as a shot so bad of a pass it was a good Applause Music Applause shot whatever it takes for the de to knock in a three thats what cam H says NE answers with a three on the other end and fires Virginia back in front you got to get up on the ball screen with him you cannot be back in the paint after reading these guys I know what youre thinking you got to help on the back cup but you also got to be up on the ball screen when he had when MCN had the basketball ild that time did successfully get it to read a spins his way free lays it up and in so crafty Day Day Ames great move great finish with another turnover there by the DS theyve got to take do a better job of taking care of the basketball rejection at the rim and a foul called Kan Murray uh Juke Carris heres the deal hes typically right so I dont know if thats good news or bad news for Wake Forest the good news is right now you are projected in the field the bad news is theres bid Steelers thatll come during champ week and you dont have any margin for error unless you beat Toth on big Monday and again being the last team in is something you dont want to be because again thats the first team that gets bumped by right and are thats thats going to happen so you got to come out with a sense of urgency and take care of business thats just what the decks May must do everything that they want to achieve is in in their hands and right now trailing by two Virginia playing very well offensively shooting 64 from the field charma has to hoist it good defense there out of the timeout by Wake Forest want to see more of that for the deeps there just hasnt been much resistance but again like we talked about this is a different Virginia team this theyre not tning the basketball one theyre going to theyre going to get good shots up you have to force them to miss Applause Music Applause shots theres Salis working against Andrew roie shot clock down to six coms up short on the three thats a shot i like to see Hunter side continue staying Attack Mode dont settle again theres no Rim protection for Virginia got to the paint at will just continue to drive the basketball like that mcy on the drive largest lead of the night for Music Virginia and wer is gone with Omaha blue with the five so theyre playing small ball and Sal that midrange showing off again just every time he gets it get down he get in the paint as good a midrange game as youll see in college basketball theres never reason for him to settle and particularly in a game like this when youre playing against a team and you identify early theres no one to alter your shot when you get in paint and Virginia has shown no resistance to it no tunders double team mused it but everything but the Finish he lost the ball right as he was about to throw it Applause down Saturday Sonic Blockbuster on ABC one Easter time number one Auburn in lexiton to take on Kentucky you dont want to miss it Auer well on their way to being the number one overall seed in the NCAA tournament Wake Forest just hoping to be the 68th team in the field last team in according to Joe lonardi and do you think that affects the way a team plays just play a little tighter when you know theres no margin for error as roie PS it in all right weve had both teams had H merry threes already this game so were even yeah hildr you missed it earlier passed one in he looking for a lob deed read and that floated in and then roie Banks a heave off the glass in yeah theres not a bank in America open at 900 at night at night here but again both teams are playing well offensively theyre scoring there Little Resistance from either team man I dont know who would favors yet because both teams have had struggles on the offensive end of the floor but going back to what I asked you just before the Wake Forest look theyre they they read everything right they know that the loss to Florida State here at home was a dent to the resume then you lose to an NC State team that struggled this season so they know their backs are against the wall as you said theyre out of Mulligans yes and it just feels like they played a little tight here at home against Virginia so far in this first half well you cant avoid it everyones talking about it these kids are hearing it they see it on tter social media or any platform that theyre using you hear it around town this community this fan base everybodys itching for this team to get in a tournament and its just time its time for the decks to make a push and get in the tournament theyve been knocking on the door been here before the last four years youve been a bubble team and its just time to take a step and get in and yeah there just no other way to say it Murray off balance cant finish Applause it but what you have to do is you got to trust the work you put in confidence comes from preparation and you cant have these type of turnovers there theyre unfortunately just careless with the basketball and again difference is that Virginia doesnt turn the basketball over Kofi Rock the rim how about the Freshman Jacob Applause Kofi another penetration again with this lineup wake has their small now and theres no Rim protection for either team you just got to drive the Music basketball Virginia has quieted this late night crowd a sixpoint lead on the road for the Cavaliers hildr comes up empty wake has only made one field goal the last five minutes right back to Kofi open again and Spillers was late to get there and commits some foul thats just a bad defensive possession there not coming back not matching up not communicating but down and thats been the side of the floor that they theyve leaned on all year long thats carried them and right now theyre struggling that into the floor theyre searching for answers right now because theyre giving up everything theyre giving up theyre not communicating with defensive end and the shots that Virginia has missed theres only been a couple possessions where the de the des played really good defense as good as Virginia shooting theyve missed a couple of wide open shots who sharing the ball very well in this first half eight of their 12 makes have been assisted this is their largest lead of the night Wake Forest in an eightpoint hole theyve said it throughout the night no margin for error for Wake Forest if they want to go dancing finally under Steve Forbes theyve got to win all their home home game says our bracketologist Joe lardy starting with tonight heres Salis hes been money in the midrange muscles it up didnt get a clean look tapped out to AES and Virginia slows things down its been played in Virginias pace of this first half and the Cavaliers have been terrific offensively shooting 60 from the floor Kofi draws the foul again young Jacob Kofi has had a phenomenal first half Virginias playing with confidence in their patience theyre getting the shots theyre getting the ball to their spots the decks are playing a little bit too much oneonone a frustrating first half for Steve fores particularly on the defensive end r at Thursday Prime Time womens basketball double header tips off seven Eastern on Tobacco Road North Carolina and Duke and then its the reigning champ South Carolina at all misss at ACC SEC double header on Thursday now if youre wait for us just settle down run your offense rely on your execution ball movement dont try to dig into this lead yourself dont try to make plays on your own just run your offense two and a half minute scoring drown for the DS and a foul call on the floor Virginia had the foul to give thats why I think the DS can run their offense do F Reed a lot more hes a really good passer hes looking over top of this double team and when he knows its coming he knows where his weak side where his Cutters are coming from and hes a really good passer Salis gets to that ACC logo and Cashes in again money shot I mean he gets there you can cter you got to try to keep him out the middle of the floor pin him on the side he gets to the middle leag ACC thats just as high percentage shot as you can find scoring has not been the problem for Wake Forest in this first half can they finally stream together some stops someone else has to step up because hes doing a lot of chasing list into the floor and thatll take his toll in the second half you Canon free flies to the rim and misses Applause it the Wake Forest defense will get a stop any which way and they go on the other end cam hildr defense into offense yeah you get a stop you get get a chance to pushing and get some easy baskets but still got to be concerned thats a point blank layup that was just missed that ribs out for mne Here Comes Hunter Salis leaves it for Johnson T the paint play off this is the layup though yeah keep attacking the paint play off two feet its good sh he got to the Music rim this is he to the floor for the Wake Force if you want to take control of this game defensive end has to pick up Saunders in attack mode spins into Spillers and a Applause Music travel I dont know where the DS would be without Trayvon Spillers I mean he hes his motor his activity what hes brought in the defensive end to the floor offensive rebounding he has been as consistent of a player that theyve had outside of Hunter Sal hildr has a step trying to kick it to the corner ricochets to Salis lines up the three cant hit it good possession with the D that you know you take those Applause shots there one thing I think the deakes have missed with a guy like goopy Miller was Hunter Sil is threepoint percentage has struggled some because he hasnt gotten looks like that right now Wake Forest with their backs against the wall trailing by five Virginia looked real good at this first half on the road athletes get through doing his time here he he means and meant the world to me getting through wake and honored to call him a friend and he also could add one more record hed be the all time leading score if he was allowed to play as his freshman as a freshman back then couldnt play yes and no threepoint line oh he would have had it comfortable but I pick on him cuz I say hes from New York so hes from New York he cant shoot anyway New York guards cant shoot so well he certainly Charlie I love you he can you didnt want to get into a free throw shooting contest with did not I did not at all 87 career wow yeah he could he could play he was a great one unbelievable human being right now demon deak trailing by five roie wow puts hildr on the the floor and buries it Andrew Ro and that sums up this first half for Virginia yeah he I thought he was going wave at him tell him to get up I tell you what this is a Cavaliers team that has picked up where they were before the losses of Duke of North Carolina they had won four of their last five they had found their best basketball of the season and this has been a statement first half against a desperate wake team wake is scoring the basketball they just got to they stops offer a little bit more resistance and thats too easy MCN nothing but the bottom of the net buries another one ESPNU all ACC matchups still to come SMU at Cal SMU battling on the bubble the Wake Forest got that huge win at SMU and yet during a three game stretch where you go on the road play SMU at Florida State here at home and NC State on the road you lose two of those three and the one you won was the hardest of the three and now youre struggling again at home down eight to Virginia its okay to losing games in a conference right in a normal year in a normal time but were just not in that and and I think its you they their Novembers win loss schedule not beating AM not beating Xavier uh not winning some of those games earlier I think its put so much pressure on this team late in the year and thats a lot to overcome and this team has been great in conference play in these last couple years but however you feel about the ACC its just it had you know theyre not getting enough teams in the tournament and right now theyre going to be lucky if we if the ACC can get four teams in and Wes has been that team thats been right there but theyve lost those type of games and you cant help but feel the pressure a play and Steve Forbes told us its Groundhog Day hes been living this for the last four seasons where you get to the end of February beginning of March youre right on the bubble and they have failed to do what it takes wave off that Andrew roie three foul on Kofi for setting an illegal screen heres the thing for w two possession game youre only down six despite all the success Virginia has had offensively in this first half still an opportunity to come back and win this game and I dont think thats a foul I I just think cam Hill just was selling the foul because he was beat on the screen and great play by him but Kofi was standing there for that screen it looked like a legal Applause Music screen double team Reed passes out of it finds hildr open three cant connect offensive rebound keeps it alive travel Ty Lord Johnson indecisive there caught between a pass and a shot and he turns it over yeah thats another one of those unforced turnovers there you got to get up shots against this team because Virginia like we talked about they dont turn the basketball over and you have got to get up shots right now theyre scoring a basketball but this is being played at the pace that they want and there hasnt been really a lot of resistance theyve just missed shots Applause Music Applause Kofi tries it and hits that is within his range he can make that 17 FP pullup jump shot Virginia has a high low action themselves Cavaliers shooting 60 in this first half Hunter Salis big time three nothing but the bottom of the net what you want to see as a deepan hunter Sil staying in attack mode just a much better shooter I think from behind the threepoint line off the catch so much more efficient offensively when hes off the ball and really aggressive mcne answers on the other end Isaac mcne use it or lose it timeout for Isaac MCN three made threes of this first half hes got Virginia up by eight on the road against a desperate Wake Forest team fighting for their NCAA tournament lives their resume cannot afford a third loss in four games Salis pull up pop missed it hes had 13 points in this first half but cant finish that one yeah Virginia went to a zone that time DS had a good shot I thought hun should have stepped into that three and taking it instead of taking the midrange jump shot a step back three drills it Day Day ases and Virginia finishes this first half shooting light St performance when you gave up 133 you didnt defend the way you needed to be and that was your calling card on the season thats a disappointing half on the defensive end you have 20 minutes to come out and compete on the defensive end of the floor you cant allow this Virginia team that has struggled offensively all year shoot 63 from the field theyve had their way theyve really had Little Resistance youll score enough points to win can you get enough stops to win 20 minutes to save the Wake Forest season come up empty on the opening possession Virginia dont let the score fool you this was played at their Tempo they were just highly efficient 63 from the field that would be a season high and Andrew Roy picks up where the Cavaliers left off they lead by 13 again its another Easy Shot Defender trailing just not much resistance there thats been a theme of the first half and its carrying over into the second half y Randolph I dont want to be too critical of Steve Forbes and wake fors but you would not know by looking at the way theyve played energy wise that this was a Do or Die game for them well its they have to bring the energy you cant rely on the fans thats the nervous crowd from the fans the nervous energy from them you have to come out and play and my concern for them is that just the defensive into the floor offensively theyre fine they still shot themselves over 54 they will score enough points to win its just this send them to floor theyre not offering enough resistance you cannot trade baskets because tonight UVA team is making shots Isaac big ding leading the Cavaliers with 13 day day ases he was brilliant in the first half going to work again finds Saunders open three got it I dont I dont even know what to say its just been the same thing every possession I mean just an open look out throw an open look and as you said Wake Forest keeps answering on the offensive end but they cant string together stops to close this Gap wait on the offensive end of the floor continue to attack the paint theres no theres no shot block turn the corner here Tyler Johnson gets to the rim takes the contact gets a chance to get to as I say the favorite saying in in basketball General is and one he finishes his first bucket of the night making a threepoint play Virginia still in the drivers seat at the start of this second half though an 11point lead now theyre going with their Zone and again with the shooting from Virginia you got to be concerned about it scramble for the ball Spillers on the floor jump ball possession arrow stays with Virginia c4s trying to do something different knows his team needs a boost going to his 131 Zone and Virginia was talking to us about it earlier they were telling me they were concerned about the Zone because they werent sure if they were going to be making shots oh theyre making them well theyre making them tonight shooting 64 from the field lot of time left not on the shot clock though shot clock down to two McNeely doesnt realize it and thats a violation great defensive possession everybody needs string them along defensively they play off what they call kills meaning three in a row how many stops can they get decks need to challenge themselves on the defensive end the floor how many kills can they get to take control of this second half Johnson feeds to Reed and hes fouled so Fon Reed heads to the line for two free Music throws the P the fouls are starting to pile up for the Virginia front line be interesting to see yeah well coach Sanchez go to Zone himself to try to protect his bigs and we mentioned it early in the first half but Virginia without Anthony Robinson tonight so a depleted front court and Kofi and Buchanan each with three fouls and thats why I said had if you had Robinson and you would have had a third body you would have had 15 fouls for Hunter Salas and Trayvon Spillers inside with these guys and and if rake force is going to come back I think its through Fon Reed yeah hell get a spare share of touches because the double teams coming how does he handle the double team and W stays in that 131 matchup they keep the ball out of the middle of the paint but the corner threes are open if they continue to move the basketball and Virginias hit seven threes in this game so far they come up empty on that possession Id like to see wait when they get a rebound push it in Tempo Spillers cant pass out of the double team re gathers it in the corner Johnson step back three missed Applause it think if you wait for us again said it several times attack the rim theres just not much resistance at The Rim the officials are call in the contact youre driving it no need to settle 24 of wakes 40 points have been scored in the paint let your threes come from dribble penetration no need to settle at all and with all the success Hunter Salis had early in this game I would just have it all go through 23 in Gold well thats the way its been all year long but again hes spending a lot of energy hes chasing like he is mcne on this plate he has to defend and spend a lot of energy and mcne counted plus the Music foul gets the better of Hunter Salis there and thats my thats my concern for wck Force its because Hunter Silas has to score but hes chasing mcil does a great job of getting in front cutting him off and tried to contest that fall way but MCN gives it a shot fake takes the contact and it end one how many times you going to do that in the second every time they do 12point lead for Virginia three and a half minutes into the second half wakes forest with their backs against the wall hildr down the lane nobody picked him up an easy two its not a complicated game continue to put your head down get to the rim Applause we talked about Virginias front line its in foul trouble and now this zone is causing Virginia some trouble can wake speed up the Cavaliers they played it at their Pace thus far and remember Kofi has three fouls he can ill afford to pick up his fourth here Salis patient now fires cant connect like to seeing Hunter Silas take it the first time and no hesitation just stay in Rhythm such a really good shoot in Rhythm Rhythm three there thats Off the Mark Reed fouled on the rebound a wake for is battling but its Virginia in control a 10point Music lead it was a good move I dont need to be reminded it was 30 years ago man no its nothing like like the ACC tournament I dont care what they say its still the the premier event and in my opinion it it should remain in Greensboro from here on out I get all them moving around lets get that ACC tournament back in Greensboro and leave it Wake Forest fans watching this game that might be the first time theyve smiled tonight watching that that crossover well they may have smiled at the def I mean the offensive been for the decks but they hadnt smiled with the defensive end of the floor a lot of work to do a lot of time here to play but the turnovers wont help theyre unforced turnovers and I think thats the concerning part is that when youre pressing thats some a team thats pressing very similar way to how they lost the game on Saturday just felt like pressing tight the energy just wasnt there on the defensive end of the floor good stop there trust your work dont try to do it yourself dribble in the paint pass it creat opportunities for someone else ildr cleans up his own spell I watch these guys practice that when The Bigs post up and their Defenders behind they seal it guards do a great job of dribbling pass getting to the rim and finishing is DS now back into that Applause zone Murray leaves it for Kofi goes right into Reed and is foul great job there by Mar flashing up behind Trayvon Spillers in the zone Spillers is there trying to keep the ball out of the middle that ball gets to the middle des got to race out to the corners to take away that three in any Zone you play ball gets to the middle of the floor there just nothing you can do yeah you get it to that soft spot in the zone and its trouble just scrambling at that point Juke Harris checks in for the demon another thing Steve Forbes has to balance here is more or less hes been playing six guys yes they extend it to eight with beloo and Frederickson but really its a sixman rotation for wake forist and as youve said many times tonight Rand off the way Virginias playing offensively theyre making them work well I worry about Cam hildon and and Hunter Silas because theyre going to expend so much entity chasing defensively that what would I do to them on the offensive end can someone else canf the re step up on the defensive end the offensive end the someone else got to carry him on the offensive end goes right at Kofi playing with three fouls its an 114 Wake Forest run to cut the Virginia lead to seven nearly got a look didnt take it Applause though roie shot clock down to 10 great move its making this offense stagnant they cant move it forcing Viria just to make shots now shot clock down to three Murray has to hurry hook shot doesnt fall wake for is finally stringing together some stops Virginia has not made a basket in the last three minutes its aoud wake to cut this lead to seven so pushing and shoving between roie and hildr Fon Reed getting in the middle of it tempers flaring here on a Wednesday night in the ACC Steve Forbes way off his bench both coaches know the moment right now and the momentum is starting to shift back toward wake and wakes playing hard and roie didnt take kind and he and cam hilds arms get locked up there Brody and hillers Tangled Up I dont think theres anything malicious there just two guys getting Tangled Up In the Heat of the Moment hey lets throw the ball out in play the intensity of this game was just picking up love to see the fight and actually this could be a bad thing for Wake fors because the momentum was starting to swing their way and I think the last thing you wanted to see if youre a wake Force fan is just stopping action theres no foul on the dead ball activity wake Force ball thats the right call and they did it quickly which is I think is critical take a peak make a decision lets go keep this games going start the pick up Music here really feels like for the first first time all night Wake Forest has grabbed momentum in this game well they generated some level of intensity and a crowd now starting to get involved and that allows you to feed off that a little bit but now Virginia goes to their Zone Spillers cant connect on the three got a good look thats not the guy you want taking the three theres a guy named Hunter Solus out there he get first shot and then cam healed it to Juke Harris mcne contested and he buries it they put it on the scoreboard as a three itll be reviewed at our next TV Music timeout J went to their Zone one possession now theyre back to manto man and again dont settle attack the rim Sal does just that in attack mode and delivers Music one thing that 131 does with size Hunter silus is Big guard hes forcing you to throw over the top H misses it not a lot of ball movement Zone has been really effective against Virginia forcing him to settle passing the ball around the threepoint line and not attacking the paint anymore its certainly taken Virginia out of their Rhythm and allowed Wake Forest to capitalize just just like that two possession game the Wahoos lead is down to six and the Wake Florest crowd comes to life for the first time tonight deep three MC NE cant quiet the crowd the zone is frustrating Virginia hild feeling it right now hes got 17 tried to pass out of the double team stolen away by Music Applause roie roie leaves it for Kofi and hes fouled home fans dont like it Jacob Kofi at the line when we come back Virginia leading by Applause Music six time but you see the defensive intensity for Wake for is pick up now the zone is a big part of that its eliminated all the ball movement and the penetration that Virginia was getting on the offensive end of the floor theyve got staged in the ball just moving from side to side theyre settling for jump shots and its allowed weight to it attack on the other end of the floor Steve Forbes would Wake Forest theyre not the only team playing for something obviously the Demon Deacons right on that NCAA tournament bubble Ron Sanchez told us look we feel like we could still Ure a first round Buy in the ACC tournament get up to as high 89 seed down the stretch of this season they have played like in tonight I told you this before I think since theyve gone back to their MO their mover blocker offense I think it settled them down and I think its they had issues with point guard play as ases was adjusting Ro had missed some games I think the the demise of Virginias defense has been over exaggerated theyre only giving up 66 points a game they struggled scoring the basketball and when you struggle to score it just puts too much pressure on your defense and Ron Sanchez wont panic in this sit he has a calming demeanor about him now they scored plenty tonight 57 points already over the last decade 57 is usually good enough to win it well before the game was 60 whoever got the 61st one and usually that was Virginia Fon Reed tough take on the inside to cut it to Applause five for as well as Virginia has played offensively tonight only one made field goal in the last 6 minutes for the Cavaliers roie deep three hits it great ball movement there that time they passed the ball inside to get the Deon Applause suck in the paint lose Shooters you got to know where roie and you got to know where MCN is at all times in that Applause zone hrth been very aggressive count it plus the foul cam hriff he not a tougher player in Wake fors basketball right now and cam H just puts his head down drives it again no need to settle Little Resistance at The Applause Rim cam hildr has taken over this second half if he hits this free throw hell have 20 he missed it last five games 21 points per game and more of that tonight he has turned into a consistent scorer down the stretch of this season well when youre a senior and youre running out of game theres a level of desperation that takes over as well muray open in the corner he buries it backto back threes for Virginia and the Cavaliers back up by nine well theyre starting to find H in that zone knocking down back to back threes lets see if they stick with it I think one more three pors may be forced to go to their manto man hildr called for a travel before he knocks down the jumper everything going through cam hildr offensively for Wake Forest right now defensively youre right great adjustment at first with the zone now Virginia backto back threes a decision to be made by Steve fors going right back hes going to the manto Applause man man you got to chase you got a lock and Trail and Chase Virginia nine of 18 from three AES knockdown jumper Virginia cant miss right now coach Steve fores is frustrated with his team right now they just have not guarded well and they manto man Time Out w Forest its this is now or never well it its it seems that way that this game means this much but again its not over plenty of time and then again if you lose this game it puts it puts all the pressure that you have to go win the game in cam at that point but it doesnt matter because I dont think the not the Dame game or the Jordan Tech game will be easy Fon Reed a grown man move count it plus the foul Fon Reed dominating on the glass against an inexperienced and depleted Virginia front Court without Anthony Robinson tonight that is a grown man rebound there fights the defender off get off me rebounds it goes up strong and its the fourth foul on Blake Buchanan who is helpless by Fon Reed he has will Wake Forest in this second half if the guards just continue to drive the basketball and if the bigs rotate over there is no one stopping F re from cleaning up the glass so thats on the guard to continue to put pressure on the rim but right now theyre backing their man and man this wake for his team when the defensive end to the floor theyve got to guard theyve got to sit down show a level of toughness and guard the basketball Music Applause Ro fouled shooting three cam hildr commits the foul and that is a costly whistle because Andrew roie will get three free throws here the efforts there just got to cant fou a threepoint shooter I know its tough youre trailing hes knocked down a couple the threes Applause here this is not who you wanted the line although Ro misses his first usually a terrific free throw shooter at 82 on the Music season now rattles home 10o lead now for Virginia Applause only one for three on that trip to the line for roie eldri goes into three Virginia players and draws a foul in the zone you dont have to tell Cam H to attack hes going to get to the paint does a great job of playing off two feet draws the foul comes up empty from the free throw line you can see the frustration from the senior Applause hildr you dont know if its confident from from missing free throws hes had a great game or is it fatigue I mean as we talked about it hes expending a lot of energy not just on the offensive end in the floor hes chasing either Roy or mcil off these ball screens and in this whe action this nonstop movement from their guards Virginia has made their last three Applause shots its a ninepoint Cavaliers lead on the road trying to burst Wake Forest bubble ases that rims out no good up ahead risky pass it pays off Trayvon Spillers with a rack Applause attack great defensive possession there by DS Spillers gets out ahead of the defense and throw it over can you continue to string together stops they get another one Virginias lead is down to seven plenty of time for Wake Forest Alice splits two count it plus the foul Hunter Salis flying through Applause contact great pass there by Spillers he catches and finishes and Hunter silence reminds everyone while he will be a second year All Conference guard Randolph children Jay alter with with their backs against the wall Here Comes Wake Forest the Virginia 14point lead is down to just five and Hunter Salis a chance to complete this and one and cut it to four plenty of time the deakes have scored 44 points in the paint with his chance at the end when to make it it 45 points plenty of time they dont need to settle continue to attack the paint but again they got to continue string together stopped theyve done a really good job last couple couple minutes here of Defending and getting stops can they continue Wake Forest on an 81 run Virginias lead has shrunk to four Ro trying to back his way in uses the window missed it great job by Frederickson there stand between the ball in the Music Applause basket Salis barking orders going against Saunders leans in and draws the foul a chance to cut this lead to one possession from the free throw line anytime Hunter Silas gets that matchup he waved off the screen he knows he can get to his spots and Elijah Saunders with four fouls BL cannon with four fouls Jacob Kofi with three so Virginia has to deal with all this foul trouble in the final 7even minutes here youre onon Sanchez you just want to get to the under the five minute Mark at that point in time youd feel comfortable with having one of those bigs on the floor and without Anthony Robinson its a depleted front court for Virginia clinging to now a twopoint lead its its a 101 run for Wake Forest fighting for their NCAA tournament lives here at home K needs to get back to moving the basketball Kofi draw the foul and hell go to the line but he is six for eight Applause tonight get to your second and third rotations if youre thats been really effective for you allow you to draw files and get open looks Music and Kofi connects on the first that ends a twominute scoring drought for Music Applause Music Virginia got them both kofs a really good free throw shooter for a big he shoots 80 nice stroke fundamentally sound bright future for this freshman Virginia going fullcourtpr here leading by four with 638 to play this token pressure offering a little Music resistance Salis already with 20 Twan game with Fon Reed going to work against the Freshman Kofi give it back hes got it big got Kofi on he allowed him to switch again you got to identify that going inside and Wake Forest comes up empty Andrew roie took a timeout as he was falling out of bounds heads up play by the junior roie head coach Ron Sanchez loves it hey play they made a change to the rule couple years ago you can do that you can call a timeout I know coach forbs is upset with the call they can he was out of bounds but you are allowed to call timeout when youre falling out of bounds clearly inbounds and the timeout was called Ro could feel that he was off balanced enough that he got the timeout its great timeout you dont want to throw the ball in underneath the opponents ramp you throw that ball in wait gets it they lay it up Burns a timeout Music critical game right now youre trying to get the momentum back your Music way Virginia has knocked down nine threes Wake Forest only two but the Cavaliers dealing with foul trouble five players with three or more fouls Saunders and Buchanan with four and W for us weve said it throughout the night battling for their season right now cant afford a loss I thought last possession blew an opportunity there Frederickson they had to switch and then frerick takes his defender back and it allows a guard to get on Hunter Silas he had Kofi on with four fouls Virginia six minutes away from bursting wakes bubble Isaac mcne delivers Applause again his fourth made three of the night youve got to lock and Trail him and force someone else to beat you just like Hunter Silas you cant allow him to beat you if youre Virginia sales has a step pulls up and hits great job there coming off the staggers hes in attack mode gets to his midrange now they got to string together stops how many times can we say it offense has not been the problem tonight for Wake Forest it has been their defense and Virginia will be patient when theyre in this move of block theyre going to be patient use the screens theyre going theyre big theyre going to set the Music screens theyre theyre not going to turn it over theyre going to get a shot mcney 21 points pulls up got it again Isaac mcne he has taken over the most underrated aspect of his game is his ability to score off the bounce hes an elite shooter but he can mix it up off the bounce he has all the moves that hases the Crossovers and the pullups to make difficult shots ild fading away off balance nothing but air its just not a good shot its not the shot you won and again we talked about it why are you s he forced it there done a great job of getting to the rim continue to attack now you got to guard you got to sit down and guard again chase him off the screen make Forest to cut this Virginia lead to two the Cavaliers have ballooned it back to seven looking for more day day ases got Applause Music it Day Day ases fires Virginia up by Applause nine MCN with the catch in three you know you got to run him off the line but guess what hes got this in his bag also hases he to the mid range Virginia pulling Music away defensively against the NC State team okay chalk it up NC State shot the ball really really well um I know Steve Forbes is scratching his head because this team has just struggled defensively and they have hung their hat defensively and thats been their calling card this is not his best offensive team I think every team that hes coached outside of his first year has been a better offensive team this team is better more physical athletic defensively and its letting them down here tonight Salis loses the ball Andrew Roy has it finds Murray theyll count it as a goal Wake Forest saying you got to review this Trayvon Spillers cant believe it was it in the cylinder or did Spillers cleanly pin this against the glass this will be the best angle thats a good block yeah that ball still going up thats a good block I thought it was a mistake by Virginia could have poured it out milk the clock a little bit thats a really good block this should be quick thats a clean block this should be overturned wake will be lucky with not they be benefit with this call because just a sloppy unforced turnover call on the floor of goal tending has been overturned white ball with 29 seconds on the shot clock so Wake Forest gets the basketball trailing by nine running out of time though 342 to go Rand you were talking about the defense that really got Steve forbess team into position position where they belonged in the NCA tournament well that threepoint field goal percentage best in the ACC has let them down NC State 13 made threes on Saturday Virginia is knocked down 10 toight well what happens to that is that theyre not guarding the basketball and its getting in the paint its forcing them in rotations and teams are hurting them so theres just not much resistance in general I mean Virginia shooting over 50 for the game I mean theyre having their way theyre getting any shot that they want and w Forest only two of 10 from three they have not shot the three all season long its just not a strong suit of this team as Virginia goes to the Applause Zone Frederickson hes the guy who if youre going to get someone going maybe its him he struggled this season to just 22 from three but he had five big threes in the win at SMU was the reason they won that Applause game and he shoots it so well in practice its just a confidence thing now that you know fell in got shots the fall against SMU and he took a quick shot there and Steve Forbes no we wont have we dont have enough time left in this game for empty possessions and cant turn it over and take quick shots hard to believe hes 22 from three on the season under three and A2 minutes to play Wake for is trying to avoid their bubble bursting here at home Salis dumps it down F re tough take Reed does a great job of just holding his seal the guards cant penetrate and turn the corner they know they stop play off two feet they can just drop it off to him a Point Blank Range she shoots it with either hand got to get stops mcne hes had the hot hand hits it again Isaac mcney 25 points tonight just no answer for him just no answer just been too easy all night long got got the ball whatever they Applause wanted clean Music block Virginia a ninepoint lead two and a half minutes to play Virginia you dont want to take this shot till under the 10 second shot clock unless its an easy Music Applause shot Ro shot clock down to four cant connect offensive rebound Murray cleans up the spill when you struggle all year long with something is W Forest has we talked about again rebounding the basketball theyve been out rebounded on the year things like that always rears his head in wrong timeing its a tough time for the de not to clean up the glass there Salis with two coming at the line what a puzzling stretch for Wake Forest these four games you lose at home to Florida State you choke a big lead in that second half and then you go on the road and beat a really good SMU team then lose the NC State and now back at home where you knew you had to handle your business and time is not on their side Steve Forbes frustrated as everybody with Wake Forest is right now number three Notre Dame on the womens side highlights the final Thursday night womens basketball double header of the regular season ACC Network tomorrow night you do not want to miss that ranked double header 10point lead for Virginia under two minutes to play full core pressure from Wake Forest trying to rescue their season well when youre not accustomed to applying full court pressure in only this situations youre just going this is what youre trying to do youre trying to force a still hope that a team gives it to you but right now Virginia has four guards on the floor and Kofi as a big as a good ball handle they use him to press break and thats going to force Fon Reed to be involved in that full court pressure and thats not his strength and these Virginia guards have delivered on the road Ames roie and mcne been outstanding You could argue his performances right up there with the pit performance on the road as the most complete Game Virginias played all season we talk talked about this before at shoo rounds watching these teams and I said this to you this team is playing better and I think its something that in talking to San Co Sanchez hes grown and how things have been for him doing the season Salis throws it down but could it be too little too late a mountain to climb a Herculean comeback necessary for Wake down 10 with a minute 30 to play Virginia breaks the Press looking to kill this clock braon Sanchez like I said they have been the last two and a half weeks this team has been really competitive they had won four of five before losses to Duke in North Carolina ases missfires Wake down to their final bullet a minute to go no time to waste you got to make a quick decision here Applause off the knee of mcney 50 seconds to go W Force has the foul ralis steals it behind the back up and in timeout Steve Forbes one timeout remaining for the Demon Music Deacons great defensive play there by Hunter Silas just being aggressive great job officiating it wasnt a foul got to steal W for us got set there deep were not accustomed to seeing hit 80 in fact this is only the 15th time in an ACC game where Virginia has scored more than 80 points they have played 316 ACC games and this is only the 15th time wow timeout taken by Virginia great job there youre trying to time up you get the Trap where youre wanted in offin Corner forces Virginia to burn a timeout both teams with one Virginia with one timeout remaining Wake Forest is out of timeouts 38 and a half seconds to go still to come our ACC triple header continues out west with SMU taking on cow SMU another one of these bubble teams down the stretch of this season youre coffee and you catch it again you got to turn it face you cant turn your back against the pressure you want to try to get the ball in Isaac mcneels hand what a performance 10 of 14 from the field four of seven from three nearly the inbounder and he left it short stolen away wake the door slightly cracked hildr cant hit the three they come up empty on a golden opportunity a gift on the inbound pass great opportunity there the senior hildr crushed he knows how important this game was to wake season they all do they know whats at stake and you can see the fans there everyone here knows thats his mom there and Hunter silass mom she knows everyones been talking about it all week and again its bad as they feel right now theyve got to find a way to pick themselves up still have a chance but right now you got to go to Cameron and you got to get one its just as simple as that and as we know what theyve been and what theyve shown all year long but its one game one afternoon got to figure out a way to get it done I Bia season High 27 points tonight has delivered a huge blow to the Wake Forest resume Salis his fires from three HTH strong offensive performance 22 points for him tonight they didnt do enough defensively jump ball possession arrow with with wake its a bad mistake
