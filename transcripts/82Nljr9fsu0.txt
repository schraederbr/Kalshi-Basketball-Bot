quick turnaround less than 48 hours later here we go malat enters the circle Jaden Williams in for the Cardinals Duke controls the opening tap underway Cameron manto man defense to Applause start early touch for FL nipple off and running partially rejected inside and a turnover UIW gets it in their first possession bayy Anderson hayon Williams Jordan Pike returns to his native North Carolina threw up in Greensboro he was excited about his return and an early foul goes against seon James dont let the record be deceiving for UI thats the way were going to reference them tonight like it this is a good team they move the ball theyre well coach Shane hman has done an excellent job just getting his group together staying connected and and working on the detail of their own offense first possession for the Cardinals play in the same league as MCN State consider the favorite in that conference inside a block malat stuck in the helps side d and a foul call so what you watch for with Duke is theyre changing in disruptive defense and of course with the perimeter size that John sh has this year you can do some things differently on the defensive end we saw a trap on a side ball screen and when you have a malow watch on the back side of your defense theres a lot of things you can do to press up on teams and make it challenging two fouls on James less than a minute of play Blue Devils also without the services of Malik round tonight hes got a toe injury its not considered long term but coming off 11 rebounds in the win at Louisville something certainly to watch to see how long he could be out of the lineup one of the things you want to do when you go against Duke in here is you want to try to shorten the possession shorten the game shrink the court as much as you can Malo watch the love and the finish duks on the board I mean hes 72 with a 75 Wing spit absolutely incredible Here Comes Jaylen Anderson standing threepoint shooter the midrange is there see malat hands down on that and hes got to have his hands up cuz he can affect the vision not only just alter shots I think hes only scratched the surface of what hes going to be capable of by the end of this season talking to John sh this morning he certainly felt that way the roster so many freshman involved tend to believe thatll be the case and an out for flag his first triple so the 131 is going to allow Corner triples and John shires team spent some time working on this at shoot around today trying to get the ball to the corner to make a play stolen by Foster and Foster was bumped thatll go on jayen Anderson his first he called the corner three like Siberia to this team which I found interesting well he was really concentrated on his team cutting you know changing their Pace cutting hard um when they get to the different splits how you change your pace on that and getting to the corner is important for stretching the defense not that theres anything wrong with s here you just dont think a lot of people live there want to go there not interested in Siberia its cold yeah its way too Applause cold flag box proor now Caleb boster inside tried to spin it around couldnt do it and the rebound grabed by Applause py one of the things John Shys team wants to do early is force UIW to call that first timeout right theyve had to call a couple of timeouts early in the game because they have trailed early open three thats Heyman in and out Pik grabbed the rebound lost it for a minute back outside to Haymon oh for two two on that stretch and the put back by Williams so Jaden Williams active in the early going Jaden Williams a 69 freshman doing a nice job and because UIW has been able to score they can set up this half court 131 and they stay in it for The Possession Corner triple canle connects tied at five more than 3 minutes in con shooting a blistering 52 from Deep at home so far in his freshman campaign Bailey and airball fly clears heres Proctor Applause Baseline this is what they worked on today when they dont have a transition opportunity John Shire calls it new control when theres no advantage and then they run their stuff and look at that wide open canle Off the Mark and the rebound pops out to Foster and a foul in the process this is a great job by Foster to get a piece of the paint and even though that pass was low did you see how canle didnt drop his hands he dropped his body as a shooter you never want your hands to drop below your waist that was an excellent job thats a textbook shooter right there by K thats fundamentals 101 Debbie antelli I love that well thats what Steph Curry does I mean if you watch Steph Curry hes dropping his hips all the time Foster drops it off GBA who just checked in so with no Malik Brown GBA expected to get more playing time hyon another three flag another rebound lost the handle down low there there needs to be a little bit more of a sense of urgency I think right here for Duke like they need to pick up their effort you know this this is the number four team in the country right you dont want to give anybody confidence on Coach K Court hand off to Anderson a step back three on the way and the slow starts have been a bit of an issue at times this year for a variety of different reasons Proctor no flag fresh 20 goes to work inside and too easy at 17 years of age I am just incredibly impressed at his Poise and patience he doesnt Force anything hes an unselfish kid by nature and he has an advantage on the Block and he knows thats his time to score top of the key Robinson now perhaps Cooper learned a lot of those skills for Mom well was Mom Tom Kelly was a really good player at Maine Im sure Dad Ralph wants to take a little credit for it too as he should but were giving all the credit to Kelly tonight little give and go flag outside Caleb Foster and cleared finally by incarnate W that was Applause Bailey 7 to five Duke with the lead still waiting for that under 16 media timeout just underway Cameron indorf Music out of their Motion Set they just switch all that action on the top of the floor does Dukes Applause defense shot clock under five Robinson Hees Applause one con Works had some open looks they havent been able to knock him down 06 from Deep so far to your point Foster spins away from trouble outside to Proctor gets outside to flag hell get it back Proctor left wide open I watched Tyrese Proctor warm up he didnt miss between the slots he did a fantastic job shooting it deep getting himself ready to go I think he has really improved his game and his range outside the ark now you go back to those five threes he hit against Kansas last month shooting percentage climbing an awkward Runner nearly went off the glass for Anderson heres Proctor kind of a delayed Euro contact no whistle and finally out of bounds back to the Cardinals 10 to five two with the Music lead thats a foul that was a foul that was totally Music Hall of Fame presented the 2024 Kirk gouty

second up there in his office John sh spent some great time with us so mutual respect here in camera thank Applause you eight nothing run by two Blue Devils by five Cardinals with possession Debbie anelli Roy Philpot so glad you could join us tonight day before exams a quiet hush around campus today threepointer no good by Robinson Mason Gillis checks in grabs a Applause board Foster the spin and dish that one out of bounds see thats part of malats game that hes going to have to grow right I mean his shot chart is right under the basket so when he gets position in there he needs to be ready with his hands not just the lobs be able to catch it and dunk it well you did the research Mal watch if you look at his offensive skill set in twopoint field goals made this year doesnt put the ball on the floor a lot quite frankly because he doesnt have to but its interesting to look at the shot selection and where he is actually attempting shots does have the one triple outside of that its closely around the rim TJ for Jr from downtown and yes indeed that is the sun of the legend the former player of the year in Texas TJ Ford and this is what were talking about with malat yeah this is a small sample because weve only had nine games but hes made 25 twopoint baskets 16 are pick and roll six are offensive rebound put backs and then drop offs mean somebody makes a play off the bounce to get him the ball one dribble one dribble and 25 twopointers made thank thank you Synergy the lead down to two ladies and gentlemen Tell Me Love Music happy holidays Applause good for thead Music Music poy up here oh yeah always today Duke leading Incarnate Word and for John shy he told us earlier today its games like this that scare him the most and they didnt want to get off to a slow start you look at whats happened against top rank Kansas number two alurn this weekend at Louisville the conference opener not the kind of starts were used to seeing here in Duro not at all I mean I I I think they need to get into him a little bit right here right I mean I want UIW to feel my presence right now on the defensive end I think theyve had some open looks they havent knocked him down but Dukes got to pick it up if you cant get anything in transition its because you cant get a stop on defense youre letting these guys hang around shot clock down to two that did not graze the rim and a shot clock violation so we we talk about situational offense a lot Roy and thats not a really good atto for Duke I didnt believe coach sh when he said that today by the way these games scare him more than any other maybe maybe there was something to that at least a start keep it simple stay connected make sure you communicate your switches make sure you have great ball pressure when you have malow watch out there youve got extra ability to take a step closer to your Defender maybe a little bit up the line a little bit more H in the step back too strong seon James back on the Flo with a two Applause fouls Isaiah Evans gets a touch coming in off the Duke bench one thing I would say about malawat watching him early in live is hes going to do a better job with his hands his hands got to be ready on offense his hands have got to be high on defense seion James bullies his way Applause inside so when you mention the hands too it feels like youre talking about his ability to catch the basketball cleanly in traffic he you know he wasnt ready to catch the pass earlier and then when he rotates to help his hands are almost lateral theyre not up and high like to so be disruptive maybe alter a shot fourth rank Duke by four nearly halfway home in our first half Bailey two to shoot got to go now that was high Hands by marock see he got to shoot it over the stretch Evans the quick trigger and cleared by Williams now Duke starts tonight two of eight from Deep Incarnate Word just one of eight from downtown you see coach hman telling his guys slow it down shrink the game short in the possessions use the clock make Duke guard side to side Shane hman the former Tulsa guard shares the same agent as John Shire a multitude of commonalities led to the match up and for inordinate word its a great opportunity to showcase what youre trying to become on the road at a top five team in the ACC picked seventh in the Southland Conference Gillis that is an offensive foul the shove with the elbow thats going to be his first the other thing that John sh wanted his team to do today was play off two feet Im sure we saw that there dont forget Saturday afternoons ACC Network mens basketball double header old rivals Syracuse Andor square off for the 100th time 230 Eastern then jir Watkins and FSU take on two lane the second game of the Auto Nation Orange Bowl classic down in Sunrise Duke already with six turnovers in this first half leading by four Music Applause Anderson delivers with a midrange no good cleared by Williams no good and blocked at the Applause Music rim and a foul on the Applause penetration free throws coming lmen saali going to the free throw line hes got a couple of older sisters that play in the WNBA satu right now in Dallas nerra is in New York and New York won the championship this year leine salby at the stripe for Incarnate Applause Word du picked up the foul excuse me Debbie thats his sorry Ro Duke expect some pressure here weve seen the 131 half back into the 131 Zone lets see if they uh change it Applause up oh two at the strike the rebound cleared by Jordan Pike Cardinals get it back in between two freshman which wont look good on film tomorrow Anderson high off the glass no ripped away Solly again in a foul call as can nipple hit the deck Shane hman looking on you got to throw it way up off the glass with malawat there that was high and Sab doing a great job of drawing another Music foul TJ for Jun checks out its five team fouls on Duke Now look for Duke right here to maybe trap on this Baseline out of bounds they were working on the situational defense today in shoot around pops out to Williams picked up by James C at word coming off its first conference victory of the season in the Southland Mike got a bit too fancy turns it over heres Proctor wants the three black try to tap it to himself itll stay with Music Duke well the one thing John shy told us today about Cooper flag and you asked him the question virtually everything has been said about The Talented freshman already just nine games in what hasnt been said and he said you know in a game like this he will try to be too selfless he wont try to get his necessarily early he has a habit of building up his teammates first its incredible but we have to remind him at times hey its okay to be aggressive and to be assertive with a shot off the pick and roll a foul flag was bumped inside you know hes 17 years old hes got the weight of the world on his shoulders when it comes to having the celebrity having the attention but hes a grounded kid because his parents are fantastic and they understand that sort of tough love that John sh can provide but also his mom Kelly can provide as well cuz shes a baller and she understands it last fou was on Pik can nipple hey and clears all you want to do when youre 17 is play basketball and have fun with your teammates and thats what the way Cooper flag approaches the game when you watch him play you see the pure joy that the kid plays with it was great today shoot around the back door C Hayman and a one possession game less than eight to go in the half I mean Shane hman has got to be pleased with the Poise that his team has played with they empty out the backside they back cut theres no help he gathered his team at Center Court after shoot around today talked to them about the tradition the history here in this arena is not on lost on this group from San Antonio and a foul call three throws coming when we come back to Cameron twopoint game 732 to go in the half Music where Applause f he Music he Music Music Beck and Cameron and UIW has done an excellent job manipulating the five player which is malow watch right here now watch Hes pulled away from the rim now watch this action right here canle guarding a non shooter freeze it right here he takes his Defender up and he back Cuts look at the space inside malow watch has his hands down this is is just a great play by UIW to back cut Dukes defense the weak side needs to know Personnel so you can have maybe a foot in the paint when youre guarding Sab I wouldnt have two feet out of the paint canibble 94 at the line this season UIW just one of nine from Deep yet trailing by just two and we mentioned the quick turnaround after the road trip to Louisville The Comeback win there less than two Days Later Duke starts the the night shooting just 278 you got hymon going through the back door youve got UIW trying to do everything in its power to be the hangaround team and so far thats exactly what they are I love this for John Shire coming off the timeout you got to Speed the game up so you go fullcourtpr you got to make them feel you on the defensive end hasnt happened yet no it has not and I think UIW is Comfortably running their stuff and when you get back cut it Duke that is not a good thing well said Robinson inside hman triple team and rejected theyre going to count the bucket it was on the way down malat snuck in and the lead down to just two I like speeding up the game right here and I like this effort this is what Im talking about look at malow watch go up and get it I dont know you didnt like it I dont know that that ball was going in or down but it was closed flag silky smooth both his buckets have been back to the basket overpowering his matchup number one player in the ESPN 100 Paul B cardi loved him from the GetGo so does the rest of America his potential unquestioned now look at the pressure Duke is applying on the ball handang I think thats a contested top two and thats the one they make that was one of the best defensive um plays that Duke had I had great pressure on the ball Bailey said thank you very much yeah well bayy has had 41 in a game already this year so that dude can score Blue Devils get it back approaching six to play Bailey second the Southland Conference in scoring and theres a chance for three count it and a dribble second dribble on a main basket right malat gets the ball away from the bucket and then just does a nice job one dribble and then doesnt run over the defender right does an excellent job with his body control and handles the contact second foul on Robinson did you talk to him pregame and tell him no but its literally a drop in the bucket for that guy right I mean literally hes just dropping it in the bucket hey come on youve only had one dribble on all those twopoint makes this year can you give us one more tonight thats what he just did its a big First Step too when the ball hits the deck he he cover a lot of Applause ground Duke switching in there manto man look at that dig by Mal watch thats another tough two Bailey contested midrange heres kipple giant the Alle B watch the Finish and a timeout will be called by Incarnate Word the lead at seven here at Cameron indor Music now come on malow watch we saw him run the floor take the dribble make the shot he has been a little bit everywhere so far tonight I mean this is a rim run straight to the front of the rim canle does a nice job with the leave and he puts it away John sh told us we talk about him on the defensive end but theyre looking to get him the ball more offensively I mean he comes into the game averaging seven points a game I can see a double double out of that guy as this as the conference play begins and maybe more often than not he gets close to those numbers averaging for the season and without Malik Brown tonight hes going to get a few extra minutes at the five and I think Cooper flag might play some five is that the small lineup for two theres no small lineup for two flag of the five feels like its smaller theyre the tallest team in the NCA Florida States the second talls to according to kenpom you and I both saw Florida State last week you saw him against Inc State I had him down bat rou against LSU they are tall rangy they switch everything theres a great trap on the Baseline so mewat doing his job defensively once again three turnovers for Incarnate Word and Malik round with the tow injury not serious not expected to be out long term but not playing tonight you see his numbers up at the Yum Center on Sunday hes a big part of the reason why I think Duke as a team is a right side of the Box cour team I mean assist steals tips deflectors not just points and rebounds its all the other things on the right side of the stat sheet I like the left side the point I know I like that tooo but Im telling you like this group of players has really come together foul inside free throws coming feran officiating crew Tonight Eric Lewis red Hampton Music jeno and the Blue Devil set to shoot a pair as Heyman just picked up the personal malow watch at the strike eight of 10 this season lead at seven and come on the Freshman from South Sudan well get one more dont forget coming up Sunday afternoon ACC Network womens basketball to Triple header Miami pit starters off at noon then number 14 North Carolina top 25 Georgia Tech over at Carmichael and willll finish up the Day loyal McQueen and Clemson taking on Wake Forest the game of the day on Sunday is Georgia Tech North Carolina n forner has her team back in the top 25 theyre undefeated and she has in a league full of great go s she is led by a freshman named Danny cardigan Carnegie excuse me and Tony Morgans one of the best point guards in the league so thats a good game to watch I may have heard you talking with Mark Packer pregame and I may have heard that you think Courtney bangard at North Carolina has one of her best teams since shes been the head coach I think its the best team shes had in six years at North Carolina there we go they they are very good defensively you cant have enough guards Alissa us as one of the top athletes in the league it its its a very well put together schematic defense that plays hard and plays together second foul on canle hell have a seat on John Shys bench lead at eight car at word just won for its last seven Proctor tipped it out of bounds thats a tip deflection youre trying to get I dont know what John shs number is but i Ive heard Rick Patino talk about in getting into the 20s is that the right side of the box score there that to me is the right side of the box score yes the right side of the stat Applause sheet TJ Ford Junior treding to inbound it and a 5sec violation couldnt do it all right so the defensive tenacity has been ratchet it up it feels like these last three minutes well coming off that last timeout when John sh put his team in a full court press and change the pace of the game they sped it up and thats what they needed to do its a good coaching move by coach sh he was great with us today its first time Ive talked with him pregame in an environment like this proor right down Main Street 24 to 14 larest Le Proctor with five I think John shires always great with us you know you get to have a lengthy basketball discussion its about Hoops its not about anything else thats what I love you asked him a question which I found very interesting in regards to preparing for whats to come and seeing teams maybe the postseason that you will not see in the regular season and you ask him the question is that something you guys Scout Way in advance in his response no he said no were worried about the next game the next opponent I said with all your staff youre not breaking down Tennessee or Marquette or Houston or you know teams you might see that you havent already played of course you got the conference so you get that taken care of but I I was curious to know how far in advance I mean like Im Im looking at Tennessee as a final four Contender team I might see down the road theyre number one in the country right now for a good reason com by the rebound fou inside Alabamas another team on my list Im keeping an eye on coacher told us something he used to do a little bit more now not as much Tyrese Proctor gets the job done for number four the layup hes got five and the leap in double figur Music we Music Music Music I Music F got a pair of basketball luminaries back in the building with us tonight please welcome back lucky Waters welcome back ran young back at Cameron the lead at 10 Debbie Antonelli Roy Philpot number four Duke over Incarnate Word out of the Southland Conference Cardinals coming in at five and four Duke and S and two only losses to Kansas and Kentucky in both games one possession in the final minutes and John sh told us today we learned a lot from those two games gam and we learned a lot in facing the two bigs in those two games hunter Dickinson at Kansas Janai broom and alurn that was a win against alurn of course but he said he likes how theyve been able to figure things out after the fact and uh that should vote well when conference play arrives next next month well I think when youve had Mark Williams or Derek Lively on the back row of your defense as a rim protector and shot blocker and I think thats when Duke has had some of their better teams recently all the way back to the landlord blocking shots for Coach K those teams were good does malat have that kind of potential I mean I think he does you do I mean absolutely I mean look at the size of him look how mobile he is you dont see guys at 72 with a 75 wingspan move as easily and as quickly as command does he has a standing reach of 98 Applause in seven turnovers now for Duke lead down to eight were back to the 131 by UIW so they did review the goal tending call during that last Applause timeout and it was a basket Music Applause Music Applause and a foul goes against Foster Davon Bailey back to the line 71 free throw shooter Bailey Nails the front end of the one and one hes got three points lead down to seven dont forget the annual ACC huddle Bowl preview special Friday at 6 Eastern right here on acc Network the ESPN app take an indepth look at all the ACC teams playing in a bowl game plus college football playoff bracket preview with breakdowns and comprehensive analysis and dont forget you got SMU in the dance you got Clemson in the dance Mustangs at Penn State Clemson at Texas in that first round Mor is better when it comes to college football Debbie yeah I Im Im ready to expl expand the playoffs already oh you want to go from 12 to 14 just let everybody in why notor I mean you get 68 in and mens basketball right Gillis and out of bounds Dumba could not Corell it leak down to 6 212 remaining in the half if youre Shing hman and youre holding Duke right now to 24 points with 2 minutes left in the half this is a Duke team that averages nearly 81 points a game and weve seen multiple changing defenses out of Coach hman weve seen the 131 we just saw a 221 back into man weve seen them mix it up and Duke again is going to apply full core pressure which I think is a good coaching move by coach shy Speed the game up speed the pace it doesnt have to be up and down faster it could be quarter Court faster theres a lot of ways you can change the rhythm of a game substitution call timeout but you can with your defense as well Mike trying to split the double team his second turnover seon James wide open pops out to Proctor and another three well the LI remains on this side of the floor 90 seconds to Applause go Cooper flag tries a triple Davon Bailey in Applause control now Bailey can go off weve seen him make a couple of tough shots already Applause and the Cardinals will slow it down the minute remaining great pointer oh net by Anderson and a timeout called a one possession game and John shy has seen up he might give it to him right here because that is poor connectivity on the defensive end and a lack of communication Music yeah threepoint game less than a minute remaining of the first half Debbie anelli Roy Philpot and a surprise score here at Cameron and we saw that last three by Jaylen Anderson I mean watch this defensive effort right here hes worried about the screen seon James and malow watch is in semi drop coverage right there its a great choice by Jaylen Anderson and it forces Duke to take the time out trapping out court pressure malat downstairs connects hes got 10 first half points its a great weapon to have that size around the rim its also a great Applause bailout Cardinals came into this game top five in America in threepoint percentage as a team over 42 been able to hang around so far nine to shoot and one more look at that last l i mean this is just so simple look how spread the floor is James just throws it up near the rim thats almost too easy for your liking isnt it way too easy I mean its I like it okay its easy but but they dont have size at The Rim to be able to deal with that so they should be going to Mal watch more like John sh told us today a shoot around shot clock down to three High arcing three hit the top of the back backboard off the shot clock and out of bounds by Bailey so Duke one more possession with 15 seconds remaining in the half shot clock is off for John shy team and these are the situations in game where I think John shy team is already growing youre going to put the ball in Cooper flags hands youre going to go with about eight on the clock and let him go sometimes he wants a screen sometimes he doesnt FL contested the rejection malat was fouled and come on a chance to add two more to The Ledger its a great Rebound in traffic by malawat what a good first half he has had for Duke you go middle ball screen and let Cooper flag make a choice 10 first half points make it 11 for number Applause nine help lead South Sudan qualify for the Olympics in Paris last Music summer and only scratching the surface with his potential th far in his freshman campaign Ripper hitting came in averaging seven four and a half boards per contest two of two at the line hes got 12 the lead back to seven Haymans got to throw it long and he will and the Blue Devils with their fewest points in a first half this season coming against Incarnate Word keep it close was a one possession game until the final minute of the first half I mean youre youre this close and you shot 26 from the floor right yes so uh I dont know if the paint was falling off the wall in the locker room but that works and that has worked all game 14 on the board and a chance for one more well the foul goes against hayon thats going to be his third just a great leave in theres a transition bucket for you a rim run and a dunk Applause Music on a watch with 15 double more than double this season outage lead back to 10 theres a trap and full court pressure I like it remember Duke is off for a week their next game against George Mason a week from tonight good sh indicating to us theyll get tomorrow off one more day off later this week and all of a sudden Game Time is Back even with exams underway starting tomorrow a little bit of a respit a lot of travel in three Road games before the start of the New Year midrange no and that was Bailey really good possession starting with a Trap full court and they up their Cadence on the defensive end force a late shot clock heres kiple Baseline blocked off by Anderson now the watch Lost handle for a moment and is going to be tied up itll stay with the Cardinals excuse me with do lead of 10 I think its hard for teams this month not conference play starts to conclude canle is going to be banged down hard hell shoot two to maintain that focus it shouldnt be and the reason why I say that is because you only get certain numbers of opportunities to play as we see kiple with a lob and Jordan Pike picking up the foul its a second listen heres what I think this is how I feel about it Roy you know at Duke youre going to play Youre going to play 30 games in the regular season lets say youre going to play three in the ACC tournament you want to play six in the NCAA you cant have a let down theres no downtime you work so hard for opportunities to play all the stuff you do in the summer in the nonconference and leading into pushing tires up the hill backwards and you know all running in the sand you know all the stuff that they do that is painful and hard right to have an opportunity to play you got to come ready theres no excuses it doesnt matter who the opponent is mares lead at 12 3321 stop and pop and Graves the rim Anderson no good youre going to have maybe 40 games to play what mean youre going to get a let down in there oh theres no let down James and a timeout going to be called by UIW now this is the way Duke shows up in their home arena Music spe Music Music Applause CH it up take that Ms uping Music crying e e Music theres up keeping cing Music it is V week at ESPN when we partner with the V Foundation to highlight the urgent need for cancer research this is gamechanging research that helps save lives you can join the fight right now against cancer by visiting vorg donate and remember 100 of that donation goes directly to cancer research I text with Dicky V today cuz I was checking on him to see how he was doing but I I also wanted to see what he wanted us to share tonight on the Duke broadcast and he said he wants to make sure everybody buys a ticket to win a Porsche its a 100 raffle you go to vorg vital raffle and thats where you can spend 100 for the V Foundation Dicky B were thinking about you we hope you are doing well on this evening you know hes dialed in oh hes watching I think hes watching coach were pulling for you man we love you and we miss you were ready for you to come back keep fighting 14point lead UIW out of the Southland threepointer no that was Bailey so this goes from seven to 14 just like that because Duke picks up their effort on the defensive end and you can feel it up here Proctor Cooper flat was shoved Davon Bailey snuck prevent the layup hell pick up the person now this is an example of what John Shire was telling us today about Cooper flag how unselfish he is hes had a couple screen and roll opportunities he had a post up opportunity early on a mismatch he had hes taken one three hes really not been as aggressive as what I think coach sh would like for him to be at times but I think thats the unselfish nature with which he plays he said hes a sponge he absorbs everything but he wants to LIF up others before he gets his and at times theyre going to have to remind him hey its okay to get after and get those points and set the tone for the rest of this team tone is the key word right there cuz at 17 years of age hes the hardest worker in the gym and hes their best player and any coach would think thats a dream to have dont you think that that emerges the deeper we go into this season that hes going to be not necessarily more comfortable but simply understand at a deeper level its got a chance to be not necessarily his team but at times it could be when they need it to be that makes I dont think theres any question I mean weve seen in the games where late game situation shs calling his number as seon James theres a transition bucket for you Roy transition bucket for the twolane transfer and a chance for three not sure how he got that to go but it went hes so strong and he handles like a football player you know like that contact balance thing where you cant knock a guy off his line look at the size of seon James I mean he is hes built for contact 66 225 maybe you could play for Manny Diaz here yeah definitely over Wallace way the rebound cleared by Jaden Williams lead at 16 cter word without a single point to begin the second half it was sevenpoint game at the break Dylan heon picked up the dribble heres TJ Fort Jr three to shoot the crossover and the three and of bounds back to the Blue Applause Devils different game a different feeli to begin the second half right remember the beginning I was saying you know John s got to force them to call an early timeout that never happens second half starts soon as second half starts early timeout for UIW right thats what you want your team to do and then Im sure he mentioned something to them about I dont want them to get the ball across mid court right did he say it like that something like that that may have been a l that was definitely a l it went in bounced out and theyre going to take a look at this Music and John sh will get an explanation BR Hampton right over there quickly well take a look as we hit this next Music break in and out thats two points thats two points Del as are Avail for more inform and to Ines pricing anding option Music Music Music Music after the has to entirely so a lot of times you go to a baseball game and youll claim that youve seen something that youve never seen before thats what that sport Prides itself on Ive never seen this in basketball malow watch dunks the ball it goes through the rim as expected not all the way through the net and then it comes back out and it was not touched by Jaden Williams there was no contact this veteran officiating crew reviewed this sequence just as you see it now and it is not two points for Duke the dunk was missed you explain to me how the ball popped back out of the rim well I dont understand the science of it but the ball has to clear the net and thats why its not two points but that would be malow watchs first Miss of the game and Ive not seen that before did the net whip the ball back out out I thought if it crossed the rim the plane of the rim that that would be too what about when you go into Arenas and they have short Nets cuz theyre fast break Nets versus long Nets theres a difference in the the length of the net right Jaylen Anderson picks up his third foul there is sometimes there is we thought originally that Williams poked it back out but he did not have contact with the basketball as malat dumped it and so again put that on the the case book sending that to Brian KY right now I have never seen that Brian KY runs the officials in the ACC well clearly the rim rattle helped get the basketball back up and out not seen that before but Ill tell you what the way he can rattle the rim there is an extra basket here you might need another backup to the backup I had to take physics twice to pass it in college thats one of the reasons why because that does not make mathematical sense to me maybe three times maybe it was more than twice lead at 18 the free throw by Cooper flag so flag now with six points only two of eight from the floor shot clock down to two cinal without a bucket so far in the second half and a shot clock violation thats really good D deep into the shot clock John sh has to be pleased with the effort here in the first 5 minutes of the second half this has been their best five minutes of basketball tonight Blue Devils will get the week off before George Mason comes to Durham a week from tonight then conference play is underway virtually right after that you get closer to Christmas already one Le game in the books the come back at Louisville what do you make of the Cardinals this year in the ACC under Pat Kelce year one it feels like that theyre vastly improved but injured yeah theres no question as Proctor draws a foul good ball move by Duke you know Cas prior out for the year Corin Johnson out for the year those are issues for depth which Pat Kelce has built his winning culture around incredible effort and energy and really good defensive rotation and discipline and then shooting a lot of Threes so they are significantly better than theyve been remember lville has only won 12 games the last two years I had them in the Bahamas I thought they were outstanding losing case in Prior is a big loss I saw a couple of videos that went viral from some of those games its great to see by the way 3921 off the turnover and the foul was caught on Jaylen Anderson thats his fourth for Applause UIW Kelsey just screams energy yeah well I think he needs a GPS on him in practice Im Im already calling dibs on that story I want to see how far he runs and practice every day perhaps a simple step counter we can see how many steps maybe 20000 steps a session I want the whole GPS like the players oh gotcha I want to see if hes what his load management is in practice how about this defense still UIW has not scored so they got to find a way to get an easy one get downhill get to the free throw line heres a situational offense a sideline out of balance play from 15 floer no Baileys Miss cor out by James so one of the things that Dukes defense has done is sped up you IW and thats what it was designed to do and its forced them late into the shot clock and maybe made a little bit uh uncomfortable offensively where I thought they were very comfortable in the first half seon James right side of the paint and a late whistle Bailey the infraction see James going to shoot to is an interesting roster when you think about the three freshman starting weve discussed and some of the veteran experience that is back and is also is transferred in here to Durham its a nice combination you have to think as we get deeper and closer to conference play it all starts to gel and mesh who knows what the potential of this team is you were talking with M Mark Packer before he came on in accp I mean you said Point Blank its a national championship caliber team this year I dont think theres any question I they put a schedule in front of them that has allowed them to grow make some mistakes early right figure out some situational things late game I mean the Freshman got to grow up in a hurry like theyre talented theyre not as experienced but they got big game experience already in their nonconference which is going to set them up for the ACC and I I wouldnt be sleeping on Clemson and pit I think they are both outstanding basketball teams Clemson beat the same Kentucky team that defeated Duke and theres the first points of the second half for the Cardinals it was Dylan Hyman hes got six Applause Applause I think a lot of people forget Clemson made a run to the elite eight last season PJ Hall is gone Ian shefflin has been impressive so is Caleb Foster for the Blue Devils Ian shefin leads the nation in rebounding right now and he gets 12 a game and he gets four on the offensive end many against Kentucky like 20 yeah 20 extra effort constant energy really good skill set go with all that effort too theyre also high on Pittsburgh and Jeff c a great job hes done there theyve recruited well a lot of nice experience back in the steel city G by the rebound Here Comes Duke I think the ACC is in search of those other teams and whos going to be there by the time we get to March its going to be an offensive foul James picks up his third now coming up Saturday afternoon the ACC Network mens basketball double header how about Syracuse Georgetown squaring off 230 Eastern then jir Watkins Florida State take on two lane the second game of that double header at 430 Eastern the auton nation Orange Bowl classic

d right there on the catch by Dylan hymon pass goes to Evans bumped on the way up free throws coming for number three blue and white watch the D right here by Haymon get two feet in the paint there you see the foul first Williams its one of the things coach shy was working on today with his team you know reading getting into that second level making the right read playing off two feet thats the thing that canle does really well you know he can shoot it and hes got textbook for him but he can controls the ground hes not a high flyer hes a guy that he knows how to make reads he cuts well he cuts hard hes got good space and Rhythm to his Applause game Wisconsin Gatorade player the year last season now end Durham in that pass from Ford sails out of bounds I do want to get your take on Isaiah Evans because we saw him take over the comeback win against alurn the six threes in the first half and I mean it was incredible the shooting display that he put on it Duke remember was down 13 to two right out of the gate and then Isaiah Evans had well hes made 13 threes and two twopoint baskets so thats a scout right now right he did get 10 minutes in the Ral game asle does a great job of setting his feet under his shoulders thats what Im talking about knowing how to cut well finish talking about Isaiah Evans the 66 175 lb freshman now with 10 after this latest three watch kiple do a great job of setting up his defense playing off the Mason Gillis screen and look how solid his footwork is hes got a strong solid face High release eyes on the target elbow under the ball its beautiful back to Evans hes thin hes athletic hes got to earn his minutes in practice right I mean were not in practice every day but what a debut basically I mean in camera to make 63s its a dream come true for anybody who grew up in North Carolina theres an example right there of his what Im talking about in his skill set 29 above 33 field goal attempts from prepoint range an off seon in the wait room will definitely do him some good and gunba trying to bust through appear to be a screen set near the elbow called for the foul P gumba more playing time with Malik Brown out tonight for the blue dos and a 5sec violation second one tonight weve seen for Incarnate Word its like a tail two halves for the Duke defense right I mean theyve allowed only four points here in the second half done a fantastic job being disruptive theyve got shot clock violations theyve been able to get 5sec count and they got an open three for Isaiah Evans really nice job by Caleb Foster to set that up Evans with five Firsts field goal theight from the Freshman getting a piece of the paint is like gravity you know youre pulling people in youre sucking them in a little bit just enough to get some space on the perimeter but TJ for he bounce that one out of bounds but it was last Touch by Duke and perhaps kicked in that direction watch Isaiah Evans right here and hes going to lift as the penetration goes to the middle this is a very welldesigned play theres the 4 cut by gungo it leaves a lot of space for Isaiah Evans to knock down an open three do you have a Tator in your living room at home I have been waiting for a t ster to fall off a truck and land in my living room that was brilliant heres a Applause turnover Foster nudge the shot will not count foul on the floor Music devils in the bonus

Mickey enjoying the second half coach hope youre doing well enjoy his show one serious exemp too do a great job with that Debbie anelli Roy Philpot 543 less than 8 minutes remaining at Cameron Corner three to strong you know I was up in the office today with John Jackson and uh coach Pete his offices across from coach Ks Ive been in coach Ks office before when you come off the elevator up there there are the five national championship trophy sitting there and I I said John how come theyre up here where no one can see him hes like oh we we probably have some replicas around and theres probably some in the locker room and that could be a fulltime job being the person that dust the trophies at Duke its a daily task with a number that you have to keep clean theres a lot oh Im sure Zion Williamsons National player of the year is probably on some shelf somewhere Shane Baders National Defensive Player of the Year award somewhere right Heyman just banked in a three and they had that beautiful Museum in the front of the building too it is gorgeous Mal watch now with 17 highest point total weve seen from him so far John sh told us he thought it could be that kind of night for K on malat and heres a look at the five banners hanging here at Cameron the one thing uh about Coach Ks office because I did have an opportunity to spend some time with him in there um a year ago uh when we did a special feature on Coach K um when he he has his desk and behind his desk theres representation of the five national championships but its not trophies its hugs with him and his players I think its very telling about the kind of relationship building thats required to win at that level and how much you celebrate together once you accomplish something like that I just thought it was kind of cool that there could have been a lot of things behind his desk but there were pictures of hugs with his players relationships yeah its awesome 5833 picked up that last foul a couple of free throws by Foster caret word with just 12 second half points for seven minutes remaining heres Ford again behind the back hell get another chance in a fresh 20 theyll say that first shot didnt graze the rim and so Duke gets it back on the rebound interesting second half tonight Applause good roll Applause Gillis Harris was hit hard and a foul is going to be called came down right at the elbow Darren Harris a freshman the one thing that malow watch does exceptionally well is he screens and then he hard rolls to the front of the rim and when you do that every time cuz hes not a pick and pop guy now but when he rolls like that he creates a lot of space so the the replace when you lift up or the fill behind that drive or that roll creates a lot of opportunities for Duke and its really not Scout B these guys are working on being unpredictable in their rhythm of their offense and what they run and the actions that they want 17 the best weve seen in a Duke uniform so far for Kaman freshman out of South Sudan and a breather certainly something to build upon tonight with what hes brought to the table a size Advantage sure I mean thats an imposing threat at The Rim on both ends of the floor Harris five of 10 now at the line get six of 11 this season and Duke does a great job of bringing him away this is not a back to the basket post up game right everything is cut in space a lot of ball screen and hes a heavy ball screen guun and when he comes up and sets a screen in the middle third and he rolls hard to the rim theres a lot of action that you can play off of Hayman connects with the midrange Dylan Heyman has been active 11 points this evening it was a one possession game late in the first half and then Duke since that point in time is sees control outscoring in corent Word by 19 in the second at 22 Evans thought that maybe he got tapped on the head thats a brilliant flare screen right there and thats knowing Personnel okay everyone knows Isaiah Evans wants to shoot the three so you set the flare for him so he can get a wide open look and hes already seing a big basket here in the second half 11 points three triples all those coming in the second half Anderson putting on a dribbling Clinic outside Hyman an airball and heres James gun by inside the dunck first points of the night remember you said no transition points in the first half Chang thats changed hasnt it yes its its a great job of running to the corners keeping it simple keeping the floor spread but running with a purpose John sh referred to the corners as Siberia before this game perhaps its more like the Bahamas tonight maybe thats a stretch and Bou the shotll go on SE James so Isaiah Evans is having a a great game right here here he is with the ball right now hes going to move it okay now watch the action now free it right here heres the screen and hes getting behind that screen for a flare its a really good pass by Gillis almost like a timing play Gillis putting it on the money and allowing Isaiah Evans to step into Applause it three for five from the threepoint line free sub on the line with another Miss free throw Applause Anderson 73 at the line this season in one of two the grown from the student section free food has to wait free food in college is there anything better than that ever free pizza fre food number four to Applause play exactly thats not over coaching it that is running the same set and I dont think John Shire is calling that I think the guys on the floor recognize that they can get that and John sh doesnt want to call every set mention that to us today several times Evans 14 in the second half the runner by Anderson find number three where is he Spencer hubard getting set to check in for the first time this season open look for Anderson hes got five in the last two possessions for the Cardinals Shane hman is going to go back and watch this film and hes going to be really proud of the effort as guys gave in the first half even though they didnt shoot it well but definitely solutions to some of their issues and matching up against the best here of Duke Darren Harris from downtown and a timeout called by John shot Isaiah Evans the hot hand 14 coming in the second half just a great flare screen Evans steps into it and then backto back plays exactly the same set backto back buckets for Music Evans e Music Music thats

some of the little used reserves make their way on the floor the old Double Nickel number 55 Mr Hub yes I love it he was a scout team guy then a walk on now hes on scholarship and hes at the top of the Duke defense he was giving the first team a good look today shoot around looks like Duke showing some zone right here for first possession of the game three no by Haymon and cleared by gunba Here
