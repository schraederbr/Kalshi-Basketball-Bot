ready to jump it and we set sail with the Crusaders winning the opening tip goes immediately into the hands of Tyler Boston talented young freshman point guard yeah speaking of newcoms hes made a big difference in this Holy Cross basketball team and just a freshman youre going to find out there are newcomers on both sides we can introduce you to couple of very young basketball teams coming into their own early in the season big turnaround and the first bucket going to belong to the Crusaders Caleb Kenny he may sound familiar a Richmond native gets it started for the visitors Douglas Freeman High School defensive player of the year but he can score the basketball too the trio of mcne Saunders and Buchanan the consistency in the lineup every game so far in this the seventh for UVA yeah and mcne has been extremely consistent and improved in just about every area defensively a little more aggressive offensively and hes had handle the basketball a little bit more than he had to with beakman at his side he takes the first look for UVA cant get it to go down heres a three that is just disrupted and its eventually going to be carried out of there by Rashard speaking of new faces for Holy Cross here is the group surrounding the youngster Boston yeah anchored by Caleb Kenny who blocked that shot and whos the best shot Blocker in The Patriot League well think about Kenny already making his mark on both ends of the floor to this point its in his his hands one more time you know being 45 minutes down the road from his hometown that he really wants to play well here probably has some family second Team all Patriot League performer certainly will Factor heavily in this afternoon first off the bench for Virginia no surprise here either Jacob Kofi into the game yeah he has really been effective since the very first game where he went for 16 against Campbell in the opener well they go right after the Freshman out of Seattle but he contests it and you would hope if youre a Cavaliers fan to hear a whole lot of that horn today right the violation hands it over to UVA one of the few places in America that celebrates that and and uh and they do it with full knowledge of that was a great possession expect single digits on the shot clock if things are going well for the home team Ro nice no luck and Saunders will knock home the First Virginia points who are on the board like it when Saunders attacks The Rim Yeah we know he can shoot that three point Ball but when he gets to the rim hes going to get to the free throw line more and more which is something this whole team would like to do anden he on the Music Baseline couldnt create separation Boston with a head of steam hes just short off the front of the iron kopy did a good job of sitting on that left hand of Kenny not letting him go in that direction went gathered up nicely by Saunders that time to save The Possession for Music UVA Ro weaving through traffic its eventually off and into the grasp of Rashard Virginia way out top to close off the passing Lanes finally able to get it to nen who fires away from downtown but its back of the iron well two two start as Music the interim head coach of the Virginia Cavaliers looks on Ron Sanchez now at the helm one of the big stories in college basketball this year yeah and had a great conversation with him prior to the game again and very philosophical in his approach to the game well and very similar he comes right out of that Tony Bennett stable and little will change we just talked about the Unique Style with which Virginia plays he is looking for continuity just looking to get this young team established as well that was everywhere but down and the rebound away to Tyler Boston T Murray got all the way to the rim but gosh he had McNeely scanning wide open to top of the key pocket picked here is Day Day AES he will go the distance and lay at home for U really nice the Kansas State transfer is getting more and more comfortable playing point guard for the University of Virginia is is a different skill set if you will and he is beginning to understand what coach Sanchez and the staff want from him he has started each of the last five at the point guard position for Applause UVA and a traveling call going to send it the other way well a good friend thats Rod Sanchez statement about the guy on the other bench Dave Paulson told us a story well share before the day is done about just how far the these two go back but both of them were energized by the fact that they get to go headtohead here today yeah and great respect for each other second season in that location of course talking about Wester Massachusetts however he is a patriot League guy through and through it did a great job at Bucknell well just six on the board between these two thus far coach yeah and a big one an easy one day day a with the defensive play numbers in transition and he said I got this all the way to the Music rim coach Sanchez and Company with five and double figures you can see a difference in the win column the Lost column so far for this UVA Squad ma no question and uh there are some things that are very similar but uh Virginia is shooting the basketball from three uh especially when they win and theyre not turning the ball over getting more opportunities on the offensive end thats a big key only eight turnovers against Manhattan earlier in the week after double digits in those contests we talked about on the trip to the Bahamas the five in double figures for his team McNeely of course who led the way it was Ro Buchanan Ames Kofi who you just saw knock down that opportunity from the charity strike ases double figures for each of those five for UVA in that Manhattan Victory Holy Cross had the first bucket in this one now trailing Virginia by four shot clock down to just a couple going to take a quick trigger for Boston just gets it off and enough of the iron to reset offensive board and the second chance Point works out for Joe nen yeah a good offensive rebounder his specialty is threepoint shooting from long range but hes a big strong post guy too who can step out as that stretch four and hes a commonwealth kid that Commonwealth the Commonwealth of Massachusetts hes a Berkeley Mass native who is in his sophomore campaign home state product how about this work down the lane for Ames somehow kept his balance and laid it Applause in corner three that rattles out Saunders is there to clean it up Aiden Rashard just a freshman again really good perimeter Defender but very confident in his threepoint Applause Applause Music ability contact as McNeely tried to drop Drive Day Day AES the Kate transfer hey he came from the other Manhattan yeah and anytime you can get into the lane thats good offense whether you can finish or kick it out Day Day Ames twice has gotten to the rim in this game sopore a native of Chicago Illinois he was one of the the highest regarded recruits for Kate hes averaging eight per contest in right around 28 minutes a game thus far in the Virginia stage of his career yanan decided to work to close proximity it was not to be and here comes Holy Cross in transition Holy Cross team that averages 729 per game to this juncture but this the highlight of the Holy Cross schedule from get the Tests standpoint before this young team tries to make its Mark in the p Patriot League MC Neely driving wideopen look from up top and Ros going to knock it home Ros been a point guard for this team hes also come in as a wing player but I really like the fact that he can initiate the offense or play without the ball like he did right there well 47 from Beyond The Arc he was just 26 in that department last year his game continues to improve who certainly the perimeter shooting and he has been the compliment to Isaac Applause mcney three on the other end for Holy Cross somehow able to knock this down is Max Green and I know youre very impressed with what Max Green brings to the table he is unafraid of anything thinks he can score every single time from all three levels the leading score in the state of Kentucky last year in high school just connected on his 15th threepoint basket the lrange native who averages 126 per contest he plays right around 30 minutes for Holy Cross per game down to two on the shot clock McNeely fires away and we get a whistle underneath by the way havent introduced you yet to our officials Ted Valentine John Gaffney and Joe Switzer handling things the day after Thanksgiving good looking crew out there K Valentine started in the old Southern Conference back when I was at Chattanooga so weve known each other a long time Caleb Kenny Subs back into the contest khil Singleton joins him off the Holy Cross bench M Ney some separation when he gets that kind of Separation this is generally the result 19 threes on the year hes shooting well over 50 from Beyond The Arc doesnt need much room but if you give him that much room hes deadly Boston lost the handle may have had a little help as Ro was there to disrupt goes behind the back and resets out top just above the Sabers on the Virginia logo talked about Ro directing the offense which hes doing now with aims on the bench 27 starts last year for the Milwaukee Wisconsin native now in his Junior campaign roie mcney zip pass roie one of his own and its a wide open look from the corner whos cant connect McNeely chases it down started all over again Second Chances theyll hurt you like right here pck just a little bit off the mark to the left and holy cross looking for a quick bucket on the other end Boston goes through the three will be taken by Singleton but it too is Off the Mark Virginia by a touchdown early a lot of football this weekend right 147 the score you think about it Commonwealth clashes coming up so many other things itll be a bunch of 14 to SS coming up in the next 48 hours gra your attention youre R around the country and Virginias lead will grow how about the work in the interior theres Buchanan making his presence known the soft more yeah and he hes continuing to get better and better hes got all the skills did a lot of growing up as a freshman a year ago at 611 he is the tallest player on the Virginia roster and he had 11 in that most recent contest the Manhattan win but it so often comes down to the play of Isaac mcney hes been good so far what do you think of Isaac mcne when you hear that name threepoint shooting a lot of transfers three freshman for Dave Paulson are making big contributions already you see Max Green right there Tyler Boston and Aiden Rashard in the starting lineup from Texas Maryland and Kentucky and that Mark in points per contest for green as we said Leading The Way Boston gets so many of the headlines because lets face it as he goes to the line here hes a point guard giving the keys to the vehicle right at the start of his career a freshman Field General for Holy Cross no less and he wasnt given the keys he took those keys hes a DMV product uh out of the state of Maryland he averages right at 10 per contest cant get this free throw to go down great school the bullish school and the rebound away to UVA about the start for Virginia so far ma really solid I like the fact that theyve been able to get inside balance off some of that threepoint shooting they day aims a couple of key drives already and heres a three that wont fall for Elijah Saunders theyve been very good on the defensive end too a difficult offense to defend you see the open middle right there puts a lot of pressure on the defense youve got to really communicate if youre Virginia DeAndre Williams into the contest sees this Rim off hes an Empire State product sophomore who works his way into some playing time in this first half another freshman in for Virginia and isan farmer Sean charma well another three goes down you threepoint shooting something we were both keeping an eye on coming into this one coach because Virginia has shot very differently from Beyond The Arc in the winds versus the losses yeah but but overall still right at 40 which is good and Holy Cross is very good from out there too over 38 keep an eye on what happens from Beyond The Arc in this one on Q heres a three ball taken that will not fall for Khalil Singleton now Virginia up to three for nine while Holy Cross is sitting there at 1 for six so far Cavaliers shooting right at 40 from Beyond The Arc so far on the year but you like you mentioned it 44 in those Applause wins heres ases great a little separation of his own and now kicks it off to Sharma you referenced Sharma into the contest he kicks this and just the head of the horn there is a three ball that goes down its from Andrew Roy the junr and it forces a out on the floor the Baseline drift is really good way to get a threepoint shot and T us to break with a whos surging out front Music Music there a former head coach of the Virginia Cavaliers helped put this program on a national scale from a national championship standpoint winning his coach in the history of the program and boy you think about it it became the story just over a couple of weeks before the season started he stepped away for the next phase of his life and career expect him to be heavily involved here at UVA for a long time to come though yeah and his fingerprints are all over this place and will be all over this place the impact that he has made during his time here uh is immeasurable 15 seasons of course the 19 national championships we referenced 364 wins I mean the list goes on and on the eight ACC titles two turny six regular season and he was a fourtime ACC coach of the year and you hear Ron Sanchez talk who really considers himself to be a part of the Bennett family as long as they were together at multiple stops and the commitment to the Five Pillars is strong as ever it is really going to be continuity with Ron Sanchez at the helm theres no separation into thinking of these two guys approach the same still defense driven just trying to figure out right now how to get a young team to come into their own okay Kenny for all the talk about youth today is the veteran on the floor for Holy Cross and the senior from Richmond drops one home got a shot blocked by kofy the last time this time he went a little further away fell away and knocked it down from about 8 feet preseason Defensive Player of the Year watch for him on that end of the floor but he can provide some scoring as well as you saw Kenny second Team all Patriot League out of Douglas Freeman in Richmond think about the impressive numbers in his prep career and how it is translated they talk about how he has embraced the leadership role on this squad and you have to with so many freshmen and sophomores surrounding him in the Holy Cross starting lineup yeah and hes just the guy to do it defensive player of the year but hes an offensive threat too an undersized post guy who can guard any player on this team dont miss what roie just did with the basketball to keep his balance and keep Virginia in position to finish The Possession Ames takes care of that piece and Ames is so good late in the shot clock cuz he can beat his man off the dribble almost on Applause Music demand back in Kennys hands and hell kick it nent cant connect yeah over a 42 threepoint shooter but hadnt hadnt gotten that range down yet here in Applause Music jpj down left side of the lane it goes in sharmas hands now heres Saunders weave through nicely everything but the Finish was there yeah I love the shot faking drive though you got to close out on him because hes such a threepoint threat so thats going to give him that opportunity not sure Rashard was expecting to pass that ball but it served the purpose and is laid in the bucket by Max Green yeah we told you three levels hes a threat at all three midrange getting to the rim and we we saw him knock down to three earlier green leading Holy Cross to the charge with five well heres one more look at the intangibles provided by Andrew roie coach he saves it and then late in the shot clock little ball screen action Music Virginia did in the portal yeah for for Coach Sanchez Saunders Ames and power have all been in the starting lineup at different times Saunders and Ames averaging right at nine points a game helping this offense well you take a look at Power there as well remember he came over from Duke but Power has the connections to todays contest in that hes a guy who was right in the shadow of Holy Cross when you talk about the prep career yeah and hes a really talented young man still still learning the play because hes been hurt so much that he just hadnt had a lot of time on the floor the more time he gets out there the better hell be Virginia with the basketball having opened up a sizable Advantage here as a names one of those transfers the K State transfer takes it you know you drew attention to the fact that Sharma came into the contest a moment ago alongside those transfers one of the Freshman Virginia has high expectations for and hell kick it to Ames who provides the three ball yeah already nine points thats right out of his average but yeah you mentioned Sharma really a talented shooter just adjusting to the game and he he is a guy that could make a big impact for this team going into League Play fresh crossing over from Canada working his way to Charlottesville you know you talk about the the transfers for Virginia Holy Cross with Four Freshmen brought in alongside just a couple of transfers and you look at these two institutions and and what they stand for who they are academically not always easy to reload in the portal if youre Virginia or Holy Cross no thats what coach Paulson said its just really hard they dont have a grad school so theyre not going to get grad transfers and then their academic standards are really really difficult and you know what the case is here in Charlottesville when it comes to making sure you bring someone over from another location so impact transfers to say the least though they may at times be limited in number here is a chance from the stripe Kenny back into the contest as you kenon lingers around and they called that one on the floor they actually did its going to be an inbound from underneath well all the personnels there whistled back into action Dane Murray seeing some time works this to McNeely and hell go to the line after all for an an one yeah we weve all gotten used to him shooting a three shooting like in the mid50s but getting to the free throw line is something hes added to his game again coming off an 18point performance the last time out think about how consistently he finds his name at top the stat sheet for UVA who was held quiet for game and a half or so down there in the Bahamas but gets a threepoint play here who can forget the fourpoint play that he put together right at the end of the half that contest after the 900 mile Journey kind of jump started him he ended up in double figures there and Then followed it up with 18 leading his team to a victory against Manhattan in the return to Central Virginia Neely so far in this one with six he and roie on the floor the two with that total right now and thats going to be a traveling violation to send it to the other end thats that veteran officiating right there with Ted valid could have called the push off and instead opted for the travel both were correct Applause talk about veterans on a day when theres so much discussion of Youth you have that in the third team on the floor as well smothered out top by Rashard heres the handoff to mcney hell fire away that wont go but it was touched by green and will remain on this end with UVA its very seldom you get a freshman thats that good defensively but Aiden Rashard everybody that I talked to said he is our best perimeter Defender period Rashard who came from The Lone Star State hes a San Antonio Texas native averages right at seven per contest charged with Garden mcney Roy to work on him here and thats going to end up in the Holy Cross bench here itll belong to the Crusaders a little miscommunication had a back cut on the wing and Ro threw it to where the cutter actually was Ron Sanchez talking about how they are simply focused right now on making sure they can hone in on exactly who he expects his team to be he said you know you look at the opponent on the other side while theres a tremendous amount of respect its as much about making sure we come into our own identity yeah and taking care of the basketball is one of their big priorities and not allowing second shots is another one and of course right there we see a little bit of example of that his team battle tested and getting set to be but right now taking care of things in the first half against Holy Cross out of the Music Patriot yeah eight assists on eight assists on 11 field goals is the ratio that Ron Sanchez was looking for you see a lot of different ways to get it done three dribble penetration a lot of different people contribued but the frontman Sharma with three of those eight assists and when he was talking about this team coming into its own embracing its own identity one of the first things out of his mouth sharing the basketball obviously the defensive approach is part of it and thats foundational but the way this team selfishly selflessly shares the basketball goes a long way to its success you see that in recent years Virginia basketball is about sharing the basketball on that offensive end we know about the defense but sharing the ball was just as big a part of the Tony Bennett Legacy yeah if you followed this program for any length of time you know its built on Five Pillars humility passion Unity servanthood sharing the basketball a big part of that piece and of course Thanksgiving which we all celebrated yesterday Virginia off to a strong start here but an answer out of the stoppage for Max Green he can shoot the lights out when he has that kind of space little one onone he backed mcne off and knocked down to Applause three speaking of McNeely pass it up top itll be Saunders taking the shot nothing but purple jerseys in the interior Holy Cross comes away with it just over three to go in the opening half Holy Cross is struggled on this offensive end but its been because of really solid defense by Virginia theres Kofi sitting on that left hand and Kenny had nowhere to go Kofi eating up the space in the lane and all of a sudden single digits on the shot clock wont matter here is this is going to go the other way after all he Palms up for Max Green he wants some type of explanation of exactly what happened there yeah and and I think theyre probably going to look at this because there may have been contact above the neck and shoulders as he created some space didnt look like a deliberate kind of move but it was uh little painful for Mr mcneel yeah both teams sent to their respective benches as they give this another look just trying to create space made a little contact there I dont know if Max Green I sure he felt that because he did it with the tip of his elbow its just a regular foul offensive foul nothing flagrant well the explanation being given to both head coaches a second personal on the offensive foul and the inbound coming as McNeely is there awaiting Music clearance that looks like a a bit of tending to for the Virginia Jr before play can resume got to get that blood stopped its a tender area up there Cavaliers leader out of the state of West Virginia hes not six points with a couple of fi goals you know as as much as he loves to play and as hard as he plays he does not want to come out of this game well and hes going to stay right there he has uh an oldfashioned three as well as one from Beyond The Arc to make up his total in this first half oh Kofi had his man buried but he couldnt get the ball got to have an oldfashioned three with those retro Unis in effect today love this is back to the Terry Holland era right here you look up into RFS and you think about the great history of this program a reminder of it its going to be an offensive call on this end of the floor now as Virginia was down to five on the shot clock and trying to work with some urgency here little push off created space sometimes being bigger and stronger is a disadvantage when the official can see it that clearly yeah I imagine Ralph Samson wore that uniform yeah you take a look up into the rafters 50 hanging prominently not to that history on this holiday weekend happy to have you with us on the ACC Network Virginia surging ahead really from the opening stanza of this one though Max Green has continued to try to fire away and close the gap as much as possible hes been a tremendous perimeter shooter for Holy Cross yeah now you see why coach Paulson left him in the game with two fouls right yeah hes got 11 on the board in addition as you said to those couple of fouls Andrew roie answers on the other end he said here you go freshman post you up 95 seconds remaining in the half boy nice pass to the interior to get it into Kennys hands and hell work it up from the paint thats one thing coach Paulson talked to you about he said how effective will they be able to be getting it into the paint today its been a little difficult just for Virginia Defense makes it such it really does and when theyve gotten it in there the shots have been so contested that they havent had a lot of success of course you know the Virginia Defense top six in division one in scoring defense every year since the 201122 campaign six times they led the country in that category and when theyre patient on the offensive end as well and the outcome is what you just witnessed you see the separation were witnessing with less than a minute to play in the half so calm as the clock is running down look like theyve been there before what a slice through the lane and able to lay it in yeah bad communication that time Ro and Kofi got tangled up and the beneficiary was Caleb Kenny Caleb Kenny has eight hes on the doorstep of double figures with a four of six start to the contest from the field shot clock off for Virginia Music Applause Ney Zips it to Saunders and hell attempt to deliver a three a little too strong and at the horn the first half score set in stone at 3421 you part as we said of a good closing stanza to his time there returned here and with the departure of Tony Bennett from the bench for UVA now embracing the interim rooll as the head coach of the cavali and boy its uh something youll Embrace when you see the way this guy shoots for you and mcne has been the headliner All Season he sets the tone for the second half Embrace his shooting and embrace the patience that it took to get him that wide Applause open Holy Cross first half performance how do you break it down and grade it to this point well they just struggled offensively and and theres some of what theyve got to do theyve got to attack inside even when the shots are contested or blocked theyve still got to attack the rim they left the middle open their only real success was they they did knock down a few threes Canon comes away with a block there he had a team High nine of them coming in to today Kennon picking up his latest Scramble for it on the floor and able to roll that to his teammate was Boston to save possession for Holy Cross little stop turnaround and pop for Max Green the footwork true for the leading scorer on the Holy Cross side he it at the break he had 11 give him 13 with his first bucket of the second half really good at creating just enough space to get the ball off lob pass down near the Baseline Saunders saved it in but couldnt connect underneath the bucket yeah s the rough night shooting three two for eight so far this evening and had a lot of good looks Saunders alongside mcney who we were talking about a moment ago and Buchanan who just had the block theyve been the three stable starters in the lineup for Coach Sanchez all seven games now for UVA its been that Trio providing the stability Day Day Ames has been the headliner so far in this one and itll go back his Direction here hell drive the Baseline and a well theres a snapshot of how dialed in he has been on this Friday yeah its nice to run off offense but its good to create your own sometimes too think about it eight points per contest for Ames when you look at his season thus far and hes already in double figures here in the battle with Holy Cross and again I think thats more Comfort level I think hes a double figure scorer going forward good job by Kenny fighting Saunders for that rebound yeah the senior out of Richmond saving the possession there down the lane he comes with a head of steam just couldnt Elevate enough and he is down going to need a hand up from Joe Nan as he is pulled off the deck day day ases gets by his man recognizes the help adjusts a shot thats why hes in double figures what the point guard has done the Chicago Illinois native talked about that starting group in the trio and hes not in it but he has started every game since that first one at the point guard position for Virginia after coming over from K State mcne Saunders he does elevate and is able to lay it in nice body control well those close proximity shots they mean a lot when what you were talking about earlier had been the case for Saunders thus far yeah yeah it hadnt been getting them to go down but take it to the rim again and speaking of taking it to the rim Max Green what an impressive freshman well speaking of finding a way to make sure you drain him green has had no trouble with that today he is six of nine and that includes four of six from Beyond The Applause Arc Max Green he was the standout player and the Commonwealth of Kentucky and he has traded buckets at times with Day Day Ames who has the Virginia answer he certainly did and he did the same thing little drop step now theyre guarding each other Boston kicks theres a three from the corner Jaden Pharaoh thought hed try that Applause spot and it is not the same result but Day Day aims his spark Virginia here at home backs the man off and elevates for the Music three e e e e e Music family always so much of the focus on Thanksgiving weekend in Virginias senior guard Bryce Walker with a strong family connection to this Holy Cross program makes for a little extra conversation around the Thanksgiving table his dad Bill Walker a Hall of Fame player for Holy Cross yeah I cant imagine the discussion that took place and of course Bill Walker still heavily involved in both programs well they have a mentoring program at Holy Cross with some of the standouts from Years Gone by and he is one of the mentors for The Talented freshman floor General Tyler Boston still giving back to the game that has given him so much of course he played professionally now gets on the same floor in the same building to watch his son and those who remained under his toage the Holy Cross Hall of Famer but the the blood is thicker than water though he still got that Virginia over on though now you know where the allegiances LIE when you talk about blood it uh certainly is a great story and therell be much conversation no doubt for years to come for that family and this first ever meeting by the way so nice that it happens in this time frame well Rising above theres Kofi you talk young players heres one making his Mark yeah and a beautiful assist by tan Murray allowed him to get that easy basket course the Gatorade state Player of the Year out of the state of Washington continuing to introduce himself to Cavaliers faithful nice height think about him at 610 guy who has played starter minutes for Virginia coach even though hes done all of his work off the bench for Virginia thus far yeah and starter numers to almost nine points and seven rebounds a game its had a double double already seven blocks Lucky Sevens in blocks in assists also in Stills so a little bit of everything what do they always call it the the Swiss army knife approach for Kofi and this is a solid possession and an answer for Holy Cross on the other end Max Green shows that he can help other people score too 17 assists on the season second on the team for Coach Paulson second to nobody on this Friday inside jpj he leads all scores with 16 of them on the Holy Cross side of things interior pass single digits on the shot clock Saunders a little too strong yeah n at that time did a good job of just bodying up Walling up in there three Off the Mark substitutions including Ro standing by for UVA at the scorer table well gives us a chance with the stoppage to remind you that tomorrows rivalry weekend college football matchups you dont want to miss them right here on the ACC Network in the ESPN app Duke takes on Wake thats noon Eastern then its state Carolina wolf pack and tar Hills in Chapel Hill and at 8 Eastern well itll be the 106th meeting between the Virginia Cavaliers the Virginia Tech hokes the Commonwealth clash and prime time tomorrow night all of that for you on the ACC Network that one grabbed some attention here in the Commonwealth right n a lot at stake for both schools yeah Bowl eligibility is on the line between the hoos and the hokes tomorrow night in blackburg dont want to miss that one or any of those games on the ACC Network tomorrow boy around the world to get there but a true finish for Pharaoh havent talked a lot about the junior out of the state of Utah just yet but Jaden Pharaoh locked some key minutes for yeah kind of splits time at the post with Kenny so he doesnt get out there a lot but hes a really solid player averaging six and seven rebounds yeah pulls down over 50 boards coming into this one team High Mark in that category kicked back to green when in doubt send it his Direction its a good choice nent puts it on the floor a little turnaround in the interior and he worked himself close enough to provide a solid finish and nen hadnt been able to get get it from Long Range like hes 0 for three but he went ahead and took it to the Grim and had a nice little jump hook yeah KN one as much for what he does on the perimeter as anything else but a bucket for nent in the interior Holy Cross tries to close it up second Music half CCs future success creating a lot of matchups and a lot lot of different sports that we wouldnt have seen otherwise yeah going to be a lot of fun to see how things shake out in this new ACC basketball season you look to say the least down the right side and Buchanan was able to get up there but theyre going to call him pretending this is going to be a bucket for Holy Cross Virginia stayed between their man of the basket until the very end there when McNeely got beat Buchanan tried to erase the Applause mistake tday a brings it up the floor Neely off a screen and he now has the ball up on the wing Ro looks for Buchanan and hes right where he wanted him to be Buchanon with the slam broy 11 points three assists really play him well well and Virginia team that if youre finding us a little later in this one has shared the basketball very nicely today yeah 16 assists on 20 field goals Id say thats pretty good step in the direction youll need as you dial in on that schedule that is going to provide the challenges moving forward for UVA heres khil Singleton from distance the Vancouver Washington Native the sophomore with a basket we talked so much about the Freshman pretty good crop of sophomores for Holy Cross as well yeah really nice he shooting over 45 from Applause three there eight of those coming in today and how about Buchanan starting to heat up he had the slam and now gets the N1 opportunity to follow it yeah and thats the growth he would not have made this shot a year ago the sophomore out of Idaho here on the feed and now with a chance to go to the charity stri for one more both really nice assist on both plays you can and taking the contact playing through that contact with the finish and going to the free throw line which we have not had a lot of those tonight well and hes connected on eight of these nearly 20 tries to this point on the year so looking to dial that in just a bit it rattles out on it once more and Holy Cross will have it as he couldnt quite complete the threepoint play he hes got to get better from the free throw line if you cant be on the on the floor at the end of games and they need him on the floor at the end of games but hes got to get better from the free throw strike and as you said one of the Staples in this Virginia starting lineup in this is sophomore season this team still very much you know you think about the the the national expectations that surround their Virginia program but this is a team a young team its own right with even those who bring experience to the table coming in from other places and learning the system coach yeah and a lot of new faces and and even the old faces in different roles but picked in the ACC and it has been true historically as you get the foul call on the floor here going to be on Buchanan on this end as well just a second personal on Buchanan however heres a look at the sequence and theres the bump just going to say this is a Virginia team that can take a little longer because theres such complexity to what it is they try to do but the wayy Virginia plays and its going to be argued another look may be required here get back to that thought as our officials talk it over just in front of the Holy Cross bench it looks as if the ultimate call will be Crusaders basketball fans inside jpj had different thoughts about that dont they always but to the point we were making they have different thoughts well about basketball in general this is a team that plays a different style and while it takes a little longer perhaps to warm up to it and weve seen that year after year it can pay dividends when it is executed well yeah and and you were talking earlier about the fact they were picked fifth in the ACC and consistently they outperform predictions well and thought one of the quotes that Ron Sanchez had kind of puts in perspective the way the preseason win and the entry into the season he said its almost as if you know this basketball team has to be reintroduced under his leadership and with so many of the new players coming in and know those opportunities theyre on the horizon Florida and then in early ACC play will give them a chance to do that safe to say they have come home in these two games after the trip to the Bahamas and taken care of what was in front of them T Murray some valuable minutes as he dumps this off to Ames just one on the shot clock as he puts it up does make with the iron but rebound to Holy Cross Joe nent standing by to sub in at next

matchups coming up Bo a major contest we talked about it here in the Commonwealth that its for Bowl eligibility but they playoff seating on the line in a consequential weekend of sports always the case when the turkeys on the table this is a three from the corner that wont go and its gathered up by Saunders its a good possession but uh Holy Cross even when they get an open shot they havent been able to really make them at any consistent rate shooting near 35 on the Game mcne Boy the way he negotiates traffic impressive Saunders putb wouldnt fall either in Virginia with a fruitless possession that looks so promising chers comes all the way out to guard Boston trying to direct traffic a little bit and hes going to be fouled as the zeros Collide Timeout on the floor well take it as well mid second half between UVA and Holy Music Cross not even close the mcarthy family dressing balls with gravy there you go well there so much of it that that ties together its hard to separate the entirety of the mill and yours yeah like I said its hard to separate the entirety of the mill a out top for Virginia I was going to pin you down he has been true today 14 points for a he leads off Virginia scorers and McNeely down the lane Waits and that patience will earn him a trip to the free throw line weve talked about this a couple times in the game but 18 assists on 22 field goals that is just outstanding wanting to play better defense wanting to share the basketball a little better those were the conversations for Ron Sanchez so far so good in those departments and the 75 free throw shooter Isaac McNeely to the line well there it is you know its coming every time we say it lets just step away and do something else well talk football tomorrows rivalry weekend available to you on the ACC Network and the ESPN app Duke can wake at noon and of course at Carolina and state contest in Chapel Hill 800 you know where all eyes in the Commonwealth will be tuned Virginia Virginia Tech rounding out the day on the ACC Network here is Tyler Boston for the crew out of Worcester know 47 miles from the town that bears his name for the DMV kid who youve been impressed with today the freshman at the point and you know what Caleb Kenny provides hes been a leader there for some time the senior with the the Commonwealth connections the Richmond kid with his latest basket the assist from Max Green you know this game meant a lot to Caleb Kenny to come back here near his hometown and play well and he just earned his way into double figures he joins green who has 16 give Kenny 10 Trey Boston a little handsy right there I I think hes really the key to this teams success theyve got some nice pieces but hes going to have to be the one directing traffic on both ends kind of set in the tone defensively and offensively they came in with uh just shy of 30 assists 18 turnovers Maryland native avering as you said right at Double figures per contest nely Zips a pass TJ power you know powers the guy on the Virginia roster that has the connections to todays game he is a Shrewsberry Massachusetts native and before he worked his way here from elsewhere in the ACC as youre aware he made quite a high school career out of his time there in Massachusetts you know played his Prep basketball a mile and a half from campus where Holy Cross is located so you cant get any closer than that to the team and the other colors on this day very highly recruited really talented again get getting his you know his first performance Under Fire because he just hasnt played so much because hes been hurt yeah averaging right at 16 minutes has uh 28 to the tune of points per game and couple of rebounds to go with it when you think about his impact for Virginia thus far wearing that Cavaliers jersey number 23 its going to be on Kenny just a first whistled on Kenny and itll be an inbound for mcney Kenny wearing the mask at a an injured tooth early in the season Rich native making sure he protects that he is the unquestioned off the floor leader and so much of what he does on the floor earns that capability as well for Holy Cross and you said it this memorable weekend on so many levels we talked about Thanksgiving a moment ago you talk about the connections but anytime you can come home as Kenny has done its a highlight moment in your career thats for sure yeah you know he had people F friends and family from Richmond here so they dont get to travel to ler too Applause often Ney backs up and just couldnt get it to roll tried to feed the Richmond native but a little too deep underneath and Virginia reacts beautifully yeah the crowd recognizes that effort you Canon couldnt gather the handle and DeAndre Williams started some at point guard last year well at the story from threepoint land five of 22 for Holy Cross from Beyond The Arc Virginia has knocked down nine threes in the contest a help to the creation of the separation well thats our immedia timeout back with the balance of Virginia and Holy Cross in just a Music moment going be for him to look across at the other bench and see Dave Paulson a guy who has been a mentor of his along the way two guys who were friends for a long long time even back to when Ron Sanchez was in college and it was at a camp that coach Paulson was speaking at in Upstate New York he Paulson said we were running camps in Upstate New York he said I was hard on those guys in making them take the next step in their careers he said but I noticed right away that Ron Sanchez was going to be the kind of guy that made a difference no matter what he did in life and he said this he said I hope Virginia understands just how special it is what they have that was the Hy raise for Ron Sanchez from a guy who knew him from his underclassman days yeah and Coach Sanchez does have a a tremendous challenge but its a heck of an opportunity too well and hes getting ready to roll into as we talked about a couple of times that difficult portion of the schedule as you look at what Ryan Sanchez has been able to do in the tone setting moment what do you expect moving forward from this Virginia program under his leadership I I really think youll see a lot of the same kind of things and that itll just depend on what kind of progress this team can make with the newcomers a couple freshmen that are very talented and then the returnees like Buchanan and NE not to mention roodi and Murray well you hear the hand for Isaac mcney whose name you just referenced as he takes a seat after what has been a 13point day for Virginia also a trio of assist is pulled down a trio of boards as well its going to be into the hands of roie you know Ron Sanchez on hand for three of the ACC regular season crowns two of the tournament titles and six of the NCA appearances in his split time the 10 years separated into a couple of stins under Tony Bennett here we talked about it early on as a continuation of what has been and where they have certainly come home from that trip to the Bahamas when they saw two of the the best teams in the country saw Tennessee and then St Johns backto back he said they had some things to clean up but they have certainly done what they needed to do against Manhattan and Holy Cross as a coach you learn so much more about your team when theyre challenged like that playing ranked teams teams that are are comparable to the teams at the top of the ACC and Coach Paulson doing the same thing here playing a team that he wont see anybody like this in the Patriot league but he learned a lot about his basketball team here this afternoon yeah two teams with a great deal of History two coaches with a great deal of respect for one another and you know its of note 16 teams in the history of college basketball have won what an NCAA and an nit youre watching them compete with one another on the floor for the very first time in this one you saw Ames leave just a moment ago he put his day in perspective 16 points for Virginia he was a pace Setter for UVA today and a nice hand for him Sharma among those on the floor Ro still there theres a kid who spent some time in Massachusetts and pow try from the corner is Off the Mark two and change remain in with Virginia holding Holy Cross at arms length this holiday weekend yeah Andre Williams kind of tweaked that some part of his leg right there was trying to get a he was even trying to commit a foul to at the clock stop but clock stopped organically and Virginia with the Baseline out of bounds he gives way to khil Singleton and Virginia now going to bring Desmond Roberts and ice Walker into the contest we told you the story earlier the senior Walkers dad a Hall of Famer for Holy Cross and now he gets an opportunity to compete against those familiar family colors what a neat story what a really good story and there is a look at the Hall of Famer and hes going to make sure he snaps a photo to capture the moment document this moment thats right and I love the fact that hes still involved in the program yeah if you missed that conversation one of the mentors for Tyler Boston the young point guard of Holy Cross as they keep all the alum in close connection with their up and coming Stars just ahead of the shot clock winding down the shot goes up and a whistle as this is going to be a foul Anthony Robinson also seeing some moments you saw the pach tree City Georgias natives reaction to a first foul where a red shirt freshman seeing some late minutes Desmond Roberts got that shot up the bench was ready to explode they were excited well and you know the location of his preparation for his career right here right here in the Applause backyard brought down into the hands of Roberts the Charlottesville kid take another inside two minutes to play your overall thought thoughts about what we have seen from Virginia as a unit on this Friday well theyve been really solid they didnt foul they contested shots they took care of the basketball and they shared the basketball I I got to think that this is pretty pleasing to coach Sanchez float one in there as he worked his way down the lane but Singletons delivery just a little short Sharma takes his time up the floor with a minute 10 to play well another building ready to explode moment as you saw Walker fire away from Beyond The Arc senior he kind of teed that up and had a pretty good look at it well here comes a chance now for Desmond Roberts to go to the line Roberts couple of games in which he has appeared for UVA and the red shirt freshman to the line and hes able to knock it home you hear the building react to the hometown performer as he goes in the scorebook for the season another reminder that coming up the SEC ACC challenge you always want to go the other way right ACC sec challenge which is on the horizon Full Slate going to be a feast for you and all starts on the menide with South Carolina BC and you dont want to miss the Virginia women led by kamur Johnson theyll take on Auburn Thursday at six on this slate plenty of basketball for you between the two two of the power conferences in the land the expanded ACCC and SEC alike final minute at John Paul Jones Arena the seventh game of the year for a Virginia team that has been on an 80 run across the last 420 and in doing so is in the process of salting away an impressive victory yeah had a good week made progress this week no question about it came back from their trip kind of uh you know assessed what they needed to work on and I think theyve addressed uh those issues that coach Sanchez brought up here this afternoon uh as well as the other night versus Manhattan 16 for Ames 133 for roie 13 for McNeely when you talk about the usual performers so everything including Desmond Roberts in the scorebook just a moment ago and now Anthony Robinson he is going to work his way to the free throw line a good post Thanksgiving crowd here and theyre going to walk away happy before everybody headed home for leftovers know I knew I knew we were forgetting Laughter something just about 18 seconds away now attention will turn to whats taking place in in blackburg tomorrow the Commonwealth clash and then all that good basketball coming up for you in the days ahead as well but this day they will celebrate a complete effort from UVA trying to work his way into a scoring spot hean Ryan a Buffalo New York native who went to Worcester Academy tted the last shot of the day but it was Virginia shooting early on
