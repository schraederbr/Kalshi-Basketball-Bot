freshman Jackson and the former Notre Dame fire fighting Irish who was at Vanderbilt last year Van Allen Luen the Junior from Orlando in there jumping Center against Corin and its Pittsburgh with the basketball first in their blue uniforms with the gold lettering in white trim and of course the Tar Heels in that familiar white with the Carolina blue legot being hounded by Trimble and here is dun playing with that wrap on his right hand that cost him several games earlier in the season still not right shot clock down to three and from the logo Jaylen low the sophomore from Missouri City Texas gets the scoring underway then Allen Luben switched on to Jaylen low and you you cannot be surprised low takes a lot of tough shots he has not shot it well from three only 26 in conference but hes got a Ultra green light here is gdau the third leading assist man in the ACC and then RJ Davis sense his first team allam a year ago trying to get back to that form shot clocked down to three from the corner its good its a big hit you know you saw that plug Doug that we talked about in the open teams are forcing you to have to kick theyre forcing Carolina to have to kick a big opening Salvo there from Seth Trimble to knock that one down yeah Trimble only 28 on the year coming in Elliot CAU at only 30 1 so if youre RJ Davis your options are limited if those guys arent making shots well thats a big thing you know the guys around RJ Davis they dont demand attention in the same way some of their personnel did last year you know you had to guard Armando Bott with a man and a half you had to respect Harrison Ingram and cormack Ryan when you cant shoot teams are going to load up in those gaps the foul was on Trimble his first gun strong to the bucket and hes blocked by Luben tar Hills back the other way lean hustles back to steal the pass up ahead to Dun thought about it skip pass to the corner low good close out by Trimble and low will bring it back out those are the unforced turnovers Hubert Davis is trying to eliminate turnovers in the last two games have killed North Carolina like it has it R out and this is Carolinas first game since the rough one last Saturday to do and during that time Co Davis has been happy to be able to spend time and practice on Carolina more so than worrying about their opponents and hoping that his players start to do more of the little things correctly do lost it out of bounds off of piit Carolina will keep with 12 in the shot clock you know pit switched one through five in a first matchup and Duke did it the other day and you know at times it can stand Carolina up you know take some out of the stuff theyre run running forces those guards to play in isolation a lot of oneonone Davis fouled as he got into the lane in that first game Carolina led by as many as 10 late in the first half but then they made some uncharacteristic mistakes that allowed Hubert Daviss team to lose most of that lead before the break and then the second half it was just all pit Chris that the Panthers played extremely well to come up with what was a big win at the time Luben shaping up on the Block they finally find him big size advantage and he takes advantage a great recognition you know North Carolina was patient on that possession if a teams going to switch one through five youve got to find the matchup and there ven Allen Luben with the matchup on the smaller guard Isle it good post pass goes right over that left shoulder good execution and so the 68 Jun from Orlando as dun stepped into the lane early no problem as Luben completes the threepoint play after having been foued by legot Pittsburgh with a basketball down 63 Applause early laen sets the ball screen and here goes the lefthander low lost his footing and fortunate to keep possession as Carolinas Ian Jackson was the last to touch you have got to make Jaylen low play with his right hand he is a completely different player when you make him go right eighth in the league in scoring fifth in assists f fifth in steals fourth in free throw shooting the problem for Jaylen low has been the turnovers hes second in the lead in uh turnovers at three per game that and defensively he he is being picked on and its not necessarily his defense on the ball its his defense off the ball he he can he can lose focus at times and teams are going after him like how do you stop a good offensive player you make him play defense Corin from the elbow Off the Mark too with a rebound and here come the Tar Heels and Jackson the 64 freshman from the Bronx gives it back to the point guard Kau inside Ben Allen Luben good execution middle third of the floor that ball screen poor talk either youre going to switch it or youre hard showing nobody comes from the weak side to help on the roll which means it was probably confusion up top should have been switched eight unanswered for the Tar Heels dun cant stop the run UNC with it once Applause Applause again again Luben shaping up against Corin inside they dont find him bring it back out to Davis graduate student fifth year from White Plains New York going to work on the switch has Cor in defending sweet pass inside delen who already has seven points this afternoon and Davis you know made Corin work he got the switch made him work was able to get it two feet in the pain and find an angle and what a pass thats 10 unanswered for Applause Carolina cross boort done extra pass into the corner off the mark for Zack Austin pit needs a Applause Music stop Luben with a huge size advantage and again his teammates find him Van Allen Luen nine of Carolinas 12 to start pouring into the Baseline over his left shoulder and that snaps the 120 Applause run and hes wide open again I mean what help by Austin one of the best shot blockers as a guard in this league what a basket saving play play like it finds Corin Jaylen low big answer for Pittsburgh to make it a fourpoint game his second made three of the day cam Corin playing in that pocket and a nice job looking opposite and thats two threes early in this game for jayen low low recovers nicely for the steel now working on kadell low again no Corin a huge stick back and just like that the Panthers are within two a seven nothing run for pit answering the 120 run for Carolina Trimble lost it to Austin third turnover committed by the Tar Heels low now into the lane has it poked away and here comes UNC Jack Trimble tar Hills 14 Panthers 10 allow North Carolina to play in transition be it bad shots or turnovers they are the fastest team in the Applause ACC Le it tough shot along the Baseline first two points for the senior from Prince Georges County Maryland both those guards for pit are so Dynamic so Shifty and they are hyper aggressive the teams going to switch you one through five which the North Carolinas last two opponents have done that they came in prepared were going to take advantage of the matchup good roll to the front of them by vanen Allen Luben there then you take advantage of a smaller guard here good delivery nice angle and then Ben Allen again what a start for him going right after the smaller guard Music Music game face lock it off lock it in nothing look right at the camera nothing look right at Applause it there it is there it is J yeah baby I yeah nothing give him nothing Jacob unable there you go dont you blink Music them boys give them nothing hey lets go dont come on dont leave me Jr come on baby got him man good work thank you so much awes Music Applause Music Applause got Music Applause Music in this battle of bubble teams ven Allen Lou been doing his best to burst the bubble of the pit Panthers well they came in prepared again for the switching they had not seen a lot of that one one through five switching prior to playing pit the first time and then playing Duke the other day you know Stanford was in coverage and dropped coverage you know some of these other teams BC and so it was a bit of an adjustment now Dukes a different animal because of their length theyre going to make you know anything hard when theyre switching but what Carolina came in today we are going to force feed then Allen Luben or whoevers on the interior against those smaller guards if jayen low or is legged switch on to our bigs were going to punch that thing inside Hubert Davis going to his bench bringing in three fresh players great how freshman from nearby Pittsboro North Carolina along with the 60year Jaylen Withers and Jaylen Washington playing the five yo Diaz Graham out there for Pittsburgh Carolina has been connected their first six made field goals all assisted that is their seven made bucket in the first of the day for RJ Davis pit was in coverage there so they showed off of that high ball screen and then RJ Davis playing in isolation makes tough shot sh here goes leget turn the corner it was on the way down when Withers got a piece of it so count the B get four points for lean this is where RJ Davis see you know again whoever North Carolina is moving forward it starts with that guy it starts with him being that AllAmerican he was expected to be coming in Davis takes the ball in the screen froming Washington now resets with 12 on the timeline a step back over grand dam dont let number four get heated up but he is shooting it great in their last five shooting 41 much better than he has on a year hes making almost three threes a game and he is now within five of our friend Randolph childis for eighth place on the career threepointers made list in ACC history Applause under five on the shot clock dun trying to penetrate hes in trouble dumps it off uncs defense comes up with another stop this time it was Withers inside to slam the door oh it was a really nice recovery by Withers CU dun almost gets bailed out by a nice Baseline cut by Austin and then RJ Davis after the start from Ben Allen Luben RJ Davis getting in on the party here two threes working against the bigger Gamo Diaz Graham this just too much space for that guy and then what a recovery by Withers you think you got a layup no thanks Applause Music Dre with the chicken can change your Applause Music Applause a ni Applause not that was Applause same time Music at this point the ACC safely only has three teams in the field of 68 according to our Joe lardy Wake Forest is the last team in and then these other bubble teams SMU and then our two today Carolina and Pittsburgh a lot riding on the outcome of this game here today Chris yeah there is you know again youre playing other teams that are on the bubble those games become important cuz its not just about what you do its what those other teams do still a lot of basketball play both these teams have talent and you still have that ACC tournament out there which which will have a Major Impact I think on selection this is a quad one opportunity for Pittsburgh a quad 2 game for North Carolina Pitts net coming into the day is 47 while Carolina is 45 tell you what Carolina is chewing pit Pittsburgh up right now out of that high pick roll pits defense over the last two games has been a struggle you know both their opponent on have shot over 50 from the Applause field and we have seen so far this afternoon Chris late in the shot clock has been a real problem defensively for pit as well it has you know Jeff cable calling it their defensive stamina you know theyre just losing focus at the end of these defensive possessions a take away by Drake Powell Davis off the hesitation gives it back to Powell and mishandles gets it back to Davis Washington Working on Corin who blocks the shot its a held ball the possession arrow will stay down at this end as Seth crimble will check back in taking the spot of the in Jackson for Carolina well the Carolina offensive numbers they have not met a lot of resistance so far today at this end of the Court shooting a very high percentage against this Applause defense Davis on the switch has Corin defensively under five to shoot Powell on the pull up pretty stroke and that is why NBA folks are very high on number nine from Carolina oh hes had to play out of position for much of this year he is not a four more of a two three but hes had to play at the four for most of this season that was a tough shot mid midrange pullup and this is Carolinas largest lead of the game 2414 winding down to the midp point of the first half and the two players banged heads and are both holding their faces jayen low rubbing his forehead and RJ Davis as you see is prone holding his face as well Applause Applause you know this is what Carolina does and man its got to hurt you know thats what they do though theyre going to try to keep the ball on a side theyre going to bully it and really get into the ball handler and keep that ball on a side well have to monitor this Davis picks up the foul he heads to the bench and is now being checked on and I imagine we will have a concussion protocol low with the basketball stays in the game again the shot clock an issue for pit and Withers commits the foul with 21 on the timer you have got to make Jaylen low play with his right hand hes a completely different player if you he is so strong to his left both you know driving and then finishing youve got to get him going right but when you switch a big on to him and youre just not as comfortable shading it to that weaker hand this foul line has has been a real strength for Pittsburgh this year theyre the best free throw shooting team in the ACC they were plus 10 at the line against North Carolina in the first Applause matchup got to be able to play pit without fouling yeah 80 as a team which is eighth best in the country and low certainly does his part at 88 and you saw the list of players in the ACC who were intimately involved in every part of their team scoring and low is as good as anybody in that department again top 10 in the ACC in scoring assist steals free throw shooting getting it done at the uh line by the way it was good to see RJ Davis smiling on the Carolina bench hopefully he is okay and well be back in L gets one out of two as Davis watches from the bench Carolina shooting 83 so far today Chris 10 out of Applause Music 12 kadell the Maestro back out to Withers Trimble gives it back to gdau see what action they can get into with five on the shot clock Powell has to put it out witherss kept it alive but it comes to Pittsburgh and Damen D hes fouled before the Applause shot start your Super Bowl Sunday with three great womens basketball matchups Stanford and Louis Fuller at noon Eastern on ESPN 2 followed by number two South Carolina and number four Texas over on ESPN and then at 4 Eastern sixth ranked LSU will host 19th ranked Tennessee that is tomorrow Super Bowl Sunday big shaer getting it done again again at Texas that place the Moody Center will be rocking for that game against South Carolina jge Diaz Grand Off the Bench misses and it leads to a r long Miss shots lead to run outs and Carolinas as good as anybody Drake Powell now with four Applause Music points number two against Elliot gdau much to the chrin the C Brothers Jeff capable the head coach his younger brother Jason a former tarel himself let the officials have it over that call yeah thats a bad call they they bailed pit out of that possession you know North Carolina has been defensively really good on the ball this year it its been off of the ball where they have not been as precise with their defense good to see RJ Davis back out there for Carolina once again shot clock down for pit low to that left hand youve got to make him play with his right hand I mean he just is so good driving and more importantly finishing going left nine for the sophomore Applause guard then Allen Luben back in Davis rejects the screen cant get the roll fight for the loose ball Davis is after it duns on the floor Leed has a hand on it and finally the whistle comes its a help ball Kate Tyson Off the Bench for Carolina also mixing it Applause up to the left to the left there you go all jayen low is he wants to go to the left sing it come Music on look at her shes already halfway across the court before we go off the Applause air full rain Music car PR Music Applause and Applause Music Applause with those three shots were starting with Little John okay gotcha okay coming up at 630 Eastern on ESPN another Sonic Blockbuster with Dicky V making his return to see Cooper flag and number two Duke take on Clemson Little John will be rocking you can see the fans are there to welcome and there he is picked by to making his way into Little John Coliseum and of course his wife Lorraine out in front with her husband and uh its been way too long since dick has been on a call were so excited to have him back we love dick byal hell be on the call with our guy Cory Alexander and Dave OBrien and uh youre not going to want to miss it 630 ESPN Dicky V is back dick vital is the soundtrack of college basketball he was during my youth he still is to this day it is good to see him back what a fight hes had to put up in order to be back in that seat at 630 and you said it DG we will be tuned in yes it will be emotional no doubt about it cam Corin with the dunk coming out of the break pulls Pittsburgh back to within seven of North Carolina Trimble into the lane leans off the front R there the Hops that he has Hubert Davis says he actually jumps better than his older brother JP too and that second jump there we got a taste of it anyway went right after Applause low like it working on Trimble at the other end and Trimble draws the offensive foul against ish Leed yeah the other problem for jayen L has been teams are picking on him they are going after him eyes lighting up by opposing guards when they have that matchup and not only does Seth Trimble get himself to the basket but that second jump like you said Doug off of pogo stick second foul on Le back in your days at West Point when you were leading the Patriot league in scoring the other team never targeted you did that they absolutely did and and by the way I was a I was what they call a below the rim player once again a point blank look against a smaller Defender by Van Allen luin didnt get it the first time stuck with it but how hes got 11 points and and the deliveries have been on the money you know playing in the post is about where you catch it in the angle you have then Allen Luben working for his angle and the passes have been on the money and Luben being used much differently than he did last year at Vanderbilt when he put up 39 threepoint shots he has yet to try a three this year for Hubert Davis Trimble off the spin extra pass to Davis look at that ball movement to find the wide openen three and the rebound snared by K Tyson but weve got a whistle I mean you can tell the game plan coming in they they were going inside I they were going to work that pick and roll in the middle third then Allan Luben was going to roll hard gets himself a first shot and he works for multiples stays right with it nicely done hit freshman guard Brandon cumins had just come into the ball game he picks up his first foul Music Jackson back on the floor for Carolina with it draws two Defenders under six minutes to go in the first half Carolina by 11 Davis trying to lose Austin and the accs Top Shot blocker stayed right with him as the primary Defender what a defensive play I mean that is not easy starts with being a heck of an athlete you and I were doing a Pittsburgh game two or three years ago when I said I thought Moe with his three and D capability might have a chance to get to the league and he did I kind of feel the same way about Zack Austin he can shoot it really well hes a terrific athlete and you saw what he did as an on ball Defender right there against a really good player time will tell for sure airall from the corner by Jackson in the first matchup between these two teams Zach Austin had five blocks in a game all of them spectacular hes got the size to back it up 67210 a senior from Winston Salem North Carolina who played his first three years at higho University hes a real nice piece for Jeff Music C second foul on vanen Allen Luben as you see the numbers on Austin it was interesting talking to to Jeff cable before the Music game you know prior to Damen Dunn injuring his thumb they were really rolling I mean on on both they were a much better defensive team offensively Damen Dunn was he was their second leading scorer and and really a big part of that offense losing him really put them onto this you know this kind of streak they have been on where they have not played as well as they were early in the season yeah you certainly dont want to put it all on Damen Dunn but in his eight games back coming into this game pits only one twice his shooting numbers are down and you see the wrap on his hand and Coach cable very candid in what he shared with us he doesnt think Dunn is going to be back 100 healthy physically or probably mentally this year while that hand continues to improve but it seems to have thrown certain things off for this pit team he was such a good defensive piece and such a viable option on the offensive end theyre still trying to figure those things out Brandon Cummings The Freshman from Midland Pennsylvania gets rid of the basketball to G mod Diaz gram the taller of the Diaz Graham twins the older by a few minutes as well here is dun skipped to the corner Music Cummings weve got a whistle and the foul is going to go against poell who says Cummings used a chicken wing to get around me its its not a its not a foul you should commit first of all Brandon Cummings doesnt play a lot only a freshman has not played a lot you know make him shoot that shot you can afford to close out short but if he starts driving just be long and Applause big you know teams in the bonus youve got to be much more foul conscious especially one that shoots it as well from the line as P another one and one Cummings makes the front end he is an example Chris of how Mercurial freshman can be as you said minutes have been hard to come by but earlier this season Brandon Cummings scored 30 against Eastern Applause Kentucky in that game back in December he was six of eight from threepoint l he can shoot it makes one out of two from the line to draw pit back within Applause eight Trimble tries to turn the corner loses his footing and turns it over numbers for Pit Austin unable to get rid of the basketball before trimo recover done into the lane and a foul against Applause Carolina and you can see him favoring that right hand again D is in discomfort right now Applause now well maybe the right hand is the least of position yeah I think hes in discomfort for an entirely different reason who says basketball not a contact you know Damian Dunn I saw a lot of him last year he played at Houston last year he played for for Kelvin Samson and he had he had a good year it wasnt I think offensively what Kelvin Samson was expecting off of what Damian D had done at Temple but Jeff cable has a very close relationship with the samsons you know Jeff ended up taking over at Oklahoma after Kelvin Samson left there Jeff cable coached Kell Samson the son of Kelvin and they you know the CES and the samsons are very close and so I think that connection getting Damien done new look a new environment you know again was was great from the start of the year for for Jeff capable in this program then went right thumb surgery in late November missed about 6 weeks and still trying to work his way back fully for pit theres the defense from dun that Pittsburgh got accustomed to back in November and December then the foul is called and takes us to our under four media timeouts and well step away from the dean doome in this battle of bubble teames Carolina with the leag Music Music Music Music Music let Music Applause Music Music you whoever North Carolina is moving forward it starts with RJ Davis hes got two threes in this first half both of them off the dribble both of them kind of dancing in front of his Defender you know the start to this game had a vintage North Carolina start they play were playing Inside Out went strong in Vena Allen Luben and then RJ Davis his eight points coming down the stretch of this first half and you mentioned Lu he had 11 early just two off his season High which came against Stanford and Luen can score he put up 25 a couple of times last year while at Vanderbilt flying for Carolina great Jerry stack house but on the bench as we get set with 357 remaining in the first half Carolinas cooled off per the Pittsburgh defense has been better after making 10 of their first 12 Chris the Tar Heels have missed eight of their last 11 at this end of the floor here is Davis to Jackson tough shot Pittsburghs defense comes up with another stop and here comes is Leed last years ACC Sixth Man of the Year missed the reverse Applause Jaylen Washington down on the Block Trimble trying to find him steady he brings it back out to RJ Applause Davis pit not switching that one5 ball screen anymore theyre theyre just kind of showing so the guard able to stay with RJ Davis thats two tough shots at the end of the shot clock there for North Carolina wide open guo Diaz gr thats what those two Diaz Grant twins give you you know they give you a pick and pop the ability to shoot it a little pick and pop Carolina in drop little late guo Diaz grah hes wet hey W hey Music Music Applause Jeff Capel has shortened his bench in recent weeks guo Diaz Graham with his first three points of the afternoon part of an 80 run to get the Panthers back to within three there you see the twins guo is 7 feet tall Jorge is 611 guo is the older and the taller twin and he sees himself as the Big Brother both literally and figuratively in that relationship Im always fascinated by twins whether they play basketball just the connections that they have to people like you and I just cant understand well they clearly get the same haircut the same guys cutting both hair great Powell off the back iron Cummings getting more minutes off the bench for Pittsburgh Elliot KOB back on the floor for Carolina guarding Cummings in the corner playing with those two fouls just over two minutes remaining here in the half trying to get a step on Davis turns around in the lane good looking under control move really nice so me he got to his spot used that pivot foot and hes got a little size on RJ Davis so once he got to that spot knew hed be able to rise up over the top first made bucket of the day in this homecoming game for the young man from Kinston North Carolina tremble again like the Poo stick getting that fo back hes so athletic big part on those drives is just getting the ball up to the basket and then that second jump does the work on the followup you know Chris he finished third in last years ACC Sixth Man of the Year voting as Cummings makes the three he had a really good sophomore year trying to build on that here as a junior at Carolina Washington draws a crowd and a foul will they get done the prim primary Defender no they get Austin the helps side Defender for his first personal foul those two bigs for North Carolina off of that high screen they are rolling right to the front of the rim and if youre going to show up top that helps side as you mentioned Doug you have got to come over earlier and higher you have got to meet that roll guy you meet him too low you hes right to the front of the rim these bigs you know mostly Luben but but Washington there these bigs have got a nice job out of that middle pick and roll that was the seventh team foul on Pittsburgh so a one and one with Washington making front end how much does Carolina Miss Harrison Ingram this year there was the chance he could come back and fill that four spot like he did last year but decided to turn pro hes in the G league right now how much would that have changed this year forun for Carolina him and cormack Ryan I would love the two of them I mean Ingram eight rebounds a game you know versatility but the thing with those two guys also Doug is they were grownups I mean you had two grownups in your locker room along with Bott D lost it still loose trembles got it for Carolina Davis is fouled at about the free throw line by Cummings thats where a lot with RJ Davis you know last year he could he was playing oneonone a lot whereas this year hes playing you know against multiple Defenders because of Carolinas inability to shoot it from the perimeter but RJ Davis didnt have to be that galvanizing leader he could just go out and hoop I mean you had three grownups and Ryan Ingram and Bott who did a lot of Dirty Work defensively who did a lot of work so theres just been a lot more outside of what teams are defensively able to do to scheme against Davis because of the people around Davis theres also a leadership component that I think this team is lacking at times missing those three Veterans as you saw some of the numbers he has put up in now his fifth year as atario hes number two all time in program history points behind Tyler h Pro whose hit ACC record Almost assuredly Is Out Of Reach RJ now with 10 points for the Tarheels low finds Corin couldnt finish and its off of they say Carolina I thought Corin was the last to touch it Corin plays hard man he plays with a motor I love his energy its not always going to be pretty look like they missed that Applause one the displeased folks here in Chapel Hill letting the officials know as theyve watched it on the Jumbo Tron the same way weve seen the replay Applause low trying to get back to that left hand under 10 on the shot clock Trimble staying right with him here mod Diaz Graham gets it back to low its a shot clock violation because he missed the iron great possession great defensive possession by North Carolina Starks with Trimble on the ball Mak it life hard for Jaylen low and then RJ Davis does a nice job helping off with that pick and pop for Davis calls timeout we will be back in 30 Music seconds were not mad at you were not mad at you Music Applause Music Applause heres that defensive possession that last one there that forced the shot clock violation it starts with the pressure on the basketball Seth Trimble trying to keep jayen low to that right hand low gets back and then you get really good help off of this High screen look at RJ Davis come over here off of this pick and Pop theres Diaz he theres RJ Davis showing allows Washington get back and then you force a tough contested shot and then a shot clock violation so now where does Carolina go here with 76 on the time I think you get kdo on the run you get something up on the backboard and then you crash heres kdo on the run three seconds 2 seconds back to Trimble good close out by Austin makes it a tough shot well defended by Pittsburgh to close out the half Applause Music heres Kau to the corner pass a bit High and a turnover to start the second half the fifth of the game for the heels and they stay T of the ball off of that high ball screen you force a tough skip pass and again taking care of the ball was Priority One offensively for North Carolina did a pretty good job in the first half of that you start the half with a turn over well we get inundated with Statistics as we all do in our world of being sports fans in 2025 and uh a lot of the numbers I just kind of bypassed what Im curious about Pittsburgh has won its last three games coming to the dean which to me is very very surprising it matches the second longest streak for an opponent coming into this building ever wake did it back in 020304 Duke won four in a row here against Carolina back in the late 90s and early 2000s but is there anything to be made that recent pit success over the last four years coming to Chapel Hill make your its a good question I I dont know Doug you know I I think you know perhaps winning one then you feel comfortable the next time I mean its its a good question and I dont know if theres any carryover at all dun makes a pair after Luben picked up his third personal hit beat Carolina less than two week ago in Pittsburgh Carolina trying to return the favor between these two teams that are in the next four out on the bubble according to Joe lonardi and again he said this is not a playin game between these two teams its a play out and of course weve got another month to go in the regular season and the ACC tournament so youre not out if you lose this game obviously but its an important game for both Applause sides D passs it on that matches a season High a Carolina high for Ben Allen Luben and he is these they have delivered the ball to him on the money today where hes just had to catch and go to finish again he was a top 100 recruit coming out of Orlando a big get for Mike BR Carolina that played last year at vanderville cam Corin played well for pit gave them very good minutes in the first first half thats 10 points now for the Junior from adland Texas Pittsburgh has led just once today they L three nothing and thats when Carolina rattled off 12 straight points and they have not trailed since Ian Jackson along the Baseline left his feet Carolina will keep with 29 on the shot clock hes operating off the side again I mean thats core defense by Jaylen low just you know opens the gate and a very nice delivery by Davis and then theres Corin you know hes been very good out of that short roll off of the high screen he gets into that pocket catches and he plays with such a Applause motor Jackson gives it back Kad couldnt make the shot after beaing the shot clock buzzer so Pittsburgh with a chance to take its first lead since three zip Austin got it his first points come out a triple and put the Panthers back in front I dont think you can come that far off to me thats overh helping especially with the shooter Zach Austin is hes 39 on the year coming in Davis off the bounce answers hes got a dozen and were tied at 39 Applause G back to Corin he set the screen nice shot from about 14 ft away corins now got a doer and there Damen dun does a nice job dragging Luben with him off of that screen and Corin in that short Applause roll Kido to Luen back out to Davis Trimble in the corner again dying to drive that Bas line against Austin Luben feeling it 15 points for for V Allen Luben all the guards in this game who knew it was going to be a battle between V Allen Luben and cam K going at it Luen with 15 Corin with 12 Long rebound comes to Trimble off the leged Applause Miss K glances over at his fourthe head coach Hubert Davis who calls out of Play Lets see what the Tarheels have in store here K splits the double team tremble wide open in the corner for three thats the impact of bell kadoo again he only played nine minutes in the first half the game changed when he went out what a nice job splitting that using that pivot forp to find Trimble four assists now for cadell Trails only Nate George of Georg attack and Chucky heurn from Louisville an assist per game this year in the ACC Here Comes DAV low on the reaching foul theres been Allen Luben he and cam Corin going back and forth pivot there A Little Fall Away on that good touch and the split here do have a live dribble picks it up but steps through good find and Seth Trimble with his second three of the Applause game Len takes a seat with his 15 points Kau plays on he has yet to score but again when hes in the ball game the offense just works better for the Tar Heels Low by the way picked up his second foul now four minutes gone here in the second half 61 sophomore from West Orange New Jersey off the fade screen finds Davis who buries the three set play they just ran him over the top and he just makes a heck of an individual Play What a shot hit down six here mod Diaz Graham answers with a triple of his own big answer that quiets the crowd here at the Smith Center for the moment Davis working on leg it Applause RJ Dave has been working been working off the balance theres that catch little step through little Sizzle hes wet and then this play starts to get loud and camro Diaz grhs says Nah not on my watch hes so wet Music Music Applause let go guard Applause Music you aeir Applause Music Applause hey buddy how are you buddy you doing okay yeah how here you look good feel you sit down for a minute my legs Im going to off yeah okay Music we are just over an hour away from Dick by tos return to the airwaves this was moments ago with Brad Brown L at Little John Coliseum as they get ready for Duke and Clemson the game in and of itself Chris is going to be a huge matchup perhaps Dukes biggest conference test of the season but the fact that Dicky is there makes it all that much better how about that what a scene you knew how happy he was going to be back in a gym back calling a game and hes got a good one that place is going to be lit well you and I have both worked with Dicky V limited over the years but the energy that iss around him that emanates from him is remarkable its palpable when you walk into a room like that with him hes hes a fixture and hes always got a crowd huddled around him always ready to to have live by the way just over 5 minutes gone here in the second half of the dean Damien done with the basketball for Pittsburgh and hes going to be called for a traveling violation Carolina gets it back up three after the seventh turnover by the Panthers out of the timeout Jeff cable trying to isolate Damen Dunn the fifth year guy against the Freshman pal and pal does a nice job just staying in front staying with length and forcing the turnover Applause heres Gau into the lane brings it back out Washington pull and low crashes for the defensive rebound low average is over four rebounds per game again hes a stat sheet stuffer who might work his way onto a AllStar team or two hey look whos in the house Anan Jon learning some of the finer points of basketball from the great the inimitable Freddy Kyer couple of proud Carolina grads right there as Elliot Kau has picked up his third personal foul wonder what Freddy and anine were talking about looking deep into those game nums its always cool when you come back here to see all the banners course Jameson is up there po blocks the shot from low who gets it back puts it up no Diaz Graham has it poked away cleanly by Elliot kadoo playing with those three personal fouls and then low is whistled for the foul at the other end what a job on the other end by Drake pal two possessions in a row defensively caught oneonone and then Jaylen low has to leave the game now just with his third it just again a bad defensive play by low I mean when ball handlers see him on them their eyes are lighting up and they are going right after Jaylen Applause loow Trimble hanging in the air no Cummings back into the game getting more run here this afternoon for Music Pittsburgh dun leans in for the contact lost the basketball on the way up it goes out of bounds back near midport the official look at each other and its Carolina basketball yeah thats where Jaylen low on the bench you you lose not just his scoring but you lose his ball handling jayen low has the ball a lot he initiates their offense he gets them into their stuff when you dont have that guy pit is a different team obviously how long do you imagine he will be on the bench it depends on on what this differential does I think with a guard you can be more willing to to play a player like that with foul trouble good job defensively by Dio Diaz gr to go straight up there he is on the offensive glass but he couldnt Coral it off his leg and out of bounds P to the tarel you know pit is the worst rebounding team in the ACC they they only grab about eight offensive rebounds a game two possessions straight where G guo Diaz Graham carves some space he has the ball in his hands and he just cant possess Applause it low watch is with those three fouls Jaylen Washington back in for Carolina this is CDO guarded by Cummings at Music midcourt theres Davis who earlier this game passed the 2500 Point threshold in His Marvelous 5year Carolina career the second leading score in program history Drake Powell Ducks under couldnt get the rim shot clock down to one as the ball went out of bounds doesnt matter cuz its Pittsburgh basketball its not a great shot by Drake pal you know you you got to get to the to the middle of that paint and either rise up and take your shot or spray it out to the perimeter its a soft shot in a game like this a one possession game these possessions start to magnify its a there a a soft take in there pit has a chance to retie it dangerous pass nice job by Corin to gather it working on Luben and luans going to be called for the foul to the Chagrin of the folks wearing Carolina blue and that is number four its big I I thought it was a foul live I think it was the delay on the call I dont know what took the official so long not your classic post entry pass but it worked out yeah I mean no when those arms are impeding the offensive players ability to get into his shot its going to be called it just is a delay on blowing the whistle movement still on the floor but Washington is at the scorer table and will come in after Corin misses the first in the great words of Rasheed Wallace Carolina Legend ball dont lie this for cookies if he misses but Corin got it and now well get our first look at James Brown a 610 in freshman from Aurora Illinois Illinois with a foul trouble to Luben coach Davis going a little deeper into that bench he has a Washington headbut at the scor table lets hope everybodys okay Elliot CAD left his feet thinking about dunking it hes back on his feet but a pit Defender is still slow to get up thats Brandon Cummings and he was grabbing that right ankle what a take by kadu I mean the the acceleration out of the blocks and then he goes to punch it over a 7 foot Defender holding that right foot or ankle foul goes against guo Diaz Graham who denied the dunk attempt but picks up his second personal you that thats one of those takes Doug where I dont think he had any shot of finishing that as a dunk but when youre the aggressor when you go hard youre going to get a call thats a different thats what Im saying about Drake Pals play a couple possessions prior like you get in there and you go aggressive good things will happen first point of the ball game for Elliot Kau and it makes it a threepoint game again Cummings able to walk back to the bench under his own power retying that right shoe Applause legs had a quiet day offensively beautiful drive and Dish what a nice job drawing that that helped Defender James Brown helped up right at the last second good drop off by leg Trimble was slow to get back up you know hes on Pace to be the first Carolina basketball player under 6 4 in to lead his team in rebounds for a season hes been replaced in the lineup for Carolina by Ian Jackson The Freshman out of Our Savior Lutheran High School in the Bronx first show a Zone from either team today inside to the Freshman draws a double team unable to finish is James Brown got to come away with points there like it quick first step and the whistle against James Brown who picks up his first foul of the ball game but the day from cam Corin 15 points on the day starts with this drive two feet in the paint help comes up drop off he punches it home Music hey Music here Music Music this is an ESPN Sonic Blockbuster W this is star power from the jump number two Duke Clemson tonight on ESP we go Applause Applause conat look at that let of hands up and te this is an ESPN Sonic Blockbuster W this is star power from the jum number two Duke Clemson tonight on ESPN a chance to see Cooper flag and a chance to hear Dicky V coming up over on ESPN Clemson last four meetings against ranked opponents you see what they have done and during that last timeout this place turned into what sounded like the Phoenix Open with the noise that was made for this golf shot its a heck of a Applause putt would we show it to you if you didnt make it I to find out what he want it might have been a dozen eggs with the price of eggs these days he needs security to get out of here that foul by the way was against Jaylen Withers not James Brown that has Leed at the free throw line and now a second consecutive Miss free throw would provide cookies and again the great disappointment here in Chapel Hill fifth time weve tied here today 48 all Pittsburgh and North Carolina in what Joe lonardi calls a play out game for these two bubble teams Drake Powell not a good shot on the step back over the sevenfooter twopoint shot in the midrange off the dribble over length its the perfect storm of a bad shot Corin tries to give it back to leget Kad got a hand on it for the lead leg it was short on the triple Carolinas gone scoreless for more than five minutes to allow Pittsburgh back into a 48 all timee each of these teams in the first half had double digit runs Carolina rattled off 12 in a row Pittsburgh answered with 10 straight Davis off the great head fake missed the runner lucky there I dont know what Damen dun was biting Applause on Austin got it Pittsburgh 51 North Carolina 48 thats what he does he is a catch and shoot guy and hes only got 10 assists all season so you know hes not pass he wants to catch and shoot from Applause three Jaylen Washington hands it back to the point guard CAU into the corner now thats a better shot for the Freshman Drake Powell have his feet set catch and shoot seven points P the rookie out of Northwood High School in nearby Pittsboro North Carolina Jaylen Washington draped on over Corin who will head to the line fou number two on Washington this is what Zack Austin does three quarters of his shots are from three this season and he could shoot with range and then Drake pal has given them good minutes today hes played you know some nice defensive possessions and outside of a couple bad shots he steps into that one there non shooting foul so Pittsburgh keeps it trying to find Corin battling Washington Applause inside dun down the lane hangs in the air no another denial This Time by Washington and here comes RJ Davis had Leed on skates and he picks up a foul dun is still on the floor at the other end of the floor now hes holding that left elbow fou called on leged his third and dun is still on the Applause floor well if he came down on it or not hes grabbing his leg there underneath once again though Drake pal was was matched up against dun and just forced a tough shot again dun underwent right thumb surgery in late November sat out seven games this is his ninth game back but he with the assistance of Jason Cel is back to his feet but not feeling very well hes got aches and pains all over you know I I give Damen dun a lot of credit with the thumb not being completely healed and and Jeff Cap will telling us before the game like he has a hard time dribbling its affected the way he shoots cuz it is his shooting hand theres a lot of players now no doubt with where we are culturally who do not play until they are 100 healthy and theres a dude who has showed a lot of toughness coming back when he probably wasnt completely ready and stepping into this lineup for Jeff Caper in his sixth year in college he sees the end and wants to play every minute he can he SP four years at Temple including a medical red shirt year hes a 1000 Point scorer and as weve talked about spent last season coming off the bench for Houston before transferring to Pittsburgh Jaylen low having a conversation with John gaffy one of our three officials here today and now RJ Davis he of 252 career points Carolinas alltime leader in made threes closing in on Randolph childis the Wake Forest great for eighth on the alltime ACC list for made threes and again youve always got to put the caveat that it is a 5year plan just like all the Armando Bott numbers and for all the other players who have benefited from the co year but that doesnt diminish the remarkable career Davis has had oh it just puts it in context you still got to go go out and make those shots and get those points hes got 16 today and hes got Carolina back in front by Jaylen L back on the floor for pit fing with those three fouls here Mo Diaz Graham off to cam Applause Corin low lost his footing keeps his balance under 10 to shoot low down the lane over Davis for two to his left he wants his left hand and hes an excellent finisher going left Chris thats our sixth lead chain of the game as you see Lows in double figures now coren leads pit with 14 points great look to the diving Washington the feed from Powell and the foul against Pittsburgh theres got to be a delay I might be hearing a delay on these whistles cuz that was another clear foul whistle comes late really good action there by North Carolina heres his low play he gathers himself good composure and then he gets to that left hand hand and it seems like RJ Davis forcing him that way but I Im telling you he is a completely different player when you make him play righthanded third foul on G mod Diaz Graham so he and low have Applause three on the other side Ben Allen lubins got four fouls Elliot Kau has three that graphic of of how good low and leged were together in the first matchup is leged Carolinas done a nice job with him today made life hard you wonder if hes got a bucket here down the stretch if he can get a little bit of a run going for pit weve talked a lot about how important a win would be for both of these teams today Carolina has played the 11th toughest schedule in the country this year and in one possession games they are four and five and this one looks like its going to be a one possession game right down to the wire Le it on the midrange puts Pittsburgh back in front theyre at their best offensively when those two guards get going when they when they are playing well Applause together Davis draws the second Defender that leaves a man open in the corner but Trimble cannot make the shot what youve been talking about all game Davis always is playing against two or three Defenders this year kicking to a low percentage shooter from three and that was an early one I think you can work to get a better one than that last possession low turns the corner with Powell in Pursuit howw got a piece of that pass Austin saves it five on the shot clock low looks up going to have to put it up the Carolina Defense Forces a shot clock violation Music can Carolina finish a close game here today against Pittsburgh we will find Music Music out listen to this last week Music Applause Bost in 3 minutes 48 seconds he sh the colle and Applause h Music this Applause he Applause Music I love this what vintage a maybe into the 90s video game to illustrate the jhawk punching the tarel the tarel taking out the flyer and on and on Carolina has been in a lot of one possession games so far this season Chris I think were going for Mortal Combat there I like it uh loved video games from back in that day yeah yeah I mean look its its been you like the tree the tree I cant even go Im not going any further what a graph what a job by production awesome well uh coach Davis and his star player RJ Davis trying to figure out how to win a one possession game potentially here 716 remaining second half with Chris B Doug Sherman heres a formula for not winning a close game Carolina has missed nine of its last 10 shots and its kind of a carbon copy offensively to what happened at the Peterson Event Center couple of weeks ago when pit came back to beat the Tar Heels shot selection and that you know that was a Duty one there two threes from Drake pow both of them massive seventh lead change Powell now with 10 car heels back up two that was one of those is that the shot we want yes it is well he shoots a good percentage and if hes open I think Id want him to take it you thought he was open open enough he is for me there you go I want to play for you low to the corner like it spins into a double team Austin beats the buzzer nothing but net a huge three he hit some big threes in that first matchup too down the stretch of that Applause game no surprise that all of Austins offense have has come from behind the line Kau dribbled it off his foot he and luget get tied up and itll go the other way shooting 31 from three in conference but hes hit two big ones in this second half close out there hand in the face nothing but net and then heres the answer from Zack Austin catch and shoot sniper also well Applause contested low and Corin giv it it back and forth now leg it from the right wing tremble with another rebound Carolina down two with the basketball Kau works his way into the lane fakes the pass now back outside to Music Trimble then Allen Luen back into the game for Carolina set the screen now posting up down Applause low K loses the defender and Banks it home what a discard of Diaz Graham to get it back to that left hand said byebye first made field goal by kadoo gives us our eighth tie of the game blow dumps it off Austin mishandled right to or leg it and the foul committed by Trimble thats his second yeah you switch on to these guards look at this discard see you what a finish yeah again he only played nine minutes in that first half they they were up 11 when he left the game thats where I thought the game changed in that first half him having to go to the bench with foul Music trouble and each time Carolina has scored pit has had an answer here on the other end leg it puts Pittsburgh back in front and make no mistake kadoo is a pass first point guard third in the league and assists at this point of the season and hes the first tarel since the great tendle Marshall with four career double digit assist games but they need some points and some scoring out of them as well at least to be a threat timeout called with just over 5 minutes on the clock not surprisingly a tight ball game between pit and Carolina Music Music Applause 6 6 Applause Music Applause Music you e Applause Music Applause Music Applause Music Doug Sherman Chris P here at the dean doome and only those great Duke teams from the late 90s and early 2000s have ever

quad one Victory so coveted at this time of the year for a bubble team that threepoint line is come up big for both teams in this second half both teams four of seven from three Davis CDO and Trimble around the perimeter Powell and Luben inside for the Tar Heels Davis brother Kad going to work on low Elliot Gau now with Five Points 60 a piece open side pick and roll when he got into the lane it was another discard I mean he just shoved Jaylen low out of the way the lob to the rim and Corin throws it down Pittsburgh 62 Carolina 60 both teams exec uting out of their respective timeouts both teams coming away with points waren with 17 points the lead pick Luben tried to throw it down off the beautiful action great feed from cadu its almost like he lost it trying to go onehanded its a big Applause Miss under four minutes in regulation spotting up for three Austin missfires Ming with the rebound and here comes RJ Davis kot to the open man in the corner back out to the trailing Trimble draws the contact and theyre going to count the basket and a chance for Music Applause three theres Elliot K and that open side pick and roll watch the discard byebye another finish at the basket for

Carolina good balance four different Tar Heels in double figures what will be the difference in the final three and change for you Chris well I think the foul line first and foremost big free throw here for for Seth Trimble and then any Scrappy stuff you know neither team has done anything really on the offensive glass but those second shots become big this play out of the timeout you know both teams have done a nice job executing out of timeouts today Pits got a chance to draw one up on this next possession they had the lob dunk out of the last timeout St Trimble making his fourth start in a row connects on the free throw that gives Carolina another lead our eighth lead change of the second half Austin puts it on the deck picks up the dribble low to his right hand trying to get back to the left hand to shoot it and the foul is called against tremble didnt need it it was well defended like you said you had to get going to his right hand which is what you want low doing and all you got to do if youre set Trimble Youre athletic enough just keep that arm up a nice job by low kind of embellishing and drawing that call and so they didnt get tremble Chris its on Drake Powell who picks up his second as the help Defender big free throws this free throw line and these these high leverage games games won or lost at the line pit has the right guy at the strike the Panthers are ninth in the country as a team at 80 shooting foul shots and low is nearly 90 on the Music Year this will give him 13 points and give Pittsburgh the lead back Applause Gau rejects the screen lob it inside Luben comes down with it puts it up and in and the foul Ben Allen Luen now with 17 points continues to do damage inside against Pittsburgh this is how they started the game you get the switch then Allen Luben gets the smaller jayen low on him and thats just too deep he goes right up its a bad foul Carolina on one end with a bad foul putting low to the line and then there just you know give up that layup and lets lets transition to offense bad foul Carolina high for Luben this year mki scored in a Tar Heels uniform missed the free throw Applause second Defender gets the ball out of the hands of low Austin gives it back to him T to shoot down the lane up Cory tried to throw it down couldnt Carolina with it Kau has it poked Away by legant Davis thought about the three now pulls up from 15 little bit short big rebound for Corin Pittsburgh has it down Applause one waren sets the big screen now low into the lane to the right hand BS it in Panthers back in front a nice job putting the defender in jail keeping him on his back buying his time and that is his first finish going right all day corins got 17 points low got Applause 15 kot Ling I think the big fella got a piece Gear mod Diaz Graham with a clean block up top well he did a good job he he looked like he wanted to try to draw the charge and then just stayed big used his size to force a tough shot shot over that length jayen low you know North Carolinas going to have to off these ball screens get the ball out of his hands really nice job off of this putting Seth Trimble in jail just got him on his back and then Corin just seals off Luben at the last second and he finishes to his right and heres this defense from he wanted to charge nope nope nope and a nice job just being long and big forcing a tough shot yeah when youre seven feet and that long that is good defense just stand and put your arms up from your lips Doug Sherman well theres our reset both teams in the bonus Pittsburgh now with only one time out remaining the ever important possession arrow belongs to the Tar Heels in this game pitting two teams according to Joe lardy are in the next four out with a month to go in the regular season now whatever this is for pit its got to start with jayen low youre in the bonus put the pressure on North Carolina to have defend you off of the dribble y Mo Diazs Grand Pass is knocked Away by Powell what a play by pal basket saving play timeout Carolina but we will get you to a terrific MBC matchup Illinois State at Northern Iowa scheduled for a 600 Eastern tip here on ESPNU those two teams battling Bradley Belmont UIC everybody chasing Drake where Ben colums done such a good job we will get you there just as soon as we get done here in Chap Hill here North Carolina sent two to jayen low off of the ball screen cam corn was wide open all all you got to do if your Diaz Graham is complete that pass you get a dunk what a play by Drake pal he has come up huge in this second half and it started with his Music defense Carolina led by three at halftime they led by as many as 11 in the first half but its been close pretty much throughout Pittsburgh used a 10 run late in the first half to make it a Tight Ball Game and they have been trading blows throughout the entire second half as we have seesawed back and Music forth hard to beat a February Saturday afternoon here at the Dean Smith Center all the Carolina blue fans banners hanging up in the Rapters and a tight ball game with just over a minute to Music go in the second half Chris weve had nine ties and 11 leaching its been a heck of a game theres a lot riding on this game for both teams when it comes to NCA tournament implications this got to start with RJ Davis you know run him on that flare they like get him curling into the lane and that if it breaks down Elliot cdos penetration has been a killer youre in the Applause bonus one minute left in the second half under 10 of the timer Davis crosses over low step back long two got it Carolina retakes the lead well for most Shooters the percentages go down when you are shooting off of the dribble not RJ Music Davis he has taken a ton of shots off of the bounce today and come up big and theres that matchup you want jayen low on you Davis got to his spot Rises up and he drops it through he is wet from what youve seen over the last four or five games in here this afternoon do you feel like RJ Davis is getting that 2023 24 mojo back yes I I think RJ Davis is at the point where he is saying Im not missing the NCA tournament Im not going out like that and I think all of the pressure he had on him coming in its a different Dynamic this team than he was playing with last year hes had a lot thrust upon him I dont know if he was necessarily ready for it or this team was ready to compliment him I think all three of their guards all think theyre the best player thats the guy and I think he has absolutely stepped his game up over the last five and I think he is ready to carry that forward this would be a quad two win for for Carolina had a nice piece on their tournament resume for Pittsburgh its a quad one opportunity and lets see how the Panthers respond coren leg it low in the back court y mod Diaz Grant puts it on the floor leg it lost it Lowes got it t on the shot clock 30 seconds left in regulation low for the lead no Luben had it back to low who puts it up no this time Luben secures it out to RJ Davis and weve got a foul with 198 on the clock what a back and forth started with a great defensive possession just an excellent defensive possession here you force a tough shot and then low gets it back and I you can get a better one yeah I dont think you had to rush that there pull it back out reset and get a better shot you you just kind of panicked in that moment and there he goes the postcript to that sequence that Pittsburgh will think about if they lose this game is that their All Conference Point Guard just filed out and so now the Panthers bring their freshman Brandon Cummings back onto the floor for the final 198 seconds its one and one and youve got to be ready to rebound this is not a good free throw shooter at the line you cannot give up an offensive rebound and then you do not need three yet well well see what he does at the line here a one and one for the junior out of Orlando Christian Pratt missed it h had it Luben knocked it away and its Carolina Ball but they will review it so the all important call on the floor is that its Tarheels Basketball as we take another look yeah I think thats going to stay that way it looked like Diaz Graham hit it at the last second there and this is the third time today yeah thats going to be Carol stay Carolina ball its the third time today that Diaz Graham has had an offensive re or rebound rather in his hands that hes had knocked out and how about the free throw shooter then Allen Luben yep getting that ball back for his team and just a few moments Chris after he got two off or defensive rebounds rather as they were keeping Pittsburgh at Bay Luben has been so good the scoring might be the headliner for him the most points hes ever scored as a tarheel but his work in other aspects has been just as critical so theyre working on getting the time as well on the video review on the four stands white basketball with 183 on the clock John GNE letting us know and then Eric Lewis letting the audience know here inside the D coming up next to Illinois State will be taking on Northern Iowa they just make this hard a hard inbounds pass and youre going to have to f if youre Applause pit Carolina does have a timeout this looks like will be Carolinas 10th onep possession game of the season got to get it in they do to Trimble and there the foul is committed trimbles an 84 foul shooter third foul on comings so Carolina got it into the guy they wanted fifth best free throw shooter by percentage in the ACC he and RJ Davis both terrific Luben comes back in Washington goes out and its kind of a carbon copy of where we were a minute ago when Luben was at the line just a much better free throw shooter this time for the Applause heels he did what Luen did and Pittsburghs got a chance to win it Le is going to use that last Pittsburgh time Applause out well you dont have the shot Creator in jayen low the rest of these guys are playoff guys hes even is leged who I think this is this play is going to be drawn up for hes much better playing off of low but youve got to stay home got to be aware of Zach Austin is and then weve Al also seen pit out of timeouts run that log where you get that high screen and they got Camp corn rolling to the rim for a lob dunk in this second half but having Jaylen low out of this game it changes this final possession obviously well Hubert Davis has spent all week in practice and really all season long preaching to his team about doing the little things and if Carolina winds up losing this game they will look back and see that in the second half Chris they were only four of 10 so far from the free throw line including missing the front end of two one and ones in the last few seconds these games Doug it its you know these high leverage games they are usually one or lost at that foul line important to keep in mind pit does not have a timeout so you youve got to get the basketball in bounds in these situations that inbounds passer becomes the most important player on the floor as you see car Carolina has the only timeout remaining and also possesses the arrow but Pittsburgh will have a chance to win it 135 seconds without Jaylen low who fouled out just a short while ago so itll be Zack Austin to inbound on the sideline alongside that Pittsburgh bench here at the dean Austin Cummings Coring G Mo Diaz Graham a body goes flying leot gets back up got to get it in Corin has it knocked away Trimble keeps it alive still loose out of bounds Pittsburgh basketball wow what denial and with no time out pit had to get the basketball in bounds what a sequence what a layout you think the guys dont want it what a layup set Applause tremble and so now Pittsburghs task just got a little tougher but theyre fortunate to keep possession now theyve got it in the back court with 7even seconds you got plenty of time to drive the basketball Carolina does not going to want a foul youre in the bonus Drive the ball and get it up on the backboard Leed 5 Seconds four seconds legot draws contact puts it up no and Carolina survives
