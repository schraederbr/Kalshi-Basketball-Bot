about the since the card have faced the card we got to make sure only one of these groups have a plural to it yep so hang on to your S as we get going today from The Young Center heres heon and the cards wear red against the Cardinals who are in their black Noah Waterman draws the start today rain Smith will not play the terrific Sharpshooter off of Pat Kels roster this year his first year at Louisville in has done just a marvelous job he has doubled the total in wins of what Louisville posted in the previous two years combined Edwards with one to shoot three nope long two bounds away Reno his first rebound and a great patient defensive possession right there by the Cardinal enforcing a tough shot at the end of the shot clock off the mark osiah sers on the dump down to rno you see immediately going to double team rno when he catches the basketball on the Block tend to shoot for jayen Blakes hes got Scott there he the steel on the knock away the accs leader in steals comes away with one Applause early Louisville is not shy when it comes to offense heres heer on the drive lob Scott the catch it done you know the best part about that the timing of Scott I believe Ray no have gotten a hand on that live attempt however James Scott still able to adjust and finish it for two 69 dunks on 94 made field goals this year Cory for James Scott and throw one three in the with that you talk so its not all about the dunks but it is a huge part of what he does and this connection with Chucky heurn has been fantastic as you see not sure if raino got a hand on that one or not but still great timing by Scott to be able to finish it off with one of the best in the ACC with assist in Chucky hurn and consecutive turnovers on the travel and now look at here the heavy defense by Blakes against Edwards with 15 to shoot its one thing you know jayen Blakes is absolutely going to get after it drawing the assignment guarding Edwards on this possession that basketball actually went off of thatb bur osiah sers oh what a handy dribble behind the back here in traffic too strong Reno Taps it out sellers along two is good offensive rebound by Reno on that possession tipping it out that was an area where the cards got beat up a little bit by the Golden Bears on Wednesday they all they gave up 13 offensive rebounds heres Waterman heper in the corner working against Ryan Aral and now here is Javon Hadley yet another weapon in the Cardinal offense so WD Im keeping track jayen Blakes has guarded all three perimeter players on each possession of this game and been successful in doing so started the game out guarding CH Chucky HB bur on the first one then Edwards and on that opportunity stopped Happ in the corner camon back here for agarwall the sophomore from Texas outside the Dallas area R NOA three got to get out on that 55th three of the year yeah you cant give him that much space too much space for a guy to shoots it as well as rno does yep heres hman back for Scott and lets see the handoff Edwards right back for Waterman hell launch a three out of the corner thats good Noah Waterman on the board and five of his last 14 Waterman came off the bench Wednesday night very confident doing the job of both ends of the floor showing off his threepoint prise on that one just squaring up right no and knocking it down right in front of his face PE really annoying jayen Blakes isnt he he absolutely is and Chucky can absolutely get after it when you consider guys that can put pressure on you with the basketball we know what Blakes is capable of but Chucky heurn can match that Scot the rebound off the Blakes Miss tied at five and heres heurn on the quick attack nice bounce pass Waterman will slip it for Edwards now heres Scott who plays with the mask having the oral fracture couple of weeks ago about three weeks ago theres a drive and score by heer suck keer win about 12 minutes of game action before he made his first field goal on Wednesday night gets one early here but now its Edwards uhoh sers clutched it and missed it twice kind of held your breath there for a minute uh yeah but he had me almost speechless hanging around in the air I thought he going to try to dunk that oh Waterman has his three bothered by eight C the Richard freshman knocks it away seven five The Ville in front by basket here early were underway in the Music Ville it is the fifth pick thats going to be the variable in the voting for All Conference first team yeah very true but when you look at what Edwards has done its not just about his offense is what he does defensively Pat Kelsey has made it clear to us that hes the Catalyst for the reason why theyve been such a better defensive team in 2025 heres Edwards trying to shake Reno with a step back three thats too St strong Waterman battling inside it was last touch thatll stay with Louisville inside against raino scor treor who led the cards in turnovers on Wednesday is now leading them on the offensive end the second bucket for him in this one as he continues to go out and stay in attack mode it it shows you a little bit about if you havent seen the Cardinals play much this year and youre starting to see this you know kind of rejuven ation or Revival as Kelsey terms it you see the depth of the basketball team is more than scoring theyve got a lot going on here to make you believe theyre capable of winning one or two in the tournament they really do and when you consider they have so many guys that can help you win a game and we all got we got to remember theyre playing without casea Pryor who they lost in the Oklahoma game much earlier this year theyre playing Without Rain Smith and Cory Johnson so so again this Louisville team has continued to be able to be successful despite losses throughout the year and Pat Kels done a tremendous job this season but look at the PK effect the last two years 12 combined wins this season 24 wins and 17 ACC wins one more here today and they would have be a part of the record holders 18 which is the record for ACC wins in the year osiah sers three bounds away camon saved it who what a throw to Blakes its got volleyball around heres Edwards oh little hesy in the one hand first points for Terrence Edwards Jr and all of a sudden the Ville is kind of rolling here now Cory well this is what you expect to see when you come into this building 13 to nothing run in the last three minutes Blakes tries to snop it and does its a three ball from Jaylen Blakes thats a tough shot and a big shot because normally in the midst of a run the last shot you want to take is a settle three where youre just facing up your Defender but not a shot thats too big for Jaylen Blake rebound off the Miss of Edwards by Reno we talk about all the award winners the favorite for most improved player in the ACC jayen Blakes in my opinion this young man has truly been exactly what Kyle Smith needed at Stanford to help build that culture especially with his ACC experience playing three years at Duke delivered the bounce pass Ryan agarwall the layup and there goes tror the Euro failed him see that was the problem he tried to Euro against a guy from France you cant Euro against a European hes not going for that you got to go hesi like Edwards there you go yeah almost 8 minutes in sers whos had some big games in ACC play camon does not score much that one rattled out for him he starts the ball game averaging just 2 points 2 and a half rebounds in conference Play We 8 minutes in its a fivepoint Louisville Le and abubacar trayor for heurn here with t to shoot what a quick bounce pass now trayor to work against Reno now this is where r no should absolutely have it Advantage tayori trying to back him down giving away about 5 in to Rene who comes in over 7 ft tall Blakes tried to rip the bounce pass in cam a tough catch couldnt score it and the Freshman trying to fight for his right inside and draws a foul well take a break Timeout on the floor its a fivepoint lead for Louisville time is out on the floor Edwards combination not available today its another guy who scored 30 Javon Hatley had 30 plus against Clemson earlier this year not just next week in Charlotte where I think they are a real threat mm that ball got knocked away from Maro by Scott if they defense is emerging as Pat Kelce tells us and their threat of just the variety of guys who can score it Cory my Heavens theyre going to be hard to get ready for they absolutely will be extremely difficult to get ready for especially when you dont know if youre going to be playing them in the next game so thats the problem when youre looking at the fact that Louis will have a double buy that means that whomever theyre playing will have played a game the night before Fall Away by Scott or beg pardon thats Ruth Kai Roose the freshman and hes recovery no good Reno challenges and finally it is akara Chism akara the junior transfer from Harvard who comes away with it but WD we talk about those four 30point scores SC and those four guys are normally in the starting lineup but maybe the most important of them all is the mash man out there in James Scott hes the guy that really makes this go from a defensive standpoint and also gives them that presence that lob threat for Chucky hurn which is such a huge part of their offense three ball by Roose and hell run down his own rebound Edwards working on sellers no backing him up and Terrence Edwards another Basket in traffic and one coming but these are the things that you dont recognize the reason why Ray no cant truly commit is because he knows that the L threat in James Scott is behind him and thats the one thing you dont want to give up which allows Edwards to be able to get his shoulders pass the defender finish through contact and get to the free throw line Music back the Music javing we welcome those of you who have just watched Georgia beat Vanderbilt in Athens to post the 20th win of the year for Mike Whites Bulldogs were at the KFC Yum Center downtown Louisville number 14 Cardinals hosting Stanford Terrence Edwards has got five Chucky heer four on the early attack for removal against one of the best players in the ACC and thats the Cardinal big man Maxim Reno as aara misses the layup off the right side and you see some of the story lines with both these teams on this final day of play in the ACC Waterman out of the right corner air ball to three and oar the rebound Louisville hitting 42 from the floor theyre just one of eight though from behind the line avering almost 10 made threes a game a similar start to what they had on Wednesday night against C got off to a slow start offensively but their defense keeps them in games until they can really get that offense going ended up being a blowout once they had a strong scoring second half Chucky heurn fighting for space inside the scooping score hes got six and Chucky heurn of course so Dynamic and delivering the basketball to his teammates suppos to six a game which is good enough for top two in the ACC often times can take it upon his own shoulders to be able to get to the rim and finish amongst the trees Terrence Edwards Jr cadir tror report back for Louisville Edwards of course coming off of a huge night Wednesday night against C had 35 just adding to the list of any guy that can go off in a game for Pat Kels first Louisville Squad here he has done a terrific job the cards are 24 six playing today got a chance to post their 18th win in the ACC aara missed the layup trayor couldnt Corral it itll stay with Stanford and a fresh 20 to shoot for Kyle Smiths team who saw Louisville going on a 130 run to post this 10point margin and KY Smith getting First Team all ACC soon to be member and Maxim Ray no back on the floor that was a quick rest yeah for Ray no of course look at this Stanford Cardinal team and theyre absolutely different without him on the court such a threat both inside and out you got aara off the floor or aara state on the floor and now Stanford going to have to use a timeout because Blakes could not put the ball in to the Cardinal bigman so a break in the action at the Yum Center the Cardinals by 10 when we come back Applause Music on Music Louisville 20 Stanford 10 back with Cory Alexander westerham here at the Yum Center and Cory when if you havent seen Louisville play this year youre just finding out about this unbelievable turnaround Pat Kelce has posted in year one one thing you need to know is theyre in merging Talent defensively in his mind and Reno fouled by Frank Anam eBay off the Baseline and that thats just a veteran smart play by Reno as hes going into his shot and catches Frank Anam eBays hand in the cookie jar goes into a shot finds a way to get to the free throw line Reno 79 hes made 100 free throws and 127 tries Maxine misses that one now did you notice little meditation place takes place here watch him hell close his eyes Cory lock in go to his happy place WD I mean absolutely youre in hostile territory right now go yeah you got to go listen they dont have an S okay its the Cardinal this is the home of the Cardinals so that means its hostile territory for my guy Maxine REO and hes got to go to his happy place at the free throw line to refocus well bought him one of two heres heper tried to dig in on geler and going to draw the foul Benny gerer the Junior from pal Verdes the States California its his first second on Stanford and thatll Put Chucky heer one of two ACC stars from Omaha Nebraska at the line the senior transfer from Wisconsin you ready to pencil him in also First Team all ACC with rno Ill put that in in dark ink pin concrete both those guys are first teamers dont forget coming up more college basketball over on ESPN 430 this afternoon oh the cats and The Jayhawks at Allen Fieldhouse 430 and then the Sonic Blockbuster tonight at Smith Center in Chapel Hill and Duke Carolina on ESPN and always available for you on the ESPN app eight for heurn Edwards has five thats 13 of the Applause 22 geler with Reno camon sers and Blakes who just committed an offensive foul another smart play by heurn just getting in the way being a pest defensively where hes been so great at all year long 24 steals per game but that wont go in as anything from a stat sheet standpoint but its just another smart play by one of the best point guards in the game Im still appalled by the fact that hes not on the Koozie yeah award watch list just amazing by the way the Blakes foul the fifth turnover of this first half on Music Stanford and Louisvilles doubled the number on the VIS visors heres trayor in traffic aning the eBay strong to the basket couldnt finish it camon collects for Stanford and the Cardinal with Benny giler bringing front court and geler who started the year out as a starter alongside jayen Blakes for the Cardinal now coming off the bench but gives him a viable threepoint threat and someone who also can handle the Rocks standing three and Blakes gets the rebound back for geler try it again two more huh yeah two for doar unable to get it going but a great effort by Jaylen Blakes to be able to come up with the offensive rebound which has been a bit of a weakness for the cards in the last couple of games and heper in traffic now with double figures zero weakness for Chucky heurn in this game abouton you talk about perfect fits this guys been a perfect fit here he absolutely has been that ball got knocked away nice play defensively and eBay heres Edwards Hadley a three ball too strong cam in the rebound but how about this crowd back reenergized emerged in this team and their success hanging on every shot in play everyone on their feet after a tremendous defensive stand Reno three bounces off one and done are the Applause cardinal trayor heres Edwards against Blakes pretty good match up here and Terrence lost it off his foot thats going to get us the timeout great matchup but its been all Cardinal a second nationally at 35 threepoint field goals a game and thats only because he missed 35 minutes of action on Wednesday night he probably would be back at first yep 15 to shoot for the Cardinal and here is Reno trying to get it the sellers Blakes hard drive in traffic and the rebound for Scott James Scott coming off the oral fracture against Miami earlier this month playing with a brand new uh Hannibal Lector mask Hadley out of the corner and theres the second three of the day for the Ville and a great play by Chucky heern really just keeping his eyes up recognizing where everyone was defensively trying to keep him out of the paint and soon as he saw the ballside help Defender coming his Direction delivered to strike the Hatley was able to knock down the three ball Reno Bullet Pass to the corner sers tries to answer Waterman the rebound feels like Louisville was doing a better job on the glass today Cory than they did Wednesday night they really are and Im sure that was a point of emphasis from their head coach Pat Kelsey who gets his point across in the most energetic of all Fashions and Chucky heurn off to a great start here in this first half 12 points for him already five of six from the field Louisville had a 13 nothing run now a N9 nothing run and S snaps it with a three from the corner thats the second time that the Cardinal have snapped a long run with the three ball however still down 15 at this point and the Cardinals having their way at home in the first half four and a half to go in the frame Edwards with Hadley Scott Waterman and he this was the starting five today for Pat Kelsey he a three at the front look at Reno go get it and now Jaylen Blakes will kind of walk with it into the front Court here with 41 to go Stanford shooting 227 in this first half and theyre coming off a night where they only hit a third of their field goals at noted aame in a tough loss missed by agarwall heres Ed Edwards Scott one dribble heer nice pass Waterman blocked by raino and thatll get us to a break out well the Cardinals have done a tremendous job throughout this one finding their teammates knocking down the three ball and on the other end oah sers returning the favor and defending the best opposing perimeter player but Chucky heer who leaves the ACC and steals so both those guys vying for First Team all defense here is heper working against C on the switch by the Cardinal now heres Ray know watch this he and he landed on the foot before he passed the ball so thats a travel Cory brings up an interesting conversation about the three teams the top three teams in the tournament I think one way or the other going to be Duke Louisville Clemson right yes both teams have a calling card at the defensive end all three have a calling card at the defensive end of the floor heres on the Ste Chucky to the well against Blakes and didnt get the bounce Hadley couldnt get the follow Javon is fouled that time on the put back by Jaylen Thompson I am very shocked that Chucky didnt drop that one off to Hatley for the dunk I thought thats what he was looking back at the entire time of course trying to get to the rim as quickly as he possibly can Blakes did a good job of Defending it but I thought that was an easy drop off opportunity for Chucky to find Hadley who of course is when you think about Chucky heurn he normally has the eyes in the back of his head finds every one of his teammates all right so let me finish this thought with you going to next week you like any of those three teams you had to pick a favorite next week Duke would certainly be a heavy favorite just based on the regular season right you you would think that but we you also consider that the Blue Devils are a different team today then they will be next week they wont have Jay Lucas one of their assistant coaches with them who has a tremendous amount of responsibility will they have Malik Brown back good point so when you think about it and again thats the team that the Cardinals played against in December so this Louisville team is a much better team today than they were in December and they have something to prove against the Blue Devils yeah the Blue Devils have something to prove against the Tigers who have something to prove against Cardinals you see where Im going here I understand yeah here is heer kick out for Scott now right back for Chucky heer thats going to be a foul on Scott as Blakes ran into it Kyle Smith applauds the call at the Stanford bench on the 611 sophomore Scott I do believe there was a little bit of sarcasm in that in that Round of Applause from just a touch from Kyle Smith as you see Scott and you got to get maybe a little bit of sarcasm in that cheer that is the fourth foul on Louisville Stanford also has four here in the first half with two and change the play Ray nos got a three and one free throw but one thing that when a Defender goes away theyre not going to vacate the space youre going to have multiple bodies around anytime raino catches the basketball especially with his back to the basket Scott picks up two quick fouls that one on Jaylen Thompson on the put back so thatll send Thompson to the line where he is seven for eight at the strike this year this uh sophomore from Applause Oakland who played 14 minutes at Notre Dame the other night had two points and four rebounds and is back on the floor here at this final minutes and change of the first half I believe Pat Kel is going to go with a much smaller lineup now breaking toor for who you mentioned just picked up that second foul this is a a lineup That Maxine REO should be able to take advantage of no one there to match his size and physicality for the Cardinals in the post but how fast will this lineup be oh theyre going to be atlen and fast whenever you got Chucky heurn on the floor youre going to be fast its something about how many guys does he bring along with it and ruths has come back into the game as well as Hadley goes to work against Blakes Chucky reacks on Blakes had it blocked out of there that was Thompson now theyll battle for it trayor always in The Fray for Louisville to Roose to Hadley blocked Reno and thats the third block of the game by Rayo but how about the effort by Trey or and what seemed to be a fast break opportunity for the Cardinal getting on the floor and only5 second remaining here the shot clock and Roger SS with Mark snur and Tony Henderson we got a final four crew by the way oh absolutely today and Pat Kelce is going to take the user to lose it here and I think Roger SS is going to go over to double check on the time remaining on the shot clock Applause okay Louisville by 13 with 143 to play here in this first half and Roger sis and Tony Henderson have gone to the monitor here for as much about possession as clock right Tor it is absolutely is when you consider this I dont know that stord after review the shot clock will be reset to 16 Louisville ball in the base there we go and a great job by officiating crew as you mentioned the final four crew but there was never possession by the Cardinal on there tayori does a great job getting on the floor getting the basketball back for the Cardinals as we continue to emphasize the plural oh you do you got youre youre youre making sure you connect the S I get you well these two teams havent play only played three times theres a reason in they their storyed history its the first time Ive done one of the games so you got to make sure we specify who were talking about you mean you didnt do the 04 the 07 game no I dont I think I was still playing there here Edwards forced a shot thats a shot clock violation and now Stanford with 100 seconds to play in this first half finds itself trailing 13 speaking of shot violation the least favorite call of my guy Roger SS does not want to touch the top of that beautiful head of hair he has no and and and he breaks it down for me its Paul Mitchell I can tell you that Im not sure which one but its absolutely Paul Mitchell styling jail that my guy uses REO missed the kind of spinning hook shot oh nice back door Roost the dunk Applause Terrence Edwards delivered a dime for the rookie dunk and Edwards not just a score he could be a playmaker as well I think hes the perfect compliment to Chuck Chucky heurn those two guys in the back court have really been special Thompson had it and then trayor had it and lost it but you see Edwards off the bounce with so much attention being paid jayen Blakes gets lost watching the basketball and a nice cut by Kai Roose to be able to get to the rim and finish it off with a 15point Applause lead sers camon back for Reno well he clutched on it now camon from the corner with t to shoot sellers with six now camon step away three and Blakes went to battle for the rebound hell be called for over the back second on jayen Blakes fifth on the card with 391 to goal basketball and here comes Benny geler back to replace Jaylen Blakes with those two fouls last thing Kyle Smith needs is Blakes picking up a cheap third going to the locker room no you dont want that to happen it looks as though Stanfords going to be falling back into a Zone defensively I think weve seen this for a couple of possessions y Music geler heres Waterman trying to beat Reno on the drive and couldnt finish it and give R Noah a tremendous amount of credit hes done the job defensively strong Rim protection for the Cardinal Max calling the play oh he can do that as well youre talking about a very intelligent young man go stford I think they all are yeah heres Reno with five three ball over the top of Bruce is too strong rebound to Hadley and from the timeline Off the Mark wouldnt have counted anyway Roger a says Louisville going to take a 3318 lead to the locker room Cory and theyre living up to the height and they Louisvilles done the job Trail Applause 15 hell be telling here in the opening few minutes of this first uh this second half here Reno with the leftand hook and it rolls in theres his second field goal but the soft touch using the left hand the jump hook and again every time he catches the basketball in the paint hes normally seeing multiple Defenders but great adjustment there by KY Smith having him post right in the middle of the paint know where the help can come from well we told you Louisville 39 from the floor just two of 11 from three though well thats a direct byproduct of no rain Smith in the start lineup this is a better defensive team with rain Smith off the floor but offensively theyre not even close without their leading threepoint shooter heern the Miss Edwards tries and camon doesnt give Louisville a third Applause chance Louisville was also plus five on the glass and plus two in turnover margin in the first half and for Pat Kelsey the thing is is finding that balance when youve got R Smith on the floor he still expects for them to be better defensively as an opportunity for offensive rebound cames out of bounds Aral got a hand on it but no teammate available to tap it out to yeah but that that balance is again you cant replace rain Smiths you know presence on the offensive end the dude that pretty much at hits four threes a game and not only is it the shots that hes making but the attention that he gets from opposing defenses that often get his teammates open opportunities PE kicks oh look at Evers Waterman slides back Baseline and scor it Noah Watermans got his second field goal a three and a two for his five and wman going off the bounds getting to the rim points to the paint as the Cardinals continue to add to this Applause lead Stanford though Trails by 50 and has just 20 points in the game and theres another Cardinal turnover but you see as soon as the basketball is delivered they already two bodies I believe they going to get Chucky heurn for the offensive foul on that one lowering the shoulder Roger a right on top of the call and Jaylen Blakes who did this his entire career at D oh my God D and this is transferred as he gets in legal guarding position and the reason why hes able to get that call notice how his hands are out defensively exposing his chest showing that all the contact is forced by Chucky heurn who just goes and takes the basketball back yeah r no finally collected and then he fired a pass out of bounds trying to go to Camp fortunate for rno thought he landed on someones ankle as he threw that jump pass coming down but an aent pass out of bounds another turnover for the Cardinal and now theyre nine turnovers already in this game of course the Cardinals forced over 13 and a half per game two and change gone here in the second half he and Louisville and going to be a foul here Roger SS on the whistle its on cam a camon the red shirt freshman his first and the First on Stanford in this second half the Cardinal have to be careful that Louisville does not throw another knockout punch remember they had run of 130 and 90 in the first half well one thing is for certain and two things are for sure its going to be a run by the Cardinals the question is can the Cardinal find one here on the road to be able to get them back into this game yeah theyve had a hard time finding any offensive momentum continuity for sure and now a foul on Waterman its a hard guard for Noah Waterman I think dont you it is but as you see as soon as the basketball is delivered theres already another Defender Hadley is on his way to help Waterman out so hes only going to have to guard for a brief period of time theyre going to force Reno to get rid of the basketball so Watermans got two Scotts got two and Kadir trayor has come back on the floor wearing 25 he defends Reno Blakes a triple outside and knocked around and it looks like Edwards saw cam touch it last and let it go out of bounds but Maxine R know immediately goes over to jayen Blakes daps him up and encourages him hes going to have to take that shot because theyre going to sit in the lap of Max REO anytime he gets the basketball Chucky heurn stayed with them forcing Blakes to have to beat them from Beyond The Arc Hadley to work against Blakes and its off Hadley and Louisville turns it over great job defensively by Blakes on that possession you see he can absolutely be just as much of a defensive p as can Chucky heurn the problem is he cant do it on the offensive end like Chucky stump for jayen Blakes potentially being the most improved player in the AC I do believe that he absolutely is you consider that he scored two points a game a season ago at for the Blue Devils as r no knocks down the corner three ball and now its up almost 12 points a game yeah a differential but more importantly the leadership hes bought I mean you got to think about this team has a chance to get to the seven seed in the ACCC and a lot of that has to do with jayen Blakes bringing that leadership and by the way hes got two gamewinners to his credit this week does pepper a three bounces out rain no another rebound eight rebounds now for maxim to go with this nine points WD for all the NBA Scouts that are in the building today theyve seen that twice where raino goes and gets the basketball at his high as Point thats what you want to see from a rebounder especially a s foot guy who can also put the ball on the floor and make threes osiah sers shot clock at five working on Tre Fall Away in traffic missed everything and save but nope shot clock violation will be the ticket thatll get us to a break weve been fortunate to see Pat Kelce at different intervals during the season with this first Louisville team of his its its saced to say this I remember Rick patinos first team down the road remember the unforgettables in the early 90s was guy yeah during that time that team remember the one had John pel Richie farmer some other guys on it team is still held in such high esteem it really is I I think the Cardinal team that Pat Kelce has here its going to start out and maybe only get bigger depending on how the next 3 four five teams go here in Louisville well I honestly believe that the next 345 are going to be successful because of the guy that were talking about the difference between is that those guys 35 years ago yeah were here for 4 years thats it good point now youre talking about guys who are wed done and when you consider Chucky H Terence Edwards these guys will only play one season in this uniform so I agree wholeheartly what PK was talking about in at all access point they are the team that is going to bring back the glory to this traditionally historic program but theyre not going to be here long enough to truly see the benefits of it yeah but theyre going to be remembered theres the driving bucket for Blakes whos now got five and you cannot every time youre around the program the number number one thing you come away with is the energy is so big but thats thats the thats a reflection of your head coach and again weve been around you know many coaches or lets just say thats the word many coaches Y and there are a lot of them that are enthusiastic but not all of them are authentic with Pat Kelce it is authentic energy enthusiasm the reason why they have doubled the wind production over the last two seasons is because of this man right here and what he has brought to this community y to this University the stability but more importantly its important to him each and every day which means to his players it has to be important otherwise you cant play for him yeah its uh its impressive to watch its been fun to watch too its very very fun to watch Im telling you comeing you shoot rounds as we see right now get the tip end and making a 10point game you come to shoot around Pat Kel almost has me feeling like I play basketball again and then you remember how sore you are I remember I just had him rep placement 6 months ago here heres Roose on the drive Kai Roose has got a dunk and a layup for his four but give the Cardinal a lot of credit for the way theyve approached the second half theyve scored half the points that they scored only 18 the first half theyve already scored nine here in the second half in the first six plus minutes so playing much better offensively and this guy is starting to get it going WD we talk about the point SC in this second half seven of them are from Reno yep 10 now in the half hes got 14 in the ball game and Maxim starting to find the groove but still a ninepoint lead for number 14 Louisville Hadley knockdown Blakes and scores Javon Hadleys got seven that was nothing but tough right there it really was and went through Blake Blakes trying to get another offensive foul called against the Cardinal unsuccessful three ball agarwall wow second three third three and a half first of the day for Ryan agarwall the sophomore from Capel Texas and now Louisville wants a timeout WD is taking three halves for the Cardinal to get comfortable here but theyve done so in this second half on today Cory largest crowd since February of 2020 and the fourth largest crowd in the last six years here today at the KFC Young Center and they get a dunk from Scott off the Edwards feed the great adjustments by Pat Kelce recognizing his team on the wrong side of momentum here on their home floor and get the building right back into it and a three ball from Reno bound short and out of bounds on the air ball markk snner Maxine r no having a little conversation on the way Applause Music back and in this particular setup we get to see Edwards handled the ball and this is kind of what you were talking about earlier he on the bench and now all of a sudden this guy with comes the primary guy and heres an outlet off the Miss oh thats a tough pass and sellers tried to save it threw it away missed Opportunity by the Cardinal he tough trying to surprise me with anything Duke for lated yeah Im in double figures with the Blue Devils this year double figures Louisville by 10 Cardinals with the ball out of the time out tror has stayed on the floor he got Scott out of the lineup during the break I think or no it was uh beg part tling out of the lineup and theres Terence Edwards to work and just like that after the Cardinal got it to an eightpoint game a 0 run by Louisville to be able to push it back out to 13 Terence Edwards now in double figures has had a great shooting game but a big three on that end dealer cant get through it and now Reno left open another three away treor the rebound and here is the straw that stir the drink heern oh Chucky going back to the basket little post match between the two smallest guys on the floor tror between Thompson and Reno Watermans Applause three I really love what the Cardinals have gotten from Waterman over the last two games no rain Smith on the floor Waterman of course doesnt provide that type of offense but he is a capable threepoint shooter his second of the game today but more importantly what he does on the defensive end of the floor helps his team win game well Terrence Edwards we know about especially after the 35 the other night will step away three on Thompson but if Smith is a the aim or two maybe further from Health Watermans presence becomes more important and this is a better defensive team with Waterman on the floor when you really think about and again I love R Smith and what he brings to this team but he doesnt bring the defensive intensity the size that you see from Waterman on that defensive end eight nothing run the last 2 minutes for the bille dont forget Championship Sunday tomorrow the womens game day crew will be in Greenville at the SEC Championship at a noon start Eastern 900 am Pacific get you ready for six Title Games highlighted by three of them on ESPN The Ally ACC Championship from Greensboro starts at one followed by the SEC and then the Philips 66 Big 12 title follows that its all Championship womens Hoops on Sunday afternoon on ESPN champ week presented for you by principal great mixup by Pat Kelce going full court 94t pressure forcing Maxine REO to have to run 60 ft to get the basketball inbound throwing the Cardinal a little bit off guard on this possession chisaka into traffic working against Waterman bullies his way up ball got knocked away akara cleans it up keer a three and the rebound agell and then he turns it over almost out of the double team hell bounce it to geler hell race Baseline and draw the foul on Edwards my goodness what a Fray that that was a tremendous defensive possession by Louisville except for they didnt finish the possession they gave up the offense rebound right and which has been something that over the last couple of games theyve been susceptible to is offensive rebounding already double figures 11 offensive rebounds now for Stanford and this is an area of concern for Pat Kelce because for all that they do so well yep once you start playing against the competition that youre going to face in the ACC tournament and the NCAA tournament here we go you cant afford to go double figure offensive rebounding which theyve done in the last last two games 13 to Cal and now 11 here tonight geler a former walkon who was given a scholarship by Kyle Smith knocks down both free Applause throws and its all of a sudden a 14point game thats how smart you got to be to be a walk on at Stanford you got to get in that is true you got you first off I mean and not that they dont have tremendous academic requirement for the athletes but there may be some exceptions there but when you get in on your own Merit and then come play basketball come on man under 10 to go Louisville by 14 trying to take a n game win streak to the postseason trayor Baseline quickly Waterman shot fake on Ray no took the bump continuation will be waved off crowd was hoping it would have been waved off and then there have been booze and wman could have actually made need it three free throws if he would have just taken the contact with R in air but that would have hurt a lot worse for the record been there done that well never do it again first foul on Reno is the third on Stanford here in the half and Roger SS is offering a spot on the Baseline for Chucky Hein to put it in Play heres trayor working against dealer abubacar is a terrific athlete in traffic plays a lot bigger than the 65 would list eight to shoot heres Edwards tried to go behind the back agarwall commits the foul first on Ryan agal agarwall its his its the fourth on Stanford and here comes Ruth and Hadley back for Waterman and trior so Kadir sits down I love the conversation right now Maxine r no Roger a is having a talk raino walks away from it smiling normally the way I walk away from my conversation with Roger a uhoh Heburn couldnt finish it got the rebound back Edward splits challenges Reno foul second at this end of the floor of Maxim fifth on Stanford and Terrence Edwards is going to go to the line you see the look at this last time making more free throws than opponent attempts was 197475 7475 was a good year wutd I was one well hang on real quick let me remind folks about UFC 313 tonight in Vegas highlighted by the light heavyweight title fight and Justin Gates returned to the Octagon prelim start at 8 on ESPN news and ESPN Plus in English and Spanish main card at 10 Eastern on payperview to get the main card go to ESPN pluscom ppv 75 by the way Louisville lost in the national championship game in San Diego to John Wooden in his final game as the Brewing head coach and you were born and that was no I was born in 73 I was one that during that time but was that Walton that was wons last game was in the Greensboro Coliseum 1974 semifinal loss to NC State I knew NC State most likely the greatest ACC player of all time knocked away akara heres the lble turnover Chism to the basket against Roose couldnt finish agall does chisms played with great energy but hes had a hard time finishing with those opportunities right around the rim but another offensive rebound allow ows the Cardinal to get Second Chance points eight and a half to go Louisville by 14 Scott back on the floor little ball screen for Edwards heres Hadley on the catch double teamed immediately yep peer three to shoot runs it up there against camon leaking out is oara and hell finish that time and just like that the Cardinal back within 12 this second half has been all about runs and now Stanford answering with another one with a stop here and an opportunity to get it back to 10 you got PE Hadley and Edwards with the ball on the floor Javon on agarwall had it ripped away camon heres oara again hes got sellers with him Chism on the drive and back to back field goals for the big man from Bronxville New York AAR must have heard me talking about him struggling to finish cuz hes finished off the last two possessions I was concerned as to whether he would even take that second one but does and it has success making it a 10point game Pat Kelce gets Chucky heper to slow things down here 10point lead for the number 14 team in the country six to shoot for Terrence Edwards against sers into traffic he goes and puts it up rebound agarwall a bucket here Cory and osiah sers has been quiet after eight in the first half hes scoreless in the second half 6 nothing Stanford run and the they made that run without Maxine Renault on the floor heres sers twopointer nope back room Miss Roose slapped it out tapped away Edwards against Blakes scores ter Edward a dozen for Terence Edwards Jr but its also annoying The Scouting Report you know jayen Blakes is trying to get in position to take a charge great play by Terence Edward Jr to avoid picking up the offense a foul and getting the bucket in transition 12point game again akara squared up from three drives in traffic and foul snur on the whistle and its going to be the third on James Scott five on Louisville and free throws when we come Music back and it should note W Forest leading big against Georgia Tech at halftime in Winston sailor but the case for Georgia Tech if they end up in that eigh spot which they very well could you dont want a bad loss walking into the ACC tournament that could be counterproductive as well yep and the jackets Trail by 20 in the second half at Winston Salem and which Im sure is senior night in Winston Salem however may not be their last game in that building this year right yep a familiar tail is weaving itself again in Winston isnt it it absolutely is which means it could be an nit bid in comparison to an NCAA bid this year heern on the kick Edwards stepped left three ball away nope bouns down and Ruth gives Louisville a second chance Edwards will skip for Waterman thatll spin out R NOA rebound thats a double double the 23rd of the season for Maxine raino which is leading the nation yep Oscar K of South Dakota state is who he was tied with and theres a foul underneath and I think its on Chucky he itll be his third sixth on the vill of course I believe that you know all things so I asked you this question South Dakota state is that the jack rabbits or is it South Dakota no no South Dakota State youre right thats the Jack South Dakota state is the jack rabbit South Dakota is the coyotes ah okay heres Reno at the line 79 on the year and he is now one for three today yeah hasnt been a strong suit in this game and of course its such a crucial Point throughout this at the time of this game you need all those but look at the improvement from Max r no last season he was the pack 12s most improved player this season hes one of the accs best and he is a ticket for first team you can already cash it yeah the question for him is will he be first round because hes absolutely going to play in the association oh my is Simply Now based upon where he gets drafted as many NBA Scouts have shown up today throughout this one to watch Max R know and Kyle Smith going with a 131 Zone defensively throwing the cards a little bit out of Kil Hadley fights through the Baseline and scores but thats the one area youre always going to be exposed get a 131 along that Baseline its a long run for that bottom Defender to try to guard multiple players as the ball changes side boy heern really digging in on agar wall with 440 to play now heres aara against Waterman talk about digging in look at Chism to work with a right hand and scoring I tell you what szs never seen a shot that he didnt like he has been getting his look looks at it three of eight from the field in this one and once he catches it hes got a one trck mine and that time he was successful tell you what he is a truckload of trouble is he from a physical standpoint hakara is 68240 played at Harvard his sister volleyball player at Stanford by the way he averaged 17 and5 a year ago for Tommy Amer hes averaging 6 and two here this year for Kyle Smith you want to talk about sisters jayen Blake sister matao yeah oh yeah terrific player Hadley the n Applause one foul is going to be on osiah cers underneath out of bounds play just puts Hadley in a position to be able to play one onone these two guys of course Hadley coming from Colorado sellers coming from USC theyre familiar with each other both in the pack 12 a season to go and Hadley able to win that battle but misses the chance for a threepoint play he feels like the tough guy bucket yeah yeah thats him yeah Reno slipped the screen and couldnt catch the Bullet Pass from agar wall here is Edwards lobs and boy he threw it to Goan Scott was Scott was the intended receiver but that one got thrown up main stream Street well Hadley senior day man it really is a tougher on senior day but fortunately for them they will be at the ACC tournament and I believe here through at least the first round of the NCAA tournament where the Cardinals will absolutely be participating so most likely rain will be back and they will have an opportunity to see him get back on to the floor and what could be the most meaningful games throughout his college basketball career terrific player Charleston for Pat Kelce hes been a just a really impactful ad here agarwall missed the three Line Drive shot Outlet here is Edwards layup good he snuck around oiah sers for the layup and you know we came in talking about this back court you talk about Chucky heern and of course Terence Edwards Jr two guys who could very well be on the first team all ACC team and we dont talk about Hadley who really has been the guy for the cards especially here in this second half making play on both ends of the floor and providing that energy and effort Reno right hand scores boy Maxim Reno there so much fun to watch thats 15 11 now on his actually 17 11 on his six field goal but every time he catches the basketball he sees red jerseys all around him the Cardinal trying Cardinals trying to force him to kick it out and make someone else beat them Blakes defending he Hadley against agarwall Applause for to shoot Chucky lobs for Scott thats is kemist great connection James Scott knows whenever Chucky has the basketball to be prepared to go up top because his point guard will absolutely delivered Louisville by 14 and a foul Music called and we got Reno and chck tossing it up Scott with the finish one of the reasons why hes second nationally in dunks over 70 now as trayor and Max R know have a little conversation and it really was tayori who took exception Reno got the call and just walked away tayori had something to say to him of course Pat Kelce loves the effort from trayor as you mentioned plays much larger than his 65 stature REO at the line 21 years of age from Paris and missed the front end of the one and one cards front court with two minutes to Applause go Scott for Edwards Stanford really extending the pressure here defensively yeah give r no a lot of credit he got after it on that possession defensively guarding multiple players stepping out hedging the screen and roll and then eventually switching Cory he showed us a lot today in a losing effort I think but nonetheless hes shown us a lot he really has and again youve been fortunate to watch him a number of times live throughout this year hes shown me something different each and every time just like on that defensive possession this the first time Ive seen that type of effort on the defensive end of the floor 95 seconds to go Louisville by 14 heurn with one on the shot clock how about that you couldnt have asked for a better offensive possession by Chucky heurn keep it waste as much time as possible and then of course go with the Highlight level finish at the end of the shot clock minute to go in the crowd the largest theyve had here in five years in change loves it Im shocked that Pat Kels actually not going to get these guys off the floor maybe he will with the foul maybe he will but give each and every one of these guys who are playing their last game and heurn and Edwards as well as Hadley give them an opportunity for this tremendous crowd here at KFC y center to applaud them hell shoot the one and one so heres heurn and he made the front end and thats exactly whats going to happen now theyre going to get well this may be a substitution for Scott Here Comes amsam eBay for James Applause Scott and abbar trior will come back to replace jav Hadley Javon Hadley there you go and Roose I think is next oh he stays on the bench heon knocks down the free throw Chucky with four and a half 16 in the game Louisville by 18 points we under a minute to go and geler being hounded by Applause heurn healer in a double team and trying to cash out dust to C and Coach Kelsey asking them to foul one did they foul in that possession well call the timeout now and roll it to get their subs onto the floor yep so Kai Roose is going to come in and I think Chucky heern is going to get the curtain call here he replaces number 24 and a long kiss for the cardinal here for the Cs number 33 a m and Terrence Edwards is going to get a curtain call Terence Edward J tell you those two guys alongside rain Smith and Hatley will get a tremendous amount of credit replacing no as well as Waterman for bringing the cards back yep and for those who are not Believers there hasnt been a tremendous amount of national attention but the cards are absolutely back and trior will be the last off the floor and heres Spencer leg in his 26th career game and hell get anel eBay so those that are available now have all come off the floor for Louisville and each and every one of those guys will be celebrated in a ceremony after the game and Baseline Roose missed the dunk and canile save it Sherman a three how about it Sherman first field goal of the year for Cole Sherman and oara fouled going to the basket with 123 to go and akara by attacking and getting fouled gives the cards another opportunity to get someone a shot you love to see guys who have put in the hard work the Blood Sweat and Tears to support a program get the opportunity to come in late game on their senior night and knock down a three ball hakara got the roll on the second one heres Patrick Antonelli into the front Court working against oara 3 2 1 6848 the final Pat Kel team goes to 25 and6 and they finish the ACC at 182 Stanford goes regular season 19
