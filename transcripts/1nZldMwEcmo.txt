struggling as they begin the ACC calendar yet again but well see how they look coming out today in desperate need of a win Toby Lal against Lin kid and the opening tip won by the hokes Virginia Tech will start with the basketball theyve got a young group of guards with Ben Hammond at the top now Jaden shoot for three and drills it to start it out a great start for the hokes great execution on that first set coming out against the m and Jaden shoot when he gets his feet set and he has an inch of daylight its got a great chance of going down good start for the hokes take a look at the starting five for Miami which has changed a lot throughout the season due to some injuries Nigel pack remains out for the hurricanes with a left foot injury so Jalil Bea is in there to start today now Brandon Johnson underneath and at the end of the shot clock puts it off the window an interesting see Miami right away going to Brandon Johnson on the Block and talking to coach Bill Courtney earlier today he said we got to get him going you see right away first possession getting into him able to score now bti against kid Ben Hammond at the top Jaden Shu thought about another three but guarded tightly by the senior Applause Cleveland seven to shoot for Virginia Tech Ben Hammond throws it inside potit has it blocked one on the shot clock and now a foul is called as potit goes up right at the end of the clock foul will go on LY kid that is his first and a reaction from the crowd and a great pass potit rolling to the basket anytime youre going against this Virginia Tech Team you got to be able to guard a lot of movement they are never standing still great job on the roll po going to the free throw line try to get on the scoreboard here early Migel potit missing on the first free throw but averaging almost 10 points per game and a little over four rebounds as you take a look at Mike young in season number six as Virginia Techs head coach and closing in on 100 career victories here in blackburg it was interesting talking to Mike young earlier today at their shoot around asked him have you had to show more patience than you normally would because of how young your team is they start two true freshman which is almost unheard of in college basketball these days with the transfer portal and being able to go get experienced players to start two true freshman is unbelievable and we see Matthew Cleveland getting a friendly roll on the road but Mike young showing a lot of patience with this team but he likes where theyre headed he likes the direction theyre going theyre getting better each day just going to be a work in progress all year long searching for their first ACC win 58 overall 0 and2 in conference play nice pass Hammond finding poti and again the movement player movement ball movement the ball never stops when it reaches the hands of one player everybody is always moving it yous got to have your head on a swivel the whole time and a great feed that time to PO peal for the dunk Jalil Betha misses the three and now Hammond back across the floor for Virginia Tech one of those two true freshmen that David referenced Jaden shot passed up the three Now Toby lall pass it up himself a wall has that one blocked and now Divine uguk Wu down the floor and Cleveland trying to find his way to the bucket and does and that was a great catch by Matthew Cleveland on full Sprint was able to gather himself gave a couple shot Bas kind of let the defense fly by a good finish and and thats what Miami wants to look to do they want to look to get out on the break after clean stops try to get the pace going up and down a little bit more heres Jaden shoot from the wing drills another three miscommunication there that time between Paul Jo Bay and Matthew Cleveland on who was supposed to take shoe coming off of that down screen and out of the gates early for Jaden shoot two threes good sign for Mike Youngs team shot came into the game 29 threes now with 30 and 31 to start this one in the first four minutes and now Brandon Johnson a three Ben Hammond grabs the rebound all 511 of them a wow down low potit slams it home that has been the issue for Miami this year they are a very good and very capable offensive team they have just had their struggles on the defensive end just not able to make sure all five guys are connected all at the same time right way early on Virginia Tech exposing those weaknesses and now Johnson fouled by potit and gets the bucket to go Brandon Johnson a chance for three David the East Carolina transfer and you see right away the offense just an empty side ball screen good shot bacon as soon as you get the defender that time Elijah potit up in the air good job drawing the contact and even better job finishing chance for the threepoint play Brandon Johnson 71 from the free throw line to start the year and connects Miami going with a little one two2 full court pressure here after the free throw see if they can create an easy turnover Virginia Tech worked hard going against us today and shoot around Tyler Johnson off the feed No Patrick wesler will clean it up talking to Mike young today he said Patrick Wester is the guy that has been playing more consistent basketball than anybody else doesnt start but you can see right way coming off the bench able to contribute early on Paul Joe Bay lost the handle on it had it tapped by wesler and a turnover to the hokes Hammond looking for a screen from wesler in the corner Tyler Johnson finds the twine for three that was a great extra pass by Jaden Shu Jaden Shu had a decent shot but Tyler Johnson had a great shot almost a hockey assist type pass it doesnt show up in the stat sheet but for Mike young you got to love to see the unselfishness right away out of this start of this game good start for Virginia Tech today here at home a 103 Run for the hokes and now Joe Bay off the glass and in that was a tough finish a lot of contact down there but Jo B able to finish with that left hand and Miami finding a way to hang in there offensively but got to figure out a way to get some stops here on the defensive end Patrick wesler coming off a 10point performance against Duke in a loss earlier this week that pass a little too high for him and a turnover to the Hurricanes Divine UGA chuku setting up the offense finds Johnson underneath what a great pass by Divine ugat chuku Brandon Johnson with a great back cut he was initially going to come set a ball screen but that was a needle ugugu had to thread and he did it for the great finish by Johnson westler tried to go down low to shoot and its out of bounds off of Jadens fingertips and it brings us to our first timeout entertaining start for J A hurricanes team that is admittedly in some transition with Bill taking over in the interim role and David padet you were once an interim coach so you can relate to what Bill Courtneys going through I certainly can and it was really interesting talking to him today about that now the timing was a little bit different he took over in the middle of the season so practice and games are obviously fully underway see a great move there by Ben Burnham but youre basically drinking out of a fire hose youre just trying to figure out what to do on the fly now Bill Courtney was head coach at Cornell for six years so obviously hes been in that seat before which certainly helps but you got to find a way to make the players rally together I asked him I said what was the reaction of the players and he said initially just shocked like everybody was you just dont expect something like that to happen right around Christmas time but nonetheless theyve done a very good job of rallying only their second game together didnt win on the road the other day at Boston College but in that first half may have played their best half of basketball of the season so theyre still trying to figure it all out put it together but they are Full Speed Ahead on what they need to do to try to win some games in the ACC Jaden shoot a good look on a three in the Miss and then Paul Joe Bay Coast to Coast for the bucket and that is Paul Joe Bs game right there he is is a downhill attacking the rim kind of player and you see in transition when he gets a full head of steam he is almost Unstoppable Miami seven of their eight field goals have come in the paint to start this game Ben Burnham going against Joe Bay and now Johnson a baseline jumper and bailed out with a foul he never want a foul a jump shooter pretty good defense there that time just got a little bit too much of the hand on the jump shot Paul Joe Bay picking up his first personal foul both of these teams shooting the ball well to start the game Miami 8 of 11 and Virginia Tech 7even of 11 as Tyler Johnson the true freshman out of Orlando at the free throw line and knocks down the first heres next Saturdays ACC Network mens basketball triple header Clemson hosts Florida State at little John to start off two Eastern then North Carolina and NC State square off and Raleigh and finally Virginia Tech takes on Cal should be a great afternoon and evening of Hoops on the ACC Network Tyler Johnson knocking him down to give Virginia Tech the twopoint Advantage talking about the coaching change with Jim Lena retiring and Bill Courtney stepping in that coincides of course with Miami playing without Nigel pack a first team all ACC player in the preseason so theres just so much transition for this hurricane team at this point in the year as Joe Bay turns it over with his foot on the Baseline and it will bring us to a Timeout on the floor coaching in this one usually is a tight game between Miami and Virginia Tech figure to have another one here today now ly kid the steel but it comes back to the back court and Rod Brown Jr has it 12 to shoot for the hokes Ben Burnham a three from the wing thats good kind of a desperation type three I know there were still about 10 seconds left there on the shot clock but Ben Burnham is a very good threepoint shooter shooting 44 so far this season so hes one of those guys especially late clock like that you got to know make him put the ball on the floor and try to make a play off the dribble that one goes off the leg and a turnover to Virginia Tech Ben Burnham the senior you see got a clean shave in now sporting the mustache but was at Charleston where he was all CAA third team selection under Pat Kelce who is now in the ACCC at Louisville Jaden shoot off on the three a little bit of contact no call out of bounds to Miami in Miami these last couple of possessions seem like theyve turned up the heat a little bit as far as pressuring the ball even though burnam was was able to knock down that three a couple possessions ago Miami at their best when they are pressuring the ball not letting you run your sets Applause comfortably Austin Schwarz into the game now for Applause Miami along with Jaylen Blackman the Stetson transfer Blackman into the paint with the left hand good you can see the talent level from these guards on Miami that has not been a concern all year long they can absolutely put points on the board averaging almost 80 points a game but again it just comes down to this end right here they just had these wos defensively especially on pick and roll like we just saw right there elel potit got knocked down by two Defenders there for Miami and Jaylen Blackman will pick up the foul thats his first you see just the oneonone ability to get in the Lane Jaylen Blackman just with a good lefthanded finish and thats about the third or fourth time here in this game where Virginia Tech has had Success With The Ball screen malago poti that time just rolling right to the rim and no resistance from the Hurricanes potit missing at the free throw line here elel poti another guy that Virginia Tech has developed well a big man whose numbers have continued to increase now in his grad season began his collegiate career at rice and now has been here at Virginia Tech for several seasons and has continued to get better and better so far here early in this game Virginia Tech has done a very good job of limiting Lynn kid hes only gotten one touch on the Block and another good defensive possession but they worked very hard earlier today in trapping him when he caught the ball and a couple other times malel poe just used his strength to bump him far enough off the block to make him uncomfortable they know that Miamis good when they play through Lin kid and so far Virginia Techs doing a good job of shutting that down kid picked up a foul in the first couple minutes but he has not attempted a shot yet not a rebound yet but thatll change right as we said it he scores Miami is doing a great job in this game when theyve gotten clean stops theyve been able to get out on the break quickly and score and have success in a great pass that time by Jaylen Blackman to kid running the floor and here they come again in transition and that one is good Isaiah Johnson Oru Tech head coach Mike young stressed that significantly today in their shoot get back when the shot goes up because you can see how quickly they change ends of the floor and having some success last few possessions three ball off Target for Jaden young the softmore from Goldsboro North Carolina and now Miami back to work with a little pep in their step offensively kid crosscourt three ball off Target from Austin Schwarz and now Burnham quickly moves the ball down the floor for the hokes and misses Applause underneath Schwartz tries to answer over Burnham scores in the foul six straight points for the Hurricanes that was a big time finish there by Austin Schwartz but again you just see how quickly they change ends they get a clean rebound you see Schwarz with the left hand Little Euro Step and Ben Burnham trying to block it but just unable to get there thats been the problem for Miami this year is theyre so good in transition but because theyve struggled so much defensively at times they havent been able to get out and do so but you can see their best offense might be fast break first lead for Miami since it was 7 to6 Virginia Tech has controlled a lot of the game but the free throw missed one possession game as Virginia Tech brings it back across Brown Jr passed up a three La able to score it and to me Toby LW is a very very good player but his ceiling is extremely high hes is a great athlete hes got great size hes only been playing basketball since he was 16 years old born in London so still very new to the game but you can see the potential he was running track and playing soccer its Toby LA and he said you are an incredible athlete you got a huge vertical leap try basketball I think its working out for you yeah I think you made the right decision no doubt about it Blackman going to work into a double now kicks it out AJ ston McCrae misses a three Johnson had the rebound tipped away from him by Ben Hammond now the Freshman across the floor and laow the alyuk dunk Toby L almost just hit his head on the rip H you done but Virginia Tech when they are locked in on defense as well they can get out on the break in their own right you see Toby low maybe the best athlete on the court showing off right there for the easy Music two now drawing the foul on Jaden young Cooper flag obviously deserves all the recognition he has gotten and continues to receive but for a lot of ACC fans out there if you get a chance to watch Stanford play they have the the second best player in the ACC Maxim R know the 71 center is incredibly talented had a chance to cover their game against Clemson the other day big time player ACC PM with Mark Packer and Taylor tabom weekdays at Fort Eastern right here on acc Network and the ESPN app I know you really like what Max seems been doing at Stanford and you know talking about Duke Mike young and his Virginia Tech Team just played Duke earlier this week they lost 8865 and Mike young saying in his six years covering or Play Rather coaching in the ACC he feels like this may be the best Duke outfit because of their defense and watch that entire game and Virginia Tech played really well hung in there for most of the first half second half just got away from him and again Elijah poti just having his way inside great high low pass there from Toby lewow but Dukes defense and especially at home Cameron indor just turns up to another level but they make it extremely difficult for you to get into anything offensively their pressure on the ball may be the best in the Music country Brandon Johnson now finding Schwarz a long three from the logo in Kaner and Austin Schwartz he has not shot great percentage wise on the season but he is a very good threepoint shooter earlier this year against Tennessee had a a couple threes early in the game that quite frankly kept Miami in it for most of that first half watching him today and shoot around hes got a great looking form and saw that one right there from three or four feet behind the line Jaden shoots got good form as well missing the three there Cleveland the rebound and now Divine Ugo chuku going inside for kid but a foul called against Virginia Tech Austin Schwartz has great size so he has the ability to shoot over has a quick release but you see thats NBA range maybe even a little bit further hes got great release on it great rotation on the ball and we asked Bill Courtney today is your team a better shooting team than the numbers would indicate he says yes he says when we take good shots we shoot a very good percentage theres just been times this year where they just havent taken great shots and its hurt them numbers wise because of it Schwartz is just a 21 threepoint shooter early on but certainly didnt look like it well you see that form right there I mean thats thats the not the form of a 21 threepoint shooter again it just comes back to shot selection theres theres such a fine line in college basketball between a good shot and a great shot and when you take great ones the numbers are going to go up well the last couple possessions Jaden shot has picked up two personal fouls for Virginia Tech so he now goes to the bench made a couple of Threes early well see how that affects the the hokes 5 and 12 minutes to go here in the first half kned at 30 Matthew Cleveland to three and the rebound to Applause hammer Brown Jr now and La going to work against Johnson Oru potit left open and hits the jumper nice touch there from malel potit normally not shooting anywhere outside of six or eight feet but that time looked very comfor like well we well dare you to shoot that ball he said fine okay Ill just make it well the worst thing you can do when youre left open like that is to hesitate and think about it in a tough midrange jump shot there by Jalil Betha but when youre left that open if you hesitate youre definitely not going to make it but he caught that one stride and knocked it down Elijah bowti 10 points in the first half for the hokes now brown Jor into the paint no rebounded ly kid better transition defense that time from Virginia Tech got back built a wall and stopped the Applause ball T to shoot for Ugo chuku in the corner Bea for three Bill Courtney said were going to put Jalil in the starting line of today to see if we can get him going and McDonalds AllAmerican coming out of Philadelphia was the top 10 recruit the highest recruit Miami has ever signed coming out of high school so you can see the talent he spent a lot of time today ironically enough in the corners that shoot round shooting threes with one of the assistant coaches certainly paid off yeah rated the number 10 recruit out of high school by ESPN 82 run for the Hurricanes who are up three on crosscourt pass a dangerous one Miami keeps it and Cleveland drills from the top of the cage good patience there from Miami knocking down another three and all of a sudden Miami with their biggest lead of the game a lot of unselfish play here on both ends guys making the extra pass the highly touted freshman Jalil Betha in the leftand corner knocking down a big three and the next possession Matt Cleveland their goto scorer knocking it down sixpoint lead here for the case Music Music Music all right thank you Taylor and here in blackburg it is Miami 38 and Virginia Tech 32 319 to go here in the first half of Play an8 Nothing Run for the Hurricanes going into the timeout so well see what Mike young has drawn up for the hokes try to gain some of the momentum back near turnover by brown but able to keep Miami is shooting 67 from the field theyre four of 11 from three but theyre 12 of 13 from two theyve missed one twopoint shot so far in this game Ben Hammond with his first bucket of the game well theyve dominated in the paint all first half long David and just gotten so many high percentage buckets in this first 20 minutes and now beo the Miss underneath a rebound by Johnson and a kick out to Cleveland down the lane contact no itll go to the line and Virginia Tech bench not very happy with that call and I dont blame him that looked like pretty good verticality to me by Rodney Brown Jr he left his feet went straight up in the air didnt break his plane good shot fake there by Matthew Cleveland excuse me Toby lewall yeah thats not a foul that that they missed that call he they changed that rule a couple of years ago and I guess the ball doesnt lie right just like the old saying you can leave your feet and make contact with the offensive player as long as you stay in your plane and stay vertical with your hands and he did both in that situation so nonetheless Miami with one point there on the free throw but pretty good defense there by Virginia Tech Brown Jr going to work trying to get between two Defenders turns around hands off to laow and he puts it in off the glass it was interesting talking to Bill Courtney today just to see what his answer was going to be because I had thought the same thing before I asked him what has been the biggest difference this year defensively for you guys because in years past Jim Blair and egas teams have always been very very good defensively near turnover there for the cans and he said we dont have any Rim protection he goes we just dont have a good shot Blocker on this team and it has hurt him so far this season you saw that on that last Applause possession Isaiah Johnson Oro picking up the personal foul itll turn the ball back over to Virginia Tech down by three with 146 to go here in the half you see Bill Courtney trying to situate his team defensively we talked about the bigs going into this matchup today with Lyn kid against Migel potit so far potit 10 first half points kid only has two and again you see one game just the simple ball screen coverage its just a high pick and roll in the middle Toby Lo just rolled right to the rim and theres just no protection back there yeah they just have really really struggled the Miami Hurricanes have to defend the ball screen here in this first half now Virginia three of its last three from the field and a turn over by the Hurricanes Bea had that one just go off the leg of Mike young knows is the kinds of turnovers as a coach that just make you want to scratch your eyes out I mean just so frustrating just careless turnover I mean lose focus for a half a second all of a sudden Virginia Techs got the ball going the other way here with a chance to take the lead Hammond taking the screen from laal and he feeds it for the alley slam that was gorgeous a great pass there by Ben Hammond but again the ball screen coverage Virginia Tech is not doing anything complicated theyre just setting a high middle ball screen with Toby L hes rolling right to the rim theres just no resistance from anybody in Black when you throw it up there to the wild like that he is going to go get it now a onepoint lead for the hokes theyve scored six straight Cleveland off Target about a three and 12 second difference between the shot and the game clock and the hokes can work it Applause down I have a feeling toobe the wild is going to come up here for another high ball screen in the middle until Miami proves that they can stop it why not keep going back to it 8 seconds to shoot now Hammonds got to work Hammond finding Lal trying to get through and draws the foul with 66 seconds left in the half Virginia Tech just having a lot of success Ben Hammond coming off and Ls doing a great job of rolling hard hes not hesitating hes not waiting but on the back side of the defense theres nobody in the lane the further you are away from the ball the further you have to come over to help because youre not worried about the skip pass right now theyre having success throwing the ball to the rim so stop that first and then adjust if they start making a skip pass to the other Corner the while as a 492 inch vertical leap how do you stop that you dont and I would have taken y over on that based on a couple of dunks hes had so far now in the corner Johnson for three no two seconds 1 second ston McCrae at the buzzer no and that ends the first half with Virginia Tech on top by one six straight points ends the half very good close first half Toby Lal is the player that Mike young said is the most athletic guy that he has ever coached weve certainly seen that in the first 20 minutes and what a start for Miami as Jalil Betha drills a three yeah good design there by Bill Courtney coming out of the locker room Jalil Bia had hit a three from that exact same corner just on the other end of the floor in the first half and again trying to get him going like he said this morning and a good start for the canes Migel poti missing there rebound by Linn kid and Miami quickly back across the floor and ly kid with a very quiet first half but give Virginia Tech Credit they were not going to allow him to get going offensively kid just two points and three rebounds and now a turnover to the hokes Ben Hammond for three one of the best times in basketball to shoot a three is in transition Miami did a good job initially of stopping the ball but Ben Hammond just able to step into that one and knock it down and both teams picking up offensively right where they left off in that first half so the Hokey seesaw back into the lead Music kid working against his buddy poti gets around him and now the skip pass Johnson with five to shoot and a blocking foul is called and I think that was a good call Ben Hammond tried to take the offensive foul but that was a big point of emphasis in the off season as the officials decide whether or not that basket should count but as the primary Defender unless you are directly in front of the ball handler thats going to be called a block every time even though Brandon Johnson obviously initiated the contact and I think thats why the fans were upset that was a big point of emphasis its become much harder in college basketball to take a charge and create an offense of foul great inbounds pass from UGA chuku and Cleveland slams it home good execution there Virginia Tech worked pretty hard today on their underneath that abounds defense their coaching staff not going to be very happy with that defense right there good cut to the basket from Matthew Cleveland whos got 12 points in this one theres a block by Johnson on potit Johnson trying to get down the lane missing there tipped around and it comes out to Hammond ni pass and laal is fouled by ly kid Ben Hammond when he gets the ball in the open court he is really really fast change ends quick right there good job by Toby low he has tremendous Vision yeah running the floor Toby low got rewarded there but hymon did a good job right there he didnt force the issue he could have tried to go in and score that himself he didnt showed good patience there for a true freshman rewarded his teammate whos going to the free throw line our next ACC Network womens basketball quadruple headers tomorrow were looking ahead at next Sundays four games featuring three top 20 teams number 14 Duke Tak taking on Virginia noon Eastern then 17th ranked North Carolina hosts PC followed by number 13 Georgia Tech and Louisville will cap the day Miami and Syracuse and wow gets them both go chuku knives through the defense feeds it up there for Ken the bucket and a foul Miami given Virginia Tech a little taste of their own medicine there with just a double drag high ball screen Divine uuku actually split the screens rejected the second one and got in the lane and broke that defense down you see right there was supposed to come off the second screen but didnt and a good lob pass to Lyn Kidd and not a whole lot of contact there but the officials saw enough ly kid trying to get going and these fans let him know theyre not real happy with his decision to leave here last year L picking up the foul as kid completes the threepoint play just talking to Lyn kid before the game who was it is it weird to come back here and he really felt like it wasnt he said I have great memories playing here like my teammates a lot have great friendships but good to be back and now UGA chukwu throws down the dunk off the turnover that is one thing thats really frustrated Mike young this year is just the inability to take care of the basketball normally his teams have a fantastic assist turnover ratio and this year they actually have a negative one something he is not accustomed to poti got the friendly roll thats sort of one of the mantras of Mike young programs right we dont turn the ball over unfortunately that has been an issue for the hokes again Miami going back to that double drag high ball screen Hugo chuku high off the window and a great finish there Migel potit came over and tried to give some resistance on that but UGA Chuka with a nice high finish off the backboard and Miami will run here to take a fourpoint lead early in this second Music half and shoot nearly turned it over Cleveland tapped it back to him and now potit underneath gets the feet from Lal for the bucket and Virginia Tech has had success with that Jaden Shu came off the handoff meijel potite rolled to the basket the high low pass the top is not open but if they throw it back to the wing because Miami is fronting Migel potit theyve been able to throw it over the top great pass and finish there for the hokes kid whips it across the floor and Cleveland leaps to catch it seven to shoot Cleveland backing down Johnson misses underneath Hammond down the floor and Lal able to tip it back shoot wide open misses the three Johnson able to grab it somehow shos going to try again buries it Jaden shoot is way too good of a threepoint shooter to miss two in a row that wide open the best time to shoot a three off of an offensive rebound this crowd trying to get in the game Jaden shoots hit three threes today nine points and now Bea from way out on the tea of Virginia Tech goodness Miami Hurricanes are at their best when they are creating easy Steals and getting out on the fast break the deflection good pass ahead Divine uku with the easy two but on the other end Jaden shoot off the offensive rebound knocking down the three we got a good one here in blackburg Music Hugo chukwu whos certainly made his presence felt over the last few minutes four points now for Miami hes worked his way into the starting lineup for the Miami Hurricanes after Nigel Packs injury as Lal throws down the dunk off of the Miss from Jaden shoot Divine uko chuku was discovered by Miami because Jim Lenas son Jay knew Hakeem elijuan uko chuku played high school basketball with elijahwan sons do you know that hakee elijuan is working with NBA players on their footwork and when Jay Lena was an assistant for the Celtics he got to know Hakeem because he was bringing Jason Tatum there to work on footwork and hakee was like hey I got this guy your dad should look at him to come play at Miami and now Divine Ugo chuku not only at Miami but starting because Nigel pack is out the initial thought was maybe a red shirt but hes made a big impact on the hurricane so far he absolutely has and has had a good productive day so far here today and its kind of been by committee stepping in for Nigel pack but you see this recruiting class the landscape of college basketball this day and age pretty rare to see such a big freshman recruiting class but such a talented one as well still trying to figure out how to put all the pieces together and now Brandon Johnson in the paint drawing the foul if youre a basketball player and you want to learn about footwork theres nobody better on the face of this Earth than aim alijan right I mean well I didnt know that thats what he was doing but it makes absolute perfect sense that elijahwan is working with NBA stars on their footwork Jim Lena son Jay has worked in the NBA its several stops as an assistant coach with the Clippers with the Celtics a small world of basketball right everybodys connected thats how you find these guys get Applause opportunities Johnson second free throw good full CT pressure here from Miami theyve shown this after every free throw so far here today just little two21 just to kind of slow down the offense try to eat up some clock in the back court Brandon Rex Steiner into the game now for the hokes Burnham wanting to throw it down low but cant Blackman on him heres Brown Jr a three no and the rebound to Jaylen Blackman the senior from Maran Indiana well neither Toby l or malel potit on the floor right now for Virginia Tech so wheres Mike young going to turn offensively to try to get some points be curious to see how long those two sit over there together on that bench they have been absolutely Unstoppable inside for the hes today and Patrick wesler picking up the foul wesler has been a real nice find Off the Bench for the hokes the red shirt sophomore 10 points against Duke earlier this week Joe Bay at the free throw line knocks down the first Music Paul Joe Bay the 14th ranked Prospect out of Florida in the ESPN couple of years ago hails from France fourpoint Miami Lee and something to keep an eye on here in the second half Miami has been a pretty good defensive team this season in the first half theyve really struggled in the second half and I talked to Bill Courtney today about that said what do you think that is attributed to he said in the second half our players dont have our coaches voices down at the other end of see great patience there Patrick wesler but it does make a big difference in the first half youre on defense in front of your own bench so your coaches can help point out what youre supposed to be doing they can almost talk for you but in the second half especially on the road its much more difficult and they havent done a great job of that so far this season Cleveland knocks down the three off a good pass from Johnson Inside Out basketball Brandon Johnson great job not forcing the issue caught it on the Block didnt have it kicked it out to Matthew Cleveland who knocked down the three and Miami with a fivepoint lead here little momentum in the second half not something theyve had a whole lot of times this season Rex Steiner from the wing thats true Brandon Rex Steiners first basket of the game back to a twopoint game David Virginia Tech has got several guards that are young but very talented and you just in this day and age of nil in the portal its hard to keep guys together but it feels like there is a nucleus here that if Virginia Tech could keep these guys together which I know is saying a lot this can be a really good team we talked about it in the first half the patience Mike young has had to show this season and theyve played a difficult ult schedule too they played Penn State they played Michigan South Carolina Vanderbilt thats before even getting into conference play but two two freshman two true freshman excuse me Ben Hammond and Tyler Johnson and even though Jaden shoots been in college for this is his third year now he hasnt played because of injury so from an on court standpoint hes inexperienced as well but youre right if they keep these guys together theyre getting better but just takes time Jaylen Blackman the step back jumper Miami back up four neither team has led by more than six points in this game good back and forth for about 28 minutes and theres a turnover by Rex Steiner one one of those turnovers that Mike young has just really been frustrated with this season and Schwartz makes him pay with a three you can just see the bench over there from Miami they are just somehow trying to find a way to will themselves to a victory here great block there by Matthew Cleveland and a great Outlet pass and that one out of bounds itll stay with Miami four from Beyond The Ark one of the reasons why Miami has been able to build the sevenpoint lead their largest of the game Lan kid in the post and against a double loses the handle Rex Steiner knocked it away to Burnham and Virginia Tech continuing to trap Lyn kid when he catches the ball that time tried to do the right thing and dribble out of it to make the pass but good hands there by Brandon Applause Reiner shoot down low to poti and he cant get it to go and now a late whistle and a foul coming up against Miami very late indeed thats one of those lets wait and see if it goes in if it doesnt well blow our whistle and they were basically moving down the other side of the court and they get Betha for the foul but again the success on the pick and roll Elijah potit just rolling and yes some contact but you see they had possession of the ball before the whistle was even blown Elijah potit knocks down the free throw thats why Bill Courtney was so upset potit today now 16 points to Brad senior from Reedsville North Carolina Toby L still sitting over there on the bench for Virginia Tech I have a feeling wont be for a whole lot longer get him his last rest dont think hes going to be coming out rest of this game Joe Bay cant get it to go in traffic against Burnham who played some good defense and now Burnham on the other end misses the three back tap to Rex Steiner Betha the near steel and jumped up on the scorer table he made that look pretty effortless I think when the games over were going to have you go out there in your suit and try to do that I will get injured you can have me try it will not end well oh you can do this I now now stay on balance as well I would have fallen right over the table and taken out all those people right there five to shoot now a turnover heres Schwartz down the lane with the right puts it in that was a good finish I didnt think he had much there but Austin Schwarz with the little reverse nice spin off the glass and been really impressed today with how good Miami is when they get out in the break just so good at finishing but again that has been their Achilles seal in this basketball game there is just a complete breakdown defensively Lyn kid is blitzing or hedging the ball screen at 2530 ft you got to give him time to recover somebody has to come help his man whos just rolling right to the Rim Yeah petits career high is 19 hes at 18 right now hes seven of 11 from the field you have to think too not that theyre necessarily going up against each other but the fact that ly kid is on the other side potit was going to come out with a big effort today Blackman along the Baseline taken away by burnam that right there is why you dont reject the ball screen and try to go Baseline youre driving into No Mans Land had to pick up his dribble and good job by Burnham anticipating and making the steal a brown trying to get to the paint kick out Hammond along the Baseline into a double himself and the same thing happens on the other end theres an old saying good things happen when you drive middle bad things happen when you drive Baseline and now foul is Applause called looks like the officials are trying to decide if there was going to be a travel first I thought ly kid well the hes are saying its a travel yeah but he did the initial signal from the official was a foul yeah they are calling the foul looks like on Burnham excuse me itll be l a good job running yeah Lin kid definitely got away with that travel there his back pit foot that pivot foot slid across the floor officials didnt see it they switched it to Ben Hammond so Hammond now there it was burn check so Ben Burnham picking up the foul and now Miami will inbound underneath its own hoop Schwartz got brown in the air and now hits the long jumper thats a two for Austin Schwarz and a great shot fake there was able to take that little side dribble got himself balanced and when he gets his feet set and is squared to the basket he is a terrific shooter hes got great Applause form the while spinning into a double team in a foul call theres an old thing in basketball called a make up call sometimes not saying there wasnt contact there but that was going to be a foul one way or another I think cuz the officials know they may have missed that travel but good move there by Toby low going strong you see that aggressiveness and that athleticism when he puts his head down and gets to the rim he is really hard to stop so Johnson the foul L goes to the line and Toby knocks down the first tonight 8 Eastern after our basketball triple header right here on acc Network and the ESPN app the nothing but net crew will break down the day in the ACC highlights analysis of every mens game look ahead to the best matchups on the schedule in the coming week and now a timeout taken by Virginia Tech with 841 to go fivepoint Miami lead on the road Lyn kids had a quiet game and right on Q he scores off the offensive rebound yeah but they made it a focal point to try to shut him down not because he used to play or anything like that because hes one of Miamis best players if not the the best player so from a scouting standpoint that was the Focal Point Virginia Techs done a very good job of that they have theyve slowed him down Lyn kid averaging about 11 and a half points per game and over seven rebounds which leads The KES and now brown kicks it out to Burnham who spins into the paint with 4 seconds to shoot misses there and kid there for the rebound Miami had success with this high ball screen this little double drag with Divine UGA chuku coming off to his right hand and they went back to it again that time great read by Ben Hammond and off the steel there he goes down the floor trying to hand it to L but a little bit too strong on the pass and its turned over to Miami opportunity missed there for Virginia Tech who Trails by seven with coming in at 0 and2 in League Play frankly both of these teams just need a win and I think weve seen that desperation from both sides in this one David talking to Bill Courtney today he said we just need our guys to just have some success yeah because theyre doing everything were asking them to do the effort has been there they just need to have a little bit of success to believe in it and you could probably make the same argument for Mike Youngs team I mean being so young starting two true freshmen just getting a win or two changes everything nice play by Brandon Johnson to steal it and then turn right back over po wide open for the slam pretty interesting sequence and one to kind of make note of here over the last seven minutes of this game because it looked like Miami had a chance to go down and score on the break and all of a sudden you get an easy dunk fivepoint game and the crowds starting to come to life first 20po game in the career of Migel po T kid into a double kicks it up Schwarz down the lane over shoot no and the rebound Applause Music lell spinning through Johnson and draws the foul when he gets the ball and faces up and has a little bit of daylight I I dont know how you stop him I mean hes got such a quick first step and such good feed that was a great spin move right there that is almost impossible to guard oneonone Schwartz picks up the foul and so itll be laal to the free throw line Toby laal is a impressive player and brings Virginia Tech within Applause four had three threes against Duke earlier this week so its not just the interior play hes expanding his game now as a junior but you can see the increase in production from a scoring standpoint this year versus last now a threepoint game well Miami is going to continue to stay with that high ball screen action until Virginia Tech proves that they can stop it Ugo chukwu with an aggressive move to the basket well Miami is just doing something very simple but very smart theyre letting UGA chuku start on the left side of the floor that way when he comes off the screen hes going going to his right hand so if youre V Virginia Tech here need to make an adjustment keep him on that side of the floor and dont even let him come off the screen Hammond kicked it out bodys flying all over the floor and Hammond is down trying to hop back up uhoh holding on to the leg his shoe came off and Ben Hammond down on the floor wincing a bit and now Mike young out there with the trainer to attend to their freshman guard Miami up five on Virginia Tech with 611 to go here at Castle Coliseum in blackburg both teams will get a chance to go over to their respective benches but Hammond at least able to get a shoe back I didnt see initially what had happened was in the air o Johnson kind of falls on him yeah it looked like Brandon Johnson just came down landed right on his right foot thats obviously what pulled his shoe off lets hope obviously hes okay and he should get a a great look here oh right at the end there yep hopefully he was able to get that foot out of there in time before it got pinned under there too much and not too serious yeah Hammond walking around with the trainers so thats a good sign for sure keep an eye on him five to shoot now for the hokes Johnson 3 seconds to shoot shoot now Rex Steiner end the clock knocks down the three how do you like that well what a heck up play by Jaden shoot he knew Brandon re Steiner was wide open but he couldnt catch it cleanly so he basically just tapped it over there and Brandon Johnson from Miami got as high as he could he almost blocked a shot but give Rex Steiner credit just knocked down a huge three to make this a twopoint game and got the steeld going the other way kid turned it over Johnson yes were tied time out Miami 92 Run for the hokes Virginia Tech needed a spark of some kind and they got it on the underneath out of bounds play a great play by Jade shoot Rex Steiner with the big three tie game here in blackburg Music p Matthew Cleveland with a chance for a threepoint play and to give Miami a threepoint lead in this second half Miamis been real good from Beyond The Arc but its been a close game n ties 15 lead changes Elijah potit for the hokes with a careerhigh 20 points neither team has been able to make that run that has sunk the other and well see what happens over the final four minutes in a twopoint game between two teams that really need a win well if youre Virginia Tech I think you got to keep going inside go back to that ball screen action Migel potit set the screen whether its on the wing or in the middle roll either throw the high low or throw to the wing over and in Miami has not stopped that with success at any point in this game see if Mike young goes back to it the number two in Orange somebody else to keep an eye on Jaden shoot has had a quiet night by his standards but is capable of hitting a huge three at any point and a turnover by Virginia Tech that was tossed over the scores table and so Miami gets the basketball back up three and that is where the patience of Mike young is going to be tested those are the kinds of turnovers that come from freshman and unfortunately theres not a whole lot you can do theres no quick fix they just have to learn that you just cannot afford to make those kinds of plays kid guarded by po trying to get rid of the ball finally does tend to shoot Lugo chukwu finding kid as Divine is fouled by Tyler Johnson with 321 to go but four on the shot clock and a one andone opportunity is coming up man end the clock and that was good defense for 26 seconds from Virginia Tech but now Miami has a chance to in the lead Miami on the season has been a very good free throw shooting team at 79 conversely only 14 fouls for the hurricane so they can afford to be a little bit more aggressive on defense without worrying about sending the Hokies to the freto line and Ugo chuku knocks down the first hes got seven in the ball game tonight seven assists and his rooll running the point in place of the injured Nigel P one out of two and a missed opportunity laal and immediately Bea with the bucket to cost the hokes and how about the confidence of Jalil Bea when you get that rebound sometimes you think okay lets bring it out trying to run something he said no coach Im good Ive had a good day today Im going to keep it going six straight points for Miami and now a foul against Ugo Music chuku little things like free throw blockouts arent little things at the end of conference games and be a huge play at the end of this game all of a sudden instead of only being down four with a chance to go down and cut it to a one possession game now all of a sudden you find yourself down six with under three minutes to go hmon trying to change that for Virginia Tech swatted out of there by kid one of the few times today weve seen Rim protection from the Hurricanes but only 12 seconds on the shot clock not much room there for Ben Hammond driving Baseline but a good block by Lyn kid yeah 610 against 511 right Music there keep an eye on Jaden shoot right here inbound goes to Brown Jr for three like I said keep an eye on Ronney Brown shter in the corner that play was actually designed for Jaden sh but Rodney Brown said you know what Im open Im going to to take it now back to a one possession Applause Music game kid left open misses the jumper Cleveland through four guys grabs the rebound and a foul in the hokes that was just a big time rebound there by Matthew Cleveland you said it all Five Guys in Orange were in the lane Cleveland was really the only Miami hurricane player who tried to go after that ball and just went up and got it our next ACC Network womens basketball quadruple header tomorrow but were looking ahead at next Sundays four games three top 20 teams Duke in Virginia new Eastern then 17th ranked North Carolina and BC followed by Georgia Tech and Louisville will cap the day with Miami and Syracuse Matthew Cleveland knocks down the free throw 19 points in this one for Cleveland and Miami with a fourpoint lead with 217 to Music Applause go Hond knives into the paint against Ugo chuku Brown in the corner this time guarded tightly by Betha Browns going to drive it beats it to poti for the bucket how about that find I thought Rodney Brown Jr was dead in the water and a great drop off bounce pass Jin Tech finding a way to hang around nice pass inside and Cleveland throws it down what a play call by Bill Courtney the little tight curl got the defender to Chase and a great pass from Brandon Johnson to quiet this crowd perfect pass from Johnson its a fourpoint lead again 119 to go 10 to shoot for the hokes brown good pass poti the Miss underneath out of bounds itll stay with Virginia Tech potit couldnt handle it cleanly but the hokes will have another opportunity last time down Miami with a great set just a little Iverson cut over the top and Matthew Cleveland going back door when the defender trailing like that theres nothing they can do great set from the Hurricanes fresh 20 on the clock for Virginia Tech theres some space for lwell no tipped around potit lost the handle out of bounds off Miami with a minute left Miami playing with fire here allowing extra opportunities from the hokeys now a timeout no the substitution excuse me as Schwartz will come in for Betha and these are those special team type situations that these teams work extremely hard on Virginia Tech spent probably 25 of their shoot around today working on these types of situations just because of moment like Music Applause this a wild trying to direct traffic eight to shoot for the hokes good defense there by Matthew Cleveland on Jaden shoot potit over kid no Lal in there for the rebound of the putb twopoint game with 422 seconds left quick timeout Miami up two on the road Miami trying to hang on after their game earlier this week at Boston College they looked so good in the first half the wheels came off in the second half this game has been much more tightly contested all the way through but trying to earn their first ACC win of the season on the road here at Castle Coliseum Brown to inbound to Hammond and here we go Music 6 seconds Hammond trying to get around kid potit scores with 27 and a foul cannot say enough about the Poise of the young freshman Ben Hammond with the great pass to potit Rolling to the rims clearly the contact there on Pos left arm great finish chance to knock down the free throw and win this game what a big time play by The Freshman for Virginia Tech Ben Hammond and Migel poti four of six today at the line hes got a career best 24 points in this game tied at 85 potentially wins it with a free throw but first a Time time out taken by Bill Courtney and Applause Miami we talked about it all game long Lyn kid malel potit teammates at Virginia Tech the last few years kit now playing at Miami potit the lead big man for this team you knew going into this game the Migel potit was going to want to have a big game against Miami today hes having a career day 24 points and three rebounds in this one and now potentially wins the game for Virginia Tech if he can knock down this free throw with 27 left give Mike young and his staff credit they knew that Miami had not had an answer for that high ball screen all day with potit setting it and rolling they went right back to it the Ben Hammond what a big time play from the true freshman lot of times in that situation you try to force it but he made the exact right play at the right time heres the free throw from potit its good Virginia Tech up one 8685 27 left and Bill Courtney wants to draw something Applause up I go back to that play with about seven minutes to go in the game Miami was up put somebody on the ball which Mike young is going to do his best athlete Toby the wall try to get a deflection dont let Brandon Johnson see whatsoever all right Johnson will inbound Lal with the arms up inbound goes to Kid 1 second clock running down Cleveland at the buzzer no and Virginia Tech earns its first ACC win 86 85 oh
