be able to compete and contest One of the men we talked about Carson Tout will tip it off with Prince Johnson And we are underway from Southbend Sir Muhammad whos getting the start in place of the injured freshman Jaylen Harrelson who come off the bench today Starts it off for Notre Dame Here is Tout cheering Now they can work it over to Marcus Burton leading scorer for Notre Dame Mohamd on the drive cheering Irish working it around in this first possession Mohamd from the corner No good Late in the shot clock Battle for the rebound Taken by Eastern Illinois and Preston Turner He comes the other way for three No good there That was Cooper Jacobe And a fast and sloppy start to this one And Eastern Illinois wants it to be that way They want it to be scrappy They want it to be They were in every passing lane They were there on every catch in that first defensive possession not battling down here on offense And they are a team thats going to battle Coach Marty Simmons has been here for a while Hes had a long coaching career Every one of his teams battles He coaches that way coaches competitively and able to contest Well theyre battling out of the gate here Working it around the perimeter inside No good that time Sundra the rebound That was Cooper Jacobe missing Here comes Burton Take a look at the starting lineup for Notre Dame Marcus Burton Braden Shrewsbury Garrett Sundra Sir Mohamd like we mentioned and Carson Tout Pretty good look for Jacobe on the last possession in the post Just got to get a little eyes up a little earlier get that off the glass and get that finish in there Notre Dame still looking for their first points Scoreless over a minute into this one Marcus Burton has it now Burton fading away Thats a tough shot Missed it short Fight for the rebound Tout on the floor and a jump ball cheering Possession arrow stays with Notre Dame again Eastern Illinois there on the contest Making contested jump shots What Eastern Illinois is trying to do trying to be in their offense trying to make sure they contest every shot Tough look for Marcus Burton and Luke the guy we talked about Carson Tout right in the middle of things there Not surprising hes there on the floor being able to get a rebound He just shared it with other team He did In any case though Notre Dame will keep possession Dout surveying now finds Burton on the drive through traffic fading away Burton gets it to go Thats a tough shot but he makes a lot of those Averaging 18 and a half a game this season As we take a look at the Eastern Illinois starting lineup Mei White Zion Fster Preston Turner Prince Johnson and Cooper Jacobe will be the five for the Panthers as they respond quickly Preston Turner Nice execution down here on offense for East Illinois Great job screening Really really good job finding a defender and setting a screen Turner the transfer from Mineral Area Community College where he averaged nearly 14 a game last year Sir Mohamd had the offensive rebound off the Braden Shrewsbury miss Now Burton inside for tout that missed it cheering Here comes White the other way Work it over right side Its Turner back for White Now Jacobe on the drive walled off nicely by Shrewsbury Frewster leading scoreer for the Panthers and Turner nearly had it taken away Battle for it on the floor again and well get our third jump ball of the game less than 3 minutes in And its been Eastern Illinoiss running long possessions with a music lot of screens getting a lot of ball reversals Not playing good defense being able to be in spots being able to music be in spaces Both teams trying to execute here early in the season One on the shot clock here Look for look for them to get even maybe an elevator look right here up the middle in this box set for something quick A lob pass They throw the lob and Jacobe was there but could not convert Itll stay with Eastern Illinois though Well executed by Eastern Illinois on the lob pass with one second Thats a tough play on the sideline out of bounds and thats a really hard pass to make Great job on the pass fake and then throwing the pass Panthers inbound quickly and that shot was long Fster whos averaging 18 and a half a game for the Panthers couldnt get that one to fall Here comes Sir Mohamd Now Sundra Irish working it around Great defense from Eastern Illinois Five on the shot clock Shrewberry got to put something up Tout from the elbow Did he get it off Missed it anyway Got his own rebound Now Shrewberry for three He hits Tout on the rebound A lot of late shot clock plays so far I think that fits Eastern Illinois more than it fits Notre Dame Eastern Illinois controlling a little bit of the pace here to start the game Late shot clock possessions offensively They like running their stuff and then defensively theyre forcing Notre Dame into late shot clock plays cuz theyre just not giving up uncontested drives straight line drives or uncontested shots On the make there was Shrewberry continuing his momentum from Fridays win when he scored 19 points and made five threes Touts got his second rebound of the game Here comes Burton takes the screen on the drive and hes fouled and the basket cheering Great finish here by Burton with the inside left hand Impressive move from Burton They did a great job of getting the defender on his music back and then that finish with his left foot down his left hand on the inside gets that in one But just a phenomenal job as a guard comes off and gets that defender on his back Now the defender has to help because his defender is actually behind him Its almost like a post up from a guard And so as he gets a little snake dribble gets him on his back and then he drives comes all the way in and then a fantastic just left music hand left foot finish Burtons incredibly skilled scores the basketball in a lot of different ways And I think as he continues into this year its important for Notre Dame that he continues to find the right ways to score and hes patient within those as they have a few more options and continue to attack You see the numbers last season averaged nearly 21 a half a game while shooting almost 40 from three He was a really dynamic player not just for Notre Dame but in all of the ACC Five points already here early The scorings actually a little down this season as Notre Dame has seen balanced contributions in their first two games but hes the guy they lead on when things get tough as they have been in the first couple minutes of this game Meanwhile heres Eastern Illinois working it around Heres Fster on the drive Nice finish Zion Fster on the board for the Panthers Good patience again there for Eastern Illinois Frewster finally gets some gets a pass that primary defender to get an attack That was their first basket Nearly three minutes Heres Kaylor now into the game Wholesale substitution for Notre Dame Save for Marcus Burton Takes the screen from Jai and he lost it but was fouled Heres a look at Micah Shrewberry the head coach for Notre Dame in his third season and looking for a bounceback year And I was at an event for for an alumni event Jack Swarberg was speaking He talked about Micah has a music PhD in basketball And I I dont disagree with him I I dont disagree with Jack Swarbber often anyway but Micah Shrewsbury learned it from Brad Stevens learning from the people hes learned from and I just think that his players are are being able to execute the things that hes able to do He has unbelievable exinos He has unbelievable culture building that he builds in the right way And I think as hes heading into his third season hes hitting that stride of the team has bought in The culture is there and now theyre able to execute upon that And I think that it shows well from guys that are back that are returners that have improved and the number of returners in a environment in college basketball that that doesnt always happen Well its early this season but the Irish picked up their first 30point win under Shrewberry Certainly a welcome sign there Meanwhile Jai hits one of two free throws Hed been excellent coming into this one from the line Almost 86 Heres Terry McMorris who normally wears 24 Hes wearing eight tonight for the Panthers Averaging 10 points a game on the year Burton runs through that pass Nearly took it away Jacobe has it top of the key Mc Morris into a crowd and shot clocks going to expire Great defensive possession from Notre Dame Coaching pet peeve though Burton if he goes with the inside hand hes got that steal and hes gone He goes to the outside hand he comes all the way through If he misses that right there hes out of position Would love just those little execution pieces I think Micah keeps teaching inside hand on that deflection there Hes in front of him He misses it I think he inside hand he gets a steal and hes got a bucket Well things like that are what he emphasized when we talked to him earlier today the little details is what hes looking for his team to improve on He is and building into this building into the conference play Its going to be incredibly challenging for him again this year And being able to build for every possession he kept talking about after shoot Heres Harelson Thats a tough finish for the freshman Highest rated recruit in program history at the time of his signing last year Missed the last game with a concussion but is on the board early here Great job getting really deep in the paint by Harelson there on the drive Now heres Fster Hits the midrange pullup Four points for Zion Fster Now good execution by Eastern Reversal into a ball screen Fster hits a pull up The Virginia Wise transfer Like we said the leading scorer for Eastern Illinois this year Jai drops it off for Harelson whos on the drive again Waldoff nicely though whips it to the corner Heres Serta He misses that one Dont see that too often Sertas been hyper efficient so far this season shooting 50 from three Really nice pass by Harelson to be able to find that in the corner be able to get it there You think Sertas probably going to be good from there more often than not on the drive Jacobe gets in deep and finishes Good move He missed that one early I like his eyes just a little bit more on the rim Great finish by Jacobe inside Eastern Illinois within one possession 13 minutes to go in this first half Jai throws it away Wasnt on the same page with Serta Quick take a look at this Harelson finish from a couple moments ago that got Notre Dame to 11 points Luke you really like this Just a big physical finish So I like him getting two feet in the paint being able to get in into the lane and then being able to use his body to protect between him and defender to be able to go up and finish He plays sort of a point forward role for Notre Dame Hes large for a guard but he likes to handle it and get downhill Heres Mei White now for the Panthers Swings it for Jacobe in the corner whos guarded by Jai Fster out for Jacobe Threepointer in and out Jai the rebound Here comes Harelson Serta again from the corner No good that time Jai has the rebound cheering Back out and he threw it away Backcourt violation A couple miscommunication turnovers here by Jai Going to take Shbury going to give some feedback here Yeah Good rebound by Jive Good job in transition by Notre Dame Eastern Illinoiss had such long possessions and theyve had a few makes here that Notre Dame hasnt got out in transition a ton Another good look by Serta You continue to live with that as you know hes a shooter that can knock him down A couple of open looks that hes just missed And to some degree regression to the mean is expected for Notre Dame who are shooting 47 12 from three as a team coming into this one And on the other side Eastern Illinois probably due for some positive regression Theyre shooting just 188 from three as a team and 319 from the field And and they both are executing Its early in the season Youre figuring out your teammates Youre figuring out some new players Youre figuring out new spots Get it in the hands of Shrewberry now throws it over for IS His three is good Logan I scores in a three Really nice shot Good good ball movement by Notre Dame Logans averaging just 35 a game but hes a very experienced player for Notre Dame 65 games played over the last two seasons Here he comes quickly up the floor now Harelson cheering guarded by McMorris I again for three Not that time Rebound taken by Alafio Whips it up the court for Fster inside Nice look for Mc Morris and he was fouled Under 12 minutes to go in the first half schedule Hes looking for tough games for his kids and then hes just looking for flatout toughness toughminded players that know how to play the game He teaches old school I would consider it and and his players respond to it and have done well Andrew Austin missing the three there for Eastern Illinois Heres Ryder Frost from the corner His three no good Notre Dame just two of seven from downtown so far Good look so far though You get open uncontested looks that are in range and in rhythm Mc Morris on the drive no good Got his own rebound missed it again and Frost takes the rebound Here comes IS now for Notre Dame and an offensive foul Theyll get tout on the push I dont know I think hes trying to battle for position Maybe got just a little bit too much of the arms What the officials will see Hes asking for an explanation from the officials down here Third turnover for Notre Dame Well take a look at it here Officials telling him he felt like he pushed off with the one arm just got a little bit extended there Thats a tough call Battling with Andrew Austin the red shirt sophomore and transfer from De Mo Area Community College Turner on the drive lays it in cheering Nice move from the red shirt junior Now here goes Burton with a lane up and under Nearly finished it Turner the rebound Here comes Eastern Illinois Mc Morris on the run cheering Couldnt finish through the contact Frost the rebound and and now Notre Dame quickly the other way IMS Burton in the corner cheering on the drive through the lane and the finish Great look ahead by IS Great job by Burton to not force that corner three and really get to the rim Notre Dames missed some jumpers and when youre missing a few jumpers you got just got to see it go through being able to get attack in the paint there Seven points for Marcus Burton early here Fster over for Austin Nothing but air but a nice play by McMorris to throw it off of Burton and keep it with Eastern Illinois A couple of nice plays here A couple of nice drives Turner with the first drive here Just attacks a close out And then Burton here with a second drive as hes looking being able to go finish and just finishing here off the glass cheering Olafoier now for Eastern Illinois falls down and hes immediately swarmed by Tout and Burton Theyll call it a jump ball Possession arrow with the Irish unlucky there as youre trying to get into your move Just didnt quite get it there Flat tire if you will Sloppy game on both sides to start it out And and I think it that favors Eastern Illinois just coach Simmons style of wanting to be able to hold this game into a grinded out defensive battle being able to play there Coach Shrewsbury looking for how his guys respond He wants to see them respond in possession after possession He was talking about it Three possessions in a row offensively Three possessions in a row defensively Burton a three Not that time cheering Rebound Johnson Here comes the Lafoier Walled off by Tout Now Jacobe Blackwell now into the game for the first time tonight cheering Gets it over to Turner Good ball movement here from Eastern Illinois Six on the shot clock Five to go on the shot clock Blackwell puts it up and misses Long Rebound tipped and taken by Sundra Burton up for Rimes Good defensive possession there by Notre Dame Long 30 second defensive possession You got to stay locked in on every screen every cutter Great job by Notre Dame there Inside Good look for Sundra and he finishes Good execution Coach Shrewsbury trying to get him going a little bit over there and I think just getting him going in the paint right right there Another paint touch on the pick and roll Sundra very efficient in part because hes getting shots like that a lot this season 60 from the field coming into this one Jacobe on the drive and finishes Tough move He missed that first move Hes gotten rolling since then Shrewberry now quickly the other way Ives for tout I for three Missed it long Rebound to Lafio Up for Blackwell Now inside its Jacobe cheering Turner on the drive gets past Sundra up and under Fancy finish from Preston Turner And Eastern Illinois within two Turner with a couple of drives on that left baseline Just kind of that transition secondary to attack and close outs Here comes Burton trying a move of his own He missed it Afio runs Jacobe right side Its Turner Drops it off One more Blackwell hits from the corner and Eastern Illinois has the lead Poked away from Shrewberry and it will be Notre Dame ball when we come back Eastern Illinois is doing a phenomenal job of just executing right here Turner on a drive just gets a baseline drive finishes on the opposite side uses the rim to protect himself there against Sundra the taller defender And then the next possession Turners made a couple of drives music He could take the shot but Eastern Illinois has been unselfish Theyve been disciplined so far to start this game And as theyre attacking theyve got extra pass Great deal of cornering for Blackwell three And theyve taken the lead 1918 with under seven minutes to go Sir Mohamd inbounds for Notre Dame Finds Jai Burton takes a screen Mei White Harrelson on the drive spinning dropping it off and Chai finishes That was a great extra pass And for Notre Dame right now youre looking for Haroldson Theyre looking for Muhammad Youre looking for somebody else to step up alongside Marcus Burton And this is going to be where Notre Dame has to take their next step is whos going to be able to step up with them I think Braden Shrewsbury is another guy thatll be able to Jacobe missing the three Sir Mohamd the rebound Screen from Jai Mohamd downhill and he traveled Lets take a look at the last possession for Notre Dame before that sir Mohammed travel What a nice pass from Harelson An excellent pass just to be able to finish J above the rim being able to just see that have that vision Two feet in the paint though The more times that Notre Dames got two feet in the paint Good things have happened for them cheering Mei White the other way for Eastern Illinois finding Prince Johnson Top of the key Work it over left side Turner now cheering Jacobe again Frewster Defense by Sundra Frewster Stop and go He hits into the shot clock again but theyre running their stuff They got the match up with Fster with a big on him and he just attacked found enough space knocked it down Good move there to free himself up Now heres Sundra trying to find Burton Will take it himself Now Harelson hits Pass is intercepted And here comes Beachy White the other way cheering Brewster Now Johnson again The Panthers working it around Good defense there by Sir Mohamd Itll stay with Eastern Illinois with under 10 on the shot clock Patient offense from Eastern Illinois And they reverse the basketball a lot They get it from side to side I Im looking for Notre Dame here as Eastern Illinoiss gotten into their sets gotten into their rhythm to take away a pass take away a passing lane to be able to get up into somebody thats handling the basketball to be able to pressure them as they get here Eastern Illinois continues to execute well Nichi White now drops it off Brewster His three way off and the shot clocks going to expire better defensive possession from Notre Dame there and and they did and they found a way to contest They stayed matched up They talk through I just think Notre Dames got to impact Eastern Illinois sets right now Theyre setting a lot of offball screens Theyre reversing the basketball A lot of ball screens Theyve got to find impact on their defense and be able to make a difference Nice pass Harelson on the back cut and powers it down cheering Great pass to find him Harrisons been a spark for the Irish here in the first half Great pass from Sir Mohamd Eastern Illinois now More of what weve seen Jacobe on the drive Mohamed is there Now Fster the pull up and hits They take a lot of good shots Theyre waiting on their their shot as the possession goes And Fster when he gets to his spots is tough Check that It was Mei White Now heres Mohhamd And Notre Dame finally some consistency on offense although the Panthers have matched it these last couple possessions Heres White dropping it off This is Fster for three Its Turner Missed it long Jai the rebound Notre Dame the other way cheering Burton off the screen finds Jai and he lost it out of bounds Eastern Illinois ball Notre Dame leads the Panthers 2423 And finally weve gotten some fun offense Mohamad to Harelson The Irish lead by one Notre Dame pride no more dear and far our alumni continue to serve faith honor I almost think its a rooster package I mean team near halftime and theyre just playing defense on every possession theyre talking theyre getting through screens theyre making plays and a great wide open dunk for Jacobe well executed after the timeout by coach Simmons in Eastern Illinois cheering and the Panthers have the lead as well get a foul off the ball here Excuse me It was not a foul Looks like Marcus Burton might be bleeding off his arm So theyll get him cleaned up And well take a look at the junk the dunk from Jacobe A great look out of the timeout as they look just to screen the screener into a pick and roll Notre Dame hedges Nobody recovers A great job by Jacobe of just rolling to the basket Great pass finding an angle Really good draw by Eastern Illinois Tough to guard when youve got your ball screener They get screened first And Notre Dames got to talk Notre Dames got to be aggressive on music their switches or theyve got to find a way to be able to get over the top of that Burton had a little bit of blood like we said on that left forearm but they get him cleaned up and were playing again He finds Mohhamd takes a screen from Tout gets downhill and finishes with the left Nice finish inside hand finish Good job Again Notre Dame getting two feet in the paint has been really good Their spacings fantastic but theyve got to be able to attack the paint and then be able to work their way out He shot 73 at the rim last season as Jacobe hits a three and hes feeling it He is feeling it Hes made some really nice plays Theyve left him open a few times Hes now knocked a few in seen it gone go in and now hes hitting contested threes Foul underneath away from the ball Looks like theyll get Mei White with a hold on Sir Mohamd And Luke you got to figure Marty Simmons likes what hes seeing from his squad 100 They want to be able to slow the game down They want to be able to execute where theyre at Hes getting some really big plays from guys like Jacobe here in the last few possessions as hes looking at 226 left on the half and youre up two on the road Notre Dame nearly turned it over there Shrewsbury had it batted away but Eastern Illinoiss earned it Theyve earned it on each possession Theyve executed Theyve been guarding Theyre talking They have a lot of energy down here Even though theyre on on the road they finding energy between themselves from their bench from their coaches Mohamd a three no good Tout skies for the rebound and he was fouled on the way up This is where I look for Touts leadership right The the leadership of just being able to make plays being able to find rebounds find plays just find extra possessions Hes talking a little bit more here Oh look at that Just throw him out of the way Thats a fantastic rebound Get it in for Shrewsbury Nicely defended by Eastern Illinois Burton with a screen for Tout Works his way inside and finishes again with that snake dribble of Burton of just getting that defender on his back after he has started that pick and roll and then theyre out in position I think about I think about Tout how a veteran of a player he is But hes in game three for Notre Dame here So I look for him now Okay listen Youve been around for a little while now I need your leadership here on this defensive end Hes talking a lot more on this possession talked on the last possession and he got a piece of that one Here comes Shrewsbury for Mohhamd the floater Tout the offensive board just like you said Luke making an impact Burton finds him now to the corner Its Ims his three no good and Tout is fouled again He got double teamed on that rebound like a fantastic defensive lineman with two offensive linemen be music attacking He had two guys boxing him out You dont see a double teamed rebound very often but you also dont see the nations leading rebounder very often either No you do not Hes got five boards already in this one and probably would have had a couple more if not for these fouls Luke like you mentioned this looks like football inside when Touts in there and he creates it He creates a toughness that Notre Dame needs inside and hes doing a fantastic job of filling that role on moving screen there Yeah maybe a little too physical that time Thats the second on tout He looked over at coach Rusbury and said Im good He didnt want to come out right now He wants to finish this half even though hes got two fouls Looks like theyll let him for now 120 to go Tie game Turner defended by Shrewsbury tries to get it inside Fight for it Taken by Eastern Illinois now Jacobe tried to get it inside Mohamed couldnt save it And itll be Panther ball But deflections from Notre Dame This is the defense that they werent music doing to start the game of just getting deflections getting in passing lanes not letting Eastern music Illinois reverse the basketball multiple times without anybody in passing lanes Much better defense here And I I think Touts energy on the glass and just being in here and talking and communicating has started it for them Inside wild shot Tout the rebound Here comes Burton the other way That was Johnson missing for the Panthers Burtons fouled on the outside One more before Eastern Illinois is in the bonus Excuse me Before Notre Dame is in the bonus Coach Shrewsbury doesnt want to take any chances of Tout getting his third foul in the first half Makes a lot of sense here with 54 seconds left But I think Tout was a little disappointed as a competitor to not be still out there And theyll get a little more shooting on the floor with Sundra Sundra subbed in for Tout said Who me Theres some people that just love the game And I think to be able to love rebounding the way that Tout does hes got to be able to love the game First game two points 19 rebounds If youre going to play and youre not scoring a whole lot but youre doing everything your team needs youre being the fundamental teammate that you have to be And thats Carson Tout for Notre Dame They get Burton in isolation and he drops it in with the foul Fantastic move And I think just Notre Dame here finishing the half music Coach talked about it after shootound today of how he wants the team to finish the half better and be able to be here Notre Dame has done that here today Great job on the crossover A spin move getting him on the back Takes the contact Eyes on the rim Fantastic finish for the and one Having some words with Preston Turner as he goes to the line Theyre probably just becoming pen pals Im sure 11 points now for Marcus Burton He looks to make it 12 right here So he hits the free throw 12 points for Marcus Burton on five of nine from the field Thats the efficiency weve come to expect from him this season Hes up above 50 from the field and 50 from three as his pass is fumbled in the corner by McMorris Now heres Turner defended by Ims Tough shot Didnt get it to go and a foul on Notre Dame Theyll call it on Burton with a push under the basket Notre Dame flying around a lot more Eastern Illinois is moving at a pace that theyre less comfortable with as Notre Dame continues to attack close outs Theyre even they missed a couple of rotations but theyre making them aggressively Theyre talking where theyre going here The last few possessions Notre Dames defense has been much better Eastern Illinois has been very good on these inbound sets Alafio triggers now gets it to the corner No good that time from Brewster Sundra the rebound Notre Dame can hold for one shot Coach Ruseberry mentioned to us how important it was to close halves and they can do that here That did a great job scoring the last possession You look for two for one End of the possession Now youre looking for a screen Looking for a shot Go screen from Shrewberry I from the corner No good And that will be the half Well Notre Dame 31 Eastern Illinois 28 Luke what you think Notre Dame Quickly on the drive goes Turner Blocked by Burton and Shrewsbury comes up with the steal Pull up three Thats a good start for Notre Dame Braden Shrewsbury puts the Irish up six And Notre Dame a stop and a score Coach Shrewberry was talking about it Stop score Being able to have multiple possessions in a row Good defensively good offensively Fster now defended by Shrewsbury Quickly to the corner Its White inside Turner and hes fouled Take a look at this first possession for Notre Dame Braden Shrewsbury hitting the pullup triple and and Notre Dame defensively on this first possession Comes out good deflections being able to make plays Then Shrewsbury just finds his spot to be able to knock down a shot Only had a a bucket in the first half So look for him to get going here as the second half gets started Two of three from three for the junior Heres Preston Turner now for the Panthers Mineral Area Community College transfer where he averaged 137 points and five rebounds a game He began his career at Truman State where he red shirted his freshman season averaging nine points a game on the year for the Panthers Sinks both there and its a fourpoint game Harelson wild out to Mohamd Burton for three and he connects Turned out well but you dont want Harelson leaving his feet on the pass on that one Great drive though the Burton screen That small to big screen as Harelson gets downhill Backto back threes for Notre Dame to open the half Eastern Illinois trying to respond This is their man in the first half Jacobe nearly turned it over Now they get it to White Open threepointer and he answers Good job by Eastern Illinois seeing Burton guarding Jacobe looking for the mismatch and then Jacobe being able to pass out of that for the rotations to be able to get an open shot Panthers staying within swinging distance This is what they did in the first half Bert in the post drops it off Tout and hes fouled Good inside pass by Burton Good job by Tout to be able to find that contact get himself to the line Tout no points on the day but he had six rebounds in that first half three offensive rebounds I look for him just again his leadership was big there in the first half about that caught at that 8 minute mark the last couple of media timeouts Got to be a leader here at the line being able to knock these in But for for Tout that leadership being able to be the veteran transfer I know hes only been here for three games but hes been around basketball plenty And so just his leadership being able to make those plays get a bucket and then be able to play defense and hes going to bank it here on a Tuesday I know banks are closed for Veterans Day but uh I do believe the bank is open for Tout here today Yeah federal holiday bank is still open for Carson Tout Thats been an area where he struggled at just 50 for the year and he shot under 50 at Northern Arizona last season Hits one there Irish lead by five Jacobe cheering Now heres Turner Nichi White defended by Burton They get it to Turner with a pump fake Off balance Nearly hit it at the end of the shot clock Harrelson the rebound Quickly the other way Burton A pump fake and a drive down the middle Dropping it off Tout couldnt finish got his own rebound and Burton pump fake finds Harelson drives in and an offensive foul cheering Irish passed up a couple of good looks on that possession They did and and theyre being patient from Harelson there Id love an opportunity for him as as a freshman just to be patient there He can just jump stop He hes not going to get all the way to the rim just can jump stop there kick it back out go and drive the next time when hes got an angle That was Preston Turner drawing the charge And now Jacobe hits from the corner Second threepointer of the game for Cooper Jacobe Jacobs having a game He saw seen it go through Had a couple of misses to start but hes really gotten it going since then Now he defends Harelson More patient from Harelson here than the last possession Backing his way in Burton for three No good tout another offensive rebound his fifth of the game Hes finding rebounds and he positions himself so music well right as soon as the shots going up and then he just sees the basketball He finds it He does what He rebounds out of his area If we would look at the distance traveled from the time the ball is released until the ball hits the rim Carson Tout covers a lot of ground between those two and rebounds out of his area He just seems to always be around the ball no matter where it is He does and I think its his eyes and then its just physical aggressive and finding a way to get that rebound Burton takes a screen from Touts inside Oh nice finish from Tout cheering applause Beautiful reverse layin Really good job I I really like last possession Tout talked for all 33 seconds until the shot went up last time down talked on cutters talked on the help and an offensive foul illegal screen They call it on Mei White away from the ball And Eastern Illinois still working to execute their game still sticking with their gameplay but Notre Dame now is making it tougher to get into screens Theyre working to get through and around screens Theyre making sure not to give a screener their shoulders to be able to slide over or under a screen And theyre doing a much better job defensively here since the middle of that first half and and starting here in the second half Started out with Harelson handling He gets downhill and hes fouled Little too much contact that time from Fster and and really good sets here I like where theyre screen setting these screens for Harelson and getting smaller guards as Eastern Illinois switching Harrelsons getting downhill on the smaller guards Whip it out to the corner Shrewberry wide open and he connects Well executed baseline out of bounds Shrewberry now three of four from downtown cheering inside quickly and mishandled by Fster under the basket and multiple possessions in a row now Not Notre Dame scored Notre Dames played defense here Really good execution and good execution here on the baseline out of bounds Sets a couple screens and Shrewsbury gets in the corner and knocks it down Youre not going to want to leave him open Brersberry is going to knock down those open shots and found a good rhythm here to start the second half Harelson handling again into the post he goes Whips it to Burton in the far corner His three Not that time Sir Mohamd the rebound but theyll call a foul Itll be offensive on Notre Dame So itll be Eastern Illinois ball when we return on the ACC Network Extra But just Harelson being able to get on a screen Burton setting the screen So his defender is a smaller defender Then Harrison is a taller defender He draws three here on this play Gets the ball out and then gets a extra pass being able to get there Not quite two feet in the paint but he draws three defenders Hes tall enough Hes Hes able to get over the top of the defenders And here another angle another look Just as Harelson gets here he draws three defenders Makes a good decision Probably could have dumped that one to tout but instead out to Sir Mohamd Extra pass Easy look for Burton Burtons had some tough looks today Thats one of the easier ones hes gotten but Jerald Harelson sets it up so as he can get there and be able to attack Two assists for him on the night to go with four points A hockey assist on that one I know it doesnt get in the books but Harelsons making some plays here Thats a way theyre going to try and use him this season as more of an on ball presence as Eastern Illinois has it now Austin had it briefly They go inside for Jacobe whos guarded by the much smaller Burton cheering Fster working on Shrewberry Shot clock expires Excellent defense for Notre Dame Very good Thats the one Eastern Illinois was getting shots in the first half Notre Dame placed through the shot clock Finishes the possession there And thats where coach Shrewsbury is talking about building habits on every single possession Notre Dame wins that possession right there Three turnovers in the last two minutes for Eastern Illinois that one the latest They did not turn it over much in the first half Now Burton again open from the corner Not that time Tout offensive rebound SHREWBERRY FROM THE LOGO HE HITS Great great shot Obviously if he can knock that down but great extra possession from Tout and I even like the shot from Burton on the kick out Again a catch and shoot for Burton As good of a scorer as he is if hes going to get uncontested catch and shoot theyre going to be dangerous and he took it away Trying to find Shrewsbury again Burton on the drive Notre Dame by 12 Now Notre Dames defense creating their offense getting in transition Really good job Really good stretch here Timeout Eastern Illinois The Irish cheering Well Eastern Illinois has seen Notre Dame open up a 12point lead on a 100 run Luke what did you see here Just great job here in the second half Notre Dames getting extra possessions Obviously if Shrewsbury can hit logo threes then as you called it unbelievable to be able to create that kind of spacing Tout with an extra possession Then Burton just getting all the way to the rim Great finish on the opposite side being able to get there Notre Dames getting stops Theyll get scores A lot more music energy here to start the second half See the comparison here Notre Dame was just two for 13 from three in the first half and theyre four of seven from three in the second half Thatll work as a percentage And theyre getting better shots Just more in rhythm Theyre getting better looks Theyre getting better opportunities Burton fouls Alafio there One more look at this graphic You see Notre Dame 60 from the field and over that from three Just rolling here from behind the ark and and just a great job of sharing the basketball too How many uncontested threes theyve had in the second half and earlier in the shot clock Eastern Illinois was fuller into late shot clock plays in the first half here in the second half Theyve gotten into their actions earlier and gotten in their shots Another foul for Notre Dame Logan IMS a grab off the ball So its been tough sledding for Eastern Illinois A lot of attention paid to the Irish offense but the defense has been good as well Eastern Illinois four turnovers in the last three minutes and they have not scored in 258 Fster trying to change that Whips it over for Turner whos defended by Shrewsbury He gets inside and finishes Nice finish Eastern Illinois needed a bucket here Its been a while and they got one in a crowd from Preston Turner Himmes snags that one Turner now working on 10 points Nice night for him Irish get it over to Sundra Now Shrewberry hes four of five from three Hasnt attempted a shot from inside the ark yet today Sundra for Mohamd One more Ims in the corner Didnt get it to go and a foul on Notre Dame Sir Mohamd picks it up Take a look at the finish here from Preston Turner Great job here by Turner just attacking a close out Makes a spin move Gets all the way to the rim and just a tough finish But again off of two feet in the paint If you can find that balance off two feet go up and be able to finish Great job by Turner And Eastern Illinois trying to chip away at this Notre Dame lead They trail by 10 Mc Morris now out for Jacobe He was their man in the first half and hes the leading scorer for the Panthers with 12 Thats a tough shot there Rebound Jacobe and he puts it back up and in Led the conference last year in rebounds but being able to be there Jacobs made a lot of really good plays Second effort plays Made some plays here Not quick down transition Shrewsbury not sure if that was a pass or a shot In any case the Irish keep the ball Mohamed had it wide open Passed it to Bert whos on the drive Takes some contact Gets his own rebound Hes in a crowd and he threw it away And the Panthers nearly do the same before Alfoay collects it cheering Hes now defended by Ims Frewster works his way over to Preston Turner Now Jacobe on the drive Lafio Good defense from IMS Five on the shot clock Burton defends and the shot clock expires Really good defensive possession from Notre Dame Eastern Illinois really trying to continue to run their sets They do a good job of reversing the basketball being able to get there but Notre Dame just did not have any mistakes on that possession Little bit of pressure here from Eastern Illinois They came out the last time out Just trying to change it up here Change up Notre Dames rhythm Irish let Harelson handle it Just into the game for Sir Mohamd defended by Fster trying to back his way in Double team Shrewsbury Now Burton on the drive and he was fouled We will head to break with Notre Dame holding an eightpoint advantage It was as many as 12 Eastern Illinois trying to claw their way back was third in the conference Luke showing why tonight Hes done a great job here coming out in the second half Transition bucket scores off a well executed baseline on a bounce scores off of a tout rebound for a kick out to a logo three And all of a sudden Notre Dames found their rhythm offensively found their energy defensively being able to get in passing lanes being able to get into the ball pressure of the ball handler and talking defensively trying to parlay this performance off a nice one His last time out he had 19 in a 32point win on Friday Harelson slips trying to get it from Tout Eventually does get it back Tries to go left and is fouled Great job being able to get into the paint Harelson when hes got a height advantage on a defender Also has some physicality and just being able to continue to attack I like his patience on that one being able to be there He had the earlier charge and I think hes just done music better here as the games gone on being able to have great patience and then he finds an angle and finds that ankle gets the rim draws the foul gets himself to the line get a couple of easy ones here Free throws are always uncontested so you get that opportunity to be able to get to the line That breaks a 2 minute and 53 second scoring drought for Notre Dame Again like we mentioned earlier Harelson did not play against Detroit Mercy after suffering a concussion midway through the first game against LIU Air ball on the floater there Harelson has the rebound and hes quickly in transition and is fouled again as he goes flying towards the Irish bench Excellent job of getting the rebound and just pushing for Harelson be able to get it get everybody out in transition being able to get the ball ahead and now hes got himself back on the free throw line These will be just the ninth and 10th free throws for Notre Dame Eastern Illinois has only taken two Its a physical game but that hasnt necessarily resulted in a lot of free throws thus far made both his last time and he hits the first end of the one and one here Highest rated recruit in program history McDonalds AllAmerican last year top rated player in Indiana Everybody wanted him He had offers from top top programs So it was a really big win for coach Rusberry and his staff to get him to Southbend showing why tonight with eight points on perfect efficiency Hes make making a big difference for the Irish in the lineup just being a tall guard Great shot there from Fster Yeah Fster the tough midranger cuts the lead to 10 Now this pressure like you talked about Luke Cole Serta hes been quiet tonight and I think Eastern Illinois is just trying to slow it down Theyre not trying to trap Theyre just trying to get into space Slow down the Irish rhythm right now Harrelson defended by Jacobe Almost threw it away IMS tracks it down Heres Tout under the basket cheering and finishes Really nice pass from Good job by Tout Well executed by Notre Dame Took a little while but Tout has his fifth point of the game cheering Brewster now drops it off for Jacobe Heres Turner spinning double teamed Lafiier kicks it out Heres a three No good that time Ims the rebound cheering That was Fster Harrelson now spinning his way in and nearly converting the and one but hell go to the line again Take a look at last couple highlights for Notre Dame here Great job by Ives on last possession of being able to get that ball to Tal Great music patience by Talon I I think he counts as a rebound Hes probably counting that on the first one there And then here just on Harelson being able to get to the rim be able to get this nice spin move getting an angle on his defender and getting to the line again Has really gotten to the free throw line here the last few possessions Notre Dame while being able to have that energy Another thing theyve got theyve really dominated the glass and obviously you expect that from tout but youve got 30 rebounds for Notre Dame 17 Theyre plus 13 right now at second chance points Notre Dames got 12 to Eastern Illinois two So really dominating on the glass being able to execute their game plan and theyre doing it by possession by possession right now Harelson hits one of two there Hes up to nine points Irish have opened up a 13point lead Fster now trying to cut into it for Eastern Illinois Finds McMorris trying to step his way through on tout Had it taken away Diving on the floor is Harelson They get it away to Fster as the switch on tout McMorris on the drive Harrelson falls down and McMorris misses it short Offensive rebound to Lafi Heres Turner wide open He cant pay it off And Sir Mahamemed the rebound Serta pull up jack Not that time Here comes Fster right by Sir Muhammad but couldnt lay it in over Serta It stays with Eastern Illinois up and down sequence there and it has been and here right here you look for Notre Dame to have a have a tout have somebody pull them together get a stop be able to make a play here for Eastern Illinois this pace theyre theyre trying to push this pace just to change the rhythm of the game as Irish have played really well here in the second half Brewster guarded by Shrewsbury Spinning fading and couldnt get it to go Harrelson pushing in transition again Loves that spin move Sprays it out Mohamd Work it over for Bert Set number seven Pull up three missed it long and Fster has the rebound but Sir Mohamd was fouled on the way up and he is down for the moment Scary moment there for Sir Muhammad I think theyre going to take a look at it here Mohamd the sophomore missed a lot of time last season with injury Obviously never like to see this Well take a look at the play here One up for the offensive rebound and he gets kicked in the face it looks like on the way down Referees look at a potential flagrant foul here on the kick That was Zion Fster going up for the rebound for Eastern Illinois catching Mohamd on the way down The flagrant two is aggressive and youve got intent to go with it I dont think his intent on that one was to to be able to kick him but theyll take a look at it here Look at it here See Fster comes down and definitely unintentionally catches Mohamd in the head with the back of his foot That was the ver verdict from the officials did a good job of looking at it Theres been a pretty good crew tonight Theyve been talking to players quite a bit which you get a lot of respect for officials thatll communicate whats going on especially here early in the season about how things are going to be called Be able to get a feel for what you can and cant do It was a one and one for Notre Dame Mohamd missed the front end So Eastern Illinois now Heres Fster Turner defended by Harelson 10 on 10 Theyve been going at it all night Gets the switch on Tout Turner still searching Good defense from Tout and he just throws it up but hes fouled So Preston Turner will go to the line for the Panthers Tout felt like he was straight up here Obviously Turners glad to be able to go go to the line The officials saw it differently I think he got called for that left hand Just extended with the left hand Golden Vet move where hes got the left hand in there that you cant quite see but he gets some space from him And the left hand gets extended Gets called for that foul Fourth foul on tout Turner has been the only player to shoot a free throw for Eastern Illinois tonight He was two for two before that one and now hes three of three So this will be just the fourth free throw for the Panthers tonight The Irish have shot 13 Especially with Notre Dame playing more aggressive here the second half and into that first half Theyve done a good job of doing it without without fouling So Turner hits both there Hes up to 11 points Third Panther in double figures Burton now right side into a crowd Shrewberry wide open and he connects Fantastic pass by Mart Threepointer of the night Great shot by Shrewsbury but a fantastic pass by Marcus Burton A good job to find the shooter there Eastern Illinois now Turner finds Johnson Now its White Turner for three Couldnt answer Didnt even hit the rim Jai battle for it on the ground and a jump ball Possession arrow with Notre Dame Under eight minutes to go though in the second half Notre Dame has opened up a 14point lead It was Braden Shrewsbury with the three off the Marcus Burton assist to get the music Irish to 58 points To Ron Simmons Thank you to all the veterans that are have are out there So we get to get back to this basketball game Absolutely Back in action here Harrelson laying it in Hes in double figures as Notre Dame is leading by 16 now Hes done a great job in the second half of getting to the paint Just different angles and really getting that spin move and using his body to be able to get through the defender Nearly ran through that pass defense Turner fires it over for Fster on the drive Blocked by Jai but a foul So those Jai wanted the block so bad but if he would just wait until the ball get got there instead of coming down on that one he had the block Just wait a couple of seconds and then he can go ahead and throw it to the other end or throw it to the 10th row wherever you want to throw it but just wait until that offensive player releases the basketball And just one block on the season coming into this game looking for his second He was hungry for that one Fster has been quiet tonight Thats his ninth point looking for 10 now Four of 12 from the field and 0 for three from three Played 30 minutes tonight for the Panthers as he cuts the lead down to 14 East Illinois with just a little bit of pressure Just fullourt pressure get Notre Dame later in the shot clock to be able to start their offense Harrelson working on Jacobe Swings it out Shrewberry takes a screen from Jai Burton and its a foul A good job by Burton of just reading that screen finding finding an angle again as Notre Dames getting patiently to get be able to find that way to be able to attack in the lane finding the right matchups there done a really good job this second half of continuing to attack the paint So two free throws coming for Marcus Burton Hits the first and hes working on an 18point night Leading scorer for Notre Dame and and Burton with 18 Notre Dame with is a plus 10 points in the paint Theyve got 26 points in the paint Eastern Illinois has got 16 points in the paint Theyve also like we mentioned a minute ago shot eight more free throws than the Panthers nine now with the burden Third return a little bit of pressure themselves Mei White up the floor quickly for Eastern Illinois Figure if theyre going to make a move its got to be soon Turner pump fake cheering and threw it away off the hands of Fster Much better job by Notre Dame early in the game when Eastern Illinois was setting an offball screen They were hitting shoulders Now Shrewberry there on that one gets over the top Doesnt give the defender shoulders be being able to be in space Takes them out of that offensive rhythm Really good job by Notre Dame here in the second half defensively Sixth turnover of the half for Eastern Illinois Harrelson again Its been the engine for Notre Dame in this second half Nice pass to Burton underneath but it was good defense from Fster to prevent him from getting a shot up Crossover now Tough shot man Difficult from Burton Very tough shot but he finds his space finds a way to attack Getting a little later in that shot clock 30 points in the paint here 21 points for the point guard for Notre Dame Now theyve got Turner right side Whips it over Fster unable to answer with a three Tip goes up and over the backboard and it will be Notre Dame basketball Eastern Illinois one of their last nine from the field They have not made a field goal in almost 6 minutes And Notre Dame has just guarded Theyve impacted the ball Theyve impacted being able to read those screens Theyve talked better defensively Harelson backing his way in once again spinning and scoring And and hes a willing passer so theyre not helping on him Theyre not just sending a double team because hes been a willing passer But a really good job there of just finding the tempo finding the rhythm Hes had a really good second half 13 points and hes not missed a shot Four of four for the freshman Jacobe now threw it out of bounds once again Its another turnover for Eastern Illinois as the Irish lead music by 20 Haroldson starting it off finds Sundra open for three He connects right off the bench N0 run for Notre Dame Theyve made their last five cheering Timeout Eastern Illinois Notre Dame leads by 23 Garrett Sundra outs in there They found ways to be able to get there on the post up but theyve just done a great job being patient in the second half finding a way to be able to get past that primary defender As they get past that primary defender either passing and then driving that close out and be able to be there Theyre doing a phenomenal job and then be able to get two feet in the paint Yeah Burton had the really tough jumper Youve got some easier jumpers that Harelsons been able to finish over smaller defenders and be able to make plays but theyve done a great job of just getting points in the paint and being patient here in the second half And then when theyve gotten the ball in the paint theyve been able to kick it out for threepointers as well Theyre now eight of 25 which is shockingly a lot better than they were in the first half In the first half it just didnt feel like they were getting paint touches and being able to get two feet in the paint for the kickouts They were they were shooting but really Eastern Illinois in the first half was forcing them to not be able to get there on drives not be able to get there on passes Meanwhile for Eastern Illinois Fster was fouled on his way up makes the first free throw And if youre coach Simmons here that timeout youre called youre youre trying to find a way for your team to find toughness on the road here Youre playing some really challenging ACC opponents He talked about shoot around You just want them to finish really well Harelson has the rebound This is characteristic in the out of conference for Eastern Illinois Last year they played Illinois and Indiana on the road in addition to taking Northwestern to overtime on the road This year theyll play Notre Dame in this game Kentucky Purdue and Iowa State So Marty Simmons a big believer in challenging his team in that out of conference slate and he is and when he they get to conference play and theyre playing teams theyre going to learn a lot Hes talking about teaching at at shootaround this morning Hes just talking about being able to teach his team the right habits the right activities the right things to be able to get there And you can see him now hes on the road He is up teaching nonstop And that is Marty Simmons I think every day when he wakes up Mohamd missing from the corner This is a team that is still learning and is still coming together Eight exjuko transfers three mid major transfers make up a roster thats comprised of 11 of them total So still time for this team to gel and grow as they work their way towards conference play Another foul on Notre Dame Mafio goes to the line for Eastern Illinois Speaking of characteristic this is what Eastern Illinois normally likes to do Notre Dames taken them out of their groove from the line I mean these are the ninth and tth free throws that the Panthers will attempt tonight Their first two games they shot over 30 free throws a game So way under that average tonight obviously they are And I I just think as as they look at drives and they execute their offense Theyre really good at screening really good at running their offense And they did that to start the game They had a lead They had the 10 lead changes for a time there And then you look at now and Notre Dame has picked up the defense And so for Eastern Illinois and coach Simmons youre just looking at executing that for 40 minutes They they did that for a stretch They did it to start the game here on the road Now youre looking to be able to build on that as the season goes And youre always teaching as a basketball coach Harlson finding Mohamd who passed up an open look Now theyve got Jai in the post banging spinning losing the ball Under 10 on the shot clock Burton downhill Oh he nearly threw that in And that would have been pretty impressive Shrewberry stopping pull up three Not that time cheering He was five of six from behind the line before that But that would have been a tough one That was a tough one A little shot fake Five by one dribble trying to shoot a pull up there Here comes Carson Tout back into the game for Notre Dame playing with four fouls as Eastern Illinois heads back to the line So three consecutive possessions with free throws for the Panthers Both coaches both teams here you youre looking to finish this game well Youre looking to be able to execute your last three minutes Notre Dame up 20 being able to execute well Eastern Illinois down 20 trying to execute well And I think right now these possessions because its so early in the season for both coaches its incredibly important Both of them are up Coach Shrewsbury is sending SL subs Hes making adjustments Coach Simmons is making adjustments Theyre still in a fullcourt press A little bit of soft pressure They are both teaching for the season here tonight Burton up the court quickly Notre Dame leads by 19 Off the screen from Tout finding Harelson A little bit of an awkward catch Hes on the drive now Working his way inside Tried to find IMS Pass was deflected Harelson was looking for that matchup Felt like he had an opportunity to be able to take his defender there Harelreelson looking finds Ims Five on the shot Spinning now and dropping it in off the glass Really good move Low shot clock from Logan Ives Harrelson takes it away and hes on the breakaway Euro step and finish 15 now for the freshman Really good stop Just go and take it all the way Great finish at the rim Heres a Lafoier to the corner Its Jacobe and he connects again Third threepoint make of the game I mean this is something to be able to build on for Jacobe Hes had a really good game on the road Hes made some nice shots made some nice plays Hes been patient He hasnt shot it for a little while and then knocks another one in Jacobe did not have a threepoint make this season coming into today and hes now three of seven So like you said Luke promising for Eastern Illinois as heres Burton in the post Tout another offensive rebound Shrewberry pays it off 18 now for the junior Shrewsbury is going to tout some lunch at some point in time for at least offensive rebound second chance threes Hes doing a fantastic job of just being able to knock it in Hes six of eight from three on the night Hes a guy Luke when he gets hot he gets supernova Good good finish there And I just think the touts ability to rebound It is really hard to guard threes off of an offensive rebound because youre looking for the rebound as a defender Youre looking for where its at And Shrewsberry is doing a great job of just relocating So his defender loses him after that offensive rebound Touts finding him multiple times and knocked in a number of shots on second chance Luke how many offensive rebounds do you think Carson Tout has in this game I I I think hes got all of them Uh in his opinion I think every shot that goes up he believes that its going to be there Eight would be the number of his 11 rebounds eight offensive So just really impressive stuff from the Northern Arizona transfer as Jacobe hits again Four of eight from three for him as hes up to 20 points Logan IMS gingerly down the court for Notre Dame Hell get a sub in for him as he moves toward the bench Notre Dame can run out the clock here on this possession and and the way that tout rebounds its like another offensive weapon Its not a play you need to run right Its you cant scout You cant run hey theyre going to run this play You can do it scouting report with personnel but at some point in time Carson Touts just creating multiple extra possessions All of a sudden youve got eight extra possessions because of eight offensive rebounds You get eight more shots You get eight more opportunities And if you get that many opportunities over the course of a game you just got more opportunities to win really good job by Notre Dame here in the second half Im not sure what coach Shrewsbury talked about at halftime but he may want to hang on to that one because he did a phenomenal job of adjusting the effort the energy and being able to execute in the second half Great job by Eastern Illinois Couldnt be able to hang with them the entire game but really good job of executing and sticking to their identity early in the season with a lot of transfers Marty Simmons has to like what
