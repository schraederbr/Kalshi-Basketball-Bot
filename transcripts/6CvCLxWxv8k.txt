in the freegames Ted Valentine Leslie Jones Kellen Miller are the officials and Virginia will control to begin Cavaliers at five and four the four losses through nine games the most by Virginia since Tony Bennetts first season you know Anish I expect Virginia to try to establish some inside presence they need Buchanan and S Saunders to play better than they did against SMU and you can see right there they tried to go high low and try to establish Saunders in the paint if theyre not better than they were on Saturday versus SMU it can be a long evening tonight and a long ACC season no doubt for bethon cookman bran Freeman is their leading score hes gone for 20 plus in four of his last five Reggie Ward coming off backto back double doubles and that was their second leading score trade Thomas bit of a unorthodox shot for Virginia roie gets the start at point guard for the injured Ames Isaac MCN their leading score and Buchanan denied at the rim and you can see Virginias trying to establish the front Court presence they need that I mean Coach Ron Sanchez discussed that theyve got to get those guys better theyve got to get playing better more production out of them how about bethon cookman going right at that Virginia front Court Daniel rosan you mentioned in shoot around you like his back to the basket game yeah you can see right there with rosan hes a guy thats an undersized four five 54 he can play different positions in the front court but hes got a unique game and he you can throw to him at the Block and he can get you a bucket look for them to try to do that you can see them try to throw inside and then turnover which has been a Virginia problem this season Freeman nearly traveled hes a dynamic guard but he stepped out of B Ron Sanchez the interim head coach for Virginia he took over after Tony Bennett announced his retirement right before the season former head coach at Charlotte and a longtime Tony Bennett Lieutenant here in Charlottesville couple of things are different mostly its the same system were used to seeing yes absolutely and uh you can see there the dump down from from uh Murray into uh wanan there but let me just tell you this on Ron Sanchez its not it was not an easy situation for him to step in he wasnt expecting that to hes been a very successful head coach when he was at Charlotte hes one of the alltime great guys in the profession hes a really good coach and look they just got to keep getting better when a when the as they continue to progress in ACC play rosan left it way short off the second opportunity and you can see right here they theyre trying to establish the pick and roll game but theyre trying to go inside I think I think the first three possessions they have tried to either get it to Saunders or Buchanan either from high low or or side pick and roll basketball theyre they need to establish a front Court presence Brody contested no good battle for the board won by bethon cookman wild cats have not been a very good rebounding team through their first eight games Freeman nearly lost it hes on his fourth School in four years which is the norm in this day and age with the transfer portal is three no good battle for the rebound we get a whistle itll be Virginia Applause ball Reggie Theus is the head coach at bethon cookman former NBA Allstar he coached in the NBA with the Kings coached in the gleague heck he even played a coach on TV you say hes the coach hes also the athletic director what a boss youre Your Own Boss for being the head coach talking about no pressure and job security and hes a great guy hes been longtime coach as you mentioned uh played a long time in the NBA Credit to him for taking over both as the ad and the head basketball coach he was an incredible player at UNLV back in the 70s How about if they had nil back then for him oh he would have cleaned would have cleaned everything about him was Hollywood in his Heyday you can see Virginia is playing when they talk about the packline that hasnt changed from Tony Bennett the pack line is when youre in the pack line theyre trying to have one guy ball pressure and the other four guys inside the threepoint line to create a a a picture that its crowded for the ball handler that has not changed from Tony Bennett to Ron Sanchez Virginia five possessions three turnovers the three doesnt go for mcne 50 from three entering play and part of the offensive thing for Virginia theyve tried to stay with the blocker mover which is one guy screening on the weak side and on the ball side the other Postman posting up they call that the block remover which was kind of invented from Dick Bennett rosan on the low post denied by Buchanon second effort and able to draw the foul on the sophomore from cordal Lane slow start successful and part of the reason they won a national championship as well too the issue is they dont have that right now in the in the in the guard play without especially without DayDay and so youre looking at as Ron Sanchez talked about kind of a threeheaded monster with roie McNeely and Sharma just trying to find guys to get the job done the biggest thing not turn the ball over now rosan misses both free throws the Manhattan Transfer Subs in for Virginia Jacob Kofi five in white freshman from Seattle hes had some bright moments roie from the outside doesnt go and the rebound snared away by rosan beun cookman early on you get the sense they feel like theyve got a Fighting Chance on the inside well I I think theyre going to really attack rosan and because of Reggie thes NBA background hes going to try to attack different matchups and right here inside with rosan that went right inside out but you can continue to see Reggie Theus on bethon cookman attack different guys on the on the weakest match up that they feel that they had the advantage of and one of them obviously from the start of the game is on the in the inside part of the Interior defense if youre into real estate construction you like the start of this game both teams not hitting from the field Virginia one for six bethon cookman one for eight thats a lot of bricks to play with whats interesting for Beth cookman theyve been going underneath the screen meaning when the screens coming from Virginia theyre actually going underneath instead of over the top which allowed them to shoot the threepoint shot I dont know if thats by Design but its been working at this point cuz they have not made him pay Virginia how about the three By Reggie Ward the senior from Chicago coming off back to back double doubles he can play multiple positions hes a hard matchup can play three or four hes a scorer he can give problems you see them again trying to get inside there to try to establish with Saunders here Kofi tries the three doesnt get the bounce Josh thats a play where a good throw Saunders has an easy two meanwhile Freeman misses the pullup three forced it yeah I mean they had a good look there from Kofi they really like Kofi the Virginia staff hes a freshman though hell get better with time but hes going to hes going to have to make those right by the block there in the paint for them to be able to Virginia one for eight in the early going Ward out to Freeman Reggie Theus says pull it back look at the shot clock you can see again theyre going to try to attack matchups that is a big thing with Reggie Theus is trying to get matchups shot clock down to five facing up Ward no Kofi the rebound so for Virginia they didnt have a single field goal in the last 10 minutes against SMU almost s minutes into this one and just one field goal McNeely no good and listen the longer you let a team like bethon cookman hang around they then start to believe and theyve got a bunch of guys on team who are transfers who have played at the high major level W has a tripped and not only that you bu they build confidence they think hey we can win this game and as you mentioned theyve been multiple schools or an older team whats interesting is the cookmans going underneath if youve noticed again everythings going underneath and Virginia has not made them pay a sloppy start for Virginia it continues fourth turnover and we get a foul on the Cavaliers two things one is Virginias extremely lucky right now that bethume cookman has turned it over and has missed shots they could easily be down 10 or 12 right now because they have not played for well Virginia and neither is bethon cookman and secondly with Freeman with on on beum cookman hes going to take rayon Freeman hes going to take some kind of crazy shots theyre going to have because of his scoring ability and because naturally hes a two guard they put him at the point because of some injuries theyre going to let him take some wild shots here and there but he has the ability that he can get hot and score in bunches he was a double digit score of both George Washington and Rhode Island Asus carero Martin 12 in Maroon camping out at the top of the arc heres Freeman catch release got it and this place is church quiet that might even be too loud I mean it is silence I think theyre a little shocked right now Virginias got to start theyre going to have to make some shots here beum cooking went over the top of the screen but again theyre trying to get back inside the Ganan to try to establish some points in the paint presence and theyre theyre right there at that front of that charge block Circle theyre just going to have to put the ball in the basket Anish theyve missed nine of their 10 field goals theyve struggled with turnovers Freeman down the lane through the trees blocked by Buchanan you can see right here be cook the NBA in the gleague in college and on TV hes Hollywood you remember the Saturday Morning Show hangtime at coach youve been a college basketball head coach given how long the college basketball season is to be head coach and athletic director well he talked about it first of all I know you like the jobs job security but I will say another turnover there by and Ro who started out as point guard for Virginia but thats been for Virginia but for regarding P being ad and the head basketball coach he talked about it coming in here he had five calls already today to put out some fires with other things of that has nothing to do with the the game or or the basketball team and so youre wearing multiple hats credit to him to be able to do that hes got a great just presence about him as you know even when we were talking to him in the shootaround hes got a real good calm personality hes a cool cat as I like to say hes been around a long time I used to remember in Saturday mornings watching hang time the Dearing tornadoes he was undefeated coaching the Dearing tornadoes back in the Hang Time era there in Saturday mornings great work by our Graphics team getting the Dearing tornadoes on the resume rainbow shot with a pot of gold at the end by Jesus carolo Martin Brad transfer who was at Missouri last year Campbell for four years before that theres just not a lot of energy right now by the by the fans by the pro by the team part of that is the amount of open shots theyve missed maybe Sharma here can knock it down but part of that is demoralizing and it sucks the life out of you and takes the energy out of you and its done it not only with the team but the building as well Martin again nothing there it is 10 to2 bethon cookman and got to give you an idea this wild cats team they played a home game against South Carolina State on November 16th that is their only true home game for the first two and a half months of the Season theyre in a stretch where theyre playing the fifth of 12 consecutive games away from home part of that is for financial reasons games like this its a money game but theyre battle tested they played Texas Tech Nebraska Minnesota already well theyre battle tested theyre Road tested we talked about with Coach Theus as well that hey you want to prove that you dont belong in Bon cookman but you belong in the ACC prove it heres a chance for you to prove it and to show that you can go play at this level so this gives him that motivation to do it with the shot clock winding down another Miss Buchanan and we get a foul Buchanan though below 50 from the line for his career you know the other thing when when Virginia gets down Anish an issue that theyve had has been because they play low possessions so because theyre a slower paced team and a low possession team if you get down too much theyre not a team thats going to play a high percentage of of of more possession possessions or repressing you or flying it up the floor so thats why getting down by two much for then early on its actually like double it if you when you really think about it based on the stats and thats something they got to be careful of and just trying to hang around it works both ways I know youve been on the other side where youre down seven or eight feels like 15 because they didnt turn it over and because of the slow possessions you dont get that and theyre playing late shot clock so you dont get that as many more possessions but the for them for this season theyve had an issue on the on the turnover side thats been a real issue with them one out of two for Buchanan Virginia one for 12 from the field five turnovers you see W play catch theyre trying to go inside to Roseanne there theyre trying to get it inside to him theres that big big double staple of the packline ward using that big 66 frame too strong and Buchanan there to clean they did not start doubling him at all to start the game theres another turnover by mcneel they again try to get it into Saunders there but going back to on the defensive side of the ball for Virginia they did not starting doubling on on on Roseanne you can see Reggie theia said hey Im going to go at him inside were going to establish him inside they came out of that timeout Virginia said we got to start doubling them tonight Virginia turning it over on 35 of its possessions more than 20 for the season near the bottom of division 1 and you mentioned last two years and really for the Tony Bennett era uh they were amongst the best at protecting the basketball we talked about it with Coach Sanchez again in the shoo round three things he mentioned and one of them he just was a stickler about is we cant turn the ball over I mean when you I dont care what sport it is Anish if you dont if you turn it over you give yourself a less chance to win if you dont turn it over and youre a little lesser talented you have a better chance hanging around and winning the game that has been a big problem for Virginia is a turnover issue because of their point guard play frean the great feed to khil CRA the D2 transfer from West Virginia state and its 123 bethon more than halfway through this opening half and Virginia still only has one field goal you can see right here again Freeman on the spin but the back door cut from the corner Corner Virginia got lost kind of ball watching and then ends up happening they end up getting a a back door layup on that now you can see here with with uh Virginia 23 power TJ power who highly highly recruited Prospect coming out of high school went to Duke was massach was Gatorade player of the year for the state of Massachusetts was one of the top was a fstar recruit he just has not played as well as his rankings I have seen him play I Rec SC him hard when I was at Georgia Tech this kid can play if he can get going he can be a Difference Maker for Virginia but he hasnt gotten going to this point he has been in a season long shooting slump Saunders on the follow officials letting them play and this one goes out of bounds and it belongs to bethon cookman I mean again theyve gotten good looks Virginia theyre just not putting the ball in the basket you know what its sometimes Anish its its an interesting dynamic in in in sports but especially basketball when that things going it just when its making shots it looks like you could be shooting standing on the pier shooting in the ocean and when its missing it it could be looked like youre trying to shoot a you know a basketball literally into a small uh cup and thats where it is with Virginia right now almost another near turnover off the defensive rebound how about that last 10 minutes against SMU Virginia 1 for n from the field first 10 minutes tonight 1 for 12 sha knocks down to three The Freshman from up north in Canada he played 15 minutes against SMU on Saturday and theyre going to ask him to do a little more with Day Day aims out well he was recruited for his shooting and theyre also going to play in at some point guard play so you see right now Ros out of the game so theyre going to use McNeely and Sharma as the point guard spots right now and if Sharma can open up and hit some threes that will open up the floor for Virginia Here Comes ward off the strong Drive using the glass beum cookman again trying to on a skit pass continue to attack the paint been an issue with Virginia is guarding the ball keeping the ball in front of you has been an issue All Season another turnover NE has been Mouse quiet here in this first half Virginias leading score only cavaliere averaging double figures and points Reggie Theus wants to slow Applause but again another turnover from Virginia they didnt get a shot attempt to even give him a chance on the offensive glass even if there was a miss and then here Reggie Theus as you mentioned coach Theus wanted to slow it down and try to get the match up that he wanted to attack Freeman out of control they got to put it up willby does offensive rebound rosan bodying inside tips it back Sharma retrieves Virginia was lucky there he missed that it was Point Blank for for rosan on the offensive rebound he just didnt finish it well so far this game has the FI of a third grader playing a recorder for the first time eight field goals nine turnovers now its 99 as Saunders gets inside and the front court for Virginia namely Saunders Buchanan The Freshman Kofi Ron Sanchez wants to see more from those big guys well one early in the game he tried to establish him at the Block also through side pick and rolls but hes also going to try to get him through the elbow and let him maybe attack some of withum cookmans players let him try to beat him off the bounce as he did this last play Sharma nearly coughed it up Saunders the San Diego State transfer charma is now running the point guard spot for Virginia heres power Corner three that doesnt go yanan another chance for Virginia Sharma open got it theyve been waiting on him 10 games into the season hes got a pair of Threes but credit to Buchanan on the on the weak side rebounding to give him a second chance on that thats the difference when you get a shot up and not turn it over and they get an offensive rebound the best time to get a three is off offensive rebound Big Time shot by Sharma he made Virginia a blue blood for that time period everyone talked about Duke in Carolina during that time period but the team that dominated the ACC was Virginia under Tony Bennett uh what was it like preparing for a Bennett coached Virginia team you just want to be able to score a point because their teams were so good defensively and you knew Anish that if you got down as we were discussing if you kind of got behind 10 points 10 seemed like 20 you know if youre down six it seemed like 12 because one they didnt turn it over and they played so slow in their pace and they were so good in transition defense but look he looks happy hes got I think some hes got a little less gray not uh not coaching right now he looks he looks good he looks happy that what happens you leave for a little bit you youre not youre not decided by these type of games youre under your your this pit in your stomach if he was on the sidelines being down three right now meanwhile Isaac mcne to the bench with his second foul again theyre trying to get inside there to to rosan to try to really attack the inside play Martin over power who got a piece Anish I really think power is a ex factor for Virginia they need him to play at the level that hes capable of playing he just got to find his shot his rhythm and flow and energy hes a guy that can be a Difference Maker if he gets back to who he was in high school Music tane Murray made his first start of the Season today Saunders 3 rattles out power fouled on the offensive rebound its the first on Applause Music rosan Saturday afternoons ACC Network mens basketball double header begins with old rivals Syracuse into Georgetown meeting for the 100th time then Florida State will take on to Lane in the second game of the auton nation orange bow classic in Sunrise nine points now for Sharma and without him boy you dont want to think about where Virginia would be in this first half no I mean he Big Time shot and again offensive rebound on the Miss shot by Saunders Powers got the offensive rebound they called a foul so it gave him a second chance out of that out of bounds to be able to score three if youre not shooting the ball well best chance to give yourself dont turnover and also be on the offensive class Freeman the answer and outstanding ball reversal after the double in the post you know and we talked about it with Coach Theus beum cookman has not been a good rebounding team Virginia is taking advantage of that on the offensive glass in this game to this point roie gets deep charma had the hot hand gives it up to Murray volleyball it comes to Seno Willoughby Joo transf Applause Music L than three minutes to go in this first half Freeman lot of dribbling terrific screen by rosan Willoughby everything but the basket now Freeman the teardrop offensive rebound rosan playing Bully ball down low the junior out of Las Vegas who who averaged 11 a game for the Manhattan Jaspers a year ago timeout Ron Sanchez thats not a typo at the bottom of your Music screen Virginia 5 of 22 bethon cookman 8 for 28 from the field and theyre in zone bth cookmans going to a two3 zone out of this time out and its a good call based on the way Virginia has shot the threepoint shot coach Theus is probably saying hey keep beside Sharma find him everyone else theyre not making shots so they went to the zone and it worked out again for the for beum cookman Virginia three of 15 now from three after the Saunders Miss 39 as a team entering play theres that big big double staple of the pack line theres the reversal Freeman little hesitation got fake got Murray in the air rebound Buchanan now isan Sharma The Freshman from Canada careerhigh nine points in this first half hes been the offense roie on the drive by well Freeman had he should have shot his first shot he he he took an extra dribble held on the ball too long made it a more difficult shot than he needed to be but because of that they had to get back into their manto man not into the zone and then they werent good in transition which allowed Ro to get the uh free layup to the rim Ward saw the mismatch with Sharma guarding him and took it to the basket just couldnt finish Saunders setting the screen for roie teams have been playing off Buchanan of late not a threat from the outside roie almost turned it over using that 66 BR over the 62 Freeman so Virginia right there they went into their ball screen continuity what is that that means one Bigs High one Bigs low and the big thats high reverses it and sets to it goes to a ball screen and then the other big with lift so they kind of on an opposite uh uh tandem on in that in a sense on that and what thats done is has allowed to try to throw it into big cannon on the slip but credit to roie keeping his footwork and his feet down go back inside the rosean there for the cooking but Ro kept his foot down pivot feet played off at two and made a good basket for Virginia and Virginia can hold for Music one the Cavaliers have not LED tonight against a two and six team out of the swack stolen away by Freeman then he has it knocked away loose ball rosan up ahead Freeman Murray cant get there in the basket good time expires in the first half little acting job by Freeman going off the court as he bumped into bu Canon but first four minutes of the half could be this has worked playing through rosan ran out of space good ball movement Freeman with the shot clock winding down through the contact and hes got 10 hes the teams leading score 16 and a half a game they played through rosan to start the start the start of the second half just like they did to start the first half they came with the double kicked it out Freeman with the attack long two saw wers no and again Virginias front court has been lacking the last couple of games heres the Hampton transfer Trey Thomas teams second leading scorer good position rosan Martin played at Missouri last year and we get a blocking foul on Virginia well again on the double credit to rosan to find the open man on the weak side the weak side which is that weak side slot and instead of the shot Freeman threw the one more and then they didnt settle for the three they re attacked the close out the hardest thing to guard in basketball is that close out the long close out coming from the paint to the threepoint line and he drove them and they get the foul called now hes to the free throw line Jesus galero Martin gets the first Sunday afternoon its ACC womens basketball Miami will take on pit then a 25 match up at Carmichael Georgia Tech North Carolina Clemson Wake Forest to finish the day Mar go ahead Josh I was going to say this is not how Virginia wanted to start the second half this is no again as weve discussed based on their pace of play the more they get down it just becomes harder for them to get back into the game because thats just not their style and the tempo that they play with to be a high possession team theres mcne who did not a basket in the first half had a couple of early fouls Saunders has fouled on a catch first team foul on bethon Applause cookman I I would expect Virginia to try to get Sharma in here quickly because theyre going to need some shooting or some scoring and hes been the one guy thats been able to do that as we discussed at halftime heres the law Buchanan to Saunders and the big enter the chat that was a good play call by coach Sanchez there out of the base out of bounds they kind of call that special team situation how do you get some points in those special situations base out of bounds good call there by by Ron Sanchez and they got the bucket just what Virginia needed lets see if the Wildcats play through rosan again his ability in the post and to reverse the basketball has created chances here lot of dribbling by Thomas shot clock down to two and a travel out of this base out of bounds here the back screen no communication by Beth cookman when theres a back screen youve got to be able to communicate lack of communication allowed for the ALU pass there for the dunk plus no ball pressure on the passer got a free reign for the free look easy two points pathon cookman from Daytona Beach Florida McNeely with his first basket of the game his first two points of the evening and Virginia within three the Cavaliers have not LED tonight Reggie Ward powerful 66 senior out of Chicago down low to rosan directing traffic want space almost an armar and were going to get a foul its on the floor and its on Buchanan and thats his second down you can see there the initial catch an from rosant was in the long post you can see where hes catching it the long post is outside the the rain about 15 ft and then he just came and backed him down and they called to fou Buchanan he didnt use his arms not his chest good call Freeman from the outside left it Applause short Murray got the start today first of the season third of his career roie hes got size at 66 no DayDay aims for Virginia their normal point guard as Buchanan gets the follow Ames suffered an ankle sprain in the loss to SMU on Saturday only played Seven Minutes in that game we saw him a shoot around today did go through some drills but were told he was not going to suit up and he Music hasnt Here Comes Freeman hes got four 20point games out of control Ros stripped got it back bot a whistle this an this is what has got to happen for Virginia if theyre struggling to score from the shooting perimeter youve got to find ways on the offensive glass which theyve done a nice job this evening who can in there with two points be because of the offensive rebound second effort eight to shoot after Virginia touched it last rosan with the shot clock at five Thomas at two launches short rebound Buchanan huge possession here for Virginia they need to get the lead that has been a that is a big thing Virginia has not LED in this game theyve got to find a way to score to give them some confidence with the lead that will release some pressure for them and mcne told you he had the two fouls in the first half really hasnt been a factor and theyll get a foul on rosan banging with Buchanan in the post second foul on Buchanan or rather rosan the annual ACC huddle Bowl preview special tomorrow night 6 Eastern right here on accn theyll look at all the ACC teams playing in a bowl game plus theyll have a college football playoff bracket preview Clemson and SMU the ACC reps Clemson will take on Texas winner gets Arizona State SMU goes to Penn State winner will get boisey in the quarters Willoughby the basket and the foul and this bethon cookman Wildcats team refuses to go away you can see right here the turnover again which has been a problem for Virginia ready to take the lead they turn it over instead get an and one opportunity for bathum cookman for they still have the lead yeah absolutely thats why I talked about that last possession was so important for Virginia to try to score to get the lead because they havent had the lead the entire game when youre sitting on Ron Sanchez in his shoes you can he feels it in his stomach the pit in his stomach you can feel the energy in the building it just continues to get everyone gets Tighter and Tighter whereas Reggie Theus is saying hey we just got to keep hanging around keep the lead theyll continue to get tight and then eventually well be able to pull away yeah and then you get the fans in this building getting flashbacks to Ferman and Applause UNBC this was they havent had a bad Loss Virginia on the resume if they were to lose this this would be a bad loss mcne ties it at 27 his first Triple A 50 threepoint shooter they need to get him going able to get off of a baseline screening action good position Down Low by Ward and if you notice again Reggie theat thats his thing is trying trying to attack the matchups and they saw the match up inside there in the overload with rosan get it inside there thats what hes known for with his NBA background yeah with 11 new players on this team Reggie the is telling us simplify has been one of the themes in this early part of the Year Kofi out to Saunders knocks down a three and Virginia has its first lead big to Big from Kofi the freshman and the block to Saunders up top thats a big basket for Saunders to kind of get going from the front Court this crowd has been waiting to cheer finally something to get excited about and now pon cookman turns it over mcneels pass knocked down gets it back Virginia will Applause settle the lob inside knocked away Mar it comes to Music Willoughby theyre trying to go high low there they just need to get enough air on the pass but again another turnover just its been the theme for Virginia this season has continued in this game with a turnover problem Freeman not on the floor for bethon cookman they leading Applause score rosan no good the carum to ro without Freeman on the floorum cookman has trouble scoring late clock they dont hes their best playmaker to create their own Applause shot Kofi from Sharma freshman to freshman and Virginia extends to a threepoint lead how about Sharma freshman I hes been the MVP for Virginia in this game the reason theyre up three and even having a chance to be in the lead right now is because of the Freshman from Canada career high nine points three triples in the first half Ro fell down Wards pass knocked Away by Sharm hes been active hes been hes been good obviously on the offensive end but Ive been impressed by who whos been defensively just again hes maybe not the most athletic guy but hes been in the right spots hes doing a nice job even when theyre trying to post him hes fronting the post hes got hes got a good upside for for only being a fresh whether they can stay here who knows cuz of the poor portal but hes a goodlooking freshman well so much of the upside for Virginias season will depend on how far Sharma and Kofi come along especially once you get into conference play Oh Thomas Nifty move inside his first two points of the evening hes a fiery character we got to see him shoot around chirp a little Applause bit again you can see Virginia going back to the ball screen continuity one post low one post High looking high low into the reversal which ends in a ball screen Sharma off the shot fake thats a three no good follows his Miss theres tame Murray from the wing ball tipped Martin carals bethon can go back on top Virginia did not lead in the first half they started the game shooting one for 15 Cavaliers 12 of 26 Thomas out of control gives it up well yeah you can see right here with beum cookman on this drive action right here as theyre coming down just he he we call it Go and catch instead of catching and going he just goes as the balls coming to him and then he catches it which allows him to attack the attack the paint and Virginia not having that shot Blocker in the middle it doesnt create any fear of guys driving the ball that could be a of Greater concern once they really get into conference play McNeely that ball hit him in the face and Ted Valentine blows a whistle were going to get a foul on pathon cookman Virginia by one for to be really good at especially for as long as DayDay is going to be out Virginia you can tell missing DayDay the guy that can his own shot and get into pain and help trade for others roie is fouled and and if you notice right now Virginia this next two minutes is so important why Freeman for beum cookmans on the bench Ros Ons on the bench uh Wards on the bench their three best players are are not in the game Virginia has to capitalize right now and find a way to get to take advantage of those guys on the bench was 10 of 12 from the line entering play Sunday at 6 Eastern after our womens basketball triple header its the nothing but net crew thatll break down the day in the ACC highlights an analysis of every woms game and a look ahead to the best matchups coming up twopoint lead for Virginia 1140 to go second half run cookman led by three at the break the wildcat thats leg the entire first half Bon cookman picked to finish eighth and a 12 team swack two and six entering play but they have played a lot of power conference squads Nebraska Texas Tech Minnesota Willoughby hoists and hits and when shots like that go in you start to believe a little more you start to believe a little more you get a little more confid especially when your three best players are on the bench for beum cookman Saunders now roie his pass tipped Saunders on the inside against anina Saunders back to the right hand on the follow and Ted Valentine says Applause foul I mean just right here with Willoughby and its late clock again he looks at the clock and Virginia goes underneath the screen Kofi got hit it was a bit got hit Saunders doesnt get up there to to take out the three and willby gets a clean look for the open three then hes pointing to his vein hey just you made the shot lets get a PL and play defense but I know thats the new deal now these days well me before we is that it I dont know if they do what they see in the NBA I get it and they may I I dont know if coach the did that back when he was playing I dont that was back of a thing back then Reggie had some swag oh he had a lot one out of two Martin carals the board Saunders against SMU was in foul trouble only scored three points 0 for six from the field hes got eight points today to go along with seven rebounds you Canon one rebound away from Music 10 DAV on Nina Trey Thomas gets the bounce ball bouncing the way of the wild cats sometimes its better to be lucky than Applause good this its this just not real good for Virginia those type of things and it gets you tighter right now you just become really start getting tight you can feel it and if youre bethon cookman youre thinking okay youre hanging on to the lead and youve got Freeman Ward rosan your best players on the pine and they hit backto back threes both of them late clock and then you can see right there just the ball got a friendly bounce going to the cookmans wave Thomas has scored in double figures and five straight scored 18 last time out against Minnesota 11 days ago mcneels been quiet tonight Saunders the aggressor lost the ball it will will stay with Virginia and you can see on the shot clock eight so they can really get a catch and shoot is all they can really do but even in these situations theyre now to put banan back in you got to look at the second shot for cookman going to be able to rebound the ball theyre going to get a quick catch and shoot Virginia right here they scored earlier in the in the uh in the in the second half on an out of bounds play see if they can do the same thing here another draw by coach Sanchez roie to inbound less than a second on the shot clock look for them to throw it right over to Applause Buchanan Ro the L Saunders the slam great misdirection play back screen action lack of communication by bethume cookman again special team situations Ron Sanchez has had two great calls on base out of bounds theyve gotten buckets thats Ted now for Saunders a team High Music Applause willough be to the Spaniard Martin hosting up Saunders lost it Ro leading the brick does Virginia push they had numbers Saunders has it knocked away and a foul on onina his seconded are you surprised that Reggie thev still hasnt brought in his reinforcements Off the Bench I am and you can see right here on this base out of bounds a great call you practice this for late Baseline out of bounds shot clock situations you can see where Saunders is at the top of your screen right now you think hes out of the play but he gets the back screen they fall asleep on him and a great pass as well too and now you can see bethume cookmans putting putting their their stars back in the game but on that late clock dunk by Saunders how about some energy by the crowd they got the crowd going they got some energy and gave them some life thats how great basketball is with the momentum how fast things can change the Saunders free throw ties the game at 37 substitutions for both teams Ward and rosan both low poost players coming back in for bethon cookman and I think for Coach Theus he was thinking let me give him a rest and let him go the rest of the game for these rest of this N9 minutes and try to find a way to get a win big offensive rebound Sharma for three four triples forap sh best chance to get a threepoint shot is off the offensive rebound the second chance they have really hurt pathum cookman in that area this evening ward off the skip pass air ball and you can feel the pendulum swing Roy contested and won you can see Freemans going back in but heres the thing Anish with that the the lob dunk for Saunders at the late shot clock base out of bounds and then the Miss free throw offensive rebound kick three to Sharma has given life to Virginia given life to the crowd and as you mention the swing of momentum has now all gone into Virginias way thats why the game of basketball is all about energy and the energy now has shifted all to the Cavaliers nine unanswered for Virginia Freeman back in there for Music bethon you can see just see by them scoring Virginias picked up their intensity defensively theyre more locked in spin cycle tipped out by Virginia 11 to shoot when youre scoring it gives you a lift on the defensive end when youre not its demoralizing can suck the life out of you can they get a stop here in this space out of bounds to keep the momentum going for Music Virginia Ward waiting for the double not there and he travel now you could see he was waiting for that help coming from another big it never did and he walked he was looking for it as you mentioned for the double so he can kick out and find the open man to get a Bass to to get a shot up and never came they didnt decide they decided not to double on him and he ended up losing his balance which resulted in the travel big possession here for Virginia can they extend this and get the shot and here go Sharma that was a heat check let it go a little too soon Virginia six of its last 11 from three after starting 0 for nine Thomas Ward likes this matchup you can see by the lack of movement by Thomas awkward looking shot and the and the lack of movement by bth cookman allows Virginia to be in those gaps that packline defense as we talked about earlier where theyre in the gaps pack line in the gaps more than 3 minutes since the wild cats last made a field goal Sharma a cofi and the bounce goes Virginias way plus the foul on Willoughby and a chance at a threepoint play wow thats a big time basket right there then you can see right here look at this pick and roll the find great catch but he gets the basket its better to be lucky than good we going we going we going we going we going all Music the difference starting off with that initial base out of bounds that gave him life point8 on the clock that got the dunk and those next three plays after that had given the lead that theyve been able to have right now its an 110 Virginia run and Jacob Kofi The Freshman from Seattle Virginia sports information director Eric Vader had a nice little line in the game note Seattles best Kofi okay I get it get it I get it yeah youre a West Coast guy yeah I understand it I dont know if everybody would understand that go to Seattle oh I get it yeah my wifes from Seattle okay so then you get it Here Comes Freeman big myth out there is its not Starbucks you can walk two blocks in any direction and find better coffee than the Big Chain Brands theres a lot of coffee opportunities in Seattle more than just Starbucks theres no doubt about that if you if you are addicted to coffee yes you Seattles the place to move to no doubt now you if you notice here because of their scoring over these last minute or two for Virginia you can see their defense is picked up and the pack line as we call it one guy pressuring the ball the other four inside the paint but its because theum cookmans not really moving its allowed him to really be in those gaps Ward banging lost it Sharma snatches it out of the air again without the player movement beum cookmans a lot of standing right now so its been in for Virginias favor because they can really play into the gaps and shape to the ball all five guys and now you expect Virginia to play into the shot clock Saunders shot fake Murray here we go shot clock at five tame Murray no good on the teardrop you talked about it earlier youre down nine against Virginia what does that feel like it feels like its you double at 18 and thats the way for them to get back is youve got to get stops and then go in transition and thats what theyve done one of the keys from Ron Sanchez we talked about can see here again Freeman here on the transition one of the three keys that we talked to Ron Sanchez before the game you can see again the transition defense was not set by Virginia he talked about being better on the glass taking care of the ball and weve got to be really good transition defense that was a breakdown right there they didnt get back and and build a wall which allowed Freeman to get to the to the rim now Freeman misses the free throw below 70 on the Applause season a dozen for Freeman he leads the wild cats and those are the keys those are the keys for Virginia not only for tonight but for the rest of the season turnover by Virginia theyre 11 Freeman accelerates thats the basket so Bron Freeman comes in scores a couple of quick ones and its now a twopossession game the one thing you cant do when you have the lead they let somebody hang back in is turn the ball over and thats those things because of a guy like Freeman who can score in bunches you got to be real careful sha tiptoes the end line mcney made contact with Thomas Saunders Cyclones inside for the two he got the beum cookman defender got chest to back to Saunders which did not allow enough space so he was able to spin off of it you when a guy got your back to you you have to give a little space so he cant spin he was able to feel that and had a great spin to the Baseline 13 points for Saunders who only had three against SMU but did go for 19 a careerhigh against Florida that shot not there McNeely the Applause rebound this is going to be a lesson here for Virginia 2 oh mcne not much of a factor teams in the ACC are going to try to take him away well the SMU you did that once day day went out in the second half they really pressed up against them and said were not going to even let you catch the ball were just not were going to make someone else score but a guy like Kofi whos come in as a freshman did a nice job in SMU on Saturday and has had a nice game this evening to both freshman him and Sharma and those two are going to have to continue to get better as they get into ACC play cuz theyre going to have to produce coming off the bench seven points s rebounds for Kofi layup way off and Virginia now with four minutes to go a ninepoint lead and you can see coach Sanchez calling sides sides is like the Mover blocker which is one post screening on the weak side one post screening on the b ball side you cannot leave mcne that open and Bon cookman almost paid for it theyve been fortunate for jinia to be up right now with McNeely not being scorer this game you know because they really need him to score for them to be good during ACC play shot clock inside of 10 Freeman against mcney Freeman Baseline no good Kofi skies for the board its just when Virginia in that pack line if you dont have some cutting and moving it allows him to really load up to the ball multiple guys to the ball and that makes it tough Freeman commits the foul it brings us to the under four media timeout Virginia with its largest lead of the Music night research give bethon cookman credit they were in this game most of the way and then Virginia used a little 120 Blitz to put some separation between the two here in the second half MCs free throw good the front end of a one and one and Virginia with its largest lead at 10 but there are still a lot of questions for Ron Sanchez and this team before they get into the meat of conference play yeah theres a lot of questions well first of all you got to give Sharma credit because without him Virginia would have been in real trouble in this game because mcne you know has not shot the ball well they didnt shoot the ball well from three other than sh Sharma so um thats one the second thing is I thought Saunders had a good game tonight and he needed to have a good game because between him and Buchanan one of those two has to produce for them if Virginias going to want to try to move up in the ladder of ACC play Saunders now a rebound shy of a double double its a Virginia team one and four on the season against Power Conference teams and the four losses have all been by double Applause digits great position Saunders Powers home for two good looking post seal there good looking pass credit to credit to Ron Sanchez you know hes very calm on the sidelines there his team never got probably I would have been going crazy hitting the scores table saying what are you guys doing he kept his composure the entire game and I think his players played off of that and he did a nice job calling the game especially out of those big plays base out of bounds in special team situations thats why we always made sure we had a camera on Coach Pastor good for television lot of Animation Kofi down low gets the friendly roll hes got nine to go along with eight rebounds well again their front Court was not good against SMU in their first ACC game it just they they werent and we talked about it theyve got to get production out of their front Court Kofi looked like he had some good minutes coming off the bench but if they can continue to have him produce Off the Bench and then getting good production from either banan or saunderson with Saunders thats a good sign for Virginia moving forward Virginia in the midst of a 224 run this was a 3734 game in favor of bethon cookman in the second half and and on one thing with bethon cookman I theyre going to give teams a problem theyre not theyre going to be better than fin pick being picked eth in their league and the reality for them games like this help themselves Scout your weaknesses and your strengths get Amplified and for teams in low majors and mid Majors your season essentially comes down to one week can you be playing your best ball during champ week and can you make that run in your conference tournament and get that one bid and thats why these type of games will help them and get better and obviously coach theas has been around a long time has been at the highest level willll have them ready and Le play trophy a little icing on the cake we get a timeout 30 seconds to go Virginia up by 18 another 130 run by the Cavaliers the show is out of Packers basement he went to the wrong house was halfway down the driveway of Packs neighbor no harm no foul no harm no foul is that the only show in the world that does it from the basement might be well there are others um but you find them on YouTube there good point ma the meatloaf yes yeah well no on you get the anonymous emails from no no one as famous as Mark Packer is doing anything from the basement other than Mark Packer and a turnover As Time expires Roberts missing the dunk Virginia pulls away 59 to 41 Cavaliers shoot
