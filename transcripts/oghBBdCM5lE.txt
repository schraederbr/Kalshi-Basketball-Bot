J Desi Tony Henderson crowd still filling in at Little John it should be a lot of fun electric crowds here for one of the best homecourt advantages in the United States and these 18th ranked Tigers win the tip coming off their first loss of the Season against Memphis that guy right there Ian shefflin has been phenomenal over the last five games Ian shefflin has come into a Zone and he and PJ Hall provide a formidable high low for the Clemson Tigers and Brad Brown chlin has been a monster on the glass as you see those starting lineups mcke mclen cash Ashby Albury Queens University of Charlotte this is their second season in D1 a dominant D2 program what a drive right to the rack for alberry the Junior from the Bahamas yeah Dayton alberry has onee speed really fast he gets up and down a dynamic talent for coach Leonard and Queens University both teams shoot the three ball Clemson one of the best in the ACC and in the country PJ Hall a dominant force is back to his old ways inside we see early on that Clemson has a size advantage and a strength Advantage they will pound it in the paint all night long 42 early Advantage Tigers 9 and one on the year the Royals 6 and seven coming off a loss to Mercer and which hedge coach Grant Leonard said the first half we just didnt adjust the D1 level it has been a different ball game since moving up here he said we cant take any possessions off but against a Clemson team tonight hes hoping that his team learns a few things as they get to move into conference play in just a couple of weeks yeah theres Grant Leonard right there and hes ushering this team into the division one era of course Bart Lundy was at queens before that very highly successful coach moved on to Milwaukee one of the contenders in the horizon Horizon League this Queens University out of Charlotte North Carolina this is really going to be a great basketball program for the a sun see PJ Hall knocked down the midrange jumper what a touch four early points Mark for PJ Hall what do you love most about his game I like his diversity he can score inside he can face up from the threepoint line hes very physical he likes contact he needs contact he finishes through contact and defensively hes a really good help Defender as you saw right there coming from the backside here is the head man for the Tigers Brad Brownell some thinking this could be the best team hes had in quite a while his 14th year and Brad told us look weve had some depth right now were playing without two of our best players and Alex hemway and Jack Clark but we like this group this group is mature and they stick together yeah if if if this Bunch gets healthy this is a final four type team late in the shot clock got to fire something away knocking it down was Chris Ashby one of the best Shooters in the Aon yeah hes on Pace to make 100 threes this season thats Elite third in the conference and threes made already here in this campaign Hunter right to the rack unimpeded they need more consistency from a guy like Chase Hunter all the talent in the world yeah Hunter is a guys thats very experienced been struggling lately maybe his offensive game will come together tonight chlan got a hand on it Hall had it deflected but it was out of bounds on the Tigers well Queens does such a good job of spacing the floor right there knocking down the three ball were going to see a lot of that they shoot 44 their shots from three and then Hunter so just kind of moves in right there to create contact and create the angle to the basket smart experienced play mclen firing away a royal seam who shoots better than 40 of their shots from Beyond The Arc Grant Leonard told us weve got to make 15 or 16 here tonight to have a chance yeah and theyre dangerous enough to do it the Tigers have made their first four field goals make it five now RJ Godfrey inside is I think hes the key to this team if he continues to develop as rangy as he is this team becomes not only just nationally ranked in top 15 could be in the top four or five three ball long in the corner there from mclen Godfrey foul trouble against Memphis over the weekend heres Wiggins he has shot the ball well over the last couple of games that man needs no introduction a sniper a sharpshooter jg3 Joe Gerard III boy can he flat shoot it transferring in from cuse Brad bra now loves the way he has fit into this team mcke open for three knocks it down for elite guard play from Kings we saw AJ mcke right there we saw Dayton alberry earlier they got guards can really play the the leader of this Royals team Gerard was feeling himself fired away from the top of the key could not connect heres cash good ball rotation open look not there for mck here the Tigers pushing it down the court foul Cs on Ashby hot Offensive start heres Little John tigers five Devastation to be on this floor his hard work paying off so well for Brad Brownell and the Clemson Tigers as he is the spiritual leader physical leader verbal leader of this team and an elite Star as only three players in the country lead their team in points per game at 20 points or more and in blocks and steals Arya he has overcome all obstacles to be on this floor be so Elite tonight no doubt foot surgeries kneecap dislocations basically back to back last year and so it took the entire first half a nonconference play for him to just to feel comfortable again but then he had a monster non uh schedule in a conference play getting into ACC but hes even better this year and hes just got a remarkable story well on his girlfriends father David Renwick passed away a year ago and it really affected he was he was PJ Halls second father took him a long time to come back but Brad Brownell really helped fill that void and PJ Hall is grateful for for his teammates for his coaches for leading him back to the floor and now hes having the best season of his career might be the player of the year in the country Brad Brown I talking more about PJ saying he just cares so much about Clemson he cares so much about this squad his teammates and thats what sticks out to me more than anything on top of being an incredible basketball player thats got a shot at the next level no doubt I asked him what he learned from overcoming all that adversity said stay the course and trust God theres a divine plan also we also o learned that he wants to be a major league pitcher someday Ill take him on my college baseball team right now said Im a righty Randy Johnson hes got four points tonight Clemson with a fivepoint Advantage Arya mudi Mark Adams our entire group here from Little John Gerard the Third how about that taking it to the basket for jg3 yeah Joe Gerard right there just used the defender when he can feel a defender on him he like a big post guy he can spin off and finish plays hes so smart with the basketball this is his 133rd consecutive start and near steel from Beetle Josh Beetle into the game the 63 sophomore from Columbia shot clock did not reset thrown off the rim and now the Tigers want to run in transition staying with it and putting it up and in it was RJ Godfrey Welly RJ Godfrey is he long a stick to of this there on that play as well for the offensive glass oh Ashby he can shoot it he can bomb it and he hits the triple they want him to get eight to 10 looks a night hes on Pace to do that and then some last season he hit at least one three in 27 of the 33 games Gerard little bit of contact didnt get the call and now heres the Royals down six into that short Baseline Corner got to be careful Pard the three catching nothing but air heads up play by Caleb Matthews to throw it off the Tigers watch what Joe Gerard does is he gets contact along the Baseline once he feels the defenders body right there just rolls right through it once he gets on the hip he knows he has leverage he stays low and drives it right to the rim just a cerebral point guard shooting guard understands how to play to make his teammates better and how to make plays himself 25 points earlier this season for Gerard on the road at pit a nice win for Clemson to start conference play there in early December what a pass a foul Cs on the Royals it was Dayton alur number 13 Albury played for AO power house down in Florida in Music Chipola matter fact they will actually give it to 32 it was Wilson Malcolm Wilson sevenfooter the first free throw is good transfer from Georgetown is Wilson theres one of Patrick Yings first recruits at Georgetown transferred to Queens University hes a guy that can really Chang the game for them defensively as he takes a blow now I like the way Godfreys playing early in this game hes just really attacking the rim the thing that Brad Brownell does so well and I I watched him at UNCC Wilmington as the head coach he went the NCA tournament two out of four years at right state where he went to the NCA tournament throughout of four years he Blends people together and puts people in the right place the right time based upon their talents they fill rolls under Brad Brownell Ashbys three now there rebound cleans up tigers Gerard on the attack no foul call give the block to Music Pard all the way himself par did everything but finish Clemson really wants to get out and go lay when this team is full bore with everybody healthy Clemson will be able to run everybody out of the out of the Arena especially if guys like Dylan Hunter get get into the scoring act Hunter the brother of Chase of course has been getting his minutes increased as mclen able to flip it in but you you talk about Clemson right Mark and a team that needs its depth to really step up here down the stretch as they get into ACC play yeah its Alec Henman an elite shooter an Indiana guy as PJ Hall knocks one down again hes so good in that 152t range all looked like he might have took a knee off the thigh he was grabbing it right after making the bucket didnt bother him there hall went up and rejected Albury itll be royals basketball on the other side Tigers so far in control first half from Clemson led by Grant Leonard has a lot of guys that they focus on in the Carolinas and a lot of kids that have won at the high school level good get good to get some winning pedigree into your your program you know in an environment where so many people are looking at the transfer portal coach Grant Leonard and Queens University theyre looking for the elite high school player that wins state championships and their roster is full of state championships this is the program shoots 44 of all their shots from three they average over 80 points a game Id want to play for Grant Leonard they get up and down and they play hard defensively he loves mantoman defense in your face good ball

positioning and hes headed to the charity strike hes just so strong leverages for his lower body so well right hand left hand he has such good footwork Brad Brownell does such a good job of teaching big guys how to use their feet how to G an advantage how to create angles to the Music rim hul now has seven coming up next well take you to purcel Pavilion in South Bend for Marcus Burton in Notre Dame hosting the Marist red foxes and Michael Shrewsberry is not happy he has challenged his team to step up and play the Fighting Irish way or get the heck out of the building thats pretty much what

got to be careful had one of the biggest shots in Queens history earlier this season against Gardner web game win in threepoint jumper how about that sweet stroke from Hall PJ Hall reminds me of Doug McDermot former National Player of the Year at kraton he plays a lot like Doug mcder I follow Doug throughout his four years playing for his dad Greg mcder at kraton when he played in The Old Missouri Valley and then moved on to the Big East this kid is a lot like him except bigger and stronger than Doug mcder little douge mcbuckets reference huh and heres some buckets right here that just quick turn quick decisions right there PJ Hall his career high was set earlier this season against all corn state had 29 well on his way with 12 of them already and plenty of game left arguably the best big man in the ACC Mr PJ Hall open three knocked down AJ mcke the leader of this Royals team you got to love the way Queens University has come out these Royals have come out fighting since that timeout

relationship between Brad Brownell and PJ Hall theyve been through a lot together and this kid plays as hard as anybody in the Country Coach having a guy like that how does that impact the rest of the roster it helps my next contract for sure and it helps the rest of the roster as well because guys are going to feed off of his emotion off of his confidence hes the most confident dude on the floor I watched Doug mcder carry Craton the national prominence and PJ Halls doing the same thing here in Clemson South Carolina mcke from three that dude could shoot it too oh my goodness mck now a nine has hit a trio of Music triples the Royals have hit their last four shots from the floor have heated up offensively and they get a stop yeah cash all the way count it and the Applause foul nice drive there from cash the Royals threatening to cut it it back into single Music digits welcome back to Clemson and Mark you look at this Tigers team and just how much better theyve been in nonconference play as opposed to last year PJ Hall has a lot to do with that but that is a Sterling net ranking and they have the biggest wins in the ACC all year yeah huge win at Alabama that win snapped Alabamas 19 game home winning streak and also its 18 game nonconference opponent home winning streak and that F right there PJ Hall has been the big reason why a lot of fans across the country and guys like me are talking about the Clemson Tigers as a possible National Championship Contender absolutely mark five wins against kenpom top 100 ranked teams The Comeback against South Carolina on this very Court they leave the country go to Toronto beat a really good TCU team the Bama game as youve already mentioned a Boise State team who I thinks going to make some noise out in the Mountain West again West is really good color of States unbelievable theyre really good so the Tigers have been kind of holding the candle in nonconference play for the ACC well take a look at the accs nonconference as a whole during our halftime break something you dont want to miss but how about the Tigers inside how about Godfrey now in the double figures were going to celebrate a little bit of Clemson Christmas here at halftime arent we absolutely travel there for the Royals mck Bing his foot How about if they get RJ Godfrey involved in the offense for the Tigers and thats the thing theyre getting him involved you know what hes getting himself involved by effort hes sprinting the floor hes settling in on the Block when Hall is not in the game hes doing a lot of little things to help this team win how about Gerard from his backside and it was Godfrey who now ties his career high in points with 12 an assist ass is is that how you spell it m looks shaking up just a little bit but how about the hustle here from jg3 Joe Dr just gets on the floor an assist in every way I mean quite literally arent you glad youre with me tonight Merry Christmas pal happy holay entertained at the very least this game has been entertaining a lot of offense the Tigers nearing a half century mark in the first half still 6 minutes and change shooting 68 from the floor how about that jumper seach well I like his activity level hes a got figuring out as he goes its a talented team I love the way they play chaplain has been huge for the Tigers this season Beetle Applause Godfrey heres Beetle straight away looking for an angle gets into the paint and threw it off the glass and in little old man game for Josh Beetle yeah that was the worst offensive possession for Clemson tonight ball never moved it was over dribbled but somehow Talent took over late in that possession Music beetles first points of the evening tigers have hit their last three shots right back to the rack that was Ashby yeah total miscommunication right there by the Clemson Music defense look how Clemson standing around theres no movement right now shaffin hook shot little turn around knocking a fall and the rebound to Albury it was poked out from behind by Hunter Music yeah jacobe seach going oneonone right there just taking right off the glass hes using his size over Joe Gerard II to just shoot over him its a nice job of recognizing the mismatch coming up with a Music deuce great pass ball movement the three not there it was Pard who got a good look Tigers leading by by 11 about The Confidence from Hall patience jumper rattles out well shefflin is really working hard on the offensive Class Credit Queens for blocking him off chein has just been gobbling rebounds this season top five in the ACC in rebounds per game George openen triple bricked it and itll be Clemson basketball number Music six turn from the Tigers number 21 chela Music Willams Tigers off to a 9 one start and Coach Memphis got him Brad Brownell admitted he said we were worn down by the end of the game he said their depth really got to us were down a couple of players right now with hemway and Clark and by the end of it PJ and Chef Ian sheflin they were just gassed Javon quinly is really an elite decisionmaking point guard late game situation the transfer from Alabama has made Memphis really dangerous thats another really good team has a chance to go a long ways in the NCA tournament Penny hardways group turned around a couple of days later and throttled Virginia yeah yeah that is a high quality deep basketball team in Bluff City right off of be Street Penny Hardway has built himself a roster that is athletic and long and that is a rabit crowd in Memphis Tennessee Gerard will have three free throws knocks the first two down an excellent free throw shooter is Gerard 90 on the year coming in top 10 in ACC history in free throw percentage number one JJ reck you heard of him yeah and this kids just a winner just like JJ reic he works so hard hes such a positive voice hes been through every game situation read screens so Music well hes got eight to go along with four rebounds into the passing Lane Hunter deflected it Gerard scooped it Hall three oh baby he knows it hes feeling good folks PJ Hall is in the zone was he fun to Applause watch CL wasting no time transition three Applause Gerard Joe Gerard shot that ball because he saw PJ Hall had offensive rebounding position and just let it Applause fly thats what the Royals want to do they want quick shots they want to get the pace into the mid 70s and low 80s for possessions but it has fed Clemson whose offense has been un stoppable in the first half as Wiggins his fouls got a player like PJ Hall it was just outstanding back here in Clemson the Tigers a lot of good decision making from a lot of veterans watch Joe Gerard here as hes viewing and checking out PJ Hall the reason hes doing that hes going to make a decision to shoot the three or put it inside freeze it right there as PJ hall now has offensive rebound position and so Joe Gerards going to go ahead and let it fly this is a lowrisk threepoint shot why because Joe Gerards shooting it and number two because PJ Hall was going to get the offensive rebound if he misses smart cerebral effort from Clemson Mark Gerard was a legend in the high school ranks in Upstate New York and you look at the numbers and what hes provided that portal has allowed Brad Brownell to go and get a seasoned player that is instant impact and he is meshed in so well with this Clemson Tigers team yeah hes a really good teammate for a guy thats scored 4700 points in high school yeah 4700 points in high school he is very unselfish and he has filled an unselfish role here at Music Clemson PJ Hall took Gerard under his wing when he got to Clemson they like to play a lot of golf Im told a great place to build chemistry and you can see it early the chemistry from Clemson has stood out through their first 11 games yeah this is is a brad Brownell Applause team rare turnover by the Tigers but theyll get it Applause back do want to remind you that Thursday bll Mania rolls on right here on accn with command center broadcast of the Bad Boy Mowers pin strip bowl at Yankee Stadium between Miami and ruter at 215 Eastern and the PopTarts bowl at 545 Eastern with NC State squaring off against Kansas State youll get multiple game angles with the real time player and team stats throughout both games oh oh and youll get a three right there from jg3 its in his name you got to deliver and Gerard has been phenomenal here tonight that one was shot from Delanica Georgia hold on that Music one M clar this team just keeps playing they do what they do what a feed slammed home by Applause Music Wiggins tigers by at 24 Wiggins at 19 against Memphis his career high seven rebounds to boot and Brad branell really likes the way Wiggins is evolving here for the Tigers just getting more confident great drive by McClaren hes a good little player isnt he yeah BJ McLaren again playing out of position hes become kind of a stretch forward thats had to turn into a five but so unselfish you seen sheflin how many times four different times look high low for an assist inside the cheffins a first Music Applause foul muren an excellent free throw shooter has missed just four free throw attempts All Season yeah hes really developed and his shooting touch has been so strong and they need him especially in the Atlantic Sun where they can go ahead and reverse the ball through him top of the key knock down to three Applause ball it feels like a matchup nightmare for the ason duny yeah he really does Hunter pull up Jay in and out tipped out by shefflin a warrior does all the little things right that leads to a second chance opportunity for Wiggins from Gerard little no look shovel pass inside that tigers have 60 points in the first half in counting Hunter nobody stopping him to the basket Clemson plays different when Chase hunters in the basketball game the ball never stalls it just flows theyve hit six to their last seven Mark theyre on a 20 to4 run over the last 3 minutes and change look its a few days before Christmas and the worst thing you want to have happen to you at home right before Christmas is lose this team has come back after the Memphis loss and look Memphis is really really good that was an elite atmosphere great players getting up and down Memphis was just too deep for Clemson but that wont last forever but this team look they share it so well this is a brad Brownell team Ive watched them throughout his career they share the ball they knock down the three ball they make threepoint shots I mean this team is so effective offensively their effective field goal percentage is 55 this is a team that offensively is hard to guard the big key for them to be elite eight final four National Championship is how well they get their depth back and how well they defend depth and defense are the keys to Clemsons success in March got to get hem inway and Clark back but no doubt youve got Stars youve got guys you trust Off the Bench the emergence of Wiggins could Godfree be a revelation nice pass inside sheflin thats easy youre not going to stop him and the Tigers they share the ball so well and they protect it just one turnover here in the first Music half what an outlet pass spin move Gerard in his bag sof him up Applause wow yeah threat is fouled Clemson 66 points the most first half points under Brad Brownell in his tenure as the Tigers headman they won at Alabama they won at pit and pit can score coach cable and the pit Panthers I think one of the most improved programs in the country over the last couple of Music years and this team has multiple weapons and this kid chefin inside you know as I watch their team play I think Ian shefflin is another guy hes like a big old Labrador Retriever just throw the ball out there and watch him go slobber on it hes going to go get it for you hes so good at loose balls hes so good at going getting 5050 balls off the glass that kid brings tremendous energy to this Clemson team and hes selfless I keep saying that over and over again about this team but thats what I observed in practice today thats what Ive seen studying this team hes got four points five rebounds and four assists shot clock off Tigers right before the buzzer Hunter steps into it yes wow wow the Tigers nearly put a 70 piece on Queens in the first first Music half a dominating performance speaking of pluses theres P J hall who has been nothing but a plus in the second half we promised you hes one of the best players in America well the ACC network has come through tonight Merry Christmas thats your present gang PJ Hall the most points in a first half of his career 36 combined between Hall and Gerard and they have shared the basketball oh so well the Clemson Tiger 69 total points not only is it the most under a brad Brownell Le tiger team it ties of the most ever in school history R Queens coming out with Dayton Albury knocking down a three right away but Joe Gerard theyre up by 33 he was plus 33 in the first half Ive never seen that before in plus minus Clemson responds with three of its own they like this Wiggins kid they think hes got a chance to really help the big three of the Tigers oh my goodness right back at you Ashby well Im sure that Grant Leonard expressed his displeasure but challenges team look we have nothing to lose here lets come out and play hard the second half and Ashby and Company right there Bryce CRA cash with the dunk queens has responded here coming out second half much better right right Music Applause Music done only second turnover of the game for Clemson Hunter free throw line active defense by the Royals Hunter staying with it be a tie up and a jump ball itll stay with Clemson now Brad Brownell is always challenging his team whether youre up by 33 or whatever the score is how can we get better thats the one question he asked time and time again regardless of situation how this team can get better is by showing maturity in the second half and not coming out and sleepwalking Gerards three carams out of bounds and Mark when you have a half like that which might be the best Tigers fan certainly weve seen from Clemson it does become a challenge to come out and regain that Focus you know if youre a fan right now youre saying well why does it matter why does it matter that Clemson come out and just Barry Queens here in the in the second half well think about Memphis up at halftime Clemson did not play well in the first four minutes at Memphis of that second they did not they did not play well in the first first four minutes second half at Memphis thats why this is important for fans players coaches that this team responds to start a second half the first Miss of the half for the Royals too many fans live in the moment coaches live in the future what does my team need to do to get better right now tomorrow the next day the next day cuz you got to get incrementally better every day even to get better 1 every day that means youre improving as you go through the season and you cant fall down in the second half of a game like this turnovers were an issue for the Tigers on the road against Memphis great Follow by Wiggins yeah you walk into the arena and you start checking out okay who who Glides like an NBA player chony Wiggins one of those guys that collides like an NBA Music player Corrals the board had Godfree available just a little late on the feed yeah bad pass Telegraph that did everything wrong cash hall went straight up with two hands itll stay with Music Queens yeah Chanty Wiggins little bit immature but hes starting to get physically tough ER been a little bit soft throughout his career but hes a huge guy hes got that unicorn effect in the game where he does a lot of different things with size muren hits the ninth three of the game for Queens Wiggins does have 11 points Mark had 15 against South Carolina 12 against pit we talked about the 19 against Memphis and Brad ronell told us hes just getting used to playing more minutes being relied upon for more usage yeah he just needs to be a regular guy in PJ Hall again just fights through contact brell taking a timeout after the bucket Halls got 22 and the Tigers routing Queens W taking on Miami and we cap the day with third ranked NC State and Virginia we wish everyone a Happy New Year Don hson and Tim Beret action there think about all of the great players as we look at the lay in there by by Queens number 13 Dayton Albury again think about all the great great coaches at Notre Dame in football with Frank lehe era Paran L Holtz you know who they got a statue of now as JY Knox it down muffett mcra how cool is that Legend how cool is that she deserves it too legendary successful coach at Notre Dame and Neil iys done a phenomenal job in relief hes a baseball term of muff and McGrath theyre N9 and one this year ranked in the top 15 Music n shot clock winding down okay you know Queens acts like they want to win the second half thats third playing line they want to win the second half they know this things over theyre not going to come back win this thing but they can win the second Music half strong post move from godre hell go to the line he during this nonconference portion of their schedule a lot more notable wins for them much better position here as they set themselves up for conference play yeah there you see those notable wins and thats why Clemson is the top ranked team in the a ACC regardless of poll that you look at and so why is Clemson so good number one theyre unselfish they lead the ACC and assist a turnover ratio they they throw 16 assist every turnover thats really really good they shoot almost 38 39 for threepointer thats number two in the league they make almost 10 threes per game 994 thats also number two in the league and then effectively because they make so many threes and theyre so effici in the twopoint range because they have such good high low game with PJ Hall company they they shoot 55 effective field goal percentage which is also number two in the ACC thats why theyve been so successful they check a lot of boxes and after last year is that layup up and good for mcke they missed the NCAA tournament a lot of it had to do with nonconference strength of schedule rad Brownell said it he said it hurt it made us feel it we felt like we should be in we were good enough to be in the NCA tournament but it gave us a sense of urgency this year in nonconference play well the other thing too Arya is that the net is the primary technology that we use to evaluate teams and we dont even know how it works so how do you schedule who do you play when you you dont even know what the primary tool that the NCA uses to evaluate teams to sort them they say and you dont even know how it works because its top secret you know I dont like to coach with top secret being the key word when they decide whether or not if I make the NCA tournament and my guys make the NCA tournament youve got all the tear and the quads margin of Victory important within the formulas yeah the quad one and they got all these ALG special algorithms that Google made up look I love Google I search with Google every day I just dont want to search and find out whos making the NCA tournament with Google because those guys dont play basketball they make computers and stuff software Hunters free throw line jumper rims Applause out Corner three not there and Hunter thats a lazy pass thats just a bad Music pass Paul called for the foul as mcke drove him to the basket now this is Brad brownells best team they are unselfish they are talented and have talent from the threepoint line where theyre skilled and every guy knows their role thats what weve noticed here since we came here is that every guy has a role and they all fill their role and theyre all comfortable with the fact that PJ Hall is their best player even Joe Gerard who comes in as a highprofile transfer from Syracuse hes willing to defer his game to other guys on the floor to make them better maturity will do that as a group grows together yep and then you add a player like Gerard who has been in big situations played in NCAA tournaments under Jim beheim he has fit in so well but to your point theyre selfless as a group and when youre best player PJ Hall is so selfless it permeates the rest of the roster it really does and look Gerards hungry last couple years Syracuse didnt work out so well hes hungry to go to the NCA tournament hes hungry to win an NCA tournament and hes telling guys that every day hes playing the best basketball of his career here at Clemson what a tip in flying in was that Hunter who got a hand on it chlin was there as well it will be credited to Hunter now Gerard on the bench PJ Hall on the bench Godfree on the bench the one thing you dont want to do is get an injury now especially PJ Hall with stress fractures dislocated knees along with the personal loss that he felt back in in 2022 of his his girlfriends father who passed away who was highly influential in his life so hes a guy that physically keeping him healthy mentally its not a problem and he has such a great support system with his family with his friends with his coach that kids got his stuff Music together Dylan Hunter stepping into a three great Hustle lot of bodies flying to the Music deck you know AR I mentioned that this team plays different when Chase hunters in the game they they bring better energy the ball doesnt stalls we take a look at bodies flying everywh theres Chase hunter gets his hands on the ball theres brother Dylan Hunter giving it up and giving up some skin on the floor I love that squeak when skin hits the floor its one of my favorite things as a coach loose ball drill leaves skin on the floor lets get better today youre cringing right now you love it what are the players hey you know what they have an option they could go ahead and bandage up all the way up their legs and arms and everything else and comeing Ive had guys do that on the first day of practice me to loose ball drill I was about to hand our talent stats Karen the headset and walk out of here Mark I have a family get to get to for the holidays they would appreciate if you let me get to Applause them nothing better than guys getting on the floor for loose balls especially in a game like this where you saw all those blue jerseys from Queens getting down after on the loose ball theyre still playing hard no doubt for Grant Music Leonard they are you heard it at shoot around though Mark earlier this morning he said you cant take any possessions off at this Music level youre building culture right pillars to a program thats exactly right Ive been they done that Ive been in these these buy games cuz here heres the deal look Queen scheduled this game they take a bus over here they play Clemson you look at the Nifty passing inside another dunk for Clemson and you get paid 90000 100000 something like that Clemsons not going back to Queens to play the game and and youve got to come out of it not psychologically wounded and this teams working the second half just to get better get ready for the a sun The Royals are going to play Duke in their next game yeah so these will be their first and second official contest against ACC teams as members of the D1 Mark how hard is that youve been there to start those early years at a program when youre trying to build something yeah I actually went through that process of a D2 turning into D1 in Central Connecticut and and look theres a lot of growing pains and the other thing is youre going to take your team on the road for games like this where you get paid to get bruised up a little bit maybe even bruised up a lot and so you just got to play through it you got to play it four minutes at a time you got to play it a half at a time and just challenge your guys to not get down on themselves not get down on each other and just continue to play hard and Trust what youre doing but its very difficult Arya very difficult Grant Leonard told us he said that D2 you could just create angles with good coaching here its not that easy theres a talent component an athleticism component you do that by recruiting and in the portal and theres a big difference between division 2 talent division one Talent its just that simple well Clemsons got plenty of D1 Talent this might be Brad brownells best team Mark about this flush now wigans just so athletic sending it down all its all starting at 600 am eastern and runs every hour through 4 pm just our way of saying thanks to you now AR uh I bought this tie specifically for you tonight this is my candy cane strike tie and I bought it at JC pan by the way its a very high class its the only way place you can really get them and this tie was really important to me and so you text me earlier today and said you forgot your tie so we werent going to wear ties which really upset me so you know what I did I reached out to coach Brad Brownell asked him if he could provide a tie for you young Skywalker who forgot your tie that he could bring a tie for you tonight well then you found your tie and Brad was let off the hook and he text me back and told me what a great teammate I was for trying to cover for you on your tie however it had nothing to do with being a good good teammate it was all about me I wanted to wear my tie tonight it was that simple Mark all youve done is now my family is going to blow up the group chat and youre the best man I love they think they theyre going to actually think that I dont have the tie even though Im wearing it that is a beautiful tie thats not how family works its a beautiful time this is going to turn into a lecture by both parents at some point he found his time Mom and Dad he found his time I didnt need saving I plan for this time for two weeks now I bet you have I I have oh when you told me we werent wearing ties tonight it like blew my whole routine I was all jacked about my tie thank you for finding your tie but if it didnt happen we had Brad Brownell the head coach of Clemson I would have been an orange tie and you would have been accus be at a homer but it would have worked I wonder if thats the first time Brad Brownell would have ever had to provide Talent a tie yes he did mention that that it was but was more than happy to help us we got a review look it official review maybe an elbow High Music yeah so first thought that looks like a basketball play is coming through thats a basketball play now they may call it something else Ive been wrong on this before could be called a flagrant one but it looks like hes already through his motion the defender gets in inside of his little little Cube there inside of his space and so if it were up to me I would call play Music on so think about a player think that theyre inside a tube so flagrant one excessive and or unnecessary I dont think that was excessive number one and I also think that the defender moved inside that that tube that you have a right to as an offensive player and therefore caught one in the chops thats my EXP exp ERT opinion here but this expert has been wrong a lot so dont bet on me if youre on BET ESPN right now do not bet on Music me there Jamie lucky and Tony Henderson theyve gotten better at enforcing this rule or at least I should say interpreting flagrant ones and flagrant twos as opposed to Common fouls or just basketball plays early on when they implemented anything High yeah was going to be called and it was unfortunate you had players ejected for for maybe just misinterpretation or a tough interpretation uh that they were bound to by the rule book so continues to Music evolve just got an explanation so it stays as an offensive foul it is not a flager one foul and I am one for one tonight Mark that down please so ESPN bet can count on you or maybe not no maybe they dont want you to get it right no Music no 8956 the Tigers have been flexing their muscles one of the best teams in the country with one of the best players in the country PJ Hall count it hes got 24 hell go to the line he reminds me so much of Doug mcder this time coming off the dribble going up strong getting the contact MC durman did a really good job he averaged almost 27 points his senior year at kraton where he would invite contact and he would sell the contact and get to the line and I see PJ Hall doing a lot of the same things now he doesnt work as well without the balls mcder mcder was a master at moving off of screens without the basketball but theres a lot of similarities between those two MC 25 by the way mcms uh Jersey was just retired at CR just this past week big number three hangs in the rafters of Omaha one of the great father son Duos for kraton and in college basketball history no doubt well hall now with those 25 hes closing in on that career high of 29 22nd game of his career with at least 20 points and now four of his last six contests hes hit the 20point plateau yeah thats called dominating right there AR you hes so much fun to watch too isnt he I mean we obviously being court side weve watched him a lot on TV like everybody else but getting to see him in person tonight has really been a treat to keep my eye on conference play as the shot clock winding down got to get something up great defense from Clemson but an offensive rebound a rare offensive board and a rare offensive stick back given up by Clemson but this Tigers team is no doubt going to be challenged in conference plate you got teams that are going to have video Scouting Report to take away PJ Hall how they respond how PJ response will be key to their season North Carolina and Duke as we mentioned at halftime some huge wins for them on December 20th but this is a league where Clemson this year has gotten old and experienced and good yeah PJ Hall just pushed is right through that that on ball screen thats a little too much its the second foul on Hall you talk about players at Clemson like Blossom game Booker Grandam McDaniels Hunter Tyson recent Halls up there yeah for sure he could end up being the best of the bunch yeah PJ Hall of Fame I like what you did there definitely on his way to Clemson basketball and Athletics Hall of Fame the PJ might have more than that in store for him you know a big picture in the ACC I mean Damon stanmire with Georgia Tech I watched them the other night last night as a matter of fact theyve got a really nice win over Mississippi State and Duke Miles Kelly really good player I mentioned pit earlier Blake hinsons the best offensive player in the league hes just extremely difficult to go over 20 points a game Music Jim L at Miami I love nor chadow Mir hes another guy I like PJ Hall that wanted to be a major league pitcher someday nor cedir if theres a rebound in the area he just goes and gets it 67 hes got the strongest hands in college basketball and Jim LGA is used to going to to to big big places in the NCA tournament wuga popular is phenomenal they added Matt Cleveland down there of course Nigel Pat comes back y Jims got a great team Lena has another final four caliber ball Club they had that big win against Kansas State in nonconference play were talking about nonconference resumee building wins for the ACC well and Clemson has Miami early on in the ACCC schedule that is that is a game as a fan you want to be at and if youre not there watch it on Music TV Hall confident hes got 27 Lefty righty doesnt matter with Music him that was the 34th triple attempted by the Royals theyve hit just 10 here tonight you know whos not missing though Mark PJ Hall yeah PJ Hall is not missing we talked about doggy mcbuckets PJ Hall of Fame here in Clemson with the left hand CLS been the building since 2017 and what is now a student recreation facility I was actually at that game in 1930 the first uh black and white you saw there was against Duke and the second one was against North Carolina thought I saw you yeah looked pretty good for a guy that old you look fantastic Mark Music Adams I will say that I was not of my parents likely had not met youre a lot of fun pars we had a good time today this has been fun by the way Clemson is a heck of a town this is a really neat Place beautiful facility at Little J renovated a few years back multiple clubs to enjoy snacks of beverage and BR Brownell might have his best team here this this Applause Music season Queens head coach Grant Leonard told us this is easily the type of team that makes a second weekend in the big dance yeah he said right away a sweet 16 team and look with the right draw in the right seed this team could really go a long long ways now who do I like for the national championship I like Houston Houstons been knocking on the door now they lost teren Arseno which is an offensive weapon but theyre so guard rich with Kelvin Samson that team look big 12 is going to be great Kansas really really good I love KJ Adams I think he brings a a little different Dynamic to that team everybody talked about Hunter Dickenson but I think KJ Adams is a guy that makes them athletically different but I do I like Houston I think that that teams been knocking on the door for several years now and I think Kelvin Samson is a a Hall of Fame coach a North Carolinian by the way from Penbrook who in the ACC Mark at this point in the season lot of time left has the best chance of making a final four making that run maybe a title well certainly this Clemson team from what Ive seen here today and and watching them play tonight and watching them studying their team as we weve come up for this game I mean I like their parts and pieces and how they play together and I think they have a really strong culture um I like the way Duke is progressing under John shy I I just feel like thats a team with Philip palsky and theres so many again a lot of weapons a lot of guys that you have to guard on that Music team Im just not sold on North Carolina yet just the ups and downs Im just not sold on North Carolina yet and theyll probably prove me wrong when it comes down to it you have a big man like that in Bott good guard Play Strong Wings getting Ingram and then I never count Jim L EG out of anything at Miami no and they have experience making a run yeah theyre old players theyre old BOS light up checking into into the game The Dutch International an energy guy transferred from UNC Greensboro in the home state of Queens University what do you think of queens and how they present some issues for the a sun its a team that by the way cant play in postseason basketball because of the transition from D2 to D1 theyve got to wait till the 26 27 season which drives me crazy look were letting players transfer one and two times multiple times and be eligible immediately but yet we have a universe thats made a commitment to division one and theyre in a great league in the a sun and they cant go to the NCA tournament that doesnt make any sense to me but Common Sense been thrown out the window a long time ago with the NCAA but look Eastern KY is really good aw Hamilton is a guy that I followed throughout his career just just tremendous AES of nose I think bman is always always really good I just think that theres play Such Great fundamental basketball under Scott Davenport and then I watched guy named Chaz lir the other night from North Florida who played like a pro thats going to be a fun lead to wat dunk City Forida Golf Coast going to be good again stepson Donnie Jones can flat out coach they went out and beat UCF earlier this year Donnie used to coach there Jaylen Blackman one of the most exciting offensive threats in the country Dylan Hunter getting the ninth three of the game for the Tigers and mck who can really fill up hes got 15 now I mention kenesa State and Antoine pway you mentioned earlier on Simeon CLE a guy for him that could can get up and down and score the Aon is a a league that its going to be fastpaced theyre about half that league is is inching toward 80 points a game theres another half the league that kind of plays down in the 60s but but I think its going to be a team of contrasting Styles but watching North Porter the other night man I love the way they play they just do their thing they jack up a lot of Threes as to a lot of teams in the a sun theyre all chased in Kennesaw States Crown from a year ago yeah and the owls almost knocked off Xavier in the first round of the NCAA tournament want to remind you that up next to purcel Pavilion we go Southbend Indiana Marcus Burton Notre Dame they host the meest red foxes its right after us Im going to be really interested to see how the Fighting Irish respond to their head coach Michael Shrewsberry who left nothing for guesss from his last media take on his team basically challenge youre either with us or youre youre youre not and if youre not get out of here thats pretty much what he Music Applause said well every player that has gotten into the game has scored for Clemson 102 points the most ever under Brad Brownell an offensive explosion here tonight right before the holiday break break yeah the first half 69 points and a 33point lead in the first half but right now look fact matter is Queens is winning the second half theyre up by one in the second half right now and thats what theyre playing for down 33 at half time now down Applause 32 Godfrey a new career high here tonight Wiggins an improving outside game that was front iron now the Royals who have outscored Clemson 3433 here in the second half just looking for something to build on as Mark said Grant Leonard telling us we have to win four minute increments thats how were judging things here tonight and were going to keep track of every media timeout pretty good second half for the royals here in well its the first time officially that queens has ever played Clemson but its the second time ever meeting at the Tigers the last in exhibition back in 2011 and queens assistant coach Dan Bailey very familiar playing in that game yeah Dan Bailey scored 18 points a game for Queens back then look this has been a highly successful division 2 program of national promin consistently going to the Elite 8 the sweet 16 the final four in NCA division 2 and Bailey one of those key components to the historic success of this program something Grant Leonard was extremely proud of for the Royals is that over the last 10 years when you look at all levels of basketball in the state of North Carolina queens has the second best winning percentage next to the Duke Blue Devils yeah think about that its impressive you talk about all the great basketball played in a Hoops crazy State yeah this this was a dominating division 2 program that decided to go division one and but theres going to be growing pains to come along with this but were seeing the fruits of these kids labor in the second half they played extremely well here in the second half three ball banged in there thats Beetle boy if they could get this kid yeah to give them something here as you enter conference plate youre really cooking with gas a dynamic open court score thats what he brings to the table and back to Queens they had 18 wins a season ago a pretty good debut at the division one level a great debut Id still be coaching if I had that debut Music one well Im glad youre sitting next to me here tonight Mark its been fun buddy from breakfast this morning all the way through the day weve had a really good time together and weve seen some unbelievable basketball tonight Dylan Hunter now with seven points his career high is nine that was his first career start last year against Georgia Tech you can count that and one his kids py mck yeah he really is I mean the guard play for this team thats what excites me as they go into conference play I mean AJ mcke hes the voice of this team hes a guy that really gets it hes an elite on ball Applause Defender hear that cheer and then Dayton Albury also another guy is going out of this game right now and and these fans are are cheering not only for the Clemson players coming out of the game but also the Queens players they they recognize this team as really competed well in the second half Andrew Latif going to get some burn Matt Kelly Daniel nasif and this is what queens has to look forward to coming up as we look at Clemsons first 18th ranked Tigers Radford you got one more thats going to be a trap game right after the break but then thats a heck of a first three games yeah at Miami North Carolina thats a heck of a way to open up Virginia Music Tech boy at Miami I tell you i Id PID money I wish I was Ill be in tane Ill be in New Orleans for Tan that night but I got to figure out what time that game is and when my game is cuz I want to watch that game Clemson at Miami pay money to see that one it was Miami who snapped Clemsons winning streak at home last year little bit of a rematch thatll be great guard play latte firing away this place would have erupted under two minutes to Music play these are some guys that dont get a whole lot of minutes but its important to execute here great pass good Music stuff Latif with the rebound Music Hunter yeah you can you can hear Brad Brown ello and keep moving keep Music moving back to the line for Music Beetle hes got a season height here tonight with eight points his career high is 10 against Florida State last season Music how you like to go to Clemson and play here against the top ranked team from the ACC and then your your prize for competing here in the second half is to go play Duke you see the queen players taking it in at shoot around this morning the arena theyre going to love Cameron indor Music thats a walk seach FR iron Wilson offensive rebound all seven foot of them theres a three thats threat 31point lead remember they were down 33 at the half this team just might win the second half and that is a huge win for Grant Leonard in his ball club now oh had a great look from the top of the key final few seconds steel Kelly oh couldnt lay it in but theres Latif and little John going to get an early Christmas present Applause yep an offensive explosion here for Clemson Queens wouldnt stop fighting a lot for the Royals to take in as they get to Aon play but its the Tigers most points ever under Brad Brownell this is a heck of a way to go into the holidays yeah Clemson was really fun to watch
