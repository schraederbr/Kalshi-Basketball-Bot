here for the semester Smith Joyner Marcel duwana and Gantt the front Court Joanna again held their own against Duke on Wednesday starting lineups presented by your local Toyota dealers MJ Collins makes his first career start tonight Mike young going a little bit smaller as opposed to starting the big man kid against Clemson on Wednesday here we go bazilly and dewana jumps Center wont pack ball play interesting environment you can feel the excitement here foreign Smith standing in the way and hes not going to hesitate we talked about in the opening thats one of the things that you see NC State come out with that full court pressure Smith is one of those guys again its got a nice rhythm going thats for cuevion 50th three of the Season he leads all ACC mens basketball players in that department heres bazilly driving ahead strips and stolen Smith looking up high for Joyner hanging in the air and throws it in and NC State picking up how they started out against two camps is that thats one of the things theyre gonna do theyre gonna try to create havoc and get you out of your comfort zone and get out in transition Applause lets see State LED 182 over two both teams started slowly offensively before the Wolfpack warmed up and they just played with such defensive intensity all game long against dude Kevin Keith said he thought it was arguably their best defensive performance since hes been the coach of the wolf pack five to shoot Collins on the drive gets it to go off the glass good Patience by Collins realize he had Joyner got him to the Lane pump faked him with either gather himself and Mike young if they said that the one of the things in that threegame losing streak they have to get back to the basics of passing the ball and not rushing their shots taking care of the ball has been an issue for the Hokies that are traditionally one of the top teams in the country in that area reaching foul going on Virginia Tech its on bazilly his first and quick substitution Here Comes Lynn kidding hes 15 we were here inside Castle Coliseum for shoot around midafternoon around 3 PM you could smell the popcorn popping even then Music gives it to Marcel and we talk a lot about Joyner Smith before sale is another one of those guys top five in the ACC with threepointers made this Wolfpack team is going to spread you out theyre going to penetrate and drive leave them open and they go knock down that three deflected by Smith off Maddox so says Jamal Spearman and the wolf pack off to a hot start three for three creating a turnover there and this is how they Thrive EV is being able to turn you over and get out in Fast Break lets talk about our keys to the game presented by your local Four dealers well we talked about fantasy State you need another Smith and Joyner encores they let Duke up in that win the other night and from Virginia Tech you got to pound the ball inside and take advantage especially when you got matchups you see DJ Burns come in no basket travel called before the hoop he shuffled his feet it was a good call from Bert Smith from his vantage point on the Baseline and heres the full court pressure of NC State Applause just did much at the elbow to the corner Collins Applause rising up for the rebound Smith feeling it oh my goodness and you tell me hes got a rhythm and today you see that last time NC State when they get a chance theyre getting in fast breaking that last time Justin Muntz was out on Smith theyve got to do a better job of getting back in transition defense because he gets going God help you see a turnover and another bucket by NC State thats five points for Marcel Smith has a quick six and its been a disastrous start for the Hokies here at home and thats one of the things thats played Virginia taking these last three losses is those turns typically theyre one of the better teams in the league and taking care of the ball but North Carolina state does a lot of trying to turn you over make you uncomfortable The Duel on top of the key he wont go Smith to Marcel Smith has two assists along with his two threes in the opening four minutes Burns coming off one of his best games of the Season overpowered kid but missed the shot numbers for the Hokies Collins and thats one of the things you want to do for Virginia Tech you want to get out and burns is one of those guys whoever you got the big you run rim to rim great pass from Collins you saw a kid finish at The Rim four minutes gone remember a few years ago Brian the wolf pack came here scored the first 10 points of the game Virginia Tech did come back to win but right now the pace favor is NC State because of what theyre doing is theres moving Virginia Tech and then theyre getting a chance to be able to put them on their heels Burns cant believe he missed it Jake Collins only played nine minutes the other night but hes been mighty involved early and Lynn Kidd as a reserve has two quick buckets and even though kids it came short oned it and you love the energy for kid being able to realize is that hey Im gonna go ahead and run right at The Rim Virginia Tech is being able to close out a little bit at the pace right now favors for North Carolina State Applause Smith over Madison key check moment Collins got taken out by his teammate but its still hockey ball Corner three manic shorty if youre Virginia Tech youve got to have a little bit more discipline because if you take quick shots thats that plays right into NC States hands with because they want to get out in transition Joyner wow again you see Joyner realize if hes got a big on him between he and Smith theyre going to dance because those guys are Ultra aggressive theyve got the green light you can tell right now those two are electric and started Maddox lost it on the way up itll stay with Virginia Tech but NC State is four of five from three in the opening five minutes here tonight in the pace his favorite NC State did come out and UC Smith said youre not going to guard me Ill knock it down and then Joanna said you know what dont let me come out of here I want to get into you see you back off on me its mine 16 is six wolf pack if you think your accident happened fast wait until you see how quickly the insurance company tries to avoid paying you get the strong arm call Attorney John Foye and Associates we know what your case is worth and we will buy 10 early on here at Castle Coliseum time to discover the best presented by the Fresh Markets or quavion Smith among the league leaders in many many categories and what that looks is me is the guy thats flat out a baller because you see what hes done hes come out and again has picked up where he left off in that Duke game right now Virginia Tech has got to recruit because Virginia Tech excuse me is basically having a hard time stopping NC State attack have gotten what they wanted so far really at both ends four out five to shoot Virginia Tech down because again NC State basically is getting what they want and beginning this half they have put until you take them all their news traveled again one thing the Hokies have done well so far is contained the big guy well and again since he is taken in from a hardship has been a fourth down low you see that they decide to come on that weak side with a doubles Applause so far just in months hasnt had a single attempt Music s looking for his offense rebound for DJ LJ Thomas in the game for NC State both packed with a win tonight we get back to the 500 Mark in the league oh great defense there butts got a piece of the shot and much is one of those guys that you can switch out on Smith with his Lynch and stay in front of him hes got enough to challenge that shot Marcel lost his balance deadly and kid throws it down great patient by Sean Purdue we talked with him earlier and he said that he was going to focus on getting his teammates a little bit more involved and then go for his offense you saw the breakdown in the nbm to give Lynn another uh finish at The Rim Lynn Kidd has only scored more than eight points one time all season hes got eight points Off the Bench with a ton of time to go tonight check out Padulas creation here and you see they may call that an ankle breaker you see medulla nice bass pass over the kid and again love the fact that Virginia Tech is being able to get back into this game under Couture out again his third straight game absent with that bruised elbow suffered up to BC Applause Music listen and not so much for just this threepoint shooting but hes one of the better defenders in that perimeter and his leadership ball handling too Ernest Ross oh rebound stolen by Thomas backing in nice put back by Thomas okay we talked about this pace for NC State and talking to Kevin Gates this is what he wants you to do he wants to make you uncomfortable he wants to be able to filter guys in and out he wants to push you outside and that allows you to get to your second and third option but Virginia Tech you got to be patient medulla versus Joyner medulla Now call Kevin Keats did not grow up too far from here in Virginia and he remembers his time at heart rate Military Academy coming to a lot of Virginia Tech football games he was telling me earlier about his memories watching Michael Vick next door at Lane Stadium and hes done an amazing job with this group of transfers hes been able to implement with the younger guys talk with him early one of the things they wanted to do is they wanted to get older but they wanted to get some beef down low and how well has jerk Hill Joyner fit in with tarkwavian Smith its been amazing so far those were the first free throws of the night for either side Applause or picked up the foul was his first ravion Smith on the bench so its joyners offense to run along with Casey Marcel stepped out of bounds pokies have weathered the initial storm after trailing by 11 back within six Applause foreign get them back into the game particularly Lynn Kidd who started here on Wednesday off the bench tonight immediate impact and it was his energy from the beginning being able to get some runs at The Rim knocking down that jump shot and just being the guy thats the right place at the right time the Virginia Tech was struggling he came off the bench and gave him a good solid eight points already perfect from the field four for four and three boards Junior from Gainesville Florida transferred from Clemson and how about the Clemson Tigers Brian Oliver they sit by themselves in first place in the ACC right now a week into January and before this game you and I watched it theres a game that went to the wire and then how about 100 Tyson I mean talk about a guy thats been balling hes been playing like a first team all AC Series so far right now its interesting to see where the league is and some of the teams that you did not expect to be at the top and found their way in early January what makes it fun those preseason predictions arent worth much John Camden is into the game for Virginia Tech as is Elijah Poteet out of bounds itll stay the same way it looks like Grandpa zilli ant to check down early play just two minutes coming back in he had an early foul replacing Poteet I think played 18 seconds Applause going to work kicks it out for bazilian you know this basically NC state has limited Virginia Tech to for one and done Virginia Tech focusing on getting back in transition because they know that wolf pack they want to get out and they want that pace big difference from the threepoint line tokis have missed all their shots both back now four for eight after that Miss from Greg Gantz not sure if thats the shot Kevin Keith wants in the offense well obviously and I think thats one of the things that the Virginia Tech youll give against that shot foreign ER Camden for three rebound for game one of the things youre seeing is that Virginia Tech not able to get those wide open threes most of those threes are contested unless you stay doing a good job as UC Joyner dancing solid defense by Darius Mattis Smith maybe want to dance with John Camden be careful what you wish for Music offensive rebound resets the shot clock Joyner nice move nicely done yeah thats a good move because if you saw that last time Jones is one of those guys that little bit put Maddox on a skateboard get into a spot getting that jump shot right in the midrange Applause Im not one as frequently with a skateboarding thing the silly getting to the freethrow line Applause theres coach Mike Young leader of the reigning ACC Champs and look theres certainly some symmetry between what happened at the start of last years ACC season and what this year has been pokeys hoping to change the narrative tonight but if I thought it interesting we talked with Coach young early you know he didnt have a sense of panic he said that you know they lost three you thought that a lot of it was them not taking care of the ball sometimes trying to do a little too much on offense that they need to get back to the basics and youve seen it you know Sean padulis come out trying to set up his teammates and get them rolling they have to be able to get some stops on one end and theyve got to be able to get to the second and third options on offense Music to go in the first half darkell joined her to the bench with two fouls Applause Music this kid is coming back for Virginia Tech kid eight points three rebounds in five minutes in his first stint and heres the thing from Virginia Tech when youve got Joyner on the bench now your focus is on one shot maker as far as Smith and you dont have to worry about two again a lot of attention can be played to tarkwavian Smith and now its going to if youre NC State take your time and make sure your spacing is right where he wants to go somehow that didnt go in and it got wedged for a Split Second and its a jump ball the arrow belongs to the Hokies Music how did that not go in well I wasnt a friendly bike but you love the fact that hes going to always give himself a chance with him being able to shoot the three and dance with the ball he can get into the lane currently were on the pace for the high 70s low 80s from NC States perspective Mike young said we got to keep this game in the 60s to have a chance kid into double figures already and weve talked about Lynn kid and him being available around the room but Sean Padula sticking to the script choosing to get his teammates involved talked about the fact that he hasnt really scratched yet but I love the fact hes taking his time and trying to break down the defense in his career to everyone else he had one shot of his career high already pretty good defense that time on burns Smith trying to contain Padula kick out bazilly deflected great defense by Gant on the closeout Music turn slip in the screen certainly got a size mismatch and he takes advantage and heres one of the things about birds is that he first is going to look at me a passer he talked him in in the absence of a horse has stepped up 13 almost 14 points a game shooting 64 and hes that option if they can throw the ball too in the post and go get a bucket Applause knew it was coming Applause Casey Morrison almost banked it in rebound deflected off Virginia Tech both back home and we talked about Burns and watch again being able to do a little Up and Under hes really crafty down there good kid up Up and Under and again if youre gonna allow him to go single coverage hes going to punish a big man thats where it shows hes able to give them 14 points a game yeah hes leading the or hes number two on the team and scoring an ACC play the leader is that guy Smith now has eight points in the half I mean when you look at this guy hes a three level type of score you shoot the three he can get to the basket his midrange game is always on point very hard to guard you got to stay on your toes and gardening how would you try to contain them how do we get into him I would get into him and try to deny him the ball because again away from the bucket he shows that hes got a smorgasbord amount of scoring abilities shot clock winding down basily cant connect how many times have you seen Virginia techie forced him shooting shots at the end of the shot clock he calls NC State is doing a good job of guarding those first and second options Ill answer your question with a question how often do you see the Hokies miss their first seven threes Burns another bucket timeout taken by Mike Young and again Burns is that God has come off the bench and say if you feed me I want to eat baby again give me the rock you know what a little mouse in the house action DJ Burns it stands Dead Leaves Great Lift on his shot and hes a bucket get it because again well put you on the skateboard Evan leftler hell never get the friendly roll both of these two guys have come out in this first half have been super aggressive already 15 of the wolf pack 26 points okay is he putting him on ice skates or is he putting them on a skateboard a skateboard is less stable because again the skateboard youre not gonna be able to recover as quickly okay I wouldnt know Applause have combined for 15 that matches what Virginia Tech has done as a team Joyner is on the bench with two fouls imagine if the Wolfpack can maintain their lead will see Joyner get a rest see him in the second half oh quick Camp nearly a steal pass on fadula the Oklahoma sophomore well get to the freethrow line and what youve seen is Sean Purdue will be able to take his time and get into the team for that defense NC state has done a good job though being able to Corral and get hands on and theyre active for Virginia Tech you got to find some way to kind of get some of these guys going but zilly has not been able to get going and we havent seen Justin must be able to establish himself early either theyre not going to give Padula free throws here ruling it a foul on the floor and the Edmond Oklahoma later disagrees Applause you see this penetration right here you see bethula go in and it seemed like they were telling me the foul was on the floor in the replay and see what theyre saying lets see if the pokies can get Darius Maddox going defended really well by Marcel in the perimeter and what youre noticing is that when the guards from Virginia Tech as you see her Caribbean and Smith go down good news for NC State as he popped back up numbers go for the Hokies much to the open Maddox three great recognition by month realizing that he could have gone and tried to power that in he had a wide open Darius Maddox wide open again maybe this will get them going but looked like it could have been a runaway by NC State Virginia Tech cutting that lead down to eight first three of the night for the Hokies Applause Music pass into a long range shot rebound for brazili Okies right now are seven of nine from two one of eight from three this is after they had their worst twopoint shooting percentage of the Mike young era against Clemson here on Wednesday godula comes up short may have been deflected Smith all the way no when he was fouled Applause and talk about the strongest in Virginia Tech and shooting the three ball a lot of it is that not getting any clean looks and again that last make you see in transition Justin must comes down realize hes got Darius Maddox wide open and thats the type of shot that you want if youre Virginia Tech and that other end and you see the Smithy and you see Smith going to the basket but zilly he seemed like he caught him across the head number two on Grant bazilly its free throw for Smith hes 15 one thing that was kind of hidden in the box score from NC States victory over Duke on Smith yeah he had 24 points 33 minutes he drew eight fouls from duke he was fouled eight times it was his second game in a row that he drew that many fouls but heres the thing we always highlight his shot making the building hes one of the guys its one of the top five in assist and when youre playing him you have to play him for not only the drive to score but the drive to be able to set his teammates up and hes done a good job of being able to get and draw that contact done everything well except shoot free throws he missed him both and Marcel has called for the foul done a good job on weak side all you gotta do is decide you got Luana sitting right behind you that if much gets by its got the other line of defense behind you Applause NC State for the most part has carried over its defensive intensity from Wednesday to tonight cant call for the foul impressive how Wolfpack have defended Justin butts which you realize is if you see a lot of their guards fighting over these screens you see Biggs on the help side and a lot of times you say you want to be aggressive NC state has come out and theyre making sure that they put a hand on all the bigs and they limit them getting to the positions they want to Padula in the lane scores you see right now Padula decided to pick up his offensive attack that last time being able to get into the lane create a little Separation by getting his shoulder into it interesting to see with this next five minutes left to go if he picks up his shots attempt shot attempts Applause yeah think about mutts not that he hasnt scored he said he hasnt taken a shot kid has half of the hokeys points cant right back to Smith on with a clock winding down put on the line no they call it a three you know a guy whos gonna make sure he gets his shot that guy right there he went from one side to the other and again talking about hunting shots realizing that hey I can get my shot he does that by getting the separation great elevation theyre going to review it initially tall to three I thought he had a foot on the line 12 points in the half but I like the fact that they gave him a chance to go oneonone with that length being able to turn over that right shoulder again Virginia Tech has found something getting the ball inside Applause kid has scored more points tonight than he scored in his first two seasons the college basketball each year he had single digits again not typically thought of as an offensive threat neither is duana for that matter but thats a Nifty finish you know big is going to always look out for each other one big to the other hes like hey man no look out for me and I got you on the back side things are going the wolf packs way if that hook shots going down Maddox dishes into the lane kid cant connect his first Miss of the night great recovery by dewana being able to get back the kid to challenge that shot Music is just so Herky jerky so quick medulla called for a block weve got a good one going here EV you know right now NC State will Packer up by 10 one of the guys responsible about that is that man looked like he was on the three but knocked it down lets go it is indeed a nine point game with 312 remaining in this first half pretty clear toe on the line but to quavion Smith still having a fine first half for NC State here in Blacksburg I mean hes already got 12 points and in it three steals to go with that as well 11 points now Brad oh you know what youre right Music well without limb Kidd where would this hokey team be well I think one of the things we talked about Sean Padula opting to try to get them involved but the guy that they got to get get going is Justin bus yeah I mean The Bigs from North Carolina State have done a good job of being able to defend him and not let him get to the spots and get to positions that he wants to Smith fouled all right foreign Music Smith out and maybe double him well T was a little late and what happens is they got like Smith hes gonna drag you out so far when hes occupying two guys Music time and practice yesterday working on defending these ball screens to stay out with Smiths unlimited range Applause Gantt hits the rebound for Marcel comes up short rebound finds Padula Marcel was wide open probably too old open medulla again has played every minute just about for Virginia Tech over the past couple weeks rebound popping around this ball controlled by Marcel four on four at this end right now otit and dwana catching up meanwhile Marcel comes up short by beg your pardon Pat Thomas from the corner Applause pokeys hanging around wolf pack have led by as many as 11 and look at how many wolf pack guys are in that lane when Justin Muntz is trying to go theyre literally sitting at three guys waiting on him to try to help thats why hes not able to get going you see Marcel come up with us with that steal s automatics to the dismay of hokey Nation Applause Virginia takes nautical and establish Justin must by throwing the ball in the post theyre gonna have to get him on some time across screen put him in the pick and roll and allow him to roll because every time he gets the ball in the post UC NC State normally have three guys waiting to come over and help Applause Music clavion Smith began the night as the second leading scorer in the ACC ENT with everyone else having already played if Smith gets 25 tonight hell be the leading scorer when the new Stats come out tomorrow I think we can count on that Burns couldnt connect rebound tipped out fresh clock for NC State Music hey I have this dance oh Mile and he looked over at Kevin keithy and Kevin Keith told me go get him and he was like you know what say less Padula hangs in the air unable to finish the acrobatic hanger final minute of the half Music Burns versus Poteet offensive foul number one on DJ and again Kevin Keith earlier toe Smith hey you know what go get a bucket he was like you know what give me a chance to get down there a little Up and Under thats what you call a finish and then you talk a little big on big after you see potique taking it right there between the numbers thats two big dudes going into death oh inbounds pass off maddoxs hand right back to the pack and again this is one of the things again that for North Carolina State they want to turn you over the points off for turnovers being able to put you in a situation where youre uncut uncomfortable Music turn over the half for the Hokies three of them have been charged to months Music count the bucket Casey Marcel extending the NC State lead an amazing drive by Marcel too so much attention on Smith you see him on the RIP Justin months is late didnt have his feet set and again you see much right there didnt have enough time to get set I know the Hokey faithful didnt agree with that but Im going to tell you thats an1 the transfer from UVA helped Tony Bennett get a bunch of wins congratulations to coach Bennett becoming the alltime wins leader in Virginia basketball history youre passing Terry Holland with the win over Syracuse this afternoon Marcel extends the lead to 14 largest to the half for the wolf pack the cell plan is 100th college basketball game of his career here tonight as he come a long way since matriculating from Charlottesville to Raleigh Music cadulla finish at The Rim be the final possession of the half if the wolf pack Want It That Way what a half for NC State on the road here in Blacksburg see Kevin Chiefs yelling at the guys and back away and allow Smith to cook over Camden comes up short rebound Maddox and its halftime wolf pack trying to make it five wins in their last six games theyre 111 when leading at the half this year and this is a team thats growing in confidence right now impressive first half ever trailed first half this is the largest lead and they begin the second half of the basketball I always look at the first five minutes of the second half of both team for NC State pretty much keep doing what youre doing you were able to ride it out with Raquel Joyner on the bench and from Virginia Tech you got to find a way to stop those guards and find a way to get some offense rollers Joiner on the bench with two fouls for the final 10 minutes or so that half comes up for the air ball to begin the second half 99 turnovers per game but in the last five Brian theyre averaging about 12 turnovers per game after it was about eight and a half for the first 10 games thats one of the things that Mike young was telling us is that they have to have to do a better job of I just think that theyve got to find a way to be able to establish their big guys you see three shot and a foul but cant on on Justin mutts from three okay Mike young stressing in practice yesterday that with the turnovers the Hokies were complicating winning right now you got to make it simpler take care of the ball well and I think that sometimes you may have guys trying to do a little too much if you see must knock down the first one but back to a guy like Justin musk if youre struggling you want to be able to see the ball go into the rim you want to be able to get a couple of ones to go to kind of get you into a little offensive Rhythm did you see him knocking down the second one as well Allen cant shoot the three months his first class of the night is it true that making free throws can make you feel more confident absolutely especially when youre not getting the touches its not like hes had a poor shooting first half he hasnt had a chance to get any open looks and you see that last time maybe coming out trying to be a little bit more aggressive and looking for his offense its all for one from the floor no free throw attempts in the first half back to an 11point game oh great Hands by mutts throws it ahead to Missouri a block from behind by Marcel how about the recovery by Marcel being able to take that move that open dunk from brazily second foul the half on NC State uh second of the half on Gantt thats his third of the game you see great defense by Justin musk coming up and then how about you see Grandpa silly up great vision to get it up and then before we buy for sale to be able to not get that easy basket away and theres the third foul the half called on the entry pass this ones on uh Joyner and thats his third and watch that block it was a clean block by Marcel so he thought he had an easy one three fouls 75 seconds nice option for brazily realized that he had oneonone coverage they werent sending a double being able to put dewana right there and again Virginia takes open up the beginning Ultra aggressive on both ends of the floor big 50 spurt from the Hokies Smith unable to silence the crowd but Marcel gets the rebound and he turns it over Justin Moss kicks it Vasily sees a little daylight its closed immediately much on the step back nice run by Virginia Tech again you can you can see that the bigs are taking a more of a conscious effort of trying to attack the band Kevin Gates goes to close this run down a little bit time up NC State at Hardees no matter what you choose its the right choice because our new rally sports South the network of your favorite teams have I told you Applause the gate being aggressive trying to put it out and it may not be beautiful but heres what Im gonna tell you 70 run is a 70 run you do what you got to do to try to get back in this game and you can tell right now Virginia Tech has come out early in the second half with a lot more energy than they close the first half with well see if they get Justin mutton hoot for that young mans birthday and Virginia Tech has won the hustle place to start this second half just over two minutes gone seven straight for Tech Marcel on the drive gets it to go nice move by Marcel realizing that hey Im going to set you up because you got an honor the fact that Im a threepoint shooter got down here with his right hand was able to finish round the rim were selling the double figures for the 11th time and 17 games this year time of his last six Tech getting Justin much more involved great hands though by great games more selling transition bucket and you saw Marcel ran right to that threepoint line if youre John Padula you got to understand who youre playing against you got to get out and challenge that he may not be wearing Virginias colors anymore but the Commonwealths Clash of the Casey Morrison 13 points back in Blacksburg mazzilli too strong and Smith all over the board about this answer quick 50 runs just from Marcel stretch it back to doubles digits Marcel going back to work by Maddox Applause Maddox after the great defense going to work from the other end and its stuck back in by months and thats where Justin must have stayed active and because again hes been the guy thats been on the recipient of the defense collapsing on the penetration hanging around the rim seven points five rebounds now in the game for months Applause uh chanting air ball as charquel Jones hes a confident shooter as you can tell hes got a certain bounce to his game and he wasnt worried about the crowds yelling or anything hes going to be able to get to his shot knock down that three veteran of 131 college basketball games including today Music three lost it recovered hits the diamond Collins love the fact that Grandpa zilli was able to stay calm realize the active hands were around him got the ball over to Collins four points for MJ Collins who made his first career start tonight back to Joyner lost the dribble now Smiths turn deep three a Joyner wasnt blocked out but he missed the putback Okies dodged a couple of bullets right there they have it theyve done a better job you see yet another turnover dude second and a half a half Marcel challenging much you see weve got a back and forth game right now both teams are trying to find some kind of momentum last time you see Grandpa silly scrambling hes mg mother Colin said help me out still got a 10point game Play Sports South presented by your local Ford dealer ACC OTA visit your local Toyota dealers today Toyota Lets Go Places buy CPI Security CPI home security that protects what matters most and by Continental Tire the smart choice in tires man that looks delicious a little pulled pork chips lets say Ive had a few days in Blacksburg through the womens game a good win for Kenny Brooks and the Hokies here on Thursday night had some good meals here in Blacksburg these past few days yeah that looked really tasty man the only thing I had was popcorn for much they make some of the best popcorn in the ACC here at Castle Coliseum Mike young approved all right Casey Marcel has been a Difference Maker today not only at the offensive end but remember the block he had in transition and heres the thing is that when you look at this Wolfpack team a lot of the attention on the perimeter goes to Smith and join them but Casey Marcel again the guy that can knock down the three and is one of the better perimeter Defenders and you see right now in the second half he has stepped up and filled that void for them Shooters bounce Marcels now the full packs leading scorer tonight at 15 thank you Tech opened this second half and a 70 spurt got it from 147 but NC State surging back to head by double digits Padula inching closer with a lefty Runner nice move by Padula being able to probe the defense again interesting to see if he decides to try to pick up his offense a little bit spend most of the first half as a facilitator just in the league and scoring you figure hell go for it eventually got six points so far Burns lost it NC State turns it over for the seventh time I encourage you to stick around for the fast break presented by your local Ford dealer it is coming up at some point here in the second half hes trailing by 10 Music our following that 70 run to open the second the second half Virginia Tech did a better job of being able to have their bigs attack the rim interesting to see if they go back to that foul Sean Smith its his first just thinking about the turning point to last years season for Virginia Tech and it really was that win in Tallahassee when Sean Padula had his Breakout game and look when youve lost three in a row youre looking to change the momentum what needs to happen to turn the tide here for the Hokies well I think a lot of it is North Carolina State and how theyve come out and been really aggressive and limited them to doing what they want to do you see great pass by Padula over the months but back to the point is that the teams that they have lost to Mike young talked about is that theyve gotten away from being patient this is one of the better teams of taking care of the ball and normally they shoot the ball really well from threepoint land they have not had that success and theyve had a really good scoring team in NC State today Mike young with several feet onto the floor marking in his team his first and you saw that last move by bazilly I like the fact of swinging the ball you got to shift the ball the defense left and right to be able to put the ball on the floor and be aggressive with the rim silly at the line hes now two for three from the strike and we pause for this quick message from Coyote Tractor from my experience if you work the land you got to be a jack of all trades you gotta have a little bit of optimism and a whole lot of getgo one for two for Vasily who had a huge game against NC State last year Wright State remember came to PNC and Brazilian 23 and 16 and a win for the Horizon League Squad possession nice curl action for equavion Smith you had him come from one side and curled to the basket number two on Maddox to the line all right Music what do you think about Smiths game hes become a much better playmaker for his teammates he and Joyner already see 16 games into the season have more assists this year than either of them had last year and heres what happens when you have guys like Smith they go through the pro the pro process you get evaluated and one of the things they wanted to see they loved his scoring ability but wanted to see if he can be more of a playmaker and thats what youre seeing a guy thats one of the Thompson Steals and one of the tops in the league in assists showing an allaround package foul on Marcel I believe as someone who watches a lot of NBA you cover the Hawks full time what do you think of jabion Smith is a Pro Prospect I think when we look at it hes a shot maker he can go and get his own shot he can shoot the three obviously hes super quick and hes active hes a guy that can defend on the ball and a very good play maker so I think that he will translate into a very good Pro Tula dishes but silly has not been his night from Deep hes over five but heres the thing and even though the silly did not like that I love the cut the action the back door play and again being able to get wide open shots is going to be critical for Virginia Tech Evie Duane got away with an offensive foul battling for position inside with bazilly keep an eye on that matchup though 10 to shoot over to Smith Gantt the screen Smith the drive blocked by Brazilian ticked out of bounds by Gantt pokeys basketball and youve realized that Virginia Tech has done a better job in how their guard and Joyner and Smith theyre extending off of those pick and rolls and trying to force them into the middle and have help they have not been able to get off and torture them like they have in the first half but now Virginia Techs got to do a better job of being able to find some points Sean Padulas averaging 397 minutes per game in this Hokies threegame stretch in which theyve lost three close ones who has played every minute again tonight sets up months for three rebounded by Joyner pokeys one for 12 from Beyond The Arc Brian and heres the thing is that they were forced into contested shots but theyre getting some wide open looks right now you see Applause draws contact on Marcel thatll be the third on Casey pokeys hanging around trying to claw their way back in front of a sellout crowd at Castle Music Music Music foreign six Central lets protect the paint brought to you by CPI Security and its been the points off of turnovers for North Carolina State already 14 points off of those turns and its been able to fuel them getting out in transition talk about they want to create havoc and this is what they do they turn you over able to capitalize on it they have active hands when theyre out get that theyre out running what theyll do is they wont settle early offenses allowed them to be able to get this lead and hold on to this lead again 14 points off of those turns yeah the difference in the game is NC State capitalizing off the Hokey miscues look at the forced turnovers are even points off turnovers is literally the difference in the game absolutely and again you saw Virginia Tech come out at the beginning of the second half seemed like they had that 70 run but since then North Carolina state has been ever recovering a lot of that has been Casey Marcel stepping up being able to buy them some more time foreign look at NC States resume right now theyre two and three in the league got the big win over Duke on Wednesday night and the early December losses at home to Pittsburgh at Miami they blew a big lead pit Miami two of the top teams in the league right now and the only team better than Pitt Miami is the team that NC State lost to on the road the Clemson Tigers so all three of their conference losses are the top three teams in the league and heres what I look at we talked about the fact out of their last six theyre five and one when you look at a team like that thats got two Dynamic scores of Smith enjoyment theyre a team thats going to turn you over theyre first in league as far as turnovers and how they beat Duke that shows that thats a team thats going to be very dangerous as long as they can stay healthy forced 22 Duke turnovers on Wednesday led to 31 points and DJ burns the big fella scores inside and oh yeah theyve got a big guy they can throw the ball and you see nice Applause Music first bucket for kid here in the second half hes got a careerhigh 14 points on the night seven of eight from the floor usually dont start a poster from the threepoint line but usually not dj Burns and heres the thing if youre laying kid you do not want to allow Burns to be able to get over to this left you can see his last time pass great read by Justin Muntz Lynn Kidd finishes at the rim and thats the offense that they want to get to but they have not been able to get it as frequently as they want kid just picked up the second foul its the third team foul on Virginia Tech NC States already at 17 thousand to have Burns does it again but heres the thing is that kid is allowing Burns to get to that left hand and hes taking his time and and basically pulling him down getting right over his right shoulder get it now every time it felt like Virginia Tech has made a player two to close the gap someone else steps up for NC State was on Marcel get back to back bucket now its Burns Padula finds some space not separation but were doing that last time he got get to be able to come a little off off center and again once you see the North Carolina State it seemed like theyre going to get some separation Virginia Tech finds a way to keep it close the Doula keeps his streak going hes been in double digits scoring wise every game this season Smith gives it to Joyner over Padula rebound for months again it feels like the momentum pendulum is swinging the Hokies way Maddox fakes it takes it Smith navigating through traffic all the way no rebound tipped out for Jordan Smith gets it back theres two traps that trip Im not sure if I like that shot by Smith you can get that anytime hes five for 17 tonight Brian two of nine from three three of eight from two Padula oh no whistle negates the kid Slam were fine not taking that foul you see the penetration medulla does a good job of being able to come out for months and you see Burns a little late reaches in right there but then you see again medulla back to the line Applause Music hope hes as close as they have been here in the second half theyve done a better job in how theyre defending Joyner and Smith right now if youre NC State run your sets keep the spacing youve proven that you can break down the guards on Virginia Tech anytime you want stolen by Padula numbers for the hoagies the doula Justin Moss foreign great recognition by a North Carolina state to get the ball inside the DJ Burns and let the big fella work and again wondering if your Virginia Tech do you send somebody because hes been able to score the last three touches hes had in the post and I cant wait to see that replay of that Justin mutts borrow what a finish Padula gets it right back from Poteet hits the Poteet roller Burns found him well call it our Coyote Tractor Turning Point Ryan Oliver check this out and you watch this deal by Sean Padula and decides to go then watch Justin months pulls that out of his pocket Evan left low and again watch him come back not get up on the play beat him is like yeah that was me in case you know let me hear it Music the best dunks Ive seen this year yeah that was a myth three on burns having to chat with veteran official Bert Smith Applause and we saw in the first half North Carolina State doing a job on Virginia Tech and turning them over and capitalizing in this last little Run Virginia Tech doing a better job of stifling North Carolina State and being able to turn into something positive on the LDN one for two for potique got ourselves a fivepoint game with eight and change to play absolutely and North Carolina States got to do a better job than being able to read how Virginia Tech is playing that pick and roll on Poteet bump and Smith about 30 feet from the bucket and if you pull teeth you have to be able to step out to stop if you dont want to have Joyner or Smith drag you out you cannot make that type of contact you want to be able to step out to hesitate and buy that guard enough time to recover foreign Smith doubled over to Gantt back outside Joyner makes a move on petulum fade away and how about the play by Joyner Rick realizes that he can get to the Lane once that separation gathers himself this guy has amazing lift on that jump shot what a way to be able to silence that momentum that Virginia Tech has and sharkell the fourth member of the wolf pack and double figures hunts tried to shovel it over to bazilly its going to be wolf pack ball Justin mutts bringing the crowd back into it here in Blacksburg Padula could not connect in transition but just in months acrobatic finish here at Castle Music its time for tonight he won the play wolf pack trying to win here at Castle Coliseum for the second consecutive year Brian a year ago each team won on the others home floor the Hokies one down in Raleigh yeah and you can tell this has been a game thats been back and forth for the most part its been all NC State but then as of late Virginia Tech doing a better job of how theyre defending and finding better ways to be able to get to the cup they still have not shot the ball well from behind the arc North Carolina State doing a good job of limiting him to only two for 13 now you said to Mike young youre two for 13 for three youre only down seven 7 41 left he probably sell okay rather be five of 14 but you know within Striking Distance and Sean Padulas picked up his offensive attack games you see right now they take doing a better job again they switched off matchup with Burns Skyhook there would have been nice if it went it didnt and the foul is on NC State two guys battling to begin their college basketball careers the Big South Conference and that may be four on burns yes it is you see both guys going after it you see kind of pull those dipping over look like a takedown that burns the wrestling mats have not been rolled out tonight here at Castle Applause High Point University in the Big South transferred to Delaware sat out of season had a great red shirt sophomore season then came to Virginia Tech and man what a revelation hes been winning the skip Prosser award last year combination of academics scholarship and athletic capability hes the whole package and you saw him just miss both of those interesting with burns out now that takes away the low post presence for NC State look for Smith and join him to pick up the offense join her to the bucket tipped out of bounds Pokeball get dewana back in the game and hes more of a rebounding and defensive presence Music plays full court pressure hope hes worked a lot on the Press break yesterday in practice the assistants saying theyre going to do this 20 possessions we cant turn it over one time in that pressure medulla gets it to go and heres the thing about Purdue that I like again we talked about the fact that in the first half were going to be more facilitator that last time he may have made a conscience having to put his head down put his shoulder into Smith and went right to the basket got 15 Gant will take it way short way short hard screen for months Padula attacks duana scant makes up for his bad three with a rebound dangerous pass work done Applause Music closing in on six minutes to play Music yeah NC States got a week off after today they take the floor at home against the Miami Hurricanes next Saturday clock winding down Joiner for three rebound battle facility falling over get to the Maddox Maddox waiting for some friends he was one on four who will the Hokies go to down by five Applause Maddox looking to create steps past Joyner good defense by Joyner he was able to keep Maddox right in front of him Applause see Mike young over there cheering his guys on Music origins in this league this year at times can be so small ER Virginia Applause Applause already today in the ACC there were two games decided by one Duke over BC Clemson over pit pokeys trying to overcome a 14point halftime deficit Joyner two thats a big bucket by George Hill joined and realize he had Justin mutts on him took his time and wanted to load in the super sleeve if anythings good much you got to understand thats the guy thats going to go for a buck he got a challenge in making shoot over extended hands Applause dishes Maddox nice topic nice patience there five just a month realizing the poster thats one of the best ways to be able to feed the man and you see great back cut by Darris Maddox he was waiting for mutts to attack off the dribble but hes a great passer his third assist tonight darkell Joyner again lost his dribble gets it back from game eight to shoot Joyner missed it offensive rebound Juana if youre bezilla you got to put a body on the water thats what hes out there for hims a wolf pack another opportunity those little things tonight have been lacking and Smith gets the foul from Maddox number three on Darius Maddox partner weve got a game on our hands and you see both teams going to make you see Justin must with a nice dime over the Maddox got a fivepoint game come on back its bow time thats not a phone in your pocket Applause Music Applause I remember time now for the Continental Tire recap Virginia Tech has never LED in this game and yet theyre hanging around within five 352 to go Applause love the support here in Blacksburg threegame losing streak students not all back for the semester but this place is rocking yeah I mean when you look at Grandview State the guy in the second half has picked it up for them Casey Marcel and at one point before he went out inside presidents had been DJ Burns but now him on the bench with his fourth foul Music to quavion Smith relatively quiet in the second half I thought that Virginia Tech was doing a better job and how theyre defending him on the pick and roll and 13 at halftime only four since then back to a seven point game with a guy for Virginia Tech that obviously has picked up his offensive Sean Padula Music Applause doing a good job of realizing that spacing wasnt the best best thing to do is put your head down on I call it a silent giant kill off that Runner being able to finish it solid performance for Collins in his first career start six points two rebounds two assists Joyner and he changes speeds well tough to guard again watched his penetration by MJ Collins again realizing Turner corner and you see dewana come over you see both he and Smith going at it and again being able to get it and look how hot elevation on that oh net beautiful touch Justin mutts did just pick up his fourth foul Brian and heres the thing anytime you switch with him and Joyner normally you can switch Justin must on most cars but Joyner is showing you his stop and start to build a vehicle One Direction to another thats hard for most guards let alone one of the bigs thats really good at handling guards on the switch just saw a little fist bump for Joiner after he made the front end of the one and one this is the back end its two possession game three minutes to play Music medulla to the corner Collins The Freshman over to Madison the five to shoot someone has to fire back to Maddox decent look rebound more cell good defensive possession by North Carolina State Virginia Tech went east to west and wasnt able to even touch the pain on that possession pokies choose the 14 from Deep tend to shoot Joyner attack initially now its Smith hang on the air its his own Miss right back up it was blocked but a foul caught on Maddox went on the penetration and you watch him again being able to be able to get off the ground and watch the second jump quick before anybody else you see Maddox coming up with that foul can you explained how that second jump ability is not natural but he just did well heres the thing you know talk about how great a score he is but hes a very good athlete hes got balance again youve seen some of his highlights Virginia Tech timeout in between the free throws taken by Mike Young Music hes right now shooting a season low percentagewise from three a little bit worse than they were against Penn State he still were able to beat the Nittany Lions though 210 to go one more free throw coming for NC State heres a look around the ACC some Milestone wins both for Leonard Hamilton his 400th win as the coach of the Knolls 600th in his career and uh Virginia gets the win over Syracuse and Tony Bennett becomes the alltime winningest head coach for mens basketball in Charlottesville Terry Holland yeah we talked about with this Clemson team obviously you know the Darlings of the league right now undefeated that pit team right behind and in Miami but a lot of teams right there jockey in position right at three and two thats why its really important for this game for both teams for Virginia Tech to protect home but for North Carolina state to be able to get a quality win against this team would be huge for them and the team the wolf pack smashed on Wednesday Duke finally gets a road win apparently escaping from Chestnut Hill with a victory Smith Goes one for two real close to two minute Mark and this game is still Within Reach Virginia Tech you got to find a way to come up with a basket you dont need a three youre right they just need a bucket Padula over to wanna that was great defense by Evie Duane a great recovery by Juwanna because a lot of times youll see Virginia Tech would put medulla on the post reaching foul on Padula itll be one and one for Joyner number two on Sean you see maybe a little frustration by Sean Padula thats reaching for the ball right there but let me tell you one of the things I think says DJ Burns is gone the one who has done a solid job of giving them that defense that they need Joyner another fist pump after that made front end of a one and one hes Music Joyner Smith combined average about 34 again that free throw gives them a combined 34 tonight Music Applause really need a basket here the Doula had it poked away Joyner the steal Joyner no cant keeps alive throws it back out and Marcel wins the foot race and gets away with an elbow whos recovery by Dan and I mean from the start of this game NC state has brought the intensity much like we saw at PNC on Wednesday its been one of the differences in the game Smith and North Carolina state has shown theyve been the scrap your team creates contact number four on games and you talk about the Halls you see the pigpike about Joyner now how about again not giving up on the play bring him to keep that play alive and give him that other possession there you see Roselle will look like he may have gotten away with the elbow but then you got your best playmaker in the game and you take your time and allow him to be able to go and get a bucket another 20point game for jaquavion Smith his third in a row and NC State on the verge of handing Virginia Tech the Hokies fourth consecutive loss and the Hokies have their next three on the road you see DJ Burns come in and how about the valuable minutes that Luana gave the wolf pack the prize on the bench with his four fouls so now for Virginia Tech youre going to have to extend your defense Music Maddox finally big Market makes it a sixpoint game with 555 seconds left the key to it is to be able to defend without fouling and you see Virginia take extend UC John Padula comes over gets that ball over to Darius Maddox knocks down that side of the three if its in this game Debbie keeps odds to take all the timeout but you see again being able to turn quick turnover get that point right now to stretch this and cut this lead down to six speaking of the road ahead for Virginia Tech I mean they go to Syracuse face a team led by a coach with over a thousand wins then a week after that they go to Charlottesville and face Tony Bennetts Cavaliers and then itll be interesting to see if Clemsons still in first place when Virginia Tech goes there on the 21st but thats a Tigers team that just came to Blacksburg and won here on Wednesday so its not getting any easier for the Hokies but heres the thing is good for the league as you see that schedule again you know earlier in the season Virginia Duke and North Carolina and then you throw Miami where the teams that were getting a lot of national Acclaim but you see the teams like Syracuse and Clemson that have stepped up throw in the mix that uh again pit team and its really good for the league when you have teams that on the road and at home making it challenging every night foreign State basketball next foul will be the 10th for Virginia Tech so itll be two shots rather than one and one for the wolf pack if youre Virginia Tech you want to be able to to defend without fouling you want to force them into those corners and have active hands NC State get it into your playmakers hands Smith turned it over immediately Collins kicks it Maddox oh my God timeout wont pack back to back threes for Maddox have transformed this one in just a matter of seconds as a leveler we talked about the fact that you want to be able to extend this game and Virginia Tech has found a way to be able to come out and create a look at it one fan right there was like Im not built for this you see great trap in the corner you see good hands mg Collins realizing not the Panic you got Darius Medics wide open knocks down another three and again great trap being able to turn it over not turn over and then finding the wide open guy down three partner we got a game on our hands and look they dont need a foul not at all because you look at shot clock is 28 and then for North Carolina State you got to do a better job of being able to get the ball and you got to stay away from those Corners because by doing that youre setting yourself up for that trap especially with a guy with like Justin Muntz there Applause assistant coach Kevin Giltner providing some words of wisdom hes a good staff Mike Jones in the second year as the top assistant after a long successful career at DeMatha and Im excited to see Rodney rice when he finally gets a chance to play Rodney rice played for Coach Jones at DeMatha he was trekavion Smith on the Hokey scout team a shoot around today in a practice yesterday and he was tearing up the Hokies first unit punch and we talked to my gun he is ecstatic to be able to have him to talk about a guy thats got bouncing can go get you a bucket got great vision also all right 458 remember the wolf pack inbound to the ball they still need to get it across half court and heres the thing if Im Kevin Keats then you you obviously want to get the ball to join them or you want to get it to Smith once you get across half court you run some blood you run some time and I would throw the ball inside to DJ Burns and allow him to load a big fella to go work but you got to get this ball in bounds first Burns back in there playing with four fouls eight nothing run in the last 18 seconds and another turnover and they get it right back the silly threw it away they still dont need to foul and basily with a touch foul Joyner will shoot two what a crazy sequence and missed opportunity for Virginia Tech they were able to force both Carolina State into a turnover and watch this play right there you see Grandpa silly comes up off balance throws it right over but uh excuse me Padulas head now hes going to come down to make him free throws Joyner three and four at the line tonight hes got two two possession game John Camdens checking back in rebounding purposes placing Collins Applause each team with one timeout left Joyner makes this the excuse the game to five and a few Virginia Tech you want a pitch through it doesnt necessarily have to be a three you want a quick bucket if you can get it hope for a pressure to try to slow down that quick bucket Applause to Doula oh nobody stopped him nice theres the quick bucket twosecond Difference game and shot clock Gantz fouled by bazzilli ant Gant has not attempted a free throw all season and it seems like theres a guy theres a guy in a foul hes a guy and again I told you you dont want a three easy shot but doing realizing he can get to the bucket and thats a quick basket along allow you to be able to stretch this game out no one right there at the uh at The Rim 69 percent from the line in his career at Providence thats his first freethrow attempt as a member of the wolf pack youre going to think about him crazy if he misses this next one out again Im going to go ahead and try to get me a quick twoin cut this game down and maybe play the fouling game right now you dont necessarily have to go with three you havent shot the three one all afternoon gets the roll in the second its a two possession game 28 seconds left walks it up the floor Padula had a poked away Joyner has him what a huge turnover wolf pack our one big step closer to a huge Road win and heres the thing with that possession North Carolina state did a good job of being able to have multiple guys watch the penetration by Padula he turns around Burns is there you got three guys looks like Smith cant get their hand on that ball you see the frustration from Sean Padula again still a lot of time left in this game though crucial free free throws by Jordan we saw an 80 run in 18 seconds we got 23 seconds left anything can happen Applause Wolfpack is a team theyve been good from the line 16 of 20 17 for 21 six point game Padula for Maddox for three yes why not why not every level of timeout Virginia Tech final timeout for the Hokies with 154 remaining see that last play Sean Padula bringing the ball up realizing that I cant get my three and wheres my buddy you see Maddox is like you know what baby Im sitting here waiting I got you knocked down another three so Mike young will not be able to take another time out NC state has one left its wolf pack ball Applause see if the Wolfpack can get it in without turning it over and find a free throw shooter tonights Hardy star to watch by the way Casey morsel 15 points back here in the Commonwealth of Virginia he made some big shots early in the second half to help the wolf back and I thought that went in the second half he came out and hes one of those guys gave you that third option as far as the score being able to penetrate with the ball on the floor into here again big night for him being able to get down and get to the cup he was that guy again when they needed some offense gave it to him inside outside especially in the second half Applause hes won a four wolf pack and double figures Gant is going to throw the inbounds he can run the Baseline gets it to Joyner Padula picks up his fourth great recognition by Kevin Keith to realize that Jordan has been that got a nice Rhythm from the freethrow line you get him the ball and basically tell everyone to get out of the way so weve got 11 seconds left hes a very important free throws Markell Joyner seven of eight from the line tonight hes got 20 points and hes still got 20 points this next one is massive Music fourpoint game Pokey theater hurry Padula fouled by Marcel thats the last thing you want to do if your Marcel is fouled obviously you dont want to give medulla wide open layup now this is a twoshot foul hokeys in the double bonus The Duel just took a look at the clock 77 remaining I wonder if he makes the first would they consider missing the second intentionally first things first though yep what do you think I think you make it and you force NC State to take the ball out you try to get a trap off the first possession if not you foul theyve proven on multiple times that theyve can have some trouble especially if you can force them to get into the corners Doula cant give the foul but shes got four I was wondering who Camden was going to replace he facility goes to the bench now you got to give the foul immediately here but if youre Petula if you can help it you dont want to foul dangerous pass trapped in the corner but they had to give the foul under 10 seconds to go sharkwavion just could hold that ball there for six seconds with a bear hug and the game would be over yeah you watch this next play you can see Smith comes to the ball Gina take did a good job of being able to trap him Fallon Camden Smith needs them both Applause no timeouts for Virginia Tech if Smith misses it the Hokies will have a chance for quavion Smith has been the answer tonight again shot the ball great but hes got 22 points and that free throw might have been the dagger Music Padula misses an NC State wins at Castle for the second year in a row 7369 another hardfought excruciating loss for the Hokies yeah huge knives for both the back bad court for NC State Virginia Tech fall back but came up short and in heck of a game Hokies battled but nevertheless
