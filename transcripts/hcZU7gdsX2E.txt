very important piece back today an abubakar trayor 65 senior guard uh he only played the first two games and then he broke his arm spoke with Pat Kelce yesterday hes probably going to play about 10 minutes today he has been cleared whatever he contributes is secondary to just getting that extra piece five more fouls more minutes a little bit more depth for a team that badly needs it is ACC is getting underway Kimble straightway three was off to the left this is the 76 sixth meeting between these two schools a rivalry that goes back about 105 years to 1919 Colonels have not beaten the Cardinals in about 60 years ter Edward gets the scoring started and your New Years wish list for Louisville is for Terence Edwards to get going just played his best game of the season in that win over Florida State not just the 19 points eight assists and one turnover finally finding his rhythm Holt comes up short rebound def finds Blandon just inside the free throw line he gets the bounce to get the colonels on the board see that is one area that is going to be a problem for Louisville going in a conference play as the backboards not only are they not real big theyre not a real physical team its just kind of comes to the territory for the way they play Cardinals 7 and5 overall but one and one in the ACC the one loss nothing to be ashamed of they played the Blue Devils tough here at the Yum Center earlier this month the ACC opener in a really nice nice win shot the ball spectacularly well at the Tucker Center last Saturday against the seminal Javon Hatley lost it on the way there and myar wall coming the other way for the colonels deflected pass still finds Kimbo and he buries the corner three Kimbo makes him pay nice job by Terrence Edwards getting back and stopping the ball but you got to find those Shooters in transition Edwards wide open knocks it down and thats how you do it beat him at the other end nice bounce in his step Edwards five Colonels five Terrence Edwards was a sunbell Player of the Year at James Madison part of that great team they had last year that won a game of the NCA tournament Mark Byington was the coach at JMU now at Vanderbilt Kimbell onehanded pass to the corner and Jackson Holt drains the trip Applause three I set the over under uh conservatively about 603s attempted for the two teams combined theyre going to be firing all afternoon long and were going to stay here Bert Smith El leite official has a foul in the rebound action against myar wall for easn Kentucky you see Chucky heern the simple skip pass over to the far Wing Chucky he what a season he is having experience point guard started 115 games at Wisconsin yeah its its hard to imagine what the Cardinals would be without him Seth well dont even say that out loud theres Hadley for three as well the threes are firing this is what wed like to see in late December at the KFC Young 88 both teams are two for three from Deep Cardinals picking up where they left off last Saturday when they made 15 threes at Florida State and went 10 for 15 in the second half to pull away its amazing how much easier the game is when those threes go in Blanton doesnt get the roll and James Scott pulls down the rebound Here Comes Louisville Edwards pretty good transition defense from Eastern Kentucky and a good decision by Edwards to throw it out a lot of switching every time theres a dribble hand off theyre going to switch CH clock at nine Waterman in the corner and Eastern Kentucky fumbles the rebound away its louisv the Applause ball Pat Kelce said hes brought energy wherever hes Applause been taken over for Kenny Payne after a a strong three years at Charleston nine really good years at winthrip and aw Hamilton and Kelsey first met on the campus of Wake Forest

eight the former Wisconsin Badger heurn kicks it to the corner Hadley with three R Smiths first shot Applause Music Waterman pulls it back out Hadley with excellent position rejected by the rib but stays with it and scores Kimbell pull up from the elbow too strong Smith the other way the Australian Sharpshooter coming off a 27point afternoon in Tallahassee this is an offensive foul Tony

lets see if this gamble pays off come on heres the snap the kick is up and its good steps up fires inter Applause accepted theres always next season four out of five customers can find a health plan for 10 or less per month new law lower prices healthcaregov is here for you youre watching CW Courtside Saturday brought to you by All State youre in good hands amongst all the Louisville red there are some Eastern Kentucky fans in the house Music they are fired up as you can tell theyll get fired up its early its early for them out late last night probably right hit in the town there a lot to do in Louisville absolutely its kind of an early start well the Cardinals so far have gotten five offensive rebounds five different players have gotten them and theyve got five second chance points and were almost 5 minutes in pretty good pretty good and I really like the fact that the teams are combined four for nine from three no free throws yet you mentioned those five offensive rebounds very important for Louisville good energy good crowd good atmosphere and we expect a good game Eastern Kentucky looked they they were tight with both Clemson and pit with about 10 15 minutes left on the road at Little John in the Peterson Event Center respectively before succumbing to the other ACC foes theyve played this is an Eastern Kentucky team coming off its first regular season Conference Championship in 45 years last year going 12 and four to win the Atlantic Sun Smith had it blocked by butre and it was out of bounds on the Baseline will stay with the Cardinals Smith coming off that incredible game at Florida State 27 points of course 6 for9 from three 88 of a shots are from behind the threepoint line but he made a couple twos the last couple of games you saw it there putting it on the deck a little bit I he knows hes allowed to dribble but he is nice ball movement yeah Hadley cant connect and its going to stay Louisvilles ball again Eastern Kentucky struggling on the defensive glass right now yeah you know I talked to Pat Kelce for a while yesterday and he just cant say enough good things about Javon Hadley we know what he bur and Edwards bring to the team but Hadley is that glue guy Swiss army knife my buddy Clark Kell calls them Val utility hes really their both their best post scorer as well and a good passer Scott with his size kicks Applause it seven of the Cardinals first 11 shots have been from Beyond The Arc Edwards with a clock winding down finds Hadley and a defensive board finally for the colonels butri is a sharp shooter and he comes up short tedward uh Terrence Edwards Resurgence the past couple weeks has been absolutely gigantic just his versatility his slipperiness as a dribbler hes a dynamic dude yeah and you know what Ive noticed EV in these last few games is he just looks more instinctive to me you know you think he was this great player at James Madison sunbell Player of the Year played four years there and you just move him to a different team and he should still be the same player and its not even adjusting to the level of competition its a total new system its new players and you tend to overthink until you get comfortable and these last few games I see that Applause instinctively really underestimate how long it takes for these teams is bringing in a lot of transfers a lot of it is the coaches learning about the players and trying to figure out what they can do in real time Chu perries the right wi three we know what he can do I think hes been the best guard in the ACC hav I havent thought about that but that is interesting and you might very well be right well you know RJ Davis was the preseason Player of the Year and a great player for North Carolina he hasnt played Great Edward spinning to the bucket kicks it to the corner North Carolinas coming in here on New Years Day by the way that should be interesting Kay Ru the only freshman on the Cardinals hell stay with Louisville so Id love to see James Scott get going a little bit as a post scorer but there you see Chucky heper the type of season hes had coming over for Wisconsin making 35 from three and hes become a lot more assertive as a scorer in this syst Kadir trayor just checked in got a nice Applause from the crowd inbound the ball to him and hes called for a turnover he one second into his outing its his first game since early November he fractured a bone in his left arm that has kept him out since therell be time to get him into Rhythm but you know the good news is when you when youre inj your arm you can still do a lot of conditioning work a lot of a lot of players coming off of injury the conditioning is the hardest thing to get used to so its going to take him some time but with the injuries theyve had to have one more piece back you see him underneath a welcome back Miss for ruths he comes up empty with a layup what do we got BT Smith and Tony Henderson staring at each other at the jump ball Arrow belongs to the Cardinals number one back replacing Smith I understand why the official was calling for a travel yeah just took a few steps give could be traveled it could be out of bounds Chucky heper and grabbed the Applause ball Terrence Edward Jr with a skip to his step pulls it back out heurn by the way is 18th in the country in steals percentage so not only does he run the offense well one of the best on ball defenders in the country trayor see I dont mind the pass out I just would like to see James Scott assert himself under the rim as a score hes the tallest guy on the floor right now like Javon Hadley just did there you go and Hadley is smaller James Scott is just not used to it but thats what Hadley does you got a close out on him and he puts it on the deck not the biggest guy out there but hes got that old man game he knows how to score that little baby hook shot finding the rim and completing the threepoint play thats value excuse me set 11 straight points for the Cardinals adley now has eight with a made three and two rebounds this is the final nonconference game for both of these teams ason play starts with a trip to Central Arkansas January second for EKU Seth mention Tar Heels coming to town New Years Day here in Kentucky chance for threepoint play for Turner butry butri is their best threepoint shooter so you got to close out hard on him and then he puts it down on the deck buts first two of the game hell look for the old passion three when we come back Music youre watching CW Courtside Saturday brought to you by Pacific Life creating Financial Security for nearly 160 Music years and you can ring in the new year with NXT dont miss the final episode of the year as NXT is all new this Tuesday December 31st at 8 Eastern 7 Central right here on the CW this the final game of 2024 in a few days will be a quarter of the way in to the present Century which is a mindblowing fact one thats one way to look at it may me feel older than I already am here Ill tell you for Louisville sort of reverting to form in terms of the three Point shooting we mentioned about how well they shoted in Tallahassee three for 11 so far today but how about 10 to one offensive rebounds and theyre plus six 8 to two second chance points so plus six second chance plus six on the scoreboard thats the story of the game Seth do you remember where you were December 31st 1999 if you must ask if you must know how about Madison Square Garden for a Billy Joel concert is that Im a cliche lets be honest Im a cliche that sounds fantastic with my we werent married Im trying to think of I think we were engaged well you should know when your wedding was well I know we were not married Im trying to think if we were engaged might not have been engaged I dont know if this will Top what you did I was at the Grand Canyon oh look at you we did a 12 mile hike on December 31st 1999 it was 70° we woke up on January 1st 2000 there were 8 inches of snow on the ground oh wow you dont want to be in the were you like down in the canyon no we hike down and then back up okay you dont want to be actually in the canyon when its snow Devonte Blandon with his second bucket for the colonels who are back within three and theyll have a chance to score as the Cardinals turn it over here terrific pass from Javon Hadley to the tuba Music player the TU players got good hands but hes not eligible to catch a pass you I mentioned about the threepoint shooting for Louisville you know Noah Waterman you mentioned six years in college hes only shooting 27 coming into this one 0 for two when he was a Detroit one year he made 53 from three and thats shooting almost five attempts a game he is an outstanding threepoint shooter if theres one X Factor for Louisville moving forward its Waterman becoming more efficient in that department you see the subtle too small from Tay Tay Blandon there doing the work inside was that at me cuz Im you know Im in that it was directly at it was to everybody quite frankly well it would apply accurately to me Im just saying little Zone look now from Eastern Kentucky Edwards from the corner M know aw Hamilton likes to mix up his defenses and throw different looks but Louisville is not a great team to Zone because they dont have much of an inside game theyre all about the three so all you got to do is move that ball around and the Zone will pinch and leave looks butri comes up short Edwards leading the break blocker charge its a block I think were going to get a block he did a good job he was trying to avoid the charge it was close though first down Blandon close captioning for CW court side Saturday is brought to you by Sketchers basketball comfort that performs Applause Louisville right now 6 for 18 from the floor Waterman right on there you go there you go he just got to keep firing man I mean eventually the math is going to take care of itself they shot the ball better lately seven for 16 his last two games one for three to start today hes basically a 611 two guard and Javon Hadley is a 66 center how would you characterize Devonte Blandon just a baller just a player he is a load at the mid major level thats for sure over 1700 points in his career coming into the day I mentioned five years at Eastern Kim did not hit the rim as a shot block violation outstanding defensive possession for Louisville fantastic connectivity at the defensive end all that switching all that talking number 21 its going to be interesting watch them against North Carolina too Haven because Carolina is a similar team they dont have much inside they have some size but their big guys prefer to play outside I dont know any bigs who play inside anymore to be honest if you grant the premise that Duke is the clear favorite heading into the bulk of conference play I ask you who do you think is the second best team in the ACC right now on December 28th I would say its probably North Carolina I know theyve had their struggles but theyve played a really difficult schedule too and thats a very good UCLA team that they beat their problem is they keep falling behind by these huge margins they just have to remember that the game actually starts in the first half and not just the second as you see Terrence Edwards taking it to the rack they didnt fall behind by 15 against Florida they win that game I mean I think they were down 20 to Kansas its been game after game for them its a very odd if youre looking for a Cable News Network which respects all Americans and you have a new home with news Nation Cy news nation is Americas most trusted Cable News Network to find news Nation on your screen go to news Nation nowcom think Carolinas in the mix Clemson and pit I think both have a chance to be in the mix and I think this Louisville team is going to learn a lot about the El in the first half of January cuz they got Carolina Virginia Clemson pit the the next four games and those might be three of the five best teams in the league and Louisville could be among those five best teams in the league well see well I think theyll be in the mix a collision between Hadley and Kimble and Kimbles down and its five on four there was no whistle blown theres still no whistle heer gets a wide open three and drains it aw Hamilton is fu yeah thats a double whammy for the colonels cuz not only does the kid get hurt but they dont stop the action you know generally the rule is that if theres a fast break opportunity youre supposed to let it complete I believe that was inadvertent now theyre going to go and look at this on the replay as well they should Ill say just cuz its inadvertent I agree theres nothing intentional about it that thats a foul yeah yeah thats a different thats a different question thats a different question although hes supposed to give the you know the player a chance to land as well so lets see Chucky heurn second three makes it previous play is under red theyll review it during the break close Capt youre watching tww sportside Saturday brought to you by fresh pet its not dog food its food food and by healthcaregov new law lower prices enroll today 2617 Louisville 815 to play in the half lets go back to the collision between Hadley and Kimble after the last bucket yeah its kind of an odd play cuz you usually dont see such hard collisions in that part of the court and and I dont I dont think kimbells trying to take a charge or anything I just think they ran into each other now do Hadley lean into them a little bit maybe you could make that case I think its no whistle play on but Im sure it hurt Im not saying it didnt hurt flexing that right wrist hes like I just got drilled and its no call Tony Henderson walking over says nothing but the key thing to remember there of course Evan is that whether or not its a foul is not reviewable they cant look at a replay and say oh that was a foul they can issue it a flagrant one if they turn it to be excessive or a nonbat basetball play which clearly it was not so theyre right to go to the Monitor and they made the right call having said that when Im Zar of college basketball there will be no replays of any kind and remind me to get back to that lanton from the Baseline cant connect cuz its only a matter of time until I am Zar of college basketball frankly its overdue as far as Im concerned youve been the Zar of basketball for decades Im the jester out of bounds to EKU so were talking about the ACC and Louis my concern is the way that they play is hard to sustain over a long conference season when youre tired when youre on the road when you get some bumps and bruises and youre worn down and guys are missing practice and they get the flu to rely on that threepoint shot you have to be more efficient than theyve been the problem becomes youre going to have some really bad shooting nights whats your plan B whats your plan C Im not sure they had that anyway and given these injuries it becomes a bit more of a dicey Prospect nice pass by Waterman beautiful ball movement ruths comes up empty from Beyond The Arc thats why I mentioned James Scott like if someone can just give you a couple of buckets at The Rim makes it a little easier on Target and good for Jackson Holtz his second triple of the ball game but to your point Seth I think Plan B is is the guy who just made that pass Chucky heern doing damage where he can ruths keep shooting keep shooting it but you know what else you can do by the way is get to the foul line and uh Louisville right now only two for three theyre not a high uh free throw shooting team and part because they take so many threes thats it Bland over Waterman for three then you go up against a team thats bit of an underdog bit chip and then they get some confidence in them and now we got a ball game Colonels hanging around also racking up the fouls Tyler Andrews just picked up his second Waterman is right there see his when his hands come down thats thats the opening that you cannot give him those hands have to stay up even if its just to bother his eyesight you can bother a shooter by waving your hand in front of his eyes and not commit a foul and then if he makes it you say good shot I got a pop quiz for you put you on the spot Tay not pop culture right this it can only be Sports were talking basketball Tay Tay Blandon with his 36point game one of 20 college players who scored more than 35 in a game so far this season so its a pretty exclusive list what player in college basketball has the highest point game so far this year Jordan pope from Texas 42 not quite Ryan Cal brener oh 49 scor 49 he went 20 for 22 okay but the the best combination of scoring and name was tracon Eagle staff at the University of North Dakota against Alabama Edwards and one and that name is easy to say and thats how you get three points the oldfashioned way C crer 49 was against Texas Rio Grand Valley check out Edwards in transition yeah nice job getting ahead of the defense and if you can score that way you dont have to worry about playing against the half court and a nice pitch ahead by Javon Hadley George Kimble the third just picked up his second foul Edwards into double figures already four of five from the floor two for two from Deep two for three at the line yeah how good has he been over his last four averaging 21 points a game 46 from three coming off his best game of the season at Florida State right on time been a breath of fresh air for Cardinals fans during this recent stretch H pulls up pretty good defense by Smith with a contest what a rebound on the offensive glass staying with it but better defense from behind Terrence Edwards with the block Andrews with the initial rebound martinov sets the screen blinton going at Hadley Applause kept Alive by kurl martinoff and hes swatted away by Hadley this possession is going on five chances Smith to Edwards for two Terence Edwards doing it at both ends of the floor right now its the te show in the KFC Young hes got 14 the lead back to 10 with 501 to play in the half getting a head of the defense Smith the pitch ahead going to his left switching back to his right breaking out all the old man tools are you kidding me the old man tools at arriv 22 years of age at his fth year of college basketball well youre watching CW court side Saturday presented by All State youre in good hands heav leeler alongside Seth Davis and our entire crew delighted to be with you on the final Saturday of the Year here in the Derby City weve talked about Edwards recent success here it is in graphic form yeah and and you could see it sort of steadily happen over the course of the Season he had some nice moments here in there he scored 21 against Duke 23 at Kentucky but theres just a consistency and a comfort there they actually took him out you mentioned this at the top they took him out of the starting lineup I asked Pat Kelsey this he said you know just along the way youre pushing buttons youre trying different things you just you know youre just guessing so they take him out of the starting line or bring him off the bench and he was great so now they put him back in the starting lineup and hes still great or as you would say great youre doing that card next time Seth give me them Frosted Flakes I think I saw Pat Kelce motioning toward CLA Aubrey one of the officials and said look out for the push off presumably talking about Blandon no push off and a strong take there for Tay Tay Blantons got that old man game knows how to use his muscle and Rain Smith making it rain thats what he does run to the line hands up and if you want to assist get him the rock hes made a three in every game this year in fact hes made multiple threes in every game this year coming into the day Andrews cannot answer rebound for Smith last one went in so he might shoot it again he might make it again there it is now multiple threes in every game this year you cant make it if you dont take it Montavious Myrick keeps it alive on the offensive glass and well go to the line for Eastern Kentucky not a bad name montus my but rain Smith just like he did in Charleston make it rain for the Cardinals here in Music Louisville next buying college textbooks can feel like a nightmare next long lines lost time and inflated prices and thats luck lets take a look at todays game summary presented by Pacific Life creat ating Financial Security for nearly 160 years Cardinals on a 132 run set Davis yeah its been the a Terrence Edwards show here as you see him doing it inside outside hes doing it on the defensive end too hes got a couple of rebounds to go with those 14 points Hadley and heon have eight a piece so thats 30 of the 39 so far for Louisville and good threepoint shooting thats always going to be the story for them 44 8 for 18 from behind the arc and thats whats allowed them to push out here 132 run over the last 2 minutes 18 seconds think about this they average n and 1 half May threes per game in their last two halves the second half against Florida State where they made 10 first half today theyve made eight double their game average 18 threes for Louisville in the last two hals theyre not always going to go in like this but its nice when they do well like I said theyre not always going to go in but but theyre always going to go off and thats just their identity and thats thats the way the math works you dont have to play well over 40 minutes when youre taking that many threes its its interesting like now Brad Underwood at Illinois hes Mr analytics hes like Nate Os 20 Mr old school stepen F Austin Joo guy yeah told me he wishes that every shot could be a threepoint he is that I wish every single shot we took was a three three point there are some folks that think that way Edwards is a Believer Let it Fly young fellow bring him some bourbon largest lead of the half for Louisville Cardinals have made their last five shots 15point Cardinal Advantage strong hedge from Hadley good recovery as well on Blandon Music myar wall to Blandon going Baseline draws the bump and the bucket and a chance for three for Devonte Bland the fifth year Colonel so this is young man playing with a lot of confidence gets that screen from tayori they went underneath the ball went right up and blon taking it at CH as well blon doing everything he can to keep this thing close hes got 13 bumpy return so far for Trey Ori not to be unexpected but in 5 minutes hes picked up three fouls hes over for two does have a rebound and an assist you know Pat Kel is excited to have just another body that he can count on and trust and getting him into the swing of things heading into January is crucial Waterman fakes it takes it and hell get to the free throw line dont see him do that too often put it on the deck you called him a two guard thats what he is dont let the smooth tast fool you at 61 27 points in his last two ball games made the one threepointer so far today what really hurt Louisa was losing case in Pryor I mean hes a really really good hes like he plays like Draymond Green he was playing great in the Bahamas when he went out he was huge in the Bahamas wins there over Indiana well coming up at the half halftime show presented by Subaru love its what makes Subaru Subaru well get a preview of the Bison in the orange well get a preview of the Snoop Dog Arizona Bowl well also have first half stats and story lines here from the Yum Center good to see Snoop putting his name on a bowl by the way hes got a very low profile have you noticed you dont see him anywhere yeah he he he hates Paris theres a corner three from myar wall he was he was the biggest face he was the face of the Olympics was the face of the Olympics too and then Snoop and maybe not in that order saw Snoop on stage last year with Willie Nelson On Wills 90th birthday at the Hollywood Bowl that sounds fun it was Snoop and Willie Im sure two PS in a pot kind of like they said about Woodstock if you remember it you werent there BL strong take to the rack thats a gr man right there nice steal off the inbounds Mr Kentucky continues to be feisty they were down 15 a second ago and all of a sudden get it back to a sevenpoint game here see Blandon just Waterman out there on an island he knows hes got him on skates no resistance at the rim no shot blocking at Louisville thats going to be another thing watch over the long term but the Louisvilles had games where they havent played well down the stretch largely because of that short bench so I think if youre Eastern Kentucky and aw Hamilton youre thinking maybe we can wear them down over 40 minutes Bucknell and Syracuse coming up after were done here in Louisville its the second half of our CW Courtside double header it is not as bombing in central New York as it is here in Louisville Kentucky today I can promise you that Edwards shoved Away by wall for the rebound no whistle and wall saves it near the U bench Blandon looking inside but smacked Away by Hadley Smith to Waterman rebounded by Blandon his third rebound and Colonels could make it a fivepoint game here well cut it to four with a three Id like that shot from Waterman though hes got to let it f hes got to let it fly Kimbell Miss fires Louisville ball whether it works or not you know you see Eastern kuy is now a little 70 run tighten this thing up but Louisville is not going to change the way they play theyll win this way or they will lose this way but you have to be Allin you cant be halfway pregnant with this kind of system you got to be youre either youre either going to play this way or youre not and the math does work if you have good Shooters and they believe that they have the shooters to do it like Ryan Smith Louisville with 11 off defensive rebounds in this first half and up high James Scott throws it down thats what happens when you have Chucky heon on your team always making the right play hes had a quiet first half letting the game come to him but make no mistake fourth assist first two for Scott Louisville should see it again and theyre going to see it quickly Hadley the steal Hadley miss the dve oh he drinks Applause Bri well now the Cardinals can take the last shot it was all part of the plan hes going to hear about that for a while going to hear about that for a while Louisville Seth this was a problem for you in your playing days right you always miss dunks like this yes on the bitt courts at Camp equino I mean I think he was actually distracted because the defender George kemell looked like he was going to make a play on the ball and then stepped away you see how it looks like hes going to jump at him and then he doesnt at least thats the excuse that I would use but given how good he is and what he means to this team hes allowed a flat tire or two it is the modern year of college basketball but you look at Louisville obviously a brand new team a lot of talented players a lot of guys that played in the big dance last year coming together and all right you see all these talented players and its about how they fit how do you feel Pat Kelce has done assimilating everybody into his system through 12 13 games I think hes done a tremendous job but hes done had to do so much adapting on the Fly because of all of these injuries and I mentioned this at the top Evan wherever hes gone hes played like 11 12 guys at a furious Breakneck Pace up and down so he hasnt even had to think about things like fatigue and a short Ben so hes adjusting two final seconds of the half Edwards has been the hot hand Edwards didnt get it off despite that clunky finish it was a half where the Cardinals made nine threes scored four to begin the second half here inside the KFC Yum Applause Center Bland now in a tie for fourth all time in EKU history on the alltime scoring list myara Wall comes up empty and Waterman the rebound Waterman takes the three on the drive lays it in with the right hand very nice use that threepoint shot to set up the drive nicely done by Noah been playing in college for six years he should have a couple of tricks you would think were getting close to the end of the co ERA this is the last year year this is the last year thats a great Point College Basketball be a little younger next season nice poke by poke Away by Hadley Bandon has nothing no choice but to make for the foul see we talk about quickness in basketball but if youre a threepoint threat you become quicker cuz they have to come out and play you and thats what Waterman did wall bit on the fake nothing but free sailing to the rim like does him do a little bit more of that like a young Kevin Durant similar that might be slightly hyper balling very similar same Applause height Hadley creates contact see Hadleys got that old man game too he loves to operate right at that foul line mid post area he can play with his back to the basket Chucky heurn can play with his back to the basket L see the biggest news of the first minute of the second half Tay Tay Blandon picked up his third foul and now myar wall picked up his third foul thats going to be a problem for E kuu if they want to contend here into the waning moments no question cuz you dont want to take Blandon out of the game and the problem is they become Sitting Ducks defensively cuz he knows he cant get his fourth so conversely if youre Louisville whoever hes guarding whoever blaton is guarding thats who you want to have the ball put him in a ball Applause screen Holt rebound to hurn and he went down oh no Chucky heper lost it hopefully pop back up either poked in the eye or hit in the head area maybe popped on the Applause nose this is literally the last thing any louville fan wants to see hopefully its just a short catch your breath adjust your contact good yeah hes got his hands on his nose you see that didnt look like he was hit that hard maybe he was hitting the swiped across the eye sensitive area yeah hes back on his feet yeah so so so you see that Walls hand coming down I think grazed His Eye Is what happened there thats a scary situation when that happens hopefully hes all right yeah hes hes going to stay in the Applause game well I did see the Louisville team rules before I came out there one of the rules is that Chucky Hipp is actually not allowed to get hurt so theres really no reason for concern you know every single time you know a player gets suspended for a violation of team roles I always want to ask what are your rules coach Ive never actually seen the list so its cool that you got the inside access yeah well so so the rule here now is if a player gets attended to by any uh Personnel from the team in this case a trainer he has to come out for one whistle so heurn had to leave the game good news though that he looked like he was going to stay in Applause Kimbell for Applause three Colonels are 0 for two with a turnover to start the second half Louisville looking to reestablish a 15point lead rain Smith comes up short offensive rebound finds wall coming down the middle pulk from the wing bang every time thats going up Jackson H missed all of last year aw Hamilton said he could have come back midseason but they made the choice to let him rest recover fully said it was the best decision they made last year Kimbo to the basket before the shot he was fouled they not going to count it foul on Edwards this is what theyre training to do in transition run right to that threepoint line thats thats the best look that you get that and then off an off an offensive rebound there was a game in Jackson Holts High School career where he made 18 threes and scored 58 Blandon tough shot hes going to make money playing ball

prompted the pack Kelsey timeout what uh what has happened here these last few possessions for Louisville thats allowed the colonels right back in well I I I feel like Louisvilles putting themselves in a bind on the offensive end a little bit of a disruption with with Chucky heper going out but you know Terrence Edwards had 17 points in the first half might want to get in the ball hasnt taken a shot in the second half Chucky heer hasnt taken a shot in the second half of course its Applause early but when your offense starts to come unglued a little bit in those turnovers that opens up those shot opportunities at the offensive end for Eastern Kentucky and the colonels are playing kind of swarming defense right now a couple minutes ago James Scott had a lazy turnover Four Louisville turnovers the first 3 minutes of the half welcome to the game Frank and selum eBay his second block of the Year emphatically over the Baseline yeah they may want to give anelo aay some run because I I do feel like James Scott has been a little bit physically overwhelmed at times in this Music game Kimbell to wall oh hits Hulk back door with some English off the glass tell you what Jackson Holt nearly another turnover Edwards hesitates takes it see I dont know why he why is he even hesitating out there byley and a tip for Hatley goes Hadley the second Cardinal in double figures snaps the 90 konel Applause run foul on anelim eBay Eastern basketball two years at Syracuse two years at Georgia now at Louisville for the Nigerian whos got size and has played Applause sparingly Tay Tay Blandon Zips it to Hulk nice ball movement wall knocks down the three May Wall came in one for his last 19 from three one for 19 over his last five knocks that one down and weve got a threepoint ball Applause game oh the foul will s Louisville to the line but the Eastern Kentucky Cardinals have battled back Trail by as many as 15 now was a threepoint game threepoint game with 16 minutes left left here at the Yum Center Evan leer Seth Davis back with your court side we wanted to take a moment to acknowledge the really sad news that broke yesterday in the world of sports TV your longtime colleague at CBS Sports Greg Gumble passed away I know he meant a lot to you you wrote a great tribute on poops HQ can you paraphrase what you wrote here for our viewers yeah he he was just a great guy like that red light there you and I know this you cant hide from that red light you cant be on the air for as long as Greg Gumble was and hide who you you are so so many people have said to me since his passing Evan Bo you know I watched him all these years he seemed like he was a really good guy well guess what he was and he seemed to be the only guy in the world who didnt know that he was Greg Gumble you know what Im saying he was easy to be around no ego total Pro lot of fun treated everybody well and so the broadcasting industry lost a great Legend I obviously lost a very close friend but believe me anybody who worked with him like they were his really good friend so thats what makes it so sad to see him go and he called Super Bowls and covered NBA and college hoops and was just a sports icon and hes youre right he seemed like a great guy I love that you also wrote about the things that irked him like eggs and golf yeah he had he had a strong aversion to eggs he always said he hated parades he would never go to a parade and uh he had he really didnt like the game of golf he mocked it and it was awkward cuz Clark Kell and I love golf we could talk about golf almost as long as we can talk about basketball oh this is a was a lot of fun back to a one possession game on the tip in there you have got to be supremely impressed with the way these cinal came out of that halftime locker room and have absolutely taken it to the Cardinals who are on their heels right now look at the way Eastern kyy is defending right now Five Points I should say nine points for George Kimble thei after that tip good hands from wall theyll stay Louisville ball with nine to shoot this is a part of the game by the way as you see the uh the Kimble bucket there on Hadley whos Louisvilles uh best defender excuse me Blandon with the drive and then Kimbell with the follow but this is where Chucky he I think needs to take over Evan settle everybody Music down inbound to Smith get a touch for Hadley heer an open in the corner Chucky rounding out but a strong rebound for Scott fantastic rebound for Scott its going up again there we go Scott trying to keep it alive again and he cannot do so its EKU ball didnt get the bucket and Chucky Hein looks a little uh frustrated you wonder if that little scrape he had in his eye might be affecting his vision but nice couple of minutes from James Scott got the rebound couldnt couldnt save it but the previous offensive rebound into the open threepoint look but I do wonder about that eye with heer EKU down by three with the ball Kimbell passed up to three finger roll going glass hell have a chance to tie it at the Applause line it was Tay Tay Blandon in the first half and theyve spread things around here in the second half almost using Blandon as as a decoy you got to worry about blon so much you see Hadley cheating up top and that opens up the driving Lanes guys kind of looking at each other right now cool kiss off the glass there for George Kimble the third he misses the free throw that would a tied it but Louisville Lo loses it out of bounds you kidding me two teammates battling each other for the rebound ruths and Scott thats a yikes moment there for the Cardinals Holt for the lead yes sir Jackson Holt has been unreal in this second half bouncing with confidence making shots spreading the floor and a more balanced attack for the colonels first EKU lead since it was 85 early in the Applause first Chucky heurn takes over teren said were just not in the game right now for Louisville Pat Kelce giving him a rest here but Cardinals fans trying to give their defense a lift Blandon versus Hadley tough turnaround sweet shot all theyre doing is letting him operate in space letting him operate in space nudge with the left shoulder that creates all the space he needs and they got an illegal screen oh theyre calling just an offensive foul on Chucky thats his Applause Music third you know the rols are reversed now cuz for years Pat Kelce was the team coaching a mid major giving a high major hell on their home Applause court hes wondering where the foul was lets see the play I actually thought it was on you know looked like Hein got hit in the face he did give him a tug of the jersey in the pants the shorts and I think thats what the call was the hold of the defender shorts blank rejected Cardinals closed in defensively nicely and then turning it over Edwards back in the game lost the handle George Kimbell I third one of the best in the nation in that department deflected out of bounds by Kai Roots now is Louisville six turnover of the half theyve got 13 for the game Eastern Kentucky has six little push off against Kimble the whistle blows and thats the third on Kimble basketall so those fouls now piling up three each for Kimble and Blandon and three for Walt Applause maybe came in a little bit late there dont know if that might be a makeup call for the one on he I dont know those were the words that were going through my mind Im not sure any of these calls have been wrong but theres a lot of contact that wasnt called earlier and the officials are tightening up the whistle right now and now Andrews just picked up his third so the fouls are really piling up for Eastern Kentucky but Louisvilles got to make them pay four Colonels with three fouls a piece Kimble Blandon Andrews and wall so Louisville needs to be in attack mode right now with the mindset its Hadley and one and thats their best attacker Javon Hadley thats his four personal 16 Andrews picks up his fourth Seth got three and four in quick fashion actually got Andrews on the trail I thought it might have been on Paul who actually jumps straight up but you dont get that call unless you Music attack thats why Kelsey loves this kid so much the way he plays the way he thinks the game theres a good test for Louisville right now I mean this is this is how you grow up as a basketball team see what you made of and now you see the energy coming up from the Yum happy holidays Lou you joke you just came for the bourbon you got a good ball game in the second half as well Mayar wall working on Roots all alone scores Applause anyway eight points for wall tied at 59 Music Applause ruths kind of a stagnant offensive possession so the Freshman goes to work and comes up empty EKU looking for the lead again beautiful pass from glanton but his teammate lost it on the way Applause up Chucky heper is on the bench for Louisville they miss him R Smith Off the Mark Edwards right in front of Pat Kelsey tracks Down The Long rebound Smith looking High Scott comes down with it back up no good and U will take a breath go back to that play where Hein got scraped in the eye this would not normally be a time of the game in a situation where hed be on the bench makes me wonder if hes coming back that would have given the colonels a threepoint lead but Kimble cant connect hes now one for six Beyond The Arc in the ball Applause game heers going to check in right now three Cardinals sitting at the scorer table Edwards contested three Scott inspired offensive rebound R Smith clangs it off the back iron and then Scott pokes it away but hes called for the foul well James Scott got pushed around a lot in the first half so at least hes fighting on the glass right now cuz thats what its going to take for Louisville to

stat brought to you by Sketcher Footwear stylish comfort for men women and kids how about the contrast in the second half Seth 0 for seven from three thats really all you need to see nine for 21 in the first half we talked about that being the story of the game and Eastern Kentucky doing a better job on the glass weve had a little bit of a quasi injury situation with Chucky heer and he is in the game right now because even a oneeyed Chucky haer and being in the game is better than being on the bench but give Eastern Kentucky all the credit for the fight that theyve showed here in the second half and it hasnt been only uh Taytay Blandon Jackson Holts been big George kimbells been Big Al the colonels were competitive for 25 to 30 minutes against both Clemson and pit lets see if they can be competitive for the full 40 with their ACC opponent today right but Louisvilles had the same problem though because of their short bench Tay Tay Bland pulls up rebound ripped down by Hadley thats good work by Hadley defending Bland and then grabbing the rebound hes the glue of this team hurn little fiddle and didd with a dribble Blitz in the ball screen this is where he loves to work spins on Myrick cant score over them though thats well done defensively by montus well he was at a height disadvantage and hes really good for passing out of the post which is what he should have done into the fourth quarter of this game Colonels havent beaten the Cardinals in over 60 years but theyve got a lead with 948 to play well at some point Louisville is going to have to make some threes weve been saying it all game Evan thats who they are and what they do and Terence Edwards who had 17 in the first half hes had two here in the second that last Bucket from Jordan Crawford back on the floor after missing the last couple of games with mono water man reestablishes the Cardinals Advantage just what the doctor ordered now one for eight in the second half maybe that takes the lid off Waterman Hedges the ball screen this is Crawford hes an explosive guy bad pass taken by Smith fouled by Crawford and thats all Hadley defending Bandon this will be one in one for Louisville this is a good job here by Terence Edwards to not lose the basketball a little bit of a fumble pitching it around to heern and then in the corner to Waterman and the late close out by Blandon because he doesnt want to pick up his Music fourth Louisvilles free throw shooting has been a huge Plus for them 12 for 13 so far on the day and given the foul trouble thats accumulated for the colonels thats where Louisville could put this game away some blood on the shorts of Javon Hadley so he may need a quick costume change rain Smith about to shoot his first free throws of the game 91 free throw shooter looks the part as well close captioning for CW court side Saturday brought to you by Sketchers basketball comfort that performs wow I guess is that on you or on me no definitely you Ill take the credit cuz its our first time working together next time I get blamed for the really big stuff Ill give you the little stuff butry recovers near midcourt tell you whos working hard aw Hamilton over there on the EKU bench wall nearly banks in the three heres Chucky heurn the other way look for Smith instead Waterman same spot heurn look forth stinks he was open twice especially off the offensive rebound Smith Goes Down they got the foul on either butri or Myrick Music Applause two on him weve got wall with three Kimble with three and Blandon with threei shoot I guarantee rain Smith will make two free throws I give you my personal guarantee theres no way hes missing the second one its it was its literally impossible that he would make the second you trying to personally alienate you still got to fly out of this city later today I told you look at that oh wow he had it the whole way hes just playing gutsy stuff zth Davis respect look at that free throw differential though plus nine and yet the Colonels hanging around big possession here Cardinals up in the intensity defensively Myck hand off for Kimble tough shot wont go Waterman Rises up for the rebound James Scott didnt get the rebound but it his box out and seal on the Baseline that created the opportunity its a great point hes had a good second half strong take counted and one this is Chuckys house if you check your watch its Chucky o clock because when it comes to winning time thats where you want the ball oh bullying his way to the basket the finish and the free throw coming Music up close captioning for CW Courtside Saturday is brought to you by sketchs basketball comfort that performs my game is original My Style is original so why would I wear the same kicks as everybody else Elite Performance Allstar quality new sketches Music basketball the booking app like a good neighbor State Farm is Music there lets take a look at todays key play brought to you by Hilton Hilton for the stay and the key play was not Chucky heper getting hit in the eye at least for Louisville but how he responded to it has been key yeah a little bit of a dicey situation cuz he was on the bench I dont know if that was just part of his regular rotation or if they were worried about the eye or what was going on cuz theres no question when you get to the end of the game and youre in a tight spot where the balls got to go that doesnt mean hes going to score it but you want the ball in his hands to be able to get things going so good on him to have the wherewithal not to fire up a threepoint shot I love that you brought up Chucky time cuz how many games in a badger Jersey was he the man down the stretch in the Big 10 and thats thats what you talk about teams forming an identity thats your identity because you might not have necessarily an outstanding game I mean hes had a good game hes got 12 points on four of eight two for five from three five assists solid game also five turnovers though thats the fly in the ointment no no question but when it comes down to it you got to go to its a 9 nothing run for Louisville after they trailed by two Tay Tay Blandon the goto guy for EKU kicks it to nobody nobody was wide open not sure where he was you know what there was actually a Louisville cheerleader who came to get something I think he was trying to pass it to her I Applause do chance for Louisville to really throw the knockout punch these next few minutes she even has blonde hair I think he may have thought it was halt Hadley back pedals over to heurn heres that zone looking again switching things up very smartly out of the timeout Waterman into the lane short rebound trck by Scott oo and he throwed it was looking to you well yeah head burn cut you off you dont want to give it to me but Im not sure he totally reestablished himself when he came in bounds it was close 19 offensive rebounds in the game Second Chance points have been prior to the story theres the 20th offensive rebound for Louisville I think this going on on Blandon its his fourth and again James Scott drawing the foul with the box out and Bandon got whistled for trying to shove him out of the way I like what Ive seen from James Scott this Applause half only two points for Scott but nine rebounds seven of his rebounds at the offensive end CW Sports Saturday continues at the top of the hour well take you to the Dome up in central New York Bucknell and Syracuse with Tom wormy and John Henson and then we shift gears to the grid iron the Snoop Dog Arizona Bowl presented by DIN and Juice the Red Hawks and the Rams CW Sports Saturday continues all day long only on the CW one for two for Scott land playing with four missed it Tay T is now 9 for 19 and that would go to whoever blandons going right now its Smith looking for Applause SC Chucky he with the perfect feed 120 run for Louisville Kimble tries to quiet the crowd and aw Hamilton takes the time out and just like that its a sevenpoint game again with six minutes to play and the colonels are back in it yeah aw Hamilton is not thrilled with Tyler Andrews for leaving his man there look at Chucky heurn Andrews just in no mans land there you either got to stop the ball or stop the man and he stopped neither but give heurn credit for the fine beautiful pass his sixth assist and a fine finish for James Music Scott now there are College of Charleston transfers we should have mentioned this earlier on both of these teams so a lot of guys that Kelsey is very familiar with from last year here on CW Courtside Saturday its brought to you in part by healthcaregov new law lower prices enroll today both myar wall and Jordan Crawford played for Pat Kelce at College of char last year and you talk about aw Hamilton and his rise in the industry he is proud to have played for the winningest high school basketball coach in the in the history of Kentucky High School Hoops Billy Hicks recruited by Dave odm to Wake Forest played a semester for skip froster as well then finished his collegiate career at Marshall taken under Kevin keatss Wing took over for Kevin at hardgrave and now the head coach here at EKU hes in his seventh year hes the reigning Aon Coach of the Year archabald William Hamilton 44 year old who corn and bread here in Kentucky Louisville doing its best work I think today from the foul line 17 for 20 and Easter kuy is only 6 for seven so youre plus 11 on the line and youre plus seven on the scoreboard and thats made up for their bad threepoint shooting here in the second half 1 for 10 from behind the ark and heres the Zone again from Eastern Kentucky largely because of the foul trouble I think chuggy heurn unable to bust the zone and a good rebound inside there by Myrick also 20 offensive rebounds today for Louisville so their hustle stats have been really good Kimble contested three way Applause off Devon Hadley he been a real solid player all game long hes got 15 and Music nley chose not to go to work on Myrick right away now he will good no call there he jumps straight up five rebounds for Myra EKU hanging around good hands but staying with it Kimble cuts it to five been a lot more Kimble here in the second half than Blandon Kimbles got nine in the second Applause half after these five minutes its conference play from here on out for both teams how will this thing finish up oo pretty good hands from hul they got him for the foul and thatll send Chucky heer into line for Two Shots Cardinals now in the double Music bonus heper reverting now to Wisconsin basketball and I mean that as as a compliment he SE during these free throws Im curious to ask from your National perspective what in your mind are the biggest college basketball story lines as we head into 2025 well I think the number one thing that jumps out to me is the strength of the SEC I dont know that Ive seen a stronger conference than what were seeing in Auburn and Tennessee at the top of the polls and what Mark Pope has done at uh Kentucky I dont know if Louisville fans want us necessarily talking about it out loud maybe just do hand signals but you got to be impressed with what hes been able to do and here in the ACC I think Duke is is a legit National Championship Contender the way they defend with their size their physicality the way John Shire used the portal to get older see Scott now guarding glanton glantons got those four fouls so hes got to be quieter Kimbell for three got it threepoint game with 412 to go Chucky he got caught behind he came around the curl the hand off little bit of daylight was all he Applause needed Edwards to answer rebounded by Myrick Edwards only two here in the second half after going for 17 in the first Louisville with only one three in the second half after making nine in the first one for 12 since halftime for the to the lead rebounded by Chucky heern that would have been for the tie B your Applause Music Parton remember I asked whats Plan B were looking at Plan B for Louisville Chucky to Edwards Cardinals turned it over we shall see if Plan B is good enough against the team from Richmond about 90 minutes down the road George Kimbell thei makes it a threepoint game down the stret back here at the Yum Center Louisville clinging to a threepoint lead with 316 to play Lets get you caught up with todays game summary presented by Pacific Life creating Financial Security for nearly 160 years Seth Davis yes sir and not enough of that for Louisville they are 1 for 12 from three in the second half theyre going to have to find some other ways to win theyve done it at the foul line and putting the ball in Chucky heers hands usually good things happen but the colonels of Eastern Kentucky do not know how to quit George Kimbell has been fantastic here in the second half and whats interesting is in the first half Taytay Blandon had 16 for Easter Kent Kentucky Terence Edwards 17 for Louisville second half Blandon for Edwards two so that script has flipped but it happened to both teams its why we got a game and you see the threepoint shooting there oh what a shot for Kimble hard Landing for wall but he pops right back up onepoint game 14 for Kimble in the second half hes got 21 in the ball game leading all scores Music Edwards had a big first half quieter here in the second missed it with the left Myrick another rebound its just odd to see him lose confidence pull the trigger on that three BL like a freight train can he get downhill on Scott pivots past him and gives the colonels the lead you called it Evan hes got Scott on skates thats a mismatch how will Louisville handle this moment in their final nonconference game theyre sitting at seven and five eastern kys been switching between man and his Zone bra Smith circles it down big bucket theres that three ball breaks seven nothing run hell never stop shooting no sir here we go partner final two minutes winning time time out EKU aw uses his penultimate timeout a message for Jackson Holt what a battle this has turned out to be 10 lead changes weve got back and forth here in the second half Blandon puts the colonels up but rain Smith with the answer from M Corner classic swinging the ball back to heon over to Smith in the corner hes been operating in one corner Waterman in the other now two for 13 in the second half from three for Louisville but I think you closed this thing out on the foul line not the threepoint line and if youre Eastern Kentucky youre worried about the defensive glass as well I mentioned it earlier the last time that Eastern Kentucky beat Louisville it was 2 weeks after the JFK assassination December of Applause 1963 Louisvilles won the last 10 needings since 1964 they havent played every year over the last half century the way they did in the previous 50 years heres blant on Scott again clear it out let him go blant fade away in and out offensive rebound though from Myrick Hadley couldnt quite grab it Campbell lost it recovers tenda shoot this is for the lead he got it oh goodness James Scott not getting out there on him big time shot from George Kimbell III they got to get heurn going downhill Music funny that Chucky hasnt touched it but they get it to Smith who missed it whos it off of its louisv ball says Tony Henderson theyre going to go look at this now theyre going to take a look Louisville ball is the call on the floor look at James Scott hes got to go get up on him but hes so afraid of the drive and he had his hands down thats a big time shot by Kimbell now 17 in the second half previous players under review for out of bounds theres a big review here sure is one minute even remaining what what do we know what the call was what direction they saidon Henderson signaled Louisville ball Louisville ball so there needs to be enough evidence to overturn but he didnt look overly confident and Clare Aubry the Baseline official looked at him immediately and said lets review it big replay here memb got to be Applause Music enough I think Tony got it right yeah I think so too it looked like it was out on Music wall havent seen anything there that would make me feel like it should be overturned and clearly Waterman is out front yeah thats off wall that should be EAS after releas the play is confirmed its basketball out of bounds under the basket with 20 seconds on the shot off now one of the good things about these reviews even though Im not crazy about them is that just gave Louisville the free timeout they didnt have to burn of timeout they get a fresh 20 and they get a chance to figure something out so I think heern throws it in and you get it back to him you get him a ball screen and let him go downhill once he gets into the paint he can pitch it out or he can try to finish at The Rim in four days the Tar Heels will be here to begin 202 he got shov I mean Waterman got shoved into him how will the Cardinals finish today against the colonels heurn had it stripped its loose on the floor Arrow belongs to Louisville and its a jump ball that will keep it with the Cardinals with just four and a half from the shot clock Big Time Break to have the possession arrow going their way no ball screen there for Heen looked like Waterman got shoved by the defender no call come on oh good hands by wall knock it away he bur dive it on top ties him up timeout taken by Pat Kelce and for those of you joining us looking for the start of the Bucknell Syracuse game well get you to the Dome after we finish up here in Louisville tip off for that game scheduled for 21 Eastern so stay with us right here on the CW as well take you to the bison and the orange when we conclude its a big key here Evan is where they inbound the ball I think its going to be on the Baseline so its a classic Baseline out of bounds play but this is something with 4 and 12 seconds you got to draw something Music up and Id say go with the hot hand but there really isnt one right now for theil before we get to the hot hand our player of the game brought to you by Progressive Insurance save when you bundle Auto home and motorcycle insurance visit progressivecom its Tay Tay blanson who moved into fourth in the all time KU scoring chart doing an inside and outside yeah hes been fantastic as has Kimble Kimble has 17 here in the second half so theyve been ham and egging their way through Whoever has the better mismatch there but Bandon loves that midrange game spinning back to his right shoulder as a righthanded shooter which is not easy to do for the season those two Blandon and Kimbell average 312 a game today theyve got 46 combined which is what they needed to battle an ACC team like this and keep it close down the stretch they got a onepoint lead when I talked to Pat Kelsey yesterday he was worried about this team he was worried about those two guys didnt know their names it was 10 and three hes the numbers guy he said 10 and three are really good they hunt theyre veterans they know what to do so it is a baseline out of bounds once again heern is the inbounder cuz hes your decision maker he quickly in the Smith back to heurn this is for the lead they were going two for one they couldnt get the first but theres an 11se second difference between the game and shot clock so they do not need to foul you want to defend without fouling and then the Ki could be the defensive rebound clearing out right now for Blandon if they needed a foul by the way Cardinals still have a foul to give you want to get the ball screen to try to get the switch theres the switch blon wants this shot so bad three to shoot Tay Tay Blandon Miss fires rebound finds heurn ahead to Smith with eight Smith lost it to the corner Waterman with three Waterman to the basket L the leads with 12 to go wow all kinds of collisions bouncing around ends up in Watermans hands using all 61 Smith looked at the bench like did he want to timeout no call on the collision with HK tough Applause take that was the question about whether Smith committed an offensive foul on the drive I definitely agree there was no foul on on the finish I dont think Holt committed a foul and it certainly wasnt offensive the question is whether the foul there on Smith yeah I think he got out the way with one there partner I got to be honest good recognition by Waterman who almost stepped out with his left theres a lot going on this is like the srer film can we back this up I want to see if Waterman stepped out you cant Advance it in mens college basketball like you can and womens college troops are the NBA which I agree with by the way you got to earn those 94 ft Andrews to throw it and now time out Louisville this is the final timeout for the Cardinals lets do the zuder Phil watch his left foot did he hit that Baseline hes got dark shoes no well give it to him well give it to him its really close but dont wear dark thats why dont wear dark shoes just in case that comes up in great job guys great job finding that awesome Applause Music angle oh just a few minutes away from tip off in Syracuse Bucknell and the orange but some business to to conclude here with 12 left so the the the first decision most people would say right now we should put a defender on the ball Pat Kelce wanted to see what they had designed and so he is now going to put James Scott on the ball which by the way I you could go either way but the fact that the the player is allowed to run the Baseline because it was a made basket so that kind of negates the Baseline uh Defender so lets see where they go obviously between Blandon and Kimble thats where you want to go although Hol might have a good look here in front of us number 11 Andrews throws it up near midcourt intercepted by Edwards Hes fouled by Kimble point four to go clearly a foul on Kimble kind of a No Mans Caleb Williams throw there to nobody and Louisville is going to get out of here with an escape Bears fans catching strace Im sorry its just what happened Applause Edwards didnt score much but he made the defensive play when it mattered most the rebound looks like Louisville is going to escape as two shots arguably better off missing right now because Eastern does not have any timeouts and at 04 they are allowed to catch the ball at 03 youre not need to throw at the length of the Court immediately missed it blant for the game its short and Louisville escapes and wins their final game of the year 7876 over Eastern Kentucky Escape is definitely the word and who
