nine of their last 11 Tuesday against Wake Forest is the first time in three and 1 half decades that the NC State Wolf Pack won a game without making a three they have not shot the ball well from Deep lately and yet aside from that Carolina game they still are a really hot basketball team we are underway its great to have you with us as Virginia Tech begin sha padulla matched up with Jaden Taylor saw Rees beakman give padulla some problems like hes given to a lot of offensive players in the league first shot of the day wont go for MJ Applause Collins like said he put He start Taylor on padulla its going to be a good match up today he says hes the head of the snake he said in the open the engine that makes them go DJ burns the biggest guy on the floor revers is for horn Coutures got that match up horn floater no burns put back yes big fell down there he hasnt been fing well lately but he looked good right there where they like to get him going early especially in games it gets his engine going gets him rolling a little bit hell play a little hard Applause defensively dont manage 10 points despite being a little under the weather dealing with a stomach bug on Tuesday against wake great defense by Casey Morel getting a piece of the hunter Couture Applause 3 DJ horn with the drive seals off on the backside nice final left you got to help the helper guy with the help on burns someones got to block him out easier said than done they did not give DJ horn the assist there it was an offensive rebound for DJ Burns shot clock winding down Robbie Barons been playing better lately CH clock violation good good defense by n State me and EV talked earlier Virginia Tech struggles with length on the perimeter and length you know just in general so itll be interesting to see if they can get around that today and uh try to get a win on the road the hokes know that ncate is going to bring the pressure you know full court a lot of the game c working on the Press they might pull that out a little Applause later Burns pass drills the net hit the bottom of the rim and the Deep ball way too far for MJ Collins yikes bur has done that a last hes tried to throw a crosscourt pass and hit the rim the rim has not moved since the start of the game a long time ago so hes got to figure that Applause out well pack one for two so far NC State is able to score 50 points in the paint against wake on Tuesday night and the bench outscored the deacons bench 302 the performances from modara Ben Middlebrooks being really consequential in the effort story of the game the bench outperformed and out tough wa for us his starters you sure did oh sneaking in for the rebound and Taylor puts it in Great hustle from The Freshman Dennis Parker Dennis Parker struggled lately offensively so thats something to get you going offensive rebound get a nice pass nice play to get the energy going here comes the full court press John here it comes looks like theyre doing a man full court press now in practice they want to funnel you to the corners just across half and trap you lets see if they do the same thing today Baron throws it away stolen by morcel but he stepped on the Baseline so the hook dodge a bullet there NC State is top 15 in the country in turnover margin this is what they do right here Kevin Keats wore a mask on Tuesday cuz he was feeling a little under the weather starts today without left the mask he was a parttime mask wearer in practice yesterday when he had something to say he take the mask off to make sure he was heard they look good in practice and they were sharp yesterday padulla on the drive blocked by Burns last Touch by Virginia Tech it has been a great start for the wol fat as we see that length is affecting Virginia Tech Padula is trying to be aggressive theyre on to him right now hes got to figure it out in there maybe it out for for his Shooters Hokies are 0 for five and sure if theres a clock issue but the officiating crew Roger SS Tommy morresy and Shan Hull are holding everything up for a moment looks like a NC States defense is picking up where they left off the shot clock to our right is at 90 and that thats an issue yes that that is a long long time to run the offense we talked about the 12 to 10 NC State game the lowest scoring game ever against Duke back in the day 9 second shot clock remind me in Pace for that so were going to get an early uh early stoppage an early timeout whether they make an immediate timeout or not remains to be seen you know in the aftermath of Tuesday night NC stayed out toughed Wake Forest that was a huge part of the story the officials were also a huge part of the story the word of the week for state has been toughness maybe technicals with with what transpired late in that game and also with Kevin Keith just before halftime hey dont quote me but I think that technical was strategic to get his team rolling and maybe have the referee that made that call kind of understand hey now the eyes are on you make some better calls well the first one was strategic the second one was unexpected but kudos to Kareem Richardson former head coach at Kansas City up to steer the wolf pack to that big win and 13 win of the Year stepping into the jumper Jaden Taylor transfer from Butler hes a great defender but offensively man hes good he led them in scoring last year and 44 gam started and his h k Bor B Im sorry Butler Lin kid gets the first two of the day for Virginia Tech I love Lin kid man hes got to get going he hes one of the best has one of the best two shooting percentages in the country man he needs to be a lot more aggressive as they said every you take only took three field goal attempts in Charlottesville long range shot wont go for Taylor hes got nice size he good athlete as well padulla unforced turnover yep padulla trying to argue Taylor right here good screen by DJ Burns loses it that helped him kind of get off balance right here Li K with a nice nice screen by Couture which will go not go on the stat sheet but that got his guy and wide open dunp kadulla argued to no avail that Jaden Taylor knocked it away middle Brooks coming off his best game as a member of the wolf pack 14 points six rebounds in 20 minutes he did not miss a shot he was perfect five for five from the field four for four from the free throw line you had the n one to kind of close that game off just way for is it an an one if you are ejected before you can shoot the free throw yeah you know what I dont think so I mean that was like a fourpoint possession to kind of close the game so youre right he scored two to win that LE for game yeah it was the Sharpshooter Michael ell that came in knocked down the free throw Hunter Couture speaking of Sharp Shooters hey hes a shooter thats what he does 41 from three Nice Shot man his 291st alltime threepointer hes already number one in hokey history and today he ties Malcolm Delaney for the most games played ever in Virginia Tech lore I still have nightmares of him when I played he had game didnt he he took care of us his my freshman year Mo diara his first attack and the foul is going against Virginia Techs maai long and we will get our first break Star Wars theme the light saers out in full force here at PNC onepoint game early next the action continues on CW court side Saturday

we take you all the way back to March 4th 1989 it was 15 games ago in NC State history its the last time NC State won without making a three they scored 110 points it helped the game went to four overtimes John it was the first quadruple overtime game in ACC history and uh two good friends Jim Valvano and Bob stack at the end embracing what what a game that was three halves essentially yeah and our statistical experts John Madre and Freddy Kyer were working that game in March of 1989 and they are working this game here today its great to have that institutional memory hey he was our I I I wanted to say with him before the game and just talk man he he was an encyclopedia for us man ACC basketball encyclopedia y so NC State jumped out six nothing hokes have scored the last five Brandon rein are into the game for the first time oh great defense Jaden Taylor the steal but he cannot finish at the other end rebound for Kor jayen Taylor is is is affecting this game defensively I mean hes almost taking over defensively guarding these these guards for Virginia Tech I think folks around the league are starting to recognize how impactful he is defensively middle Brooks gets a piece of it smacks it away inside right here middle Brooks with the recovery didnt stop got his hand on the ball beautiful beautiful recovery by middle Brooks hes hes been playing well as of Music late not where they want to get kid the ball near the threepoint Arc shot clocks down to eight Tyler nickel flips it inside back outside niichel for three UNC transfer he is a volume threepoint shooter sit at about 67 he is where the game is going they need him to play well and he is not shy made a three in 10 consecutive ball games its an 8 nothing run for Virginia Music Tech Taylors been phenominal defensively offensively hes now two for five hes certainly looking to be aggressive early in this Applause game had a little that was a heat heat check before going to the bench got a little shimmy this game man I like it this just got a finish it off as we know midrange is not where the game is going these days its threes and layups oh Rex Steiner has his pocketed picked again DJ horn the stealing the score horn not necess known for his defense Reen Stein is going to happen another turnover in the back court Mike young needs a timeout You think you see he had to get padulla back in the game theyre struggling with this pressure from NC state coach young choosing to let him play morcel his first points of the day assisted by okono turnovers have been an issue for Virginia Tech they lead the the league with around 15 turnovers a game in conference play thats the seventh in the first seven minutes TN for three that shot is going to go down eventually you got to think great pass by con sucking in the defense and kicking it out the horn whos their best threepoint shooter crowd was ready to erupt Couture battling for position next Steiner giving it away on the dribble thats got to linger in his mind kid to long oh what defense on the Block diara and middle Brooks are becoming like the batch Brothers for NC State defensively know you look at the score theyre only up Music two strong side of Def on middle Brooks y holds his ground two hands up middle Brooks follows him up great team defense ly kids got to crash the boards on that as well he cant keep back up Tech needs all the shots they can get today four blocks already by in state four blocks four steals games not even seven minutes old nickel to Long going Baseline and its a shock block violation the eighth Pokey turnover call me crazy but its inter state becoming a defensive team right before our eyes thats how they won the other night he Middlebrooks finished that game for them Burns junor was out with the stomach bug and he made some big big plays also got someone to too man himself as Music well I like the kind of nice switch up from Burn to spot middle Brooks travel this Applause time turnover number three for n State there the numbers in graphic form six rebounds to go along with a careerhigh 14 points she St press again just trying to get Virginia Tech to use up some shot clock so not as much time to run the offense maybe speed them up a little Applause bit Couture kicks it long way off its not his game hes now 0 for 12 Beyond The Arc this season is it too rude to say he could play for NC State yes it is too Applause soon nichel usually a shooter this time the attack works out and one Tyler nichel little Brooks tried to time it up Tyler nichel a decent athlete hes got some good size nice thr head right here middle Brooks could have may a position on that but uh not known as a shot blocker not known as a shot blocker he might have overextended himself on out you could see it in the body language nickel hesitated for a split second hes like am I going to do this yes yes yes I am and it worked out beautiful finish got the body alltime leading score in Virginia High School basketball hey scored more points than Ai and JJ re doesnt doesnt even sound right does Applause it only scored 52 points last year for Carolina but six points today hes got now 151 points this year and if he gets hot he can be really dangerous DJ Burns back into the game the big fella sees the double the kick out for okell double team Virginia Tech is double teaming DJ burns on the move so he needs to set them up and be nowhere to the open man is coming from and make the right pass which he did on that possession threepoint drought continues here at PNC Arena for the wolf pack I wonder if theyre exerting so much energy defensively its affecting their offensive output from the threepoint line tough shot Shan padulla his first two of the game hes been on the role lately as we stated the reigning ACC player of the week so despite eight turnovers so far the hes have a threepoint lead doesnt make sense if youre not looking at score you think an state has a lead but great vision from DJ Burns and its Parker laying it in nice pass by Burns an underrated passer for this NC State team especially from the free throw line at there but his first assist of the day averages right around three assists per game oh and its burns the steel taking it away from padulla big fella with the Finish Mike Young and the entire Virginia Tech staff cannot believe that there was not a whistle NC State in state is feasy on their guards from Virginia Tech to Baron for two was such a strange feel of the first 10 minutes of this game hey you guys cant see it at home but cam Woods is smiling when hes guarding padulla man he hes loving this youve seen Defenders getting up in the grill of ball handlers so far today shot clock winding down Burns need the threepoint Applause line tough fatal away oh thats Nifty that is maybe the rest from him not practicing got him feeling good hes got some good legs good energy nice fade I think P Jor Tech will live with that shot though such a soft touch kid throws it in P the foul first on burns and Virginia Tech has weathered the initial storm here in Music Raleigh burs with the steel the Nifty feet coming in that was all caused by the pressure by cam Woods Lyn kit with the Finish nice finish dunk and one beautiful Music so Robo curly fire in my chest got soft skin heart feelings give it reason po top Music feel all right okay I did it my Music way

you by Pacific Life creating Financial Security for more than 150 years long past time that David Thompson is officially immortalized over by Reynolds Coliseum the three time ACC Player of the Year a legendary career and just a forever one of the alltime greats hes a legend man we uh we know about Im Im its before my time but I know who David Thompson is what a weird first 104 weve had kid sinks the three free throw completes the threepoint play Virginia Tech leads 18 16 weve had seven lead changes so far John and Virginia Tech has nine turnovers and they have the lead by two I tried to look at stats I cant make sense of it but thats why thats basketball for you right there on the threepoint drought continues for NC State here at PNC Arena its got to be in their heads a little bit right it might be and uh you know they got to keep shooting and eventally theyll fall especially here at home the last made three at PNC came with 1121 to go in the second half of the Carolina game and and it was the unlikely shooter modara that knocked it down I was I was at yard house watching that game so thats a long time ago sure you enjoyed that final result but we dont have to get into it too much now padulla two Defenders running Adam burns the third Defender closing out on him on the drive and a turnover number 10 for the hokes I will say if anti State keeps turning them over at this rate they will eventually turn the tit on this game offensively and and this could get ugly so officially its 16 straight missed threes in game action here at PNC for the wolf pack and theyll have probably hit the next one now that weve talked about it right everybody will exhale if they do when they do eligal potit strong take earning free throws and DJ Burns just picked up his second personal solid big Off the Bench especially last game he looked really good out there you know the the value of diara in Middle Brooks Off the Bench you think of a team like Miami you know nor Chad omir picks up his second foul with 853 to go in the first half its a its a nightmare for Jim Lena in the Hurricanes but to have the depth of those big bodies off the bench its gigantic yeah it means a lot and Coach Keats told us that he he really wants Burns only to play 20 to 25 minutes if he can tonight so with that stumble bug of him not practicing middle Brooks is a perfect compliment to what they need to do down there one for two at the line for Music potit Tex pushing him out on the perimeter offensively thats never good I hope he will get after you defensively edging the ball screen five to shoot for DJ horn middle Brooks reverses to the corner Taylor no Marcel did he get it off he did not Tommy morresy and the crew wave it off theyre going to review it but I think it was the correct call as you said EV earlier that was not a pass air Balls always the toughest thing to box out on as well cuz you might have position and the ball just doesnt go you away theyre going to take the time out now

the officials are still looking at the monitor to determine whether Casey morcel got this off in time its very close but I think the call of a shot clock violation is going to stand yeah looks like you did not get it off in time another good look for three that would not fall for the wolf pack there is a lid on that basket for NC State its got to keep shooting they will eventually fall well on a day when they were over eight from three on Tuesday they were 29 of 46 from two thats a robust Applause 63 you stay back in the Press I think I found a discrepancy theyve only got eight points off 10 turnovers I think thats the story of the game theyve got to capitalize on some of these extra possessions the other thing is no one has scored off the NC State bench getting this Applause game its early lot of basketball still to play Collins inside potit rejected but theyre going to get a foul on middle Brooks and that is his second personal second hes a cop shes a con and together this unlikely Duo makes the perfect pair watch all new episodes of wild cards every Wednesday 87 Central only on the CW and you can stream for free right now on the Applause CWF potit senior originally from Reedsville transferred from rice to blackburg Couture takes a rest on the bench I dont think hell be over there long Evan no hes out in 31 minutes a game largest lead so far for The hokes Who trailed six nothing out of the gate theyre holding on right now States got to just capitalize some of the offensive possessions and uh not turn it over theyve got seven themselves long two for horn would and go strong rebound for kid here comes padulla padulla floats it high tough catch great adjustment in the air and tremendous athleticism and Poise showed by MJ Collins savy play Man uh usually someone will try to finish that for him to come down and finish that high level athleticism shown by Collins that people you know might not think he made eye contact with padulla and pointed it up on the way down three1 of the loss he thought he was going to throw it to midle of three middle Brooks turns it over hope hes on an 880 run right he had nickl in the corner but twos are better than threes any day of the Music week spoken like a true big Applause man I know by the end of your NBA career you became more of a threepoint shooter cuz the coach has kind of made you practice and become that right oh bu hoser called me and said you need to shoot threes so thats what I did all summer playing with JIS you have to be able to shoot with three for him to be successful and to be a good team how many threes did you take in high school I dont remember not a lot a small number though small number I shot thre in high school but you know thats like a midrange jumper these days and lines all the way back its a whole different ball game both pack have not scored in over three minutes run y morcel on the drive oh top finish up and under Marcel first down on the court today usually that translates to a good game or or buckets going in for you thats something you always look for right when you get to the arena I always look for Marcel Burns padulla and Couture or the first four guys on the court today and it translates was that you in your playing career hey later in my playing career once I learned I wish I knew earlier honestly kid backing down diara rebound for M I like his aggression though he has to stay aggressive kids two for four smacks it away Marcel rips Baseline no help comes he has a finish on the other side on two guys that was a tough finish by him Virginia Tech game always means a little bit more for Casey morel started his career in Music Charlottesville diara versus Kid coach Kei talk to us yday diara he said he thinks hes a three I think hes a five we put him at the four I like that Kevin Keats year seven at NC State hes been ejected twice this year thats never happened before in his basketball coaching career kind of laughed about it its not something hes trying to do might be part of the strategy the the offensive rebound off The Horn Miss DJ horn one for Music six horn dishes diara for two nice shot took his time there kind of froze the defender when he look to pass nice midrange jumper first bench bucket for the W Pat kid in transition clobber theyre going to count the continuation yes Kevin Keats cant believe it but this call goes Virginia Techs way and an and one opportunity for ly kid I dont think its any secret you know Lyn kid right here taking his time and finish him hes playing well Virginia T is up five this is what do you think John the first time this game is the first time hes got to the free throw line in five games so hes played a lot of hes playing Ultra Applause aggressive are you okay with that continuation being an n one Im okay with that he was going up right by the basket M kid looks like hes someone talked to him in the locker room he said hey we need to be aggressive yeah eight points for kid hes only been averaging about 6 and 12 per game in the last two weeks and includes a game which he shot 8 for eight against Miami Morel Fade Away comes up short a lot of midrange jumpers for NC State I think Virginia Tech defensively will live with that contested midrange jumper every day of the Music Applause week MJ Collins pull up and BR te back with the midrange contested jumper I think these teams are defensively playing really well right now I agree with you diara going to work on the Block scores two on K hes been trending up nice middle Drive spin finish with the inside hand hes finally binding his role coach Kei said and thats whats making them play better on the offensive end and in general 13 rebounds in the weight game he had 11 rebounds off the bench at Louisville last Applause Saturday padulla needs to shoot recognizes knew it was off as soon as it left his hands and it was out of bounds off kid W Pack basketball goes on not goes unmentioned he was the number one jco recruit in the country so Kevin Keat on the recruiting TR I talked to I I talked to a former coach he said hes a monster on the recruiting Trail so Burns right here he he just needs to Horn Im sorry horn keys to keep being Music aggressive maybe they did get him in some more sets offensively good look from the corner Casey mois circles it in Hallelujah the crow Goes Wild that was an interminable drought but a steal for horn the dish and the bucket for okono defense tur into an offense its they capitalize on those turnovers thats how theyre going to win this game cently up the point 70 run in the last 70 Applause seconds another steal the 12th hope po turnover diara Stripped by padulla Pooky with numbers the other way niichel for three got it hes feeling good it looked good from the time he left his hand where he sitting at what a huge swing right there as the hoky retake the lead on the Tyler nickel triple coach Keat probably not not really too happy y took it Coast to Coast I dont think Burns is happy either nice pass by horn this looked good from the time the left his hand Applause cash when moderate to severe ulcerative colitis takes you off course put it in

Applause back Music Applause Music Applause Music lets take a look at our Pacific Life game summary presented by Pacific Life creating Financial Security for more than 150 years Wolfpack got off to a phenomenal start LED 6 nothing in the early minutes nice dime by Burns and then a fast break layup from a perimeter still you dont hear that a lot about a big man so that was fun to see the Virginia Tech has rallied back Couture hit the first three for the wol pack Tyler Nichols hit a couple the great equalizer at a threepoint shot this is why Virginia Tech is up two points at the moment had nine lead changes in this first half hes have a twopoint lead despite 12 turnovers out of the timeout DJ horn looking to get going great defense by Hunter Couture hes underrated Defender hes their best defender on the perimeter and I dont think its a secret that burns is struggling right now due to his defense oh conell picked the dribble as he was falling to his backside and a reaching foul is going against long its number two on maai Long well catch our breath and remind you that coming up on the Subaru halftime report we will hear from the duo calling the North Carolina BC game Tom wormy and Mike jinsky getting set up at Cony for him in Chestnut Hill also look ahead to ACC womens basketball tomorrow Virginia Tech womens basketball coming off a final four last season weve got them on the CW tomorrow against Clemson stadium was packed in the last Tech womens game its sold out for most games these days Kenny Brooks has it rolling concerned about Georg Amore though the star point guard injured on Thursday night against Duke hope shell be okay Finish nice seal by Fati just couldnt finish nine times out of 10 that goes in Horn defended well by padulla jimy B standed UPA play some great defense on horn DJ horn now one for seven from the field oh for four from three was a little bit forced I think he was kind of feeling a little down about that good defense by badulla hes missed his last 11 threepoint attempts here at PNC but he went 6 for nine at Louisville last Saturday BS and flows of basketball Hokies are in the bonus so itll be one in one here for Virginia Tech Im uh pretty uh it took this long to call it a reach in for uh in state theyve been reaching all day on uh pul and the guard so first on Taylor finally CAU up to him and the hokei only shot four free throw attempts in 40 minutes in Charlottesville poke fans are like yeah we never get the calls at jpg see if guar heels get any calls up in Chestnut Hill today RJ Davis leads the fourth ranked North Carolina Tar Heels into Connie porn to take on the Boston College Eagles coming up next exclusively here on the CW its always a tricky game traveling up there to ches Hill snow on the ground I remember I did a Carolina BC game four or five years ago they were top five in the country it was the Kobe white year and uh uh I was just impressed with the tarel fans showing up in Boston like it felt like a not not quite like the dean dome but it felt like a UNC home game in there they come out they come out man everywhere we go they come out of course the NC State fans and look what has your relationship been like with NC State fans Through The Years lets get that out there its been a decade its a lot less hostile now Im on the other side I talked to some fans today theyre say hey Im calling the game I said look my other side I come in peace you respect their passion though right I love the setup here a crazy place to play um when this place is rocking its a tough place to play diara banging with potit poked away whos ball NC State ball five to shoot I love the aggression di is showing hes not getting necessary the fall or getting shots but thatll RAR he has a big man especially with the fouls nice back door cut and DJ horn gets an easy two off the nice Cut using that overplay by padulla to cut back door its a great basketball play high IQ play by DJ horn maybe thatll get him going Evan see the ball go in two for eight four points does have two assists Shan Padulas got four points spinning in the lane hanging in there in and out potit on the backboard oh no would have been the second foul on Dr if it was called it was not potit scores anyway its a big fell right there I would have had trouble with him was Applause play take a deep breath everybody timeout NC State 294 left there have been a lot of great Legends of basketball in the ACC Through The Years both on the court and Courtside NC State radio broadcaster Gary H has been calling games for the W pack since 1990 hes done over 400 football games over a thousand mens basketball games and hes a really excellent technical playbyplay announcer obviously he has been the voice of the pack for generations of NC State fans and hes retiring at the end of this year so salute to G working with Tony Haynes over there he hes I dont want to say hes one of my mentors cuz I dont know him that well but hes a role model cuz I always got to listen to him when Im in the car in this area cuz you get better as a playbyplay announcer listening to Gary yeah hes uh been doing it since the day I was born a year I was born so uh thats pretty pretty Applause crazy hes probably seen me in here a few Applause Music times interesting move by an state okano whos a more of an assist guy 3 to2 assist rti in ACC number three three Rs thought up that step 3 and 12 4 second differential game in shot clock oconnell has got nothing going so far too much dribbling three on pass puts in the three right on time thats why he was in the game right there great by coach pets he hadnt played in any of NC States last five games and he comes off the bench in the final seconds of the half to be the three to bring NC credit Hunter Couture hes playing great defense on him he is Virginia Techs best Virginia Defender you could say the same thing about Jaden Taylors defense on John padulla right yeah this kind of been defending each other to a stal May in a sense W pack begin the second half with possession looking to establish Burns inside picked up his second foul with 853 to go in the first half theres DJ horn knocking down the three right on time we knew that that this team would have been start knocking them down maybe not today but looks like they found her way from the threepoint line and DJ horn with another assist DJ BR Jr Im sorry with another assist to the perimeter just just call him DJ you got a great chance of being right if you call him Music DJ Collins cant connect his shooting struggles and games continue were told that he really lights it up in practice but it has not translated horn feeling good about himself after the bucket to start this half have a little spring in his step on the shot is falling DJ sets up the other DJ rebound for Collins see right here this perimeter pressure by Taylor you going check these probably set the screen to the front P to get him loose a little bit kid to the basket nice finish nice pass out the middle kid is doing his thing tonight finally as we was saying had 10 lead changes in this game this is our third tie 18 and2 minutes remaining horn similar spot and he knocks down another he told us in practice yesterday if he sees one or two go in its going up he is standing true to his word it was fun chatting with DJ horn asked him about the biggest difference between life here at NC State versus his first two stops at Arizona State and Illinois State first thing he mentioned were the fans Couture cant hit Taylor ahead Parker short you had to know that one was going up hit couple threes why not right DJ horn said it feels like it matters more here at NC State because of the fan support because of the passion at every single game throughout the season here in Raleigh take it from me I played in this Arena this is one of the top Arenas are play in from a perspective of a player and the fans around the court they get after it in the stands here second foul on Jaden Applause Taylor Couture kicks it Baron sticks it textbook basketball rip draw in to help kick it out to the corner three nothing but NE we got ourselves pretty good game here John Hanson 38 a piece Parker to answer and hell get the first free throw attempts of the day for NC State right here nice rejecting a screen from kid beautiful pass into the pocket by Couture thats got to go in if you play if you play enough that thats a shot that you take every time paren numbers have ticked up the last three games around 9 point6 rebounds per contest over the last week and a half tennis Parker has been relatively quiet offensively had the big game against Virginia two weeks ago only 14 points in the last three games since scoring 15 against the Wahoos as as a freshman its its tough man its ACC play hes started hes playing big minutes hes just got to keep pushing and keep going moving forward and uh shots will fall and hell get into a rhythm one for two at the line some full court press here light full court press from horn and the wol right here set the screen to get the pressure off thats what Virginia Tech needs to do to help their guards not turn the ball over when theyre bringing it down Padula only four points so far and he was bumped on his way to the rim hit the bottom of the backboard but NC State with an errant outlit PASS gives it away Burns Jor is in a movable Force but like we said these teams are not capitalizing on the other teams mistakes right there especially that fast Music break its fun to look at the history and the ramifications that are always at stake I mean if NC State wins today theyd be 61 in ACC play theyve never had that record in ACC play before ever its its hard to think about that not in the last 50 years historical you know relevance of this ET State basketball program 12 and0 1974 That season ended well nice AC of hands by for Applause to 10th turnover for the Wolf Pack pooki set up kid inside pulling out the chair Burns takes it away 13th turnover for Tech Burns is Savvy man I tell you Burns reverses for Taylor offensive foul tremendous defense from Hunter Couture he he has been playing tremendous defense today I think if youre NC State you have to Target padulla H Couture is not someone you want to Target on the defensive right here hes in position and this is a big foul here John the Third on Jaden Taylor hes going to go to the bench here 16 minutes to go as a Defender how does your mindset change knowing that youre playing with three and your value is your defensive energy its tough you have to be less aggressive now coming into the game and I would not be surprised if kadulla gets going now that he has a thats not as good as as Jaden Taylor well keep that point in mind 1601 in the second half Collins back outside padulla now oconnell has that defensive task Collins for three sticks it over horn right on time as you said hes been shooting it well in practice all week as a player eventually those shots to fall you have to keep shooting with confidence thats what hes doing that was a confident Stroke by him wol pack Give It Away saved near the sideline by Collins but they say he was out of bounds right in front of us thought we were embracing ourselves for a Harrison Ingram like moment over here right 1521 to go twopoint game here in Raleigh I have moderate to

Anniversary here in the coming month what a season for Norm Sloan and Company remember they beat Bill Waltons UCLA Bruins in the semifinals at the final four and then took down Marquette in the final arguably one of the best AC teams ever right coming into this game still from 1974 man I dont think folks are comparing the 2014 to the 74 team quite yet but the wolf pack can get to six and one today theres reason to mention that 74 Wolfpack Championship Squad tipped home by middle Brooks were tied again 41 AP piece were starting to kind of see the game turned towards NC State as far as that toughness and greediness thats kind of stuck with them to win these last few games were M with a nice offensive rebound tip in Couture sets up Collins hes feeling it now off the back bracket would not bounce in hit one got to get the next one up as a basketball player I respect it question is what will he do the next time hey look man hes now thats a great percentage and his last two last two horns pass deflected by padulla gets the middle BRS anyway banging with poti Middlebrook stays with it he wants it back Evan whats he thinking right now I think hes trying to go middle he might turn back oh middle fade away no morcel the rebound third chance and a foul on Baron good defense like we said earlier said before in the previous possession an State start to Bear Down on him a little bit on the glass and just trying to out tough him man to get this win excellent example of stick tutiven there by the wolf pack I love that word Evan stick tutiven dont know if you find in the dictionary but I know what that means he could say determined or resilient but lets make up some stick to that its an all encompassing word I like that just had our 12th lead change classic ACC basketball right here close to game down the stretch Road game for Virginia Tech that they kind of need a little bit and if they can get this one John you can see the road map they got their next three at home Boston College Georgia Tech and Duke another chance for morcel and more free throws coming Mike young just got to be pulling his hair out over there can we get a rebound I didnt necessarily see what happened but boxing out the shooter is fundamental when shooting a free throw and I dont think they did that on that possession they just assumed that maybe he would make it and now hes back at the line and now maai long has three fouls something else to monitor Morel back to the free throw Applause Music line the thing that stuck out uh stuck out after the game on two Tuesday Kevin Keith saying we are going to fight we are not going to get pushed around and they are battling on the glass again today full core pressure here horn against padulla our Taylors on the bench with three now coach young for Virginia Tech is very good at adjustments so well see what he does the second half to minimize the turnovers and get Virginia Tech hold it Applause offensively got some fun matchups out on the floor right now horing against padulla you got two veterans oconnell and Couture theres niichel morcel closed out but not quickly enough third three of the game for Tyler nichel hes their shooter their volume threepoint shooter every team needs one hes a guy for them hes hes been shooting it really well these last few games game high 12 points I saw a lot of him he was a Carolina guy a little bit hes good man to answer diara cant connect Couture the rebound crowd kind of let out a gr on that one I think coach Kei did as well hes now four for 18 from three on the season nearly it it is another turn over padulla lost his footing horn takes it makes it hes a guy you do not want him to see the ball go in cuz as you see his third three and a half hes not going to stop hes going to pour it on we got a new leading score for the day its DJ horn nine of his 13 here in the second half and Casey morcel lost his balance picked up his second foul nice defense by n state morcel with the throw aead pass to DJ horn in Rhythm cash thats how you play the game thats how inant State wants to play on transition the Virginia Tech keeps turning the ball over at this rate in state will run away with this game its got to be really hard for Mike young to look at the film and see these turnovers continue number 15 Applause today averaging over 14 a game in ACC play that number will go up no good for Couture diara Bear Hugs the Music rebound hun Couture hit the early three in the first half hasnt scored since this on the perimeter has been kind of their Achilles Hill Foria Tech were starting to see that take effect right now middle Brooks attacking potit padulla the other way nice fake getting in the lane hes just got to take his time down there fouled by diara diars got to stay straight up on there hes got to stay straight up on that hes got the athleticism his size second foul on diara takes us to a timeout 1153 to play free throws coming for tech on the other side next the action

indispensable for them down low yeah DJ Burns DJ horn both over 1700 points DJ Burns grabbed his 600th career rebound earlier today Couture goes one for two at the line its a twopoint game under 12 minutes to play deacons demolishing the Louisville Cardinals over in Winston Salem Miami and Syracuse are tight up at the Dome and we got a foul on the floor got with DJ burns down there you cannot you cannot get bored with making the right play hes got to attack the defense Virginia Tech is coming on his first move and and find the open guy I dont I think theyll live with that midrange jump shot every time from Burns first foul on padulla mconnell struggling to get it in flips it near midcourt Jaden Taylor back in the game hes been out the last 4 and A2 minutes shes got three fouls shes got to be aware of Applause that morcel to the corner diara attacking long Dr with the left hand comes up short good defense by m yeah hes given pooki some good minutes chessing up staying down you his thats how you teach it Evan nichel from the corner excellent contest for morel Taylor bulldozing his way to the basket and earning two free throws for NC State nice attack by by Taylor right here coming in shoulder off nice Euro KN where he is on the court by the way all all time double doubles in ACC history I think its Tim Duncan Ralph Samson Armando bot thats something you can take take home with right there your name up there through those great well padulla had the three straight career highs then ran into ree beatman on Wednesday ran into Jaden Taylor today hes ran into two supreme Defenders on a perimeter with length and size and athleticism and uh he struggled down the stretch against these guys Taylors been on him like right on Rice as we called ITC state by four feels like its the largest lead theyve had in a while Collins spinning through traffic and a whistle goes against Burns number three on DJ Burns Regina Tech you have to get a good shot on this possession this game kind of seems like the tide is turning cannot settle for a bad shot right now as NC State starting to take Applause control Collins back outside for padulla unable to find the range diara with his seventh rebound today more than anyone else in the ball game got to take his time to be ready for the double team and make the right play right Applause here Burns spins through the double this time but comes up short off the glass ahead for Collins to the basket and were back to a twopoint game nice skish one of the guards has to get back on that I think they might assume Burns was going to make that layup right there into the fourth quarter of this one here in Raleigh turnover number 13 for NC State padulla ties the game and one chance to retake the lead at the line capitalizing off turnovers has been almost of this game right here the one was almost thats a possession of BL where where diar has got to go try to block that maybe foul him dont let him get an easy shot we remain tied here in Raleigh NC State is one of the last eight no field goals for the pack in their last three and 12 minutes Taylor working on padulla shoots over him and its a late whistle and they call padulla on his second thats a nice aggressive play we talked about that not getting to the line I think that was an emphasis at halftime coach ke said we need to we need to be more aggressive and get to the free go line there was an interesting Dynamic there looked like Jaden Taylor was trying to Snoop on the Virginia Tech huddle he was just trying to get to the free throw line they huddled up right on the line he was just trying to get to spot well pack six of nine from the free throw Music line Taylor 77 for the season makes the back end do the sits down I dont think hell be over there long either uh played 28 minutes so far I guess hes got to get a rest somehow both teams have scored more points than they scored on this floor when they met 5 years ago in that Dreadful worst college basketball game of all time remember it well I was sitting in the seat for it much tighter much more exciting riveting back and forth today Couture step back three rebounded by Taylor oh tough pass for Music morcel good hedge from kid hope you can appreciate it at home folks these two teams are really battling right now we are battling its a physical game down there and a tie up kid

half for the Music hokes a renowned Rodeo family must come together to pick up the pieces after tragedy strikes catch the premiere of ride Monday January 22nd 87 Central only on the CW n State going small right now to see if that has an effect on the game with the at the Applause five Taylor makes a pair at the line back to a threepoint lead Hunter Couture has been quiet today but a crescendo there on the driving finish cant give anyone middle that was an easy finish for Hunter Couture whos trying to get into the game hes got six points so far NC States largest lead was six Virginia Techs largest lead with Applause seven diara leaping catch for Taylor shot clock at five Taylor unable to hit and Collins flies in for the rebound pookis looking to retake the lead padulla for three knew he would get it going eventually that was a nice drive shouldered him off created a space three wheres bill rafy when you need him that was an onion bucket right there for kadulla Applause Pooky back in front and another turnover for the wolf pack thats thats thats 14 turnovers 15 by 15 now by NC State yeah theyre going Toe to Toe the turnovers Tech hits why this game is so close the irony though is NC State has been one of the the top five teams in the country in terms of taking care of the ball oh Lefty finish how about that old school move from ly kid we were told they want him to be more aggressive hes doing that nice leftand finish his confidence is up right now they got to keep feeding him the ball OK hes back up four Parker scoop no battle for the board out of bounds officials look at each other and see State ball this is this is a crucial possession six minutes left 70 run over the last 90 seconds here meanwhile fourth rank North Carolina and Boston College getting ready to

correct that thats thats unacceptable at this late in the game this point of the game 15 for horn poti fouled morcel picks up his third foul trouble might be an issue here down the stretch for NC State its one of those games every play needs to be done with force and energy four different wol pack with three fouls Taylor Marcel Burns and diara and 554 to play well its an exciting weekend for

11 minutes wont go for Taylor rebound for Applause Baron W pack fans justifiably are starting to feel a little nervous cuz the Hoke he have the momentum and padulla is in form here in the second half he he he has found his way to the bass and I think this has to do with jayen Taylor potentially being in foul trop he cant be as aggressive on defense yeah we talked about that picked up his third foul with 16 minutes to go and padulla has heated up hokey by six here in Applause Music Raleigh Applause Music Applause Music I have moderate to severe Crohns disease now theres Sky rzy of myON means

Im running this kitchen make the switch its your business its your Verizon lets take a look at our key play brought to you by Hilton Hilton for the stay Sean Padulas first three of the game to put the on top padulla has kind of put the Tim on his back right here definitely hasnt coincide with Jaden Taylor getting a foul TR not being able to be as aggressive defensively and padulla is taking full advantage of that has his team up 6 points of 5 minutes left approaching an ACC Road wi theyre first this year yeah only the hokes and their Commonwealth Rivals at the University of Virginia theyre the two teams in the league that have not won an CCC Road game so far this year Notre Dame got one Louisville got one hokes 0 and four on the road overall will that change in the next five minutes here in Raleigh DJ Burns unable to flip it in but hell get two free throws see where the wolf pack want to go after the break I like what burns is doing he should get a little lower position but hes good out there he spins off nice finish gets the foul How would how would you try to defend him I would do what Virginia Techs doing come to him on the Move double team try to make him make a play hes too good of a passer to come right on the Music catch what about in terms of handling his bulk his girth as an opposing matchup Defender well potite is doing a good job of pushing him out on Perimeter but he also has a stay between him and the bat and that spinoff right there is why he was in a tough spot and uh ended up putting Burns Jor at The Line fourpoint Game under five minutes in the full court press is going to be a factor looks like BR Js on his way to his 20minute time what coach talked about oh padulla hangs in the air and lays it in what a finish got to figure out a way to stop him maybe they need to give Taylor a little help as he cannot be as aggressive but if youre Taylor its four minutes left you have to get a foul if you need one you cant keep giving up layups excellent double team from Baron Burns had a shoot over it the hokes have the ball in a sixpoint lead right now jayen Taylors got to be aggressive and defend him as he was earlier Couture catching shoot three largest lead of the day for Virginia Tech and these two guards thats what they can do to you put you out of a game real quick theyre playing really well down the stretch and another Wolfpack turnover each team now with 16 Music Applause giveaways its a season high for NC State and a timeout taken by Mike young with four minutes remaining take a deep breath everybody final four coming up on the

games trying to stay at top the ACC going against the most improved player in the league a year ago the Dutch sevenfooter Clinton post Boston College got a win over Notre Dame on Monday try to follow that up today with an upset over the Tar Heels here in Raleigh pokies have outed the wol pack 14 to4 over the last Almost 4 minutes this is a must stop possession right here but its a huge bucket for Hunter Couture on the road that right there is not what you needed if the guy hits a three to pession you got to make him do something different and state did not do that eight nothing run the last minute plus and a reaching foul is going to send NC State to the line for Two Shots its the 10th as the 19 foul just the 19 foul and they update that quickly on the big board here whistle had barely blown went from8 to nine the only way that uh n States going to get back in this game is getting to the line stopping the clock and scoring and getting stops one and one this is going to test their defense right now theyve got to get a couple stops string them together get to the line under three they need to get this game within strik distance get it under 10 with under three to go and theyll have a chance one for two for Music horn been a big difference in terms of ball Security in the first half versus the second half had 12 turnovers the hokes did in the first but just four since half time been a noticeable change as Collins to PO he goes down hard and the foul is the fourth on DJ Burns good thing good thing DJ Burns is not doing its moving whenever something comes to the B youed should go the opposite way Music Applause EV potit five of six from the line today six of seven your Virginia Tech right now the clock is your enemy you need to have good possessions run that clock down to under 10 and get a good shot and youll go home with the victory your first road victory in ACC play this year whos it off its off the Hokey says Robbie Baron and theyre signaling that theyre going to review it which I thought they could only do in the last two minutes so Tommy Morris he reminded Sean Hull of that and theyre not going to review it I do not see the green button that they have in the NBA games there no Green Light Special here Im sure they trickle that rule down to the NCA eventually its a good rule to have if we want to make games longer yes its a good rule to have I have nowhere to go you know its true oh conell and have passed it hes been quiet today offensively his second field goal there now this press right here they want to follow funnel Virginia Tech to the corner across half point and trap well see what happens here it comes and a reaching foul itll be one and one here for Hunter cout they worked on this a lot this trap a lot in this end of practice and its going to have to be something that works for them to come back in this game curious if they give that to oconnell or Taylor they gave it to Taylor and thats significant CU thats number four on Jaden Taylor its crunch time though Taylor cant worry about his fouls his team is down 10 points with 249 left he has to play the defense that he was playing Applause Music earlier Couture has been ice throughout his career missed a free throw today thats surprising cuz hes right around 90 for the season well he started off saying Couture and cabilla need to tighten up and now theyre both in double digits with 250 left and and stayed on The Fringe on the first half Couture and padulla had seven in the second half theyve combined for 20 and Robbie Baron just Unleashed a roar of Fury as NC State lost it out of bounds another stop for the hokei defense and time running out here for Kevin Kat and Company nice idea just couldnt get the pass around Baron hits his leg unfortunate break a break that they ill could afford Thea dribbles away from the pressure now hes got to go toward it up the sideline and back outside for Couture we have two veteran guards like this at the end of the game where you need to keep a lead Mike young has got to be pretty happy with where his teams at right now F middle Brooks I mean this could really be a huge turning point in the Hokey season when you look at the upcoming schedule you dont want to you know say oh BC at home you dont want to think oh thats a win Georgia Tech at home you dont want to think but those are two very winnable games for Mike Youngs team and if they could win those and then they got a little threegame winning streak with Duke coming to town theyve had some great moments against the Blue Devils in the past were sitting at two and four so if they get this win puts him at three and four it puts them in the middle of the pack with a chance to increase youve got to give Virginia Tech credit for coming in this hostile environment and and being up 13 with 2 minutes left I dont think I could have we would have ever expected this to be the score with two minutes left in this game on the road for Hur hit a game tying three at the end of regulation a few years back at Miami that game at the Hurricanes the next Road game for Virginia Tech after today as I said right off the top theyre two and four but they think theyre better than that and theyre showing you why today definitely showing why Viria Tech has to not let them shoot threes Marcel connects right on time I see but thats the only way Virginia Tech loses his Gams if if they let N State start making threepointers that cant be what they that happen they got 205 to go with an 11point deficit do you think Kevin Keats you know tries to trap tries to get a 10 count and then gives a foul here yeah youve got to try to trap and and if they get across half get a foul if youre Virginia Tech youve got to run time off the clock and take the best shot possible work get free throws every possession has to end with points if your Virginia Tech and time will eventually run out for NC State to score dont forget North Carolina and Boston College Tom wormy and Mike jinsky are standing by from Connie porum its its cold here but not as cold as it is in Chestnut Hill and theres not as much snow on the ground here as there is I might have to check that I dont know its 20° out there I dont know what its like in Boston you know how did you play in Milwaukee and not get accustomed to the cold you never get used to the cold Im a Florida guy thats why I stay down there now Im retired I dont leave Florida state lines unless I get called by the C what was the temperature in Tampa when you left about 70° nice oh the ball lost by padulla and diara gets it kicks it to the corner three wont go loose ball in the corner oconnell morcel the other side hes fouled shooting a three that is not what you want if your Virginia Tech actually worst case scenario fouling a threepoint shooter the clock is stopped and youre getting three points theyve got to be able to handle NC States pressure with these two guards coutur and pulla quick nugget for you John why has Virginia Tech created a double lead their last eight field goal attempts theyre eight for eight and that is the story of the game right now being up now 10 points and now Virginia Tech now shooting above 50 for the game going eight for eight his last 6 seven minute stretch has helped that considerably its hard to judge these ACC games man you never know whats going to Applause happen what makes it fun this what makes it the ACC as a player its probably what makes it stressful and we talked to Coach ke people talk down on AC a lot about the strength but he thinks that the strength is in numbers this is why teams struggle to win games on the road and you see games like this where a road team comes out with a nice Victory all right four pack with an eight can they handle the full court pressure get it across to Collins this where NC State wants to they call that a jump ball I cannot believe it that is but its won back they want you to get the ball they want you to have the ball across the corner those Corners they trap did he have him tied up here was it horn got a hand stuck in there or was Taylor got a hand stuck in there that is a jump ball right there okay he had him from my angle he had him wrapped around a lot of contact but he did have his hand on the ball how about this it was an 11point game steel three free throws if they get this to a fivepoint game right here oh settle for six settle for six two possession game now you just play good defense and let the tips fall where they make eerily similar to what Louisville did to NC State last week on a 14point lead with sliced to three late theres a reaching foul on horn hes the one who has fouls to give thats his first of the day about 3 minutes to go at the Yum Center last Saturday NC State was up Applause 14 and then the Cardinals cut it to three it was a 14point game here 7561 with about two minutes to play smooth for the Northwestern transferred Baron makes it a three possession game thats a big free throw we talked about how Couture sets the gamees played record for Virginia Tech 136 tying Malcolm delady Robbie Baron played 120 games at Northwestern todays the 138th game of his college career so atmospheres like this moments like this hes accustomed to him hes been in a few battles and keep bringing up Delaney I still have nightmares like I Applause Music said eightpoint game nice clutch thr those helps having a guy like bar with so good games under his belt Big Shot horn the morcel Corte uh Couture right in his grill to doua rebounds the Miss and he lost his footing he hit a wet spot are you kidding me morcel Corner three foul again oh good can you believe it EV this is this is not how you manage a 10point lead with 2 minutes left kadulla slips if if Im Virginia Tech I I would take that layup right there college was right there under the basket and then you just cant foul you cant do that Im a big component of you got to be aggressive towards the end of the game when you have a twoonone break they could have got a layup and sealed this game morcel made all three couple possessions ago how often do a guy get foul shooting a three twice in the same game let alone within a minute of each other Music Applause the bad news for the wolf pack is that Virginia Tech is one of the best free throw shooting teams in the country so theres not an obvious oh you should F foul this guy and MJ Collins 91 on the season Coutures 91 Padulas 81 Barons 83 n 80 they just y States got to try to get a turnover here and and then foul and they get across the fo fivepoint game its a tough spot I wonder what coach keiths does as he Fowler takes a possession trying to get the 10 count first oh great long pass ahead Baron to the basket for two got to be aggressive great pass but there that makes this game tough right now three possession game possession game no threes can allow a three oconnell rebounded by Baron and that barring anything too crazy should probably do it hokes 18 of 22 from the line today 82 very much in line with what theyve done over their first seven games this year crucial Road win for the h but FAU is a really good basketball team theyre a top 20 team so there a hoke team that has an opportunity to build a resume because they dont have that bad loss right now and this would be a really nice win classic a classic stay the course type of season they know what theyve been doing they told us that they think theyre better than the rankings and the stats say theyre showing it today against a 51 ACC NC State team thats number two tied in standings lets take a look at our Progressive player of the game brought to you by Progressive Insurance save when you bundle Auto home and motorcycle insurance visit progressivecom eight for eight down the stretch that is the story of the game they hit eight shots in a row tore with the three back to back threes which really put them up and kind of sealed the game for this maor Tech Team also Lin keing by the way hes had a good game tonight uh he struggled as of late they needed that from him and and hes part of the reason why theyre about to secure this Music Victory you look at the box score after this and say Virginia Tech has 19 turnovers and they still score 81 points well theyre shooting 53 from the floor theyve made 47 of their threes doubt theyre going to make another three but theyve had double digit threes nine times this year they got nine threes right now anytime you uh shoot over 45 from three most games you either win or youre in NC state entered today 50 in ACC play when out rebounding their opponent they got the edge and rebounds today but barring a miracle in these next at Virginia at Syracuse foul given with 261 left whats your key to the game for the Tar Heels today up in Chestnut Hill dont get bored with playing good defense thats what theyre thats their col and CA this year theyre playing Championship level defense the offense will continue to click for them but defense is whats been one of them games thats well said Mohamad diara just picked up his fifth foul so his day is done six points eight rebounds and 21 minutes for Big Mo the Junior from Music Applause France gutty win for Virginia Tech if they can close it out they fell behind six nothing off the top Music Applause wow I love how this crowd is still in the game and this is well right now theyre pursuing free chicken yeah thats that is that is that the key to the game right here free chicken there it is no free chicken I thought that was going Applause off he doesnt miss two in a row the V take bites cheering they didnt want to be a free chicken Applause 23 two free throws coming here for NC State with 192 seconds to Music go 14 points today for Jaden Taylor more importantly I mean that foul trouble really really had to you know open up the floor for padulla man uh cant state that enough change the game change the game man two possession game 19 seconds left into padulla not sure they have the time to go for the 10 count anymore but they get a deflection and a loose ball and C States got it Taylor with 10 runs over padulla offensive foul and Hunter Couture shaking up slow to get up behind the play thats tough right there you got to I think Taylor you got to go for the threepointer there you got 10 seconds Applause left no timeouts Taylor Just fouled out not sure he realizes it yet a little banged up hopefully doesnt linger man they need him down the stretch especially with these games coming up hoks trying to get this thing to the Finish Line coutur is going to get a chance to add add to his point total already in double figures for the 15th time this year what a career hes had I mean he thought he was going to wford committed to play there for Mike young and then Coach young called and said Im taking the Virginia Tech job I want you to come with me and he did not reopen his Recruitment and look for other schools he said I want to go with Coach young and he followed him to blackburg and he has been a Cornerstone of this program ever since can you imagine Hunter Couture in the Southern Conference I mean look how he looks in the ACC I mean itd probably be scary when he do down Applause there well they recruited some ACC players to offord during coach Youngs time there hes the reason why hes where hes at man hes one of the best in the Music business final seconds Baron gets a piece of it oconnell puts it in with 610 to go but the hokes get off the schneide on the road its the first win away from Castle this year for Virginia Tech obviously not
