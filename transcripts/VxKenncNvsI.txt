of freshmen theyre very excited about one of them Michael noo whos checked in early here for nor cadir and now kesan George will come to the scorers table and hell check in momentarily for the Hurricanes an early 86 lead for Miami Joseph with a basketball dribble hand off for Cleveland High screen from noo undertown the shot clock you notice not giving pack any space for any threepoint

a good look at Nigel the fourth year Junior earned preseason second Team all AC honores he was the Midwest Regions most outstanding player in the NCAA tournament last year high screen from noo Matthew Cleveland in the paint off balance floater is good its a great attack by Matthew clevel we want to see more of that from him in that power forward position but he can be so Dynamic he play the guard from the wing and we want to see a lot more paint touches by Mii Coast to co Darius Johnson the junior guard out of Maryland he scored 15 points in the opener hes on the stat sheet this UCF team is definitely on Attack Mode what you want to see you want to see early you want to attack the basket you want to attack the defense look a po three the face popular is popping them early ladies and gentlemen coach Lara thinks he has the best midrange Jumper in all of college basketball he is also lethal from Beyond the yard so Miami leads 13 to8 theyre working on toppler down low Kean George nearly forced the turnover ball goes down low for ibraim Dio the bucket is good Miamis going to have to fight this height of UCF all night long great test great test from for Miami its a great Music test heres George the Freshman he pulls up shot no good and itll be Miami basketball theyre going to say thats off of IAH Dio heres that popular three again hes shooting the ball with so much confidence and every time he shoots the ball he keeps looking at the UCF pinch letting them know Im here and Im him hes not scared with the ball in his hands he loves the shoot and he loves the score heres Cleveland thought about a three in the paint spins in the corner threw it away and he gets it back Matthew have to shoot that first shot George with a shot fake heres Cleveland 4 three thats good scoring H from Beyond the yard you want toble to shoot the basketball rhym and thats what he did on that shot caught the ball release it high release Miami four of five from Beyond the AR UCF is 0 for one all of their damage coming with inside about 10 to 15t early for the knights Johnson top of the key working on Bensley Joseph gets trapped in the paint they get it out shot up no good a bit too strong another offensive rebound though Im sure at halftime with the next time out coach H is going to talk about these offensive rebound opportunities that UCF is get and the reason theyre getting these offensive rebounds is because theyre attacking the basket the defense is out of sort they dont know theyre helping theyre finishing so youre going to see a lot of opportunities for offensive rebounds but my he has to get those loose balls and those offensive rebounds UCF has four early offensive rebounds theyve got four Second Chance points as a trio of hurricanes checked back in now for Jim Lena or Chad oir back in along with Nigel pack AJ Casey checks in for the first time tonight theres a massive height discrepancy on the floor AJ Casey able to swipe it away theres a foul on the floor thosa the more forward out of Guinea was working on AJ Casey and Casey just muscled the ball right out of his hands great defense by AJ comes right in the game because your defense is stopping and steal thats what you want to see from your one of your guys coming off the bench Casey a sophomore out of Illinois scored a career high eight points on Monday so Miami basketball leading by six about 12 and 1 half left the play omir back in those highlighter yellow shoes on here tonight heres George wide open AJ Casey pulls up for three way too strong I like AJ Casey taking that shot getting the early getting the early Jitters out expect more from him expect some shots being knocked down for AJ Casey mosus matus checks in now for UCF and right behind him Neil mahovsky will check in and hell substitute in for Darius Johnson couple of quick changes for Johnny Dawkins and he might get regulars back in there in about 33 seconds when we go to the next TV Applause Music timeout 10 newcomers played for UCF on Monday Theres a takeaway wide open onir H to their feet here at the W Timeout on the floor Johnny Dawkins has seen enough Byam he leads 181 first time out for Johnny Dawkins in ed CF a takeaway George to omir get up there big fella f one here at Miami 95 to 89 back in 2021 the last four games have been decided by 5 and a half points so we would certainly expect these two instate Rivals would have themselves a nice healthy battle inside the watso center here tonight Dawkins called the timeout after the turnover by UCF going into that TV time out Miami leading 18 to 10 oh a jump shot good look at that little hook shot there by ibima Dio he has a great touch around the basket very very good touch by the big fella its going to be a great test for NORAD I think NORAD needs to attack him from the perimeter on on offense just like hes attacking him down low on offense I dont think Christian Watson was looking for that pass from North chattel Mir tried to slip it through down low to the hoop momy has to limit these turnovers well theyve now turned over five times UCF forced 24 turnovers they had 16 Steals on Monday against FIU if you watch UCF on defense they use a lot of active hands hands in the passing lanes and theyre a super long team good shot no good Kean George with the rebound Miami in transition near travel they going to get him for it yes indeed George Travis its a tough call thought he kept his pivot foot there I didnt see that other foot get down heres another look at you tell me did he travel right here oh I dont think so Jack I dont know I think I think that the fact that he bobbled a little bit and kind of looked like he kind of traveled more made the to make that call yeah I think optically it looked like he walked Im not sure he did so 18 to 12 Miami another turnover for the Hurricanes boy the big fell down L shot no good here come the KES three on two in transition Nigel pack all the way to the r scores will go to the free throw line great Pace by Nigel on that fast break you notice he look to his left look to his right and no one sto the ball somebody has to stop the ball you look at that last play nobody on UC has stopped the ball great finish great play by n he stays so composed a lot of young guards they get going way too quick off balance contested shot hes so in control when hes got the basketball in his hands oh yeah for sure hes a season betet its not his first rodeo as you can see on that last layup patience is key especially at the point guard position P to the free throw line looking to convert the unconventional threepoint opportunity Miami leading 202 and he rattles it in Shooters touch for Nigel pack Miami buying nine 1050 left to play in the first half Nigel needed that basket I I I I believe next time down the flooor were going to see a Nigel pack three if hes open hes let letting it fly as a score you all you need to do is see the ball go in turnaround jumper good for sers great move by sellers continue to attack and thats what you want to do attack the defense put pressure on the defense he was great in the MidAtlantic Conference last season all ma third team last year shot 45 from three averaged 13 12 points a game omir for three straight away no good off the left side of the iron o nor was a little bit hesitant on that shot look at the ball spinning around his hand a little bit too much I think he needs to step in and shoot that shot with confidence Christian Watson called for a foul hes not happy hell take a seat Bensley Joseph wiga popper and Matthew Cleveland check back in for Miami thats the starting five that started this one here tonight there no Sila in for UCF along with Johnson Langford sers and Payne theres Johnson after an extended break on the bench thought about it for boy hes really quick with the basketball in the paint spins on Bensley Joseph he might have got a piece of the basketball popler Off the Bench for three buries it hes on fire popler is popping him shooting the ball with so much confidence he works on that transition three a lot in practice now a three on the other end no good for the Knight pop three of three from Deep hes got another got to get him another one got to get him another one wow great take heres a look at that last three and now UCF is so concerned he just pretended to pull up from inside the Green in the U he got the his Defender right off of his feet and he was thinking about throwing that one down and hes going to head to the free freee throw line for a couple of freebies here great decision by wer comes down makes a big three obviously now the defense is looking for that three pump fake drops to the bask get foul two free throws well hes got 10 points now AJ Casey checks in for nor Chad oir W Papa has almost has a point a minute son is that good its great yeah I think so if he finishes this one with 40 plus I think hell have a good night its looking I wouldnt be surprised he had a career high 21 on Monday against NJIT Johnson all the way to the rack with the left hand crazy shot theres a battle and a loose ball on the floor Miamis going to come up with it kanes by 12 Here Comes Nigel pack and he got it Stripped Away Now numbers for UCF the other way Sila on the wing hes looking for help oh he just threw it Applause away when youre trying to come back you have to limit turnovers especially unforced turnovers tough pass by the big fell right there now Shamari Allen the fifth year guard out of North Carolina he led the team in assistant steals in the opener hell check back in Sila will take a seat Allens a transfer from UMKC University of Missourian Kansas City the Rus pack from the elbow left hand up and good great move by Niger used to coming in and seeing Niger shoot long threepointers hes getting in the paint showing that he can finish the ball at the basket as well hes got such a crappy way of finding just a little bit of space for an undersized guard he can get to the rack heres a spin move on AJ Casey byar pay its a great move you know Mii went small Coach Johnny Dawkins thats lets take it aside to the big fellow great drop step great left hand finish pays an interesting story Jack he started his career at Florida transferred to Illinois transferred to Jacksonville where he was last season and now hes in Orlando this year Matthew Cleveland will pull up for three thats no good good look great look for Cleveland Look for UCF to go back down inside again on this play pain wide open down low but Miami

is up and good hes got such a beautiful touch great touch for Im sure he know going into this game the Scout report was do not give Nigel any open look and now hes taking advantage of them pressing up and hes getting to the basket for easy layups great touch on that float right there kans lead 30 16 wide open far side corner three rattles in and out an offensive rebound for the big guy Jaylen sers K is a very big strong guard look for more offensive rebounds for him this game one of the Ten Commandments the Miami Hurricanes and Coach lived by is rebound The Rock pass down low off the fingertips of AJ Casey Miami leads 30 to 18 early wga popper perfect from the floor perfect from the free throw line back with a near 60 in the first half tonight wga popler has been perfect and hes a big reason why theyve had so much success offensively early Jack if youre UCF you got to get up in wgas stuff youre giving him too much room too much comfortability for him shooting the basketball when you get one going as a shooter youre going to let that thing fly thats what Ws doing and he is not touching the rim theres nothing but the bottom of the net three for three from the field and a quick whistle on the floor I think theyre going to get popler with the hole poer with his first foul and the teams third but look a popler three of three from the field all three shots good from Beyond the AR a

your bench you look at your head coach Johnny Doug K we got some over here that can lead the way for us Cleveland goes one of two from the free throw line the canes have not scored from the field at about 5 minutes and theyve got themselves a ninepoint lead if you notice the big fell he catching the ball too far off the block so you understand that Norad is doing his work early hes making the big fer catch the ball off the Block its a tough shot for him instead of getting the ball down low hes catching it too far off the block big F needs to do his work early but great job on Norad on defense and forcing him out omir and Dio were exchanged in conversation as Miami brought the basketball up the floor 15 on the shot clock 245 on the game clock heres Christian Watson ball is loose and thats a turnover well team A little sloppy here early tonight Miami with six turnovers they have forced eight problem for UCF they dont have a single point off of a Miami turnover tonight even though theyve

free throw line Miamis lead is 11 130 left to play in the half KES are one with her last seven from the field the Joseph 3 broke the drought Joseph is going to fire another three up Christian Watson comes down with a rebound and they going to say thats off of Watson yes they are and its UCF basketball that shot by Joseph was altered little bit altered a little bit of a jab step to the shot I want to see Beno more catching shoots and not second guess in the shot now hes going to get all up in Darius Johnson clel leaves his feet here comes a three and that is blocked under a minute left to play now I like this kanes on them but they can switch everything one through five you have shooting all around the perimeter Watson for three shot for Watson boy he turns around he Stars down Samari Allen the lead is 14 if Watson makes shots like that expect to see him on the floor a lot more this season theres another turnover Bensley Joseph hes going to take take it himself and he lays it in Great

yes please with 247 emergency roadside service its easy to Geo oh can we get a box of course back with you in Coral Gables heres the Matthew Cleveland block on that threepoint attempt and then Nigel pack down low in the paint finds a wide open Christian Watson Nigel pack is an underrated passer I know we see him shooting a lot of threepoint shots but hes a very underrated passer makes the right decisions it puts the passes on the money that hit Christian Watson right in the hands and for me shades of a guy from a decade ago Shane Lin under side point guard terrific passer could shoot the three great Pace very similar players yeah he can really start and go with a basketball UCF is going to take the final shot here in the first half Johnson dribbling in towards the paint puts it up and hes got a bucket two take thats going to bring us to the end of the first half in Coral Gables tonight hurricanes opening things up early your early Impressions here Jack Im loving the play here Jack you know 10 newcomers for UCF once they start to gel a little bit and they build some more chemistry I dont know if thats a team thats dead last in the Big 12 but well have to wait and see yeah I dont see it either and one of their top players is out with the injury so good to see a different UCF team in the second half starting the second half Bensley Joseph forces a turnover with the right hand off the glass and off the right side of the rim no good thats what you dont you dont want to see a turnover by first play here Comes Allen and he gets blocked the follow up right there for Jaylen sers oh that was quick Pace great Pace thats thats what happens when you attack the basket you give yourself opportunities for offensive rebounds UCF turns the Miss by Joseph into a make offensive rebound and the layup on the other end theres a foul on the floor popper got foul first foul of the half on UCF Po got pop on that one didnt he yeah Darius Johnsons going to get called for the foul theres another look at it no it wasnt John thats going to be on sers thats not Johnson its on Jaylen cellers well thats good you want to put a body on W you dont want him to be comfortable in the second half Nigel pack gets a high screen they leave him a little bit of daylight he missed nor Chad oir gets foul Packs going to want that one back when he gets that much breathing room hes usually money pack definitely wants that back nobody for UCF in double figures in the first half Jaylen sers had seven in the first half hes got a couple of here to start the second half Miami leading by 12 nearly a minute into player down low for Matthew Cleveland he gets fouled hell go to the free throw line great play little stagger screen for Poler coming off big help went down to Matthew Cleveland I want to see these guys go right up a lot of hang time hanging in the air you got to go straight lay the ball up lot of double pumping thats three quick fouls on UCF here 50 seconds into the half as Cleveland makes the front end of his two freebies play a lot more aggressive this half sometimes you play to aggressive sometimes you get overly aggressive Cleveland makes a pair hes got eight points had a double double on Monday with 16 and 10 Bley again with another Ste another takeaway pack with a pump fake top of the key working down low nearly had it taken away theyre all over him no foul no whistle great active Hands by UCF got the capitalize on this turnover thats what they didnt do a great job of in the first half they have not yet tonight sellers for three no good thats going to be a push off on Shamari Allen thats going to be four fouls on UCF a minute and 19 seconds into the second half theyre going to be in a lot of trouble Miamis a good free throw shooting team not lying but I like this I like the aggression of by UCF right now got to limit the fouls though Neils mahovsky checks in for UCF he had a couple of Threes in the first half and now ibima Dio checks in as well right behind him fifth year 7 foot forward 250 lb start of this career at Ohio State transferred from San Jose State last season to to UCF this year Well UCF just got Joseph in the chin that was Johnson who just clocked him in the chin no call Miamis coming and running some professional floppy action right now a screen for wga poppler he had it taken away here comes Johnson with a Stutter Step hes working on Joseph and he misses the layup and theres going to fou going to be a foul and I think theyre going to get nor Chad oir and they are with a hold Im liking these sets that coach Lara is running on offense very Pro Set I wouldnt say its uh its not not all that sloppy weve got some misses here in the second half very aggressive though back back and forth it feels like the tempos picked up a little bit for sure its definitely picked up Miami is matching the energy from Applause UCF both sides have scored just a pair of points only nearly two minutes here to start the second half you see how nor Chad is doing his work early not letting that guy get good position down low theres a takea Away by nor Chad oir well they wanted to get the ball down low to Dio nor Chad is doing his job early hes not waiting for him to catch the play defense do your work early Matthew Cleveland wide open for three no good its short offensive rebound for nor Chad how about that Silky Smooth Move left side of the Euro to the left hand leg great move by n Timeout on the flooor Johnny Dawkins is going to take his third thatll send us to a TV timeout a Silky Smooth Move offensive rebound a leftand finish for nor cadir kans lead by six take a look at the preseason watch lists for the Miami Hurricanes nor shadir on that Carl Malone award watch list with a power forwards Nigel pack on The Bob Koozie award watch list and the Julius Irving award watch list Matthew Cleveland finds himself on there the canes are loaded once again trying to make another run to the final four out of the timeout here come the T kanes in transition Matthew Cleveland cant hold on to it or wasnt able to hang on to the basketball but he was fouled thats a h huge Advantage when your big fellow can get the rebound and initiate the transition yeah cool thats a thats a Ticky tack foul there Jack he might got got saved by that one yeah I thought he just kind of lost the ball and it was going to be a turnover Miami trying to get out in transition and uh the official down low having a conversation and now one of the referees is coming over to the clock to make sure the clock is good and uh think we got that sort of out that was Clarence Armstrong that just halt the things momentarily so 1725 left to go Miami leading by 16 they inbound the ball to nor Chad omir who goes up strong he misses the shot was too strong from the left side great High Hands by big pH both teams one to five from the field to start the second half about three minutes in UCF has got to get going or this ones on the verge of getting out of control thats a nice shot there for Darius Johnson thats a big shot thats a really big shot UCF needed that shot I think now theyre uh going to pressure defensively a little full court pressure for Johnny Dawkin he knows hes got to get back into this thing and what theyve done to date really hasnt worked theyre chasing 14 you know I love this lineup with Nigel pack and bsy jop both of them can handle the ball Premier Ball handlers I dont see this press being an issue at all they break it cuz theyve got NORAD who can dribble they get it back to him and he gets fouled on his way up they going to give him the bucket yes wow another Euro Step finished this time with the contact and one boy they let the continuation go there o I dont know if I would have given him an n one there that was close it was close give it to him it was definitely close NORAD initiated the contact what you want to do want to make the defense feel you he is so darn strong as omir makes the free throw wow Miami now with their biggest lead of the night it sits at 17 looking to improve to two and0 on the year Johnson double team and he threw it away its great help defense great help defense by University M theyre very active theyre very very active on defense well defensively now theyre starting to suffocate UCF and you can tell its really starting to frustrate him it is you can you can see that right what do we have here well another issue with the clock theyve got to put or take three seconds off the shot clock so theyre going to put 27 seconds on the shot clock all sorted out couple of clock issues here in the last minute or two w POA has been pretty quiet in the second half yeah without a point in the second half look for them to run something to get him a shot Johnny Dawkins wanted the travel Bensley Joseph is n he just got called for 5 seconds you never want to pick your ball up right there I think some you might want to take a timeout right there look for beny to get it right back right now a turnover by UCF and a turnover by Miami the 5sec call on Bensley Joseph as omir Taps it away from Johnson he gets it right back and high ball pressure defensively Johnson in the paint working on Joseph and Johnson gets a bucket Johnsons getting a lot a lot of pay touches right now we got to eliminate that hes got eight points just Darius Johnson hes four of 10 from the field high screen from omir whos got the basketball they hand it off the wigg a popper hes got it free throw line and the shot a bit too strong he gets his own offensive rebound now the ball is loose its on the deck and UCF comes up with it in transition mahovsky over Far Side Johnson now in the corner for Langford good ball Movement by UCF thats block and a foul by Applause omir its going to be the third foul on nor chir and thats going to send us to a break Miami leads by 15 get another look at lets slow it down for a you be the referee jack you tell me if we got a foul here oh yeah store thats definitely a foul oh yep absolutely and omir saying I I dont know what he was upset about hes trying to sell he just ripped his left arm off Chad hes got to get his hands straight up you know its 15 minutes left in the ball game and now norads on the bench yeah and Michael Nook is going to check in that was 100 a foul I I like the uh the desire to argue it but about took his arm off so Dio goes to the free throw line coming out of the timeout he makes the first Miamis largest lead of the game 17 that came here in the second half its sitting at 14 see if Theo can convert a pair and he Canady misses the second UCF goes one of two from the free throw line where they are two for four tonight mining N9 of 10 from the free throw line big discrepancy there theres a foul thats our Miami in the bonus theyre going to the free throw line with 15 25 left the play in the game so Miami now needs to attack the basket put pressure on the defense so they can get these free Music throws nine of 10 from the free throw line is Miami tonight this is Bensley Josephs first trip there he struggled from the free throw line last season and he makes the front end of the one and one its always the most important get yourself at least a point you see the first one goes in makes the second one that much easier Bo Miami has only committed two fouls here in the second half as Joseph connects on a pair UCF is in a world of trouble with all this foul trouble with 15 minutes left to play in the game trailing by 16 Miamis defense has been suffocating tonight theyve only allowed the 34 points dribble Drive in the paint Langford almost had it taken away boy working on Joseph hes trying to find some daylight and Bley Joseph just swatted it away all of that he comes up empty in the turnover great defense by B Joseph very active hands Bo thatll frustrate the heck out of you pack gets a high screen PA on the shot clock popler skies for the pass gets into the lane he gets foul he almost made that and almost lost his footing still went up well he might get himself a charlie horse right there hes got knocked pretty good heres not look at it wow thats impressive to get to the rack and get fouled from where he was Tyler Hendricks is set to check in for UCF so popler couple of freebies up coming as he makes the first and HRI will check in now for the knights thats 51 to 34 popler now with 12 its good for a game high hes three of three from the free throw line hes got his first point the second half now hes got a pair Miamis lead 17 that ties a game Applause Music high full coure pressure defensively by The KES Darius Johnson brings it up the floor mahovsky in the paint spins Johnson wide open three on the way looks good he buried it you really need that shot they havt really shoot the basketball great from behind the AR great shot hopefully that boost the confidence very little rotation on that three ball that was good crosscourt pass by Matthew Cleveland to beny Joseph and now hes going to slow things down and dial up a play for Coach L ooh back door cut popper was open couldnt get it to him miss the back door the floater by kind of short on that one a little bit transition and opportunity for UCF and mahovsky finished the Freshman looks good great body control hes playing with confidence right Music now lead is 13 nearing 1330 left the play UCF has made four of their last five from the field kanes have not scored a field goal in the last three minutes and theres a turnover and a foul thats going to go on Matthew Cleveland its great look great look well its amazing to watch Miami offensively without nor Chad oir they they cant get a whole lot going offensively right now it goes to show how important NORAD is to this basketball team UCF is going to run right now yeah you see the scoring drought there for Miami pull up jumper and that rattles in and out a foul on the floor thats on Applause Miami finally seeing sellers attack the basket he did a lot of that in the first half hes been kind of Silent second half we want to see more of that from him TRS on Michael noo The Freshman out of Ontario he had nine points in his debut on Monday a fourstar recruit from Canada they get into Dio two big boys are going to go toe to toe the red shirt freshman hris they missed the big fell again yeah now Johnson in the paint spins on Joseph creates a little space the shot no good wga poppler Soares for the rebound he gets fouled with 1259 to go Ws athleticism is out of this world I mean hes such a pure shooter his athleticism I dont know too many guys are in the country as athletic as we nor chadow is going to check back in for Miami with those three fouls we havent seen much from pay in the second half Music either the foul was on Jaylen sers UCF with nine fouls here in the second half the lead is 13 and now Omar Payne will check back in for the knights thatll send ibraim a dialo to the Ben so popler back to the free throw line Miami leading by 13 and poer connects on the first there still a lot of basketball left 14 points isnt bad its just tough when theyre in the bonus so my needs to keep attacking the basket try to get the free thr R than no Sila checks in Jaylen sers is out 5339 Miami leading little run here though for UCF and if it wasnt for all the fouls theyd really have an opportunity Miamis not scored in 3 minutes and 58 seconds of basketball but theyre just steadily making shots from the free throw line where theyve been fantastic tonight 14 of 15 great shooting 14 of 15 you cannot beat that they work on their free throws you can see their percentage is going up a lot this year no theyre free for a reason right free UCF has only attempted four three free throws tonight theyre two of four from the charity strike lead back to Applause 15 Joseph almost took that away from Johnson who pulls up in a midrange jumper from about 10 ft its good great shot anytime he gets in that paint hes making that shot more times than not that starting five back on the floor now for Miami omir connects on a pass to pack and he sends it back out near half court for Bensley Joseph little horns action by University of Miami omir in the paint spinning and hes fouled Omar Payne fouled him I think Omar Payne need to keep both his hands in the air kind of swipe down swide the ball ref right in front of you hes going to call that yeah you cant lean over like that even though hes stationary hes getting his hands over top of him got to stay straight up and omir a little bit out of control there right but he bailed them out as NORAD makes the first free throw once you start leaning over if you go straight up theyre not going to call it but as soon as you start leaning over him is where youre going to find yourself in a bind every single time and the ref is right in front of you as well so hes not going to miss that call now ibraim aalo is going to check in for Omar pay that was a quick trip out there on the floor for Applause Music pain oms got three personal fouls for Miami UCF would have an opportunity to make a run if maybe they could get him to commit his fourth Theo wants the ball down low hes now hes going to set a high screen for mahovsky theyre trying to get the ball to Dio down low but theyre having a heck of a time and now Bley Joseph takes it away unbelievable he is incredible defensively look a popler a stutter step to the wreck and thats going to be a goal 10 wow bailed him out UCF cant make those bonehead mistakes it is amazing to watch that young man w a popler soar through the air Miami with a big lead its 17 well you dont want to be the leader in the clubhouse in one department and that would be fouls Omar ping unfortunately four points and four fouls hes an important piece for John doin you see Payne with four sers with three hris with three Allen with three UCF in all sorts of foul trouble here in the second half and Miamis got himself a 17point lead its the largest or ties the largest lead of the night for the kanes two no NOS foul trouble turnovers got to limit them right on time another turnover by UCF oh he got saved wanted popler wanted the foul call Poppers not happy he wanted the referee to call foul popler still very displeased Lets uh lets see I dont see nothing there but was immediately peeved that uh the foul was not assessed on UCF there its a good word PE yeah well its a substitution for a variety of other words that yeah m get us eliminated off the air rather early Jack just get started baby come on two games in you guys are gone and theres a foul on popper now thats a frustration foul by wga popper for sure a frustration foul but I like to see the aggressiv the aggressiveness from wug on defense I mean obviously we all know hes a fantastic scorer fantastic ball handler but you want to see him on the defensive end makes that jump in the NBA he still want he retroactively wants to stop the game and Coach L is doing the right thing hes going to take him out for just a minute or two hes so angry as he comes off the floor oh hes Applause angry he wont acknowledge a soul all right so UCF basketball 1120 left to play Miami leading by 17 spin move right hand hook shot great shot got to keep going inside but its if you look at it look how far out this guys catching the ball that just shows you the strength of NAD hes pushing these guys all the way off the block heres Kean George the Freshman for three no good hes had a couple of open looks tonight cant connect quite yet had to connected with his form was good every time he CH the ball look at the mismatch Dio down low heres Sila dribbling right hand shot no good battle for the basketball foul on the floor who they going to get and thats going to be on AJ casy and two opportunities from the free throw line kep it up for the knights you see theyre still in this game theyre hanging theyre hanging by thread yeah hanging on Tyler hris hes in foul trouble hell go to the free throw line where UCF is just two for four tonight make it three for five but thats a massive discrepancy at the free throw line tonight Jack uh Miami is done an incredible job from the charity right where theyre 17 of 18 UCF three for five make it four of six its a lot of free points a lot of free points its a game that is the game lets see how George takes his Music pressure great Pace o Nigel pack tried to behind the back pass the nor Shadow Mir and thats going to be a backourt violation so its a 13point game with 103 seven left to play Miami A little sloppy here you see still in this basketball game I still believe they need to go inside moreala its Nigel Packs fourth turnover of the night hes having a quiet night just seven points four turnovers Casey guarding Sila they get it down low for Dio working on omir heres a three Sila buries it its a 10point game I think coach might want to think about a timeout here as soon as they get it across the timeline and he does hes asking for it and theres a timeout by Miami just like that its a 10point game with 1005 left to play coach wants a 30se second timeout theyll take it well take it with them this might be a good finish

seconds Jack that goes from a 17point game right down to a 10point game with a whole heck of a lot of time left a lot of time left basketball is a game and runs when these guys from the bench get in the game they got to be ready to play heres omir working nearly had it taken away Balls on the deck and he just dribbled it out of Bounce thats a turnover boy hes having a load of trouble with ibraim a Dio down low he just cannot bully him I would like nor TR to step in and shoot that shot I mean hes made that shot previous game he needs to continue to be confident in his jump shot can UCF get this thing down to single digits seven second half turnovers by Miami Kanes lead was so big this place has been relatively quiet if Im UCF Im trying to get NAD in foul trouble right now Allen to the pain right hand shot no good Matthew Cleveland with a rebound numbers for Miami four on three George wide open three hell try again bar thats a big shot by The Freshman just missed it three in the opposite corner stepped into the next shot shadow of confidence knocked it down hes got that full head of hair and hes got a full head of confidence three Sila corner airball now its taken away from omir and theres a foul and nor chatt omir is going to the free throw Applause line heres the three very smooth shot like we said missed one in the corner opposite corner shot that one with confidence and that shows you how much confidence coach El gives his players foul was on Hendrick hes got four they got two guys with four fouls now and Omar Payne with Force coming back Applause Music in so omir goes to the free throw line Miami 17 of 18 from the free throw line tonight and omir rattles the first one in Sellers and pay check back in for UCF just as soon as they get it down to 10 omir makes this its right back to 15 I I would like UCF to go to go with the Twin Towers put pain in the allo of the game at the same time a Miss by omir just the second Miss by Miami from the free throw line tonight UCF moving the basketball quickly and Joseph almost took it away hisy Joseph always has his hands on the basketball its unbelievable on ball off ball and thats how you stay on the court didnt even score a basket hes doing an amazing job Applause Allen will take it out of bounds right in front of our position courts side and he throws it into the back cour for Darius Johnson its a 14point game under nine left to play UCF is just hanging around we a poer back in as s Skies any he hits we havent seen sellers attacking the basket in the second half great things are happening every time hes attacking the basket foul on Nigel pack and and one opportunity for sellers fresh in on the floor Off the Bench hes got to finish his breakfast to make this free Applause throw sellers with 12 points tonight Johnsons got 13 those two are on the floor theyve combined for half of ucfs points Joseph Up and Under with the right hand what a finish SP with Joseph what a play by business jump stop in the lane two feet right hand finish he has got a motor that just does not Applause stop Miami by 13 now sers working on pack and fouled again sers finishes another just said it sers needs to continue to attack the basket its a big guard he use his body and hes a lefty I got tight I little shove little shove right there though I felt like at some points tonight UCF has been a bit more physical than Miami for sure theyre trying to bul their way to the basket its working sellers to make it the 10point game again as mahovsky gets set to check back in and he does it connects back and forth we going away theyre not going away great fight and Brit by UCF so sers with 14 points and 10 rebounds hes got a double double omir the closest in that department for Miami with 12 and seven Bensley Joseph has it taken away from behind here comes Allen in transition mahovsky with a hand on it Allen back up top sellers with a ha check no good an offensive rebound for UCF theyre within eight nor Chad doesnt want to get another foul so hes keeping his hands out the play we have ourselves a ball game theres a foul Music Shar Shamari Allen gets called for the foul UCF is on a roll theyre within eight 753 left the play that for UCF they are in big time foul trouble but how about the points off the turnovers UCF with eight in the second half Miami still leading that department but UCF has really come alive as Bensley Joseph will go to the free throw line coming out of the media timeout Jack theyve definitely came alive although UCF has a lot of personal fouls its because theyre playing Super aggressive and thats what keeping him in this ball game so Bley Joseph to the free throw line theyll get two no matter what and he misses the first so Miami now 18 of 21 from the free throw line tonight Joseph two of three from the free throw line again he struggled there last year and he goes one of two so Miamis lead is nine with 75 53 left to play this is a good basketball game late Johnson to the basketball hands it off to mahovsky the freshmans look good for the knights Here Comes sers hes trying to take the game over if Im youf Im trying to attack nor right now to get him in fou TR and get him out this game heres Langford havent seen him play in a while popular on mahovsky mahovsky to the rim wow what a finish a little floater your Chad foul so you want to go at NORAD right now get you some opportunities ah tough foul just got called for a foul right on the back of NORAD box is four sers has four now theyve got three players with four fouls and theyre all very important super important two of them are on the floor in pain and sellers and so omir will go to the free throw line hes four for five from there tonight Applause sevenpoint game omir misses the first Too Short if you notice he didnt go over top the ball youre shooting the basketball you want to see those fingertips pointing directly to the ground and he makes a second Bo theres the foul trouble four players with four fouls sers Hendricks pay and Allen and sers has been really good for the night here in the second half Johnson felt about shooting a three hes going to work on Bensley Joseph who cuts him off on the Baseline heres a trap in a double team Miami trying to take it away and they do when they capitalize in transition Here Comes Nigel pack Furious towards the glass air offensive rebounding Applause a great great offensive rebound great finish sers pulls up Nails it I we like the sellers kid hes playing with so much confidence right now keeping his team in the ball game a turnover by Miami they broke the press and Joseph couldnt handle the pass from omir its an eightpoint Applause game start to feel that tension a little bit Miami had that 18point Advantage theyre kind of coasting the Gyms starting to get a little tense crowds starting to get into it 6860 6 and A2 to go sers is trying to take this thing over himself hes working on P in the paint here comes a three no Lanford thinks better hes got an easy look at The Rim sixpoint game theres a takeaway oh it was close Langford got his right arm on the basketball the inbounds pass from Joseph Miami needs to settle down a little bit just a little bit settle down theyre having trouble with the Press great SE my pain on that last basket the starting five on the floor for Miami the inbounds will go to nor Chad Applause omir into the hands now of Bensley Joseph brings it across half court between the legs now the crowds really going to get into it for the first time tonight Poppers been quiet in the second half omir to the wreck and he gets fouled thats on paint thats his fifth five for Ping great attack by NAD great attack and now ibraim dialo is going to have to check in for Cameron pay so thats five and thatll send NORAD omir back to the foul Applause line slightly putting his hands a little bit over he want to go straight up and down put those hands straight in the air so Mir back to the free throw line makes the first its a big shot by Music nor Miami trying to Stave off a late dramatic comeback the lead is back to eight big free big free throws by ly right there UCF four for their last four from the field keep an eye on sellers 24 he started to take this thing over hes got 17 points tonight 6270 Miami leading five and a half ticks left to play in Coral Gables tonight Johnson Working on Joseph merely taken away here comes lford he skies and he misses omir with a rebound great attack if Im Miami you got to attack the basket right now well good defense by Johnson on popler no carry popler out top omir who had a wide open three if he wanted it hes still standing there he thinking about shooting it and thats a double dribble he forgot he put the ball on the deck now hes asking the coaching staff I dribble and they said uh yeah you sure did boy hes worked on that shot have a little confidence in that threepoint shot there yeah hes not when hes shooting a shot today so a turnover heres mahovsky over for Johnson down low and the pass is taken away here comes Matthew Cleveland in transition working on the Freshman gets fouled shot is up no good that limit those turnovers UCF with all these turnovers UCF is still in the game only down eight with 5 minutes left to go in the game both sides with 16 turnovers its a lot of turn too many thats a bit of a sloppy game and to add on to that so UCF has committed 20 23 personal fouls in this game Miamis committed 14 as Cleveland makes the first the lead back to nine with 448 left to play What contributed to the big run for UCF what did you see that allowed them to get back into it Jack they play very very aggressive second half I feel like they picked up the defensive acticity and they have nothing to lose theyre playing physical overall they look a bigger team stronger team a little bit youre right Langford swings at mahovsky the Freshman thought about a three drives up with the right hand no good hir down with a rebound look at him look at him down low hes ferocious with the rebounding lead is at 10 nearing four minutes left to play weve got a good one here in Miami Joseph stops at the free throw line hands it back off to omir gets a high screen omir is he going to shoot a three hes going to take it right to the rack with the right hand and he misses it n Chad needs to shoot that shot he keeps taking it into the big fella he faded away from diala and now benley Joseph takes it away Bley Joseph with another steal better not leave w a popper wide open I would not leave him wide open cant forget about W popper tough defensive breakdown by UCF Johnny Dawkins is going to take his last time out of the game with three4 44 left to play UCF forgot about popper in the corner he cant hide boy hes scorching hot hes got a good one theyve got a good one hes got 17 and 10 tonight its his 53rd career double double and once he kind of Senses its go time and its time to put the team on my back he puts it into a different gear man this guys a double double machine and he plays with so much intensity its contagious when your big man is playing active and with so much intensity your team cant do anything else but to follow suit sers and Johnson was 17 and 13 for UCF mahovskys got 10 17 for omir 10 for Cleveland 13 for Joseph hes too shy of a career high poer five of six from the field hes got 20 points seller to the rack give him the bucket in a foul so is really using that offsh shoulder off arm to get that space in the lane I think coach L was particularly fonded with the call and o four fouls on wiga popper o jeez its just hard no basketball that call could go either way or just no call or just no call correct so sers now with 19 give him an even 20 UCF is still only down 10 points 3 minutes and 33 seconds left in this game still a lot of time so under 330 left to play its still a 10point game Bley Joseph with the handles they get it down low for orir working on Dio still working double team look at how strong he is that ball was tipped off the fingertips of Allen Joseph tracks it down he lets it roll out of bounds theres 5 seconds on the shot clock UCF wants the officials to review it but theyre not going to be able to with 311 left so five now down to four Here Comes pack with two can he take it all the way Coast to Coast whoa Coast to Coast how does that happen how do you let that happen UCF just fell asleep on that one too worried about the reverse call that brings this big Crow at the watsco center back to their feet Johnson Working on Joseph at the free throw line little hip check on popler with the four fouls back up top well Johnson not looking to shoot that three heres mahovsky he loves to fire away for three he hits it its a npoint game and now Cleveland with a turnover heres Johnson for three could be a sixpoint game he misses it omir with a rebound now nearly taken away by the knights Bensley Joseph trying to settle things down nor Chad Mir brings it across half court heres a corner three wga popler wga poer a new career high for wga popler five for five for three he hasnt missed a shot hes got 23 now a takeaway by Miami Here Comes Bensley Joseph in transition he makes it and no timeouts left for Johnny Dawkins and the Knights the lead is 14 with under two minutes left to play Kanes trying to put it on ice another near turnover Miami is going to take it away Dio is going to be assessed the foul and now Miami starting to feel it heres another look at that Wugga popler three hes five for five from threepoint land tonight I dont think any of his shots has touched the Rim either no sir you know what we call that whats that cash hes going to make a lot of it here in about a year or two it might be after this might want to get rid of that too youre going to make a lot of it after this year what I love to see from wga is how efficient he is hes got 23 points on the off five for five from three the official going to the monitor nor Chad omir I think told the officials to go to the Monitor and take a look at something that UCF did feels almost like omir has initiated the video review but Im not sure I have any idea what theyre looking at omir was saying maybe something after the whistle in the foul he said somebody swatted at him I dont know heres so the ball was loose on the floor Cleveland had his hands on it ball gets loose omir comes up with it oh and looks like omir whack whos he upset with I dont know maybe hes upset with himself oh he whacked him in the left side of the face I think he whacked him to first though I think that was reaction by Ned just a just each I had one those happened to me ACC Big 10 challenge against Ohio State I dont know if I saw anything there that felt intentional its a reaction you smack back omir was saying something else transpired so I dont know if we have anything after the fact or right before it what he seemed to be upset about but I think theyre looking to see if there was anything intentional there by NORAD omir but regardless its a 14point game with about minute and a half and change left to play Miami trying to put this thing on Ice only look we got is nor Chad hold off and whacked them yeah I dont know if thats the angle the refs looking at cuz if it is call might get reversed or something may happen with this play the nor looking over like oh man they might have caught me nor Chad pleading his case with Bensley Joseph and Nigel pack as if they can do anything about it wasnt me hes simply trying to explain himself look at Music him one of the referees just pointed towards this end of the floor I think UCF might be shooting free throws here they call technical foul if omir assessed the foul it would be his fourth taking a while to sort this thing out theyre looking to see if theres a double technical foul all right I think theyre going to shoot on both ends and then would shoot the free throws or whoever got fouled this is uh taking a while its putting a damper in the excitement coach is looking on hes none too pleased hes probably thinking about the 17 turnovers by his team Tonight Im Loving to Swagger with these coaches nowadays you know used to be you got the suit on everything is super clean yeah more comfortable coach El just checked his watch think you got be kidding me 907 all right here here heres another look were going to have a flagrant one its going to be a flagrant one I think its going to be on Music omir I think theyre going to have to come down here on the UCF side and shoot those first and then yeah okay so a flagrant on omir theyre going to shoot on the UCF side first and then because that happen first then theyll go back down to the Miami side and shoot the free throws glad starting to get this all sorted out though I was getting concerned there for a second so did NORAD go tell the Riff after the Applause Music Applause Music fact and just missed a pair from the free throw line and now the official score is trying to get the attention of the referee and what they want to know is if Allen was able to shoot those because he was not in the game Allen was not in the game but they allowed him to shoot the free throws which is okay referees have that cleared up and now Matthew Cleveland is going to shoot free throws this is a turned into quite the do Todo here in the final minute and a half Jack yeah its a lot going on right now and uh actually a whole lot of nothing going on as well right a whole lot of nothings going on a lot of something a lot of nothing coach Al the first time I seen coach El sit down huh all game yeah well check that and now hes yelling at the officials what is going on I dont know why its becoming so difficult to sort out there was a flak Ren and now Cleveland shooting so hes shooting two freebies and then what ucfs going to get the basketball then yeah thats why UCF was wondering why they couldnt get on the foul line cuz it does not matter its going to be a dead ball after the second shot cuz UCF is going to retain possession of the basketball so its 8468 with a minute and 36 seconds left to play we clear we can put this thing back in clear I think we can put it back in play mahovskys had a great night the Freshman yes heres a deep three on the way no good Bensley Joseph with the rebound and thats just about going to put this thing on Ice B Joseph looks very composed out there yeah well UCF made it interesting they had it down to seven here in the second half heres pack with a floater and a runner and its good package really show that his midrange inside the paint game has went to another level youre so used to him shooting deep threes threepoint shots 90 run for Miami theres a tip by Poler here comes omir the canes arent slowing down omir trying to go Coast to Coast with a right hand its a 20po game not its an 110 run for Miami and a 133 run heres a three no good offensive rebound they get it down low for Dio but this baby is just about over as Dio makes a bucket to end the 110 drought for UCF and that 110 run for Miami 25 on the shot clock down low for Cleveland Corner popper thought about a three he pulled it out hes going to pull up fade away oh he just missed came up short great elevation by Wi on that shot Miamis going to come away with a win here tonight as sers with a put back is good Miami is going to win this thing 8872 but boy UCF gave him a run for their money and made him sweat this one out in Coral Gables tonight Miami is going to improve to 2 and0 here at home in 20 to start the season as Jim Lona takes care of Johnny Dawkins his UCF Knights here in Coral Gable tonight Jack your your closing thoughts this are a little messy here tonight but Miami comes out with a win I mean at the end of the day I think the better team won this basketball game but you see after the Great
