Cameron Corin will jump it up for the Panthers against Gods love Wabet for Eastern Michigan And its the Eagles who get started cheering as week two of the college basketball season gets underway here from the Peterson Event Center Thanks for being with us on ACC Network Quick work for the Eagles Addison Patterson gets the first field goal of the night Now we mentioned no Brandon Cummings tonight for the Panthers Noyus Indritis takes his place in the pit starting five Now yeah I think Neuas is going to have to come out here and you know do what he does best and give the team a good boost Andrew Situs the transfer from Iowa State Gets the start without Cummings for the Panthers Andrew Situs had 13 in the season opener a week ago against Youngstown State They like what he can give this team in his first season as a Panther And a bank shot goes in for Carlos Hart And the Eagles off to the four nothing start Carlos Hart you know hes averaged 20 20 points at his other school so hes a scorer The Panthers are going to have to definitely be aware of him all game Hart coming in from the D2 level A lot of new contributors for this Eastern Michigan team that returns just 8 of the minutes played from last years group Panthers still looking for their first bucket Suia backing down the defender dishing to Corin on the weak side but the finish wasnt there Mentioned a lot of new faces for Eastern Michigan but it was number four Mohamed Hab who was a star for them in their first game of the season a week ago against Georgia State He had 15 points and 16 rebounds Nelly this guy is a force on the inside isnt he He really is a force You know hes the first freshman to tally that stat line of better since Chad Hogram in 2022 for Gonzaga Thats good company to be And Homegrren has gone on to have a decent career in the NBA And Omari Witherspoon gets the three for the Panthers to get them started Really big shot for the freshman You know its always good to see the ball go in early in the game Miscommunication there by the Panthers Good hustle Good rebound Good save by the Panthers here Now Miner getting the offense set up cheering Andrew Situs the drive Nice jab stamp in the finish Very good under under control playing off two feet Allowed him to get that easy shot there That was a nice take Gives the Panthers the 54 lead Two and a half minutes in here in the first half Buckets coming from Witherspoon and Incitis Wude hand off to Ellison who dishes out to Hab Thats a good pass Great feed down low to Hart Thats special to have that vision from a 69 forward Hes showing his versatility You know the comparison to Chad Hogram Its early but I see what they see Foul drawn there by Indra Situs 1657 mark of this first half Witherspoon working on Ellison Now tipped away Panthers trail 65 cheering Harts drive Well defended by Pit Theres numbers Theres numbers Miner in the corner Cant connect on the three And Hard is there Pretty quality look on a fast break there Ellison drives and holds at the free throw line Corin goes up and gets that one Good early drag screen in transition there Miner crosscourt Suipa hoist the three and hits Roman has definitely showed that he can knock down that threepoint shot Thats going to be a big big development for his game Panthers made 12 threepointers in the win Friday over Longwood Looking to establish that as a big part of their offense Didnt have quite as much of a threepoint threat in the opener against Youngstown State but really got them going especially in the second half of Friday nights win Threepoint attempt that time Strong from Patterson and Cam Corin is there off the glass again Miner off the screen from Corin Lobs it up to him Corin swarmed on the inside Turns around and floats it in That was really nice footwork there Good navigation of that ball screen by Polo Miner Great pass Great finish by Cam Corin Demarco Miner goes by the nickname Polo Nelly said sometimes he thinks thats his real name He would write on his school papers polo minor because he was so used to being called that cheering Its a really nice nickname Hes had it since childhood Now Panthers defending on the inside and Su Alipa gets the swipe away And Situs into Corin Good ball movement here in the half court for Pit And rebound fight for between Su Lipa and Wude And it will take us to our first media timeout Panthers with the fourpoint lead before we step aside Well in the era of the transfer portal in college basketball Nelly you go into each season not exactly sure what youre going to get but Stan Heath might have himself a star on the inside And Mohamed Hab Yeah he really might have himself a star there you know hes the first freshman to tally the stat line that he did against Georgia State since Chad Hobbram in 2022 Thats elite company man You know so like you said its a new change of thing but I think they might have something with this So youre saying its a good thing to be in the same sentence as Chad Holgren I think thats a pretty good thing you know I think so Stan Heath has had a long career in basketball in the GLeague at the college level He was on staff at Michigan State with Tomizo when they won the national championship 25 years ago tremendous career for him Also time as a head coach at South Florida Arkansas Kent State and really impressive year at Kent State in 0102 Only there for one season because then he immediately got the call from Arkansas to go be the head coach there It was interesting talking with Stan Heath today because he mentioned that GLeague experience He was the 2021 GLeague coach of the year Was the head coach of the Lakeland Magic from 2017 to 2021 And asked him about all the movement in todays era of college basketball How difficult is it to manage your roster on a yeartoyear basis when it changes so much and he actually said being the head coach of the G League as Miner gets the swipe away and the jam Demarco Miner big time play on the defensive side in the finish I didnt know you had that Polo Okay 6 feet tall but he can jump can he He definitely can I did not know he had that applause and cheering And talking to coach Cable earlier he talked a lot about DeMarcos minor defensive pres defensive presence And there you see it right there A nice steel breakaway Okay Polo gives the Panthers the 126 lead Started down four nothing Then it was 65 and now on a 70 scoring run Miner the feed to Corin Fled in 146 Panthers We talked about DeMarco earlier you know hes going to have to continue to be a great player for Pit and hes doing exactly that to start this game off Great pass there Well Nelly Hemo we talked to Jeff Cable at Shootaround today about DeMarco Miner and specifically the ability he has to do a little bit of everything right At 6 feet tall he can rebound he can pass he can score But coach Capable said Yeah I like that he could rebound but to me its the way he impacts winning wherever he goes Yeah you can tell in the way he plays you know he he can do a little bit of everything He we seen him last game make threes You see him this game facilitating the ball screen and and getting fast break dunks You know we didnt Coach Cable didnt tell us nothing about that but thats pretty impressive as well Jeff Cables new point guard putting all his new skills on display Cable has turned around this pit team It all started to happen in year five when a guy named Nelly Cummings brought him to the NCAA tournament Yes sir And you know I see a lot of our team and this team here They got to continue to show that they can score and win in different ways What about this team do you see thats similar to your group I think just the makeup you know I think that they have a lot of hungry guys who have been slighted before whove been overlooked and I think thats a recipe for a really hard playing tough together team 166 is the Panther lead here A foul called against Pit And you use the word overlooked and Jeff Cable has mentioned to us on multiple occasions how going into your season 22 23 he made a deliberate effort to get guys who appreciated the opportunity to wear the pit jersey and play college basketball Yeah I think thats a huge thing especially with the landscape of the game changing so much that you dont know what youre going to have year in and year out but if you can find guys who want to be there and want to be a part of it I think youll be in a good shape Panthers have hit their last three from the floor Leader is Witherspoon with five Indraitus The pull up wont go Miner hustling down to tip the ball to Dunning Dunning kicks out Indraitus wide open Bullseye Good shot Good pass by Barry Dunning there Good extra rebound Great extra pass Panthers on a 194 run since starting this game down four nothing Then a foul called against Dunning Barry Dunning Jr called Great extra pass here by Barry Dunning to get Noyas another look at it You know hes not going to miss two in a row Great shot Good feed from Dunning And Nelly you and I were chatting earlier He hasnt had the stats he maybe wants to so far this season but he can see the potential And if you look at the back half of Dunning season last year at South Alabama you can tell that this guy certainly has it Hes able to put up points and its just a matter of time before he puts that on display in this league Its definitely just a matter of time Any guy capable of having 46 in a college game they can score the basketball So just a matter of time Barry Dunning Jr averaged 22 points per game over the final 10 games of last season at South Alabama Heres Su Lipa working on Manel spinning in the lane and taking the strong take up off the window Thats a really nice move there You know Coach Cable was screaming to move the ball but when you have a guy who can go down the middle and do that sometimes you just let him do what he does Patterson nice take with the left hand Dunning drive tried the euro step into the defender and a foul called 2110 is the Panther lead Roman Suipa using his big body to get inside the paint and score But the Eagles trying to hang around here Addison Patterson with the answer Lead here The story through two games Nelly has been the struggles in the first half for Pit You see they get out to bigger leads in the second half but both Monday and Friday of last week took them some time Different story tonight Yeah for sure I mean theyre having a pretty explosive start to this game I hope they can maintain that because you know Eastern Michigan is a well coached team whos not going to go away easily And theyve been propelled by a couple of freshman Omari Witherspoon and Roman Sua with five apiece Those two are a combined four for five from the floor The Panthers as a team have hit five of their last six from the field and now on a 174 run in the early portion of this first half And Nelly even more impressive that theyre doing it without Brandon Cummings And in some ways it you know thrusts guys into bigger opportunities when you dont have one of your best players Yeah for sure Everybody has to step up and you know it allows some guys to play in their natural positions and everybody has to continue to do what theyre doing right now Lead grows to 13 for the Panthers Heres a drive from Rubio Cam Corin the strong rebound We talk about figuring things out with a new look roster Stan Heath has used 11 total players in this game for Eastern Michigan What a drive from Marius putting the ball skills on display and getting to the rim really nice take and like you were alluding to the new era of college basketball things change so much and you you expect it from the high majors but the fact that mid major teams are having to go through the same struggles is very telling of the situation were in Rubio looking for an option finds one outside this is Sanders seven to shoot for him spinning on Witherspoon traffic in the lane offensive board second chance wont go and Dunning hauls it in for pushes up Su Alipra Levitating on his way to the rim Thats a really nice pass there by Barry Dunn Im glad to see hes out there having fun 17point lead for the Panthers A newcomer music to newcomer on that last Thats a great connection there You know Roman has proven that hes an excellent cutter in transition and its great to see Barry Dunning out there having fun you know doing what he does and showing showcasing he has the great vision he does And again we talked about it with Jeff Cable earlier today with Barry Dunning Jr might only have two points but he has not attempted a field goal and hes impacting the game in so many other ways that can help get his confidence up as he moves into this new pit team Definitely I think you know just having a role on the team no matter what it is feeling like youre a part of something allows you to really be your full self Hab from the free throw line gets it to go Thats the second field goal on the night for him Hes got four points That was a really nice midrange shot there You can see that hes very skilled Injuritus setting up the offense Kick out to Dunning Step back Jay falls Good to see him get on the board there Lets see if he can continue You know hes capable of 46 So lets see if he can keep going You said 46 46 Great back half of the season last year for Dunning and hes cheering got four here early tonight Witherspoon gets called for the foul on Eagles drive and nice feed here from Indraitis Great feed and it looks to me as if theyre isolating the switch with Habh and theyre trying to attack in there So keep an eye out for that as well Impressive display specifically from the newcomers on this pit team tonight Nelly you think about the returners The two biggest guys coming back were Corin and Brandon Cummings So youre without Cummings tonight So really the only key returner that played heavy minutes last year is Cam Corin You have Papa Conte chipping in of course as well but it is forcing a lot of those new players to show what theyve got and theyre stepping up to the occasion They definitely are and they have to continue to do so because like we talked about earlier Stan Heaths a great coach and hes going to continue to make adjustments throughout this game Stan Heath said this is the best team hes had at Eastern Michigan in his fifth season coming off 16 wins last year the most since becoming the head coach in 2021 Corin tips it up Suipa jumps up and keeps the ball on this end Dunning backing down Hart spinning twisting and has it denied by Carlos Hart Offensive rebound and the stick back there for Patterson on the inside That was a nice veteran play of being where the ball is going to come to by Addison Patterson So the good put back there by Patterson number nine for the Eagles Madison Patterson is 25 years old and he was ruled eligible officially just one month prior to the start of the season Originally from Ontario and started his college career at Oregon back in 2019 So he is now in his seventh year of college basketball Now Justin I think I need to go out there and get in next year at this point Im 26 I got one more year Have you he tried to get that waiver yet I think Im going to try this year now that I know this story Im going to try after this game You tried to sneak out to shoot around on Friday and get some shots up I did I didnt think you seen that They all went in right Of course Under eight to go first half The Eagles trying to cut into a big Panther lead cheering but Pit has looked great on both sides of the floor Defensive play there will give them possession out of the timeout 2917 and Nelly this is clearly the best first half theyve put together this season Yeah it definitely is You know theyve come out strong and I think that the shooting numbers tell the story here Theyre making shots and everything is going pretty good So they got to continue to do so And interesting too despite how well they shot the threepoint ball last game Friday you still see that total percentage in the first two games at 26 So really starting to get that shot going in the second half of Fridays game and carrying it into tonight Three for seven from the perimeter Now heres Kin with six to shoot Backing down Wabude using his strength on the interior and getting the finish Thats a really nice move by Cam Corin there just showing his versatility as a big just not a dunker You know he has moves too Mari Moore checked in 21 for the Panthers shortly before the timeout Now heres Habh working on Corin Cant get the jumper to fall Habh two for six with four points to start the night Miner surveying crosscourt pass incitus Suipa ball fake drive and fouled on his way to the bucket It appears to me that every time theyre getting have in a situation that the Panthers looking to attack him Nelly what have you noticed as the biggest difference between Suite game one to tonight I think just his aggressiveness and knowing when to go and when not to go You know I think the first time he got a chance to look at him he was just going getting the ball and going And I think now hes really starting to find his pockets of when he can attack and when when to uh swing the ball and its allowed him to get to the line a lot more and be more productive overall Suipa had just four points a week ago against Youngstown State He was two for seven from the floor in 17 minutes played a lot better Friday against Longwood 12 points more efficient from the field and tonight putting together a very productive first half Nine points three of four shooting on the night Su Alipa leading all scorers late in the first half Hab back door cut powderene He beat more That was a nice cut Nice veteran play there The freshmans going to want that play back But great great cut by an older veteran guy Mentioned Su Lia the leader for the Panthers Its been Patterson the most productive for Eastern Michigan Hes got nine points in his first season as an Eagle here Back door Su Lia slam Great bounce pass by Noyas Another great play there by Roman Up to 11 Patterson tries to answer again but rejected by Moore Fast pace up to Indraitis Crosscourt Miner back to Moore off the window No finish Corin puts it right back up and in The Panthers are definitely enforcing their will here Showing what showing Eastern Michigan what a high major team looks like right now Faster pace than the Panthers have played with the first couple games too Yeah for sure And theyre turning their defense into offense Panthers have forced five Eastern Michigan turnovers Nelly how about Pit has only turned the ball over themselves one time tonight Thats huge You know we talked to coach Cable today and shoot around That was one of his keys to winning the game today to clean up their turnovers Theyve had 14 turnovers the last two games 14 plus turnovers the last two games Nice drop off Good job playing off two feet there by Neyas attracting the whole defense And talk about turning defense into offense Big play there from Moore whos taking advantage of the opportunity Did not play Friday but gets in and makes a little impact here in the first half Anditis runner wont go Dunning Suipa Now a fight for it on the floor One by Patterson Patterson working on Miner Kicks out Corner three Thats going to fall Patterson is playing really well Hes keeping him in this game right now The steals scoring assisting Hes doing everything right now for them 11 points for Patterson the senior leader for Eastern Michigan Second team all Southland conference last year at Northwestern State for Patterson Suipa Andrew Situs shot fake and drive Short pull up Gets the roll Hes doing a really good job playing off two feet when he gets to the paint right there You see thats time he chose to shoot but hes made great passes out of that same position Injuritus is up to nine points Transfer from Iowa State Abab thought about the three Andrew Situs defending Hart now Hart working on Corin goes baseline and somehow gets the angle to sneak it in Thats a really nice take there Thats a difficult layup there As you can see the Eastern Michigan is now into his own Marco Miner identifies it now Indraitis New defensive look thrown at the Panthers How will they answer Miner kicking out to Dunning Corin back to Miner on the cut Shot wont fall and almost got the takeaway back but it stays with the Eagles Patterson is running Dishes off Corner try from Manel He gets it to drop and the Eagles starting to get hot from downtown They cut the lead to 10 Patterson is continuing to show that hes a really good player out here Hes hes grabbing rebounds Hes getting assists Hes doing it all So just under three and a half to go in this first half How will the Panthers respond to the change defensively from the Eagles Corin turns it over and now its Ellison who draws contact from Indritis and thats going to be the second foul on Noyas Indraitis for the Panthers but the Eagles are not going away Theyve made their last four from the field Carlos Hart going baseline and Patterson on the kick out to the switch right away You could hear Jeff Cable talking to his team trying to get his team organized as they took on the zone of Eastern Michigan there Just switched to that Just been a couple possessions in the zone for the Eagles And so now Jeff Cables team up by 10 The last few minutes of this half going to be very important now to determine how this game will go Very important You know like we talked about earlier with coach Stan Heath Hes a great coach and coach are going to make adjustments throughout the game that both coaches are going to have to adjust to and players as well at the line there Mai Ellison goes one of two Now theyre in a fullcourt zone here One two two Great vision from Miner to find Conte on the low block who turns around and scores Be a nice take there Pop over that left shoulder Hart goes baseline on Corin Found the lane but tipped away Miner skies up to get it for Pit cheering Kick out Dunning Jr for three Wont go there Eastern Michigan not slowing down Ellison now will pull it out Doesnt have numbers And the Eagles reset outside triple Misses everything there from Manel Great vision there by Polo to find Papa Kante down there When he gets over that left shoulder you can forget about it Count it two points Demarco Miner connecting with Kante there And like we talked about Ellie Miner can just do so many different things Friday it was his threepoint ability that really was on display And tonight hes only taken three field goal attempts but he has three assists Hes impacting the game in other ways Yep Just like Jeff Cable spoke about earlier hes a winner And winners are going to find ways to be effective no matter what the environment is Another feed there from Miner to Dunning Dunnings drive too strong Gets his own rebound puts it back up and tipped away picked up by Ellison and a foul called I think thats going to be three on Noius Injuritis So some foul trouble in the Panther back court as Injitus picks up his third and it means Jeff Cable has to put in Omari Witherspoon who has two of his own fouls This is going to be an important finish these last minute and 50 seconds here to stay out of foul trouble and for Omari and still remain playing hard at the same time So productive night for Indraitis but now finds himself on the bench with those three fouls Heres Habh working on Conte Turnover picked up by the Panther big in transition Witherspoon Dunning fakes backing down Hab inside Kante Papa turns and scores Gets the roll off the back iron Once again when Papa Conte gets that ball over his left shoulder those are thats two points almost every time down there And a foul called It will go against Cam Corin his first on the other end Edwards will head to the line Its a good look here by Barry Dunning to find Papa where hes good at with a mismatch on him over his left shoulder You can forget about it Count two go the other way Panthers getting some nice early contributions from Kante Four points two of two from the floor has only played five minutes And you know youre seeing some signs from Papa Kee early this year that he has improved a lot over the off season Really rebounding well in the first couple of games and tonight looking very good especially with his footwork done on the low block 100 You know Ive Ive seen Papa play really well against Ohio State last year as well you know since that game you know he hasnt had a chance to showcase what he can do but now hes starting to showcase the old papa that everybody was accustomed to Of course hes been thrust into a big role this year Panthers found out they were not going to have Deshawn Jackson transfer from Iowa State was expected to start down low for them They will not have him out indefinitely for medical reasons And gets Papakante in a position where hes going to be needed on the inside for bit Important final minute of the half here with the Panthers up by 11 Nine on the timer here with Witherspoon working against that EMU zone Miner crossing up Ellison drives Runner gets it to drop Thats a really nice photo right there He shot that to the moon Really nice photo right there Demarco Miner with the penetration gets the shot to drop His Panthers are up by 13 39 seconds music left First down Panthers up by 13 Final minute here of the first half Look at the arc on this shot from Miner Nelly This was a very very high arcing floater there I think even though Habat wasnt down there he may have heard we talked about Ted Hogram today He shot the ball so that no one could block that one Thats right With Gods love Wabude trying to get in the way of it but unsuccessfully Impressive stuff from the veteran guard Demarco Miner has really impressed in his first few games with Pit Good defense here by the freshman Mari Moore as Carlos Hart brings it up 9second difference between shot and game clock here to end the first half Patterson fadeaway jumper wont go Rebound Miner Panthers can hold for the final shot of this first period Corin sets the screen Miner penetrates kicks to Moore Corner three wont go And that is how the first half will end But Nelli 45 points The Panther offense humming in that first period They definitely were You know thats a great half for the Pit Panthers If they can maintain this it would be great Most points in a Thats huge Like Coach Cable alluded to earlier in shootound If they can clean up their turnovers theyre a much better team as in every team in in college basketball So we begin the second half Thanks again for being with us Jason Earl and Nelly Cummings with you in this college basketball nonconference game in week two of the season And Panthers trying to get out to a 30 start this year after wins over Youngstown State and Longwood The Panthers are able to get the win Would be their third straight 3 and 0 start Panthers got out to a 60 start season ago Of course had an excellent start to last season got ranked as high as number 18 in the AP poll but struggled as the season progressed into ACC play and ended up finishing 17 and 15 Suipa off the inbound is denied Great defensive play by the Eagles Patterson the three Its a wedgie cheering That one was a little stuck in there wasnt it Does that count And count that as our first wedgie of the 2526 season at the pee Jump ball gives it to Pit Eagles started it with possession in the second half Eastern Michigan has picked up their pressure a little bit You can tell that was probably an emphasis in the locker room And Eagles now have gone back to the mantoman defense Lets see how long they can stay in it or if theyre going to if its just a switch up Hard off the screen from Wet slithering through the lane and yes a crafty finish indeed Thats not his first finish like that either So thats something that Eastern Michigans going to have to look to exploit and continue using And theyve trimmed that lead down to single digits 4536 as Carlos Hart off to a good start in the second half He has 12 on the night Pass inside Corin battling through the defense and Wabude comes up with it for Eastern Michigan Up ahead Habh down low Patterson denied by Corin Big time play defensively Eagles get it right back Heres Ellison Habh trying to create space Injuritus making it difficult Alioop off the mark but tipped once again out to Hart who drives baseline His floater wont go Another scramble for it Hart on the floor to get it Indraitus bending over to try and grab it and still a loose ball Indraitus flips it to Corin and Corin recovers it for Pit who has a threeonone Minor Su Lipa misses the jam Now Witherspoon spinning inside Another chance at it And Suipa is fouled to end quite the frenetic sequence That was a lot of energy out there A lot of effort on the floor there Thats good sign for both teams Both teams fighting and flowing Thats how you got to do it I mean this ball was loose for about 15 seconds It felt like its crazy cheering ended with the misjam from Su Lipa and ultimately does find his way to the foul line And Situs a guy putting the hustle on display Suifa goes 0 for two from the strike Coring the offensive board Witherspoon squares up the triple and hits Shot Great rebound and good kick out there Call those dagger threes right there Those are the most made shots in college basketball if you ask me Omari Willitherspoon having his best offensive night as a Panther Eight points on three of five shooting Baseline drive Habh draws a foul Looked like Corin Great rebound there by Cam Good kick Its the best shot in basketball right there Dagger threes Another efficient night for Pittsburgh from beyond the ark They are four for 10 from downtown here tonight Getting out to the 12point lead Still waiting to see if the Eagles big man Mohamed Habhab can become a bigger part of tonights game Mentioned hes coming off 15 points 16 rebounds a week ago against Georgia State different test tonight on the road against an ACC program in pit He does have six points but Stan Heath struggling to find more ways to get him involved offensively Thats going to be a big progression as this game goes on Can he do it or do other guys have to step up in his place to do it Lead is 10 for the Panthers Witherspoon crossover feed inside to Corin who saves it Baseline pass to Andraitis Eight on the timer Kick out Witherspoon Hes got the hot hand Spins on Patterson Two to shoot Miner catches nails the three and the foul I talked to coach Cable earlier in the shoot around He said he likes Polo Miner is shooting catch and shoot threes Thats a very tough shot there Heavily contested Come to space Catch and shoot Thats what he does Knock down Demarco Miner beating the shot clock buzzer there Nelly you and I were talking before the game This is a guy who shot 28 from three last season at Oregon State But those catch and shoot opportunities really working out for him so far this year making him a lethal threepoint threat Definitely And I think its it speaks volumes to who the coaching staff are to be able to recognize that hes much better when hes catching and shooting threes and doing whatever they can to get him in those situations Panthers wanted to travel Didnt get it with Habh Still forced him into a tricky shot and allows them to win possession Foul called against Carlos Hart of the Eagles The second against the Eastern Michigan senior Spoon setting up the offense here for Pit Nice roll from Corin Backing down Wude Wude thought he was straight up but he gets called for the foul Eastern Michigan trying to cause a little bit of confusion with their defense Theyre switching everything now up top Thats why that pass was able to get through there Eagles head coach Stan Heath doing everything he can to not let this one start to get away Panthers 14point lead The largest lead was 18 for Pit late in the first half Jeff Cables team trying to find ways to put this one out of reach Of course again if you just tuned in the Panthers are without Brandon Cummings tonight Hes out with a lower body injury They will not have him the entirety of this game Thats hard again Hes a really crafty finisher around the basket man Every time he gets down there good things are happening for the Eagles Little fullcourt pressure DeMarco Miner able to beat it Now Witherspoon drives dish to Corin Beautiful pass from the freshman to the veteran in the finish Great execution there in that ball screen by Mari Witherspoon A lot of these new Panthers starting to get more and more comfortable Omari Witherspoon is one of them A nice feed on the last bucket to Corin Witherspoon also nailing the triple and dishing a little bit too finding DeMarco Miner 5440 the pit lead fact that youve got guys coming from all over and not much returning from a season ago Very important that they stick together in this era And Nelly the college basketball season goes by quickly So you dont have much time to get everybody on the same page You dont have a lot of time And I think its a beauty for them that eight or nine of their guys are from the uh Michigan area So theyve actually had some history together whether its playing against each other or together I think that helps them a little bit in this new era of college basketball Stan Heath mentioned that a lot of guys like that ability to come home and get back to Michigan Said they are familiar with each other They may have gone to a lot of different colleges but because so many are from the state of Michigan they knew each other growing up either playing with each other in high school maybe against each other in high school And so while it may seem like youve got a mixed group of all different schools coming together to play here at Eastern they do have some background growing up in the Michigan area and being in the basketball circles there Eagles going to insert John Shenu the second here Well Shenu is one of the few returners for the Eagles Seeing if he can provide a spark here Just under 15 minutes to go Second half Drive from Green Wont go Rebound Corin is his sixth of the night Kante kicks out to Mr Ellie What do you think about the Panthers when they run Corin and Conte out in the same lineup I like it I think it provides us with something that was different than last year because rebounding was a big big problem for the Panthers last year I think when you have the two bigs there it addresses that huge problem which as long as you fix one problem you got to worry about the next one after its fixed Warren and Conte both at 610 providing some size for the Panthers Looks like the Eagles are back in that two3 zone Witherspoon going to dribble right through it Kick out Miner Shot fake Three to shoot Intercitis from the wing Wont go Rebound Ponte He was fouled trying to bring it in And it goes against Praying Green Thats what Papa can provide right there when you have those two bigs and youre going to get extra rebounds that you werent getting prior to this Panthers rebounding has certainly been one of the bright spots so far this year They have a plus 17 and a half average rebound margin through two games That is the best mark in the ACC in that category So really impressive stuff from Pin off the glass and a nice find from Miner to Conte on the baseline inbound and a foul called against the Eagles once again And that is already going to put the Panthers in the bonus Seventh team foul against Eastern When you have two bigs here like that crashing at the same time You see 33 got a little bit lost when Pop ran through there Thats different when you can play with two bigs there The Panthers are struggling from the free throw line this half They are Panthers one for six from the line this half Five for 12 on the night Papacante is 0 for three and thats what you call Nelly the reverse commentator James right there Thats the reverse Kante hits his first free throw of the night Hes been perfect from the field However two for two 15point lead for the Panthers Pass inside to Hab Havent been able to get him going tonight He takes the jumper and hits Thats a nice shot there Very quality look for Hav there Panthers have to not allow them to do that again Giving Spoon working on Wabude He has the match up he likes here Hes looking to attack Crosses over Wabude Well defended by the Eagle but a fade away jumper from Witherspoon Really nice shot there Eagles push tempo Hab fires up a triple Wont go Indraitis collects Witherspoon looks to get inside again Kick out Conte Three Too strong And last touch by the Panthers Eastern Michigan will take over Witherspoon isolating there Tween behind cross spin half spin Doing it all for the Panthers there Thats a nice shot there Tough shot Nelly you can tell hes starting to get more and more comfortable with the college game each game he plays Definitely You know especially when youre on a team full of new guys too Its going to take some time to get adjusted And I think hes hes having a great time just getting more accustomed with the college game Witherspoon was three for 13 from the floor on his season coming into tonight Different story here Hes got 10 points on four of six shooting and hes connected on both of his threepoint attempts That was a really good pass there by Hav dropped by that was a really nice pass Witherspoon will be the one to set up the offense this trip down for the Panthers Alex Dunning with eight to shoot inside to Corin Goes up strong Couldnt get the shot to fall in the Eagles Addison Patterson had a great first half He has not scored in the second half for Eastern and that time sets up a nice shot for Hab and Eastern Michigan not going away They got this lead for Pin at 12 Witherspoon gunning wide open three too strong Miner tips it to Corin for the jam Great rebound there and pass before he even hit the ground Thats thats what winning basketball looks like right there for Polo How about five rebounds for the 6 feet tall fifthear player Demarco Meyer Three didnt go but he tips it Count there by Corin Point guard into a great one 100 You know as a point guard you have to always be one step ahead of everybody And I can tell with DeMarco Miner that hes doing his film study and hes doing all the extra things that make a a good point guard a good point guard and hes going to continue to excel if he continues to do the thing the little things every single game like hes doing now Brandon Cummings of course out tonight with that lower body injury Told you at the top of the show Panthers will be relying on Demarco Miner a little bit more and he has certainly risen to the occasion and he gets a swipe away there Miner drives kicks Stunning junior thought about it from the corner And now Miner working on Sanders looking for Corin on the inside And Nelly to continue on Miner here You mentioned that word winning plays right And thats what Jeff Cable told us at Shootaround is he is a guy who impacts winning He spent two seasons at SIU Edwardsville SIU Edwardsville had 11 wins the year before he got there and they improved their win total to 19 when they added him He was first team all Ohio Valley in 2024 and just a guy that is not afraid to go for any loose ball go up for any rebound and at six feet tall Really impressive what he brings Hes really impressive Hes really really is you know like you said and you alluded to the winning plays he makes is just its something that you cant teach you know he has something in him that allows him to navigate the game in a way that other guys arent just doing Thats why hes been successful at every stop hes had The Panthers a big spark in that Friday win over Longwood and has them up 16 right here midway through the second half Trying to go three and 0 to start the year This is the time of the game here where high major team has to be a high major team and put this game kind of away here Eastern Michigan a team picked to finish ninth in the preseason poll of the MAC Corin comes in and a great swat away and out of bounds will give Eastern Michigan five on the shot clock on the inbound Great extra effort here by Cam and Amamari just to impact that shot and end up getting the block Great wall up by Conte And down to Patterson Remember shot clock now at two Working on Conte Drive and the fadeaway shot Well taken by Patterson Impressive stuff on the athletic move to the rim Im not too sure he got that one off in time Yeah I think youre right One more look Great angle from our crew And yeah just about a split second too late huh Yep just a split second You know I always as a player when I see a guy basket is under review for potential shot clock violation Always get a little antsy about that because you only have 3 seconds I would have took the jump shot Yeah One more look just to be sure but I think we know which way this ones going to go Yeah looks like its still in his hand when that light goes on and expect that this one will not count for Addison Patterson Great crew of officials here tonight After further review its a shot clock violation No basket The game clock will be reset to 1045 Castell makes the announcement and no basket for Addison Patterson This is going to be a very important 2 minutes and 45 seconds here for Pit until the next media timeout They have to enforce their will here Panthers struggling a little bit from the field in the second half compared to the first Theyre just five of 14 from the floor in half number two cheering Those are the plays that coach Cables going to lose his mind over right there You know Ive seen him yell at me for plays like that right there You got to be connected as a team What would he yell at you for For making that pass right there When nobody was looking he would yell at me Pretty same way you just seen him yell defense cheering That was a good wall up there by Papocante You know we spoke to Polos winning plays all game but this here is not a play that Polos going to want Hes going to want that play back later for sure Situs defending Hart on the inside Another tough basket made by the senior from Miami Carlos Hart having himself a night up to 16 points for the Eagles Hes such a crafty finisher around that rim Weve seen it time and time again tonight where he gets to the basket Good things are happening for Eastern Michigan cheering Carlos Hart another newcomer for the Eagles cheering He had 14 points a week ago in their opener Is now up to 17 tonight after the made free throw If Eastern Michigan is going to get themselves back into this game now is the time for them Theyre going to have to increase their intensity their pace their toughness and their togetherness And meanwhile Noyas injur Sitis picks up his fourth foul So he is on the bench for the Panthers Only other Panther in foul trouble is Cam Corin with three You see Andrew Situs with the nine first half points really gave them a spark but has been limited in how much he can be out there due to the foul trouble Sometimes its an adjustment when you go from sitting on coming off the bench to being a starter You know he had a few fouls that Im sure he wish he can get back as well Mentioned Intercitis and Corin Witherspoon just with the two for the Panthers Three ball misfired there from Alderink Witherspoon driving turning around and hitting Omari Witherspoon settling in and finding some rhythm offensively That was a very good job of him playing off two feet there under control And you get a good shot out of that every time you go down there playing under control Witherspoon very efficient Five for seven on the night cheering Sanders working on doning Drives inside and a foul called against the Panthers John Sanders II will take some free ones Its a great attack move here Playing off two feet there Turn around Get that close to the rim Hes going to make those nine times out of 10 Thats a great shot And Nelly players like Amari Witherspoon freshman for the Panthers trying to adjust to the ACC in the college game A game like this can really work wonders for him Sometimes you just need to remind yourself of what you can do And Im sure in high school he scored a lot more than 12 points in a game but an efficient night like this where hes starting to look more comfortable can give him the confidence he needs going into bigger games later in the season Definitely Thats what I was going to say 100 can enhance your confidence when you go out here and you perform well Panthers gave it away on the inbound but get it right back Heres Miner Have some numbers Miner takes it himself and finishes with the left hand Great take Veteran guy there Im sure he didnt like that halfway turnover so he went down there and got it back on the offensive end Drive there wont go for Alderink Gets the rebound himself and a foul called against Pit now Both teams in the bonus One more look Suip on the inbound Good pressure though from the Eagles Miner takes it himself the whole way cheering Alderinkos one for two but an offensive rebound for Eastern Michigan Hab from the short corner cheering wont go Su Lia pushing pace Its three on two up to Conte who lost it Now Eagles the other way They have the numbers Corner three Sanders got it This is their type of basketball like we alluded to earlier PIT Pace intensity toughness and togetherness Thats what theyre doing right now Theyre putting it on display Minor step back triple Not there Once again the pace for Eastern Michigan Sanders goes up and is denied And Miner is going to slow things down get his team organized Eagles are not going away Eastern Michigan has outscored Pit 22 to 20 in the second half Witherspoon behind his back spinning on Patterson Lost his footing and a foul called cheering Panthers maintain the double digit lead Sure I think if theyre going to battle back in this game theyre going to have to have a balanced attack Its not going to be one player whos going to bring them back Theyre going to have to do it all together just like their coach said So looking forward to music seeing how they finish up this game Now Addison Patterson is on the bench now with four fouls here in the second half And both teams have been a bit more physical in the second than they were in the first You see Panthers in the double bonus Eastern Michigan in the bonus with just under eight minutes to go Witherspoon makes the first of two from the line Heres Rubio Goes baseline kicks out ham Sixfoot DeMarco Miner currently defending Habh Hab Lets see if Eastern Michigan can take advantage They do find the big down low and Miner commits the foul That was a good possession there by Eastern Michigan Utilizing their mismatch down low and get making sure they get the ball to have there They had the switch that they wanted but they couldnt get to it Great pass here utilizing a mismatch Whats that feel like when youre a cheering point guard getting switched on to a big Its one of the worst feelings ever I can imagine it feels similar for the bigs when we have them out in space Yeah but it really really does not Its no fun down there when theyre 69 Theres nothing you can do Got to just foul them like Demarco did there Send them to the line They got to earn them cheering Miner making Hab earn these ones And he does go two for two Mr Michigan putting that press back together now Throwing multiple different defensive looks at the Panthers And theyre back to zone 10 to shoot Miner kicks out Dunning Three in the air Got it Count the basket Thats a very big shot there for the Panthers And a very big shot for Barry Dunning there Big shot for Barry Dunning Jr And the second time tonight the Panthers have drawn a foul on a threepoint attempt If Im not mistaken I believe thats Barry Dunnings first made three of the season so far If Im not mistaken thats a big correct big time development here for Pit We talked in the first half about his potential the way he can score the basketball Hes shown that throughout his career and starting to get off cheering to a good start here tonight Dunning in transition bounce pass Suipa wont get the finish And Dunning collects kicks out Witherspoon fakes drives kicks And Dunning Jr looked like he had his heels out of bounds Thats still a good sign for the Panthers to see him making shots like that And sometimes just good to see the smile too right For sure Just having fun playing the game you love you know Our conversation today with Jeff Cable about Barry Dunningham Jr where he mentioned that he started his career at Arkansas and then didnt get much playing time there transferred to UAB then to South Alabama and can shake your confidence a bit when you start out in an SEC program a successful one like Arkansas you dont necessarily get the minutes and maybe start to wonder if you have what it takes to play at the power conference level And Barry Dunning Jr good to see him having a solid night here tonight So the Eagles trying to hang around in this game but they have made just one of their last nine field goal attempts Witherspoon beats Patterson goes baseline kicks out Dunning thought about it Back to Witherspoon Witherspoon reverse layup wont go Jeff Cable showing some frustration on the pit bench Now an alleyoop attempt to Patterson Hell pull it out instead Baseline drive here Rubio twisted around Hab finds an open heart Hes been hot and wont get it that time Rebound Conte Another great rebound there by Conte Good seal Great seal down low by Cam Corin there If you catch the ball that low its guaranteed to be a basket That was a great seal by him there Corin now up to 16 points on the night 32 minutes for Cam Corin He has not been out of this game very much Have there he goes again Those are great quality looks for him there Hes not going to miss that too often Have more productive in the second half tonight 11 of his 15 coming in this second period Panthers largest lead was 18 back in the first half Now Witherspoon squares up a three and misfires out of bounds The Panthers just havent quite been able to break it open just yet Nelly to the point where youre comfortable Great seal here early in transition by Cam Great recognition by Polo there to get it to him And you get two feet in the paint like that thats a great quality look for for the Panthers and defended by Mohamd Habhab We came into the night wondering how Habh Hab would deal with some of the bigs for Pittsburgh Certainly a different test than the one he faced a week ago against Georgia State And hes starting to come alive in the second half but you can tell Corin providing a problem on the inside for the Eagles And now a foul called against Pittsburgh here Looks like itll go against Barry Dunning Jr going to be the third on him And they will reinsert Noyas injuritis with his four fouls and Jeff Cable hes going to be doing a lot of that when you got new players coaching him up Definitely Yeah hes definitely going to have to coach these guys up a little more You know theres things that we talked about earlier that Jeff hes not all the way satisfied with his team yet So hes going to have to spend the extra time in this new era of college basketball to build up his players cheering Arts free throw too strong and DeMarco Miner with the ball in his hands He is the type of player Nelly you just feel comfortable when he has it You do Hes He has a calming presence about himself able to get us into the offense and navigate the screens And Situs goes baseline Six on the timer Kante hand off Miner step back Jay buries it at the buzzer Great step back shot there at the buzzer Once again Demarco Miner doing what he does best you know being a winner making all the winning plays Puts his team ahead by 15 Under three and a half to play from the pee Eastern Michigan certainly running out of time Drive Ellison kick out Green got Witherspoon in the air Lefthanded shot wont go and Wet fouled on the rebound 306 to go 7358 is the Panther lead Nelly how about this guy Step back right there man Hes shown everything thats needed for a great point guard in this league you know 12 points seven rebounds six assists four steals and only one turnover Thats an excellent performance for a Panther point guard right there Demarco Miner is leading the Pit team tonight in minutes assists steals and he is tied for the team lead in rebounds And this is the 11th time in his career that he has exceeded 10 points five rebounds and five assists is very impressive stuff from the transfer from Oregon State and Jeff Cable Nelly hes got an eye for guard talent and he has been able to produce some excellent guards and recruit some excellent guards You of course were one of them and its starting to become part of his track record at pit It definitely is You know he recruits dogs You know when I look at Demarco Miner thats what I see I see a dog who is going to do whatever it takes to win these games cheering Eastern Michigan looking to increase their pressure here Three minutes left in this game Theyre going to need something some things to happen Eastern Michigan thinking they want to challenge that call They immediately start motioning to their head coach Stan Heath You know we had a really good seat and I think I would have challenged it as well Its a pretty good So well step aside as the officials take one more look A call that Eastern Michigan really needs to go their way Down 13 under three to play I think they might be right the out of bounds play and Heath not sure if he agrees with the ruling from the officials but nonetheless Eastern Michigan loses its one challenge They lose a timeout as well and they are down 13 with 258 to play That looked like it hurt He caught a shoulder right to the chin there Yeah that hurt And you see Hab clearly shaken up after the play Sends Papakante to the line And hes now one for five from the strike here tonight Apam still shaking it off Panthers leaving a lot of points at the free throw line They are now 10 for 21 from the charity strike on the on the game Ive played for coach Cable so I already know theyre going to shoot a ton of free throws next time theyre in practice Patterson spins on Indraitis and gets his first field goal of the second half with just two and a half minutes to go Theyre going to need their veteran guys to make a push at this thing if theyre going to do it Miner with some tight defense from Sanders and they call him for the push off screaming And it was John Sanders II with some tight pressure on Demarco Miner You saw Stan Heath wanting the officials to take a look at that one too to see if there was possibly a flagrant foul They did not take a look Now Conte gets the rebound off the threepoint attempt and a foul on Eastern Michigan And to commit that one 90 ft from the basket gives you the sense that maybe the Eagles arent concerned about sending Papa to the free throw line I think theyre doing what they call a hacka papa right there laughter Hack them full court Send them to the line Make them earn them Hacka papa Sanders was not holding back much was he He wasnt laughter Kante makes him pay on the front end Papacante just a 63 free throw shooter last season Of course nice to see him staying healthy having an impact He missed his first season at Pit due to a knee injury and like you mentioned really broke out in that Ohio State game last season Big part of why Pit was able to get that win in Columbus That was a key victory for them early in the season And Conte eight points five rebounds here tonight Panthers up 14 Hart kick out Rubio swirls out and Witherspoon gathers Miner wisely will slow things down for the Panthers Time is on the Panther side here so they need to use as much of that clock as they can And Eastern Michigan running out of time They are not fouling So the Panthers just about 90 seconds away from improving to 30 on the season Minor shot in the corner is blocked out of bounds but a shot clock violation Heres the ball back to the Eagles Even though it feels like that was a bad possession They wait they wasted the entire shot clock there So for game management purposes that was not the worst play to happen You agree with Eastern Michigan not fouling here late too far out of hand I do I think if you go if you can score here then you maybe make it interesting maybe then you can start calling fouls or going for fouls or Hart has had an amazing game man finish around the rim every time he gets down there we seem like were saying two points for him well Stan Heath has not given up and they are tending to Carlos Hart down underneath the basket Stan Heath has taken a full timeout His team down 12 with a minute seven to play and you said it Carlos Hart has been tremendous 19 points eight for 16 from the floor That is not an easy bucket to make at all Everything hes had today has been some really really tough You can see his calf cramping right there too Thats never fun either as a player music Cramping up is the worst 12point lead for the Panthers Minute seven remaining It looking like they are headed for a 3 and 0 record here them off to a good start before some big games coming up And were going to go back real quick and take a look at another Panther guard Nelly that was a big piece of what you guys did in 2223 Jamari is Burton all ACC first team in the 2223 season Huge reason why you guys got back to the tournament And there he is tonight He has joined the Panther staff as a graduate manager And Nelly this is a really nice addition to Jeff Cables team It is for sure You know JB has the experience of someone who was first team all league and he was a part of the last team that went to the NCAA tournament from Pittsburgh So you know hes a great addition for the this team this current team because he can show them what is what is needed and what it takes to get back to the tournament Jeff Cable said when he coached Jamarius Burton he always thought he would make a good coach and he tried playing professionally a little bit after he finished his career at Pit and is from Charlotte North Carolina Jeff Cable actually said it was last season in the game at NC State Amarius Spurton was at the game He met with coach Cable and expressed his interest in possibly coming back in a role on the coaching staff and before you know it he joins this pit team as a graduate manager and has really made a difference Demarco Miner told us last week how nice it is to have a guy like Burton who has played in the NCAA tournament and first team all ACC honors Thats a guy you want to have on your bench for sure Witherspoon spins and hits Took him on a nice dance move right there to send him home Foul called against the Panthers again Pittsburgh now with 19 fouls in the game and that is the fifth on Cameron Corin So productive night for Corin 167 rebounds He only had one foul at halftime Got into more foul trouble in the second half Picked up four in period number two and now is replaced by Papakante So 36 seconds left to go Nelly we start to look forward for both of these teams The Panthers have a big one on Thursday Theyre headed down 79 to play West Virginia and Morgantown That should be a fun game You know thats always fun The backyard brawl Its what a lot of Pittsburgh fans live for A lot of a lot of West Virginia fans live for it as well So Im looking forward to it just as they are That game will be 600 Thursday the backyard brawl Good to see that rivalry renewed over the past few years Panthers getting the win in each of the last two meetings with West Virginia Sixsec difference here Panthers cannot quite dribble it out but they will improve to 3 and 0 cheering for the third straight year here under Jeff Cable who turned around the program in year five 2012223 season cable he never stops coaching never stops coaching thats thats what a great coach does you know especially when you got freshman and guys who never played together its good to see Nelly
