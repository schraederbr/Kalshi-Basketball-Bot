Tommy was interesting I say hey did you have a special message for your seniors to like just go out and duplicate duplicate what you did the last game Brion pass hasnt been to the line a whole lot only 20 attempts prior to today for Music pass so the leading scorer for NC State this season Marcus Hill Jr will enter past leaves after the free throws Marcus Hill Jr averages just over 11 and a half points per game to lead the way for the pack this Music season Cleveland surveys the situation nowhere to go top of the Scouting Report Brandon Johnson forced up the shot against Middlebrooks play was clean according to the officials traveling violation and a turnover the Styles turns it over you see both teams coming out no one really being able to establish themselves offensively last time you see Styles a little bit of a shuffle of the feet both teams trying to find a little rhythm early on Brian hard to come by so far and that one goes out of bounds into the front row miscommunication by teammates a lot of that too was styles on the rotation huku basically saw two guys on him and pass the ball not realizing he didnt have a a clear passing Applause Music Lane Styles now little bit of daylight oh over Cleveland for Styles and good good play by Styles realize that Cleveland when he faced up on him gave him a little bit of a distance obviously we talk about the fact that how hes been playing over the last five games 16 points a game gets him on the books Miami trying to work it in deep with Johnson to go back out to Cleveland against two and three Defenders and styles was all over it Hill wants the Run cant calculate the angle mid Brooks comes over the top its going to be out of pounds in Miami basketball trying to crash the boards Will Middlebrooks Tom watch this La this last play by dant Styles gets a little bit of a mid post realize that Matthew Clevelands giving him distance thats one of those things again hes going to face up and a guy thats got a good offensive Rhythm we talked about his numbers over the last five games gains are 6 and 24 overall this season lost that George Tech on Tuesday 8974 they shot it well Music 44 long pass up ahead

win against pit Miamis missed its last five shots Music Bryan paa got Hill in the air driving on the Baseline and a foul call Divine Ugo chukwu will go the wins for Jim Lena one of the greatest to ever do it you talk about his success at George Mason and then here at Miami Miami could use some type of offensive flow right now one of nine just 64 from the line this season for number 99 The Freshman Miami has missed its last five shot attempts its a 100 run for NC State and it stops there with the free throw the Freshman from Sugarland Texas and Tom what youve seen is that NC State their shot quality has a lot better than what Miamis been able to to do doing a good job of breaking the paint getting a second and third options Miamis got to do a little bit more than just go east to west on the perimeter with the ball mcneel has come in hell shoot right away and itll rattle out weve seen that a few times so far both ends of the Music Court Miami tried to overcome a 16point halftime deficit against Georgia Tech came up a little bit short Lance Terry for the jackets had 31 points that was a career high for him that was on Tuesday ston McCrae AR King three is on net and great play and recognition by ogre CH basically what he realized he broke the paint forced NC State to help and that get State McCrae Wide Open Play I get them going 31st threepointer of the season for him 120 threepointers now in his career mcneel at the other end does the same thing for three no hesitation by mcneel good rotation mcconell OK Conor realiz his wide open defensive shift Paul mcneel Jr the

buttons today against NC State a little soft follow away baa and Bea is one of those guys you give him the rock he can go get you a bucket this a guy thats number 10 in the top ESPN as a recruit got a lot of upside Connell from the corner thats going to be a two according to the officials NC stay doing a good job of being able to move the ball OK again a guy thats good well put ball on the floor knocks down that three Huey had a chance after the Miss and a foul coming up against huie for Miami after the Miss and you watch that last play and you see St CR wide open off of the ugu pin down and then again McNeil giving himself great elevation on the shot follow through and then this last one and then the two worst B worst shot in basketball time worming that foot on the line youre going to shoot it out there for a three make sure you get those three behind I love okon what hes been able to do so our officials are Adam James Trey stons and Adam F the reason Tommy morresy was replaced his wife Sam had a baby this morning a young baby boy Miller Thomas joins the team so congrats to the of Tommy morrisy thats Cleveland on the run and nice move by Matthew Cleveland gets the ball off the rebound and goes Coast to ghost just over 17 points per game for Cleveland 29 Points of Team high in the loss at Georgia Tech this week for Miami also had seven boards thats Hill carving his way in and he why you you play you play the tournament you play every game because get a quick Qui quick run simply amazing run number 10 seed captures the title took out the top three seeds to the final four for the first time since Jimmy ve cut down the Nets in Albuquerque New Mexico you see North Carolina state with a little bit of a extending of their but pressure by the way when NC State won the ACC tournament Brian back in 83 just eight teams in the league now we have 18 wow and three of them arent going to Charlotte for the tournament thats banana unfortunately 18 teams my God the NCAA tournament field was 52 teams and remember they could have lost right away they beat pepperine in double overtime to start the tournament and they beat UNLV by a point in the first and second round in Boise Idaho how about that but but thats the thing though Tom is that I I remember back when I we won the ACC tournament in 90 you know won the tournament went in two the NCAA tournament we knocked off some teams that we werent supposed to be to make to the final four and thats one of the things and of playing in the ACC tournament as you see Matthew Cleveland come up with that that Miss not a to get that one go down Charlotte was kind to you in 1990 Brian as Hill very kind every time I pass through Charlotte I always blow them a kiss Brian Oliver the MVP of the 1990 ACC tournament contested in Charlotte North Carolina 70 to 61 of the championship game against Virginia you had a couple of pretty good teammates too didnt you yeah a lot of them I you know Dennis Scott keny Anderson shout out as you see Matthew Cleveland continue to go downhill and again we talked about him the fact that last two games averaging almost 20 right at 27 points you can tell that hes come out very aggressive trying to get downhill hardworking player in this kans lineup as we mentioned he was out there well before the start of our game shooting jumpers from around the perimeter the interesting thing was he had about 10 managers rebounding for him cuz he wanted that ball back as soon as he could because he wanted some high volume Reps for that warmup well heres the thing is that you get those shots to go early you get a little rhythm you see that hes comeing in with the mentality and they definitely need it right now as they try to find some offense that rolls out of bounds and back to the canes Mis miscommunication between oano and Hatfield Hardley Strong finish for NC State at home this season Brian they won their last three home games the pit game also wake and BC two and two in their last four games with the wins against wake and pit losses at Georgia Tech and at Syracuse for NC State Music KES Whittle that shot clock down to five Brandon Johnson the senior from Raleigh North Carolina taking on the pack traveling from Raleigh and that goes out of bounds into NC State and great defense by oconnell that last time you saw Johnson trying to get the contact just walled up and didnt foul good defense without fouling Music n State also looking for its first road win of the season 0 and 10 and 0 and N in conference play they go all the way across Middlebrooks is on the weak side to save it to Hill ball did not hit the rim shot clock is at six hell needs to shoot it thats Applause offline Kanes trying to run it up looking for a three Cleveland was fighting for the rebound with middle Brooks and oconnell J Jaden Taylor picks up the foul for NC State thats his first a sixpoint Advantage right now in the first half for the Wolfpack mcneel will come back in so great to have you with us on CW Courtside Saturday Georgia teeken wake to follow us Infinity racing from Phoenix Arizona also today on the CW Tom wormy along with Brian Oliver the 1990 MVP at the ACC tournament in Charlotte North Carolina thats the destination next week Baseline chumper Cleveland and thats an aggressive match up between Cleveland and also Styles you see both of them going in and styles being aggressive Cleveland put his ball hand put his head down watch this play Tom worming where you see Matthew Cleveland realized can get to a spot Elevate you see a little bit of a contact being able to stay focused get a chance to go for the threepoint of the oldfashioned way so Styles picked up the foul Cleveland completes the old school threepoint play for the senior from Atlanta Georgia played two years in the Florida state program second year here in Coral Gables for Cleveland Taylor Styles mcneel along the perimeter MC connells in the corner middle Brooks has the basketball the Clemson transfer acrobatic shot he hits the deck and Middlebrooks was fouled hell go to the free throw line and middle Brooks did a good job realizing weak side help was coming on the double team opted to go the opposite way Brandon Johnson picked up the foul for Miami put Middlebrooks at the free throw line 74 on the season nobody gets there more for NC State the Middlebrooks coming up next second half of our CW Courtside Saturday season finale Georgia Tech faces wake Fours tight battle for ACC tournament seating Yellow Jackets demon daks coming up next only on the CW the only spots we know right now and it could be in a different order Duke Louisville Clemson all have earned a double buy its a scrap below that includes North Carolina trying to get the double buy at the ACC tournament Georgia Tech Wake game is going to be a big game for both teams because a wake again still trying to position themselves for a bit for the NCAA tourn for short take you see me the Cleveland throws it away the regular season in the ACC everybody that has qualified will go to Charlotte next week third time at the Spectrum Center saw the tournament there in 08 and 2019 North Carolina one and 08 Duke won in 2019 and thats a three mcneel and McNeil is giv NC State a nice shot in the arm from behind the ark most of the part right now in this first half all NC State by committee offens is generally been by Matthew Cleveland 10 points so far in the first half Cleveland are double figures for the 21st time this season and 88th in his career Johnson with a fall away in the paint nice move by Johnson got a little separation between he and middle Brooks I like giving him a a touch in the PO to let him go to work so he had 16 points in his double double Brian at Georgia Tech for Johnson all of his points came in the second half mcneel again oh wow and he gets a high five from ke Kevin ke almost jumped off the floor see that every day Brian not at all want a friendly role to McNeil watch his last play McNeil who had hit his previous three you see the close by state McCrae on the foul and then looks like its going to come out gets a friendly roll opportunity for a fourpoint play seen a couple of nice bounces like that for NC State of the first half in enemy territory Paul mcneel is a good looking player for this NC State program as a freshman yeah get a lot of elevation on his jump shot good touch around the rim as well Johnson was there after the Miss by Bea and the foul will go against mcneel first on mcneel and Johnson did a good job of being able to follow the ball two guys were focused on bethia and he cleans up with the opportunity that offensive glass just couldnt come up with before the foul Johnson hands off Bea drives into the paint against Styles and he traveled as Styles tied him up Styles is a really good Defender does a good job of being able to defend without fouling that last time bethia came in took too many steps and styles just made physical force him into that turnover how about NC State its made eight field goals in the first half Ryan four of those are three pointers they average about seven made threes per game remember they made 10 in the win against pit earlier this week at home at Lenovo Center McNeil again little scissor kick you can call that a heat check hes going giving himself a chance he said Im feeling it Cleveland at the other end beats two Defenders including Middlebrooks foul on the play Cleveland to the line and thats one of the things thats going to allow Matthew Cleveland to possibly play at the next level is his ability to be able to play through contact and knock down shots watch this last play when you advance the ball and he gets down here and then kind of gets between two guys finishes with that off hand least Matthew Cleveland already 13 points in this first half Cleveland has scored 20 plus in nine of his last 11 games as NC State will put out some fresh legs Middlebrooks picked up the foul as second so he goes to the bench for Kevin Keats and back to Cleveland hes done a good job of being able to keep this close and keep Miami in it Miami needs to do a better job of getting some stops and then someone else help him offensively so Brandon hutley Hatfield number one for NC State is into the lineup this is style straight away Rock the three ball for the back and weve talked about the fact that Styles is one of those guys thats going to play hard on both ends of the floor doesnt hesitate we talked about the fact over the last five games averaging about 17 points you can tell hes in a good offensive momentum right now two for two on threepointers for Styles he now has 50 threepointers on the season that leads the club falling down hitting the three Bea both teams starting to warm up a little bit with their offense you saw a little struggle earlier on Music was a sketchy start by both teams but they have settled in in the first half Styles against a double Applause Music team we mentioned that Matthew Cleveland needed someone to come and help him out and watch J Bea right here that could have easily been a fourpoint play that last time knocks down that shot and back to Styles doing a good job as well so Styles at the free throw line 72 on the Music season CW Sports Saturday rolls on as Georgia Tech hits the Winston Salem for a battle against Wake Forest then we cap the day with rayon the infinity NASCAR series Roars into Phoenix for a showdown in the desert CW Sports Saturday continues next only on the CW we certainly thank everybody involved with CW Courtside Saturday as we wrap up the regular season today its been a wonderful year great to be alongside Brian Oliver here at the watso center and our talented production crew bringing you this match up between NC State and Music Miami Cleveland able to rise up to grab that one then he fires away and styles gets the rebound if youre mat Matthew Cleveland went in doubt just put it up last time the turnover 31st alltime meeting between the teams as Styles hangs and misses but is fouled in the process looks like Johnson picks it up for Miami weve seing in this first half you see Styles put a lot of pressure on Miami defense again this is a guy we talked about that could face up and knock down to three that last time trying to get to the rim a physical player that does not shy away from contact so Styles at the stripe has a team nine of 11 so far free throws for NC State add one more they are 13th in the conference this year 72 as a team from the strike I think you see what the difference is as far as a ninepoint lead is that NC state has done a better job of being able to get downhill and get some contact and some fouls and get to the free throw line in add in the 53 threepointers that NC state has made in this first half in fact their last seven games prior Brian theyve averaged nine made threes per game so they picked it up in that category to close out the season thats reason why they won their last three home games absolutely and you can see the continuity that theyve been able to play with has pretty much been by committee Miami this first half majority of their points have coming from Matthew Cleveland Kanes trying to snap a sixgame losing streak on the last day of the regular season thats Cleveland not high enough on the square was looking for a call and did not get it inside of four and a half minutes to go in the first half pass Loops it in Huntley Hatfield Hugo chuku knocks it away and out of bounds and good good recovery and good defense by oo chuku realized that Huntley Hadfield down there had him on a mismatch and he just stayed solid was able to come off the ball Connell races over to grab it pass gets into the lane misses with the left Cleveland one power dribble elevates Styles is up there too to meet him in midair mind you and what about the play of recovery by styles to get back would looked to be a probably easy shot in baskets watch this replay and you see Styles come up and in what could have been a foul before that able to get through and and come with a with a block last win for the canes mid February right here in this floor against Syracuse out of the corner knocking down a three for Schwartz and Schwarz is another one of those guys a talented freshman number 50 in the top 100 ESPN guys got a a tremendous future just a two for Schwarz on that attempt couple of Threes made by Miami on seven tries in this first half entry passes Styles free throw line turn around what was that maneuver Brian well heres the thing is that Miami Miami was playing that zone styles did a good job of understanding you get it right there in the middle does a little bit of a pouette realiz that he face up and hes already fing it six straight games and double digits in scoring for dant Styles the senior from Kinston North Carolina heres Cleveland Slams on the brakes and hits the front rim everything but the finish for zero for Miami and North Carolina State hes doing a good job of being able to close possession great pass by m McNeil over to hly headfield how about the senior from Clarksville Tennessee going on a rim rocker averages seven points per game and five rebounds best shooting percentage on the team for Huntley Hatfield now granted most of his shots are close to the rim like that one you still got to make them you still got to make them though time wow that was one of those instances with Styles really good defense and then be comes in with better offense again this kid has got a tremendous upside because he is a bucket getter not afraid to shoot High degree of difficulty in the corner spinning around and launching one weve got a 10point game just over two minutes to go for Brion pass OK conell Go chuku Runs it up finds Cleveland on the wing for three Matthew Cleveland and great point guard paid by Ogo chuk you get transition and you realize you try to find your score you realize Matthew Clevelands got it going get it over to him and knocks down that three Miamis a nice little mini run themselves all in one motion for Cleveland and a three ball for the canes weak side fight Huntley Hatfield elevating against Schwarz foul called against NC State will step a huge shot in the arm right now that has allowed them to have this lead eighth season for Kevin Keats 151 wins as the NC State head coach 11th overall over 200 wins in his coaching career final 140 watsco Center Pearl Gables Florida CW Courtside Saturday Hill elevates Johnson up high for the rebound Johnson will show and go and the kick Cleveland got the defender in the air and Huntley Hatfield tried to lean into him Huntley Hatfields behind the play after the contact it looked like he took a blow on the contact between He and Matthew Cleveland may have gotten a wind knocked out of Applause him conell and pass up top final minute of play inside on the shot clock for pass oh Styles try to come in from the weak side Hill trying to save it right at the Miami bench to O conell wow what a play first of all what a save by Marcus Hill to be able to get the ball over to aono and he knocks down that three in Miami you played solid defense youve got to close out that possession with the defensive rebound five points in the first three of the game for Michael oconnell 105 career threepointers thats what happens when you play in 161 games three years at Stanford where he played 89 games for o Connell lead back up to 10 its been as large as 12 in the first half Forin State there about a 5sec difference game and shot wol watch Mark is H and the balls going out of bounds and you see right there really great recruiter for Duke last two seasons helped Duke have the number one recruiting classes this age you got to be able to get players in there to be able to turn your program around and remember in the regional final NC State beat Duke to get to the final four last year Clemson was in a regional final as well so three of the five teams got to the elite eight and then NC State on to the final four after its run at the ACC tournament Johnson with a second effort twisting off the glass he missed foul his call and its middle Brooks and great second and third effort by Johnson realized he had a smaller pass on him even when he was trying to finagle his aim angle there I would have loved to see M dip in in and make sure that he can knock that down but it gives him opportunity go to the free throw line vagle his angle Brian Oliver Im gonna put that on a tshirt for you wow put that on a tshirt for you youre nice like that Brian Oliver I am nice with it I thought you knew or with it sorry at the free throw line Johnson go might as well have a little fun on the last day of the regular seon last game of the season its been great to be with you and Gman and John Henson Tom brenaman everybody else whos joined us dur in the course of the Music Season empty from the free throw line for the canes NC State 12 and 18 on the year five and 14 in conference play if they win today they can get their first road win of the year theyve been good with the halftime lead this season 11 and four Styles out of the corner its a three ball in front of his own bench and great recognition by Ben Middlebrooks I thought he had a wide open layup but he opted to get the ball out to Styles and again the guy thats leading them in scoring at 14 the first half knocks down another three to come up with 17 how about Styles three for three from Beyond The Arc and then he deflects that ball out of bounds it will be Miami basketball and watch this last play you see wide open Ben Ben MD Brooks realize that hes got a better shootter a better shot in styles styles knocks it down he is RO defensively for NC State the issue now middle Brooks has three personal fouls and Coach ke told us hes a key ingredient to defensive success that he can stay in the Music game State McCrae dancing around in the corner trying to save it thatll be a shot clock violation NC State basketball and great defensive possession by NC State because what they did is that they ran another man at Matthew Cleveland opting to make someone else from Miami beat them because again hes been the sole guy all afternoon thats been able to hurt them Force the ball out of his hand and then get a shot clock valuation Styles has 17 points that leads everybody well above a season average of 11 points per game did have a double double against pit thatll bounce off for Taylor fight for the loose ball middle Brooks ell Ugo truku in the vicinity out of bounds and kans ball again and Middlebrooks has to display some discretion with his three personal fouls Schwartz comes into the lineup for the canes Tom ucnc State continue to extend their defense and for Miami theyve got to find some way to get some easy offense because now if youre in North Carolina state every time the ball goes into beneath the free throw line you send another man you got to force somebody else from Miami to beat you right now theyve got to find another secondary score Miamis going to have to defy recent history they are one 19 trailing at half timee its Johnson with the jam Johnson did a great job of being able to show the ball and put middle Brooks into the parachute Club B on that was able to run right to the rim from the dunck and you know theres a little extra juice for Johnson who is from Ry North Carolina spent three years in East Carolina first year with the canes Applause Cleveland into the corner that rims out for Schwarz foul was called in the Music aftermath watch this last pump fake birds will fly and then the sea Parts wide open you see Johnson go down for the easy one was that the Red Sea that parted wide open there as Styles picked up his second person I saw what you were doing there Im just emptying the tank its our last game on I know youll be here all afternoon I like that Johnson tough shot wow and thats a matchup that he can win because you already got midle Brooks whos prone to foul sometimes you give him the ball down there thats two consecutive buckets by Johnson I mean thats reasonably good defense against Johnson right it was it was but sometimes it was just an instance of better offense middle Brooks finds his Man styles thats his first Miss from threepoint real estate and missed everything Cleveland cuts to the rim Cleveland lays it in and heres what happens is you get into transition it doesnt allow North Carolina state to be able to pack that lane that last time you allow Cleveland to get downhill you see Kevin ke opting to call a timeout Miami finding their program we come back Miami on a 60 run but they needed to find some offense a good job of being able to get some stops both teams trying to finish strong unfortunately the season ends today for both just 15 teams qualifying for the ACC tournament out of the 18 this year thats the Ed by Cleveland right to Huntley Hatfield and good defense by Cleveland but then McNeil was able to get his hands back on it Huntley Hatfield the beneficiary of that right place at the right time Huntley Hatfield the year at Tennessee two years at Louisville and now in the NC State program intercepts the pass starts the break Styles off the backboard and in for Styles what a response after the six Miami run and it was a bully response by Styles being able to just basically put his head down initiate the contact thats Johnson inside and I like the fact that theyre giving Johnson more touches and hes shown that if you give him the ball down there he can finish gathering himself being patient to come up with that bucket so Johnson who averages over eight points per game almost seven rebounds big on the offensive side early second half for Miami mcneel reversing field Styles shot clock at eight driving not enough on it foul was called so that was styles on the drive Styles he goes at it right from behind the backboard with Styles at the free throw Applause line I just gave him all I now wait a second gave him his flowers and he goes and he just clanks the free throw thats all right hes got one more make the adjustments some Brian Oliver Music form we tried and then you just did that we tried I wanted to let him know you cant leave crumbs on the table Miami with a chance now just over 15 minutes to go in our second half of action Tom wormy Brian Oliver Ugo chuku racing along the Baseline Schwartz gets it on the handoff shot clocks at seven against bounced off him and hits and Nice Shot by swz because he was able to touch the paint initiate the contact and got a little bit of Separation again we talk about the fact that this is a guy tremendous upside because hes got a lot of offensive ability Miami has made its last four field goal attempts to cut the lead to seven Styles fancy glob Trotter dribble dribble and it bounces off Hunley Hatfield in there tried to put it on the floor he gets swarmed swarm swarm by the canes one in very good effort by Huntley Hatfield and then for oo CH choku you like to see players fighting you see right now Miami being able to get back into this game with their aggression especially on their defensive end Hugo chukwu picked up the foul to put Huntley Hatfield at the free throw line and watch Huntley Hatfield out at B you see notuku basically getting his hand in there fouls him gives Huntley half the opportunity to go for two 79 free throw shooter for the senior from Clarksville Tennessee game number 117 in his Music career one more for Huntley Hatfield who last year at Louisville was the fifth leading rebounder in the conference average 13 points per game in 32 games made those look easy you check sneakers from theyre flashy theyre flashy is that a good to put it thats nice yes old heads like you and I can say that and get away with it make your shoes look like mirrors see there thats where you went too far how now I cant take my eyes off him Schwartz just took his eye off the rim a little bit there in Huntley Hatfield and the dazzling shoewear inside pass Hill on the cut that was from ell locked away and Miami is doing a better job with their defense positions and now you get out in transition and the Finish thats swz Miami starting to get back into a Tom wormy they turned it up another notch defensively 5043 1345 to go these look like two teams determined to end the season season with a win mcneel chisling his way foul called looked like Cleveland and Johnson were in the neighborhood defensively and Cleveland will get it NXT hits NYC at MSG for WWE roadblock you will not want to miss this very special episode of NXT this Tuesday 87 Central right here on the CW I like what you did for the little word play I I mean I give the credit to the folks writing the promos for us I had nothing to do with that Paul mcneel is a is a goodlook player look the guy that we saw him shoot the ball from behind The Arc in the first half and also you get up on him with his length hes got a good ability to be able to put the ball on the floor you see keiths give Styles a little bit of a blow much deserved so Bryce herd is also in there along with mcneel and Hill Huntley Hatfield and oconnell foren Applause state herd played about two and a half minutes in the first half hes in for styles for the moment Hunley Hatfield defending on Johnson good match up here Johnson bounces off Huntley Hatfield and misses the follow away I didnt like that shot by Johnson I thought that he can do it pound it one more time as you see Miami getting another turnover Cleveland Cleveland with the slam and Tom youve seen in the second half Miami doing a better job of being able to turn North Carolina State out and get some easy bucket extending their pressure a little bit a little momentum changer how about the 14th game this season for Cleveland with 20 points or more after the jam that spins off the edge of the rim Cleveland has it Schwartz stopping pass Thea for three and what weve seen is that the transition offense especially for young players you get a couple of them to go you see a momentum shift right now Miami on a little run of their Applause own but Thea now two for two from Beyond The Applause Music Applause Ark this is Hill deflected Cleveland bumped by mcneel near midcourt foul was called prior to the dunk at the other end in this fourpoint game youve seen the momentum shift a little bit by both teams and again Miami doing it with their defense active hands you get out get a easy one then Matthew Cleveland goes up for the highight dunp again up there trying to kiss the rim a little bit of a momentum shiting Miamis done it all with their defense 20 points or more for Cleveland in 10 of his last 12 games and three in a row that is a guy who is driving towards the end of this season trying to finish strong as both these teams are Johnson you want to put the ball and go to the basket you dont want to sell weve seen this match up before Johnson was determined to try to get the shot away the pass deflected and out of bounds to NC State so well take a timeout 1149 to go back into this game narrowed it down to four an 114 Run for the canes over the last four minutes Music and if youre in C State you get back to what youre doing see Miami turn up their intensity you got to get to your third and fourth options just be patient ball security is essential herd dribbles into the paint too strong off the glass Johnson pulls it in Hugo truku running the floor just barely missed Here Comes mcneel Taylor driving he had it knocked Away by Johnson recovering defensively it does it not feel like Miamis just taking up their energy another notch in this second half hle Hatfield a little midrange veteran play and good play by Hunley Hatfield a little face up real fast and then Johnson backed off of him so thats eight points for Huntley Hatfield Styles has 19 he leads the way for NC State middle Brooks with his three personal fouls is coming in as well Brian and again as much as the offense has flow through Matthew Cleveland Im not sure that you dont give Johnson an opportunity for a touch here because again try to get him in that low PSE you realize that basically well I think hes out of the game so no way to pass him the ball Music now trying to create something up on the rim not what coach Courtney was looking for exactly there Ugo chuku Ugo chuku when he turned the corner no one came over he had dead set in his mind he was throwing the Aly to huie but then again forars if you get there they dont stop you thats a nice little Runner finish that and go finish that bucket sixpoint game 10point halftime lead for NC State passing oconnell up top middle Brooks Taylor and herd whos got the ball now oconnell thats a three ball midd Brooks took a swipe at it Huey Al this is a time where you want to get the ball over to Matthew Cleveland and let him ball out Thea series of moves caught in the air looking for Huey pass picks it up in the corner and thats where you have beia committed himself too much he said no one stops the ball how about pass and Bea meeting in midair last year Millions watch them on news Nation Monday two of the most prolific voices in media meet again Chris Cuomo Tucker Carlson the conversation continues Monday 87 Central only on news Nation news for all Americans to find news Nation on your screen go to newsnation nowcom pass at the Applause line ston McCrae comes in with pass one more free throw 40 for NC State in the first half dropping off in the second Miami is sizzling 57 one more for pass who was one of eight players in the AC on scholarship as a senior at the same school and and this day and age that is really heard of because again with the nil and transfer portal youve got guys jumping back and forth in and out of programs pron pass had never started a game in his career he started senior night against pit he got the start today Cleveland leaning into the defender creating contact inviting contact and the F on Taylor Brion pass the senior from Reedville North Carolina playing in his 116th game today just one of eight players I know if Cameron hildr is one of those players at at Forest that was one guy that came to mind Im interested who the other six are because thats a rarity you just dont see it anymore you see most players with multiple schools on their resumes not that theres anything wrong with that because its just the changing landscape of college basketball Connell walks it up so Connell spent three years in the Stanford program prior to its arrival into the ACC this season Stanford Cal and SMU which still has a shot at one of those double buys potentially that one up on the rim goes out of bounds and it will stay with NC State thats pass in some discomfort along the Baseline and that last penetration he came down pretty hard trying to get back and then the Challenge from huie knocked him off balance and watch pass gets around the corner and then see huie goes up for it and comes down a little off balance and looked like he got a little ouchy on his elbow right back up and ready to go for Brion pass when its your last game of the season Brian you won every second on that floor poked away from pass a lot of dribbling in tight quarters other way Schartz double fisted Rim rocker and Tom youve seen the the shooting percentage go up in the second half of Miami a lot of it because theyve been able to get in transition you see the blow by great play by Bea excuse me o chuku 26 points in the paint for Miami Cleveland trying to add to it and he got fouled on the way up Matthew Cleveland of the free throw line and the foul theyre whistling Middlebrooks and that would be his fourth Brian but I feel like the CH game changer for Miami has been the defense you see that last play you get it out to to Schwarz for the dunk look at that view right behind the back for backboard dont you remember when you had bounce like that I dont remember back in the day come on Tom warmy I know you had that 48 in vertical or at least the 10 in its been a long time since I went on a rim Bender done other things like that but not a rim Bender middle Brooks coming out hes got the four personals What did Coach Keats tell us just stay on the floor if you can such a key ingredient to success it looked like North Carolina State at some point in the first half was going to run away from this but how about Miami in his second half you Whitt this thing down to three and theyve done it primarily with their defense fact NC State is led by as many as 13 that was early in this second half after leading by 10 at Hal time Huntley Hatfield stayed on the ground and fed Styles when I thought Hunley Hatfield had a good opportunity to shoot but in there was Styles in the back was like hey Im still on fire throws it back out to him he knocks down that three 22 points for Styles fourth game this year with 20 or more for Styles season high as 24 that was against Clemson early February Cleveland misses mcneel despite the Miss eight made threes in the game for NC State Cleveland just backing down size Advantage exploded and you know thats why I say he can play at the next level because you saw he realized he had a smaller player he didnt try to bully him he took his time got him down in the poles a little turn around get away from that double team that was coming Matthew Cleveland 25 points leads all scor scor in our game this afternoon fourpoint game styles ell man what a Play What a play by by Styles because hes the guy thats got the hot hand realize that you let one guy go by you come in and get another and then you throw it right over to oconnell for a three eight points now for oconnell and nine made threes now for NC State after making 10 of the win this week against pit at home Sten McCrae poked away Hill what a defensive play by Hill o Connell looking over at Kevin Applause Keats trying to utilize some of that shot clock perimeter work the Styles had it deflected by Cleveland Clevelands ahead of the field mcneel gets back schwart steps into the three look at the fight with huy and Huntley Hatfield underneath Bryan you got two guys down there fighting for position can get the lead back up to double digits with a three for NC State just when Miami was starting to cut into that lead Hatfield threads the pass Hill gets it lost it on the way up and a foul is called against Miami 6 and 12 minutes to go in do you remember the beginning game I told you Shooters shoot to get hot Shooters shoot to stay hot see who can stay hot down the stretch with 632 to go and Hill at the line for NC State and and as well as Miami has played in this second half with being able to crawl back into this game you like the fact that North Carolina state has been able to withstand Those runs and still hold on this lead opportunity extended up to n nine if he can knock this one Applause Music down so that is 19 of 23 from the free throw line of the game for NC State and theyve done theyve done a really good job of being able to mix it up and get to down downhill and then get to the free throw and be able to execute they are 13th in the ACC as a team in free throw shooting not today impressive from the stripe for the pack Ugo chuku into the pain and kick Cleveland Cleveland around the edge oh that was halfway down and somehow clockwise spin right out of the rim and and thats been a really hard match up for both guys going back and forth this afternoon between Cleveland and styles third foul on Styles and that puts Cleveland at the free throw line 67 senior from Atlanta Georgia this Monday on All American its all new Jordan continues to search for Clues to piece together his fathers past while khil must choose between his father or himself dont miss an all new AllAmerican Monday 87 Central right here on the CW while we have a moment we want to thank everybody from CW Sports from the CW from Raycom Sports all the great women and men who work so hard to bring you all the action all season long in the ACC and that Styles is adding to the point total on the ball swing that last time chose not to knock shoot that three got to his midrange shot no one came on the rotation gives him an opportunity to knock down the midranger a three at the other end and a little frustration by Kevin KS bad rotation that last time you leave ugu chuku wide open allow him to walk into that three Styles with his 24 points he is tied a season High Tru had only made five threes All Season prior to that one Huntley Hatfield in the lane position in basket man good good Patience by Huntley Hatfield was able to back down Johnson no one came was able to dislodge him and get that nice little tear drop right the rim so the lead is eight it has been as little as three 5653 with 907 to go in this half Miami cut that lead to three and the Miss from Cleveland 10point halftime lead NC State a couple options here obviously you want to go to dant styles styles quick double McNeil hesitation and drive knocked away ston McCrae goes up ahead twoonone chance Schwartz steps behind the line looking for three I thought the Schwarz had Matthew Cleveland last time he put his head down to make sure hes behind the three you had a little one option now you get nothing NC State ball you see the frustration Bill Courtney watch this last play you see Miami does a good job of being able to come up with it now I see oh excuse me thats the last play off Hunley Hatfield so that was off of Miami Brian so it is NC State ball coach Courtney watching from the sideline as the interim head coach for Miami in his 29th season as a Collegiate basketball coach he watches his team produce a turnover Cleveland I dont think hes giving this one up and thats one of the things that makes him so good is that with his height and athleticism that last time he realized he had to M and Michael conell an option to just go over and buy him Cleveland has 29 Points leads all scorers youre thinking about his career high its Music 32 had 29 this week against Georgia Tech and a loss on the road Nick Neil little bit of space thats all he needed Man Nice Shot by mcne I thought he had a clear layup opted to go ahead and raise the degree of difficulty Little P wet to knock that one down so the lead is eight inside of three and a half minutes to go in regulation from watsco sener Coral Gable Florida we go chuku driving and scoring nice move by UK chuku that last time no one stopped him he was able to get downhill and again with his height and length did a good job of being able to finish I mean fending off the defender with one arm and scoring with the other highly skilled move as much as as much weve seen NC State looked like they were going to run away with this thing Miami still keeping it close Hill dumps it into the corner oconnell too much on it middle Brooks playing with four personal fouls Styles head of theme Misses Johnson the rebound Cleveland 43 bam what a read by ugu chuku that last time understand you get the ball formance today dont tell these guys that its the last day of the regular season and theyre not going to the tournament cuz they are playing lights out right now and you talked about the fact that you know the end of the season I mean you want to make sure that you have fond memories and both teams have come out especially in the second half have turned the energy to another level Kane celebrating their seniors prior to the game we salute all the seniors on all the rosters in the ACC on this final day of the regular season next week we are in Charlotte for the tournament this year the expanded numbers in the conference only 15 go just 220 to go in regulation right down to the wire mcneel Loops it in Middlebrooks Styles kicked it out of bounds good defensive possession from Miami again took away the first two options for NC State and seemed that thats one of the things that has led to them shooting better from the field right now important possession for Miami kans closed at the 5653 with about 9 minutes to go in this half the trail by three now can tie with a threepointer methodical possession Sten McCrae to T us up at 70 and great rotate great recognition by St McCay realized that two went on the dive Johnson you leave him wide open now Miami tied this game back up just a little under two minutes ago have not been tied since it was 22 early stages of this Applause game shot clocked down hill all the way Hill comes up short kanes with a chance to go ahead here in Miami obviously you look at for Matthew Cleveland to make sure you maintain your spacing Miami Last LED when it was two to one final minute of regulation of the shot clocks inside of 10 for Cleveland mcneel has the rebound oconnell Kevin Keat signals to oconnell com near me and call a timeout with 466 seconds to go the second half of this game up near 58 Applause shooting tied at 70 40 seconds to go in the game o Music Connell Styles in his 24 points shot clock its six on the spin he got doubled and find o Connell trying to get to the rim Cleveland knocks it away and out of bounds and that is going to be well the official was about to Signal shot clock violation and the clock reads double zeros but they are going to look at it Cleveland made the defensive play knocked it out of bounds and remember Brian the clock does not stop until something the ball hits something out of bounds right and watched his last play and I thought that you see watch the play here and the block by Cleveland seem like there may be there might be a little maybe like a three as you see good play it should stop now so when the ball hits something out of bounds thats when the clock stops and that last play and watch the block by Cleveland ball goes out of bounds and youre talking Georgia take math man I said three Tom come on I told you Im ni with it well and why is that critical right because thats enough time technically for the catch shoot if you have a less than three its got to be a tip at The Rim or a tip from somewhere see Im Im going to give you your flowers but keep me mind I call yes I but I expect that from you all the time thats all go to the point where the ball hit out of bound 239 and4 okay they can catch and shoot so you heard the explanation we got it right there from Adam FEG 4 I will even an apology 4 that point three time not you were you were you know 10th of a second away enough time for a catch and shoot yes three or more they got point4 so now that got knocked Away by Johnson and that is a shot clock violation that was an interesting sequence cuz again after he deflects it when does it hit how much time goes off the clock point4 and heres the thing now is that obviously everyone in the arena understands with 235 seconds left to go you go to the man of the hour for Miami and thats Matthew clevand Cleveland you see Courtney Ops Call It Cleveland leads all scorers in this Music Applause game Cleveland has tied his career high which he set against Syracuse at home this season here we go with the final 10 seconds of Regulation tied at 70 Applause Cleveland final shot attempt driving against middle Brooks follow Jam by Johnson with a second left Cleveland missed Johnson slammed it a and what a play because again you were Bill Courtney you made sure that you you put you ran inside of 10 seconds you got downhill by mat Matthew Cleveland then Brandon Johnson comes with the Music putback how about this Miami Hurricane didnt watch this last play coming off the Stagger basically he gets downhill you forc the help by Ben mider Brooks no one boxes out Brandon Johnson he gets a chance to put put the put back in for what ultimately looks like could be the game winner the officials were checking the clock just to see how much time has left after the Brandon Johnson double fisted jam on the follow thats now double digits for him with 10 points but none more important than those two with 13 seconds left on the clock were trying to make sure of that number and good play out of the timeout I said you wanted to give your score an opportunity to get to the strong hand now right now 13 left on the on the clock you want to keep everything in front of you if youre Miami pass on the inbounds to midcourt to Middle Brooks deflected and the Miami Hurricanes win it what a comeback a 10 run over the last 3 minutes and 15 seconds and Miami wins 7270 an amazing comeback by Miami
