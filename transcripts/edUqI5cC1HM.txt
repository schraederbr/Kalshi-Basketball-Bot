this one having lost four in a row while uva has won four straight their sole focus is on this rivalry divine diablo admitted that the last month has been rough for the hokies but he says rivalry week has rejuvenated excited and motivated he and his teammates to reclaim the commonwealth cup especially after how things went down a year ago while brendan armstrongs team has tunnel vision theres no thoughts about potential bowl games all he and his teammates want to do is beat tech on their home field for the first time in 22 years dave kd thank you very much we get it underway virginia won the coin flip they defer to the second half so virginia tech will have the football to get things rolling here tonight their quarterback situation has really been interesting because braxton burmeister will be the man to lead them out tonight he played last week against clemson did not start but he came in when hendon hooker went out of the ball game very unusual circumstances he was freezing he came out of the contest burmeister orchestrated a scoring drive right away lets see what he can do tonight right from jump street and the handoff goes to the lead back right away as herbert gets the carry and 96 yards against clemson and a touchdown in a game they were in tim they had an opportunity in that one very few teams can say that against the tigers it was a one score game with five minutes left in the third and they had the football back gonna air this one out into the flat and a completed pass grant with the coverage on it but thats gonna go for seven yards and complete to trey turner big play trey they like to call him so third down and two virginia tech getting the football on the very first drive here now the last three times that these schools have met its been real close tech holding a slight scoring advantage over the three combined 7470 thats how tight it has been and a handoff over it again hes going to get free in the center of the field and hes breaking away down to the 30 with a little stutter step juice herbert showing it off with a huge carry that goes for 40 yards yeah he does a nice job of just staying front side finding you know being patient finding a hole and then he puts that left foot in the ground and gets vertical you know zone read just a great job of patience vision and then really just taking his first opportunity to get up the field thats a nice job by herbert he is leading fbs in allpurpose yards over 1600 yards thats also number one in the acc and hes averaging over 100 rushing yards per game second most in the atlantic coast conference and rips off a dandy there for 40 to bring up first down and 10 and the hokies on the move and they want him to try and bounce outside here theyre going to string him out so nothing doing on that occasion they saw that coming he does not gain a single inch he doesnt see the energy dave you know this feels like it you know a rivalry game already you see virginia do a good job of stringing this out not allowing herbert to get to the corner just look at the virginia sideline the excitement the energy and i think that both of these teams and head coaches have kind of talked to their players about is it going to feel different than other commonwealth cups weve got to bring our own energy looks like virginia is there one of the reasons for that and this is not overstating it this could very well be the last football game these two teams play tonight this season here in 2020 burmeister keeping on his feet thats something he can do as well braxton burmeister the junior out of la jolla california goes for 18 thats his own read theyre reading benny alonso offense number 77 10 yard penalty check it out oh thats going to come back tackle makes it a little easier yes it does make it easier you see it a lot of times these guys in space here and his you know he just kind of is as matt gam tries to spin out of it i think it just looks like hes grabbing too much jersey i dont know that was a little tough hes gonna go back and now ahead he comes with the football gonna keep it and dive ahead around the 30yard line burmeister with the carry and jordan redmond the nose tackle there with the stop just getting underway here tonight on a nice night in blacksburg temperatures in the middle 50s and overcast skies but no threat of rain tonight so the weather is certainly cooperating third down and 11 coming up here for the hokies thats what i mean about virginia sideline and you called it dave youre getting into this field of like hey we got to bring our own energy like no use saving anything with how this year is gone yep because this might be it maybe not a bowl either for either side and that one is going to be fired incomplete burmeister chased down by noah taylor who out of the gate is already moving as quick as anybody the 65 225 pound junior out of silver springs maryland in pursuit and its important for virginia to have him back hes been in and out of the lineup does have a lot of virginia defenders and so you know having him back especially when you consider you know charles snowden being out certainly helps his virginia defense so for brian jordan this will be 47 yards as that kick is in the air and absolutely perfect for the hokies so they capitalize on the big gain by juice herbert they take a three nothing lead here in the first quarter well number 21 is the early attack plan for the hokies who worked out very well in the scoring drive hes right in the middle of it eight plays 46 yards in just under four minutes and khalil herbert with the number one carry so it is three to nothing virginia tech with the field goal virginia won last years commonwealth cup 3930 at charlottesville they recovered a hokey fumble in the end zone with about a minute left to play to secure that win we take a look now at tonights player spotlight brought to you by geico the quarterback for virginia brennan armstrong he has been one of the best dual threat quarterbacks in america since he came back from the nc state game tim that you talked about that games with over 200 yards passing and at least 45 yards rushing hes got six of them hes the only one in fbs thats done that and hes missed games you know hes just a really gritty tough football player thats been productive and bronco mendenhall you know saw this coming and theyre going to be patient with him as well as he kind of grows as a passer lefthander very good very good that way it could be oh so dangerous on the very first carry he picks up eight yards right away hes especially good on third downs on the third down conversions in fact hes been spectacular 14 of those and many times hes done it with the legs second down and two for virginia they come in at five and four riding a fourgame winning streak that has completely turned their season around armstrongs the number one reason for that hes going to fire that one is going to loosen up the football its going to be incomplete out of the hands of billy kemp who has been his number one receiver but connor with a big hit its a really nice play and another you know excited sideline there you know for virginia tech and the ball thrown a little bit behind by brennan armstrong there leads to a third down so third and two for the quarterback out of shelby ohio hes going to carry that and hes going to be straightened up by diablo divine diablo is wearing the number 25 tonight thats a really nice honor the frank bieber number and thatll gain three and pick up a first hes such a weapon in the short yard of stuff looks like a quarterback sneak you know hes kind of you know walks up there takes the snap from under center but how about the field dave you know usually right in between the center and the guards but that wasnt there and so hes just kind of able to get out to the perimeter and pick up the first thompson will take the handoff keeton thompson will dive ahead as we toss it down to the field and katie george well guys brendan armstrong often thinks back to that period where he was sidelined because of the concussion against nc state he says those two weeks of recovery allowed him to reset and almost restart the season and after he returned hes performed extremely well he said he wanted to do a better job of taking care of the football not forcing it and extending drives with his feet and hes playing his best football right now opens up a bit for kemp after the reception who has now caught 59 footballs this season and this one will be ripped off for 14 yards yeah its its kind of an interesting play here they got to tackle ryan nelson out in space trying to block basically just gets in the way of shamari connor and that allows billy kept to get up the field but unique formation there out of robert and i offensive coordinator for virginia the young man throwing the block number 81 the wide receiver is the freshman lavelle davis 67 and he can flat run he is a superstar in the making armstrong is going to step up again as that play broke down but hell be taken down to bring up the second down after he gains three on the run you know and dave whats interesting is this play does break down its a designed pass the linemen arent getting down field but this is a a broken down play if you will as you described it which is correct and you know its brendan armstrong still finding a way to to get positive yards look three yards on a first down run youll take that and theyre happy with it and its one of the things their quarterback does really well well hes got kitan thompson lining up with him hes been a fascinating story this season hes going to get the football again no place to go is that closed up very quickly on thompson but hes the guy who can be a wide receiver running back hes even been a quarterback this season loses a yard on this play however yeah hes basically been cordell stewart slash for ketone you know for this virginia office they have they played him at quarterback they use him as a receiver and you know he helps them basically you know do unique things formationally that that really challenge your defense he lined up as a wide receiver now he just motioned into the backfield so he can be very very confusing for a defense he flares out pass over the middle and that will be to the tight end tony poljan one of the better tight ends in a loaded tight end conference the accs caught five touchdown passes that goes for 10 yards its ketone thompson who runs the wide route from the backfield who who opens up tony poljan and youre right hes been another nice grad transfer find for this virginia offense throughout this season and been really productive they like his kind of humble confidence on this football team hes gonna roll and fire down field looking for the end zone but overthrown that was intended for lavell davis who has become one of the more dangerous targets even though he doesnt get many thrown his way in all of the conference yeah this is the previous play you see keaton thompson kind of stretched the defense that gets pulled jan open and you know and you see you kind of get this combo of six seven pole jan you got thompson whos you know every bit of six four and then you get lavelle davis who they take a shot to at six foot seven three wide out stacked to the left for armstrong hes gonna look the other way however he fires an incomplete one at his tight end again but hes well covered intended for pogen so third down and ten coming up justin fuente virginia tech head coach told us that he thought the hokies would have one of the best secondaries in college football this season that has not happened nothing close to that in fact virginia tech was touched up by bcs backup quarterback roselle for over 500 yards and four touchdowns armstrong looking to fire again and complete to kemp and kemp will dive ahead billy kemp with another reception and a 13yard pickup stopped by ashby yeah this you know he goes back to justin quinte say basically five defensive back starters that were anticipated to start the season hes down to two you know caleb farley ops out youve had injuries and so yeah its been a little bit of a struggle throughout the season in the secondary for virginia tech now thats been a bit of a challenge i think just mentally and emotionally for justin fuente more first downs already on this drive theyll stay on the ground and you know one thing virginias done really well tim you and i have had a bunch of their games they have had a lot of drives that have gone for a lot of minutes on the clock for example theyve had four different drives that have gone over 90 yards and have all wound up as a touchdown this season yeah i think its a good its a mark of a disciplined team to to be able to sustain drives the way they have this season and do it again once again its kemp the target and a little bit of chitchat in this rivalry game covered by strong and they went back and forth a little bit dorian strong but an eightyard game there and again its billy kemp you know he typically does most of his work inside kind of a slot receiver pretty shifty does a good job of feeling zones and sitting down in them but hes been pretty productive you know outside as well coming into tonight with 58 he really has has been a nice kind of addition to their offense and im not sure they knew that that he would be able to contribute in this way to the start of the season so penalty there but good balance here seven passes six runs on this drive for armstrong and virginia firing for the end zone and a touchdown caught by thompson well thats just an amazing weapon they have and keaton thompson an 11 bullet for a touchdown for virginia again theyre moving them all around this time hes lined up outside you know as a receiver and you know armani chapman just lets him get inside and it five foot eleven chapman once you know has no chop once keaton thompson gets his body inside and thats what i mean about slash for keaton thompson so another touchdown for him and hes caught a few of them hes rushed for a few of them he can pass for a touchdown as well 73 virginia on top early so this is meeting number 102 but its the first time its ever been played in the month of december as mentioned last season came right down to the final minute of play and it still stings virginia tech that virginia pulled that one out tim was a hugely meaningful victory for the cavaliers over and above the rivalry win it certainly was and it it does feel right to have this at the end of the season doesnt it i mean it just like i get it november december its been rescheduled multiple times but you know there there is something nice about this one being played at the end of the regular season schedule obviously theres some uncertainty beyond this but i think the players and we got the sense of that you know just hearing from bro both programs about the excitement and the how meaningful this game is to both programs both head coaches bronco mendenhall and justin fuente talked this week about how proud they are that their teams have fulfilled their schedules every time that they could burn meisters going to air it out here and complete got that one outside to james mitchell youre talking about one of the great tight ends in the country really out of mountain gap virginia a guy who can run it too he can also return punts yeah and you just look at the rescheduled nature of this game dave to kind of continue on with our conversation with it i mean its a good kind of glimpse into the challenges of the season you know was it originally scheduled for the 19th its got been moved around and i think these players are thrilled to be playing this game because of what it means and the experience theyve had playing it in the past for many of them oh pretty good stick there by jackson nick jackson the inside linebacker leads this team with 98 tackles yeah hes been their best defensive player this year and boom that is a big time hit in tackle by nick jackson on a running back that very few people get those types of licks on in khalil herbert but yeah nick jackson has had a great great season and you know i think in many ways hes kind of held things together when when other segments of this virginia defense have been struggling yeah next tackle will be his 100th of the season burmeist with pressure gets free of that on the roll to his right getting the pass away did a really fine job just getting it away but a completion to turner thats gonna go for four yeah and really joey blunt is a free runner here joey blunt should have a free run at braxton burnmeister its a great job of escaping and then its a really good job in terms of the accuracy of the throw running to his right throwing the ball away from the defender and you know joey blunts another player for virginia hes been in and out of the lineup and hes a very good player but its tough i dont care how good you are its tough when you miss time because of injury or otherwise and youre going to all of a sudden catch up to the speed of the game thats a major reason virginia is allowing just a ton of passing yards and its going to be thrown right into the turf incomplete to bring up second down and as braxton burmeister gets the start at quarterback out of southern california and yes he is an avid surfer southern california long way from blacksburg but he said look i have family in virginia i didnt feel like you know i was going someplace too far away from home it didnt strike me that way i had a lot of family members in virginia to rally around me but he did light up a little bit when you talk to him about surfing yes which obviously i know so much about going to be completed right there on the sideline you know as robinson makes the catch one thing about braxton about five or six weeks ago a very large offensive lineman stepped on his foot 380 pounds and broke three of his toes so hes been playing with that all season long because those take a while to heal and thats brutal and really his game is speed i mean you know anybody will tell you hes a very good runner because hes fast and hes you know they get explosive plays with him and you know i think hes clearly feeling better you know which should show itself in the quarterback run game gets back in the waves hes going to be hanging seven initially heres holston on the carry as he dives straight ahead and gains four so the ground attack has been very good early here for the hokies virginia on top 73 late in the first quarter in a commonwealth cup game between these two rivals virginias victory last year in this game ended the hokies 15game winning streak no room to operate there for herbert as he goes sliding down 15 in a row in that streak that came to an end in charlottesville lacc womens troops coming away on sunday clemson taking on pitt thats it noon and then the number four team in the country nc state to take on tims alma mater boston college at 2 pm those games right here on acc network great to have you with us tonight players keeping their energy up on the virginia and the hokies benches third down and five and complete to robinson as he takes the hit gonna pick up at first though nick grant there for the coverage this is a good job by burmeister just throwing on time just a simple hitch by tavion robinson the balls a little high but because of the depth of the route you know they grant forward progress and give them a first down but thrown on time critical in those situations and it would not be surprised seeing the way that nick grant drove on that route there to see virginia tech double move later or do something to kind of test this virginia secondary thats really struggled this season jalen holston a running back out of the shotgun now hes going to roll again looking downfield time to throw puts it in the air but incomplete thrown out of bounds to bring up the second down for the hokies we talked about both head coaches being very proud of the fact that theyve played so many games but theres no question and a flag down here theyre moving in opposite directions the hokies a fourgame skid so just 54 seconds left in the first quarter referee riley johnson theres no foul for an eligible receiver downfield all right so its just second down and you know virginia techs been a team on a spiral ever since that controversial loss with one second left to liberty way back on november seventh when fuente blamed himself for an illtime timeout its been an exhausting season for both programs but you could really feel the weight of it with cobin 19 in particular vermice is going to wind up and fire way downfield deep and nearly intercepted in the end zone nick grant there on coverage again intended for trey turner intended for trey turner nick grant does a nice job of kind of squeezing the post of trey turner trick turners running to the post but watch nick grant kind of squeeze him try to flatten him off as much as possible and you know that doesnt allow turner to stay vertical and maybe make a play in the football and thats a pretty good job by nick grant and really so far by this virginia secondary that you know as i said just you know hasnt played as well as i think many people thought they would play especially with so much experience in their secondary oakies have been pretty good here in the first quarter on third down three for four trying to keep the drive rolling here once again burmeister on the move to fire and its complete to hajj changa hodge with the catch thats an 11yard gain its a pretty good job here by burmeister again he must have worked to his left but matt guyan runs underneath the route so as he escapes to the right just does a good job of finding change on the sideline and the villanova transfer he was able to get enough yards to to pick up a first down and extend this drive and you also get a sense of burmeister his athleticism and really how he wants to escape outside the pocket yup even on maybe the bucky foot showing no ill effects on that as he picks up another first down theyre going to hand this one off into the center of the line breaking free holston busted a tackle or two before they took him down grant and king if you raise it up and you let the other guy know they got to wait a year to win it back its also precovered david no ones sharing that of cups that just looked really just looked weird saying that like you cant do that anymore no therell be some things we got to get used to yes for a little while anyway the vaccines on the way lets hope that thats one of the things that returns in full force the stopped by mandy alonso on a carry by holston kind of interesting that jalen holston is getting all of these carries now and not herbert even though he came firing out of the gate tonight and you know we had that big collision with nick jackson we did see him since that point has had a carry from that point but it is um you know not typical that that we would see holston this much this early third down and one looking for another first down but a lot of those in the early going and to carry by holston picks it up yeah we just go back this was the collision and you know it was a big collision obviously you know nick jackson was the hammer and julio herbert was the nail but hes got his helmet on looks like hes ready to reenter the game it is something to note seeing holston this much early on in the game just underway second quarter 73 virginia holston has to cut back to his left before he is stopped on the play Applause and a flag thrown here personal foul face mass defense number 95 penalty is half the distance to the goal line and an automatic first half monterey with the personal foul the face mask so the first penalty really hurts either side as virginia tech tries to drive for the end zone this drive has lasted almost seven minutes on the run and it is herbert to get the football again so getting back into the groove gam with the tackle but it picks up five and its good to see him back in for virginia tech offensively and you know you just look at this dave you talk about these drives i mean the the commitment to running the football and chipping away has been good you also i think back to a couple of those third down completions by braxton burmeister this has been a pretty good answer so far by this virginia tech offense no question about it going to be another hand up this one for turner turner the white out going ahead into the end zone he stayed on his feet and he gets in for the touchdown some of the versatility for the hokies as the wideout gets in on the carry well theyve been pounding the football straight ahead and then how about the jets reap with khalil herbert out in front to kind of escort trey turner to the perimeter and you know nice job of play calling nice job of switching it up by virginia tech and thats an impressive drive you know after the ketone thompson touchdown reception to get the football back and march it down the field the way they did thats a great response by the hokies and the extra point is good youre right a mighty impressive drive to him 17 plays but a touchdown in the lead clemson and virginia tech then at 8 30 its georgia tech and fsu florida state absolutely loaded thats tuesday on acc network thats scoring drive 17 plays great balance nine runs and eight passes tim thats a great drive and really their first one without the holding penalty on darasaw could have been similar so 12 53 to go into second good one underway 107 hokies and notre dame chalk talks virtual fan experiences and more the hub launch is monday its accessible from the acc mobile app or acchamphubcom so virginia staying on the ground here with the quarterback armstrong on first down hell gain six as virginia tech has jumped in the lead 10 to seven what a scoring performance by north carolina today against miami they blew the doors off the hurricane 6226 and man did they do it on the ground michael carter 308 yards devonte williams 236 yards and a tremendous defensive play that one batted down as the pass was intended for henry connor with a great diving play yeah that ball is again a little bit inside you want to miss outside on outbreaking routes and brennan armstrong doesnt do that and it is a nice break on the football of chamari connor really ive been impressed with the way that both secondaries so far have you know kind of made plays on the football been aggressive with how theyve attacked things thats a nice job there by connor armstrong has been perfect on third down so far tonight hes gonna run with the football here staying on his feet gonna be real close just to design qb draw with grant mitch as the lead blocker the tight end getting into the backfield and really gonna come down to the spot here so fourth down and one and armstrong stepping off and theyre going to have to punt away nash griffin on for virginia Applause virginia tech has won 19 of the last 21 games in this series and they have virginia at home here tonight and to punt that one short and its loose and virginia has it on special teams they force the turnover as the punt is muffed and it was james mitchell who had trouble with it and stewart came up with it and field of punts been a big issue for virginia tech theyve got the 242 pound tight end you know fielding this punt he did it a week ago and did a pretty good job of it but you know just misjudges that one you know i think a more experienced returner probably you know when he when he realizes hes not going to feel it cleanly can get out of the way and that guys a really good football player thats a tough spot to be in it really puts in a tough spot as you know very well the hokies are the ones known for tremendous special teams play faking a run here and armstrong will go down as he takes the hit and will gain three yards stopped by diablo and dave thats a great point i mean this program you know in the reputation of special teams and frank beamer and the history of great players that have played on special teams at virginia taking the buyin that you get uh you know from players playing on special teams and this shows you the challenges this season with injuries things of that nature that where you have a tight end you know returning punts for you devon taylor the corner coming up and he makes the stop there they certainly werent fooled on that one it does it does not merit a single inch on the carry Applause virginia tech with a 107 lead and armstrong trying to pull off another conversion here on third and seven the lefthander will throw over the middle and incomplete intended for thompson again hes complaining he thought a flag should have been thrown there but it was not good coverage by armani chapman chapman does a good job they roll the coverage virginia tech does what watch you know then the orange jersey there connor he rotates over the top probably gets a little bit of a ketone thompson and you know but not enough to draw a flag thats a good job of disguising coverage rolling to it and actually a pretty good job of seeing it by brendan armstrong thats well played by the virginia tech defense big stand brian delaney on 39 yards for the field goal attempt and its no good so they fail to capitalize on the turnover on special teams virginia tech on top by three in the second quarter any completions to keep the drive alive and then they hit the jet sweep for the score to trey turner i think it was a real wellcalled drive you know in terms of play calls wellexecuted drive and its a nice job by the virginia tech offense and then a really great job by their defense after the james mitchell fumbled punt well they took over on the virginia tech 24 and could not score burmeister to roll and fire and a completion out to nick gallo the number two tight end they have two very good ones lets toss it down to katie george well guys after the muff punt james mitchell was sworn by teammates telling him to shake it off keep his head up justin fuente told him the same and mitchell has practiced returning punts all season just in case he needed to step in because somebody tested positive or was contact traced for cobia 19 hes a competitive resilient kid and i can confirm he had a smile across his face as that field goal went wide ill bet he did hes a very very popular player on this team theres no question about that so hes a rallying point for virginia tech they stay on the ground for herbert starting to get back into the flow again but no gain yeah and just to kind of finish up on james mitchell its a thats almost an impossible situation to be in you know i mean its not his designed position or any of that and to kind of give a sense of of what teams deal with braxton burmeister even took reps you know practicing returning punts and its just something that you probably have to do no different than making sure you have a long snapper which was also an issue at one point in the season for virginia tech and so um you know its one of the things i think you know is for the reason of frustration this season for what teams are faced with burmeister has an open man hes gonna get that one free its mitchell as he will tiptoe out of bounds pushed out by cohen king but how about coming back for 38 yards on this reception yeah big time he just leaks out to the corner in a move the pocket play here as burn meister you know moves to his right and thats a great job and probably more in line with what james mitchell is comfortable doing great play there by the big tight end the third highest rated tight end in the class of 2021 says mel kiper so they probably wont talk a whole lot about punt returns you didnt play with many guys 63 240 who returned punts i know you didnt as herbert tries to bounce outside hes dragged out yeah and listen to not many guys that that run routes and are willing blockers and just all around great tight ends the way that james mitchell is as well and so yeah itll be interesting to see what his future is uh whether its you know in the nfl next year or sometime after that but he does have a bright future at the position hes a junior and of course this season does not count against any players eligibility second down and eight herbert again in the backfield Applause and the handoff here for hodge and hodge not going very far as virginia gets to him and thats joey blount you talked about earlier you know hes had a very tough season nicked up but looking healthy tonight yeah and look how aggressive he decides to fill right here thats a great job by joey blunt you can see why you know they missed him you know see it trust it you know and go attack and play down hill and listen i i think with some of the injuries that theyve had its just its good to see him back hes a really good football player i think he was fighting through injuries early on in the season and its a big play there on second down Applause a key call here third down and 10 trying to keep the drive alive for the hokies out of the gun burmeister flushed out hes going to fire that one out of bounds into the virginia bench a lot of pressure there that was blood again as he was giving chase and they decided to bring him you know thats one of the things i think that makes him a unique player hes a very good blitzer you know he finds himself at times as a half field defender you know or middle of the field safety virginia is pretty versatile in terms of where they line guys up but i think hes also a really good blitzer and does a nice job coming off the edge there he saw him earlier also so this will be a 47yard attempt on a field goal by brian johnson hit a 54yarder against clemson gets this one in the air and it is good he drills it from 47 so the hokies on the board again leading 13 to 7 coaches and players and look were at this point i think its been surprising to a lot of people but theres been a lot of football played and i think that its probably the right perspective to take at this point with the way that the teams have been able to be available to play each and every weekend i think the bull situation could be entirely different obviously schools are beginning to opt out of consideration for bulls boston college and pitt just in the conference this week a couple who have done that i dont think theyre going to be the last ones to do that first down 10 for armstrong gonna flare that one out and incomplete Applause and intended for simpson coming out of the backfield you know one thing you have to remember and i think a lot of the coaches are beginning to talk about this tim pretty candidly their players have been on campus for months unable to see their families they were not allowed to go for thanksgiving and return to their homes to see their parents to see their loved ones its on the handoff staying on his feet gets a nice carry so at this point you know youre talking about kids whove been on campus players back to july right and unable to get home yeah i think thats the big thing dave i mean you nailed it many of these players they enjoy having their family come and watch them play a game you know many instances they havent been able to do that and you know and then you take thanksgiving maybe not able to see your family because of you know campus rules school rules in terms of you know what happens if you leave campus so yeah i think that its an unusual situation to be in i think you know many times youre dying to go to a bowl game and have that experience but to see the decision made by boston college and pitt and as you said probably some others in the future i think many of them are doing it because of the sacrifice theyve seen their players already make and they maybe see that as enough now simpson becoming a featured performer here hes in motion for the cavaliers armstrong is going to fire again and thatll be complete as he gets that pass out to janna for a fouryard game i think a lot of the coaches are just just talking like human beings they want to make sure that their kids are happy that their players get a chance to see their families the bowl experiences are very different now this particular year at least you know for this window that were in the age of the pandemic a lot of the the time at the bowl sites has been shrunk to just a couple of days youre not going to get an opportunity to get out and see a lot of the sights and participate with your teammates in those great events that make the bulls so attractive so its going to be very interesting to see how it plays out a diving effort but that one incomplete intended for davis the 67 freshman could not make the play damn brandon armstrong hands him hes running a slam hes looking for him in that second window after he passes devin taylor and hes open and i think brennan armstrong just needs to give him a better ball and he probably can keep him up and devel davis probably run afterwards so you know a third down opportunity there missed by virginia and brennan armstrong so 4 41 to go here before halftime and once again its going to be mitchell back for the punt as griffin gets it off this one very shorthanded by mitchell as he will go down and thats where the drive will begin for virginia tech theyre already up 13 ill get the latest news great information from the acc each morning with special guests from the world of sports its packer in durham weekdays at 7 00 am eastern on the acc network and the espn app acc network football from lane stadium here in blacksburg commonwealth cup virginia and virginia tech hokies on the move here dave obriens in hasselbeck from our homes katie george live and there goes herbert up the middle and theyre going to catch him to the 40 the 30 breaking away Applause Music Applause thats a great run and we see the speed but its the job of the guys up front im not sure hes even touched does a good job of stretching it press the hole you know moving to his left and then just get vertical and at that point its the speed and i think this is the thing that really has probably been the biggest surprise with him this season is how much speed he actually has thats a great job of the guys up front but thats a lot of speed out of khalil herbert you know we hadnt seen a lot of big plays we had we had you know kind of sustained drives big one there you know he took an early hit from jackson but he knows how to hit back like to the tune of 76 yards here yeah thats quite a counter punch dave youre exactly right and its excellent by the guys up front because this isnt down in one hand touch and its good job of him setting up his blockers working with them as they are moving to their left with that zone run scheme and thats a nice job 16th rush of over 20 yards this season and you know you get big plays out of the run game it means theres a lot of people contributing you youve got receivers blocking downfield obviously the guys up front doing a good job but usually its because youve got a really talented back and he most certainly is that virginia tech with their longest play of the season i should say so 76 yards the rumble by herbert to put the hokies on top 207 so the cavaliers in a little bit of a state of shock as the hokies taking hold of this one and on the short kick it goes out and theyll toss the flag there virginia very hot team coming in at the 35 yard line first out so by rule they go to the 35yard line to place the football virginia with a fourgame winning streak but at the moment the hokies of the team looking like they are the one on the roll even though they have dropped four consecutive games dont forget at one point fairly early in the season virginia tech was a top 20 team they had a 42 record and they were ranked in the top 20 armstrong trying to lead the cavaliers back and the reception will be made by janna on the near sideline you have to be out here and you know dave you go back to virginia tech it was interesting to hear justin fuente say we were 20 but just for the record i was still miserable to kind of get a sense of the stresses of this season but youre right you know and i think you know injuries optouts things like that havent helped Applause second down and four and a quick shot and a completed pass to henry sean henry his first four catches of the season all went for touchdowns one of the more unusual statistics in the acc this year he picks up a first down the southpaw will run ahead once again get some rushing skills got close to the 50yard line hell pick up three and you talk about you know the stress on a head coach not knowing every saturday morning if youre going to be able to play when you wake up in the morning on top of that for fuente he personally has been covet tested 40 times this season thats just incredible yeah i think its its good for people to know that the sacrifice and the anxiety and the stress that goes along with making this happen and you know commitment from the coaching staff universities players everybody alike im starting to keep it again and he goes down after pick up at three yards and stop by hewitt jarrod hewitt the nose tackle the senior says that that lost to virginia last year he said its been eating at us all year long it came down to the last play and they outmatched us so far tonight its been the other way around in the hokeys favor and tala papa into the running back but armstrong wants to dump it over the middle and broken up with some authority by diablo he put a hit on thompson and knocked him off his feet devon diablo win frank beamers 25 does its a good job of just driving on this football to throw to keaton thompson also does a great job of you know with the targeting rules the way they are taking his head out of it leading with his shoulder into the body of ketone thompson and i think hes their best defensive player and does an excellent job right there now proudly wearing frank beamer is number 25 for the fifth time in his career quite an honor and forcing the punt back once again mitchell for the fair catch this time so another drive to get underway in time to do some damage here for burmeister and the hokies on top 20 to seven with 2 24 to go before the break and with that kind of time you know you would think especially with some of the success in the run game that all the time outs available pretty good situation for virginia tech to be in here you know be aggressive but you dont have to get it all back at once Applause on the pump fake burmeister will let fly into the flat and complete to turner and hes going to be shoved out of bounds as we go down to the field and katie george well hidden hooker may not have gotten the start tonight but hes doing his part on the sidelines guys hes been engaged supportive he talks with burmeister after each drive hes even been in the offensive line meetings talking xs and os with those guys so hes playing a different part tonight but an important one nonetheless after the 15yard gain theyre going to keep on the ground here with herbert you know many tech fans were expressing lots of concern for hendon hooker that the junior quarterback might have been having a seizure last week or some colgate related issue and he was seen shaking uncontrollably in saturdays loss to clemson he started the game but he was replaced after the opening possession by burmeister and hooker had fumbled burmeister had to come out of the game as he took the knock in the third quarter hendon hooker returned only to fumble again and finally they just let him off the field and that was a very very scary situation but it was not an injury it was a scary situation and i think by all accounts they feel like he is healthy and uh and i think they also felt like braxton burmeister with how he has played this year and the opportunities hes been given that that he probably gives the team the best chance to win in this commonwealth cup and i think the guys have in many ways rallied around braxton burmeister Applause takes the hand off shooting through the center of the line again and picks up the first down so when they need the big gain oh say 76 yards with a short yardage they go to number 21 40 seconds before halftime time in the pocket burmeister nice throw there and he got it free to robinson and robinson is free down the sideline into the end zone for a touchdown a late strike here in the first half and its a 60yard play for the hokies yeah this is just good throw by braxton mermeister on time basically has an isolation route to the back side davonte cross just does a horrible job of tackling and tavion robinson whos got a lot of speed hes a big play receiver for virginia tech but you know you know its a combination of good offense and bad defense there and you know pretty representative of some of the struggles weve seen for virginia defensively well that secondary has at times just been miserable to the cavaliers but a big big play for 60 yards and there have been a handful of those here in the first half for the hokies here at home they have raced out to a 27 lead over their rivals here in the commonwealth cup and you just think about how you know this game went after that james mitchell fumble you almost wondered how this team would respond the defense makes a great stand and from that point you know its been big play after big play for the offense and the defense has continued to find ways to get stops touchdowns of 76 and 60 yards for virginia tech here in the first half and they have opened it up with 31 seconds to go here in the second quarter braxton burmeister stepping into that starting role here tonight 164 yards here in the first half with a touchdown in 10 out of 15 27 to 7 lead for the hokies and tim youve played here and youve called this particular stadium and blacksburg the toughest place to play when the fans are in the house it is so i cant imagine what it would be like now theyd be going crazy right now yeah i mean it just fans feel like theyre on top of you the band is right behind the visiting teams bench its loud theyre into it this time of year obviously you know you play them in december you know its cold everything about it is difficult and you know so you know its an advantage that they havent had this season quite honestly im strong to poljan who will step out of bounds a 16yard completion just seconds remaining here in the first half and by the way the 60yard pass play for the hokies their longest pass play of the season armstrong with a short one again to the tight end and trying to go quickly here with 18 seconds left before halftime theyll gain the first down and a clock running to 10 seconds and stops at seven virginia timing 30 second timeout please reset the game clock for 10 seconds virginia will take the time out to reset the clock to 10 seconds but wasting some time there yeah i think there was a little bit of confusion of what they wanted to do and how they were getting lined up to do it and obviously they get a first down and so you know the clock stops you know until its you know kind of spotted and ready to play there but you know this situation with the with having three you know i think that timeout needs to be called immediately you know in this situation dave youre probably looking for you know maybe try to pick up five seven yards something get a little bit closer so you can find yourself in a situation where you know you you dont have to protect as long on a throw to the end zone on a hail mary situation on the next play the football nearly at the 50yard line 10 seconds to go as they reset the clock final moments of the first half virginia tech breaking away on their home field here at lane stadium armstrong first down and 10 Applause still on the move and now hes going to run it out of bounds with a flag down and two seconds left when he stepped out but a flag was tossed offensive holding number 54 10 yard penalty first half and i think understanding these situations right if youre a quarterback here you have 10 seconds left on the clock and you know brent armstrong kind of playing with fire there a little bit holding on to the football letting things develop before running out of bounds then you get a negative play obviously as the offensive line is trying to rally for the quarterback and now it also makes it more difficult to reach the end zone throwing a hail mary and oh by the way you know throwing one from midfield with two six seven you know pass catchers on your football team would give you a shot dump to kemp yep in the open field is going to later look backward here to armstrong loose as he will scoop it up and thats how the first half will come to an end and the hokies with all of that momentum big play touchdowns a 76yard run a 60yard pass and some pushing and shoving and we saw some hard hits too are you going to see that in any college football game but in a rivalry like this virginia looking to go back to back get those wins for the first time since 9798 but first quarter brennan armstrong the lucky lefty to ketan thompson 11 yard touchdown cavaliers up 73 shortlived though second quarter hokies in the red zone braxton burma burmeister got the nod hands it off to trey turner who got the job done six yards hokeys lead 107 more hokies on their own 24yard line whos got the juice now i got the juice now juice herbert yeah takes the handoff khalils no match for that virginia defense thats a foot race and theres a distinct winner 76 yards to the residence hokey 177 just before the half hokies getting greedy burmeister davion robinson some on camera chemistry takes that thing into the end zone thats what got us 277 katie george went today at the break justin its a big game and your team is making big play after big play lets start with the offense what impressed you about the way they started that first half well i think you know we maintained a couple drives when on third down when we werent exactly cavaliers taking on the virginia tech hokies here from blacksburg and as you score all hokies 277 as we get ready for the third quarter tent yeah theres a great response because virginia jumps out you know with a 73 lead but then it was trey turner on the fly sweep and then all of a sudden here came the big plays it was khalil herbert ripping off a 76yard run and then before the half the big completion to tavion robinson on a nice throw from braxton burmeister and you know big plays from this hokey offense is their defense third down many of those some braxton burmeister timely completions you know that really kept things going for him early on in this football game are zaxbys first half stats virginia will have the football and they won the opening coin toss they defer to the second half so the cavaliers about to have it on offense and they need a quick strike behind brennan armstrong he had been so good over the last five games but for him a very pedestrian first half in many respects he did have a passing touchdown 99 yards in the air total for armstrong in the previous five games since coming back from the concussion 1300 passing yards 11 touchdowns he had rushed for almost 400 yards two more touchdowns hokies did a real good job shutting him down for the most part hes going to dart that one to kemp to get the second half underway and a pass play and thatll go for eight yards on the first strike of the second half Applause 277 lets toss it down to katie george well guys bronco said this first possession is critical his offense needs to start moving the ball to generate some momentum defensively he said the two big plays were killer they need to limit explosive plays these next two quarters armstrong eludes one man but not a second man coming up to say hello as armstrong was knocked off his feet barno getting to him chasing him down yeah barno is a good player you see how long he is in the ground that he covers thats one that brennan armstrong you know as you get outside there hes got to throw it away offense number 72 penalties decline third down on ryan swabaldo is the reigning acc offensive lineman of the week last week so on the hold third down and 11 and this is where armstrong has been so good leading up to this game on third and long gonna hand off here the carry by tala papa as he is stacked up and theyre all over him pollard the first man to make contact thats an interesting play call you know third and eleven and i think theres been a couple of times this year on third and long situations where you know theyve been a little more aggressive with their play call and brennan armstrong maybe hasnt made the best decision i think robert or nye you know many respects one wants to take that away from brennan armstrong and so listen running it on third and long punting the football and flipping the field maybe not the worst thing in the world for virginia well fake and gonna try and keep it alive with a pass play here and got the completed pass for a first down and how about the trickery and deceit here by virginia to keep that drive alive on the fake or its great coordination about whats going on because you get a manageable situation to run your fake punt and you know sure enough its its a good job by nash griffin moving to his left making the throw to nick jackson and nick jackson second catch of the season so first down and ten pressure on armstrong he gets it incomplete to the sideline of the hokies intended for billy kemp jamari connor has been really active tonight in more ways than one a lot of conversation here after the play hes been really good this evening he really has hes a pretty good player you know i think some of these guys too just being in this situation the rivalry game as we talked about earlier maybe the last one of the year certainly a lot of chirping going on second down ten and a long pass play and its going to be incomplete trying to get it to the tallest guy on the field of el davis at 67 he can stretch the field in a couple of different ways strong again with the coverage youre talking about the rivalry its the 102nd alltime meeting they have been playing against each other since 1895 but this is the first time in the month of december that they have met because of the postponements due to coven 19 third down and 10 for armstrong another key call for him the lefty slings in its going to be batted down and incomplete a lot of i think pats on a helmet for diablo tonight tim for good reason yeah and thats a good job of diablo you know breaking on the football what was unique there is tony poljan is not even looking for the ball and so brennan armstrong and pole jam just not on the same page because hes trying to sneak it in there quickly and it looked like devine diablo was more on the same page of with brennan armstrong griffin will drive back mitchell hes going to try and take it out of there he gets across the 20 to about 22 but another flag is down 49 yard punt the return of seven so drive begins here for the hokies already ahead 277 over virginia and herbert who may get a lot of action here in the second half gets the first carry on this drive now the key dates coming up college football playoff december 20 is selection show day presented by a t january one the semifinals rose bowl and allstate sugar bowl and then the national championship game presented by a t playoffs second down and eight for the hokies braxton burmeister getting the start at quarterback and hes done a really fine job tonight herbert again nice opening for him as they spring him for a gain of seven stopped by cohen king and third down coming up third and short for the hokies you mentioned burmeister has you know played a nice game so far as obviously khalil herbert has as well these guys up front too you know the offensive line has been seen as the strength of this football team they have depth there i think the guys up front have done a really good job against the virginia front that usually is pretty good at stopping the run third and short hes going to keep that as he goes spinning out of bounds but he picks up a first down burmeister on the carry he is roommates with the center brock hoffman take a look yeah this is a nice job again of having it all blocked up i mean everybody and then that time its khalil herbert nice on selfish play by the running back he leads up on nick jackson and i think brock hoffman and the rest of the group there doing a really nice job and thats why its been such a clean performance out of braxton burmeister well juice herbert will take a breather and jalen holston the senior from stockbridge georgia gets to carry and give him two yards before he meets nick jackson but a big hit early in the game on herbert and of course was just involved in the fake punt moments ago which went for first down for the cavaliers second down and seven and the hokies looking for a long sustained drive and it really put a hurt on the cavaliers looking to bounce outside its holston with room to run as he took to the sideline before he goes into the bench area in an 11yard gain nice run yeah its a nice run its a split zone meaning theyre in a run zone theyre going to bring the tight end across the formations good job of bouncing it and then matt gam just cant make the tackle and you know matt gam filling in for charles snowden and how many times have we seen snowden with those long arms and that reach be able to corral you know a runner trying to to bounce it outside and you know its plays like that where you you know you see the loss as we take a look at charles snowden on the scooter maybe on the scooter but hes into the game you could tell by that stare burmeister back to throw again airs it out a tremendous catch outstanding play by james mitchell with a onehanded grab as he picks up her first down play action they leak him out kind of wheel them up the sideline and james mitchell thats really good good job for the tight end whos done a nice job in the run game this evening good job making a play on a football there that was probably thrown a little bit further than burn meister intended to throw it yeah so when you slightly overthrow one but a guy makes a catch like that kind of bail you out what do you tell him when he comes back to the huddle usually something like i love you thank you Laughter look for my christmas card that went for 23 and that time virginia saw the play developing and it goes absolutely nowhere as robinson gets tangled up for a loss of seven yeah thats a good job and you know were talking about snowden looking him and youre right during these challenging times espn and the v foundations fight against cancer has not stopped if youre able please support cancer research by visiting vorg donate 100 of what you give goes to cancer research second down 17 and herbert with the carry loses the helmet hanging on to the football game with the stop so herbert is going to have to take a play off 809 to go here in the first its gonna find it there in the pile you know normally when you lose it its right there next to you hes got like i know i have to go out but im gonna need my helmet uh you know to put it back on to come back in so brings up third down holston will replace herbert at the running back for the hokies who lead it 277 burmeister has an opening hes going to take advantage across the 30 and hell get eight of those back chased out by elijah gaines and the hokies trying to snap a fourgame losing skid and pick up their fifth win of the season trying to end virginias fourgame winning streak here in this rivalry matchup so brian johnson on hes become the first hokey kicker to nail three or more from 50 yards in a single season this 47 yards and its good and hes hit two of those in this game now wearing a team jacket underneath his right arm is in his sling and he is without his helmet a usual indicator of being out for the game he will not return which is a big offensive loss but for uva is in so many ways tim because they get so creative with him thats the point dave they do get creative with him they obviously use them a number of ways as a receiver as a runner and even as a thrower at times its interesting he did have a shoulder kind of issue as he was competing for the quarterback job you know early in training camp and you know with it being his right shoulder thats injured a flag down here as it gets a little bit chippy once again on a return by shane simpson but a flag is tossed close to the 30yard line after the return on the kickoff seven the hokies with 704 to go here in the third in a game it was expected to be really nip and tuck very close well take a close look here we talk about a rivalry game this is not uncommon as they piled on lets see what the call is after the play was over unsportsmanlike cotton dug number 45 on the kicking team that is number 45s first unsportsmanlike foul of the half of the game 15 yards penalty first out so ty eller for the unsportsmanlike to draw that penalty so just over seven minutes to go here in the third and virginia needs something good to happen in a hurry pass dump to kemp kemp getting behind a blocker back to the open field hes taken down from behind and another flag down Applause so kemp with a nice gain but a flag is thrown again offense number 69 10 yard penalty first out chris glazer with the hole the six four 305 pounds senior i initially didnt see it they run a little wide receiver screen it seems like blazer isnt real happy with it but they run a wide receiver screen and initially looked like it was pretty well blocked by everybody including the receiver to that side and billy camp was able to pick up you know some pretty good yardage but basically the officials saw it differently backed up to the 40 kemp in motion on first down and 13 pass to pogen and as he gets knocked down by diablo after his sevenyard pickup divine diablo when hes around you are going to know it he is going to put a lick on you he certainly is and those who plays the football well hes a really complete football player defends the pass well a nice pick on trevor lawrence a week ago and hes certainly come up with some big hits tonight hes also a very engaging young man weve enjoyed talking with him a couple of times weve been able to cover the hokies on the run heres simpson and a very determined run he takes some men with him and just kept on moving those legs for a pickup of 11 yards for virginia this is big for virginia obviously because of the score but i just get a little momentum going to feel like theres some hope theres some life and you know coming up with you know a play like that right there by saying shane simpson where you have a nice finish oftentimes can do it Applause armstrong being chased again oh he evades a tackler he got free and hes going to fire that one out of bounds that could have gone for a big big loss however lets get the sense of how you know hes hard to get down hes pretty good pursuit thats you know noral pollard about 270 pounds you know on the shoulders of brandon armstrong you see his strength being able to shake him off and escape follower to six footer 265 pounds giving chase second and ten gonna be fired low and incomplete he wanted kemp again but he was covered by two men and jamari connor once again in the frame as he has been most of the time tonight for the hokies he certainly has if you think about this defense for virginia tech two of their better players shamara connor and devon diablo theyre inside i think if youre virginia youve got to give some opportunities to lavell davis down at the bottom of your screen six foot seven give him an opportunity on one of these smaller corners to go fight for the football yeah they need an electrifying play and bronco pretty much said that to katie kemp is going to break free pick up a couple of extra yards after the catch billy kemp far and away virginias number one target not in the end zone hes only caught one touchdown but plays like this to get them toward the end zone it goes for 18 yeah and certainly nothing against billy kemp to your point dave hes been great for them but lavell davis has got five touchdowns you know so youre looking for a big play find your way into the end zone well there he is yeah he goes diving into the end zone poljan is going to pick up the touchdown 23 yards so theres the big play they needed from armstrong he gets it to pole jan for six yeah they did need it polgen is just coming across the formation there you see from the bottom of the screen good job anticipating and i think virginia tech just kind of loses him hes kind of crossing the field there and what i mean a little bit just a little something to get you going and now theyre probably going for two they line up with a twopoint conversion 3013 armstrong throws short and it is two points and a completed pass to janna so they convert that a twopoint conversion for the cavaliers so they do pick up some momentum they do they just run janna in the wake of lavell daviss release and you only need to pick up a couple yards for that twopoint conversion so its good timing and anticipation by brennan armstrong and this is still down 15 but its got to feel like theres a little life left in here with you know a lot of football still left to be played down just two scores well thats where the cup is right now and charlottesville the commonwealth cup but this drive gives virginia some hope seven plays 57 yards two minutes and 14 seconds so nearly five minutes to go here in the third all sorts of time armstrong taking command a fine pass there to pole jan for 23 yards and then they make good on the twopoint conversion so justin dunkle to kick off and a touch back 30 to 15 virginia tech and lets toss it down to katie george well guys unfortunately virginia cornerback davonte cross was in the medical tent for much of the third quarter he finally exited and limped his way all the way to uvas locker room for further evaluation tim how does this affect uva secondary well listen theyve already been thin theyve you know kind of dealt with injuries and rotated guys around candidly cross has not played well we saw a missed tackle earlier i think they just need to really get home find ways to put pressure on burn meister i think thats whats going to give them their best chance for success twoyard gain for herbert there now keep in mind virginia tech has had plenty of key players missed games on the defensive side as well and theyve paid for it and backtoback losses to pitt and clemson theyve been badly outscored in the second half 24 to nothing by pittsburgh and a 28nothing run by the clemson tigers and then just another factor to kind of give hope to this virginia team pass completed here on the near side to robinson davian robinson ripped off a long 60yard touchdown reception in the first half longest pass play of the year for the hokies first down and 10 coming up now for virginia tech and virginia tech there you know trying elijah gaines the true freshman whos now in for devonte cross you know 38 down at the bottom of your screen and you know i wouldnt be surprised to see tavion robinson or trey turner you know find a way to match up and and see what he has vermeis did a run again and lob this one out of bounds nothing there for him now the second half scoring for virginia tech youre talking about losses in every single instance here the liberty miami pin and the tigers we talked about all the points theyve given up tim in the second half of games down the stretch yeah thats something the team has to know i feel right theyve lifted it and so you know look its probably something that both coaches have talked to their teams about im sure that bronco you know has kind of mentioned it at halftime and im sure that justin fuente has talked to his team about being able to finish they find themselves here in a meaningful game trying to do just that monster firing to the flat but what coverage by virginia you talk about the game that nick grant has had so far they lose three yards on this play yeah its just a kind of a wide receiver bubble to black sheer and you know tavion robinson doesnt block on the perimeter you know its essentially a screen and so you get a block downfield its almost like a sweep basically and if you dont get perimeter blocking bad things can happen thats a nice job by nick grant just seeing it and firing third down and 12 burn meister out of the pocket slings back to the sideline and lets see where they put that football on the completion as gaines was there for the coverage its going to be very close well its gaines you know theyre trying him into the boundary and its a well thrown ball hes not deep enough on the route and thats just short of the first down well the crowd such as it is urging the hokies to go for it here on fourth and one Applause and as the clock runs inside 220 here in the third and gonna go ahead and punt and a fair catch signal inside the 15yard line since when the drive will begin here for the cavaliers our womens basketball doubleheader comes your way tomorrow on acc network in the espn app we start in pittsburgh with two in one the panthers hosting clemson at noon and then number four nc state will take on boston college flag on the play and first and ten coming up here virginia trailing 30 to 15 the false start but the cavaliers to take over here at the 19yard line for armstrong hes going to run and throw kind of a wobbly toss but its completed he got it to davis for the first down 28 yards its a great play by brennan armstrong hes escaping out to his right as a lefthanded quarterback this is a hard throw and then lavelle davis who originally was running an in cut does a great job of working for his quarterback and then also fighting back down to the football thats a nice play by the big freshman receiver Applause has had really an amazing season as kemp tries to spin away but they converge on him and gang up and drop him billy kemp with a loss of two yards you talk about lavell davis nice came into the ball game tim with 17 receptions and five touchdowns and 12 of his 17 catches had gone for at least 20 yards hes averaging 26 yards per reception thats number three in the country and yeah i think they need to give him more opportunities hes been so good with his opportunities that you know you cant throw the ball out of bounds or you know miss him when youre throwing it to him its got such a big catch radius just let him give it a chance intercepted as armstrong threw it right to the secondary picked off by strong he is still on his feet and finally theyre going to wrap him up after the pick dory is strong virginia tech came in tied for fourth in the country in sacks not a ton of interceptions but this is a big big play and a return of 27 im not sure who brennan armstrong is throwing this to i dont know if its a miscommunication with billy kemp i i dont know if hes just not sure about what lavell davis was doing but Applause there wasnt anybody anywhere near that football and you know from virginia and thats why strong is able to come up with the interception so final seconds of the third quarter and herbert cut back inside and the juice will step out after he picks up a first and a 14yard scamper for khalil herbert whos made some big big gains in this game huge gains hes got great vision and patience i mean that that play was designed to go to the right he ends up working his way all the way you know backside there and then does a good job of finishing well virginia tech has gone over 200 yards in rushing in the first three quarters of this game we are headed for the fourth and a hokies are on acc network college basketball coming your way tuesday 6 30 game one clemson and virginia tech and then at 8 30 georgia tech and fsu many thought florida state would go to the final four last year thats tuesday on the acc network great balance out of the hokies so far the quarterback burmeisters gonna keep it it opens up for him big gain for burmeister but you know before that play tim 200 and rushing yards 207 in passing yards for virginia tech great balance yeah great balance theyve thrown the ball well theyve been efficient with it theyve obviously run it well and right there a really nice run is you know weve seen herbert have a great night you know the keep off of that run reading an interior defender and burmeister rips off a nice one 12yard gain first down to 10 herbert wants to try outside puts on the brakes and they find him quickly zane zandir we havent called his name very often the outstanding 63 senior from pittsburgh he gets the stop thats a great observation by you dave because zandier is a running hit guy i mean weve seen him all over the field in some of the virginia games weve done hes a good tackler hes a good blitzer he kind of finds his way to the football but virginia techs done a nice job on him tonight and we have not called his name much number six in the acc and tackles per game brings up second down and 13 herbert diving into the line as he is taking down another carry stopped by alonso a gain of two Applause hokies trying to avenge a loss last year in the commonwealth cup which came right down to the last minute of play and virginia won it 3930 in charlottesville but the hokies looking to grab the cup back and keep it for a year in blacksburg and we certainly hope when they meet again there will be thousands and thousands of fans in the stands safely third down and 11 burmeister will throw this one for the end zone and too far incomplete he was looking for mitchell and they were looking for an isolation for james mitchell which they got and you know i think in these situations sometimes the quarterback did you see burn meister kind of pat his chest like hey my bad you want to give guys an opportunity to make a play on the football the reason youre looking for these isolations is usually a size advantage which mitchell had and burmeister just doesnt give him enough of a shot to play the ball so brian johnson who has connected a couple of times from 47 yards tonight coming on to kick this one from 30 with 12 52 to play here in the fourth and hokeys trying to get on the board again and again twice tonight johnson has hit a field goal from much deeper than this a 30yard attempt for virginia tech and that kick is up and it is true speed on this 76yard touchdown run and then right before the half the completion of tavion robinson and some nifty running on the sideline Music there it is you know kind of the difference so far i think about you know breakout plays but weve seen both teams sustain drives but its been the explosive plays that have been in virginia techs favor simpson trying to take it out Applause and getting across the 25yard line lets go to katie george down on the field well guys during that last break a uva grad assistant ran up to the offense and said the last time we beat these guys down here was one of the biggest comebacks in uva history we can do it again that last win in blacksburg was in 1998 uva outscored tech 293 in the second half to win it 3632 so a rallying cry on this sideline to try to come back in this one with 13 minutes to go you try anything you can right in a rivalry game you hope it really resonates we shall see with 12 41 to play and armstrong the lefty to put it in the air hes gonna fire that one incomplete trying to connect with the freshman and dorian strong with the covers the bigger problem has been virginia has not been able to stop virginia tech theyve had points up in seven out of eight drives tonight no they just they cant they they cant stop him you go eating that first drive of the game it was a holding penalty that kind of stalled that drive before a field goal but other than that pretty good penalty wise which is also helping general tech offensively dumped to simpson but not much after the catch as hes corralled by barno and just barely got that beyond the line of scrimmage for a oneyard game third down and nine and virginia certainly came in as the hot team the hokies quite cold but they have reversed rolls tonight for the most part kemp in motion armstrongs got to throw it again a short toss this time and complete to janna but hell pick up the first down a gain of 13 a bit of confusion defense virginia usually operates with good tempo and i would think that they continue to try to step on the gas a bit Applause armstrong down into the flat there darts it into the fly for davis and hes stopped by dorian strong but another good gain of 13 yards they pick up another first down i think teams that have tempo dave it kind of this jump starts them a bit to speed it up even a little bit more which they appear to be doing Applause off the play action hell keep it and trying to spin ahead armstrong takes a tumble a tackle by jalen griffin a fiveyard pickup for the quarterback out of shelby ohio against boston college he had just a spectacular game he passed for 287 yards at a touchdown he ran for 130 in a touchdown now hes running for his life and hes going to be taken down from behind and stopped by armani chapman well they bring the corner from the top of the screen and tony poljan just doesnt do a great job of setting on him you know he knows that hes coming he knows who he has to block you know normally when you bring a secondary player if you can get picked up theres opportunities in the back end and just not a great job of executing in terms of dealing with the blitz from the secondary by tony pojan well now brennan armstrong dealing with the most important third down conversion for him tonight pressure on he eludes a tackler but down he goes hes sacked on the play armstrong could not get free of richard ashby thats a seven yard loss and basically theyre going back to the play they ran earlier on third down hes trying to get janna and virginia tech does a nice job of covering it up and you know armstrong ends up being stuck with the football you can see some of the frustration and ashby whos a really good football player kind of always finds his way to the football good job of just sticking with it because weve seen armstrong kind of pull himself out of some of those plays ashby with his fourth sack he sent you an exceptional year last year so the cavaliers have to punt and mitchell is gonna let that bounce and its gonna bounce down to about the two yard line so just over with a 31 advantage last year went to virginia and bronco mendenhall 3930 and the hokies would like that cup back in blacksburg starting this drive inside the fiveyard line and a handoff as they get this one into halston for the carry and eventually stopped by king but a good gain of eight and another good example of what a job but a good job the guys up front are doing because its its not just one back its multiple backs and theres holston when youre backed up in your own end an eightyard run on first down with really good movement by the guys up front the running attack has been so good for the hokies and here with about eight and a half minutes to play you know thatll be the feature on to carrie once again its holston and some fancy footwork because hes going to pick up nine more yards again its really well blocked i mean its good movement theyre trying to work a double team and you know as we talked about earlier zane zandir usually makes a lot of you know tackles and is filling in there you know its kind of double teams getting to the second level and creating all types of room for all of the backs for virginia tech well theyve also got a very very steady effort out of the quarterback the junior from southern california braxton burmeister getting the start right out of the gate you could tell how confidently he was playing hes going to carry here and tuck and dive and hes going to gain five on that carry yeah you know quarterback sweep and it almost feels like theres a bit of a a four minute offense with about eight minutes left in this football game they try to bring zandir on a run blitz and brock hoffman the center just kind of tosses him out of the way but burn meister looks like maybe those those broken toes you talked about earlier maybe took a little little hit yeah three broken toes courtesy of an offensive lineman who we shall not name certainly not done on purpose just an accident it was about five or six weeks ago boy holstons had some really tough runs in this game cohen king with the tackle thatll get him four yards and i think in some ways for holston its been a out of a tricky year you know you have khalil herbert transfer in hes had this great year im sure that you know the expectation you know for the junior out of georgia was that you know he was going to have a bigger role and you know he still had a role hes done a nice job with his opportunities and i think they kind of make a nice onetwo punch and kind of show him what he can do well the hokies had been seriously dominating this rivalry for so long third down and one and hes able to dive ahead gam with a tackle but pick up the first down so the hokies keep on rolling here last year virginias victory in the commonwealth cup game snapped the hokies 15game winning streak last time virginia won here was 1998 a lot of these guys probably werent alive yes by the way this will be the 40th rushing attempt for virginia tech should they keep it on the ground again hes going to throw it short however and its going to be complete he got it free for a short gain of six yards burn meister able to roll out and complete that Applause timeout virginia and a time out with 5 24 to go on the full huddle and join the guys coming up as soon as we finish up tonight around 11 oclock right here on acc network led by my basketball partner jc so here comes second down and five burmeister with a handoff again its holston and hes really the workhorse here in the final moments down the stretch here for the hokies who lead it 3315 and a timeout virginia 30second timeout virginia so we will take the break as one espn app whats typically the gift that you get for your appearances on packer and durham oh im expecting uh like a really nice watch or something from the guys maybe a rolex maybe something you can drive flag down on the play as burmeister keeps and trying to slam ahead but a flag down 5 15 on the clock here rushing game has been so good for the hokies rush for 250 yards illegal motion offense fiveyard penalty replay it is by the way the sixth time this season that the hokies have rushed for at least 250 yards and running down that clock and keeping the football away from virginia third and five braxton burmeister and jumping the cavaliers so another flag down to go against virginia its actually a really nice job by burmeister there you know after that kind of get into this situation both to count virginia has been trying to run blitz you and obviously in this situation trying to do the same thing its a good job its a nice job of using the snap count you know that little clap to get a more manageable third down third and two thirty second timeout virginia tech first charge timeout theyre dragging this out so timeout pokies 4 49 remaining and still a third down into coming up the acc championship game is coming up on december 19th at 4 pm on abc between the fighting irish and the tigers this should be a dandy clemson generating over 500 yards per game at offense the last meeting november 7th notre dame knocked off the tigers 4740 was a great football game remembering because everybody does certainly in south carolina that trevor lawrence did not play in that game well for me it almost doesnt feel like a rematch but i just feel like theyre a different team and not that you know dj uengeli didnt play well he certainly did but you know it doesnt feel that way but i do think the bigger issue is you see that 47 points there i mean that venables defense you know that usually does not happen against the defense that hes coached and thats been surprised that was surprising burmeister going down out of bounds as he carried the football and stopped by nick jackson so a fourth down coming up with four and a half minutes to go fourth down and three for the hokies id be surprised if they actually stopped this football hes already gotten him to jump off once and the clock will wind on down so virginia tech taking a timeout Applause and working that clock down to 405 i think its the right decision here i mean you you know as much as you want to go for it and youve run the football well youve controlled the line of scrimmage they want a threescore game punting the football you know to a team thats got one timeout left four minutes left that you know in the game i you know it could feel like you know hey whatever youre doing you know this has been slowed down but smart by bronco to play it the way that he has but its kind of nice job of management by justin fuente in this situation on top 3315 and so getting the punt away and its going to take a hop around the 30yard line so thats where this drive will start for kemp and armstrong and company upon a 32 yards and well see what armstrong can do here in the final four minutes of play he came in a very hot quarterback the hokies you have to give them a lot of credit for slowing him down he didnt have the kind of game anywhere near the kind of game he just had against boston college got to put it in the air and going to fire this one out to kemp hes going to make some moves to gain some extra yards and he does pick up a couple and a five yard completion there second down and five for virginia armstrong time to throw throwing long over the middle and thats going to be intercepted intercepted by divine diablo wearing that number 25 he has had an outstanding night thats quite a capper for him and really shabarik connor running underneath billy camp which forces this ball to be thrown a little high and then its as you said diablo you know just been everywhere tonight i mentioned it earlier he defends the pass well he also you know come up and hit you and you know for a guy that this could end up being most likely is you know his last game in a virginia tech uniform he had a heck of a night yeah his fourth interception this season six tackles the pick hes also broken up three passes thats a really really fine night for divine diablo the senior another flag down here with three and a half to go so you put that number 25 on that frank beamer number 25 thats an honor thats the fifth time hes had an opportunity to worth it where that number usually its the number 17 he certainly did right by it in this one herbert with the carry as they will tangle him up cohen king with the stop and no gain on that rush thats a neat tradition by virginia tech its a program thats got a lot of tradition and whether its you know what you think about you know how they play special teams or the lunch pail and the defenses that have uh you know been here in the past i think its pretty cool you know where frank beamers number 25 obviously what hes meant to this football program you know and you know in many ways continues to mean to this football program so its a neat tradition and i think that devon diablo has certainly represented it well every time hes had the opportunity to wear it and certainly did tonight another beamer name in the headlines again as shane beamer who spent 20 seasons as an assistant coach just named the south carolina head coach on the 6th of december and he said you can bet frank beamer is going to be around a lot and wasnt that music to the years of the folks in south carolina you mean hes got a allaccess pass to practice in meetings is that what it sounds like i believe thats true anywhere frank wants to be and will help put his stamp and of course his son first and foremost on that program for the gamecocks holston with the carry here as we approach the threeminute mark and virginia can no longer stop the clock they are out of timeouts in all seriousness you know thats a really cool situation you know obviously youd think that shane beamer you know grew up looking up to his father you know how he coached you know probably in many ways aspired to be like his you know dad and you know and i think that its cool its cool to see that its cool to see somebody kind of probably reach that dream and have the example that that he had i know in your household you you know and your brother matthew both had your dads example who played in the nfl and you talk about role models five yard penalty here 3315 virginia tech but you know football all in the family you grew up with it the same way that shane did and benefited so much from it yeah i think its youve seen that the ads footballs family and it is a neat experience and listen i think weve seen what this season has been for so many players theres been sacrifice not seeing their families you know at times and um you know its more than just one person out on a football field making it happen its theres a lot of other things that go into it its a big time commitment for a lot of people coaches included and so you know whether its a coach whether its these players um you know as we kind of you know see an acc season you know played throughout this year probably just a good opportunity to kind of acknowledge these guys for how theyve met the commitment of playing you know in virginias case being available to play every time they were asked yeah thats pretty remarkable which you know is hard to do and you know in virginia tech who lets face it they played some games with players that they probably would have preferred not to have out in the field but that was what they were tasked with this year im gonna punt this one away on fourth down and 18 as that takes a hop right around the 45yard line to flag down a minute 34 to go and his game has dragged out here in the last few moments but will not take away from the fact that virginia tech has played one of their better games of the season here tonight and a loss for virginia will put them at five and five and a victory for the hokies make them five and six now virginia tech has gone to a bowl game every year since 1993 the longest streak in the nation number 32 middlesex declined half so youre talking about 27 in a row next up georgia 23 in a row there is no wins requirement to go to a bowl this season thats been waived but the hokies could have a major decision to make as far as whether they want to participate in a bowl should they be invited and thats going to be common with a lot of programs dont you think theyre exhausted though i do just theyve kind of been through the fire and i and i think that justin fuente i think hes been pretty candid and clear about kind of the emotional exhaustion of what theyve gone through you know he said look i mean its not like he was swinging a sledgehammer every morning but we mentioned it tested 40 times throughout the year these guys have been through a lot missed their families quite a bit and so feels right for them to kind of finish it like this the senior from venice florida with the sack he talked about this week oh hes really worn that loss last year to virginia how it really wore on the pokies all year long but now they are about to get the commonwealth cup back in blacksburg and they do it with a victory here tonight against the virginia cavaliers on the field here at lane stadium armstrong back to throw as he will scamper away again hes had a tough night with a couple of picks does get that one away for lavell davis who never really got free to hurt the hokies tonight not in a big way anyway and few did for virginia and on the other side it was a big big touchdown reception by tavion robinson in the first half and khalil herbert broke free and ran for 76 yards in the most spectacular play of the night those are the two biggest ones for the hokies and here in the final seconds they can celebrate they are going to knock off virginia and return the commonwealth cup to blacksburg yeah i think justin fuente deserves a little credit dave i mean you referenced it in this game and you know during the game that look virginia was a hot team trending in the right direction and the same could not be said for virginia tech and so with everything going on holidays on the horizon to you know to get his team to rally the way that they rallied in a meaningful game you know for these programs i think he deserves a lot of credit for that and i think the players deserve a lot of credit for that as well well the cavaliers in the red zone first and ten for armstrong and he will fire that one incomplete and intended for henry Applause so the hokies about to finish the regular season at five and six they will not have a game next week virginia was offered the opportunity to play next week theyve declined that opportunity so their regular season ends tonight flagged down here on a false start yard pitta second down now we will see if either one of these schools will elect to go bowling here in 2020 but with everything that has happened and with the pandemic and all of the stresses and frankly the exhaustion of having to try and play every week and being pretty darn successful at that for both of these schools it just might be the end of it here tonight in 2020 another stop for connor whos had a really fine night defensively for the hokies so the few fans that are allowed here at lane stadium getting the chance to celebrate a victory over their rivals as armstrong scampers away looking for the end zone and he fires as that is broken up intended for davis with just five seconds on the clock virginia tech 253 rushing yards kalil herbert the star 162 rushing yards and 20 carries and the defense sacked the quarterback four times and picked off brennan armstrong twice tonight at least to this point on fourth down and 12 hes going to fire that one incomplete and now the celebration really beginning in earnest here for the hokies and certainly not the same when youre not amidst the pandemic as far as that celebration is concerned but theyre going to enjoy it nonetheless the hokies knock off the cavaliers here tonight in blacksburg and tim your final thoughts well im impressed by the effort of virginia tech been through a lot this season i think theres a lot of frustration but in a rivalry game kind of show up and play the way they played on both sides of the football was really impressed with that effort and virginia has had a nice year and done a great job of being available every week pretty good season for them but certainly not the way they wanted to end it here in the commonwealth cup well you can see the dominance in the cup for the hokies 202 against virginia over the last 22 meetings and this one tonight goes into the hands of coach fuente and the hokies 33 to 15 for my partner tim hasselbeck and for katie george im dave obrien thanks for joining us on this saturday night jc in the huddle coming to your way next here on the acc Music network
