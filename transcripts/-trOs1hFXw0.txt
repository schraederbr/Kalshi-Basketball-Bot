23 years and led this program to an ACC tournament Championship M shury took Penn State to the NCAA tournament last year for the first time since 2011 Notre name and the Home White Florida State the traveling black gold and Garnet and Florida State will have the first possession three in one in conference play looking for that first true Road win for the nolles on the road warley trying to work inside hes got the open man and Monte green this is big time for Florida State cuz it allows them to set that full CT pressure to try and generate those turnovers forcing about 16 per game a turnover percentage of the opposition of about 20 but it all starts with their ability to put the ball in the basket notor aame coming off the win Tuesday at Georgia Tech in overtime 7568 overcoming 39 shooting as a team Stripped Away and here come the nolles up ahead warley couldnt get the angle second effort knocked around ji had it for a moment and now Roper has it for the Irish an early sample size what floor St likes to do a deflection leads to a run out just cant convert PNE had it rejected Baba Miller got back defensively to erase that shot from fzn Baba Miller length athleticism and timing all coming in an intersection there for a highlight block defending the rim a lot of professional Scouts here with eyes on black jersey number what he can provide both defensively and offensively now has 17 blocks this season to lead Florida State in that category Burton shot clock inside a 10 over two Defenders Marcus Burton just comfortable among the trees got a little bit of Separation fading and put the arc on it to go untouch hes a tough finisher freshman score for the Irish and a three wide open for green Bronte green felt a nice little jump there early on getting the layup and working his way out getting warm here this is rer trying to answer from the corner raise the backboard for green he had been one of 10 from Beyond The Arc prior to that shot averaging six and A2 points per game for Florida Music State Watkins almost lost it Shu and thats what Notre Dame wants to do they want to set that defense even sag a little bit pack it in Dare the NS to make some of these threepoint shots but make them have to operate in the halfcourt setting if Notre Dame is able to Come Away With Victory today that would be three ACC wins that would equal the total from a season ago when they went three and 17 and finished 14th in the conference 11 and 21 overall last year kzle the kick coming out of the corner for three and its Booth this is the game plan for this Irish group drive and kick theres going to be opportunities to pursue gaps Booth whos starting to play his best basketball as a freshman get acclimated steps to do a good one off the glass and good on the drive from Watkins at the other Applause end mention hes the leading scorer for Florida State just over 1 points per game and shoots 42 from the floor and it helps when you driveing for the layup Burton on the back door cut kesn from the corner and he connects for three great execution Cutters and a highlevel decision from Burton to distribute to the Baseline of kesn for three 19 made threes on the season now for kesn and roer came away with that one found Burton its rare to have decision making like that a freshman and here he goes again finding his guys for shooting opportunities Roper cannot find the range from threepoint real estate but Burton having the opportunity to get into the teeth of the defense collaps it exploited for looks warley crossed it over on the drive and now Burton will pick up his first personal foul Tom check it out right here great spacing good back cut now the defense vulnerable draw and Miller kick out to the Baseline three kesn threepiece nuget that certainly is a positive for Notre Dame despite that foul being assessed to Burton that by kesn this noted aim team shoots 29 from Beyond The Arc that his last in the ACC they made two early on here in the first half and yet Tom theyre still not going to shy away from taking it top 50 in threepoint shots taken this year thats spins off the r and rim and rope are again able to Corral Applause it and Notre Dame will pump up about 243 attempts per game and in total they only Trail pit in total threepoint attempts as kesn stumbles down but again its the belief from coach Shrewsberry this roster theyve constructed is built with Shooters just quite frankly as theyre learning a system learning to play with each other theyre finding their Strokes so those percentages are dismal but theyre theyre head strong and its still going to be pursue gaps drive and kick and take those threes eventually the numbers will start to come your way and they have in the last few games Florida State interception on the re inbound wish was called a foul on the play thatll be against ji his first think it spoke to desperation from kesn on the out of bounds under trying to inbound the basketball I mean percentage of completion there 0 on Wild Card Saturday I think that thatd be fair to call it Florida State coming off the win Tuesday against Wake Forest 878 two they shot 51 as the team its warley with the short jumper Florida State went to the line 30 times in that game against Wake Forest in Tallahassee the May 24 of them got to try and find a touch for Kev down low just to kind of settle their offense here you go hes got to be aggressive here not waitting got some space put it on the floor Miller deflected the first shot second effort in a congested area and a whistl and foul so ja sticking with it foul on the play Slim lead for Florida State in the first half on the CW sit and rot over there on the bench and Ill Ill find a way Ill go and talk to the people in compliance I will help you transfer cuz this culture is getting built the right way and if you aint a part of it youre out and I dont care know and that was after the loss December 19th against the 6545 strong words from the head coach and for those who maybe arent in the know coach shuberry was a hell of a player for one so he gets it from that side hes got a great sense of humor for two very underrated there spent a lot of time hanging out with him yesterday but he has a great pulse for his group and its a very new group and what was fascinating about that is thats that excerpt that sound bite we heard he said that to his group in the locker room so it wasnt new to them but he took culpability in the fact that he said in building a culture the group needs to know each other and so he wanted to sit him down as Miller goes in the drive and the cut gets an offensive rebounding opportunity there for gy but what shwy said was these guys are so new together this group they need to get to know each other why do you play basketball why did you choose Notre name and in that they grew closer hes he noticed a disconnect with the team made them closer started translate into better basketball and they get two at the other end as well J saw those numbers that have improved both ends of the floor for the Fighting Irish seven and nine this season theyre five and five at home as they welcome Florida State the only regular season meeting between the teams this season Shrewsbury has the rebound green takes a look there from three now he is one of the more dangerous guys shooting around 42 from distance but still its still going to feel a pack in defense with the Irish and dare this Florida State team to beat him from three PNY trying to work that Baseline around Miller threading that pass a tough catch for G in a turnover Watkins with the kick the threepointer in the Miss on the attempt from Green this feels like a a possession where the Irish need to run some sort of set develop a little bit of a rhythm here in the half court offering to get them going here again and obviously take care of the basketball against so grabbing his for State Defense Burton wants three and he will have it just 28 from the on the arc so far this season for Burton but on target with that attempt G inside double fisted Rim rocker once again for KY I mean thats pretty impressive offensive sequence from Baba Miller right there operating with his size to be able to Tribble Baseline commit two Defenders and dump off guard likee skill shoes beheaded blocked by gy at the other end Jaylen gy the graduate student from Greensboro North Carolina open Lane and drive Derek green Jr for two once again a sequence where the nolles Kickstart the offense with a shot block from Dany to get him going the other way to in pursuit of the early offense green Jr had 17 points in the win against Wake Forest High rebound kesn stays with it Second Chance On The Possession Burton able to get it away from gainy kick KES for three warley does not have the numerical advantage and will wait for reinforcements Watkins out of that corner foul goes against Watkins on the Applause drive well get a look look like it was C trying to step in for the charge do I mean noncommittal quite frankly I mean take one more step stay sturdy to plant those feet oh wait they did give it to him they did call I didnt think that was a charge to be quite honest I didnt think he had set himself up I thought he initiated the contact surpris yeah the point of emphasis this season the defender must be in position outside of the restricted area prior to the plant foot going down for the driving player so that is really the indicator that the officials are looking for today Remy stons Roger SS and Justin Porterfield in charge of the action so Watkins to the Florida state bench hes got another look yeah I thought at the last minute I I felt like J leaned in to initiate the contact there I thought that could have very well gone either way so Watkins is one for three from the floor couple of points and hes on the bench now with those two personal fouls IM is into the lineup as well as for Notre Dame shb who made Five threes the OT win tried to attack the glass and missed shuberry has been that microwave coming off the bench for this Irish team Jackson into the lineup zero for Florida State also B Bowen number 10 for the rolls Spears wants a jumper Primo Spears the transfer from Georgetown knocking it down theyre waiting for him to get going uh mechanically a beautiful stroke percentages havent played that way but hes a big time threat theyre waiting for him to have that Breakout game that could be this afternoon for the nlls couple the players got tangled up underneath nickelberry going to be called for the foul for Florida State its a fourpoint lead for the nolles on the road on the SE back a lot of the same people still around it just speaks how special this place is not just the the the school itself the program but the city of South Bend is a second home for me and my family and its always great coming back here great people special place and its all CU of Coach prey that I was here and still am in an Irish uniform from 01 to 05 and the Notre Dame all time leading shop Locker Jord cor thatll win you a lot of trivial Pursuits the most obscure record holder in all of college basketball I just played with guys who didnt defend all they could do is score so how was that last line of defense State trying to defend Julian roer shock clock is down to eight for Burton down to three rer the recognition and the shot and he knocks it down how about Applause it roer the best threepoint shooter by percentage for this Irish team 33 and hes now made 17 of them on the season I think that also illustrates eliminates the woes from distance for an Irish group that really struggles 33 is solidly average at best but he provides a confident play there for them on their home floor to kind of get him going and the Irish have made four threepointers in this first half Burton has one of them Zona fought on the glass with B Bowen Primo Spears midrange buron up for the Applause rebound back door to Burton from shury Iron and B Bowen Burtons done a Sublime job of moving without the basketball being a receiver cutting putting pressure on that defense again there couldnt convert but I like how hes thinking the game even when hes not dominating the basketball Cameron corn is also into the game for Florida State number three hes trying to get that Miss on the offensive glass comes back out nickelberry Spears in traffic got the shot away was a whistle prior to that shot attempt underneath he was fouled on the Applause play I think they call that an an one oh Bowen right place right Music time so Taylor B Bowen to the free throw line The Freshman from Jericho Vermont roer picked up the foul for the irishes first so they will count that bucket chance at the old school threepoint Play What a story that young man is Jordan born in a refugee camp in Egypt moved to the United States when he was 2 years old and the Bowen family in Vermont adopted him his parents had to flee the Civil War in the sedan pretty incredible its amazing played at Brewster Academy in New Hampshire for his prep ball he is into the box score for Leonard Hamilton an offensive rebound Thomas what gets him there and that was a concern coming in for the Irish look this is not a very good defensive rebounding team for the noes but they can get on the offensive guys and turn you over just like that so it looked like Spears might have had it but he was on the end line so possession back to Notre D dess been very Loosey Goosey with the basketball couple turnovers couple near turnovers needs to utilize the head fake I Telegraph as much of what hes doing three turn turnovers so far in the first half of the Irish and that thats going to be a foul against Tom house who is in there Florida state will use a large amount of players right the last two games theyve used 11 players and all of them have scored at least one point in those two games theres an art to that system for Coach ham because guys need to be engaged even when theyre on the bench but he said this and he said it for years you know this Tom he says in my system you cant play for 35 minutes guys are asking to come out cuz we want foot on the gas in spurts sub out new bodies overwhelm the opposition and its worked over the years for a legend I he a lot of creative dribbling and then he lays it in on the drive its a Florida State team in his personal defensively that can switch everything when you do that sometimes there can be a miscommunication at times and you got to explore that Gap and Im just had that sequence Miller has to kick it out to Green seven different nles have scored so far in the first half Spears will spin in the paint come up short IMS goes after it on the Baseline cant pull it in to State basketball Irish have to feel good about how they valued the basketball against this very opportunistic NOS defense but in terms of the off defensive rebounding assignment theyre starting to shy away from grabbing those rebounds noes have five offensive boards here weve only played about 11 minutes of basketball this is green Rising for a three Zona over the top for the Applause Music Applause board aame out rebounding Georgia Tech on the road for the OT win 4833 with a 15 rebound advantage in that OT fact they played three overtime games this season and gone two and one shury stumbling hes going to get subed out for that that that was out of control offense I can read coach pretty well there BR needs to move that basketball theres been a few sequences for the Irish too much dribbling not enough moving the basketball which is the game plan to get the NOS in rotation and try to take advantage Miller steps into the three ball bounces around the corner and goes out of bounds to Notre Dame dead ball though does give the NES the opportunity to apply that full court pressure here they try and get one get a takeaway here from the Irish and try and Music build Florida State able to turn way T over 20 times in that fivepoint victory that game featured six ties and seven lead changes going down that road again this afternoon underneath twisting shot conne they got the switch they liked IM on Miller hes able to drive it a little bit then playing off of it kesn has the cutter they have been active with Cutters and its provided very nicely for the Irish in this first stance our fourth tie of the first half Miller try to untie us Zona fought off one man with one arm and then grabbed the rebound IMS again out out perimeter Works to kesn on the drive cut off and then finds eyes theyre just whipping that ball around Roper for three thats a beautiful offense that is an offensive cut up that you show your guys and say bottle this up and lets serve that every time offensively drivers swing ball movement everybody touches it and rer the best threepoint shooter delivers from distance five of 10 on threepointers in the first half for Notre D Florida state has missed eight of its last nine and now nine of 10 backb crushing cant get those defensive rebounds threepointer another Miss green couldnt find it noted aim in the midst of a 70 run Applause lesy down the lane spins got the shot away and was fouled it has some length three blocks are one of the best shot blocking teams in the conference so when you come you better come correct in the paint uh this is a group that is going to apply some pressure they have some athletes they let that defense key their offense but the Irish arent worried about the interior no no theyre dialing down from distance and theyre doing it with movement theyre getting in Florida State into rotations a group that shoots sub 30 for three on the season in the Irish are five of 10 shooting 50 I got to chuckle because said to coach Hammer said its not like those typical Bray threepoint shooting teams he goes Jordan Im going stop you right there Notre Dame has a chance to get hot at any time it always seems like they we get their best shooting when we Face them right now thats absolutely whats happening but is at the free throw line for Notre Dame hes got one of those made threes Burton has made one rer two and Carrie Booth had an early threepointer as well for the Irish by the way how much fun is it just chopping up with Coach ham had to shoot around in the practice like we were able to do last yesterday asleep ago I mean just incredible guy I mean forget about the basketball chatter just a life chatter amazing conversation with the 75y old coach from Gaston County North Carolina looks better than me and you both sorry inred just being honest youll get no argument thats bouncing around after the miss all kinds of contact inside as Corin tried to follow his Miss and picked up the foul cant just push a guy in the back I mean look at him hes glowing in South Bend nonetheless you know how you aint seen a sun out here its gloomy its great that guy looks fresh most wins in school history 22nd year in Florida State 36 year overall as a head coach Oklahoma State Miami the NBA Washington what a career 12 Seasons at Kentucky under Joby Hall that includes the National Championship in 78 hes a Trailblazer and when you live a clean good life like you like he has you look like that he was the first black mens basketball player at UT Martin back in 1969 hes open up a lot of doors for a lot of people amazing including both of us yes warley lot of dribbling that foul is going to be against J second on J so ja is replaced by Zona Florida State Jordan has missed 12 of its last 13 shot attempts and yet still a fourpoint game it speaks to who Notre Dame has become defensively since the call out from coach shw in that loss of the Citadel coach shy came out of here narrowly with a Duke win and said these guys can really guard theyre a tough out and theyre proving it here in the first 15 holding the opposition to 41 shooting this season second best in the ACC off of the Miss off of the backboard and two for warley Florida state has been the tougher team when the 5050 balls present themselves or the balls coming off the back foro for offensive rebounding opportunities thats the one area where the Irish have kept the door open for the nles to keep it close rley now has four points in the first half this is Burton drops it off Zona got the defender in the air it was Darren Green Jr and he took an awkward tumble well we have a moment Tuesday on inside the NFL nobody he breaks down games like our crew with highlights and Analysis you wont find anywhere else this week the guys take a look back at Super wild card weekend and get you ready for the divisional round Inside the NFL Tuesday 87 Central only on the CW hey you get you get Chad former leooo back to Johnson on anything Im watching Im a Bengals guy till the end we should have been in the playoffs this year but look we had some tough breaks most notably Joe Burrows wrist right there with you Jordan when the Patriots arent involved although the legend retires they go right to Gerard Mayo been there I mean life for him with the Patriots its all he knows right drafted by him and stayed within the franchise so there is a Timeout on the floor taken by Florida State twopoint game Florida State down to 33 shooting in this first half noted aim conversely 47 and theyre five of 10 from Beyond The Arc Florida state is one of seven on threepoint attempts Ive been very impressed with how the Irish have moved the basketball how theyve gotten Florida State in rotations how theyve made the self extra pass to go from good shot opportunity to elite shot opportunity been impressed with the fight from Florida State most especially on the backboard to keep this thing close they generated some turnovers to give him life with runouts they havent generated the amount of turnovers they would have wanted in this first half to push them to be leading this game but thats why you see a tight one its been the backboard offensively for Florida State its been a threepoint shot for the Irish in these first 15 we are one of seven games on the ACC slate today many of you watched the first game of our CW Courtside Saturday double header and saw NC State improve to 41 in the ACCC with an 8983 win at Moville by the way NC State is now on five their last six and North Carolina they won six in a row undefeated in conference that should count for two wins I mean I I dont know how you lets not get crazy now I mean Syracuse guy talk to I will say going back to the off def rebounding from Florida State theyve shot the ball 30 times to Notre Dames 19 theyre taking 11 more shots because of course they missed but theyve gone and got it back to give themsel a shot and thats why this games where its at score once theres another one had it bounce off Baba Miller and then they convert thats Darren Green Jr theres got to be a high level of frustration from coach Shrewsberry because how good youve been defensively just making a oneoff each time defend just one get the thing going the other way then you build tring to defend once well and then you get exploited the second time and weve got a tie score for the fifth time this afternoon now tied to 24 stay that way Zona tried to grab it Miller was there as well and the officials say that is off of Florida State nine offensive rebounds for the nolles Andy Youre tracking towards 20 offensive rebounds in a game I mean that is wholly unacceptable for any team Golds are in the midst of a threegame winning streak wins against wake Virginia Tech and Georgia Tech the only loss in ACC play December 2nd at number s North Carolina Roper looking to win this match up versus gy against two Defenders gy recovered and tipped it but it was the help from Green being there to slow him down for gainy to come recover and block the shot Jaylen warley driving and creat in contact and hell be at the free throw line when we come back tied for the fifth time of the first half exactly 4 minutes to go the Apex in this game this is who he can be nobody on the Notre Dame team and quite frankly maybe college basketball works as hard as this guys a gymrat its eventually going to click with his level of talent look he started the season probably a lot of pressure coachs son new place again hes a freaking freshman like its a lot coming at you hes 20 of 77 from 3 26 starting to become more comfortable with his teammates the system the level of play and hes T of his last 17 shoot nearly 60 hes going to be okay uh but the level of pressure for him to be the lone shooter is simply too much hes getting it from the other guys now as well 0 for two from the floor so far for shury in 10 minutes of action when he scored the 25 on Tuesday he played 32 minutes was perfect from the free throw line five of Nine Season high five made threes for shrewbury talking to coach Shrewsberry before on on the heels of that performance from Braden and I said to him I said you know did you know he was ready for one of those he said you could just see in his eyes hes like hes my son I know when hes got a little bit of that extra umph to him that Swagger the heads Bob in pregame and again with how he played coming off Duke he was ready for that and off the inbounds Notre Dame turns it over Jaylen warley was at the free throw line for Florida State hes their leading scorer in the first half with six points for the Junior from Philadelphia Pennsylvania to 6 points4 boards and all of his points in the win against wake came from the free throw Music Applause line warley oh he got away with one there his triple team for a moment clean blockouts from the Irish you give a chance to go the other way way Irish have lost three in a row in the series including the two meetings between the teams last year in December and January of the year last year December match up just a onepoint loss the nne in trouble gave it back to the nolles just just doing too much hes hes had a few sequences like that in his game look he plays with the nedge that the Irish need it fuels them but hes got to make quicker decisions and just you dont have anything moving six turnovers in the first half for noted a just two for the N Miller to the rim and itll fall and hes going to the line its a pro move pro move from Baba Miller right there understanding at 611 he has a good 34 in Advantage right here and he wastes no time doesnt allow helide to get there because of how decisive he was with the offering in the interior get one to going I I did mention theres professional Scouts here to watch him that those are the kind of moments they want to see from The Uber skilled hybrid forward eight points and five rebounds the averag is for Baba Miller who completes the old school threepoint play the sophomore from mayorca Spain the Mediterranean island 611 204 Applause and I believe his ceiling is so incredibly high he hasnt fully recognized his ability and what he can be in this game quite yet and I think thats very aing to SC time shury had it knocked away deflected by warley the attempted free throw line jumper war will direct a little bit of traffic with two and A2 minutes to go in the first half tried to Chisel his way through two Defenders couldnt Do It Good Help side from Zona Shrewsberry O8 defense thats too easy of a Blow by defensively Zona there to pick him Applause up Florida States lead is Music five Burton had it knocked away how about that fight he goes to the floor and gets it the Zona with the fake and Miller he defending Miller went up and got a piece of the rim there as Zona put the fake on Miller I Ill tell you when you average 16 points a game and youre fighting for possessions like this for your team thats how you Garner the respect of your teammates and you want to play for a guy like that you want to see your stars willing to do the dirty things that it takes to win generating a possession right there for zon to get to the line a great example so Burton will get a breather no a with the free throw line with Zona just one of seven so far free throws now one of eight been a lane violation there coach ruseberry just shouting take your time dont rush it nobodys guarding it easy for me to say please do not Google my free throw percentage nobody needs to know that I mentioned the shot blocking we took care of that good stuff zonas now 0 for three from the line one of eight is a its a lot of money left on the table Tom Applause wow a is a team 73 from the line 10th in the conference for the complete body of work Spears angles his way pesni able to pull it Applause in 145 on the game clock theyre sending doubles if youre dribbling too long theyre going to try and pick the pocket good drive strong drive from kesn taking advantage of the Gap opportunity that stops a 90 run for Florida State threepoint game Mar just lead by either team in the first half five for Florida State Corin missed from in close eyes able to grab Applause it get out get out timeses will cross it over against Corin out to rer Long rebound Spears one on two roer was back defensively and picks up the foul unlucky bounce there from the Irish on the the shot opportunity gets it off and then Spears is going with a lot of momentum and Ste team I I saw no contact there from Julian roer certainly nothing that would result in a whistle and a foul its a second foul on roer who has six points kzn leads the way with eight for Notre Dame in the first half Spears at the free throw line coming up on the Subaru halftime report Notre Dame Indiana we get a recap from NC State and Louisville a win by the wolf pack on the road preview of the womens game tomorrow Miami and Notre Dame highlights and stats

Coach Neil ivy in the Irish with Olivia out still recovering from that knee injury its been nice to be able to bring somebody in that could provide those type of numbers that Hannahs provided for this Irish group yeah they had a huge win against Boston College on Thursday and theyll take the court tomorrow against Katie Meers hurricanes from Miami thatll be a good one cuz the Irishman struggle with those those athletic teams like Miami presents Syracuse gave them problems with their athleticism so thats no easy one for the Irish thatll be a good good game well have it for you tomorrow on the CW noon time right now weve got inside of a minute to go in our first half 531 seconds in the fivepoint lead for Florida State I think you see some sort of exchange here with kesy and Burton if Burton doesnt just get it going right away but these two been able to open something up five points in the first half for Burton kzn shot clock at Applause 10 Burton time Burton just launches that three and knocks it down second made three of the game Marcus Burton and hes got eight points never felt sped up stayed within himself safe composed gathered Square the shoulders and deliver Worley against two Defenders Dany had a chance at it run down by bu Bowen hell take it right to the rim oh he calculated the angle right at the end of the half score the basket bull Bowen on the drive the length ready to crank up the second half from Notre Dame Indiana CW Sports in our presentation of ACC basketball Tom wormy Jordan cornette former Notre Dam standout alltime leading shop locker and our outstanding production crew that is Burton has to send it back out 44 from the floor in the first half for the Irish too much dribbling this where you get in trouble got to move that thing five on the shot PNE that tripped up and he traveled possession was doomed from the beginning with Julian Roper dribble dribble dribble dribble dribble and thats what coach Shrewsberry is is kind of helping him along with after The Possession ultimately ended up where we knew it was going turnover roer had six points in the first half on a couple of made threes both Burton and kesn had eight points eight different players with an all scored in that first half warley literally oneonone with Roper and warley wins it its decent defense better offense to be a to elevate over with your strong hand on that on that left side nonetheless tough angle gets it to go biggest lead by either team right now it is six for Florida State nolles won here a year ago in January last season 8471 quni missed fires the other meeting was December of last season Jordan a onepoint win at home for Florida State which has won three in a row in the series early again these two give you the theatrics give you the dramatics Im here for it told you how close their last five games have Applause been that bounces off the side of the rim for Watkins Irish in transition with rer line L up the three got his own Applause Miss great pass from kesn daylight for Burton he misses pristine looks thats whats plagued them when theyre at that low level when theyre getting great looks and cant convert Watkins inside in some traffic meanwhile Florida State foot on the gas trying to take it to the rim challenge the the the fortitude intestinally of this group can defend on the interior four points for jir Applause Music Applause Watkins thats going to go against the Irish and Burton thats his third so Burton with eight points three of six from the floor picks up the foul for the Irish couple early turnovers for the Irish thats what Florida State wants to do but it disrupts a rhythm and Florida State quietly building a lead here in this first segment of the second half and Watkins just had that last basket he had 19 points to lead the team in that win Tuesday at home against Wake Forest nzn and roer comining on the defensive effort but a foul is called Florida stay very aware of that one of eight from the threepoint line performance in the first first half and theyre saying were were coming at you forget the threepoint line were in attack mode Lets Get downhill lets draw some fouls lets see how tough this Notre Dame defense truly Applause is Watkins at the free throw line 80 free throw Applause shooter and that is the first Miss from the line in the game for Florida State they had been six of six in the first half for cant blame me for that one Jordan I waited till after the free throw the Jinx youre right to make the mention red shirt Jr from Trenton New Jersey a transfer from Virginia Commonwealth at the free throw Applause line so over halftime now its a 70 run for Florida State and Notre Dame is 0 for three from the floor with a couple the turnovers early on in this second Applause half pesni trying to get it the giant side good catch Miller was ready defensively firing away for three right in front of his own bench for Darren Green Jr and a timeout Notre Dame defense re B Miller shot block gets them going ignites it going the other way the three ball dial down for Darren Green in Florida State taking firm control Florida state with an 80 run to start the second half and they are doing it defensively picking up right where they left off in the first half now six blocks as a team in the game been really impressed and the late great Bill Russell would appreciate it too Baba Miller able to block the shot keep it in play to get them going the other way with momentum and green gets the three ball to go they havent shot the three well they havent really particularly shot it well all season but shots like that provide greater opportunity and green is one of the best Shooters on the floor for this group defensively theyve applied pressure on the Irish theyve turned him over and theyre starting to be in attack mode offensively as well everything falling in line for the nolles both teams average about seven made threes per game Notre Dame ripped off six made threes in the first half yet to score in the second half pesni down the lane triple team hes going too far he hes got to play off two its got to be a jump stop must play off two instead of driving too far into the defense into a dead end hes done it too many times today KY reather sends it back out warley Miller has an advantage over Imes trying to use it bounces out Im with the basketball shoes Bri Zona straight away front rim couldnt follow the Miss Darren Green Jr deflected kesn able to grab a great effort at a foul is called warley was near him and he will pick up his second personal Notre Dame basketball when we come back on the CW with a little added Swagger look padulla is tactician with the B basketball uh he can make a lot of things happen hes deceptively has a burst to him and hes got a trigger from Beyond the yard they play through him his confidence only he grew throughout that game what a performance backto back career highs 32 and 26 points for pedulla also leads them in steals and assists for head coach Mike young in Virginia Tech couple of years removed from their ACC tournament Championship Notre name trailing right now 4129 trying to Harvest their first points of the second half they dont score a ton they can blabber to do it so this feels like an important juncture in this game no question especially after the effort by kenni to get the ball back at the other end Burton was driving in a whistling foul Applause up second on green junr for Florida State this the second of our two games on CW Courtside Saturday most of you saw NC State proove its ACC record to 41 8983 on the road of Lou bir and the leading score for the Irish this season is The Freshman roer got the start today in place of Tay Davis in the shot box is down to four for shury step in Applause back Jordan his first two points of the game now one of four from the floor but very confident pulled back realized 6 seconds it was on him in isolation got to his spot steep back once again for separation seeing the growth of the confidence of that young man as a score 25 points in the OT win against Georgia Tech on Tuesday for shre deep into the shot clock for the nolles tough shot on the Baseline picked up by Burton Burton accelerating change of speed and hes fouled on the attempt its going to be what Chandler Jackson theyre going to get on that one you love the aggressive nature in which ber pushes in the open floor had nobody accompanying him on his own team enforcements coming down with him but undeterred Fearless driving it to the rack so Burton to the free throw line for the first time in the game Jordan one of eight so far from the line and now Burton knocks down the second free throw of the game for the Irish and you would expect that 10th in the conference 83 for the Freshman from Mishawaka Indiana right here no Jinx there for my guy Tom two for two and all of a sudden the Irish couple buckets consecutively in a stop built in hes got 10 points now for the 15th time this season double figure scoring for Bur along the Baseline of the jumper Spears Spears got the exchange he wanted had Zona defensively on his heels he had a clean look for the Baseline able to connect so Spears now up to six points in the game he struggled against wake four is just one of six shooting miscommunication Burton able to keep it alive Im spinning High degree of difficulty and he lays it off the glass but you the difference in that exchange is a jump stop he came to a composed stop so its not to charge so its not to lose the basketball that composure to then go up with the layup was everything one basket in the Freshman is is above his season average Burton the steel and the Applause Layin here comes the Irish down by six Applause Watkins deep into the teeth of the Irish D and that is off of Notre aame take a look what Im talking about with I its not a standard come to two but its that stop pivot then hes gathered himself now hes ready to go up sturdy to go up and finish for two not out of control a tough Drive stop compos then go he now has four points that is part of an 82 Notre Dame Applause run Crow was getting a look at the replay that out of bounds play on the big monitor above the court here at purcel Pavilion home of Irish basketball since 1968 incredible renovations to this facility to say the least man I remember what I was like when I played here from 01 to5 as a transfer from Georgetown and duaine stolen back it is Spears on the dribble and the kick warley filling the lane and putting it in vintage Florida State apply ball pressure turnover guys fill Lanes easy layup the other way and all the momentum on the no side here on the road seeking their first true Road win of the season warley is the first Florida State player into double digits he now has 10 on four of eight shooting Burton the fake got through the Defenders couldnt finish it off and Zona tried to volleyball it out warle hell drive it again too strong in Alberton were running up and down the court and its not the pace the Irish want to play at shury for three follow Roper try to jam it he got it back try to go up strong and denied by Jackson Applause Burton defending Spears able to save it Miller passing tight quarters to Corin who puts it in and earns a free throw Florida State flexing their muscle and theyre doing it on the defensive end to Spur everything almost an unforced error there of schs and then on the brought out jayen W thats what we call accumulation that is what we call South B thats all right were here November December January February March even April I mean how about these fans coming off to see this game this afternoon yeah theyre hoping to see the Irish provide a little bit more of a fight and some resistance as Florida States taking firm control coring at the free throw line thats eight straight points in a minute in change for Florida State just a minute ago it was 4337 but that lead is swelled for Florida State the foul is called on the NOS Jackson will pick it up second foul on Jackson to State just so the closing speed is impressive the suffocating nature of this full court pressure and theres no foot off the pedal because theyre playing 13 guys so a lot of guys are getting run overwhelming amazingly Florida State according to their Sid Chuck Walsh 20 players on the roster for the NES and a lot of them the vast majority see action nine players have scored for Florida State today inside of 10 for rer pesni the safety Val theyre bothered theyre bothered by the pressure double team they get the shot away Miss from Booth remember he had an early threepointer in this one these are not confident drives from the Irish they feel like the looks theyre taking are by all accounts desperation shots Florida States doing a heck of a job at this Spears look just fire away this board from kesn M Dame stopped the two game losing streak with its win on the road at Georgia Tech on Tuesday that was in overtime outscore Georgia Tech 92 in the overtime period kzne reversing Applause field lead in the shot clock for Imes and that one spins Applause in so IMS has shown a propensity to drive and find daylight a couple of layups Spears absorbing contact his shot was way off Jordan how about H got to have one of these Booth hustled in after his Miss and laid it in now thats old school basketball yeah thatll get you excited to follow your Miss shot and thats what boot did boot knew when he let it go it was short uh good judgment from him to understand where that think it was going to Caren off and he just beat Florida State to the punch Bo has five points in the game you dont see that enough you got out of your chair my friend we both appreciated that body follows foul coming up Im talking about as soon as Booth release watch hes running after me he goes oh no no no that I know thats bad goes right there three Defenders dont watch me watch TV get the put back did you see the reaction from Jackson zero for Florida State he was just ready to have that one fall right into his lap nobody theres no rebounders down there and no one follows their shot anymore and that could maybe Kickstart this Irish team give him some belief Florida state has taking the majority of it from them here in the second half the lead is 10 going to stay that way by the way kesd picked up his third personal on the previous sequence prior to the whistle theyre going to keep him out hes got the ball right now had it poked Away by Watkins it will stay with Notre Dame mentioned the rebounding Jordan a slight Edge to Florida State right now 3231 something to keep an eye on Notre Dames on a good job of keeping them off that offensive backboard for the most part in in this second half I should say Burton over gainy the taller player does not matter to Burton all of 511 and the Freshman without fear here and 14 points remember he had 29 Points in his freshman debut against Niagara to set a School record thats out of bounds and back to the Irish so a few minutes ago they were able to cut the lead to six and then Florida State went on a run capable hands of Burton impressive freshman player also had a 20point game against Marette which is a national Applause Contender Burton cross it over tried to kick it was deflected shury lets it go out of bounds and Burt frustrated because once he got into that nail into the paint he knew he had a committed Defender he knew he had Shrewsberry for a catch and shoot opportunity the deflection from these active Florida State hands does enough to prevent that threepoint look Irish trying to improve on a 60 run J dribble kesn catch and release for three Music kesn this is the difference between Notre Dame from a month ago and post callout from coach shuz bear they might be down but the fight is there and theyre never out and all of a sudden weve got a game and it start with that carry Booth put back in all honesty nne is into double digits for the ninth time this season with 11 Watkins a tough shot over J now to set that defense once again try and go turnover chasing there it is shoy trying to tie up Watkins but he may have picked up the foul and he did 53 46 738 to go with a second Music half times they can bleed over to the defensive end its just human nature for 18 to 22 year olds but seeing the ball go in the basket much like it did in the first half kicks the group and all of a sudden theyre locating their blockouts they a little bit better with the basketball theyre communicating a little bit more but again you cant have drop offs like BR Shrewsberry giving the ball back in the front Court in the back court like that and allowing Florida State to make something happen 7 and 12 minutes to go in regulation Florida State led by as many as 14 here in the second half and by four at halftime shot clock at 10 B Bowen boo was working hard on the offensive glass and able to pull into the defensive Rebound in contact made car booth has really provided a jolt for this group here in the second half and hes done it with a fight pretty impressive to see from from a freshman whos not even really come into his own with his body yet but still developing because hes so young but the mentality is there and obviously the skill set hes also a guy capable of making some shots here for the Irish here in the final seven Bo had originally signed at Penn State before coach shwy came here to Notre Dame whos dad who was a hell of Ain a sh you talking about a shop Irish throw it out of bounds into their own bench area and the 12th turnover of the game hes a pretty good NBA executive as well yeah right mind and manager of the Denver Nuggets and the 1998 Defensive Player of the Year Alin Bo at Penn State heres Green close from Applause eyeses Watkins its high level defense from kesan fighting through the screen getting there high level contest and then the Irish re rebound Burton took a tumble and a foul against Florida State and whistle Watkins for his Music third so both teams now in the second half with six team fouls kzne on the inbounds to Burton he leads the way with 14 pz has 11 hes wants it its good offense Burton with the Jordan shake to get into that defense again kick out driving kick just couldnt get the shot green has three at the other end for Florida State hes got 10 now trying to defend Burton what I like about green is he forgets about the last Miss and goes in pursuit of the next make thatll fall in for Burton a little bit of contact there Burton on the drive no Applause call 16 points on six of 10 shooting and a couple of threepointers for Marcus Burton green has two made threes in the game he now has 341 made threes for his career seventh most thr active players in division one that one fumbled and lost to kzne trying to go all the way and he got tied up by Green kesn has to learn the jump stop he has to learn to play off of two now he drew the whistle there hes going fast but if Im a Defender I watch film of him Im saying let him come at me like an out of control locomotive I love The Reckless in which he plays and hes also versatile can step out but get out of control sometimes thats the next step for a very talented piece for the Irish Junior from right here and South Ben one and one cant connect on the front end free throws Music crushing Miller trying to drive it and save it kzne stepping in the passing Lane decisionmaking time again hes driving in a dangerous spots got to be Burton he floated it J got it now a wrestle for the loose ball the arrow favors Florida state that was green who came over to T J still just an eightpoint game kzne to the bench does have three personal fouls 11 points Braden shb just two points so far Jordan one of five shooting after that big 25 Point performance hasnt been the volume from Shrewsberry that weve seen But Shooters are always going to be looking for that next opportunity watch Watkins ji holding his ground but Watkins got it back and he will rock the stanson on the jam only the second offensive rebound of this half for Florida State but its a big one nine points now for Watkins leading scorer this season for Florida State just over 13 per game times has to send it back out quick shot from shury thats got to be a foul they they got that was a hook down low on Kaji the giant Watkins yeah Watkins had him hooked hook and hold down there approaching the fourminute threshold of the second half a 10point lead for Florida State in possession of the ball warley shury able to get the rebound tough Rebound in traffic for the young guard Burton On The Run hanging and scoring thats how you play off of two a power powerful jump stop composure in the air and thats a score wire to score at his best 18 points now for Burton and a critical bucket for the Irish fighting for the board its Applause Music Applause j Burton again putting him on his back and laying it in changing of tempo the burst of speed like a running back in the open field Burton delivering for the Irish and the crowd heck you take a Applause listen Burton now with 20 points time Marcus Burton has the last six points for the Irish and noted a closing the Florida state lead to six as we take a look at our Pacific Life game summary presented by Pacific pafic life creating Financial Security for more than 150 years I I I got to give credit to this Florida State Defense as much as theyve been able to generate some turnovers go the other way its been active hands deflections and blocking shots also that have served as a cattle is to get them going in the open floor and they run like deer everybody can change an end everybody can fill a lane and everybody can finish uh but credit to this the fight the resiliency of this Irish team not to lay down on their home floor weve got a good one buckle up for the final three minutes here in South b seven blocks and eight steals in the game for Florida State they are a second best of the conference in steals theyve got possession right now approaching 3 minutes to go in regulation after leading by four at halftime Burton hit the deck and a foul corn on the on the screen and again credit Bert for the effort if you fight through a screen like that the screener feels like oh I better Shuffle and move to get my body on him and thats when you violate take a look Burt fighting here dashing through and cor absolutely moved he was not supplanted theres trying to get a body on Burton Credit Burton for the effort third foul on Corin for Florida State Himes and Burton in that Irish back court shury there as well joined by ji and rooper Burton On The Run lost the handle out of bounds it will stay with Notre aame hes a cop she a con and together this unlikely Duo makes the perfect pair the CWs brand new showell wild cards premieres this Wednesday January 17th 87 Central right here on the CW got to get one so a timeout taken Notre D we are just continuing the momentum here on CW Courtside Saturday Jordan that we built during the college football season in the ACC as well and were witnessing another spectacular game on the CW and you know what Ive always weary cuz something about the CW and any athletic contest it gets wacky down the stretch theres always a moment it feels like and why not in this one a one that looked very competitive in the first half Florida state with that defensive intensity open it up in the second half but the star the Freshman Phenom that is Marcus Burton singlehandedly willing this group back and its going to come down to can the Irish take care of the basketball can Florida State continue to be in attack mode but some of those lopsided scores we dont have that not here right now yeah Burton has 12 points in the second half North Carolina continues to roll now Virginia really struggling on the road most especially being outscored by 20 is becoming the norm on the road for Virginia wild to see North Carolinas won six in a row 50 in the ACC this is Burton again and had it deflected away said it its going to come down and take care of the basketball here final two and a half thats the fourth turnover for Burton as well so as well as hes played hes kind of had his careless moments so thats the fourth foul on Burton so wattons to the free throw line you cant even flirt with taking Burton out of the ball game final two 244 hes going to have to play Dancing that line Applause 80 on the season for Watkins from the line two of three so far in the game from the Applause strike despite the Miss Watkins is into double digits along with warley and green all have 10 for Florida State Burton with 20 for the fifth time this season and the first time in an ACC game heres your look Shrewsbury its a three hes ripping the ropes for the Irish great set drawn up right there to get your shooter a look its two possession game here with two minutes left Cel Pavilion coming alive late in the game 5955 Florida State Spears big time Big Time off the bounce big time off the bounce from Music Spears he is a scorer closing in on a thousand career points Spears now with 11 hes the fourth player to get the double digits for Florida State shot clock down to 10 for Burton off balance shot able to get it back somehow Shrewsbury again another three credit buron to chase down the loose ball he he couldnt get the first one but again he stays with the play and Shrewsberry whos been quiet Big Time shots for the Irish backto back threes brayon shury threepoint gain its a real shooter forget what whats happened in the first half Im coming out of your fire final minute Spears off the Miller screen he just got in that paint at Jai on his heels spin to win with the float game on 10 13 points for pretty most Spears he hasnt shot a great percentage but right here he gets the exchange he wants he knew ji couldnt dance with him now as hes carving it up into the paint he just had ji lost CL clock kept running they needed to adjust the clock were under one minute adjustment there were going to get back to playing basketball but Spears and Shrewsberry exchanges some Big Time moments offensively 13 for Spears the most for Florida State in this game all the points for shury coming in the second half wants the ball again Burton nne bounces out Watkins high for the board he runs into giant Music shury still in the one and one for Florida State here in fact for both teams told you that four the last five meetings between the teams have been decided by four points or youer expected a close one exactly what we got even though Florida state had gone out to a 14point lead pretty early on they scored the first eight points in the second half led by Ford halftime all right Jordan the biggest stars gathered at the 29th annual Critics Choice Awards hosted by Chelsea Handler tomorrow 7 Eastern 400 pm Pacific on the CW the Critics Choice Awards hosting gigs are Music tough Im sure she will do a fantastic job oh shell knock out yep what a game we have seen between Florida State and Notre Dame both of these teams at this juncture in the season appearing to turn a bit of a corner Florida State winning three in a row all those home games in a row for Florida State they took advantage of that and Notre Dame with its win on the road at Georgia Tech on Tuesday in overtime theyve won three of their last five yeah both these teams have their shortcomings and those shortcomings are are different as opposed to what Florida state has and what Notre Dame has but what you are finding is two teams that are clearly responding to coaching two teams that are markedly improving with each game and look Florida state is on the precipice 38 seconds away from from putting together four game win streak here starting to get healthier its starting to really get that system going now this is the clock so theyre going to probably take some time off here Im going to talk to Roger Applause a froze at 378 but it should not have stopped that early so they tacked off four more seconds roughly to get the clock accurate nine of 11 is a team from the line for Florida State of the Applause game also two teams totally different from the free throw line and how one is weaponized did the other one left a lot of money on the table obviously Florida State the one taking care of business at the charity stri notor aim as a team three of 11 on free throws sixpoint deficit that matters couple of cool free throws from Watkins sevenpoint game here you dont need a three just need something very quick this is slow developing here Florida State looking for its first true Road win of the Year slow developing for sure H shrewbury misses out of the corner he had made his previous two attempts from distance and he has to go commit the foul credit this Florida State team they used their defensive effort and it wasnt necessarily always turnovers but whether it be shot blocks deflections and it gave them the confidence like we said it needs to for them to have a totally different second half percentages from the field almost 10 higher in the second half from the threepoint line 50 from there in the second half look like a totally different team how they came out the final 20 Miller is at the line for Florida state had won five of their previous six games those were all home games and three in a Applause row had a seven game home stand PR come with the South Bend snow frigid temperatures not bothering the guys from Tallahassee coach hams out a heck of a job with this group at this point in time in the season those Rim protectors really made it challenging for driving lanes for this Irish team when they get in there they were very aware of shot blockers potential deflections uh this was a defensive effort to key this noes team to a win here on the road and Florida state with the victory this afternoon eclipsing its win total from a season ago coach Hamiltons team is now 10 and six Notre Dame drops to 7 10 yeah Notre Dames growing this program its its Le
