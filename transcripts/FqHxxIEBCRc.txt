on Pow Black Friday hoops and Durham and away we go duke coming off that win Tuesday here against lell 9566 John sh said he was really happy with the game wellrounded and thought it was the closest theyve had to a 40minute game so far this year in the first five filipowski got his own Miss and then it had poked away and here comes Southern Indiana team off to a 1 in5 start keep an eye on 21 J Smith and 33 Jeremiah Hernandez those are the top two scores for the Screaming Eagles one reason I think sh was so impressed with his team I thought they started last game inside out like they did this first possession it didnt end up well with filipowski scoring but they playing Inside Out was a close big for this team and do you like that I do because they early in the year I thought they started outside in meaning they were perimeter or in it shooting F you know multiple threes to start the game first five out of six possession threes starting inside out just such the time look at the two starters same starting group heres Mark Mitchell who liked Tyrese Proctor John thought had his best game of the season against L out Tyrese Proctor who is shooting a better recently he is hes shooting 38 from behind the ark but I I think his aggressive is the key to this Duke team the more aggressive he is the better he is because hes so unselfish hes not always looking to score there is Sam mvis got Philip kski switched on to him the point guard gives it up to Smith working on the Baseline on a skip for Jack milky and he can shoot it from Deep better than 45 but he comes up empty on his first triple try all right so Proctor whats it look like being aggressive even here the double teams coming he finds the open guy hes already going to make the right decision but just looking to a tack Jared McCain no dice but an offensive rebound on the weak side filipowski says why not and he spun it out Southern Indiana in transition and Jeremiah Hernandez whos got a stroke you like he does I the ball looks good coming out of his hand hes really aggressive he doesnt care if he misses three in a row or makes three in a row hes going to shoot the next one great job by sudden in theana taking advantage of pilowsky falling in the crowd team in just its second year at the division one level coming up from the D2 ranks heres Philip palski done such a good job passing out of the post this year they a really good job inter internally with each other passing the ball and The Cutting big when when Duke throws the ball inside the opposite big is always diving to the front of the rim ched with John sh about an hour and a half ago and that was one of the things he said we have shared the ball very well and thats one of the big places he seen Improvement since the loss here to Arizona the talent is always there this team wont have problems scoring the ball they just got to defend their rebound and share the ball theres milky we told you better than 45 from three 16 for 43 coming in for the six 6 foot 7 J with that high release theyre going to have to make multiple threes tonight if they want to put off the upset they know that they cant grinded inside against D size theres Jeremy roach off the ball screen back iron filipowski battled for it but AJ Smith runs it down and a turnover on the pass underneath all right so we mentioned just the second year at the D1 level for Southern Indiana based out of Evansville Indiana University founded in 1965 started playing basketball 5 years later first at the Nia level then in D2 in the program really took off in the mid90s with Bruce Pearl N9 years as the head coach including that 1995 division 2 National Championship team that the current head coach Stan Gerard was on and starred for KN to miss its a rebound for Kon Music Powell Dukes having a tough time early here tonight mat matching up they getting Cross Match up and they losing theyre not setting their defense and its cost them Five Points here early PO is the trailer in the red chch junor Center the Houston transfer has the lead at three for the Eagles theyre really worried about Duke guards coming off the ball screen so theyre trapping him hard hedging them early filipowski misses now and Duke is two of eight shooting and one5 from three mous trying to turn the corner on Mark Mitchell off the Hedge Smith gave it up and now Hernandez couple of hesitations on roach and spun it out pelowski leads the break Dukes been running more Mitchell to the corner Proctor in and out and the rebound down to mous great job there big men pushing it up in transition is the hardest thing to defend that do another good look for Duke they just havent been able to cash in so far in these first 4 and 12 minutes haris summoned the ball screen not known for his scoring and left it short got his own Miss backs it out heres Smith yes sir great offense you got lucky sometimes ball Falls in your lap and finds you but way to punish the defense there AJ Smith is a talented guy he has the size and the athleticism to make a difference in this game he is spearheaded an 80 run for southern Indiana and then a tip from Applause mvis and a turnover Southern Indiana leads by six and they have knocked down three triples mvis founded and right back out for AJ Smith its bow time part of his 12 years says the head coach at D2 U Indi before taking over at Southern Indiana now in year two of this transition part of a fouryear process to get fully to the D1 level and how about this start for his team at Cameron Jeremiah Hernandez up to five and a 100 run and he said this today it means a lot more when when youre coaching at y mad and you know hes hes accustomed to winning hes not going to accept anything less than that you see that through his team here early in during Caleb Foster Ryan young and Shan Stewart are in Off the Bench for John shy and Young turns it over heres Jordan Tilman leading the break one of their top scorers who comes off the bench averaging double figures and he is always hunting his shot hes a bucket getter hes looking to attack every time he touches it but again thats the third possession his half Duke didnt get back and match up and uncontested layup here on the other end late rotation and now a 120 run for a 1 in5 Southern Indiana team thats only win this year is against division 2 tiffen University Applause here in the defensive end you see Ryan young with his back in and nervous comes and digs it out and gets the transition again late matchup rotations late and theyre punishing Duke mistakes right now and thats what that is theyre just coming out right now Dukes not ready to play yet and theyre just taking advantage of it tyres Proctor to key it in Jeremy roach gets to his spot at the ACC logo and doesnt get the roll Young on the offensive boards well head to the line for a couple amid this slow shooting start for Duke just two of 10 from the floor I think for Coach sh the most disappointing thing right now is is that for Duke you cannot allow your energy level on defense effect by shots going in this team needs to come out defend and then when the shots go you did you did just that much better this team right now relying on the ball to go through the hoop trying to feed off this crowd and when youre not making shots you get this slow start here but theres no excuse not to defend theyve given up seven points just by not coming back and matching up you look at John shy in his second year of course at the helm was really pleased with their defense Tuesday against lound then we chatted with him a little while ago before this game got started he said that the two areas weve improved the most rebounding and valuing the basketball I think the rebounding is the key for this group particularly when you go with the smaller lineups the one game against Arizona they out rebounded by 12 and then theyve come back since then and one the glass the last three games a big part of them winning those last three games Sean Stewart had a chance on the offensive glass after the split from Young so the lead at nine for Southern Indiana Smith off the screen from Nolan cwell 61 fthe senior transferred from Tennessee Tech going to work and he couldnt muscle it over Stewart heres the Freshman Foster around the young screen back for Proctor in post entry young defended by cwell backing him down loves to go to that right hand and R the left to score Scout report you can see cwell sitting on that left shoulder forcing young to turn back with that left hand to finish great job by Ryan Young Chris Carwell told us a few weeks ago we actually did a lefty only workout over the summer with Ryan young trying to work on that that is the scouting report on Ryan young he wants to get to that left should to shoot that righty there is Jack Campion fan favorite guard kick Smith Hoy and comes up empty and he will hear that for the next 32 and A2 Applause minutes I mean Ryan young here gets it in the post and hes just plays just feeling his body gets middle once to spin back great job by Coswell but he just gives up the angle and Brian Young showing you what Ive worked on all off season getting to that left hand hes now nine points away from a th000 for his career between Northwestern and now two years here in durh hes an hes an underrated Defender Im sorry hes underrated Defender also pass handed it off and then cwell got the block on Stewart Smith got out of control Blakes goes diving for it and a held ball will keep it at this end for Southern Indiana you can hear the bench in front of Southern Indiana telling the guys stay home stay home leaving oneonone in the post Coswell comes off great job there blocking that defending the post comes off with the block going Ste it by stay home you mean dont help out on they dont want to help because Ryan young is all when first thing he does is before he goes to shoot just like that he looking for Cutters so they want to stay home on the Cutters enforce him they think that Cosmo length can Music bother theres Campion part of the twoheaded point guard tandem with Sam mvis Smith backs it out out Coswell has got some range thats too strong tipped out by javius Moore seldom used hadnt played the last three games but the fthe senior kept it alive and then Tilman comes up empty cwell trying to rescue it and Duke Applause runs Blakes left alone can knock it down and Duke is one of seven from three duke has had open looks you know they theyve been threepoint already unit this half so far this half but I thought they its come within the floaty offense thats a good shot just did knock it down but they got to continue to defend so you talked early about outside in versus inside out youre okay with the looks even though it is a lot of shots from three right now I Id like it I just would like to like long as the ball touches the paint first you dont want to play just the ball on the perimeter because if you see what southern Indianas doing they theyre attacking the paint more and dribbling and knocking down midrange shots how about Jack Campion the sophomore from Milton Wisconsin only a aages Five Points a game but got to his spot and hit and he restores the Eagles lead to nine Kapowski bangs with Smith duck the shoulder had that roll off the rim more battles with young and itll stay at this end of the floor with Duke when we come back ninepoint Southern Indiana lead at Cameron Indoor Music Applause Stadium three of their first seven but the first one was a transition defensive verb you see there there was confusion on a switch and then his last one is just an offensive rebound and it dont match up again so those are three threes is a npoint difference in the game right now and thats where those nine points is coming from again a program in its second year at the division one level that last year went 16 and 17 went 9 and N in the Ohio Valley Conference in the ovc where this year they were picked nine of the 11 teams there Foster went slashing to the rim and missed it and Southern Indiana pulls it away its a team that has had some close games though you say yeah one and five record but they could have three wins this team very ease should be three wins if not four I mean they had buck nail day was up by 13 and then they only lost by by one against Lile and they feel like they were right there yeah those are in their two most recent games LEL Saturday onepoint loss on the road and then Bucknell Monday had that 13point lead Midway through the first Smith with a neck ball or a wedgie take your play you see a cenal urg see there on Duke better communication contested three there when youre not making shots you got to continue to defend it and as much to be talk about this Duke team I think everyone forgets this still a relatively young group of guys outside of Jeremy roach and Ryan young this is a young group we got Foster and McCain the two freshman out on the floor with the twotime captain roach and then the sophomores Mitchell and filipowski and its a scoreless Dr of more than three minutes for Duke Foster on the rip through had the advantage on Campion hes been so good coming off the bench for Dukes so steady himself comes in giving him offense giving him solid own ball defense as well Smith around the screen from Moore and a dribble hand off for Campion the left he moves it Moore hoists it and hits how about the minutes from javius Moore guy who hadnt played the last three games hes got his first points of the season and again another three and they know they know they got to get knock down close to 12 13 threes if they want to pull off the upset here Jeremy Kane comes out closes out short Morris telling him you better get out here guard me javius Moore fifth year senior from Mississippi who spent four years in the junior college ranks in Southwest Mississippi and now in his first year at Southern Indiana Kyle filipowski got fouled by Kon pal and misses on the first last couple of games for filipowski just 40 combined minutes John sh said postgame Tuesday wasnt quite himself in the first half but shy thought filipowski really responded well in the second half with an ankle that was swollen CH told his pregame he is 100 but filipowski misses both well we know sh isnt 100 we can tell by the way he sounded yeah hes fighting a bug a little youre always fearful of that as a coach because you dont want to give it to your players Smith going to work matched up with Foster Moore drives on Mitchell forced into a tough shot Mitchell clears it Mitchell fancy dribbling sees the opening and Mark Mitchell gets fouled doing it all himself thats always a concern when your bigs rebound and push you know because guards have to stop the ball you get in Cross matchups and thats what happened there committing a foul Dukes exceptionally dangerous when filipowski also snatches rebounds and push him and when these two guys he and Mark Mitchell get together rebound well and push the break Dukes incredibly difficult to stop in transition Mitchell 76 at the line for his career hey tomorrow 1100 am eastern the ACC huddle crew gets you set for another afternoon of football and then at 630 get a complete ramp up of those games as they get you set for the big Prime Time match up between a couple of eight and three teams here on accn at 8 Eastern after the game a full postgame show to wrap up the night all right here on ACCC Network and of course the ESPN app Mitchell makes B its down to eight with 9 minutes to go in this first half at Cameron Indoor Stadium B Star and extended press little but pick it up 94 ft Champion Baseline drop off for Smith and he gets the roll and John sh seen enough he is barking at Mark Mitchell and his Blue Devils and needs a timeout team to step slow defensively right Applause now 10point lead for Southern Indiana in the first Music half there he is its right there oh hes straight go go go cover more ground in the Kia Sportage Turbo Hybrid Kia movement that Applause inspires how about staner ards group here in Durham theyre feeling comfortable right now they feeling them feeling at home I mean coming off the screen here Duke no communication defensive laps there McCain steps out hes late knock down to three in here back door cut and just not ready L just sleep walking right now on the defensive end and theyre paying for it 8 and a half to go until halftime for the blue doubles filipowski turns the corner on Powell and gets fouled so second foul on the big man Kon Powell will plant filipowski back to the free throw line I think filipowski and that time would like to keep that and finish with his left hand he had pal Lunas right side and went to the up I think if he keeps that in his left hand he gets the a one I dont think theres a shot block on the floor right now for Southern Indiana passs good on the first so pal exits with his two fouls and Nolan cwell fifth year Senior comes in to replace him they feel comfortable with their bigs being able to come in you see p get in foul trouble and they feel comfortable with Coswell coming in and also HD will come in as a third be so they feel like they got enough 15 fouls to give to Philip Housey if he starts to hurt them inside part of the reason why Stan Gerard is pretty stringent if you pick up two fouls in the first half according to kenpom doesnt have a lot of leniency with you Campion on a tough step back that he hits he jumps out on film hes just so active and involved on both sides of the ball for these guys roach underneath with an answerer and then the turnover and Jared McCain Cashes in and four quick ones for Duke just that quick four quick points for Duke theyre extending that pressure theyre going to have to turn it up on the defensive end and now Camerons getting into it Hernandez searching for something moves it to milky now the point guard Campion tend to shoot hes got Mitchell on it off the crossover bounces for Smith oh thats pretty great basketball there trouble penetration getting in the paint finding guys on the weak side and another threepoint make thats five of them now for USI the lapowski just muscles cwell theres no answer for that we can do that all night I think cwell the closest thing they have is someone to being able to affect his shot and Philip palski just showed you there hes no matching side just too physical strong his first bucket comes about 13 minutes in see herandez disc as well theres so much confusion in the ball defense pror pushes shovels for Roach The Shot fake roach driving couldnt get it to go and cleared by Moi all right explain that oh the what watch when the ball screens coming interactions that when youre talking about switching you want to be early and often meaning if I know Im switching calling out early switch switch switch switch Duke is so late two guys are ding the ball or two guys are going away double comes Smith got his Miss and then had it poked Away by McCain proor in transition gets it back from roach theres Mitchell on the Block faces up on milky Mitchell spinning off glass no oh Mitchell had a reason to be upset there I thought he got his arm hooked up when he tried to spin back Baseline now Campion tries to orchestrate USI into its offense and under six to go in this first half leading by seven couldnt get it to Smith so instead the shooter milky now Smith five to shoot heres Campion hes got Mitchell on him Campion a step back oh and he hit that too heat check going on now with Campion guy who had one division one scholarship offer from a team that only now is D1 as filipowski responds for Duke thats the danger when you come out slow like this for a team thats not a great threepoint shooting team but theyre shooting 54 from behind YK right now six May threes already and if they want to pull off this upset theyre going to need to make about 12 to 13 three theyre halfway there now theres Hernandez spinning on trying to muscle to the rack and he Applause does thats seven for Jeremiah Hernandez lead back to 10 and if he gets going hes another problem because hes a score as well picking pop filipowski cant connect and Duke is one of eight from threepoint range threepoint shots falling on one side and not for the Blue Devil here at home Campion finds milky moved for Hernandez driv it on McCain with a scoop no Philip pasy the rebound even though they missed a shot theyre still getting to the rim relative ease the pasy Watson youve been calling for this taking it at cwell again got his Zone Miss Philip howski met by Coswell cwell is up to the challenge right Applause now inside a four to go in the first half one and five southern Indiana up by 10 on the number nine team in the country heres milky cant knock it down Philip palowsky another rebound huge lucky there milky is the best threepoint shooter on his Southern Indiana team got a wide open look there Mitchell slipped it and Mitchell scores it Stan Gerard wants a timeout sensing some tired legs perhaps with three and a half to go how about the threepoint shot for the Eagles alarm emojis being fired off around the country right now in the college basketball world with what we have seen the first 17 minutes of this game Duke has not played well against Southern Indiana trailing by eight here getting late in the first half see sh blue GL was come out extending their defense here and look at the group thats on the floor Jaden Blakes is their best on ball Defender got proed there Foster gets out to the defensive end and I think Ryan young is one of their better bigs from a positional defensive standpoint theyre picking up their intensity here and just hounding Southern Indiana into a turnover we had Cruise pass one media timeout we go right into another 34 to go duke down eight at home against USI Dorothy who were those hes balling here in dur he is I think hes upset he lost he didnt start the game because we started a couple of games early with the midrange going left step back going right and here just have some with the Deep three there only averages Five Points a game got a quick seven this half he is a gamer hes quick hes crafty giv the Blue Devils fits here early in the first throughout the first half here and Duke trying to storm back as Foster drives and got fou less than three to go until halftime this a Southern Indiana team that again if youre just tuning in maybe see him to score theyre in their second year as a D1 program theyre one and five this tonight is the first ACC team theyve ever played theyve defeated one power five program in history that was in 1991 against Wisconsin but USI was division 2 at the time what they been been here theyve been in North Carolina for 9 days on the road I should say for 9 days so they practice Wednesday at NC State they didnt practice yday here Thanksgiving here at D safe to say they F at home well Thanksgiving dinner at The Pit in Raleigh yesterday Sean got the offensive rebound off to miss at the line and now Foster slashes hangs in the air and missed it another offensive rebound spurred by Stewart great job there just attacking in paint look forun enough to get another offensive rebound heres the pressure theyre extending their pressure J Blakes picks up a foul about 70 ft away from the cut Onis just a great drive there off balance there Stewart does a great job being active on the glass and Foster comes back and get the Finish again how about the job Sean Stewarts done these last few games John CH said to his pregame hes our best rebounder hes their best athlete as well and I think he gives them something that this team doesnt have a great job of and thats size and athleticism this group right now the last couple of possessions has given the effort John chs been wanting to see in a frustrating first half sh should be extremely disappointing neck HD went pivoting to his left and then Foster rescues it on the Baseline and turns it over theres Campion shovels to Hernandez on the Baseline through some contact no hle the offensive rebound Smith drives kicks they move it hit a hoist and air balls in and Proctor drives a foul on Jack campia I think of all the stats and everything thats happened this game that foul just a possession to go was Dukes first foul on the defensive end you know and thats got to be disappointing cuz you got to be close enough to foul someone you know when theyre shooting the ball this way and Duke hadnt just been physical and aggressive yet on the defensive end I think theyve relied on it came out relying on their offense and they shot the ball poorly early and find themselves in the game and then maybe it did become a little more settling for threes and then the defense you had mentioned picking up in transition and defending ball screens they were they were just slow their communications been off theyre a little slow for whatever that reason may be but I know sh isnt happy about it at all Foster goes slashing again young cleans it up with another offensive rebound for Duke burrowing down low and he gets the roll he sending a message to his group because he s of these guys hes put his five five of his more competitive guys and Defenders out there and just say go out there and compete well figure to score out later roach filipowski Mitchell they all sit here closing down the the first half for two its a onep possession game mous with nowhere to go H the hand off heres Smith hes got eight in this first half got to get it up and Smith draws back iron Foster clears it Proctor in transition Proctor lost his footing and is called for traveling violation the best of defensive possession of the game right there for Duke Im okay with with anything getting in the paint getting this deep playing physical May kick it out but if not youre okay getting a the glass Ryan Youngs in there battling like I said hes one of their better positional Defender he is their best low low post offensive weapon and you can see coach sh here just putting guys out there just sayy you defend you play hard you get out there right now sending a message so a couple starters there and Duke has only now pulled even in total rebounding margin at 20 a piece with Southern Indiana Foster whistled for a foul on the perimeter against Hernandez at least this group is closeing enough the foul sh is okay with that he didnt worry about foul trouble yet this half Stan Gerard meanwhile his group up by three told you they played Michigan State who at the time was ranked fourth in the country in the second half of that game they played him completely even 37 37 was the second half score against the Spartans they also play St Louis who is a very physical team that switches everything so theyve had this style style of Defense theyve seen it already in a high major program shot clock winding down on Sam mvis he kicks Smith Jacks Applause connects AJ Smith hes up to 11 to go along with nine rebounds in this first half but look at the penetration here yeah you gets in the middle of the defense paint and if he doesnt get it theres one more pass there for an open three duke just seems to be a step slow on a defensive end Southern Indiana had been averaging six made threes a game theyve got seven here already in the first half at dke cuz what you need to pull off the upset youre going to have to get close to 15 threes the p is upset off and theyre halfway there doctor driving in the final seconds with a scoop much needed for Duke to head to halftime who saw this coming Southern Indiana up by four tyres Proctor I think this team will rise obviously in the camp on rankings but they feel comfortable about where they are on the season they feel like theyve had some losses slip away l in some games and if their guard play is strong they feel like theyre going to be do really well in their lead starting group is back out there for John Shire to begin the second half it was a lot of the reserves on the floor who got it to within four playing with Tyrese proor as well mous dropped it off and then pal had it blocked by filipowski mvis took it back to Hernandez those guys sa for the final 329 filipowski roach Mitchell and McCain Hernandez with a miss and Duke can trim it to one possession Applause again hares pror off to Jared McCain knocks it down and its a onepoint game great start there by D coming off the ball screen Tyrese Proctors one of the best picking point guards in the country comes off find Jared McCain on on a shake up knock Downs the Applause three Sam mous trying to set up a ball screen from pal heres Hernandez one of the top two scorers for Southern Indiana the other is this guy AJ Smith who had the 11 and N in the first half thats a tough two Dukes got it they havent LED since it was 53 roach off the bounce and roach got fouled youre seeing Duke when they at their best getting a rebound driving and transition and finishing and here heres the ball screen here hes reading Philips man he tags knows he has McCain lifting up in the corner knocks down to three I think hes the best threepoint shoot on the team so its always a good idea to find him as well and another one of The Talented freshman on is Duke roster he made seven threes over the last two games coming into tday so a tied at thir 5 after Duke trailed an unranked nonconference opponent at halftime at Cameron for the first time since 2011 Davidson a game that Duke did go on to win 8269 and roach has it roll out that was about to jinx a m the first lead in a while and missed the free throw we said not since 53 dke came back with a lot of this extended pressure and and they force a 10c count on Southern Indiana I think the most compelling deal of the first half was Duke only committed two fouls and he sent a message to four of his starters he sat him down he didnt play the last 3 and A2 minutes and those fouls didnt happen until those guys went to the bench so if you felt something shaking in durm that was the halftime speech of Coach shy there I guess so had to wake his guys up his number n team of the country four and one on the threegame winning streak it started against Michigan State following the loss to Arizona McCain with post entry for Kyle filipowski banging underneath and a chance at three and Dukes got the lead great job there finding a big fella inside attacking inside out not outside in they coming out early in the first second half here drops it inside and theres just nobody can guard they have no one to block the shots too small pile just not big enough and theyre going to go to him until cwell comes in Pals out with his third foul so here comes cwell and Kyle filipowski to the free throw line I think Coswell is the only guy that has the length to really bother filipowski inside hes giving up a few pounds but he does have the limp to bother himy couldnt Stamp It Battle on the boards Mitchell and mous and a tie up keeps it at this send to the floor in addition to the defensive pressure sure seemed like Duke got back into it with more aggression on the offensive glass well we talked about the opening is just that sometimes they settle too much too many jump shots not enough touches in the paint either off the drive or the post UPS you can see early here in the second half they go early to filipowski inside on the post up Id expect roach the Kaine and pro that to get him in pain off the Applause drible roach navigating the pick and roll with Philip psky for Metro and now can Southern Indiana handle this trailing and with Cameron a little more charged up right now and Duke playing better with momentum Hernandez tough shot that one rolls off Smith and Hernandez have taken some tough ones Proctor pushing he kicks McCain Rises got it this is the way the Blue Devils want to play Turn defense in the offense they came out slow in the first half theyre coming out aggressive in the second half on his defensive man to the floor Applause Music here Mitchell Aslam McCain a three 11 zip in the the ball movement playing unselfish and of course defending the basketball again they extend pressure nearly another 10second count on Southern Indiana and now has to set up its offense halfway through the shot clock with mous directing Mitchell is the one hounding AJ Smith 21 bottom right corner of your screen Hernandez much easier this time at the cup here coming off theres Tyrese proor in that ball screen with filipowski that they use so well on Tuesday and they led the points filipowski took some contact from cwell again still in the game for Music Applause pal Smith off a screen comes to get it Coswell the veteran on the Block offensive foul yeah he may not like the call but hes entitled to his position you cant move him cant go through his chest anymore you used to be entitled to bump you got one bump in the pass no longer the case hes entitled to that spot leaning to it with his shoulder filipow obligers goes down and gets the call no that Coswell is still smiling about it g up Court fivepoint Duke Applause lead Proctor trying to cross up camp roach open to hit largest lead for Applause two the pressure of Duke extending like that once Southern Indiana gets across half court they dont have a ton of time late shot clock here at eight for Smith Campion to the corner got it back from Hernandez now milky in and out cleared by filipowski and now down on the floor thats AJ Smith hes been one of if not the best player for Southern Indiana so far this year we will check on AJ Smith when we come back to Applause Cameron Illinois and its good to see him up and moving on the sideline and walking around this is what happened 21 in red yeah you dont know what happened just comes down and grabs his C and hes such an important piece for this team guy who last year played just six minutes per game scored less than two points per game sat behind some really good players and had to wait his turn Stan Gerard city was a little impatient but he had a great summer great preseason and for a guy who was actually in the transfer portal after last season but decided to return hes been outstanding for USI about the spin from Philip palowski wow great spin move no double team coming filipowski is telling Cosell block this Kyle filipowski got a double double Campion trying to separate from roach and gets a foul called on Jeremy roach faces him up so he gets him off his body and just drives and spins on him and I think he needs to do that more in a post instead of playing with his back to the basket tur and face that means the defense has to get his hands off him allows him to use his skill set and I think hes most skill seven footer in college basketball hon pow comes back in probably to try to defend Philip Kowski even though hes got those three fouls here he is on the Block and he gets fouled by Mark Music Mitchell Mar Mitchell you always tell your Defender you want him to be the second guy to jump came over late in the rotation hes picked it up on both ends of the floor as well I think hes their most versatile Defender hes able to guard one through five Pals on the first hey what a week 133 ACC Network football lineup weve got for you tomorrow starts in new Eastern with pit against Duke whos dropped four out of five trying to get back on track then Virginia Tech trying to get bulll eligible against Virginia then Carolina and NC State battle eight and three teams at 8 Eastern MIT such a key cog in this team and where this season can go for two and they all bring something special to the group N bigger than this guy right here hand off from turn to Applause filipowski again navigating the pick and roll Tyrese proactor setting it up for Duke Campion nearly lost it has some space and itss another maybe hes more comfortable on balance he is just so crafty hes quick and hes crafty he gets to his spots Proctor look at that dish Mitchell too strong main goes battling on the offensive boards and a tie up and the arrow favors the other way I mean tyres Proctor in the pick and roll Tuesday weve already alluded to this but he was so effective and John sh said afterward I remember watching him in high school thinking this guy is a wizard in pick and roll and John sh felt like every time they went pick and roll the other night they got a wide open shot you do his vision is unreal I I think its just its just superpower I I think thats the thing that he does better than just about anybody in the country he gets to his spots he sees everything on the floor and for what he brings on the defensive end of the floor he spends a lot of energy I knit pick with him but I wanted him to be more aggressive on the offensive end but hes really a complete player over and back CS Tillman hadnt established himself in the front Court well you look at points per possession pick and roll operators the the guy controlling off the pick and roll and who are the most efficient in the pick and roll in the ACC according to Synergy tyres Proctor is top two in this league he is behind but but junr their character the pit freshman has just been unbelievable in what hes shown so far but I I think Tyrese is just the most complete guard in his league is not the country um really underrated defensively but if he takes on the toughest assignments against bigger wings and guard Music thats high prise no he is hes fun to watch off the bounce way shot clock roach Jing hits Jeremy roach says weve been weve been too much talk about Ty Rees Brock like dont forget about Applause me the seniors got eight playing in his 101st career game and this pressure forces another 10c count second one of Southern Indiana paired with an over and back at the midcourt stripe and Dukes pressure calling causing all sorts of problems for the Eagles just completely disruptive Jeremy Rose stopping the ball there just above half court Creed that turn over there Kosar may keep his voice after all I thought he was going to lose it for the way he sounded in warm ups better second half dke Foster attacks Proctor off the crossover on Campion proor starting to feel it cant have got a piece of it three to shoot heres roach and he Applause hits Dukes out scored Southern Indiana 23 three to five in the second half Champion bounces for pal and he jams on Stewart now tyres practor is slow to get up for Duke this is what I talked about earlier and some of the mistakes that was happening when as a guard when you run into a screen like that you just didnt know it was there and I know its loud the crowd is cheering but thats part of what the next step with this young group you got to communicate the screens coming tries to get over and just gets nailed there by pow so Proctor departs with 1242 to go well keep an eye on that here in the second half for now its Foster Blakes roach filipowski and Stewart and roach turns it over Camp be Off to the Races couldnt lay it in over Stewart and and then last Touch by The Eagles Campion would like to have that back he has zero chance of making that shot against Stewart with his ticism chasing him down great job by the Freshman coming in aling that shot what do you do as a guard here Ill pull that back out look at that he tried to volleyball Spike that got a little lucky there he hit the Rim Yeah I think he jumped so high the referee probably thought he hit it on his head so they did call it a gold they did yeah he hit the rim great call and two points for a Campion hes up to 11 10point margin coming up on 12 to Applause go roach trying to shake Smith and roach is fouled again its a notable difference when Proctors not in the other guards dont come off the ball screen as much and I I tend to say press they dont press the big making the big stay and hold it just forces some rotation these guys are coming off they too quick to give up the ball and thats what makes him so special he just puts so much pressure on your defense how do you press a big well of his size when he comes off hes coming off and he doesnt allow his Defender to get in between him and the B so hes tight tos tight coming off and he stays in front of that big because as a Defender as a big youre taught let my guard get back in front Tyrese proor doesnt let his Defender get back in front so he holds the big the other big rolls he puts your weak side defense in so much trouble and he just his vision to find an open guide is invaluable to this Dukes team Jeremy roach makes both hes got 13 points to lead all Duke players leads a Applause dozen Southern Indiana has as many turnovers as made baskets out of halftime and that is not the shot St wanted Dukes up by 12 they are rolling in this second half against Southern Indiana Dorothy who were those fellas Nolan Richardson court at the bud won Arena be buzzing when they get there good news we just heard about Tron Mark who played so well this week and in the game today for Arkansas against North Carolina that hes been released thankfully from a local hosital hospital and had an MRI which showed no significant injury to his back and he is going to be allowed to travel back to fville along with his teammates tomorrow morning great news great news so well see what his status is of course Wednesday against Duke thats when things really pick up for the Blue Devils then next weekend theyve got ACC action better offensive rebound for Duke up by 14 good sign for Southern Indiana 21 in red AJ Smith is back into the game after grabbing at that left leg Foster attacks and scores by the way they took off the two points that they had given to Jack Campion and they ruled that there was no basket interference and so we ping pong on that potential two points and instead of 44 its 42 and then three more javius Moore with his second triple Mo said I got I got it back dont worry Applause confident young man off the bench for Southern Indiana Midway through the second out roach off the crossover driving dis Foster and weak side rebound hauled in by Campion what do you want to see from Southern Indiana here I think they got to get back to spreading the floor out opening the court up a little bit they got to handle do a better job of handling Dukes pressure they did a great job early of driving gaps kicking the threepoint shooters its Stewart on Campion nowhere to go Stewart can guard all sorts of positions for you shot clock at seven he shuts off Campion again more on the Applause Baseline roach quickly back the other way Jus Mo with eight points guy who hadnt scored this year in 23 minutes of Applause action hes playing well hes showing you what hes capable of and another weapon for this team offensive floor extra pass roach can knock it down and the rebound to Smith so Smiths got a double double and then Camp the length of the halfcourt feed to Kon Powell down to single digits now and Southern Indiana within nine with still N9 and 1 half to go here at Cameron Indoor Stadium Music defense and the offense and this is what you see here they created Five turnover so far here in the second half and 10 seconds count the pressure and once that you dont see is that they sped him up a bunch and took a lot of quick shots which are just as effect of his turnovers thiss a 70 run the last 90 plus seconds for Southern Indiana Proctor back into the game behind the back and Mitchell had it blocked at The Rim by pal Mitchells got to get his right shoe back on so five on four in the meantime C be in back iron long rebound out to Hernandez and a fresh 20 Foster gets switched on to Campion Hernandez with a burst Hernandez off the hesitation couldnt score it offensive rebound and Po got bumped on the Baseline and a f is called on Jared McCain just some confusion again there with the de Dukes week side defense if youre switching theres no need to rotate and I think the freshman Jered McCain that time was late no need for him to help he did and he was late on his clothes out and gave up a middle midd drive Applause there Southern Indiana has hung around despite Dukes best efforts here at of halftime for just joining us Southern Indiana led by for it the break Champion backs out filipowski now driving on the sevenfooter with a scoop that rolls off and Proctors got the Applause rebound Caleb Foster trying to scoop it up and he gets fouled by Jack Campion K Foster does a great job when he comes in and attacking the basket he does settle for threes big big guard big lead guard is 65 uses his length his Music size freshman from Harrisburg North Carolina was ranked number 22 in our ESPN 100 had the big game against Michigan State in the Champions classic hey heres your lineup for the ACC SEC men and womens basketball challenge first on Tuesday night for the men its Mississippi State Georgia Tech at 7 Eastern then at 915 Georgia Florida State then on Wednesday for the women its Florida Georgia Tech at 5 Eastern and fandy against number 10 NC State at 715 and you can catch all the action from those games right here on accn and of course on the ESPN now so foster good on both and The Talented freshman has the lead back in double figures for the Blue Devils good pass by Moore Smith was thinking poster palsky had other ideas Duke runs heres proor C connects Southern Indiana now trying to contr control the pace of the game Dukes in is switching lineup expect him to attack Philip palsky and try to drive him on the switches he drops on mous and stays with cwell now Proctor switches on to Smith and filipowski gets t for a foul its his second 737 to go second half D leads by 11 now they got they welome Tennessee to town and Carolina team is is really talented and still trying to find itself a reminder hour game here just part one of a double header of mens Hoops on acc Network as Smith out whistled for a foul there no theyre going to say its on Nolan cwell instead and an offensive foul against Southern Indiana but Clemsons coming up against alorn State Clemson off to a 40 start theyve got some solid mid major wins in there and PJ Hall is averaging about 20 a game I I think that team is really talented and Id be Id be surprised if theyre not finishing in the top four in this league and its all said and done they experience back SP obviously PJ Hall inside they got dep first that group with hard fall and hes a little bit slow to get up after he got fouled at The Rim its on of cwell again his Music third hes got a right leg caught up its funny bone Hall you see him shaking arm there good thing hes got that pad on his elbow helps pushing the blow a little bit there still shaking it out at the stripe weve seen duok a few times early on these first few weeks of the season I think back to the conversation we have with John sh about Kyle filipowski about filipowski decision to return he told us that I dont think Kyle filipowski could handle the Tennessee game being his last game ever in college he said that yeah he said that because I wondered if it was the hip surgery that made him come back he didnt go because he wasnt sure if he was healthy he said no if he was completely healthy he would have come back and he he loves Duke he loves everything about it and I think he wants to leave his mark on a historic program he knows what the talent level that they have and for him his mindsets on trying to win an National Championship John CH said it to us hes just a different dude he said thats the type of guy that makes that decision and maybe not other guys like him that would and we said Hows he different said I dont know hes a 39 student if that tells you anything and yeah fired up about the way last year ended in the second round of the NCAA tournament in most programs your program Rises and and drops off of a guys decision like his its Duke obviously but he he values his legacy I think I think its important to him to do something special in his Duke uniform smth driving right at Philip pisu rips down another rebound hes got a dozen of Applause them were talking about a guy that was a third ranked player in his class coming in ends up as a freshman being their best play proor and Applause one wow look at the back door cut finishes strong I think hes a little bit upset he thought he might have tried to undercut him a little bit not knowing he just lost his Applause balance tyres Proctor with something to say to javius Moore after Moores foul and Proctors slam on the give and go with Kyle filipowski and the officials Ted Valentine Mark Schnur and Jamal Spearman will look at the monitor Philip Tyrese brocker gu up grabbing his head I think he was telling you official he got when he tried to block it he hit him in the Music head back door cut there passed by Philip Music hsky another Music look see a slap there so the initial foul you got from Moore obviously a foul perhaps consideration to it being upgraded and then Proctor just kind of grabbing on as he comes down and then hovering over JVS Moore as well sort of three parts to that play hes got to be careful with that they called the foul so you know they saw it but if you go up and you start that could be taken as taunting and you dont want to get any hes a guy whos already shown in a couple of years that hes hes not afraid to exchange words sometimes no hes allowed hes hes a tough guy hes got hes hes got a feist about him and but as a leader of this team and as a captain you dont want to show that you want to you in difficult moments you want to show the guys that youre cool and calm under pressure and he has so much responsibility on his shoulder cuz like I said hes in a hes a big time Defender I I dont think people understand how good of a Defender he is and at times I nitpick about him because I want him to be more aggressive even Kosar wants him to be more aggressive on the offensive end that doesnt necessarily mean him shooting it it just means hes such an elite passer he takes care of the basketball so well you want guys like that to continue to be aggressive see if they assess of flagrant here I think if to anyone itd probably be on the initial more foul no I agree you could you could do I mean you could call it depends on they got an angle that shows maybe if he was hitting the Music head after a lengthy look from Ted Valentine and Jamal Spearman the officials now confer with Mark schner and the drama builds at Cameron with 629 to go got to show TV Teddy now we got to make sure I got Ted Valen timee is gets it right now we Music cant hes one of the long time great officials in this league and been around for a while well respected and its not many better than T Valentine I can tell you that one of my Music favorites we will await word from down at floor level up to us in the Crows Nest here at Cameron and looks like tyres practor disbelieving of whatever Ted Valentine just told John shy Jus Mo doesnt seem to mind too Applause much and Jeremiah Hernandez is getting ready to shoot free throws for Southern Indiana yeah so it sounds like what has been assessed is a flagrant one on javius Moore for the foul of tyres Proctor on the dunk and then a dead ball technical foul to tyres Proctor for standing over and presumably for the taunting of jius Applause Music Moore see the blow here to to the head there ladies and gentlemen prev fou on SP has been upgraded to a one there also F on number five so Hernandez will shoot first again the Baseline for a flagrant one is just excessive in nature Andor unnecessary and that seems to fit the definition on Moores foul I think the officials got it Applause right fair and the taunting called on Proctor and Proctor took the blow to the head which led to the n one so Proctor now gets two free throws here after Hernandez got his Applause Applause two so 6551 is the Duke lead with 629 to go after no blood effectively on those four free throws and possession as well remember two free throws and possession for a playgr Applause one I think you call that too to get a get control of the game you dont want any emotions to get out of control here you get hit in the head you stand over a guy want to make sure everybodys under control got their emotions in check and now were ready to go need a warm up after that and its more on Proctor Proctor turns the corner dishes for Mitchell underneath rebound to Applause Smith its mvis Coswell Smith Moore and Hernandez the five out there for Stan Gerard in Southern Indiana heres Moore oh its going up no doubt about that hes knocked down a couple of Threes tonight he taught me Im going to go back at you hes got 11 his first 11 points in a Southern Indiana uniform for the Mississippi native who celebrated each bucket today all four of them including three triples filipowski the offensive rebound and stick Applause back 15 points 13 rebounds to go along with three assists for Kyle filipowski Hernandez trying to shake McCain and now Smith on Mitchell to the corner mvis WS Itor out more too strong this time and itll stay at this end with Southern Indiana this a great just a great find there lazy close out there by Proctor and mo is like you just dunked on me Im Im going to trade you two for one here I mean three for two here McCain just misses the shot filipowski just follows it up and theres just no answer for him inside Philip poy get whatever he wants Mo finds pal just back into the game thats another one of those Duke mixup defensively Philipi staying home at the five but under 8 seconds they switched the ball screen guard didnt get that switch Philip Houses man get the basket run filipowski on off the screen and Philip palski tried to get pal in the air and a foul eventually called I think the right call was made one official below didnt have the angled on it thats why the late whistle but you can see his arms were down and its the fourth foul on Kon pow two shots for Kyle Music filipowski only three of seven at the line tonight hey tomorrow at 1100 am eastern the ACC huddle crew gets you set for an afternoon in football and then at 630 its a complete wrap up of those games and getting you prep for Prime Time accn 8 Eastern State Carolina then after the game a full postgame show to wrap up the night all of it right here on accn and the Music app see if Duke comes out and extends their pressure here and really try to put an exclamation mark on this game roach shadowing mous you see the ball screen defense now they no theres Philip housei staying home now L the clock are going to switch here and Hernandez got to the rim and will shoot two drawing the foul on filipowski is third so different ball screen defenses theres drop coverage theres hedging theres switching take us through a little a primer a little intro course on it you the keys is for them is Duke is trying to protect Philip palski as they go forward because if not youre going to have to attack him because you know hes so important to the team so originally Duke is trying to first ball screen that they ran he just you know he went under this time he comes out hard he switches it and you dont want to make a putting him one on you know oneonone against a guard or a Applause wing because you dont want to that risk there a foul they throughout the year theyre going to have to try to figure out a way you got to mix up your coverages for one but you got to protect that guy he is the one guy thats invaluable to the to the team we were told before the season that they would play filipowski a lot in what they call blue which is like hedge and touch a little bit but its not a super hard hand right just so he can recover because for one they have rebound concern so they want to keep filipowski on the other teams big so hell come out this initial screen here you can see him playing off hes hedging now hes getting back to his man no ball screen this time a mous floater drops down first points of the day for Sam mvis the senior point guard whos only got eight points now all Applause season hes seen the job and Jack camp on has done and hes trying to pick up his offensive output still an 11point game with 345 five to Applause go Mitchell faces up it wanted him to attack and he does and draws a foul and get the foul on AJ Smith Mark Mitchell to the line when we come back to Durham at Marshalls our buyers hustle every day to of east west and then home next weekend to host Bowling Green in year two at the D1 level before a conference play at the end of December in the Ohio Valley Conference yeah coach D was a little bit disappointed at his team he says he tries to go 500 in out of conference nonconference games and they havent scheduled lightly with St Louis and Michigan State here in Cameron this game isnt open they represented themselves well yeah Mark Mitchell missed both so that has left the door a jar for the screening Eagles inside a three and half to go second half action to Cameron mvis off to Moore has made a whole lot of friends here in Durham he goes driving lost it Smith retrieves it roach switches on to him for to shoot Smith long two back iron Smith slow to get up to his feet he goes tumbling and Duke slows things down Foster Proctor roach Mitchell and filipowski the five out there to finish for John shy watch the ball screen run up by filipowski here he sets it for foster who snakes it attacks had it poked Away by Smith and it stays with Duke with six to shoot Jack Campion coming back into the game and he replaces Sam Applause Music mvis look for roach here coming out BR sets the screen then was trying to get it instead filipowski spinning and banging and heading off glass yeah there theres p is just too small for him he once he gets an angle you cant affect Philipi shot 19 and 13 for Kyle filipowski how could Coral it filipowski has it picked Hernandez LS it in kows upset with himself over that turn over thought he thought he had numbers on the other Applause end team High 15 for Jeremiah Hernandez and John shy takes the timeout with 207 to Music go all right big picture for Duke trying to get a fourth consecutive win before we told you they go to Arkansas on Wednesday and then that early ACC conference game weve had that the last few years will be at Georgia Tech next weekend where do you think Duke is at now six games into the season theyve improved I I I think this is the type of game they were coming in they were heavily favored and they slept walk through the first half of the game and it gave shy some five power against these guys to get him motivated because they got to get ready theyre heading into Arkansas Arkansass coming off two losses in a row and theyre at home I I think Arkansass mindset is that we have to win this game and that Arena this is the first true Road game for the Blue Devils so you dont know how these guys are going to respond particularly the freshman and the younger guys in that environment which is one of the best in college basketball so therell be a big big test coming up for the Blue Devils its coming to Wednesday night for John shy and his team late night from fville a reminder if youre tuning in looking for Clemson against alorn State we will get you to Little John Coliseum as soon as were done here at Cameron Indoor Stadium to see if Clemson can stay perfect in the nonconference part of the schedule out of the gates against the zone now Duke navigates that and roach couldnt connect add it around and Mitchells got it Luke is so hard to Zone because they have many shootings but more importantly so many guys that can find guys and and really good passers and nothing better than the gu with the ball in his hand proor pick and roll so smooth thats what were talking about just I think hes one of the best pick and roll guys we showed the graphic of it but thats what Im talking about you dont stop the ball he punishes you at the rim with his size and his ability to finish at The Rim his floaters in midrange hernandz short and coming up on the final minute thats off to Southern IND the they battle tonight and they LED at the half here against D Smith fouls Foster absolutely no reason to be disappointed here South Indiana violent effort they wont be the last team to come in indoor Cameron and walk out of here with an L but they destroyed the spread I mean great job coming in competing this team was leading at the half and Duke stirred to life finally in the second half after trailing at the break and they came out they ramped up the defensive pressure at the end of the first half carried that over into the second half and they really got after Southern Indiana Defender Char wont be happy with the performance but hell take the win and I think he knows he is giving him all the ammunition he needs to get them ready to play at Arkansas cuz itll be the toughest game I think that they played all year Kowski the putback gets him up to 21 points and we hit the final minute cool moment for Southern Indiana in Stan Gerard who empties the bench here give some guys a chance to set foot on the floor at Cameron indor yarin Hassan the Yukon transfer missed him from Deep hes out there with Johnny semy and Luther Smith as well and we hit the final half minute on this Friday night in Durham T of two halves no Applause question roach got it to go plus a Applause foul Roose just rejects the ball screen somehow Scoops that in hes wondering why he got fouled with 144 to go I think he was wondering if they gave him the a one or not like was this early did he is it two shots one underneath 18 for Jeremy roach Southern Indiana gave Duke everything it had tonight at camer but Dukes got an 862 win and the Blue Devils are 5 one headed to pville got to be pleased if RAR with the the way your team responded coming out of the second half they know they got work to do
