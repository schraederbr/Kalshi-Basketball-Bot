here to Stanford in just the second meeting all time between these two programs met back in 1979 it was a victory for Boston College in a neutral site contest from Providence Rhode Island a little different in this day and age of the ACC and the Eagles who have won two straight coachs they need to continue to stack wins to qualify for the ACC tournament the conference is only taking 15 of the top 18 teams well and that puts a premium on these games so youre right talk to the coaching staff today and they know how important their players do about getting a win today to put them in position to make the playoffs Stanford has been terrific in this building as Maxim Mareno draws an early foul its on Chad Benning graduate transfer from St Bonaventure and ball out of bounds not in the act of shooting well hes Max seem fleeing his case there look I wasnt I dont pass the ball when I get that close but uh hes not going to get that call but I thought he was kind of gathering and going up but nonetheless its out of Applause bounds Boston College they were excellent on this end last week as raino misses the step back jump shot Donovan young grabs a second effort BC allowed to combine 90 points in two wins last week that included holding Virginia Tech to 36 but they didnt face a big with the bag that Maxim REO has now just look at his ability to use either hand hes arguably better with his left hand Chris then he is with his right as he just demonstrated with a nice jump hook over his right shoulder a lot of continuity with this starting five Boston College pretty healthy entering this second to last week of the regular season post touch for venning and its taken away by Ryan agarwall an early steal for Stanford as Jaylen Blakes thats all Jaylen put his hands out over the basketball oiah sers has it slapped away underneath the freee throw line now keep your eyes on Boston College theyre pretty Scrappy defensively as well Blakes it bounces off and its taken by Roger McFarland Stanford Victorious here over the weekend against Cal beat their Rivals by five points to secure the season sweep against the Golden Bears and another early takeaway for the Cardinal good defense didnt allow the postup to take place Reno feeds it and sellers couldnt finish well he tried to dunk it Chris had the layup said nope Im Duncan and paid the price had a shot block thats hand for three and he puts it in and hes letting the the Cardinal bench know hes in the house tonight uh a little bit of barking going on early 23 points per game over his last seven leading Boston College at more than 16 and a half points per game this year Eagles shoot the three ball well but they dont take many out there Maxim REO first four for Stanford and again Chris goes to his left hand over his right shoulder if you dont know that in your scouting the court uh youre not paying attention thats what he does hes very good with that left hand Reno has posted at least 20 points 15 times this year Deon Brown out of the shot fake free throw line missed it wide to the right and raino vacuums it in theyre making a concerted effort to go inside to Maxim raino early and see if they can play through the big fell AER wall pulls from Deep comes up short Blakes had his hands on it here comes Dion Brown in BC count it and one for Dion Brown who took it Coast to Coast for the bucket that was a great fast break Chris that was a twoonone both players got lane lane line or wider and you can see it I mean thats textbook you get the ball in transition and now you see his teammate gets wide now one player has got to make a decision to guard two when he goes up and challenges but too late he gets the best and a chance for threepoint play Deon Brown who grew up in Massachusetts called Boston College his dream school as a 19 Point per game scorer at UNBC last season hes only scored in double figures five times this year coach but talked to Earl Grant he feels like hes getting closer and closer to the first team All Conference guard he was a season ago no he was a phenomenal player and hell get there hes hes a competitor raino picked up by venning and whistle for traveling yeah well you can see the difference Maxim Rs you know kind of on that short Corner not a lot of room you got the Baseline you got a couple Defenders to the middle uh just didnt gather himself and traveled but theyre going to hes had a post touch every possession so far theres Donald Dan Jr and he touched it last oiah sers had him blanketed defensively and forces Boston College into a third giveaway here early but how about these two teams defensively Chris theyre getting their hands on the ball every possession nothings easy you better be solid with the basketball because theres a man and a half to the ball uh really on every possession Benny geler first sub Off the Bench for Stanford REO for three and he knocks it down Benny heer knows his teammates you know you pick and pop and you help out on on the guard hell knock it back to Maxim and hell just drain shots from the three all seven Stanford points belong to the senior from France Benning kicks it out but threw it into the back court and Boston College a fourth turnover well good defensive intensity from Stanford you know theyve have capabilities to be a good team defensively and they know its important to their start because theyre facing a team in Boston College that really gets after you defensively but I like the I like the defensive pressure uh in both both teams so far this this game Earl Grant really felt like everything came together for this team in a couple of double figure wins at home Li week hoping they can travel out here to the West Coast its Stanford tonight Cal on Saturday for these Eagles as sellers Miss fires from the Applause corner this is Stanfords penultimate regular season home game SMU will visit Saturday venning misses gets it back and loses the Applause Music handle a pesky start defensively for the Cardinal on their home floor oiah sers transfer from USC hangs and misses but will have the first free throws of the Applause night yeah you like three point seven Footers most improved player last season in the conversation for ACC Player of the Year and always fun to do it in front of the loved ones who traveled a long way here to The Forum for a couple of games this week big fans and and uh truth be told moms kind of the tough one I talked to I said whos you get the toughness he said oh Moms on me shes pretty tough dads you know kind of reasoned with me and Moms the one that kind of you know runs a tough uh household there and and gets after him but uh I can I can relate it same thing happened growing up oiah sers the first Cardinal not named Maxim REO to hit the point column tonight chokar transfer from Harvard is checked in Off the Bench for Stanford Deon Brown almost wrapped it in Hastings Taps it Skyward but akara recovers the loose ball a nice drive by brown with just a little better defense good good recovery CL Brown had an angle to the basket Jaden Hastings the red shirt Frost from Orlando Florida Off the Bench for Boston College replacing Chad Benning the starting big Applause fella and he has the daunting task of trying to handle Maxim Reno on this end Reno out of the shot fake pitches to the corner sillers splashes the three how about your sevenfooter leading leading the charge with the wraparound behind the back pass for the three does it all doesnt he if hes not scoring hes facilitating and grabbing rebounds and he has very much played himself into a first round pick conversation this summer thats how good of a year hes had has popped on a ton of NBA draft Radars Donald Han Jr finds McFarland in Rhythm and he missed everything rer McFarland has really struggled now 15 of 60 below 25 from distance this year well give Stanford Credit I mean you here here you can see right now with the behind the back on the money I mean just knows where hes going he gets the defender to suck in and and then hes hes as excited about the assist as he is scoring its why you love Maxim raino but you know if youre Bost in college now you got to try to knock him off his game just try to get it out of his hands and change the defense up a little bit thats what coach Grant said he wants to do uh theyve been a great defensive team this year so hell have some tricks up his sleeve for Maxi Reno offensive foul is Stanford gives it back and its on raino for a moving Music screen yeah got to have your feet set and referees all over it now get a chance to give Maxim Reno a welld deserved blow in here Kyle Smith has already clinched a winning season here in his first campaign on the farm Stanfords first winning season since the 2021 abbreviated campaign theyve been excellent here at home 142 in Maples thats deflected out yeah they they put a really nice win Street together but you mentioned cal Smith who has been a great coach his all his stops along the way coach at Columbia in the ivy league did a stellar job there USF San Francisco as well uh started his career was at St Marys at Randy benns Air Force hes been everywhere and hes hes had a a lot of success Jos Beetle going Baseline no Brown off the glass it bounces through thats a great look from Brown I think Deon Browns got great balance hes a threat youve got to get out in threepoint line because he can knock it down but hes so quick with his first step to go around you and then avoid fouling or charging one of two Massachusetts born players on the roster and a reach in foul on Elijah strong on this end well you see Boston College Chris theyre going to play aggressively theyre not going to give you post position youre going to have to make a quick move in there if you get the ball and put it down too many times theyll dig the ball out so you got to make a quick move and you got to really be strong with the ball year four for Earl Grant at Boston College 20 wins and second round trip to the NIT last season the pocket pass to agar wall one more to camon for two now good look for Stanford but you mentioned Earl Grant uh really a solid year last year nit 20 wins I mean getting it done in very tough ACC last touched by oaro who is insisting that Elijah strong had touched it last remember Pat Kelce took over for Earl Grant after he left the College of Charleston for Bost in college and what a year Pat Kels put together in his first season at Louisville now it was phenomenal I mean hes one of the better coaching jobs in the Applause country Eagles have only attempted four shots from the floor almost 8 minutes in fatal extra pass brown lost the handle its another turnover the sixth already yeah they little bit too unselfish they had chances to shoot it tried to make an extra pass and gave it up its a weaken California for Boston College got here late Monday night and theyll stick around until Sunday after their Saturday night game in Berkeley bakara spinning and the hook shot bounces in now Chism mokaro can get to the rim Chris hes been playing better basketball lately I think hes really had a little bit of a low when the year started but now hes getting out and finding ways to attack the basket Applause Fred Payne true freshman with a scoring prowess has checked in for Boston College Elijah strong fade fires and missed it strong camon grabs it for Stanford and it went off the lower half of sellers now that was not a picture talked about his former Mentor uh Gary Waters was one of my former coaches and done a lot for him but you know they they built their success over defense and you know if you want to start with building a program you got to have a foundation and defense defense wins Chris and I really believe that ear you know ears got the ability to set up a really sound defensive system you can just say with the stats you just you just mentioned thats getting it done team thats lost some tough overtime games this year triple overtime against Syracuse double overtime against Notre Dame they took Carolina to overtime and lost to the dean Dome earlier this year well think about they lost five phenomenal players from the NIT team so theyre rebuilding doing it all over and theyre still competitive thats a credit to Earl in the staff pay spots up and it pops out Fred kans first attempt shoots almost 40 from Applause Deep someone Earl Grant calls the Junkyard Dog of this BC team foul away from the basketball and the Eagles you know Erol Grants a refreshing coach because hes a guy thats not afraid to learn not afraid to spend time hes hes taken some philosophies hes tweaked them hes made them better made him his own but he said today in practice he look Ive been around too many guys not to be a decent coach and not to pick up some things and a lot of respect for what hes done Ager wall missfires from the Baseline aara on the offensive glass Jaylen Blakes buries the three thats a tough shot I mean he was challenged I thought pretty hard on that three and he knocked it down his threepoint shooting has improved this year started out struggling from three now hes knocking down shots regularly it is been a breakout campaign for The Graduate transfer from duke who never averaged more than two points per game in his time with the Blue Devils first points off the bench for the graduate from Clemson Joshua Beetle thats a big time move again with the off hand appeared in 32 games on Clemsons Elite 8 Squad last year aara cant hit heads up play by C but gilers pass elusive as he tried to get it to Blakes raino sers and Donovan young check back in for Stanford yeah those plays will drive you crazy as a coach Chris you look at Kyle Smith he just put his hands up in the air shook his head like how do you throw the ball away when your teammates open 8 feet away from you and just threw it over his head and uncharacteristic Benny giler doesnt throw many away his assist a turnover for about four to one so you know a tough tough play for him Benning off the bounce scared Donald H back to the big fell venning leans in on raino and missed it short that was good defense by Maxim R staying grounded not leaving his feet raino that was partially blocked Benning got a piece of it hes top 100 in the country in Block percentage hand steps into a three missed it off the heel it Ricochet to pay and the short jump shot off the glass and in well thats going to again Drive Kyle Smith and his staff crazy you give up you dont mind the block shot but then you dont get back in transition and then you give up an offensive rebound uh thats a tough sequence if youre Stanford Fred Payne was an ESPN fourstar Prospect out of high school Maxim Reno rips the courts on his second first half triple well he says Ill make up for that block shot just let me get one reload and he knocked it Down clean raino has hit both attempts from out there the first into double fingers on either side now 50 made triples here in his final College season Beetle goes Baseline through it to Donovan young yeah good Anticipation by Stanford they got right to the coffin corner where you got to get to when theres penetration raino hit on the way up and thats the second foul on Chad Benning well he did a good job Chris exposing the ball a little bit and using his body to draw that foul and thats you know you can see hes hes got position but he you know goes into the paint drop steps and he gets a lead put in and just kind of exposes his shoulder and his in his arms and hes able to draw the foul very clever play by Maxim Reno Reno 78 on the season from the free throw line but near 90 in ACC games hey the number two Duke Blue Devils highlight our Saturday basketball triple header NC State and Georgia Tech tip off the afternoon at 3 Eastern then SMU squares off against Stanford here on the farm and we cap the night with Duke hosting Florida State itll be senior day for Stanford here Saturday afternoon well its going to be special you just saw the Ros again uh making that trip all the way from Ferris France but theyre here and theyre going to honor their son uh and all the seniors uh always a special day Chris when I coached those were very emotional days when you know youre going to lose your seniors and their families are there to kind of send them Applause off Stanford has built this lead to 11 as jayen Blakes caught with his hand in the cookie jar reaching in on Chaz Kelly well interesting loow you know you say well Stanfords got a nice lead but you know theyve given up leads in the last couple games they had a big lead against Cal and only have the game tied with a few to go had a 16point lead theyve been in this gym had double digit lead so if youre Kyle Smith you know youre concerned you want to keep the defensive pressure up and not play giveaway Music basketball Kelly uses the Hastings screen a clean look for strong Hastings on the offensive glass Chaz Kelly for three well again you play good defense or you think its good defense but when you dont give up when you give up a second shot you didnt play good defense you got to close the door and that second chance really hurt Stanford Music Applause I I like that Maxim Renos posting up with both feet in the paint and hes doing it in a high low situation its so much harder to guard him when youre feeding him from the high post theres no help side these are Second Chance points for BC yeah lets watch lets watch raino he screens down pins down he posts with both hands and if you front him hes going to take the lob if you play behind its going directly in so I love Maxim Reno in the in the in the middle of the Music paint now Hastings with Benning on the bench with those two fouls and its an offensive foul against Stanford well I dont think thatll please the Stanford staff and now Maxim Renos got a couple so he might have to come out and he is theyre going to take little chance for him to pick up a quick third because hes been playing so well theyre going to have to give him a break hell go to the bench yeah take a look at it watch his lead shoulder he he he pushes off not only with his shoulders forearm and Greg Nixon the veteran official right on it eight minutes to play in the opening half as Kelly sneaks inside and last touched by BC Stanford will have it when we return Cardinal have an eightpoint opening half lead on their home floor but Maxim Reno and some first half foul trouble well how about the mom Vanessa we talked about how tough she is and you can see when Maxim REO lines up to shoot the free throw and shes you know she smiles but now when he misses like what come on man you shes on her son but then when he you know little tough love right but then when he makes the free throw what does she do she says okay now its a little bit different reaction now shes going to blow him a kiss Chris I can relate my mom did this she was tough on me my team was really struggling from the free throw line I worked on it we get to be third in the country so Mom were third in the country she goes big deal exem me big deal she you guys never get to the line so thats what you call unconditional love yeah so Ive had it both ways and I can jooy I can relate to the Ros but uh you know I I love it I a mans best friend is his mother dont forget well you wont see much of Maxim Reno the remainder of this first half one would think in foul trouble with a couple as Deon Brown picks it off the hardwood to take away for BC you got to watch this this this segment of the game with Maxim raino on the bench theyre they they can lose some of their continuity both offensively and defensively Fred Payne with four points Off the Bench he stops and starts a quick trigger from hand Hastings had it for a moment camon did poke it out well you can see that Boston College Is Not Afraid now theyre trying to post up inside they want to take advantage of raino being on the bench with two so theyre not just going to settle theyre going to try to get some inside looks and postups Aiden camon in that five spot for Stanford saw 17 minutes over the weekend here against the cow Bears hes capable defensively hes a hes a hustler hes pretty long can challenge shots Kelly picked up by camon takes him into the paint and camman creates the takeaway for Stanford Blakes gives it right back yeah again uncharacteristic of Jaylen Blakes to get those successive turnovers Standford playing a little bit of giveaway right now Earl Grant BCs fourth year head coach has a saying gritty not pretty that kind of summarizes the first half its been between the Eagles and Cardinal and the possession arrow keeps it with Boston College with 11 on the timer well now you got a short clock good hustle both teams scrapping on the floor if youre Stanford you you know youve been getting your hands on a lot of balls and youre going to have to continue to play aggressively Chris because theyre playing with their man their big fell out so theyre at a deficit now down to five to shoot Kelly whips it and pain Miss fires stening off the bench has his first rebound yeah good possession by stord they closed the door on a short clock and thenen rebounded arara backs in Donald Han Jr and the patience for two now he did that when he was playing at at Harvard I mean he made a living in there for Tommy Amer and when he does that Chris hes a load I mean thats what they need with Reno out of the game you got need another post uh threat and he is he can get there a 16 and a half Point per game score at Harvard last season Brown cradles it through the contact no basket offensive foul as he runs over jayen Blakes Chris Jaylen Blakes has done that all year hes given up his body and and and drawn the charge watch again on the offensive end the drive to the basket and Jaylen Blakes and then you can watch chisim Oar who gets in the rim as you mentioned great footwork freezes his Defender just goes up strong hes so strong with the ball but up by great pivoting in the inside the paint mosiah sers wal off mid post and floats it in now hes been quiet but when he can Chris he can put numbers on the board hes a capable score hes had big games this year Stanford trying to dig in defensively Cardinal have balloon this lead to a dozen Beetle fires sellers clears back to the Boston College two for eight from the outside in this first half aara steps back yes sir hes feeling it now too and boy as he improved his threepoint percentage really struggled when the year started now he is knocking down shots Cardinals on fire seven straight for Stanford and seven Off the Bench for oara that was deflected into the back court paint recovers and Hastings the moving screen well I really like since what he did he sold that he he he he took contact and sold that last play but the last three here you can see Chism mokar what a great left hand I mean hook pass to chis mokaro who just spots it and Nails it great look by jayen bles to his teammate Benny Giller back in the lineup now Chris 45 from the outside doesnt take a ton of them no but he struggled started but he sure locked down and and put his percentages way up right now Stanford doubling up Boston College and oar whistled for an offensive foul away from the ball yeah and you dont have to do that I mean hes a big enough guy you dont have to push off and clear off to get position I mean you either are going to post up and get fronted or you going your Defender going to play behind so you dont have to push way out on the floor and now you you look at stand for in their bench theyve got to make some decisions they dont want to see another player going to the bench in file trouble officials appear to be well theyre going to look stopping play to take a second look at this yeah I think I think the question is did they was there any contact previous pile is under reved now potential contact to the face marus pedig just came over and told us Chris I I obviously if there is contact incidental or not to the face theyll call that as an excessive and flagrant foul so that would be a tough break to him you thought maybe when Maxim Reno went to the bench with the two fouls that Boston College would find some more scoring opportunities Eagles havent scored in almost four minutes and theres theres the potential contact to the face it was it was early and there was contact to the face so again you know the officials arent supposed to decide if if you meant to do it or not either you you made contact to the face or you dont a lot of people dont understand the rule or the intented rle you dont have to make be doesnt have to be in 10 its if you put contact in in the head or face area youre supposed to call it so lets see what happens see how the officials look at it here watch watch the hand Chris you can see there it is right here the arm elbow to the neck and head and so fishes are going to have to determine is this sucessive stand has built a nice lead you dont want the momentum to change and those kinds of plays you know they change the momentum before halftime so huge call common foul yeah its common foul all right well chis mokara just breathed a fresh breath of relief there and uh but I think its a learning experience too that you dont need to clear off when you post you post with your lower body Chris not your upper body I think if you told Earl Grant before the game that thered be a combined 45 point scored this first half hed feel like his team would be in better position than they are right now yeah good point and and and thats what theyve done though they just havent given up a lot of points theyre stingy they combined 18 turnovers between these teams bennings back in the game with two fouls strong strong grabs the Miss and blocked by Stinson underneath yeah good block thats a really good look for a second effort looked like it was going to be a layup obviously and I love this S one out got a piece of the ball the been a tough start for venning whos scoreless with four giveaways an accomplished big man who checked into the night threepoint shy of 1400 for his career hand Fades fires been a tough first half for him too yeah well thats good defense by Benny giler and his defense has improved hes really stepped up and I thought stayed grounded and did a good job of challenging on that last possession and has been held to just three points on one field goal this first half arara drives it theres sellers to the Baseline and no attempt and a foul on the four before the Applause shot looks like theres a clock issue Gris that the clock might have stopped an appropriate Wrinkle In whats been a pretty clunky first half here on the Forum well theres been a lot of missed opportunities with both teams but you know again the defensive pressure Ive been impressed with these teams are guarding and theyre and are being very active defensively and yeah the clock clock definitely stops and officials doing a good job of of of uh nipping it in the bud so well see this where you have to whip out your stopwatch and kind of see where things are those are the old yo games C bbo whatever it was you you know it was the the clock you just had a manual clock there but you know theres enough things with lineup Duke the number one overall seed trailed by Louisville Clemson and Wake Forest getting the double buys Stanford in pretty good position here in their first season in the conference with the seventh seed at the moment no that looks good but those top seeds are theyre going to be tough for anybody late in the clock all of the sudden nakara steps back and cant hit this one Donald H Jr runs the show for Boston College in need of some sort of offensive continuity here before the break yeah hes been quiet and hes capable he can put up big numbers Elijah strong picked up by Stinson muscles it up there and earns a couple of free throws for BC well that was good defense until he reached in Chris and all he had to do is go straight up uh you know its just its all it is on defense is discipline youve got to stay grounded you got to challenge up not out your arms are out youre going to draw foul and and believe me coach has work on this religiously every day I mean players just sometimes get a little Amnesia get a little uh caught with their hands in the cookie jar as they say but I think yeah hey our final Thursday night womens basketball double header of the regular season its Clemson and 25th ranked Louisville tipping off tonight at 6 Eastern then third ranked Notre Dame hosts number 24 Florida State and Tania lson in South Bend well Kyle Smith and the staff have decided to trust Maxim REO and putting him back in the game with you know under the TB timeout three to go and just say hey you got to play without picking up a third we dont want you playing with a deficit in the second half so keep your eyes on Max te R see if Boston College goes at him a little bit Chad Benning starting big man for Boston College back on the floor with two fouls as well tried to skip that one to Reno tapped back to sers shot clock in a single figures Benny geler pulls it from deep and up over the back board out of Bounce yeah never gotten their Rhythm on that possession at all credit to Boston College theyre still defending Chris theyre struggling offensively but theyre staying in this game defensively making it know a little tough for Stanford Stanford shooting 55 this first half but uncharacteristically theyve turned it over eight times and thats what Pon College wants you to do Cardinal have dropped into his Zone defensively very good Chris I love it pain elbow book it well you recogniz his own but I dont think Stanford did so theyve got to step up a little bit and and and and you know and they just their Boston College would recognize it I should say thats interesting Stanford having camon and raino share the floor at the same time here down the stretch of the first half agar wall drives Reno on the offensive glass has the stick back yeah very patient by Maxim Reno he waited for the Defenders to clear go up in the air and scored it nice job now theyre back in the zone again its a two3 match up this theyll theyll put one on the ball try not to waste two on the ball guard the man in their area you can see them dropping to the level of the ball one on the ball seven Second Chance points for Stanford through the first 18 minutes and change hand gets to his midrange spot off Target nice challenge One Max te really he came all the way out from the paint to challenge Donald H thats thats good defense hand the reigning ACC player of the week first Eagle to win it three times in a season since Jared Dougley as raino splashes in his his third tray and he makes it look easy thats the thats what Maxim Raina will do Chris youll if you give him some room on the perimeter he will not hesitate its going up another slingshot make theres Blakes on the attack and he drops the hammer timeout BC as Stanford well the life of a coach Chris what do you do when your players got two do you put them back in well Smith said yeah were going to put him back in and soon as Maxim REO goes back in he immediately promptly puts the ball in the basket for short range and he says you know what youre not going to guard me from three Im going to knock that down and then jayen Blakes does what he does Highway robber he getes out in the break uh Max Mareno great job while he was in to turn his team and now he goes sits the final minute and a half so he will out pick up a third foul seven straight for the Cardinal to build this lead to 18 as pain cant hit from the outside and camon claims it thats a good job again Stanford staying with that zone smart play just see if they can not get beat inside with Maxim Reno out on the bench a two for one opportunity for the Cardinal if they hurry camon faces up on Benning that two for one opportunity has now gone by the wayside shot clock into single digits agall trying to create backing in pain spins left almost kissed at home off the window and Boston College can now hold for the final take of the opening 20 no and they will they hell afford to give the ball back to Stanford Stanford in the zone looking for a man in their area hand deep three in and out and a microcosm of the opening 20 as BC finishes this first half just 7 to 27 from the field and down 18 out west at Stanford the Stanford North to 50 Boston College out to 30 how do the Eagles find some continuity on offense these final 20 minutes theyve got to try to get to the basket and if they can maybe can get to the foul line but Jaylen Blake is saying not so fast we you got to guard us first so it starts with defense and thats what Earl grants teams got to do theyve got to find ways to slow down uh Stanford stopped them a little bit Stanford grows its lead to 20 with the Blakes bucket out of the break vening the spin couldnt wrap it in brown tried to tap it back its taken by Reno well again thats you know just rushing themselves a little bit Stanfords defense has been good you can say well Roston college has not shot it well but Stanfords defense has had a lot to do with it Chris theyve been really aggressive defensively osiah sers pulls up raino Taps it and L touched by Kelly well hes lucky hes 7 one because he went over the top for sure but he was able to keep that ball alive and obviously goes off an eagle Stanford now trying to employ Jaylen Blakes off the dribble great looking side my goodness Ryan agal how about that oh for four in the first half but Jaylen Blakes set him up for his first points tonight now Stamper now going to go back to a little bit of a drop zone see if they can avoid getting next Reno in foul trouble but I like the call and you know why not opponent shooting 25 good time to Zone McFarland leans in and the runner Falls I like that ability from Boston College not to settle from the perimeter but try to split the seam and score inside they did Roger McFarland in his first season at BC transfer from Southeastern Louisiana as sers is fouled on the way up a crafty move to get downhill and osiah sers one of three undergrad transfers that Kyle Smith brought in over his first off season here on the farm will take free throws for the Cardinal hes a guy that gives him you know that third score second or third score hes had big games for Stanford this year when theyve had a couple of guys like Reno in foul trouble Jaylen Blakes has been out or you know injured its been oiah sers thats come up and hes had some big game so hes capable hes very unselfish player I know Kyle Smith and his staff would like to see him get a little bit more Z grew up in this region in Hayward spent the last two years at USC and really looking forward to going toe to Toe with his former head coach Andy Enfield Saturday when SMU Vision thats going to be an interesting match up always is when you face your former team and your former coach theres the Zone trying to match up out of the Zone McFarland clean look and a knock down from Dave well they didnt get they had two on the ball there Chris and in the matchup Zone you cant waste on the ball because nobody was thats to long too long of a run for the outside Wing to come out and guard well five BC points to start the second half courtesy of Roger McFarland and now a takeaway for Donald Han Jr hand attacks agar wall stumbling down the lane and finally a whistle for a tie up keeping the possession with Boston College what have you seen Stanford do defensively to frustrate Donald Dan Jr whos just one for six from the field well theyre on them you know every time he puts it down you got another Defender you can see there theyre going to send a second Defender there thats how much they respect Donal and he hell beat you oneonone so you got to get a Defender there and get him early on defense Chris you can be early offense you can be a step slow and late on defense you you can never be late you better be early and tampers done a good job of getting there for early he venning down the Baseline Brown tried to throw it down and missed the flush yeah he had a wide open look nobody there just missed it Applause the struggle has been real on that end for BC agar wall scores inside off another dime from Jaylen Blakes who takes it away almost flipped it in and a late whistle for a foul well how about the turn of events there you got agarwall with the drive jayen Blakes playing udini out here on the other end just stepping in and getting a steal out of nowhere I mean Stanfords been really aggressive really astute defensively theyve alert and this is one of their better defensive efforts Chris Ive seen them most of this year and this is a game where theyre just on top of things defensively theyre talking theyre communicating and theyre quick to the ball they are really giving Boston College some fits defensively Blakes has a younger sister Michaela whos a freshman at vanderbelt might be the best freshman in the country on the womens side now shes tough I mean if you havent seen her you you should you can see even out of the Zone theyre extending out here theyre just going to get out of the Music floor as Kelly terminates his dribble heres Dion Brown along the end line and a foul called before the attempt well and thats what you have to do Chris against an aggressive defense youre playing against a team thats aggressive if you dont attack them off the dribble youre playing right in their hands and I I think Boston College youre going to see them put the ball down and trying to get to the rim a little more only problem is you got Maxine Reno there thats going top just or or alter your shots Benning has a mismatch as he backs in Donovan young and scores with a right hand hook well that was smart he went away from raino raino was working in the middle but he went back to the Baseline first points of the night for Chad venning as Kelly Dives on the sideline and could not stay in Balance car ear Grant was trying to get a timeout if he could to save The Possession heads up play by the coach but they just couldnt get possession back and uh feet were out of bounds I think uh officials might to make sure but you can see the aggression now from Boston College theyre picking up the pace a little bit theyre going to try to take Stanford out of it and see if they can get a couple more Applause turnovers theres Donovan young freshman from Pasco Washington Reno backs in Benning perfect he is automatic with that right hand push shot well I call that his his weaker hand even though its his natural hand but hes showing the ability either hand scoring it over his shoulder Chaz Kelly feeds venning who goes up and under plus the foul two plus one for Chad venning and thats what they want to get out of Chad P if he he can get to the basket thats helps but its Maxim Reno about the job hes doing for the Cardinal hes tough hes tenacious no all jayen Blakes hes Prince all over this start the second half watch the job he does by just dropping off passes hes got the ability he plays with his head up uh love his ability to get by his Defender and he just knows his teammates Chris hes just dropped two dimes to his his teammate and how about the the steal and the foul that he drew I mean thats a thats a sixpoint turnaround by Jaylen Blakes and look at what hes done from last year to this year average three points a year a Duke now averaging 14 better than 2 to1 assist aternal he is definitely one of the more improved players in the country someone Kyle Smith has called a pleasant surprise he he didnt think hed be averaging almost 14 points per game but hes hes controlled the tempo almost every game that theyve played and theyve won hes been that important its raino feeding sellers for two how about your point forward up top here Point Center again with the dime from the top he can pass CH not only can he score it block shots and rebound you know he can do those things but hes an excellent passer sers has 11 and the double figures for a 23rd time this year shot clock into single digits for BC Donald Han Jr off the hill claimed by REO in sight yeah theyve done a great job on hands he just hasnt had many good looks Chris thats a credit to now yep aara could not catch the entry pass cleanly it Ricochet is out to Applause sers Baseline two sellers missed it Blake Soares in for the second effort and sellers sticks the three yeah thats got to be an assist Chris but how about the second effort by Stanford I Ill tell you thats a sequence that just as epitomize how Stanford has played multiple efforts look look at whats happening on this possession theres a shot by cers is the Miss thats Jaylen Blakes keeping it alive I mean giving up his body and getting cell is a second look in a Reload I mean Jaylen Blakes is doing it all hes a physical player hes tough hes resilient hell play through injuries hes getting a much deserved rest on the bench and hes you know playing with a little bit of an injury Stanfords Plus 26 in Jaylen Blakes 21 minutes tonight yeah I think youre pretty wise to put him on the floor Chris I think youre going to youre going to get some dividends but hes been that kind of player for Stanford all year long hes dominated Tempo and their big wins this year if you look at his minutes those plus minutes youre just talking about hes been on the plus side every game Stanford has two quad one wins Jaylen Blakes has delivered gamewinning jump shots in the final seconds of both of them yeah big time at Santa Clara and at North Carolina earlier in conference play yeah people forget about that one thats huge a post touch for venning and he scores over the top of Maxim Reno oh thats a tough shot Reno just stood his ground but uh good job offensively by getting the ball up and over all six of Chad bennings points after halftime a slingshot three and Reno rattles it in I love giler and Reno theyve got that twoman game going they right away Benny giler knew that there was a help off the screen he delivered that pass right back into Maxim Reno for the for the three 16th time Maxim Reno has passed 20 points in a game this year to reach in foul on Benny geler up top well you see you see Maxim Marino talking to his point guard I think hes theyre just trying to talk a little bit out there and see if they can take advantage of the coverage but heres the three heres the pass back and the knock down three Reno on fire four trays for maxim Mareno tonight McFarland On Target this second treay now he can do that Chris you know they need more of that because he shoots a pretty good clip from there hes hes a capable player grad grad student uh from Southeast Louisiana he can get it done 15 Point per game score in the Southland a heat check for R later you cant get too mad at him hes feeling Music it only Renos third Miss from the field tonight hes 8 for 11 McFarland turns the corner sets up pay and brown fouls oara jism oara gives you that second rebounder the second player on the floor thats got some size and girth some strength inside he started out the season but now hes playing a lot better basketball hey the nations top mens lacrosse team square off Saturday afternoon right here on acc Network number one Notre Dame takes on number two Maryland coverage begins at one Eastern here on the ACC Network also streaming live on the ESPN app doesnt get much bigger than one verse two no thats uh thats going to be a matchup to say the least dalen Blakes cammon blocked on the second attempt and last touched by Stanford Stanford awfully aggressive on the class their Boston College very fortunate they came away with no collateral damage on that play but Renos getting a break uh Chris and he deserves it hes put hes put some numbers up hes been everywhere on this floor assisting leading rebounding shot blocking knocking down threes hes been tough Luca Taves a true freshman from Tokyo Japan getting his first run tonight for Boston College venning out muscles camon for the bucket inside you see what Boston College does as soon as raino goes out of the game theres no theres no thought process about what they want to do immediately go in the paint and get a basket Benning has found some comfortable spots in the low post this second half up to eight points out of the break oara leaning in staying pace and scoring over the top of McFarland now he show the ability to avoid traveling and just keep his dribble keep his pivot down and just get a good look for the basket hes so strong he doesnt hurry himself he can get to the foul Benning turns the corner tried to throw it down and got hit on the way up yeah again great strategy by Boston College they see a mismatch and theyre taking advantage of it vendings just so good inside been a veteran presence among a relatively young BC Squad Chad Benning now North of 1400 career points two years at Morgan State out of high school the last two at St Bonnie yeah he had great no great look to St Bonnie for coach smid and you know hes a veteran you cant say enough today about veterans theres so many players get a chance to play that grad year and theyre taking advantage of it but thats a when you get a veteran player that does that that gives your team a lift it really does you see that Boston cge would like to pick up the pace here see if they can hurry and force a couple of turnovers aara gets it another patient attempt this time Benning comes over to deny the shot I thought great footwork Again by aara but just better defense nice job defensively 173rd career block for Chad venning who missed the right hand Hammer but draws another foul hes got a confidence going on hes attacked the basket at will the last three possessions but tonight has again belong to Stanfords Maxim Reno whos got a game high 21 points yeah and what does he do for an uncore hard to say but he just puts the ball in the basket finds ways you give him an inch he will knock it down and why not because Mom is in the stands and she loves the action go ahead Vanessa celebrate that your Applause son all Stanford on their home floor tonight out west in the ACC 5936 the Cardinal over Boston College glad youre with us Chris sester with Coach Ben Brun our producer Gregory Pike director Jimmy Lee Starling a Stanford 142 here at home and theyve been dominant again inside the friendly confines tonight and this is really in my opinion Chris one of the better start now to this point games theyve had theyve had very little few LS and theyve been doing it on both ends of the floor not just off ly which is obvious but theyve been playing really good defense against Boston College they play like this theyre tough team to beat Maxim Mareno back on the floor for Stanford out of the timeout Blakes couldnt finish that and lost his shoes so Boston College has a five on four Luca Taves hits the three now they knew what to do five on four they didnt rush themselves they waited and they found their open man great great job uh by Boston College BC just his second made field goal in ACC play freshman from Tokyo Japan who finished high school in Boston Blakes couldnt wrap it in he had a chance to go strong side uh board decided to go across Applause underneath and now Blake whistled for the foul yeah you Stanfords a little bit late now you can see theyre a step behind and and Boston CLE is starting to get their Rhythm a little bit more theyre getting to the line theyre beating their Defenders on Cuts question is do they have enough time to get back in uh theyre going to have to pick it up defensively not just put points in the board but theyve got to find ways to stop stord little six nothing burst put together by Applause Music BC Elijah strong five to shoot into the double team and poked away Here Comes oara Down the Hatch and he lays it in a great play by chisim aaro he waited for the defender to clear Chris used his body his strength to put two on the board thats a big basket 11 Off the Bench for the Harvard transfer and Stanford balloons the lead back to 20 Benning comes up short not the same youre going up over raino thats not quite the same Defender thats a little tougher chore vennings had a big half all 11 of his points after the break but much of that with Maxim Reno on the bench sers aara the second effort sers tries it two and connects yeah hes been great at second effort fast since he missed the first a couple of times only to get a chance to reload and hes knocked down I think three of those in a row 16 for sellers Taves free throw line book it yeah hes getting a chance to earn a little time here aggressive the way hes knocking down those shots now youre Stanford you dont want to go into a deep freeze but you dont want to be in a hurry either and let Boston College go on any kind of major run here tapes has been a nice spark sellers comes up short on an open look from the corner pocket BC up to 40 from the field but Trail by 20 R now one rebound away right Chris from a double double I think that would be his 21st of the Season about that and hes probably going to get it he stays on the floor its hard to imagine him going the rest of the game without a rebound agall from the outside bangs home the three he does that Ryan Agarwal felt it did not hesitate love players that dont hesitate Chris he was conf he put it up and he was rewarded he knocked it down this 33rd tray of the Season stanfords ninth tonight venning back to work falling away and he kisses it in off the window now good aggression you know he took the ball to the basket and I thought that was a really good aggressive play hes been really tough this half 13 now for Chad Benning to lead Boston College Tonight Reno midrange Music Applause Donald Han Jr his first points since the opening minute and a timeout Kyle Smith as Boston College has trimmed the deficit to 18 Stanford getting a chance now to build a lead and why chisim oara hes been tough in side and hes tough on the boards hes tough with the steel in the lane why not finish with some strength with 741 to play yeah great timeout by Kyle Smith hes got to try to stem the tide here a little bit Boston College starting to get aggressive if youre Stanford you got to handle pressure now youre going to see some Applause Music pressure almost a 10sec call Earl Grant was bleeding for It Reno wrap around Applause Gaylor second effort Ryan agarwall has it slapped out of his hands now falls on his wallet and the possession arrow will have it with Stanford on the other side Cardinal by 18 71 second Music half and Johnny Dawkins whos now the head coach at UCF all those guys would have liked to have a big that plays like Maxim Reno whos now got 23 Now Incredible and I I Ive known most those coaches when theyre during their tenure year not not only great coaches but great leaders of young men I cant say enough about those guys a soft touch for Elijah strong his first field goal tonight inside of seven minutes here 18point lead for Stanford Boston College gets a takeaway and Taves as it deflected out by the always active Jaylen Blakes yeah you know Stanford cant act surprised now with those turnovers that that BCs going to be coming with the kitchen sink theyre going to come with everything they got theyre going to and theyre going to use some fouls too so you got to be strong with the basketball down the stretch this games not over by a long stretch you got to you got to put this team away if you want to win BC is going to scrap thats what they do three regular season games remain for both Stanford and BC following this one strong leans in and another one bounces home theyre finding ways to score so if they can keep Stanford from getting baskets uh they can put this turn this game around but they havent shown the ability to really get consecutive stops on Stanford so far as close as Boston College has been in this second half raino right over the top of strong it rolls off and here comes Boston College Payne Euro Step uses the off hand and tapped out to Elijah strong for a second effort there there hustling BC is really really aggressive to the ball Chris theyve done a good job this down the stretch here Taves bounces to Hastings they could never find the handle there and a foul against Jaylen Blakes I wouldnt be surprised you might see stord go back to that zone see if they can make Boston College knock some shots down from the perimeter because theyre giving up some inside scores no foul on Blakes there it was actually a kick ball Music called a shot clock reset to 20 regardless Hastings misses the dunk and McFarland misses the follow well thankfully Maxim Reno went up and got I believe another rebound which if he did hes now hit his double figure mark his National leading 21st double double of the year yeah thats thats saying something Chris that and that was a huge rebound that is a program record here at Stanford as the MVP chance break out theyve had some awfully good post players here Ive coach against them but Maxim raino is AB among the best I mean thats thats just set you apart Chris when you put up those numbers Blakes it bounces off to pay the outlet pass to Elijah strong and he couldnt wrap it in but gets fouled on the way up yeah and I think obviously Kyle Smiths not happy about that quick shot and then the foul Maxim Reno whos got 23 points 10 boards couple of assists tonight uh has become an NBA Prospect here in his final College season youve had the pleasure of coaching 24 guys that had gone on to play in the association how do you think his game will translate well interestingly Ive got some former players that are scouts the NBA and they like his ability you know and his durability you know you always question is a player a going to get better because you get drafted in the NBA on your potential but if you look at Maxim Reno hes gotten better of a year look at his stats every year hes played so if thats true and you can project that hes going to continue get it better better hes an excellent Prospect Chris he reminds me a lot if you ask me about a player of of of Ryan Anderson that played for me in Cal that was a 611 post guy but he really his strength was going out in knocking down threes rexing Reno can do those two things so theres a place for him in the NBA theres no doubt about that and hes a great passer he I mean hes got the whole package you what he doesnt do Im not sure I Ive watched him play a t but he can defend if youre a general manager I dont know how you cannot put him in your conversation hey Saturday night will Dew our documentary about the 9192 Duke mens basketball team the first backtoback national champ since the UCLA Dynasty years Coach K Christian lner Grant Hill Bobby Hurley and so many more Blue Devils were interviewed for this amazing dock the 1 hour special premieres at 9 Eastern right here on the ACC Network and the ESPN app I want to see that appointment television I definitely want to see that I knew those teams knew the coaching staff my goodness thats special strong cork screws and finishes with a southpaw delivery yeah I really like the ability of you know when you look back at this game if youre BC youre going to see youve got the ability to get aggressive in the basket theyve done that really well second half within 15 here with the clock is a factor approaching 4 minutes Reno on the elbow skips it to to akara through the double team and it was rather surprised how open that shot was underneath well he was waiting for Defenders to go up and try to block a shot nobody bit so he said okay youre not going to go up block my shot Im going to score it but hes done a great job with that all game long as hes been really patient inside Deon Brown feeds a freight train Hastings throws it down you chart this half second half Chris and youll see very few shots in the perimeter most of BC score have come Point Blank at The Rim only six trays and 18 attempts for Boston College tonight now they got theyre showing their version of the zone now theyre going back to man aara takes it to the cup for two more Chris he plays like that Stanfords a different basketball team hes given them a dimension that really they havent had in a while hes been terrific tonight his eighth game in figures this season McFarland tees it and splashes in his second trade Benny giler shaking his head like what more do I need to do I challenge up I challenge out and he still nailed it 114 McFarland and a timeout BC inside of 3 minutes well the Eagles have played much better this second half but Stanford still in control with 253 to play didnt know that he could do this in this league hes done it and then some Stanford has been a great surprise this year already 17 victories on the verge of number 18 here as Ros fouled by Hastings with 241 to play Cooper flag only half a point in the PPG colum behind Maxim REO Ian sheflin would have a ways to go rebounding the basketball hed need a couple what 25 rebound efforts to catch Maxim in that category thats going to be hard Chris much as I think hes a good player those are tough numbers but Maxim Reno hes put his hes put his uh Prince all over this game sers fouled by Hastings off a nice dish from oara well I really like Stanfords ability to attack the basket by the cut when you cut to the basket your Defender cant see ball and you I mean but watch the pass on the top I mean chisim aara and and and oiah sers I mean heres the pass I mean that ball didnt stick in chisim MO Faros hands very long at all I mean he caught it and got rid of it one motion I mean that almost looked like a fumble but it wasnt that was a pass Chris and jar he stepped his game up Ive been impressed with him hes earned himself some playing time I be hard pressed to figure hes not going to be uh garnering some more more minut minutes for the rest of this season R Frost Jaden Hastings picking up his fifth foul here so Chad venning checks back in you can see the confidence on Stanfords players I mean they were tested in the second half but they didnt will they could have and they didnt they just maintained the presence and this has been a really good effort by the Cardinal Mah sers now with 18 points and Taves throws it away sellers the steel couldnt scoop it in a he rushed Music himself Stanford few weeks ago they were in that bubble conversation had a tough stretch where the lost four of six sunk into the 80s of the net you got SMU here coming on Saturday and that large hopeful team much things are are in Berkeley tonight big opportunity for Stanford theyre theyre really if this is the time you want to play your best basketball and theyre playing some of it right now the reverse nowhere close as Maxim Maro gets knocked down and in some pain holding his face you got hit in the eye Chris that thats never fun I wouldnt be surprised to see Maxim raino make his exit and not return uh this game lets see yeah Max R is going to take a take a break you can see I just scraped him along his face but Maxim raino deserves a hand just what an effort by him this game you mentioned his family being here I mean smile on his face and you know we go to his shoot rounds we go to these practice Ive been to a ton of him guess whos the first guy at practice every day Maxim Reno and one of the last guys to leave theres a reason why hes been Music successful folks have to be pleased with the effort tonight we talk about Boston College coming more than 3000 for a couple games here in California this week how about Maxims folks almost 6000 miles from back home in Paris France yeah no thats thats getting it done but its an exciting time of the year to see your son play you you do what you have to do to see your son play McFarland on a step back and it almost bounced in but it falls to Talis turay whos getting some late run here now you mentioned something thats kind of interesting in my opinion Chris you say you you know you travel all this distance and and teams like Boston College I dont care if its West going east or east going west uh youre going to youre going to feel it you know your your legs arent going to be up under you right away and it doesnt matter what time you get in you got a time change its three hours youre on a different schedule so often times the teams that make these trips often times play better in the second of your two games so uh Cals going to have a little different BS in college if Cal has to place the bus in college that played the second half Cals going to have some problem so uh thats going to happen its happened all year long Earl Grants you know a veteran been around the block well Boston College desperately trying to find its way into that top 15 to qualify for the ACC tournament well theyd love to come out here and get a split doesnt matter if you get the front end or the back end uh Earl Grant talked to us about that today he said we we got to come out here and at least try to get a split and so thats going to be their goal but they can build on the second half they they put together some good numbers and some good efforts in the second half they really have and Stanford as we mentioned they played one of their better games Ive seen them play this year the Cardinal as Tay picks up the moving screen call well a little bit of a yeah a little bit lets uh Su player of the game huh yeah tonights player of the game brought to you by Wendys any guesses uh Im going to go with a guy from France okay his parents are here you got to give it to him parents came too far not to see him get player of the game displayed just about everything in his bag tonight been a tough night for Donald H Jr the reigning AC player of the week H six points on two of nine shooting coach yeah and hell be better mark my words he will be better against Cal Cals got to prepare for him because Stanford did a good job on him and I think hell bounce back from this game great players do hes too good a player because he hasnt had many down games so if youre uh if youre down your hand youre going to youre going to come back hes a competitor and hell do everything he can Donald H Jr to come back and help his team on Saturday but tonights been about Stanford senior day for Stanford coming up Saturday afternoon another one well have for you here on the ACCC Network as SMU comes to town itll be the second meeting between the Mustangs and Cardinal SMU beat Stanford by 24 points in Dallas last month well and thats a game you you kind of red mark on your calendar youd love the opportunity to get SMU in a lot of familiarity between Andy Enfield and Kyle Smith having coached against one another in the Pack 12 at their previous stops agar wall SWAT is an appropriate way for this game to end Stanford dominant defensively and the Cardinal roll the Eagles by 18 to improve the 152 inside Maples Pavilion now you take this
