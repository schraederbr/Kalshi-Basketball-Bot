championship last year now youll see you noticed in the starting lineups that uh a little bit of a change Ryan young in there for Mark Mitchell um that move made he wants to John sh wants to get a little more sizon there and also wants to light a little bit of a fire under Mark Mitchell not happy with his performance against Arkansas second start of the season for young Philip hsky in the paint put the shoulder out and scores yeah interesting matchup against the uh freshman Dongo um I think you see him a little bit more inside dangos got the quickness and size to match him out on the perimeter but uh not quite the strength to go inside against him May George on the handle cut off jumper Dango only his second attempt on the year and his first make how about that for the Freshman from senagal yeah Tom that was not in the scouting report that might not have been one of those scripted plays that you want to run through at the beginning of a game I wonder what Damon star what was going through his mind when he rose up for that strong Drive bounces off for Proctor and then a fight for the loose ball hell ball situation and the arrow will favor Georgia Tech and that is Proctor who is down for Duke and in some discomfort on that Baseline he had the initial Drive Mike and then the ball got tied up well and the thing you run into along there is theres camera people along there and its not a and he looked like he went into the stanion as well holding on to his ankle sophomore from Sydney Australia I mean there are people everywhere in this building this afternoon mamish Pavilion everybody wants a glimpse it its a yellow jackets who just had that huge win and now visiting Duke number seven of the nation and its uh its a big afternoon evening in Atlanta with Georgia and Alabama playing for the SEC Championship tonight so the medical staff checking on Tyrese Proctor double digit scorer this season and this its a big part of the Dukes offense running that high pick and roll right there and I cant see if he stepped on somebodys foot Landing right there which you know you you play this game long enough and you you wonder why that doesnt happen more often during the course of a game and thats not a good sign when they send somebody else out there to help you walk off the floor hopefully thats just preventative and not trying to put any weight on it awkward Landing for Proctor after that drive he had started every game so far this season he was averaging close to 12 points per per game and we hope its a good prognosis for him although he is still down on the Baseline this is a team voted preseason best in the ACC and good to see Proctor now sitting up on that Baseline trainer Jose fona out there um with Proctor too you you know you not hes their best hes their best passer got good size at 65 had a careerhigh 22 point points earlier this season against Bucknell being helped back towards the Duke bench area which is just to the right of our broadcast position here at mandish Pavilion see favoring the left lower Applause leg we got a freshman behind him another 65 player Caleb Applause Foster so coach shy has to shuffle the deck a little bit here early on in our first half of play second game of our CW Courtside Saturday in the ACC so glad that youre with us and we hope youre with us all season long the 1002nd meeting between Georgia Tech and Duke last year it was a Command Performance by the Blue Devils on the road to win the most recent meeting and Dongo around the rim and young outlt everyone its again a reason why hes in there early in the season Duke has had issues on the defensive glass this is roach has to send it back out filipowski into the corner thats a three that bounces off so McCain Miss fires here come the yellow jackets this is Miles Kelly its a three ball and talked to John shy last night at their shoot around and hes the guy hey this hes capable of a 30point afternoon you got a lock in on him he hits an early three does a lot for his confidence over 19 points per game for Kelly they dump it low to Young couldnt calculate the angle got it back and this time it also bounces off yellow jackets in transition two Point Blank misses oh another threee ball and that turn you know you get two easy layups that you miss and it turns into three points at the other end of the floor oasi Reeves Jr with a three his sixth of the season this is a Georgia Tech team that had not been shooting the ball really well early on in the year Drop It Low to Young prior to the bucket he traveled with the basketball Duke just one for five shooting in the early going in our first half for Coach Applause shy well and you look at it in their first game of the year they had 13 threes against Georgia Southern then they had a little bit of a drought made not eight threes in their game against Mississippi state three of three so far in this game Tom that one bounces off with the first Miss from long distance Kowski brings it up for Duke theyre five two on the season o and one away from Durham filipowski too strong Georgia Tech made eight threes on 27 tries in the win against number 21 Mississippi State on Tuesday heres another three from the corner and its Reeves Jr early on John sh is seen up Georgia Tech has come out and punch Duke in the m 120 run the threepointers fallen for the yellow Applause jackets two from Reeves Jr little bit of daylight at its money in the first half against the Blue Devils up by 10 for the Georgia Tech with an early 10point lead against the visiting Duke BL Devils four of five from be down the ark so far for Coach stms team to jump out to that lead keep in mind they shoot 30 as a team 13th in the conference mic not today against the Blue Devils so far well and thats the thing that youve got to you know you come out theyre under 30 you say all right make a couple and uh we might change The Scouting Report well now change The Scouting Report you you got to come out and contest that shot make them put it on the floor two of those threes from kaasi Reeds Jr who had made five in total prior to our game this afternoon Philip howski kept it alive McCain on the handle right in front of the Georgia Tech bench and set to be a turnover from roach second travel call and for the guys coming back with Georgia Tech this is a team that played mostly Zone principal last year uh theyre strictly a mantoman team right now they do a great job of helping one another second turnover by travel heard coach St me in the locker room telling his team we need an A effort so far Mark Mike the test has been pass with the effort so far in this first half and and John shy talked about the fact that his team is has been getting off to slow starts and thats been true to form here in the first four minutes High marks for the yellow jackets toana into the game wheres number 10 in white and old gold and blue and off to Kelly down the lane against filipowski held his ground you hold your ground and go straight up in the air you will not get a foul called roach in a congested area driver to the basket and a foul is Applause called 10 fou number danana picked up the f for Georgia Tech well and Jeremy roach in his last couple of games 11 of 14 from the free throw line so hes done a nice job of getting to the rim drawing some fouls and this is a good way to calm his team down get to the line slow the game down a little bit eat into that lead somewhat 73 on the season from the strike for jery roach the senior from leeburg Virginia that view from right behind the rim its such a rare sight these days to see a senior on the Duke Applause team one of two fight for the rebound one by Georgia techken danana Duke has a team this year Mike 72 from the line thats ninth in the ACC and this helps too that Philip hsky got in early foul trouble against Arkansas but against Applause back door Kelly dropped it off nice interior play that time Kellys been a good doing a good job getting inside sacko had the bucket for Georgia Tech McCain very difficult shot toana clears it Kelly stepp it into the three came up short roach on a three on two break McCain from the wing slicing through two Defenders had it blocked by sacko right to filipowski whistle stops play you know what that that early three by Kelly maybe not the worst shot in the world based on how theyve been shooting up to that point but it does result in a break and free throws down the other end of the Court yeah you can just you know and especially this team with a you know new system new coach things are going really well offensively the defensive intensity really picks Music up so the officials have come over to the monitor potentially to identify exactly who that foul was on filipowski standing at the free throw line thats Ron gr checking the monitor Char stock off first so thats on sacko First on him lowski at the line thats the thing too you know with you look at last years team and I dont really like to look back but with Lively out on the floor he took care of a lot of things in the interior and that took a lot of pressure off of Philip howski to defend inside and and thats where hes got to be really careful this year as far as being a rim protector especially early in the game TJ power has come in for Duke wheres number 12 hes a guy that could be an X Factor for this team especially on the offensive end of the floor really a terrific offensive player great long range shooter near steel lets see if that pilot light is lit for Mitchell yeah that was Mitchell who almost came up with that one shot clocks down to five a wide Miss from Debo Coleman uncharacteristic Foster brings it up and he has been all or nothing so far this year dvo Coleman Mitchell def filipowski tried to put it on the floor and that could be sacko again for his second early blocked in relatively short Applause Music order 12 CL so CL comes into the game a 12 for Coach ster Dango is in there as well number 11 in white roach the kick from the corner for three bounces off on the attempt by Caleb Applause Foster Duke shooting struggles continue in this first half trailing by 10 theyre just one of nine from the floor stur ofan fantastic player who comes off the bench for the yellow jackets and that pass intercepted Mitchell one on two Coleman trying to get back knocked around by Kelly and out of bounds and it will stay with the Blue Devils well and thats the one thing that Damon star stressed to us thas was that no live ball turnovers to Duke and that was only actually Georgia Tech they got back they got two guys back on Mitchell stopped the break made them set up in the half court for just joining us Tyrese Proctor had to leave with what appeared to be a lower leg issue and so Mitchell hits the shot and thats a huge shot and the teams have been giving him all sorts of room on his jump shot so thats going to be a big lift for his confidence mital averages in double digits with 11 points per game foul is called Foster his first thatll be on Foster first on him for the freshman in Harrisburg North Carolina Miles Kelly coming out of the game for Georgia Applause Tech Carter Murphy number four gr transfer from Air Force in the first year of the Georgia Tech program playing in his fourth game now coming in as a substitution Kyle sturdivan Miss Dango offensive glass Second Chance knocked around out of bounds itll stay with Georgia Tech good work from Claude couldnt come up with the points but they maintain possession Tai Claude Claud on the year 12 offensive rebounds 16 defensive rebounds so this is a this is a good team on the offensive glass you know I stressed earlier that Dukas had issues there in their games this season season Claud in the corner guarded by Young Georgia Tech is three and2 on the season three in one on their home floor Bobby kreman scor it goes out of bounds that lead back to Applause Duke Georgia Tech coming off of that win Tuesday Mike right here against number 21 Mississippi State first loss of the year for Mississippi State 6759 the final yeah team there was ranked in the top 25 that was a that was a really nice win in the ACC SEC challenge catch and release for three and roach rattles it home for Duke first made three of the game for Duke and this is a this is the lineup that probably hasnt seen a lot of time together on the floor for Duke Duke connects on almost eight threes per game that is sixth in the ACC up bounce and the bucket Dango has it for Georgia Tech hes hit a three and uh you know Ive watched some film with him hes got a a pretty raw offensive game but uh looked pretty skilled there hes got five points Reeves has six this is power firing away Coleman pulled it down miscommunication Foster Taps it ahead Mitchell treats everybody to the rim for the jam well was kind of lagging behind the play and uh but good bounce good def defense tap from behind Duke fortunate on that play So four points now for Mitchell coming off of that Duke bench but really the the start that he needed in this game driving strong to the basket and a whistle and foul Dango earning himself some free throws so it was Foster who tapped it up ahead to Mitchell eyeses for the rim and he slams it home on the CW seismic shift over the last few years in the league Mike Shashi being uh replaced by John shy and Jim beheim up in Syracuse and uh Roy Williams of Carolina um you know its just its you know and now we got still Jim Lena kind of you know right there and uh Leonard Hamilton down to Florida State probably the next to retire Tony Bennett the only one whos won a national championship Dango is at the free throw line The Freshman from senagal had only five free throw attempts this season coming into the ball game got one of those and hes up to six points only his third game of the year missed the first few with injury John Shire in his first year took his team all the way to an ACCC tournament championship in greensb North Carolina were headed to Washington DC this season Mitchell comes up Applause short fact they beat Tony Bennetts Virginia team 5949 in that final after beating pit and Miami on the way to the title game shot clock is down to 10 nearly Midway through our first half shot clock to five Claude down low and Dango off the glass well he is really blossoming good catching finish inside nice patience offensively by Georgia Tech in that possession hes up to eight points to lead the way in the first half fact he leads all scorers big Collision along that Baseline filipowski picked it up after Blakes was driving on the Baseline T charge number 11 by Dango picked up the personal foul watching Tech I really like the way they share the basketball you know nice interior passing and uh they have good movement on the uh perimeter guys as well they got some good threepoint looks early on that was a tough catch there by hango lowski at the free throw line for Duke plenty of student support of the building this afternoon the camish Pavilion I was talking about Georgia Tech shooting issues coming into this game Duke four of 16 one of five two of or three of six now from the free throw line in the game and Duke is a good shooting team Mike 48 as a team to start the day third in the conference you know what they havent gotten anything easy so far in this game its all been a a grind in the half Applause court Claude from the corner Philip housi guarding him and taking it away second block hes done a nice job of taking the body and getting the block offseason surgery on both hips the mobility is there and the leaping ability just made the defensive play then Foster hits at the other end for the Blue Devils nice job coming in giving them good minutes with Tyrese Proctor being out brocker had to leave awkward landing on his left ankle and had to come out of the game approaching the 9 Minute Mark right down the lane and Dango dropped it off claw finished it up Claude one of those hes a widebody guy played at a men major program Western Carolina so far translating pretty well at this level nice off bounce for Caleb Foster hes got Applause four now Claude is the senior from goldsb North Carolina first year in the Georgia Tech program and as Mike mentioned played at Western Carolina in the Southern Conference thats knocked away to filipowski Foster on the hop hand run down the lane and he drops it in time out Damon STM and Georgia Tech Blue Devils rolling and closing the gap on Georgia Tech in the first half back inside mamish Pavilion the Pacific Life game summary and recently its a 157 run for Duke Miles Kelly knocking down those early threes was a 122 run they Trail two to nothing and reeled off the next 12 points knocking down the threepointers and then Dred her on the drive and he came down awkwardly on that left ankle and that is the Pacific Life game summer presented by Pacific Life creating Financial Security for more than 150 years Dukes had some other guys come in though Tom and uh pick it up make some contributions blak that time nice Rush up the floor Foster come in and made some big baskets Mitchell a nice spark Off the Bench and uh good timeout that time by Damon stamar stopped the run here and for the first time over this last stretch duok has gotten some easy baskets in transition they made them right after I talked about their dismal start six of eight from the floor we are seated just within shouting distance of that bench Im not quite doing my golf call so well save that for the summertime Mike yes well I I you havent asked me to join you out on the course yet so along with the AllAmerican from duke Mike jinsky Im Tom wormy so glad that you are with us foul called on the play and Tom has seen my golf game so theres good reason for that Blakes picks up his first for duuk tring 2118 our outstanding CW college basketball crew also with us here in Atlanta Georgia and this fantastic venue for college basketball the cish Pavilion in its 11th season since the refurbishment from Alexander Memorial Coliseum which opened up back in 1956 steel Blakes oneonone stur ofan Blakes wins it five ball turnover especially out front that was just a lazy pass and then another one Mitchell strong to the glass Dango got back there and here comes Miles Kelly he runs it up for Georgia Tech head of steam dropped it off Saved along that Baseline momentarily by Claude and that ball hit the end line as it was knocked out of claudes hands and will stay with the yellow jackets I tell you what B Dango is just having a spectacular half I mean both ends of the floor saving that break offensively blossoming hes tied his season high with the eight points the Miss and filipowski has the rebound for Duke and theyre basically doing all the Georgia Tech is doing this basically without Miles Kelly hes only you we havent said his name much at all in this first half hes only got three points that three was very early in the half for Miles Kelly the lead is one after the threepoint attempt and missed from Mitchell last Duke lead was two to nothing right out of the gate here in Atlanta little follow away from roach Mitchell offensive glass and a Reload stepping behind the line for three lets see Jeremy roach lets see it that was through the little things time thats the recycle the offensive rebound by Mitchell kicks it out so many times you get that good look on the offensive rebound from behind the three line they fought all the way back qu triling 12 too early off the glass and good at Dango see now you know maybe in a regular Game Ear the season you give him that shot in this game you think you have to contest it now even though the backboard got in the way building on that season high with 10 points Kelly got a piece of that one jackets on the run all the way to the rim and it was knocked away defensively getting back was Blakes what a what a block de steel Kelly trying to reather hes got roach on his hip feverish action that was a six two guard folks who made that play claw had it knocked away tries again Philip hsky got a piece of it third block for Philip housei roach from the other side for three in and out Id say both teams are into the game right now cerent drops it off Claude into the corner and a Music three Reeves Jr it was off the clawed fingertips right to Reeves Jr and he pumps up a three ball I was watching Reeves Jr he is an incredible athlete watching him in warmups showing he can shoot the three as well hes made three of them in the game Blakes to the rim Tai Claude pulled it down foul called in the process and its going against Duke thats against Mitchell I believe foul 25 Mitchell is first it is the first on Mitchell heres the block look at that thats 62 folks thats an incredible weve seen some incredible defensive stops on both ends of the Applause floor Jaylen Blakes the junor Somerset New Jersey Music seeing action in every game this season so far and if he keeps doing that on the defensive end hell earn some playing time sturen directing traffic to work off that screen from the Applause Wana Kane picks up the foul is first you see you know when theyre playing that high screen with danana theyre not even guarding him young stay he really slid with the driver that whole time with Sturman really didnt need to pick up that foul sturdivan came off the bench against Mississippi State with 12 points in 12 minutes and now hes in the Box Score as power comes back in for Duke a breather for filipowski you see you know John shy when with Philip palowski you know the the under fourminute timeout is coming and hes given him rest about a minute before those breaks take him out let him sit down now and then get under the four minute timeout and then let him finish out the half third of it now8 of 10 from the free throw line on the season George attack to the midst of a 70 run after the free throws from Applause Sturman working the perimeter with roach Blakes comes out of the Corner Kelly was ready shot clock is at seven roach just beyond the free throw line well no uh not flustered at all with that shot clock and I really like the uh the the length of Georgia Techs Defenders out on the perimeter they also they do a nice job with helping in the driving Lanes long distance threee ball Miles Kelly yeah that was hey guys I hadnt been a part of the offense in a while here I need to take a shot second three of the game for Kelly who averages over 19 points per game in the top 10 of the ACC Blakes misses McCain runs it down to the corner comes strong out of that corner nice touch on the shot McCain uh I really like his offense uh you know he hes hes had some struggles in some games um you know you almost wonder why he takes two pointers hes 13 of 29 from three coming into this game five of 19 from two that was his first bucket of the game averaging close to eight per game for Duke shot clocks inside of 10 for Georgia Tech the runner Miles Kelly yeah hes hes looking to finish out the half strong eight points now for Miles Kelly had 22 against Mississippi State and made four threepointers two strong out of the corner third of it Miles Kelly also had 12 rebounds in the win against Mississippi State back to Duke roach cross it over all the way to the rim highlight move from roach no help in the back that time and uh danana is the guy who should be there there was no backside help eight points now for Jeremy roach had 22 in the loss at Arkansas first ever trip two Arkansas for Duke and they came away with a loss well take a timeout Georgia Tech has the lead 3329 uh three great programs and teams in Pittsburgh Miami and Virginia um and you know for our team with one guy returning in Jeremy roach from the year before to see each of the different players that stepped up I was just so proud I was just really proud and happy for our team in that Music moment cutting down the Nets in Greensboro North Carolina the 22nd alltime ACC tournament championship for the Duke program thats the most in ACC history 14 six in ACC play for Duke a season ago they were 160 overall at home last year second round exit against Tennessee and and its nice to see you know its not an automatic oneand done anymore its nice to see guys making that decision you know the nil money Im sure has plays a role in that and uh you know John has uh and Kyle has you know other things he Im sure that theres unfinished business Music guys whose last names and in ski have done well in Durham so you know Im sure he wants hopes that that plays well into it at number 43 for the Gman hanging in the rafters Cameron Indoor Stadium were going to get there a couple of times this month G man yeah looking forward to it as always special place for me part of our double headers on the CW CW Courtside Saturday shot clock Running Out on Georgia Tech and a miss from Kelly nice job that time defensively by Mitchell staying down on all the pump fakes Dukes made three of its last five shots to lowski the spin Coleman knocked it away momentarily musling his way and missing Dango clears it up to Coleman nice job by him staying down defensively George stepping into a three roach pulls it down Dango has not played like a freshman defensively in this game so far Georgia Tech has missed its last two shots but had been shooting 50 from the floor roach had it altered by Reeves Jr Dongo grabbed that hes shaking up a little bit trotting up the court seems to be okay for the moment heres Miles Kelly eight points in the first half for Kelly leading score for Georgia Tech has it taken and drive Miles Kelly to the glass double digits now for Kelly Gman hes got 10 and Danga with 10 points as well re with nine good Balan scoring Kellys gone over 20 points scoring three times this season well on his way in the first half Kapowski with the shot clock inside of 10 got doubled got it back laid it up an in good finish with the left hand hes so good in there hes got great balance and footwork for a big guy game high 26 points in the loss at Arkansas 23 in the second half after foul trouble in that first half tell this a nice defensive half for Georgia Tech Duke sitting on 31 miles Kelly has the last seven points its only about a second Difference game in shot Kelly trying to add to his own run of scoring missed it and thatll do it in the first Applause half 3531 the lead for Georgia Tech getting the ice strapped on he came out in clutches pasi only four field goal attempts now seven hes got seven seven rebounds three blocks in that first half so getting things done on the other Kapowski on the Block double team taken away jackets yeah theyre going to come big on the double team with him from the weak side and uh that time didnt have good balance Georgia Tech shot 46 as a team in that first half above their season average of 39 which was at the bottom of the conference in the ACC and its Reeves Jr with a three ball this saw the first half started with Georgia Tech lighting it up from three Reeves coming into the game a 29 shooter from three hes made four of them in the game had made five All Season prior to today shot clocks ATT 10 roach needs a safety valve Kapowski late in the clock turn around three bounces off young able to bat it around Foster passed his Defender into the teeth of the defense and a foul against the yellow jackets he really got bailed out with a foul that time had no chance to make that shot and I you know going into this game and looking at that match up in dong Dongo against Phil Pas said man this is really going to be in Dukes favor so far Nago is clearly winning this matchup Fosters at the free throw line 56 of the season from the line first year head coach even stod that student section trying to disrupt the concentration of the Blue Devils at the free throw line 102 Foster lets see and Duke in in games at times has really pushed the pressure up the floor lets see if they if they do this in the second half Kelly flips it into the corner hand off from danana Miles Kelly shot clock at eight bounces out of bounds and will stay with Georgia Tech danana they can really play five on four defensively they can they can let him wander not concentrate on him too much Kelly caning to kind play young can kind of play center field a little bit Kelly down low and Dango lays it in with two seconds on the shot clock and he was fouled Im talking about a guy maturing right before eyes and he just hes not hes not going to be a pick and pop guy just rolling through the basket great catch great Applause finish 12 points in the game game of the chance at the old school threepoint Applause play 69 freshman now really you look at his form at the free throw line you got to think that percentage as he gets there more often hes going to go up that only attempted five free throws young banging inside the help came from Dongo and it goes out of bounds and will stay with do luk Dongo all over the court Mike lets keep an eye on him that he played 15 minutes in that first half lets see if fatigue starts to catch up with him Kowski wide open three Off the Mark and that shot has not been there for him inside the ELO danana with the slam young fake and Applause basket this game being played at a Breakneck Pace between Georgia teeken Applause Duke inside and Dango again control Mikeys got 15 points in the ball game and he leads everybody with those 15 roach in trouble you know you look at the numbers Tom and when Miles Kelly had come in he was taking 35 of Georgia Tech shots its other people who are beating dke in this game other people are getting involved in the offense McCain in the paint came up short young grabs it Road steps into the three straight away got fouled on the threepoint attempt and The Challenge from Nate George theres the look and you get that you get the high screen and uh hes just going to look he like I said hes just going to pick and roll straight to the basket Jeremy Ro at the line shoting those are just two great finishes going to the rim two great feeds from Nate George as well Mike he and and he I thought he you know he had in the coming into this game had made some risky was he had one assist six turnovers in his early action but uh so far in this game making better decisions with the ball and uh you know D sire said that you know the team loves playing with him at the point hes going to live with his freshman mistakes but uh you know how do you grow you dont grow in practice you grow out on the uh on the floor in a game like this Applause one more free throw for roach whos up to 13 points thats the fif time this season hes hit double digits you see Coleman coming in for Georgia Tech Dango comes out Young comes out for Duke as well roach is one of the tri captains for the Blue Devils second time time hes had that honor got them all from the free throw line 54th time in his Duke career to get to double digits and scoring up to 14 now for roach George dribbled into trouble Kelly Bells him out well who would have thought coming into this game that Dongo being out as a break for Applause Duke fou Char number 25 just picked up his second personal Music foul Dongo with 15 points sitting on that Georgia Tech bench shattered his season high of eight got that done early on in the first half with his hard work getting a breather now Miles Kelly hes got that under 16 time out coming wes see how wes see how long coach thire has him on the bench before he gets him back again Nate George on the dribble deep into the shot clock touch foul by Mitchell thats number three Mike couple of quick ones on Mark Mitchell sophomore from Kansas City Kansas you can guard that position but you got to have a little clock awareness danana the transfer from NC State first here of the Georgia Tech program number 10 in white this is Applause Kelly Reeves Jr kept it alive for the reset George looking over at Damon stmy played in the final four as a player at Arizona shot clock is down to six intercepted pass roach tried to get it up ahead ball was deflected McCain now on the dve Drive pass toana lays it in with the left hand nice take had a good angle inside good strong take its a little different when its just one of those guys out on the floor as a rim protector instead of both of them filipowski gets a piece of that his fourth block McCain stops at the threepoint line Reeves Jr High for the board into the corner Coleman out of the corner Coleman Reeves Jr hits the Applause jumper well you know we havent given him enough love in this game quietly 14 points for him has only missed one shot from the Applause floor Ki Reeves from Mak Georgia the junr big pick up in the portal McCain underneath springing free for another two from aain sixpoint game hes done some good work inside really a solid build solidly built Applause guard John Shire leaving Mitchell in there with the three fouls shot clock at seven for Miles Kelly stepping around roach flips it back out George this is a threepointer off the line you live with that shot although I dont know you might throw The Scouting Report out the window in this in this game with George attch and Nate George shooting just 33 from Beyond The Arc this Applause season see that you know when and look at with Mitchell whenever he has the ball theres nobody within sight of him Mitchell drives against Reeves trying to get it back for a second effort against danana and it got fouled and thats what hes got to do in that situation make up the distance get to the rim danana picks up his third Mitchell at the free throw line will we up shot four of four from three 14 points for him and uh indongo 15 points six of eight from the floor hes hited three in this game has been rebounding blocking shots uh terrific game for him as well and uh you know one re re the transfer from Florida Dongo the originally committed to ruter and then when SAR got the job came down Applause Music here so those two players supplying the offensive effort along with the threepoint shooting for Georgia Tech as Music well Music just again second half minutes Dongo with 15 minutes in that first half only his third game back a very emotionally highly charged game like this keep an eye on him in these last 13 minutes see where Damon stamar can buy him a rest here and there Mitchell at the free throw line talking about arrest hes young hes a freshman Coleman got the basketball in the miss by Mitchell from the free throw line so Reeves is up to 14 points Dango has 15 thats a season Applause High fivepoint game a feeling hes going to be blowing up that season High a few times hes got the basketball right now shot clock is at eight stur Music ofan into the corner thats too strong on the threepoint attempt from claw that possession kind of went nowhere right from the start and 1 second about enough time for a tap and this is where you got to keep a body on the big Applause guys off the inbounds Dongo tried to make the play the ball never hit the rim see a shock violation thats where Id like to see a rule change for for either team cuz that the team gets a possession that that takes a rush up the floor away from the defense on that they the defensive team clearly has possession and it takes a play away from them it takes a a good defensive possession Applause away this is roin traffic filipowski I tell you what Georgia Tech has done a great job on filipowski pass back behind McCain from Foster out of bounds and back to Georgia Tech next week CW Courtside Saturday returns an exciting double header first we head to blackburg heres Virginia Tech host Valpo and then its off to Cameron Indoor Stadium is number seven Duke welcome Charlotte to durm CW Courtside Saturday continues next week at 12 Eastern 9m Pacific only on the CW interesting John Shire try and give him Sean Stewart some minutes out on the floor with Mitchell with the three fouls entry pass filipowski around his Defender and it stays Applause down hes going to put Stewart on dong Dongo thats going to be an interesting match up Stewart can guard at five five positions he got a switch now St of and fancy dribble and hits the jumper a little late getting out on that cerent is a better offensive player than George is certainly a better shooter great production Off the Bench from stur of who averages over 20 minutes coming off of that bench Duke and Georgia Tech on the CW we got yeah kyil Housey last year great run through the tournament for Duke joh CH first year Zion team went all the way to the championship in Charlotte of 2019 they uh they they need him to get going in this game for sure only two points in the second half so far McCain for three too strong and the struggles continue from Beyond The Arc for Duke they are now two of 14 on threepoint tries Coleman driving Coleman scoring and hell go to the free throw line only second shot of the game in first made Applause basket second foul on roach and you look at his scoring this season so far Tom

scoring Philip hsky is well under his average Jo George big bucket from Nate George first of the night for him as well freshman from Toronto Ontario Canada has given Georgia Tech a fivepoint lead inside of 6 minutes to go in regulation Foster for three in front of his own bench its a twopoint game that was a nice find though by Philip housi pulled up really didnt have anything in the Applause lane Claude tipped it to danana keep in mind last season 8643 was the win for Duke on this floor Miles Kelly misses danana the offensive board trying to back it down on filipowski George who just scored his first two points of the game moments ago with the shot clock at seven hell fire up a three danana over the top I think theyre going to call that on Applause roach third on roach see that time he got caught on the switch on danana but where he got caught in the problem is that they took the shot and and he got called in the foul on the Block Applause out young is coming in for Music Applause Duke filipowski coming out just eight points Mike for filipowski on three of eight shooting and hes missed all three there threepoint attempts and no foul trouble for him they didnt have a

Virginia Tech hos Valpo and then its off to Cameron Indoor Stadium number 72 welcome Charlotte to Durham CW Court sign Saturday continues next week 12 Eastern 9 Pacific only on the CW could be some shifting around in the uh in the top 25 Purdue went down um Northwestern in overtime beat him Chris Collins has done a terrific job up at Northwestern Yukon lost to Kansas as well all you got to do Mike is follow that giant basketball to all the sites where we go this season on Courtside Saturday on the Music CW follow the bouncing basketball what an afternoon this has been in Atlanta Tom wormy Mike kinsky our outstanding CW Courtside Saturday for crew with you from mamish Pavilion Atlanta Applause Georgia last year Duke won 8643 lopsided win not this afternoon Foster guarded by Reeves foul on the play First on Reeds fou so five team fouls on Georgia Tech start six for Duke yeah for the most part this game has not been played at the free throw line I mean Duke is this will be the uh 14th and 15 free throw of the game for them and they have left some points there eight of 14 now Foster at the free throw line D slodar going a little offense for defense getting Coleman back in to claw Applause empty possession but saved by felski tapping that one back Applause out 18 points for roach leads the way trying to work off the filipowski screen battle for the loose ball filipowski he hit the deck got the offensive board went to the floor Applause Music charg number three is first first on Coleman sends Philip pasy to the free throw Applause Music line Dongo you saw him on the bench there for Georgia Tech had to leave momentarily Caleb Foster has responded with some pretty good minutes hes had to step in and play for proor with the injuries got 12 points Applause I think that might have been you know after that monster dunk that Dongo had might bit of cramp we talked about the heavy minutes in this game Can it can happen to a freshman not a lot of fluids and also hit the stantard awkwardly earlier in the half as well and have to head over to the Georgia Tech bench for a rest it appears that he might be be ready to pop back into this ball game Kowski at the free throw line canay our Applause game 415 to go in regulation 60 60 Georgia Tech and Duke lets see if uh we havent heard from Miles Kelly in a little bit lets see if he starts to be a presence in the last four minutes just the second tie of our game Coleman out of the corner with the jumper B Georgia yeah thats he offense for defense we talked about a good substitution by Damon stmy five points for Coleman after that jumper roach got tangled up with George and a foul called on George well step aside for a moment got to manage both ways and thats what people forget and thats a coach who talks from experience played for Arizona in the final four Mike decorated NBA career rookie of the year spent 5 years at the University of the Pacific as their head coach and here he is how about this your first ACC game on the sideline youre playing to and its a twopoint game late and you know its interesting too that for his most of his life was a West Coast guy and now finds himself in the Atlanta Coast Conference and he you know we talked about it he told us everything Ive heard about the Atlanta Coast like what brought him to Georgia Tech although names dont mean anything anymore were all over the board the footprint expanding in the ACC one more free throw for roach could tie us Music up ACC is going out west with K and Stanford SMU also next season in the ACC Duke is the defending champs from the tournament a season ago and roach has tied our game at 62 how about 20 points Jeremy Applause roach second straight game with 20 or more for roach knocked away was deflected by power at the end of the Mississippi State game Damen stmy went with both sturdivan and George out there Im going to be wondering if he comes back with sturdivan as a ball handler just a lot of turnover a lot of sloppy play for Georgia Tech in the last few minutes and that game against Mississippi State which was ranked 21st of the nation was a win for Georgia Tech this is Mitchell knocked away and Dango defensively he has been everywhere that was a terrific find Inside by filipowski Reeves dropped it low couldnt connect then Dango is no we got it overturned initially calling in the Baseline for Georgia Tech but overturned and were not under 2 minutes so it cant be looked at Duke basketball tied at 62 what a way to start CW Courtside Saturday second game of our double header is going right down to the wire Duke and Georgia Tech first of two meetings this year Philip hsky dropped it off this time to Mitchell fouled on the jam well maybe coach shy lit that pilot light not starting Mark Mitchell we talked at the open about Philip hsky becoming a passer and he has made some terrific deliveries in this game Mitchell at the free throw line one of two from the stripe of the game filosi volleyballs it out to Mitchell roach wants the basketball its the second time Duke has not been not good at the free throw line but theyve gotten bailed out twice by tap outs Duke ahead for the first time since its LED 2321 in the first half roach elevating dropping it off to Mitchell for the slam from roach hes getting a technical foul for taunting reaction from Dansby Swanson in the crowd yeah that thats a thats a I cant argue with the call watch the play Applause here he point I I cant argue with that call and you know what youre youre happy about the way youre playing but you gave up you gave back one of the points technical foul on Mark Applause Mitchell Kellys at the free throw line and you gave you just negated what you did down the other end of the floor so the lead for Duke is now two after the Kelly free throws on the technical against Mitchell after the Applause jam some Afters from Mitchell and thatll cost him a couple of free throws and it is Georgia Tech basketball and its Fourth personal foul George has it for Georgia Tech approaching the twominute threshold of Regulation Applause Coleman Kelly the drive soft bounceing score Miles Kelly anything you got to make him go left but a great soft finish tied at 66 third tie of the game roaches driving drops it off Philip palowski hangs and scores absorb the contact thats what say Greg against a shot blocker took it took took the body and then made the Finish 12 points for filipowski twopoint game how you finish Dango ties it at 68 and a timeout taken Damon STM and George Applause Music attch well Id seen Nate George make some really suspect L passes coming into this game but that was right on Music point I mean this is just great a little brush screen got a little back screen from Coleman great catch and finish I mean thats theyre not playing like freshman right Applause now heres the reset tied at 68 two timeouts for Duke one for Georgia Tech both teams in the bonus at the moment Dango what an afternoon Mike 10 points in the first half nine in the second half M George eight assists look at coach STM he needs some liquid refreshment its taking a lot out of him this afternoon and this is game one in the ACC on the Applause schedule after Duke won this game between the teams here on this quarter season too handily 8643 and has dominated the series splid won 16 the last 17 Georgia Techs last win March of 2021 they W here at home in overtime against Duke 8177 one minute remaining shot clock at 10 Mitchell lost the Applause handle that ball gets tied up on the court and the arrow favors Georgia Tech Mitchell trying to do too much off the bounce that time they were actually giving him more respect playing up near him sub Music for tied at 68 23 seconds between shot and game clock so you just have to play solid defense if youre Duke mate George H you nango JS it oh baby and nango gives Georgia Tech a twopoint Music lead Ro chops into the paint trying to feed it to Mitchell off of his fingertips Georgia Tech basketball pick and roll just unbelievable play by Georges attch hes got 21 points Mike unbelievable 21 for number 11 Bango how about those two Applause freshman four turnovers in the half for Duke they only had two in the first half Georgia Tech and Miles Kelly has the ball theres only a couple of second difference between game and shot and they foul George roach comes out and fouls him hes Applause fourth okay George has not been to the line in this game is only three of five on the year but throw out all that 22 seconds left you have a twopoint Applause lead as a team Georgia Tech from the free throw line nine of 10 in the game Mike yeah one and one and they entered the game as the worst free throw shooting team in the league Miss from George timeout Duke 182 seconds to Applause go so now Duke and Georgia Tech each have one timeout so heres the most recent sequence Philip Housey great pass to Mitchell and then roach got it to Mell now watch after the play does that does that play does that taunting technical Loom large giving away two points and its a twopoint ball game right now and then the pick and roll has been fabulous for Georgia Tech George and and Dango have combined on several occasions tonight well that one putting the jackets up by two 7068 was a fourpoint halftime lead for Georgia Tech each team has a timeout each team in the bonus the possession arrow favors Duke I think right now despite the shot blocking you try to get something quick hitting going at The Rim or we can just look at the play being drawn up and you notice the Coach K logo is still on that eras board double header continues next week CW Courtside Saturday we hope to match the excitement and intensity of this game all season long on the CW we thank you for joining us SC first Saturday in the ACC and the first on the CW court side Saturday what a game it has been remember Mike Duke took the lead with 221 to go 6662 Georgia Tech on an 82 run since four points from Kelly and Ando Duke with the basketball in the final 15 seconds trailing by two roach looking for some help wants a timeout and gets it 57 on the game clock yeah well defended Kelly got the switch and then just just a much he got a big defender on roach he had nowhere to go inside well defended by Georgia Tech so Duke just used its last timeout with 57 seconds to go in regulation Blue Devils have owned this Applause series now me person Al I have been of the opinion on the road go for the threepoint shot and the win now lets see how uh lets see with with power in there and they looks like they just put McCain into the game lets see what Duke dials up here so theyre four of 16 from threepoint distance in the Music game roaches made two of those so they added 210 of a second to the clock 59 seconds to go in regulation I mean heart pounding excitement inside memish Pavilion Duke has the basketball Georgia Tech has the lead but unfortunately theyre theyre inbounding from a really tough place to get that Applause done Foster on the inbounds roach driving tough shot swallowed up defensively Kelly had the ball filipowski sent them to the floor theres only 3 seconds to go Mike Duke never got the shot away no and they were they were not looking for the three either they were looking for something inside in the tie Music Georgia Tech one here in 2021 in ot3 seconds away from Victory Kelly on the free throw line puts him up by three and you miss so what and this was you know this was all done Miles Kelly having uh not his best not his aame this afternoon 16 points for Kelly game over fourpoint game nothing Duke can do George attack wins it over number seven Duke 72 68 what a
