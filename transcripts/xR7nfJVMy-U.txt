Music so post and basili will be principal factors in this second meeting of the Year between Earl Grants Eagles who are 11 and 13 and 58 they have won three of their last five Virginia techs won three of their last four all in this building and Clarence Armstrong tonight on the whistle with AJ Desai and Keith Kimball the Eagles won 7065 in overtime its one of three conference games in the first 99 band that have gone to overtime and right away Devin McLaughlin on the board to start the night for Boston College West and that was the screen and role play that just really flummoxed Virginia Tech in that game in December and it was McLaughlin he scored this season High against Virginia Tech sure did 18 points and seven rebounds on the way to the win here is basily and the soft jump hook puts the Hokies on the board you saw the silly was matched up against McLaughlin McLaughlin is a little too small to handle him that close to the basket without help Zachary with post here is Makai Ashton Langford Demar Langford did not make the trip he still bothered by a knee right side three ball away a league Bay young freshman from Minneapolis and a whistle and a foul on Boston College and itll be on the seven footer from Amsterdam in the Netherlands Quentin post and thats a big foul early in the game and Wes Boston College theyve improved their threepoint shooting percentage recently but they are not a very good threepoint shooting team and so I think thats a win if Virginia Tech can get the Eagles to shoot the three that early in the clock Couture Music Dan he is now 18 of his last 34 from behind the line well and he is the guy who can really shoot at West hes got that fast release you just cant give him any room hokeys trying to help on the screen game out front of leak Bay entry pass and post Ian vasilio a little double team from Collins Zachary off the open look listen again you take a risk when you double team because they can compost is a good passer can kick it out for a three but again BC is not a good threepoint shooting team the silly has that one Bound Away for Prince a league Bay and here is Zachary this is a good now there are some veteran pieces on the Boston College team as you see post score on a soft turnaround off the Baseline but boy Earl Grants got a lot of foundation laid in his first year nearly two full Dan well he really does and hes got big strong kids who really play hard inside theres mutts sharp cut to the basket for Justin mutts but how about that pass West yep a little bit of a chess match early right absolutely each team is trying to figure out how to handle the other one streams look at post little reroute over the top of basily throttles out for MJ Collins plays with a mask tonight hes gotten banged in the chops at Miami and then knocked around in the nose last weekend and mutts inside hell draw a foul and thatll be the second on BC Earl Grant 46 year old native of North Charleston South Carolina went to school in Milledgeville Georgia Georgia College great fun to talk to program Builder Dan if he did you know hes kind of set the table in his 10year College of Charleston he won 140 games there I was on McLaughlin by the way his first Wes he does a great job relating to the players he does a great job getting him to play hard you know he were talking to him this afternoon about the service component of Boston College and the Jesuit education and hes all in support of that and he seems to be a perfect fit for Boston College and the Eagles are having some success sure are but they Trail five here just better than three minutes gone and a league Bay couldnt finish and heres Padula boy what how terrific was he Saturday against the Cavaliers in the win here at the castle Vasily trying to roll inside turns on McLaughlin scores McLaughlin cant guard him without help Wes nope early seven point lead for Virginia Tech sixnothing run by the Home Squad McLaughlin post left alone and rattles in the three thats his 13th of the year and hes got five of the seven whereas he is an outstanding threepoint shooter nice pass for much remember post playing with the foul he did as good a job as you could hope for but its six early points for Justin mutts mutts I mean he can be very effective down in there and post has to be careful pokies have hit five of their first six BC just three of their first seven mantoman defense for each team both set the screen Ashton Langford threw all the way in the corner and McLaughlins triple rings fifth threepointer of the year for Devin McLaughlin I see you looking at the charts look in here but you know interestingly enough Wes before that shot he was one for two in ACC play yeah so hes a lot of high volume guy but youve given some room and he cant he can obviously knock it down five for seven now in threepoint shots is Devin McLaughlin sophomore from coming Georgia theres mutts a long range shot a league Bay the rebound theres the double team off the screen look at post nicely done comes to a jump stop and a bounce pass they got blocked inside but silly rejecting McLaughlin what a great job by Hunter Couture to make posts stop Collins backroom Miss and the rebound for post the Boston College just doesnt go away Wes there are gritty bunches we said theyll try to work the ball inside and and basily is going to commit the foul on the bounce pass and shot by post Earl Grants gonna get some free throws when we come back early threepoint lead for the Hokie from Boston College won 7065 in overtime Dan theres some glaring things in here number one Virginia Tech struggled that night shooting threes and Boston College got 15 points off 15 Virginia Tech tournaments at the time Virginia Tech was averaging fewer than nine turnovers a game but you see their Boston College scored 15 points off turnovers they scored 13 Second Chance points and West both of those are huge in an overtime game particularly when Virginia Tech shot the ball so poorly from three Earl Grants team had only nine turnovers that night heres post at the line hes a 94 free throw shooter Applause and thats just his third Miss of the year hes now 32 of 35 at the line and if you want thats on me that is not on you Applause missed them both now that may be on you okay threepoint lead for Virginia Tech Wes the one thing that weve seen so far is a lack of turnovers mutts trying to square up and get into the lane and McLaughlins going to get called here thats his second well mutz is such a tough matchup Wes I mean we saw mutts take the Syracuse Zone apart when we were here with his passing sure did much took Virginia apart over the weekend with his passing so post and McLaughlin are out Bickerstaff has checked into the ball game as has CJ Pena who plays uh for the first time in three games Dan yeah and he was the guy that was getting a lot of minutes early theres a pass stolen and were going to get an offensive foul against Couture off the ball from AJ Desai who tickets Virginia Tech with their second foul and the first on the senior from Orlando first turnover of the ball game belongs to Virginia Tech and for Virginia Tech you dont want to give the ball away but if you do you dont want Boston College to get out and get easy baskets thats it heres Pena hell fire from Deep off the back of the rim recovered Ashton Lankford kick out thats Madsen line drive three hit the front of the rim Mason Madsen is a transfer from Cincinnati out of Rochester Minnesota and he has shot the three much better in the last couple of games Fall Away by mutts that follow is a tough shot Wes carried LeBron James to the NBA career Mark last night but were talking about LeBron James yeah theres a lot of things that are tough for everybody else that arent very tough for him thats right heres Zachary working against Padula hokey seem to be handling the screens okay early Dan except for that one play theres Matson on the drive cant finish Lynn Kidd off Mike Youngs bench in to replace bazilly and then the ball almost got turned over on the outlet pass and we saw Zachary and Padula crash here and well get a chance to tell you that coming up tomorrow night Thursday night womens basketball you know what that means right double header Lance white takes Pittsburgh to South Bend to see number 10 Notre Dame and starts our coverage at six oclock and then what tough Monday night for Wes Moore in NC State now theyre headed to the Joel Coliseum to see Wake Forest at eight oclock coverage right here on acc Network presented by Ally and also streaming live on the ESPN app so Zacharys gonna come out of the ball game I think he banged his shin or his knee and both he and Padula are pretty big guys man bulky guys so that was some Collision Chaz Kellys gonna check in the 65 freshman from Houston he wears double zero for Earl Grant and here is John Camden whose minutes have gone up since the uh departure of uh Darius Maddox from The Hokey roster to tend to some family business heres Couture another three and the rebound tucked away by Becker staff Couture does such a great job getting open Wes but Boston College theyre chasing him yep Ena heres Matson now for Kelly will wheel through and look out what happened here we got to put up on a foul Sean Padula will be tagged with his first Kelly is the guy whos pretty quick with the basketball chicken back in for Virginia Tech number two well Chaz Kelly is a guy whos gotten double figure minutes in each of the last three games so young guys who you can count on for that kind of investment in the ball game coming on for Earl Grant Matson triple from the corner spins out again Wes I think if the more threepoint shots Boston College takes I think its a big Advantage for Virginia Tech because BC just doesnt make a lot of them this game is scoreless in the last four minutes Padula now in a bounce to mutts inside against picker staff it fell off the front of the rim heres Pena back for Kelly quick look inside bicker staff catching bucket TJ Bickerstaff senior transfer from Drexel and Wes what happened is mutts stayed down at this end it was a while before he got up and Boston College took advantage bicker staff was the guy mutz is supposed to guard and he wasnt there to guard him Hokies have missed their last five shots on the floor after a hot start only lead by Point heres Padula shaking on Matson into traffic cant finish Lynn Kidd Taps it home for the home team thats a tough shot and what Padula did by missing that shot West is he drew four Defenders to him so there was nobody to block out kid Virginia Tech to a threepoint lead back door cut mad son get the roll first points for Mason Madsen who played 22 minutes on Saturday night in the home loss to Syracuse has a perfect read by Matson Camdens trying to deny him and he just went back door old school basketball yeah sure is mutts for Camden out of the corner of three fifth three of the year for John Camden Applause and the Hokies really like his threepoint shooting ability I think his numbers will go way up as he gets more time yeah averaging 19 minutes in the last three games heres a catch and bicker staff will get the basket second field goal for bicker staff free throw for the Eagles and a chance to draw within three when we come back were gonna check Joey brackets too in the ACC next on the eight and above lines Clemson North Carolina still hanging on you see Virginia Tech despite that seven game losing streak and their four and eight record in the conference their net ranking is good at 50 they have three quad one wins and you see Joey brackets has them at 80th overall and of course that gives you an example how far they have to go according to Joe because theres only 68 teams get invited yeah here is Bickerstaff after the foul going to break to try and complete the threepoint play and he does is now a 135 run by Boston College Wesson one of the things you hear people say is this is a game Virginia Tech cannot afford to lose and based on the metrics the net that that is a true statement but its a little bit unfair to Virginia Tech into the league for that matter because Boston College earned their net which is what everybodys talking about when you cant afford to lose the game in November and December when post wasnt playing right so this is an entirely different Boston College team now a fourth foul on BC the first on the Minneapolis freshman of League Bay and I would offer you this Earl Grant I thought very candid with us he had to make a decision on Clinton post going into the season the injury elements you know if we if we gave him the rest would he be ready in January so he took that risk he bit the bullet if you will and Dan Quentin post comes into this game tonight hes 11th in the league and scoring in 12th and rebounding and he is a factor so to be clear the net they dont have any conscience of BC with or without Quentin post when it comes to the data point leaping catch of the ball and a strong take but a league Bay couldnt finish wait that was an odd looking play it was like even after he caught the ball Virginia Tech didnt know where he was 13 to shoot off the reset Ashton lankfords had a hard time getting a shot post is not and he just drew miligel poteats first foul 15 foul on Virginia Tech pretty good entry pass here well Boston College has done a nice job getting the ball inside and Poteet didnt get off that screen very quickly basily was there thought Poteet was going to get there in time and so he left post and here hes missed three free throws in a row thats more free throws that hes missed in succession than he missed all year coming in right Applause second one knocked that one down six six for post keep in mind Wes that Boston College is a team that in conference play scores 60 percent of their points from two yeah they are 15th in the league in threes per game at 52 they have one two tonight McLaughlin and post Couture meanwhile had that just glanced the rim and then post a rebound Wesson thats why Boston College would like to play one of these tight grinder low scoring kind of games because if youre only making five threepoint baskets a game its hard to score a lot of points Kelly back up top post couldnt hang on there is Poteet with the takeaway much better job by Poteet that time Couture and Pena runs that down unless those are the kind of shots that Couture usually makes at least when we saw him last inside post the catch dunk rattled out post comes back and gets it and scores it again how about that you dont see that happen the dunk right about the guy got it and he laid it right back in eight for Quentin post West into Boston College who trailed 114 at the start of the game has got it tied at 20 basily and the rebound for a league Bay well Wesson Virginia Tech shooting the three very poorly theyve had they have had some success inside theyre going to need to go back to that Poteet trying to be physical on the catch of post now League Bay heres Kelly he clutched against Collins now fires and PCS in front ninth three of the Year by Chaz Kelly gives the Eagles the lead Wes thats only his third three in ACC play he comes in shooting 12 percent against the league BC with the lead first since it was two nothing Boston College is in a Zone six nothing run by the Eagles the last couple minutes and petite sailed that one off the floor so Chaz Kelly III Dan has put BC in front well Earl Grant said that he was a really good point guard and again in Coliseum and Dan what always looks innocent can sometimes be totally different Jaden Zachary is done for the night with a leg injury so he will not return for the Eagles and thats a tough one for Earl Grant Squad this guys been a big Cog in what theyre doing here and the month of February and certainly in January as well you can see that ice pack on his right chin no I was here and ACC play hes their assist leader hes number two in steals you know hes six feet two 215 pounds hes a tough physical guy Kelly tees up another three wow Jazz Kelly has buried a couple threes here in the last three possessions Wes weve been talking about however you know Boston College isnt a really good threepoint shooting team but theyre shooting the three better than Virginia Tech tonight largest lead of the ball game here for the Eagles who trailed 114 to start and now in front six and mutts this is where theyve had success Wes post trying to defend and one and itll be a bigger than that because its number two oh no theyre going to call a league Bay for the reach I thought for a moment post was going to get tagged with his second and its dead its on Prince a league Bay itll be his second its five on BC mutz has got his third field goal has eight and now chance at nine well it gives you some idea of the strength and balance of Justin mutts he cant convert but the Hokies have had success down on the low post lets see if they keep going back to that just the third field goal of the last 12 for Virginia Tech free throw keeps it a fourpoint play after the miss the silly theres a double team with Collins a league Bay in traffic too strong thats really good defense and Padula he sprinted in front of one of the BC players outside almost had a steal threepointer off for Padula Hokies are two of ten from three West remember we showed you in the first half of that first game they were one for ten and a whistle off the ball and Justin mutts I think its on Justin Motz and a quick look at Earl Grants home and Road woes and I and look Im being kind here theyre one and six on the road one and five and ACC Road games Dan the differential at the bottom 10 points nearly in scoring thats one field goal percentage I mean field goal to temps rather just a skosh different if you will but its its real the struggle how the road has reacted to this BC team leaping catch bicker staff eight to shoot back door heres Matson What A Catch of that try to get it back to Bickerstaff Matson saves it to him hes got to put it up and instead its a shot clock violation on the Eagles thats a tough break for Boston College because Bickerstaff is not one of their better offensive guys and so you would prefer that he not have the ball at the end of the shot clock but really good defense by the Hokie yeah The Possession kind of pivoted on the double team and the quick pass out of it and the Eagles didnt have any answer for the coverage Virginia Tech had heres basily now its a fourpoint game and the Hokies have hit just two threes in their first 10 shots from behind that line and Couture trying to reset that cannot Matson tried to box out Vasily couldnt control the rebound but kept it alive well Wesson another problem for the Hokies Padula hadnt scored two heres post Skips from Matson three ball good Mason Madson hes got five West that was some pass out of the double team by post 13 bench points for Boston College whos hit five of ten threes in the first half Padula on the drive rebounded inside here are the Eagles leading by seven Ashton Langford through traffic post a long three whoa my goodness time out for Mike Young my goodness Boston cops out of the double team by post then another great pass out of a double team by post and then post caps It Off by making a deep deep three West they already have six threes in the game and you mentioned before they only average five they had 11 in 35 tries on Saturday night against Syracuse now some may say the conversion to a temporary show is a little skewed but boy they have sent a message here in the first what 15 minutes of play in Virginia Tech got a wellneeded bucket from basily on a great pass from Collins well thats a really nice set play and again thats where the Hokies have had some success heres Ashton Langford he is scoreless in this first half how about that theyre ahead by eight and Langford hadnt scored and another catch and score by Quentin post hes got 13 now in this first half if Ashton Lankford is going to make a pass like that West it cannot be defended he caught that he kept the ball high and just laid it in the basket he seems to he seems to have a really solid fundamental game three ball Padula and post out battles basily for the rebound well and you have you have to take that shot if youre Padula that was good ball movement you get a wide open three youll take that from Padula every time Padulas missed all four of his field goal tries meanwhile post knocks down his third three of the half hes got 16 in this first half the lead its largest to this opening frame 3724 for the Eagles well Boston College has been shooting the three better percentagewise and theres just a careless turnover but if youre youre scouting Boston College you think okay we can get them make them shoot threes but post just catches that ball West bounces right back up and now here again he doesnt have much room but thats enough room to make that three Boston College comes in shooting 30 percent from Beyond The Arc and ACC play so you figure if youre going to give something up give up the three well not tonight Madsen now Lynn Kidd into defend post Ashton Langford nice Cut there goes bicker staff he had it blocked no whistle for the foul Padula trying to create the transition chance thats a good play by mats he went straight up Lynn Kidd with post now back for Padula nope and the rebound for Ashton Langford Sean Padula a little frustrated well Weston thats one thing that the Hokies cant do when the balls not going in the basket you dont want to let it affect the rest of your game and their defense has been a little off kilter since they started missing shots heres Bickerstaff now Kellys 23 seem to kind of get the Eagles ignited here from behind the line Ashton Lankford pushes one up thats their first Miss and their last six tries from behind the line so the lead stays at 13 inside two minutes to go first half all right Ashton langfords actually one of their better threepoint Shooters almost 35 percent in conference play butts waiting on something hell flip it foul line kid nope and Bickerstaff pulls away the rebound that shot was really flat kid is much better around the basket I think thats a win for BC if you get him shooting jump shots Ashton Langford kind of bobbing and weaving with The Rock on the drive look at this skip out and Kelly rimmed out on the three Bickerstaff tried to keep it alive He will draw the Virginia Tech foul well even though he missed the shot Kelly has gone over and telling Ashton Langford what a great pass that was yep I mean there was nobody within eight feet of Kelly yep I actually like it theres all five Hokies you can see them in the picture and the white shirt finally comes out to Kelly he misses it but with everybody trying to react to that pass West nobody blocks out bickerstack yep TJ Bickerstaff by the way 71 percent Boston College is 784 against the ACC and that missed badly so with 110 to go its a 13point lead for the Eagles and back to the Zone goes Boston College boy must is asking for the ball tried to go inside the kid blacked by post and then Quentin post has kicked picked up his second foul trying to challenge Justin mutts on the drive the second on post is six now on BC well that was a real break for the Hokies because mutts tried to throw that ball through post and it hit him in the hands and bounced right back to mucks here is Justin mutts for a pair of free throws he is number one in the ACC in conference play in field goal percentage entering tonight at 576 he has had some terrific games and the first free throw bounds away and I gotta tell you the 24 year old youngster here from Millville New Jersey well I cant say youngster 24 well thats younger than you well for me Fair Point um he has maximized the college experience you know about high point in Delaware and obviously Virginia Tech I mean hes got a bucket of degrees Dan yes to go with it and good for him he is a pleasure to talk to and hes a terrific basketball player three ball Pena front rim Miss Couture the rebound and Collins took a shot up around that nose where that mask is trying to protect but even when you get inadvertently contacted it could be trouble heres kid inside hell catching Duncan home Lynn kids been pretty good as of late 79 percent from the floor in the last eight games coming into tonight its a 10point game and BC will take the final shot here well they will but those couple last couple of baskets I think were big for Virginia Tech got the crowd back in this one Ashton Lankford nice pass inside bicker staff follows it twice and he will have seven to finish the half and Earl Grants team is going to take a 12 point lead to the locker room Dan well Wes we talked about how in that early game Boston College applied great defensive pressure and just wore Virginia Tech out with their Smokies have had most of their success theyve got 16 points in the lane Watson basily have been effective down there because the threepoint ball just hasnt been there for Virginia Tech so far tonight if youre Mike young would you talk to your team about at halftime here well I think you know they were talking defensively they have to get the defense straightened out too many easy shots for Boston College and you got to move the ball a little bit better on offense and Couture a hard bounce pass that mutts cant handle so the Hokies commit turnover number four to start the second half and they were trying to do the right thing Wes the ball skipped off mutts his hands but theyre trying to go inside a league Bay starts the second half with McLaughlin heres Kelly hes in for the injured Jaden Zachary and Chaz Kelly tosses in a three wow yep wow I guess you said Jaden Zachary one of the best players for BC is out with that leg injury well and Kellys just matched his conference average hes got three threes for nine points Zachary averaged almost 10 there is basily knocking down his first three of the night hes got 11 still a 12 point game McLaughlin had it taken away by mutts strong play by the veteran hokey player Applause Couture theres a mismatch inside yep there it is basily rolling on Ashton Lankford and He will draw a Clarence Armstrong whistle thats before the shot yeah but its on Makai Ashton Lankford now he grabbed him pretty good down there but when youre Makai asked in Langford and youre battling against the seven foot guy and youre six foot three thats what you have to do hes the grad transfer from Providence from Worcester his younger brother Demar not with the team trying to get through a knee injury here is mutts Wheeling into the lane and he threw another one too hot for Couture to handle and decides that it tapped it was deflected by an eagle on the way out of bounds so it will stay with the Hokies with 11 to shoot I think mutts has to take that one up against post post has to be a little careful heres mutts a reroute for Couture on the pass Hunter dropped it Justin finally on the second try gets the double figures now with 11 thats a good job by Couture to take the ball into the lane dont settle for that threepoint shot four straight double field games for mutts pokies to a 10point spot Ashton Lankford spot up jumper rattles in first points of the night for Makai Ashton Lankford heres Petula and the Hokies right back at BC illi on the drive theyre definitely trying to get post to Third and Grand facilities got five of Virginia Tech seven here in the second half well West particularly early post has to be careful Applause Ashton Langford a long three hes got five in a row for Earl Grants team Wesson the problem for Virginia Tech is they cant string together stops and were gonna get a whistle and a foul off the ball and its all Ashton Langford he and Couture jocking second on the Eagles and the second on Ashton Lankford whos litigating with uh Clarence Armstrong Padula for Collins and the kayash in Langford is really all over 100 Couture and theres a three from Padula just nothing doing for Padula tonight nope so far its been a tough night at the yard as they say medullas 0 for six overall oh for four from Beyond the up theres a steal by the silly Ashton Lankford went for the pick and basily went big man fast break seven of Virginia Techs nine to Grant basili Applause hes trying to bring him back by himself doing a pretty good job at the moment Applause Ashton Lankford right back McLaughlin easy dunk seven for Devin McLaughlin Wes theres that screen again that has really hurt Virginia Tech in both of their last two matchups Langford just made a couple of baskets and so you have two guys go with him and nobody covers McLaughlin Ashton Lankford almost stole it up here in front of Arlo Courtside location but it went out of bounds off Makai so itll stay with the Hokies mutts and now here is Collins boy the young freshmans been quiet tonight hadnt he three ball Couture six for Couture he had an early triple to start the game and now one here about three minutes in change into half two Hokies are now five of seven from the floor here in the second half BC lead to 10 again Applause heres post he thought he got fouled didnt chase it seven to shoot Ashton Lankford trying to take basily down a league Bay routing around Collins hell fire with the clock winding down as an air ball and heres Virginia Tech much strong into traffic back for Couture West and the other thing that youre seeing here is on those three point shots the Hokies go falling back to prevent transition so Virginia Tech has done very little on the offensive boards tonight its been one and done McLaughlin with post Quick Pass inside heres McLaughlin working around hell score against Justin mutts boy Devin McLaughlin now with nine and McLaughlin had a big game The Last Time Wesley had 18 yeah Boston College has won the last four games in the series Mike Youngs beating everybody in this league seemingly except these guys since becoming the Hokey head coach down low basily backing in on McLaughlin nice turn with a left hand everything but putting it in the basket Wes Dan in some ways it feels like BCs been able to control the tempo of the game no question Wes Kelly heres McLaughlin sliding through strong take and a block on basily so a free throw coming for Devin McLaughlin 5130 not to court is for Boston College theyve got Five Guys basically beyond the threepointer theres no help for the Virginia Tech defense and look at this theres nobody beneath the freethrow line except for DC guys so its one on one and McLaughlin who had 18 points the last time West is having another really strong game and a free throw coming for the Eagles on the foul against basily for the block that we showed you in the final sequence there West Boston College is doing a great job spreading Virginia Tech out moving the ball and then attacking after theyve moved the defense and and Boston College theyre scoring a lot of points today but this is not a team that plays an uptempo style and so Virginia Tech isnt really a run up and down team either and I think the tempo that Virginia Tech likes to play suits Boston College BC averages 67 points in League Play Thats 13th they are at 54 and were about six minutes into the second half Couture a little skip and a drive and then had it blocked again Boston College doing a great job defensively and now nobodys guarding Kelly and he misses on the three Camden tried to run it down and it was deflected and last touch McLaughlin who was stepping out of bounds said Keith Kimball so it will belong to Virginia Tech here Manson right at the moment what were starting to see from the Hokies is theyre starting to look at the referees every time and you just this you know if Boston College is being physical you just have to adapt to that and this is a very physical tough BC team out of the corner Padula On Target Sean Padula first bucket of the night of any kind for the sophomore from medman Oklahoma West theres still plenty of time left in the game for the Hokies but they have to start getting some stops on a consistent basis post took his eye off the pass tried to go back and recover it and then diving for the loose ball commits his third foul seven minutes into the second half post gives it back to the Hokies quick reminder for you tomorrow night 10 oclock Eastern after our womens basketball doubleheader nothing but net Kelsey Riggs Lexi Brown Kelly grahamlink in the Hall of Famer Muffet McGraw break down the night in womens basketball and preview of busy weekend analysis and more right here on acc network streaming live on the ESPN app Wesson interestingly enough turnovers have simply not been much of a factor in this game thats only the fifth turnover by Boston College post comes out of the ball game Bickerstaff and Matson have come back in for the first time here in the second half but certainly big contributors in the opening 20 minutes for Earl Grants team who still leads by 12 here is basily on the drive and picker staff reaches in thatll be the first of Bickerstaff the fourth on BC and basily going to work his way to free throws out of this wow he was I think he was taking it up West but Im telling you what if youre going to drive into the lane against this Boston College team you better be prepared and basily was he did a great job hanging on to that one silly first missed at the line in three tries tonight hes had 20 or more in just three games against the ACC you see from Milwaukee Wisconsin terrific player at Wright State started 56 of his 95 games there boy those are big misses right there sure are two shot chance goes by the board Kelly on the drive and he will get free throws and the foul is on Padula his second on Virginia Tech well here again Padula comes off the screen and just cant catch up Kellys quickness you know Pat and Padula didnt get picked off by the screen West but he had to try to avoid it and that got him behind the eight ball with Keller free throw rims out for Kelly now remember Aaron Blacksburg Dan bacon on the table nope Kelly broke their hearts now in the second half guy with two free throws misses them both they get bacon 10 for Chaz Kelly Music it is his first double figure game in the ACC in his second of the year facilia three and a foul on bicker staff and three free throws coming for basily on the fifth team foul against Boston College so really nice job by Couture he comes off the screen cant get stopped in time but finds basili open and West you have to give a guy the opportunity to come down Virginia Tech five out of nine tonight and basilys third free throw he has eight in the half 16 in the game this Boston College defense is making Couture and Padula work so hard to just get the ball its hard for those guys to get set for their shot and trying to cut it to 10 here is basily well Wes you know it gets down to 10 again and Virginia Tech has actually played pretty well offensively in the second half but you know the closest theyve been able to get his team Pena has reported back for Boston College and now basilis out mutts comes in with kid John Camden Couture and Padula BCs got Kelly Makai Ashton Langford Devin McLaughlin Mason Madsen and CJ Pena the welltraveled CJ Pena might add heres Ashton Langford Madsen back door cut look at McLaughlin and kid slapped it off the glass great play by Lynn Kidd on what looked like an easy basket look at mutts 13 for mutts Hokies to within single digits for the first time in a while foreign Applause by Kelly wow Wes the Eagles have had an answer every time the Hokies have made a run at him yep huge play by Kelly hes got four threes in the ball game kick out and a triple no from Camden 13 tonight for Kelly say hes got four threes West that is twice as many as he has had in 10 previous ACC games and the ball thrown away on the entry pass by McLaughlin heres Padula leading the break all the way to the glass and were gonna get a foul and its on Madsen thatll get us to a timeout hokey free throws when we come back to Blacksburg BC by 11 wow Wes this is the guy who came in shoot two for 16 from Beyond The Arc and ACC play but hes four for six tonight and Boston College has really built this lead offensively on the strength of their threes theyve made ten threes as a team West and five different guys have made one yep you get a look at Kellys numbers 25 bench points tonight that hes a big part of and BCs got double figure threes in backtoback games for the first time since December of 2019 boy thats an amazing number and Wes keep in mind that Kelly is getting all these minutes tonight because of the unfortunate injury to Jaden Zachary right it was interesting though to talk to Earl Grant today about holding Quentin post and that being a silver lining for like you know a league Bay and Pena and guys like that maybe Chaz Kelly also benefits a little bit from having played in big games like he played a lot of Duke he played you know in the mte they played he played a big night at Nebraska on the road right I mean somewhere in there the payoff may be happening and maybe tonight its in Blacksburg well Wes uh Earl Grant told us that the way Kellys developing he may be their best point guard right now yeah nothing that hes done tonight would uh refute that nope 10point game again Padula hit both free throws here is post remember with the three fouls hell turn on kid draw Lynn kids foul you know Dan Quentin post hes talented but hes also pretty smart too well theres no question but look here theres the side is completely cleared for him Hunter Couture drops down there very shortly but weve seen in this game what happens when they double team him he does a great job passing out of the double team 16 for posts make it 17 so he hits his second free throw missed his first threes now hit two in a row but silly is back and the second one good first points in the second half 18 now in the ball game for post 12 point game again and Ashton Langford and Kelly have just done a tremendous job pressure on the ball in the hands of either Padula or Couture the silly against Pena and CJ Pena gets called for his first and its seven now on Boston College with 10 22 to go and thats where Boston College defense has had a little bit of a problem tonight trying to defend particularly basily driving into the lane the league Bay comes in Pena is out the first of the one in one falls off the rim for basilic were needing every single point you can get Wes you missing the front end of a oneonone I mean were down to 10 minutes left in this game yep its 12 points Hokies have not come with the flurry a league Bay through that high and away from post even a seven footer couldnt make the catch of that bullet so thats turned over by Boston College well Wes lots of times the Hokies flurries is built on the back of Couture and Padula making threes and that just hasnt been part of the equation tonight eighth turnover for BC under 10 to go Virginia techs won three of their last four the only loss in there is a hardfought ball game at Miami last week and theres a turnover by Virginia Tech thats their fifth of the night time again Langford did a great job preventing Hunter Couture for having anything open like a look at it through post thought about the three basily handles the now theyll rescreen it heres post out front against mutts thought about it seven to shoot oh look he faked the pass then months went for the foul originally the second all months and the fourth on Virginia Tech so Wes hes not just smart hes clever you know he fakes the pass calls for the screen and then just drives to the basket much two fouls he got me the first time and threw me another one fourth on Virginia Tech heres Matson jump stops in traffic and then almost turned it over got it back wrestling for it now heres a league back good heavens when mutts got hit in the arm Kelly trying to set up a screen a league Bay up three is good Prince a league matches 9th three of the year its his first point of the night and theyre handing out coupons on the BC bench for him now 11 of 20 tonight or the Eagles from behind the line and basily missed the layup got it back and scored thats good battle by basili West but its hard to come back in the game when youre scoring two and the other guys are scoring three hes got 20 for the fourth time in ACC play 6350 Boston College with eight and a half and Counting entry for post left hand scores against basilla again theres no help coming 20 for post Dan for the fourth time in the last five games Wesson he got about as close as you can get in terms of securing position down on the inside heres Padula kick out for basili and Matson goes High to pull it away well Wes when basily shooting it from out there theres only one person into rebound Ashton Lankford back rim post the rebound stolen from behind nice play Hunter Couture seven and a half to go westner down 15 its time to get rolling basily starts the train with the threes Hokies have hit six threes in 21 tries but they Trail a dozen timeout in Blacksburg seven and a half to go Prince the league Bay wants one and then you know what back inside the Quentin post whos got another 20point night the footage and threepoint field goal percentage I love it 23 threes weve made three tonight Music hes unbelievable he is and we talked about Jordan Miller in Miami on Saturday this is another undervalued guy in the ACC people dont talk about well with that question Wes and one of the reasons theyve made so many threes is his ability to pass the ball absolutely so and you know he made three threes early and then they started double teaming and then he started passing the ball out so theyve stopped double teaming so now hes scoring under the basket drop the screen kick in the corner a league Bay of three wow 64 Prince a league Bay on paratripples here in half two and the lead is right back to 15 well some teams just match up really well with other teams and you and you get the idea that Boston College just matches up really well with the Hokies foul on Ashton Lankford free throws for Couture when we come back to by the way everybody either has six or seven left to go Couture to the line first of two after the foul on Aston Langford got us to the timeout first free throws of the night for the Orlando senior Hunter now was seven and the second one also drops in so hes got eight padulo put a little backcourt pressure on Ashton Lankford and now heres PC again feels like they might try and change the tempo of it a little bit Virginia Tech wants to speed up Eagles try and drop it down into gearbox a little bit I dont know if I was BC Id drop it down in the gearbox they have been so successful tonight just keep rolling what a pass Ashton Lankford post had it blocked out of bounds with 18 on the shot clock and Earl Grant wanted to foul in front of AJ Desai didnt get it five blocks tonight for the Hokies just one for BC Music 18 left on the clock lob post catch score Bonner ran that one back in Western PA wow 22 for Quentin post 7055 catch and shoot sure tell you what facility now has had three threes in the second half and he is now got 26 in the ball game Ashton Lankford again against some pressure from Padula into the corner of League Bay tees up another one mutts the rebound we go inside of six minutes to play West theres still plenty of time heres Padula skip from mutts left corner Couture and post collects Wes theres plenty of time but when you get shots like that youve got to make him youre in a situation where youve got to make up a pretty big deficit Applause Matson now McLaughlin here again the ball screen stuff a league Bay thought about it into traffic against kid shoots over the big man and missed everything out of bounds now Earl Grant thought that was deflected but with 519 to go itll belong to Virginia Tech down 12 well and again they didnt score that time Boston College but it was after a Virginia Tech Team didnt score so if youre going to trade the baskets that helps you and if you trade stops that helps you yep whatever you can do to keep Virginia Tech from cutting into that lead 12point game here is Kid Padula sets Off the Mark Quentin post and heres Ashton Lankford trying to create an advantage and that was really good defense by Kelly that was a tough shot by Padula both had it knocked away mutts fighting for it back for Kelly Matson trying to get Baseline kids shut that down I dont think he was throwing it to the post trying to get to Ashton Lankford with seven to shoot the league Bay is shot fake all the way to the basket up off the rim and couldnt finish all right now Virginia Tech needs a basket West four and a half to play Padula spinning a whirling dervish and Kelly blocked it out of bounds Wes we had a situation early in the half for Virginia Tech where they were scoring consistently because but they couldnt cut into the lead because they couldnt get any stops now theyre getting stops but they cant score yeah and here comes Devin McLaughlin back for Boston College he will replace Mason Matson well theyre a little bit bigger because Virginia Tech is a little bit bigger kid mutts and basily in the game at the same time boy Ashton Langford caught an inadvert and elbow theres a three and pulled away by McLaughlin and basily going to commit the foul itll be his third that is five on the Hokies boy Ashton Lankford took one right across the face and what did he do Wes he popped right back up yep you know hes rubbing his chin but he popped right back up you know he sort of ran into that one it wasnt really a swinging elbow but he popped right back up and theres Couture with a wide open shot Kelly working out thats really a nice job by Kelly not to be flustered Ashton Langford a pullup jumper spins off look at the tap twice by post and a timeout is taken Quentin post has now got 24 in the ball game lead is 14 and the big man from Amsterdam is trying to take the Eagles to their second Road win of the year in the ACC they won at Notre Dame back in January lesson keep in mind that the Eagles beat the Hokies the last time without Post Yeah and this time theyre winning the game even though Jaden Zachary got hurt and had to leave but of course because Zachary had to leave Chaz Kelly came in and Kelly has 13 points and has done an outstanding defensive job against Sean Padula hes got a career high does Kelly The Freshman from Houston yeah Makai Ashton Langford and Kelly I think have been outstanding defensively against Padula and Couture but silly lost it on the dribble forced it up spins off and the rebound is pulled away by a league Bay and West that is you know if you look it up in the dictionary that might be the definition of a tough shot right there well if it finishes at its current rate Virginia Tech well see Boston College shoot 50 or better from the floor for just the fourth time this year Dan Ube and if it finishes this way itll be the fifth straight loss for the Hokies against Boston College how weird is that it is Ashton Langford a three from the Moon and that missed everything well dont forget a doubleheader of womens basketball for you tomorrow night on acc Network well get you started with number 10 Notre Dame welcoming Pittsburgh to Purcell Pavilion then off to WinstonSalem for NC States visit eight oclock tip time and Winston Thursday night ACC womens basketball presented by allies on accn and streaming on the app so you can watch it anywhere Wes we talked earlier about the fact when BC missed a bunch of Threes that that really wasnt the strength of BCs game Padula knocks down a three but boy it has been a strength of BCs game Wes and and what did they miss their first six threepoint shots or something like that yep and you think okay the strategy to let them shoot the three might be pretty good but then they started knocking them down and when Virginia Tech pushed out to defend the street they started throwing it inside it has been a very impressive offensive performance by Boston College but again Ill say I think their defense has been even more impressive particularly the defense against Padula and kadur Eagles Eagles started two of seven from three which makes him six of their last 19 if you figure out that they are eight of 26 tonight and there is Kelly a layup and they broke the pressure easily what a night for Chaz Kelly the third out of Cy Creek High School in Houston and the Phelps School in Pennsylvania he has played really well tonight for Earl Grant and post gathers another rebound and here is a league Bay into the front court with 210 to play and the lead heres 13 again well now you can afford to take your time Wes Music ulla trying to stay in front of Ashton Lankford with eight to shoot Makai for Kelly theres a three and post took the rebound away from behind Collins hes now got a double double tonight as Quentin post and he just throws it back outside and they hold it to take another 20 second in the ACC had one in their Road win at Notre Dame and with 98 seconds left here is mutts whoa wow he didnt make the dunk but he gets high marks on the attempt by heavens fourth on post nice on Boston College he took off from the sea of the ACC and he had way up in the air you know in ACC history one night at University Hall in a nontelevised game Gene Banks dunked the ball between the head and right shoulder of Ralph Sampson and Im not saying that was in the ballpark but it had been on the list right well Wes it would have been but what its like is a long drive foul in baseball its just a loud and he only gets one point out of it no question but my Heavens but it was impressive I agree with him post will take a timeout quick double team by the Hokies it is a 12 point lead for BC trying to get this one to the house tonight at Castle cup well you see the story 94 seconds left to go Boston College leads Virginia Tech by 12 here in Blacksburg tonight and Dan its since a kind of a wobbly start by Earl Grants team they have been the better team tonight without any question Wes and that wobbly start didnt bother him they just kept playing and thats what weve seen from Boston College West they are gritty bunch of guys and they just keep coming at you so backcourt pressure now applied by the Hokies you see muscle defend the inbounds pass of a league Bay and there is Matson on the catch and hell slide into the front Court theres a double team and what do we have a foul called I believe on Hunter Couture itll be his sixth our 16th foul against Virginia Tech Boston College has got 27 bench points tonight and Chaz Kellys got a career high off that bench a league Bay he started he threw in a couple threes here in the second half Matson tried to get it to post it got deflected and out of bounds and Earl Grant theres a look hes got NC State at Conti Forum on Saturday at Pitt at Florida State at wake to finish the drill goodness heavens theres a skip pass What A Catch by post came down with It reversed it back up and it fell off the rim 77 seconds left hokeys got to get busy mutts on the drive wouldnt go rebounded basily 10th field goal of the night for Grant facili hes got 28 his season high was against Delaware State early in the year when he hit 30 his career had 37 against Marshall when he was at Wright State well West even in that situation it was a fast break situation Boston College got back on defense and Virginia Tech had to work very hard to get that basket and I think that some pretty much sums up the BC defense after that early quick start by the Hokies BC has made them work very hard for everything yep well Mike Youngs team who beat Virginia here on Saturday and now all of a sudden this tonight is going to have them a little reeling but Dan the the final Loop here nothing easy about any of these next five for sure Georgia Tech by the way leading Notre Dame tonight in Atlanta and now theyre tied in the final half minute it became his Pavilion but you see Miami my Heavens the canes Monday night Dan what a show that was huh not Miami is playing as well as anybody right at the moment you know the hurricane said some problems finishing games on the road earlier but they seem to have overcome those woes yep so its a 10point game with 70 seconds left Music and Kelly will go to the inline to put it in play against Lynn Kim AJ Desai telling both schools you can run the inline here and heres Ashton Lankford and a quick foul by Kid I believe and thatll send Ashton Langford to the line and as we are apt to say on the seventh against the Hokies from here on well see some free throws we wont see as many free throws as we saw last night Winston oh good Heavens but we will see some free throws and if you dont know about Wake Forest in the win against North Carolina Tyree Appleby of the Deacons set an ACC record last night for free throw attempts and freethrow makes and when I tell you the names of the people he broke in terms of free throws attempted record that was held by Ronnie shablick of NC State from 1955 and Dicky Hamrick of Wake Forest also in 1955 he had 23 makes which broke Grady Wallace of South Carolina and York lauricia of North Carolinas records Grady Wallace played did South Carolina 1957 but silly knocks down a three and grabs his elbow it is a nine point game under a minute to go inbounds Ashton Langford lost it heres basily and the layup good 33 for basily on his 12th field goal and Ashton Langford fouled by Padula eighth foul on Virginia Tech so one and one down here to our right and basily was grabbing his right elbow Dan after the three and hes still hes still massaging that elbow yeah well but if he can make a three it cant be but so bad right thats kind of what I was thinking so here is Ashton Langford Makaya one and one two for two at the line tonight free throw good well Wes whats your in the situation right now and I dont think you have enough time to do it youre trying to trade you give them the oneonone so they get two you have to come down and get three thats the only way this works Applause and it will be a nine point game 7869 heres Devin McLaughlin in for Ashton length on the drive Padula layup rolls in and that doesnt really hurt you if youre Boston College you need to defend the three McLaughlin the layup in transition nine and a half 14 in the game for Devin McLaughlin Padula pull up three sure 38 seconds on a clock and last Touch by Virginia Tech on the inbounds well its a sixpoint game 37 seconds left timeout BC and Virginia Tech is asking the review here of the inbounds pass so hold the phone here now Earl Grant is taking the time out if theyre going to review it they may not give him the timeout unless he wants it in other words if theyre going to review he might just go ahead and talk to his team because you dont have to take the time out to get the officials to review in the last two minutes the officials review those contested well they can review any out of bounds points right used to be it had to be a contested one but now you can look to see if there was only one guy and he had his foot on the line or something but the question is who touches this last on the floor its awarded to Boston College theres Kelly he had it and looks like well it looks like Padula knocked it out of his hand yeah how about uh oh yeah pedula slashed down at the ball and I think he was hoping to drive the ball down so it would go off the leg but that looked to me like it just went straight out of bounds tell you what the folks here at uh Virginia Tech providing a couple of nice overhead looks one from the basket support and then one from but the officiating Crews not often given access to and you see well there you go you get the overhead look to look at the officials yeah we got an overhead look to look at officials looking at the overhead full service for you tonight on the network and AJ decides talking to Keith Kimball while Clarence Armstrong looks again Dan and Wes the important point that you made was that the officials awarded it to Boston College so they have to find something definitive they have to find something indisputable there thats it indisputable video evidence so 37 seconds left in the sixpoint game and I think what the officials are looking at now is theyre trying to determine the time thats it thats why you see Clarence Armstrong trying to expand the screen and look at the shot clock yep Boston College by the way Dan weve talked about all these things tonight 24 assists on 29 field goals tonight Wes this is a team thats not noted as a really efficient offensive team but they have been very efficient tonight Earl Grant wants him to decide that theres three seconds left in the game thats exactly right yeah and shot clock is at 29 Wes remember the clock doesnt stop until the balls out of bounds right and the balls not out of bounds until it touches something out of bounds and in this case it touched the floor okay so Lynn Kidd theyre trying to get Lynn Kidd into the game and because the ball was put in play after the mate basket and now their review and not a timeout Dan they cant put the sub in correct well they did put a sub in they put Camden in and what they were trying to do was try to take Camden house and you cant put Camden in and take Camden out until some time runs off the clock thank you so Camden is going to stay in the game Applause boy this is taking a while a lot going on here well now Camdens coming in the game okay well Im I have no idea you know I thought kid was in the game wasnt he heres Kelly to put it in play and does to post and theres a quick foul with 365 left so only 14 came off the clock and Quentin post is going to go back to the line well Georgia Tech beat Notre Dame tonight in Atlanta 7068 remember the first meeting went to overtime in the game tonight in Atlanta Wes thats what was going on there was just some confusion at the scores table kid was in the game right and they tried to put Camden in and then it got all confused over there so kid was in the game so he could stay in the game they wanted to put Camden in thats what the officials ruled they couldnt do oh post had it rattle out sixpoint game 33 seconds left the silly missed it a league Bay had it lost it they battled for it Ashton Langford couldnt handle it with 269 left it stays with Virginia Tech well you know if you get basilian open three thats what you want yep and thats why they were trying to put Camden in the game because hes a threepoint shooter and kid isnt thats it inbounds Couture back for Padula steps into one air ball and mutts touched it last itll belong to and theyre going to reach to college so Keith Kimball called it off Virginia Tech awarded it to BC and then spends his finger to indicate the review well again Wes in the last two minutes of a game the officials have the option of doing that you almost never see them refuse to review that play by the way the Georgia Tech noter game game decided on a lance Terry followup of a Kyle Sturdivant missed jump shot wow thank you thats a tough contested three oh well the question is did it touch mutts on the way out because it looks like this that hits Post in the shoulder and did it ever touch much so you see the boy youre getting a really good look at the monitor tonight and the array of angles thats a good thing they they have but I wouldnt be able to handle all those little boxes but now watch the ball is going to hit Post in the shoulder hit him in the right shoulder and bounce off and the question is did it ever hit mucks did it hit mutts in the face did it hit mutts in his shoulder I dont think mutts got a hand on it the heart I dont know that the ball hit mutts but I dont know that theres enough there to change the call thats a good point too they just did okay Well the hat well theres a good look at it West you can see the ball bounce off a post and it never does touch much it misses his face it mitches his shoulder right Earl Grant knows the game is on now Dan with 214 left well again you only have to defend tested threes Boston College so they put time on the clock 218 yep which means now the shot clock is in play again because its 20 seconds Padula lobbing for mutts ghost is there hes playing with four fouls butts Charles posts fifth foul and thatll be five on Quentin post terrific night he fouls out with 24 points 10 rebounds his second DoubleDouble of the year against the ACC well Wes he really contests this hard and what he does a good job of is he makes sure on the foul that mutts cant get it up to the basket and get the oldfashioned threepoint play so youd rather he not foul but if hes going to foul Force the guy to go to the free throw line second time post is fouled out of a game this year and it happens with 186 left and mutts is going to go the line where he is four for seven Syracuse a winner tonight in Tallahassee 7667 you know Syracuse is an odd team they got 26 tonight from Joe Gerard 16 from judaments and 18 and 12 from Jesse Edwards well theyre not an odd team when they do that theyre pretty good cheers butts at the line first one is good fairly dramatic as it bounces around and drops in well Wes even if he makes this its still a fourpoint game yep and so now Camden comes out and kid comes back in you gotta foul immediately if you dont get a steal 2110 run for Virginia Tech to cut it to four right back to Kelly Jazz Kelly fouled by Padula in the backcourt his fourth or five rather that is five on Padula so Sean Padula is going to foul out with 146 left and Wes this is just an outstanding pass by the league Man league Bay shoots under 70 percent from the freethrow line in conference play but he gets rid of the ball immediately and then Padula hes got those four fouls so he doesnt want to commit the fifth foul double bonus here by the way for Boston College so two free throws coming for Kelly so that really hurts Virginia Tech on a couple of levels and one Padula hasnt been tonight but hes one of your best threepoint Shooters and the three is the only thing thats going to bail you out now if you can get enough of them yep and Im just not sure you have enough time so here is Kelly to shoot two freshman from Houston has had a career night and that pushes it to a fourpoint game fivepoint game Dan so two possessions with 146 left Wes hes two for three from the line tonight coming in and Conference play he was oh for one so he hadnt been there that often because he hadnt played that much well dont act like the rest of the regular season wasnt a bad bar either was two for four on the year right were playing with a ton of confidence tonight wow it bounds with 14 seconds left pokeys got to get it and go thats a nice job to put pressure basily a long three kid missed the kid got the rebound back to basily and that will Bound Away and so will the Hokies hopes tonight as Boston College has come to Blacksburg and upset Virginia Tech 8276 Dan its extremely impressive performance
