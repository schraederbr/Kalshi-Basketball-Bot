set with a couple of tall guys in the middle a sevenfooter and 611 locking for Clemson Fon Reed former lsar moved a few places he anchors the middle for Wake Forest they are in the road black and the white the home team Clemson Tigers locking off a poor shooting performance but try to get him established early and they do by getting it down low to Applause him in and out first shot from Clemson though comes from their high low action not surpris at all a big concern when you play this team in white Salis and Crosby in the back court thats Cameron ilth he also can shoot from the outside its not a great shooting team theyre averaging just 68 points a game this is the guy Jimmy talked about Salis tough shot he can go get his own one of the better oneonone offensive players in the ACC there is the lineup for Clemson Hunter Zachary playing with a bruised up hand its not his shooting hand sheflin Wiggins and lockin Zachary going to cut good hand Salis hes the first one of the four and thats why Wake Forest got the ball good hustle Hunter Salis yeah some guys go to the four because they play hard other guys go to the Flor because they are competitive dudes really well done by Hunter Salis backto back overtime losses for Clemson Salis looking to drive again another difficult shot off the window Hunter sales four Clemson nothing such a tough tough cover is he not very gifted offensively 23 in Black hes all of 64 I already said 185 but still good job of playing through contact for a small kid jaffin D throws it up he cant get it to go very good defense spot Eon Reed at 7t we know this about Shufflin he struggles to score over height stay between him and the basket youve done a good job yeah Hill Griff he tried to push off and he lost the Applause ball Tosi wiggin steps into a three no Wiggins only seven points against Memphis no points against South Carolina and when hes on offensively Clemson is at their best and he has struggled the last two games Reed has it he quickly gets double team now he has a height advantage against shefflin Spillers wide open no good and they will keep it there its going to be the foul on Chase Hunter as he was clearing out space against dein Crosby well you know this about Clemson youre going to be in a physical battle on both ends of the floor Clemson plays a physical style of ball offensively defensively and when the balls on the glass Alis has four hes coming off a game against James Madison in which he had 27 points 12 rebounds and five assists 272 and five talk about giving some one the business right in the paint fade away and a little short with Zachary defending and theres a foul underneath and Reed may have jammed a finger too H Salis is being checked by one of the better defenders in the AC in Jaden Zach Ian sheon is a dominant rebounder and a below the rim rebounder took a shot to the head on that one did he get poked in the eye and did the poke in the eye if thats what it was end up hurting the fingers of Fon Reed take a look right there Reed grabs no doubt hand and shefflin goes down and is still down at his left eye down to the floor Ian Shufflin hes a 68 senior out of Atlanta and is as Jimmy said the the Valentine the heartbeat of this team look at sheflin right there just takes a shot they went and looked at just a common foul and you always look at it when theres contact above that neck area I think about this from Ian shein ravy hes had at least 13 rebounds six out of the last seven and its a dominant dominant Force only jichael Stillwell from Milwaukee is averaging more rebounds per game thats like like 1 yeah 121 to 120 way to get that note in early Jimmy good job and now Im done for the day with the good notes check that box second leading rebounder in the country and as shefflin gets his left eye looked at you think about Clemson and their football game coming up with Texas later today they were sort of joking about maybe shefflin can be a tight end on the Clemson football team he was a great quarterback and a very good baseball player but he fell in love with basketball in part because well as an indoor activity instead of an outdoor he doesnt like the outdoors little odd good player little cold little odd looking for their first points they send it to Wiggins his Corner three no good locking had it then he lost it something was so good against Kentucky getting back building the wall stopping the ball they the heart of their core under Brad Brownell is sitting a stance and guard the defensive coaches in the game abas is now the guy in with Reed being tended to with that finger issue hes still on the end of the Wake Forest bench and being tended to by the trainer as hes flexing that hand to his comson over for four to start the guy handling the ball right now a very tenacious tough player but boy the assignment on defense is going to be a challenging one as Zachary guard Salis without shuffling in the game that high low action for Clemson is kind of taken away and they go more to four round one and Zachary does a good job of finding the Gap in that four round offense and playing off of two feet he had a terrific game against Kentucky we talked about shefin Zachary was outstanding the Boston College transfer gets Clemson on the board gra you mentioned it Force comes in shooting just over 40 as the team 26 from the threepoint line their offensive struggles are real and you can see it Salis has made a couple of shots and neither of them were easy they havent really had an easy shot yet Zachary a soft touch no good in traffic the rebound Salis a terrific rebounder for a guy who stands 65 you look at the opportunities in this league for Quality wins and wake has one of them right now and Duke Pittsburgh North Carolina its its a short list and you got to take advantage of him Steve fors NOS thats about their fifth Fade Away shot that they have attempted today thats because Clemsons St a good job Ravi just the simple part of the game stay in front of the ball defensively Salis looks at the official pans up confused curious I got bumped you called the travel heres what I like about Hunter sales hes the first fivestar recruit ever out of the state of Nebraska think about that ever the football team is even playing today but certainly theyre playing in two hours 400 eastern time so roughly almost the same time this game ands its quiet in here what are the challenges for the teams in that environment yeah youve got to find your own energy Im actually surprised it probably watch six maybe 7000 people in here theyre going to have a watch party I believe on the scoreboard in here yeah so if you want to youre a Clemson fan want to watch it with other Clemson fans this is the place to be right not a bad idea that was Foster whos in Miles Foster and its four for neither team is shot well and perhaps that speaks to some of the energy nice drive there that counts parter Frederickson out of Oklahoma the sophomore at 64 good job by Frederickson known as a threepoint specialist gets to the drive box of that Clemson defense which isnt easy to get into too strong and a rebound offensively by lockin good pass right good pass exactly and he missed one off the window neither team shooting well Dylan Hunter two in white into the game weve mentioned it but Jaden Zachary 11 in White on Hunter salz one of the better matchups in terms of guard play in this league well they left him wide open Jimmy sure if that was by Design but Frederickson missed an easy one and heres a simple one with the foul from behind by abass a chance for a three Point play for lockin I can tell you it was by Design on the other end cuz Frederickson a 20 threepoint shooter on the year and that Miss threepoint shot and locken does a good job Ravi of getting out in front of the defense appreciate a 611 guy to Sprint rim to rim in the soft set of Paws to haul it in on the Move now good news for WG forest and you see the right hand of Fon Reed taped up on that thumb back into the game and now assumes the position there underneath the basket on the free throw from blockin 75 free throw shooter gets it to go in the first lead of the day for Clemson Ian shein back in So Reed got a thumb in the eye of shefflin both sat out now both back in at the same time in a 76 game simple aint easy and thats how I describe Ian sheins game that the just a simple part of the game the box out the talking pursuing balls with two hands sounds easy but its not and he he excels talking about four in White in those areas now on freericks hell switch off to hildr down low Spillers active throws it up thats too strong and heres shein ripping a rebound good job of forcing Spillers out about a step and a half higher than he wants it Zachary saw a window he had to throw up a running hook shot doesnt go and Salis lost it as it gets a little sloppy on backto back trips theres going to be a foul looks like Frederickson got shuin who was looking in the corner to set up a threepoint shot but he never got it there R I think its very important for Clemson to score within the first eight seconds of the shot clock all season long the reason why I say that they lack guys in a late clock situation they can just break you down and go get your own right they cant get caught in those in those sequences for 40 minutes Jake Hy breeder wears three hes in for Clemson back in the game Chase Hunter whos still looking for his first points of the afternoon kick shefflin too strong and it goes out of bounds thatll be Clemson ball off of Wake Forest talked about Salis and his performance against James Madison Chase Hunter put on a show of his own he had 11 points in 90 seconds at the end of the game in which they eventually lost it overtime but he can absolutely fill it up and do it in a hurry and my and my third good note of the game oh my God just 8 minutes in yeah his mom is only 57 his dads only 59 taught him how to work ones an insurance salesman ones a teacher wow if youre Santa Claus you youve already emptied your bag are out I just I love how he plays and and Forbes Steve Forbes appreciates him as well he was very concerned for as he was before the game just talking about the effort and the motor and the toughness that youre up against when you play Ian sh Hunter will go to the free throw line Reed picks up his second foul big story early two fouls Fon Reed 1249 to go he 430 Eastern Time right here on ESPN our mens basketball mat a triple header it should be the matchup of the day 16th ranked Purdue second ranked Auburn theyre playing that game in Birmingham I spoke with Jay billis today of course Janai broom was banged up they found out he doesnt need surgery not only that the recovery time is less than expected he is expected to start today yeah and play and if something goes sideways theyll take him out but good news for the Auburn Tigers who along with Tennessee have led this incredible start to the season for the SEC its its a monster game Ravi because Purdue could very well win the Big 10 right there with Illinois I think are the best two teams in that league and obviously Auburn Alabama Kentucky Tennessee the number one team in the country theres a bunch of them now the SEC that will be in that race but Purdue plays the game the right way and interesting Bruce Pearl has never beaten Matt painer that is interesting Cameron hildr they changed the foul they gave it to Cameron hildr so only one foul on Fon Reed so I retract the stat of how huge that foul was on Reed at 1249 because it wasnt on him that is a thats a great reason to retract thank you factually incorrect oh Salis the tough shot over Hunter he can make hard shots can he not hes very gifted with that slight fade away to get shots over those long arm Defenders chlin kicks Corner the other Hunter he three2 strong and a good box up by the big Fon Reed I think that finger that hand is bothering Reed he grabbed that rebound had to collect himself for a second before he started to jog back up the floor and an offensive foul called against hildr trying to clear some space now Hunter sales is a is a bucket kter hes being guarded by multiple really good defenders in Hunter and Zachary but when you can score you can score pretty good number to match at 23 Music you back off what is the game what does he want to do he has both of them that they practice on coming in the biggest thing is what are you doing with shefflin because hes the motor that makes that action work Christian Reeves 14 into the game theres 12 on the shot clock Dylan Hunter five on the shot clock hard cut to the left kick past shefflin free ball good he shoots it with courage does he not he shoots it thats for sure he shoots it a lot 30 on the year so you dare him to take dare shots and he will make you pay first threepoint field goal of the day by either team Clemson now one of five Frederickson will try to answer he comes up short and the battle goes to Clemson and good shooters for Wake have just not shot the ball well so far this season shord good reach by Frederickson hes out ahead Hunter joins him tries to draw contact and he will shoot two free throws RAV that was a great not a good job a great job by Frederickson to attack a dribbler with two hands as sheflin turned that thing over Wake Forest gets out and runs and weve always pretty common knowledge in basketball if you struggle to score in the half court you got to score off of your defense but I man I love that two hand attack of the ball by Frederickson to get the steal so Parker Frederickson senior 64 out of Bigby Oklahoma averaging Just Four Points a game Jor said like many on the Wake Forest te trying to find their footing when it comes to shooting especially the three ball you know what Bixby Oklahoma is known for they are a Powerhouse in high school football I believe they have won eight out of the last nine state championships in Oklahoma note number four for those keeping score that is I mean you are uh youre in the you are the chef today youre producing little cookie nuggets for people and I know they are writing them down good hands again Frederickson Salis oh Jimmy may be better off its a weird thing to say but he has made the tough shots and missed the open ones Applause he had no chance to go in it was a line drive shot as Dyan Hunter got the pass from his brother Chase tough match now for high breeder cheze andales cant get it to go down it spins out he will go to the free throw line he will shoot two free throws well Fon Reed offensively you see Hunter salad come off of it and find that little pocket pass with that corner empty and theres no help to rotate in Fon Reed is really good as a sevenfooter on the move with the ball getting fouled very consistent sevenfooter for Steve for 60 free throw shooter knocks down the first football all day and of course it culminates tonight with a huge matchup and what a chance for the SEC to go on the road to the Horseshoe to take on Ohio State Tennessee and Ohio State 800 Eastern Time 5 Pacific on ESPN and ABC and a shout out to the college game day crew know what its like to have to host shows on successive days Etc four hours yesterday this morning in Columbus hats off to all of those guys that have been doing the Yans work and the women behind the scenes as well it has been outstanding to watch just the college football playoff expanded to 12 teams and right now those teams that got in Jimmy that un questioned havent really showed themselves asking you one of them and and what a great atmosphere last night at Notre Dame but today on Game Day V Nation showed up there was more orange at game day than there was yeah the red of Ohio State and thats going to be just another great atmosphere tonight believe its 800 Eastern yeah Salis picked up a foul there in the back court thats only his first but maybe a little bit of frustration for Salis who come on out and take a seat we got attitude back out on the Cameron hildr is back out there apparently Mr attitude at least according to those behind us here whose voice definitely today can be heard unlike other games theyre in that high low set right now and Locks capable of making it thats the issue Im talking about what do you do when they get high low do you back off and gamble a little bit that the big cant make it if you do man lockin just make some pay yeah and lockin has been very hot I against Memphis 23 and 11 and in their most recent loss not very good there is a good drive by hildr he is their second best oneonone player six in Black right there behind Hunter Sol very tough Rugged Drive the ball through trash kill theres a line drive shot for three that falls for hid breeder and all of a sudden theyre warming up Im not sure the ball was ever going to get over the rim to your description about a line drive a foreen fast ball that had some rise to it just stayed on plane Frederickson just trying to get one to drop and he cant and a little oneonone action here the pullup tear drop Falls and all of a sudden Clemsons Catching Fire as Chase Hunter drops it in such an active game Chase Hunter talked about the last time he we were here I believe four games already this year he has put in five miles of running within the 40minute game they wear monitors to tell you how far youre running Reed really deep too deep he goes right up over locking just a big load of a guy right after Reed we sign at LSU before he transferred out of there just very patient strong on that low box screen from Lock and leaves Hunter open he cant get it to go and you look at wake Forces schedule and what theyve done so far this game they have North Carolina and Duke at home Pittsburgh at home and at Duke that thats really thats the meat left on the bone in terms of their schedule in terms of can they make a case for a strong resume impressionable wins those are that Reed working Fade Away uh no side of the back court Zachary trying to get ahead of the field theres the bounce pass and he couldnt control it Hunter fires again look good and it was isnt it something how sometimes you stumble into a shot because had Zachary not fumbled the ball he probably would had a tough layup on the left side instead he fumbles it and has to kick it for a Reload three you sure that wasnt on purpose college basketball give up the two get the three we gave it up and we knocked it down D Gamble and D to shoot it to knock it down if you over press a pop on the ball yeah its oneonone on the inside really difficult action to defend pick your poison 34 threepoint field goal shooter is locking you see how Clemson is heated up Wake Forest has taken 53 threepoint shots they have not made any and clearly the bulk of the scoring is coming from one guy and thats Salis with six sloppy sloppy start for Wake Forest offensively no threes made by wake in the game so theyre theyre theyre tracking what theyve done all year just shooting 26 from the threepoint line really hard to manufacture offense when you cant stretch people out Devin Cosby another difficult fade away they are getting nothing easy and the fight for the loose ball hildr difficult pass thats off the foot of Spillers Ellie shefflin grabbing that right ankle mhm theres not a player in college basketball that controls the the pulse in the heart of their Club more than Ian sheff not one now hell sit on a table were going Head To Toe with him hes got a foot now and he got poked in the eye earlier so theyll tape that ankle up hell get back in Fosters in form Hyer knocks down another one backto back triples for him good quick offense out of Clemson I talked about they need to score within the first eight seconds of the shot clock theyre not great in short clock situation theyre going to have to figure out a way Jimmy real quick to get easier shots and if nothing else draw some fouls talking about weight yeah yeah no doubt Clemson good job of Defending without fouling Salis he cant get it to go Fields already 615 to go in the first half a dangerous time for Wake Forest hi breeder oh down he goes hard on the ground and a couple of players injured on the play just not able to catch himself at all to break the fall was H breeder good news that hes up and seems to be okay but hes up quickly too he did not get any arm out to support that fall he landed hard on his side and up very quickly now he actually Hy breeder red shirted last year by choice to give him a year to build his body up originally at the Air Force the same time that the Pittsburgh Pirates phenomenal pitcher Paul SK is he left the Air Force he went to LSU to pitch and of course Hy breeder here at Clemson playing basketball you think youd get up that quickly if you hadnt made the previous two threepoint shots maybe not well they they get him downhill they did High reader off of weve talked about Zoom action this year the big up top dribbling at a wing and kind of getting a guy with momentum going down boy not good now a 132 run for Clemson and Wake Forest throwing the ball Applause away so there is shefflin now having his ankle taped people at home we see that all the time obviously its a stabilizer does the pain go away the pain does not go away no but but I Ive had it as a player it does give you confidence right to get back out knowing that its double tap and strong tough drive by Zachary just no resistance by this wake Force defense I I think letting their offense now affect what theyre doing on the defensive ENT theres the number 15 to two run last 330 theyve doubled them up 3015 tyor Johnson number eight as they continue to try to find pieces that would be able to break this Cod he drives hard and he is able to get it to go tyor Johnson course played at Louisville hes got a fast ball in terms of straight line drive you get a little wild at times there that high low action again good rip Johnson in the game making a little impact and I dont think he sto and he goes behind his back then he kicks it back when when eight in Black has the ball somethings going to happen and go back inside a couple of layups off the window that time cron Spillers now if youre wake four you youve got yourself back in the game can you get back to back stops and continue Off the Bench for the six foot sophomore out of Brooklyn New York Tyler Johnson he guards Zachary sheins ankle taped feeling more secure hes back in gets it down low wiggins no good and another chance now for Wig to continue to cut into this lead L Wiggins in a mismatch right off the bat with a speed against Tyler Johnson right just let him go to work last two trips down theyve been able to get it inside for layups they set up a three in the corner and its good hriff knocks it down three trips and three buckets on a 70 run and ravy wake Force ran a little bit of flex action and its not a surprise Steve Ford does an assistant under Bruce Pro see just things you carry around in your back pocket as a head coach you watch college basketball those long threes resulting long rebounds Clemsons been able to come up with rebounds on two of those and then Zachary just lost it they got three on one Salis floats in how explosive was Silas to go up and then hesitate and go up again while hes in the air a very gifted offensive player wake Forces defense now has him back in the game with 327 to go yeah Tyler Johnson continues to be in that plus minus hes heavy into the plus category since hes come on the floor lock and R thats blocked heck of a play by Trayvon Spillers Wake Forest is woken up you can get hot on offense you can also get hot on defense and thats exactly what wake horse is doing right now the guys in Black guarding their own good health defense you guys in halftime we weigh in on this we dont have Ravi a standardized ball in college basketball that we play with all year long theres like five or six different balls out there yeah and every coach you talk to or officials will say why do we not have it NC tournament we play with a Wilson I think its called a Wilson Evo NXT we need a standardized ball we need to widen the lane in college Bas oh I I can see the producer just blowing up the rundown to get that conversation in wait to up youre a producer youre an analyst youre a nugget Creator today no but that that widening of the lane would would create more spacing and freedom of movement which seems to be again what we continue to emphasize at the college level but we should have a standardized ball yeah at this level thats kind of crazy that we Music dont Sal this is what Seth talked about whatever theyve come up with in the half court tough has been difficult and theres Johnson who throws it up and in Tyler Johnson impacting the game in a positive way for Wake Forest yeah chrisy talking about that he has some limitations as this kid but his speed and his explosiveness has really made an impact lock usually you stay at that threepoint line and Hyer knocked down hes third how about the discipline of locking to keep his foot locked in on the floor and not travel a lot of bigs with that shot fak so fast hell drag that foot well done by zero in white that ends an 110 run and lock it ahead of Reed here we go a couple of big guys he lays in foul from behind by Spillers locking the ball handler with the soft kiss and a chance for a threepoint play from Anapa Russia is Victor lockin and he is locked in the last 30 seconds of this game with a high IQ pass and he gets out in that passing Lane and appreciate a sevenfooter bringing it three or four bounces about 60 ft for the Applause finish this kid got married in October we found out the last time we were here against Mary Jilly former volleyball player at Florida International look at how quick Johnson is H with that basketball he blew right by Hunter they call that foul Reed got him with the body before Spillers got him by the arm so Reed has playing with two Hyer he took an elbow up high from hildr there on that drive and I think hrth is being talked to by the officials about that Brad Brownell with the same conversation Watch That Elbow right there clear some space absolutely normally you get the officials attention I I think the look at it Clarence Armstrong Eric Lewis and Jeffrey Clark yeah they are and thats the right thing to do Cameron hildr senior following for right elbow got right up into the face of the defender and it uh it sent Hy Breer back a little bit ooh I think thats excessive unnecessary by hildr on the drive thats that to me is I dont thats not a basketball driving normal move boom right there and we not show I think youre G to Come Away with an F1 and hild since his freshman year has played like a a bull in a China closet in the right way but this time I think that aggressiveness crosses over the line and I will not be surprised at all if they dont see that as excessive and unnecessary you agree no I agree with that Im Im struggling with the China closet Ive heard of like a bull in a china shop but I didnt know so there are China closets out there yes there people keep their to keep their fine CH okay yeah thats I dont have one but that thats going to be destructive if you get a bull in a closet its all gone if you get him in a shop you got a chance to miss some things yeah destructive like high Breeders nose got destructed as he starts going downhill H PR your fouling first and then you never cant judge intent you hear guys talking about it but you cant judge intent youre just judging the action and what happened and hildr to me clearly gets that right arm up right across the bridge of the nose of hi of H High breeder that to me that is not a basketball play yeah I would agree with that that is and you know who else would agree with that that guy right there his nose would certainly speak up if he could right because theyre talking about it so long I think thats what were going to escalate to and now theyre figuring out where the stoppage play is we shoot where we shoot the free throws what we come back that angle fairly telling there appeared to be intent on it our three officials today Clarence Armstrong Eric Lewis and Jeffrey Clark so looks like its going to be a common foul then a flagrant one Jimmy is getting the explanation from Jeffrey Clark ruling on the play is a common foul on white three and a flagrant one on black six so rather because of that youre going to shoot the free throws for the F1 and then Clemson will get the ball out of bounds under because wake fource not in the bonus yet so they dont get their own free throw attempts and thats a thats a big play and thats the right call if you read that description of it right there excessive unnecessary to begin with and not a basketball play H Breer a good free throw shooter knocks down that one and Jake Hy breeder having himself a terrific first half leading everybody in scoring hes got the three threes he knocks down the two free throws he is a specialist 20 of his 28 attempts on the year coming in from the threepoint line H breeder has not missed a shot he is three of three all threepointers and four for four from the free throw line its a bit of a Lamont Butler type game that we saw Lamont Butler the other night where he didnt miss a shot for Music Kentucky Jimmy have you seen the volleyball tournament so far the Womens Volleyball championship has been terrific tomorrow afternoon 3 Eastern noon Pacific ABC in ESPN Plus in English and Spanish Penn State they came from behind to beat Nebraska they will take on Louisville at the KFC y center in Louisville that that atmosphere at the KFC Young Center the other night was as good as youre going to see at any level that thats a big time match in the high low again locking make him playay tyor Johnson may be as quick as anybody from one end of the court to the other while dribbling a basketball that weve seen this year I I would second that some guys have a burst and he certainly does thats the toughness right there Jaden sacur makes a living of as Seth said every shot every play that wake has tried to make have been a grind this is a grind right now yeah they get a hard double on the ball shefflin rotates up and again they dont reach and theyre not slappers they go at the ball and attack with two hands talking about Clemson Johnson quickly gets rid of it he got hammered he goes down and he will come back up and shoot a couple of free throws another foul on Chase Hunter man speed kills and you get that ball screen set on that outer third with no help in the corner and this kids going to get to the paint and get to least the ball up on the glass re you need a guy that can change the game within the game and and Steve Forbes knows this kids got a wild streek in him but at least hes got a burst and explosiveness and a courage to make plays on the Applause road I known Steve Forbes for a long time he reminded me last night we were talking that he has been an assistant coach under three different guys that have gone to the final four Bruce Pearl at Tennessee Greg Marsh at witch State and Porter Moser hes doing a great job at Oklahoma H his team Illinois Chicago fors has been under some of the best yeah Oklahoma off to an unbelievable start one of those teams still unbeaten Zachary throws it high up off the window no good fight into the hands of Frederickson for Wake Forest hes got Salis on the wing and out goes low blocked there by locking this is speed on speed and Johnson wins that battle Salis hard lock it affected it but it didnt matter and a chance for a threepoint play Hunter Salis that is as good as youre going to see at the college level RAV for a guy going full speed and it gets covered up at The Rim by a sevenfooter but he kind of lets the defense Slide by just appreciate what this kid does with his 185 lbs the ability to take the hit hang keep his eyes locked in contact I mean that was impressive and it all started with the hands of Tyler Johnson taking the ball away from Dell Jones on the other end at Hunter Sal stayed in the draft last year he probably would have been a late second round guy they want to see if he could be more of a point guard this year but boy can this guy score in Music bunches low to lock at a big height Advantage Zachary cuts oh a late whistle right in front of the Wake Forest bench and that did not sit well with forbs and his staff it was Jeffrey Clark who made the call a good hard though aggressive cut by Zachary as loan kicks that thing out youre going to have a lot of collisions at The Rim a lot of times those things go uncalled and certainly Steve Forbes thinking that that one should have been one of them he talk about the impact that has had there is not one player other than Tyler Johnson who is in the plus category every other one of them is either zero theres one player or negative he is a plus four the impact that Tyler Johnson has had on this Applause game if youre wake for us you want to take as close as you can to the last shot of the half and go in Down single digits you cannot have ball turnover allow Clemson to get what would be a huge momentum basket to close out this first half figur they would go to Salis here Jimmy no doubt it work I dont even know if he needs string talking about 23 in Black just get him the ball and see if he can go to work oh he had it Johson hesitated what you cant do Ravi Clemson fires a three no good and they will have a chance with 28 on the clock to inbounds the ball underneath the Wake Forest basket and wake very fortunate Clemson got a wide open Clean look from three now they still have right at three seconds to work with and this is you know whose time Chase Hunter has made a living of last second halime or end of game shots watch for a slip as well with Hunter being a decoy now Theo that one is defended blocked and that will end the half he was a decoy they tried to get team 9 and3 one in the ACC last win for Wake Forest here was January 17th and that was a long long time ago Jimmy it was 2009 turn over to start so Wake Forest tries to cut into this ninepoint lead trying to get their offense going they ended up shooting 44 in the first half after such a cold start and Salis led the way with 11 very good hard hedge by Ian shefin to knock Hunter Salis out Reed offensive rebound and on that rebound and pass he got fouled and if its on Chase Hunter thats his third foul thats a big foul for Chase Hunter who really ignited Clemsons offense in that last game in which all 27 points came in the second half against South Carolina yeah he he made three threes in the last 90 seconds to get that thing to an extra period difficult fade away it counts just like that hriff has got them within Music seven locking left open he will not take that sheflin will fire no good the big guy locking goes up he gets it and he had near 6 in on both Sal and Spillers RAV if youre awake you live all afternoon long with shefflin settling for his shots out of the corner and its that high low contact physical game that the ACC fears when they come into this building and Clemson needs to get back to it some yeah Salis just picked up his second little floater and that one finds the Applause bottom Dylan Hunter another bucket getter Chase goes out the younger brother comes in if your older brothers bucket get dont you think youre incl to be a bucket getter try Reed bed his way all the way down low hon Reed is really good ripping and driving the ball from the elbow for a sevenfooter but Zachary stopped on a dime freed himself up and was not get the roll and nobody on the offensive glass for Clemson uncharacteristic given both sheins nose for the ball locking size look at that pick from Zachary hell go oneonone Salis slapped at him thats foul number three on Hunter salace and he is in trouble with 18 to go here in the second half Jadon Zachary 11 in white averages over two steals per game and he loves the physical part of the game of basketball right here he just bam just knocks a Defender out of the way a potential all ACC first team defensive guy Zachary no good goes to follow and its Reed who picks it up hriff stop and no good he came up just a little bit short a wide open shot in the lane by the way you mentioned the two steals of game Zachary is the active ACC Steels leader and hildr who just missed that shot is fifth on the list Music Wiggins wide open it went halfway down Zachary draws the foul he is terrific at that he jumped right into F Reed who picks up the foul now we talk a lot about Ian sheins motor and this kids motor Jaden Zachary is right there with it youre talking about an undersized guy that goes gets a rebound out of his area just tough as Nails as Jaden Zachary hes not the shooter of Joe Gerard last year but a much better Defender much better Handler he was outstanding against Kentucky jamming the ball in the back court slowing Kentucky down starting December 29th four consecutive weeks four straight weeks Sunday womens basketball quadruple headers right here actually will be seen on the ACC Network so Sunday womens sup quadruple headers first lineup andah hogo third ranked Notre Dame hosting Virginia noon Eastern Louisville BC North Carolina Miami in the day capped off by number 21 NC State hosting Clemson what I really like about the womens game this year Ravi it its 8 n 10 teams deep probably in legit National Title contenders and well that womens game just continues to grow in a lot of areas but especially the the the depth of quality teams this year about as good as its been forever Tennessee then forever Yukon South Carolina who lost earlier this year huge game tonight on the womens side with Yukon taking on USC so Beckers and JuJu Watkins will face each other not a good shot there from hild Applause Music nice you know you could lay out and and the guy behind this handle play by play yeah no hes hes just unfortunately hes just not hes not objective theres a theres a bias to the team white Hunter no good Big Time battle for the board and its finally into the hands of hild wide open three knocks it down they let him run into it Hunter Sal buried it where is your transition defensive pickup point for Clemson on that one just lack ofical no urgency at all understanding Salis will bringing that ball the one guy you really have to pay deep attention to good hands from behind knocked Away by Spillers just Tak two or three possessions a half to flip a game Sis got his hand all the way wrapped around Wiggins throws it up and hes going to have a chance for a threepoint play well he was holding off the defender which could have been a foul against him hes going to end up with a chance for three it was a foul against him but heres what Im talking about with Clemson just fall asleep on salz bringing it in right there that is a dribble hole for two or three dribbles only we saw apparently Forbes and a couple of other members of The W Forest Demon Deacons basketball team handing out gifts Its a Wonderful gesture I will say potentially intimidating if you open the door and uh you see a 610 250 Santa hes got a great spirit about him though from Nigeria didnt start playing ball he was 16 years old coach forb is a pretty good job of being the Grinch yeah work well they set up the three thats off to the right Wake Forest has a chance to tie with a Music three theyve outscored him 104 in the second half and Salis with 17 leads the way Advantage here Fon Reed against sheflin no locking down low Shin easy one they quickly quickly got into the high low action that time in their conversion offense you got a sevenfooter passing to a guy that carves out space on the inside sheflin as well as you have in the college game shefin got poked in the eye early and then he suffered an ankle injury in which he had it taped he only has five points and he only has three rebounds last time we were here he had over 20 rebounds in the game locking K to Music double no thats going to be a shot clock violation hild knew it he should have shot it yeah Clemson can put you in some Long offensive possessions watch how quickly Clemson gets into that patented high low the trail guy locking is 611 and shuffling gets right around that Rim area and with one bounce of the ball theyre into their high low action which is lethal deins a double double guy hes got six of them this year including the most recent against South Carolina we talked about in the first half the importance of this game especially for Wake Force this is one of five games left on their schedule as L gets lose that will be a important resume win thats whats at stake right now for the visitors in Black Joel lardy our bracketologist said W needs big wins in a big way and this is a big opportunity in what is a festive but less than sort of an animosity type arena with no students in town the ACC has five quad one wins as a conference three of those are by the Duke Blue Devils and those big Brands Louisville Syracuse Carolina NC State Virginia they theyve got to step up their game College of basketball is not the same without him and theres that open floor lock and just rolls out of it and wait for us Falls completely asleep on the roll guy other the college basketball scores today Duke they rolled over Georgia Tech 8256 cuse gets trounced Yukon wins again in another close one they beat Butler by 47874 and that Florida team in the SCC a lot of people talk about Auburn and Tennessee dont sleep on the Gators they put 99 up today against North Florida yeah they they could win the SEC they their guard Trio of Elijah Martin and will Richard and Walter Clayton Jr as good as we have in the college game you and I will see them at the second playing date of SEC play number one Tennessee at Florida on a Tuesday night good back cut yes and a good bounce pass by lock and whos doing it all great Shooters have to become great Cutters and high breeders starting to do that with all the pressure and all the overplay that Shooters get you got to be able to stick that foot and make them pay at The Rim Hyer 15 Off the Bench today four for five from the floor including his three Music threepointers Sal hes got five on that shot clock theyre deep into it again frericks in wide open needs it doesnt get it locking with a rebound and when youre on the floor to make open shots you got to make open shots I think hes coming out and for is going to go with speed at that position l Johnson looks like hes set to come in sheflin thinks about it knocks it down he was left wide open Forbes wants a timeout Clemson now has extended their lead its now a 10point place was 27° about 61° as puin and ERS get set to do battle again they did that in high school and what should be a good one and many fans here will stay and watch it on the big screen and then tonight a huge one in the Horseshoe Tennessee who travels really well against Ohio State they going to be about what 22 de I believe at some point in the football game game tonight in Columbus you talk about V Nation man did they Roar this morning on college game day they have showed up in force weing theyre theyre orange Zachary wide open just missed that three and that could have made it a 13point game wheres the offense come from Wake for sou than 23 in black circus shot and that one is missed so Johnsons come in missed a three and now a two locking hands and rolls they try the yoop he caught it but he was on his way down and hriff ahead of the field will lay it up and in good job by hild to read that as soon as that ball went up and was an air ball he took off and and nobody for Clemson responsible for defensive balance everybody got attracted to the basketball a foul and Johnsons Twisted an ankle so hes limping towards the bench hasnt been a good couple of minutes for number eight two Miss shots and an ouchie awareness of the the platform that you have and both wake force and Clemson have seized those moments I love the ring toss on the reindeer game by the way not easy maybe bring that to a county fair by the way shefflin looked at the official as if to say I wasnt moving moving and he gets called for the moving screen threepoint shooting has not been great but one thing that weve heard whether its the NBA or college basketball the proliferation of threepoint shots its not going to slow down anytime soon and just the other way on the same call this one against Fon Reed going to explain that to people at home youre trying to stand in the way of somebody and you get whistled for a foul a moving screen yeah those screeners have to come to a set position and they cant their feet cant get outside their shoulders and thats a easy call to make for an official as Fon Reed is moving to disrupt where that Defender was trying to go about the simplest way to put it Fon Reed wears number four and now he sits with four fouls so height Advantage now clearly to Clemson will they go down to lockin First Hunter Fires at three and finds the bottom RAB I kns is really good action because your eyes were drawn to one side of the floor for knowing all along that Hunter was going to operate off of a pin down into a jump shot on the backside lead grows to 11 we got a little less than 11 to play in the second Music half penetration and the kick from Cosby leaves souless with five its going to be a tough shot he fires it up and thats an airball and Clemsons so good for the most part of this game just staying in front of the basketball yeah shefflin went for the long one didnt get it hell just lost Hunter on the offensive end and then Walkins just swallowed the basketball Hunters got numbers lockin went to the table he was hungry and he just ate it and now hes got a chance for an easy one and he gets it that height advant in that high low action weve seen it a handful of times out of Clemson in this game one of the big concerns for Steve Forbes coming in and the impact is having Fon Reed off the floor 13o lead danger time again for Wake Forest theyve been in this situation before and came back a ter turnover leads to a Clemson run out and a hunter pass to lockin he gets two chances its shein on chance number three Steve forb says time out as to the backboard in an easy lay in and Clemson starting to push this thing out locking 13 points nine rebounds so a board away from a triple double and six assists Music H drives hard in a nice lefthanded layup nobody came over shefin got stuck you wont see a lot of straight line drives against Clemson all year theres a complete lack of awareness on the weak side that time re second call and the conversation between loan Clarence Armstrong was I only had one in I pulled it out I I cant remember the last time I saw 3 seconds I cannot remember Music seriously our official behind us claiming lock in was outside the threepoint Lane and I think he echoed your thoughts when he said they never call that there is a rule but they never call no doubt you know what you you get 3 seconds not Beyond 3 seconds great hands that down by the younger Applause Hunter give it to him Quick Pass shefin and that always results in a made three as Hunter knocks it down we saw shefflin do that against Kentucky a couple of times he knows where the balls going when its in Flight towards him great awareness by shefflin to find the shooter 15 turnovers to Wake Forest has really hurt them in this game right off the foot thats turnover number 16 and taking care of the ball one of the things that Brad Brown El so we got to see which team makes threes and which team takes care of the ball right now Clemson is doing certainly taking care of the ball better they have 10 turnovers to the 16 threepoint shooting has been somewhat close but thats also the advantage Clemson a rare pull up two you look how tough that Clemson has guarded in this second half theyve done it without fouling only 14 fouls but their ability to stay in front of the ball and and delete the drive impressive yeah Salis thats a tough shot but hes he got that one down a little fade away as of Salis picks up two more points R he has tremendous elevation on his jump shot hes all of 64 hes a slender kid that only ways a buck 85 but lot of pop in that jump shot Forbes realizes were going to do anything were going to need Le in the game he plays with four fouls that one is not on him but it will send a Zachary to the free throw line to shoot two more yeah Tiger Pride starting to roll the hot hands of that Clemson defense once again by Dylan Hunter and the awareness of Ian shein starting to the postseason one time they got tangled up led to one of the great headlines in the newspaper ever where allegedly Rollins bit Danny a so the headline was was tree bites man that ones hard to beat one of the great headlines as a kid growing up there reading that newspaper are you never forget tree bites man that Clemson defense has been Relentless theyve gotten hot a couple of times with some defensive back to backto back stops but just the consistency that theyve guarded with in this game ravier wake struggles to score anyways averaging 68 points a game theyre not going to get that today hasnt P he gets rid of it again end of clock situation theyre going to have to force something and they turn it over and they now have 17 turnovers Zachary nice touch off the window so tough so strong so determined is Zachary a really good double team of the ball by Clemson to get the turnover and then the weak side defense to rotate over to the first pass 34 points off the turnover thats the difference Clemson 34 points off the 17 turnovers and the next bucket could put him up by 20 or more johy Wiggins gets double team now he buys himself some time and Fades no good grab just not good offense when you go high low the defense takes it away kick the ball out and get the ball reversed by Wiggins Salis for the most part he feels like hes been a oneman show hes got 19 now hild the next closest with 13 other than that no one has more than six now 21 for South and that and that problem May travel with Wake Forest all year long when you break down their personnel and just who can go get baskets 23 in black is really the only guy yeah the ball got hot thats set up Hunter for a quarter three and he knocks it down Applause it all started though with high breeder turning down a threepoint shot that was going to be challenged to swing the ball to the backside very unselfish the right pass by Clemson it feels like most of the college players jibby especially the ones with good programs as soon as your Defender goes by you youre Wide Open Swing that ball around a twoonone could put him up by 20 plus and instead hell shoot two with a chance to go up 20 well to your point Clemson makes the right pass not the extra pass extra passes result in turnovers the right pass is one more right there and its a really good job by high high breeder to initiate the play turn down a three that would have been challenged and get that thing swing swing to the weak Music side Salas joins Reed with four fouls and hes over there talking with Coach Forbes hes front frustration for sure for Hunter Salis reminder 430 Eastern Time Jimmy not not long from now right here on ESPN the mens triple header wraps up with 16th rank Purdue spite of the fact Zach Eds moved on to the NBA a very difficult team to defend they shoot it really well and Auburn they will play in Birmingham I heard a interview with Bruce Pearl the other day just talking about how so many of the guys came there sort of unheralded Johnson Etc and they Janai broom they have become legitimate College Stars they are and Bruce Pearl has always said no one will ever play harder than us and thats a real challenge when you take on a hard playing Purdue team Trey Kaufman Ren and Braden Smith from Purdue the better combos in all of college basketball lead is 20 theres five minutes to go can they cut it in half 3 seconds to go tough shot in the lane by Harris he gets the friendly roll yeah but when youre up 20 and you put your opponent in a full 30 second possession just Pat him on the butt and say Well done and keep playing we gave up two but we won the bigger bout yes thats Juke Harris The Freshman who gets the first bucket of the game for him the H higho action again wiggins not physical though on the inside post up shein no good high to get a rebound wiggin Applause the chef inside the kitchen cant get it to roll thought we were going to see some Kitchen Magic he is so good shefin at bouncing Defenders off of hims very good at getting his chest into your chest and creating space now its a difficult one there to defend Fon Reed a seven quarter going to go with the jump hook against Che whos only Music 68 its interesting that the majority of this crowd has hung with us as the Clemson football game kicks off were going to watch it on the big screen buddy were not going anywhere no sit right here and party with us thats what were Music doing Diet Cokes and Patty Mills of course thats how high part yeah little mac and cheese I dont know about that but Patty mton di Co watching up to North Carolina today Joe lardy projecting four teams out of the ACC thats a thats a low number for a power League North Carolina sitting there as an 11 SE like theyre right there on the edge of being bumped out and thats a thats whats wrong with this league right now those powerful Brands I talked about it earlier theyve got to step up their play Louisville Syracuse Carolina NC State Virginia those brands have to be good like in any power league and when theyre not that League suffers things running Cycles the AC C cares a lot about basketball but they have to take a look atsel right now in terms of what have other leagues done like the SEC and the Big 10 yeah to be projecting 10 11 12 foul at the rims spers went up for a dunk well the SEC appears poised to have in historically great season now theyre about to beat the heck out of each other as we get into conference play but the competition level really top to bottom maybe as good as its ever been I I think it this is as good its ever been and it could be the best league weve ever seen in College of basketball maybe historically ever theres a chance the SEC could put 14 teams in the number keeps growing yes the NCAA tournament and you go n n That League this year or 8 and 10 I think youve solidified your spot because of the major work that league has done in nonconference play Music final two and a half minutes here Clemson on their way to their 10th Victory and go two and0 in conference W Forest has to go back to the drawing board to figure out how theyre going to be able to come up with a alternative offensive player Hunter fires the three thats down and Applause out Ravi as we get close to the holiday season and Christmas next week week you know we all kind of pause and reflect on life and I want to just talk quickly about Steve Forbes his wife Jetta yes just over a year ago she spent 42 days in the hospital last fall suffering from a stroke and she has made remarkable Improvement and talking to Steve yesterday about the challenge that has been in his housee last year coaching and and taking care of her and certainly a lot of people still giv great wishes and prayers for Ed to make a full recovery and shes shes doing great from what Steve told me so Merry Christmas to that forb family next week yeah now we always think about what the coach is dealing with he was in Kuwait by the way as shein comes in here to lay it up and then he was in Kuwait 7000 mil away when he got the call about it it took him two days to get home to be with her you know you talk about Janetta and her recovery he said doing the things you dont want to do every day in order to get the things you want out of life thats coaching and thats what shes doing doing the think about it Duke being projected as a two seed right now pit and Clemson as a seven seed and North Carolina probably one loss away from being in that first four next four out and those games matter right now when Duke and North Carolina come in here Brad brownill knows it good job of taking care of business today I ha I didnt get to talk to the tiger before he went off the air no but the tiger is not thinking about you jimm hes think about whats next in the life of the tiger a graduate of Clon University you know whats next the Auburn Tigers at the bottom of the Music Applause hour a major major matchup Auburn could very well win the SEC and Purdue could very well win the Big 10 that that one going to have the feel of an elite eight Final Four game yeah and look I think to the credit of the colleges and their coaches there have been a few of those games early this season that have felt like Elite Gam terrific I was at one a couple of weeks ago with Shi Kentucky at Gonzaga just some games feel different and that one coming up 430 Eastern will have that feel final seconds here want to wish everybody at home a safe happy holiday season with all the health in the world for the upcoming new year no doubt our final score is Clemson 73 Wake Forest 62 partner have a
