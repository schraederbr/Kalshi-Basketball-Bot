Johan Grunlow and out of Germany will tip for Virginia and BCs going to win the tip to start this one off Big man and Ben Capki saw him take some warmup threes and through the hands of Jaden Hastings That one goes out of bounds and an early turnover for the Eagles Tried a little high low action there You know defensive end of the floor for BC has been pretty consistent all year long Its on the offensive end where they have really struggled to score Not so much for Virginia Virginias been very strong when it comes to scoring and they dont make a lot of mistakes Theyve got a couple big men to work through You talked a lot about Tester Ritter He hasnt even touched the ball yet And there he is Three on the way And in and out Dumblo cant hold on to that one in Boston College And this is what theyre going to have to do BC is a rebound as a group Nice little floater there for Fred Payne Well Payne has been terrific Hes been their most dynamic scorer but really that type of game from all five and whoever comes in for BC Lewis three on the way in and out cheering applause Payne also pretty good rebounder for his position Just under four a game That floater doesnt go Ditter ends up with it Mishandles it The crowd here wanted to walk maybe Thomas nice spin move to the basket and he gets two Yeah And uh after that play it looked like these things are just a basketball play but Thomas got hit in the nose and hes having trouble seeing right now Yeah its always the eyes start to water Oh no Its that left eye Its almost nice turn around there for Jake Hastings Hall for three And that one cant go Well so far its been pretty much one shot and out which is exactly what BC needs to do We talked to Earl Grant He said he wanted to control the tempo That was the way they had success with Syracuse and Pit and that one off the front of the rim Offensive rebound though pulled down by Kapki and it looks like a foul is going to be called Kapki is going to get called on the hook that time Theres O Grant I was talking to him about tempo Uh really in his fifth season here at Boston College uh he still is working on kind of that old school of building these kids character too Not just bringing them in to win basketball games but uh making them better making them better men Well and its easier too to control tempo and to slow it down than it is to speed it up And uh so if youre looking to do that dictate that you easier to do especially at home cheering Dunk doesnt go for Lewis but a foul on the play Looks as though that ones going to go against Hastings Second personal foul early for Hastings And I dont you see the record there 9 and 11 And Rick I cant remember I looking youre looking at the statistics total team scoring BC and opponents one point difference between the two over 20 games Yeah over 20 games and and they just been on the on the wrong side and theyve had leads in a lot of those games Lewis cheering at the line misses the first Hes a 75 free throw shooter on the season And Lewis gets that call because of the cheering aggressive move to the basket and the dunk attempt cheering And the second one doesnt go as well but we applause have a foul on the rebound And looks like that ones going to go against Grunlow applause Yeah I mean you know this early in the game for one of your primary shot blockers to try to get an offensive rebound on a on a free throw And uh thats just not a good foul to give away Davis handling the ball bringing it up court and very impressive when he has the ball as far as shooting threes Davis has BEEN A 47 free throw shooter BUT WHAT A SHOT THERE BY DONALD HAN JR cheering taking it all the way to the rim Yeah very aggressive things really opened up for him The lane nobody coming over to challenge him Pall kicks out to Grunlow Grunlo lefthanded Nice little hook in and a lazy pass has Lewis stealing it Dinner wanted to take it to the hole Thats what Virginia does They really go transition from offense to defense quickly You cant be casual Thomas nice move to the rim but couldnt get that one to go Theyve gotten into the lane area and have not been able to finish on a couple of occasions Three on its way Good applause and one applause foul to go on Hall Take another look at this drive in Well its just a great pump fake You see cheering you get the big shot blocker outside to show Once you get by him theres a clear sailing and then thats just really good concentration by Fred Payne Gets a three to go and a fourpoint play Virginias going to bring in Jakari White Jakari broke his left wrists back December 20th uh after a dunk and landing hard on the floor And that is Fred Payne completing the fourpoint play applause And Virginia would really like for Jakari White to get into shape as quickly as possible Well its been a little bit of a slow road in his games back but he is an excellent threepoint shooter which is exactly what they need Yeah as a matter of fact had 12 consecutive threes from November 28th to December 6th over three different games Thats a Virginia record Nice move to the hole And theyre going to call the foul on the floor Derritter We mentioned him earlier the 23yearold freshman played professionally in Spain but this is what makes him tough Rick The at his size the ability to put it on the floor He can face up You have to honor a shot but very good at getting to the line Talk about 15 free throw attempts in that Notre Dame game 32 points his careerhigh Scary White driving in with the right hand broke the left wrist and he makes a nice little threefooter And uh for a guy like that whos on the road back to come in and hit his first shot an easy layup like that is a big confidence builder College goes back to work cheering and the takeaway by Virginia Three on the way It is good Chance Mallalerie and Han fell down on that turnover late getting back on the play and thats what allowed Mallerie to get the good look and that will take us to our first break with team um following in his dads tradition of coaching women in basketball But uh and its funny I dont think a lot of people are talking about this Virginia team and they should be Yeah 17 and three already 17th ranked but impressive And speaking of impressive look at Tavis all the way to the rim there Yeah And that shot blocking has not been there for Virginia because BC has been very aggressive at the rim And White for three Its good Yeah You know I tell you you come in and you get an easy start like that and all of a sudden things open up for you This may be the game that theyve been waiting for him to get back into a good rhythm Yeah White 47 from outside that arc Uh very impressive as far as his threepoint shooting 32 of 68 so far this season Now 33 of 69 actually Drive to the basket Cant get that one to go but a foul applause cheering You can tell I mean heres the look I mean theyre going to they can prove himself a little late getting out there but no hesitation for him Kappys going to go to the line Hes a just over 70 free throw shooter And this a little surprising to me Greg that you know if Im if Im defending BC coming in and Im going to pack the lane a little bit make them prove themselves from the outside theyve been getting to the rim much too easily But to their credit that foul was on Chance Mallerie by the way And second one wont go Don Hall bringing the ball up Spent a 100 games at BYU before making the move to Virginia May be their best playmaker too at his size and strength really makes great decisions Chance Maller working into the paint but kicks it back out again Devin Tillis offensive foul Were going to call that a charge applause Looked up at the shot clock and then put the shoulder down That one was that one was close to me You I was going to say do you agree with the call or no That was that was and it it is it is really difficult with the with the rules and the officiating to get a charge call TO THE RIM AND DOWN FOR FRED PAYNE AH and how about that go route by Donald Han Jr Fullcourt pass no dribble dunk BC is trying to get Virginia to wake up here That three is short Dwight helped with the rebound but Chance Valerie White thought about the three Well and you can see now hes hes reacting more out on the floor than just kind of thinking through things The righthanded hook there by Onion Soap and it doesnt go Yeah And theyre going to BC talked about it Theyre going to play their centers oneonone inside Theyre not going to come in and double team They think they can handle those guys whether its Grimbo or Oni Look at the long three No eightfooter Its a little too strong It gets kicked out and Boston College throws it back in Chance Mallerie goes up and looks for the contact Got it And thatll be the foul How about this pass Yeah its just uh right down the middle of the lane and and thats uh thats textbook right there But great communication on taking the ball out of bounds Virginia aggressive pressing up the floor You go long You go long Mallerie at the line Hes an 80 free throw shooter And his off the front of the rim Thats been a strength in Virginia 70 on the year but uh 0 of three so far in this game Valeries second shot cheering and that ones good Back within one Hey they got the safeties and cornerbacks back that time on the out of bounds It wasnt prevent defense there Virginia adding that fullcourt pressure Eagles going back to work and nice little pass inside and dumps off to Kafki for two Thats another thing they BC wanted to concentrate on those paint assists drawing the shot blocker over and then giving the little dish White takes it in It falls short Grindlo with the rebound passes it off to Ditter A nice little two really the first offensive rebound for score that Virginia has gotten in this game eight minutes in BC working the ball around and now Chase wants to push it to a twoman game and White gets his hand on it and Im sure White a little bit hesitant to go to the floor after the broken left wrist but they end up with it So Virginia grabs the And in this game uh Ditter has been slow and he hasnt forced anything Hes only taken two shots has two points but I you know and and you talked about um you talked about White hitting the floor That may be the moment where he said he puts the injury behind him getting up from that and saying Im good You know Ive Ive now tested everything Long three on the way and it doesnt even draw iron So Don Hall whos been shooting just under 32 from outside the arc Yeah I mean this is everything If you are going to test the guy on this lineup for Virginia out there hes the guy that you want to take have take shots Virginia So much pressure on the inbound here College back into their half court offense And the three on the way no good DC gets the offensive rebound Well nice job getting the 5050 ball right there The hustle says Forte the drive to the basket Cant make it go Gets his rebound Kicks it back out Kappys going to put it down They have done a really nice job with their interior passing and their big guys have been ready to catch and finish You can see I mean theyre playing way off the ball Brunlo gets the ball tapped out of his hands and then the scuffle on the floor and Possession arrow goes to Boston College Hes a cop shes a con but together theyre unstoppable The CWs hit series Wild Cards Theres Monday with an all new episode Dont miss Wild Cards Monday at 87 Central right here on the CW It looked like Runro actually lost a little concentration He put the ball on the floor He was looking to pass instead of score And uh BC able to get the deflection Chance Valerie back into the lineup and Hall will sit Odum said with Mallerie he doesnt start but he wants him on the floor when the game is on the line Just a winner Yeah And with well with Der out too is a very small lineup out there for Virginia Its basically four guards and onenso and foul cheering there on Malik Thomas First personal foul for Thomas and team fifth So two more and BC will be shooting free throws One of the other things coach ODM brought up was kind of the way that theyve started different games either down by a ton or up by a ton Nice little turnaround there by Capki Well and Capy hes gotten some easy looks inside All of a sudden his offense starting to come along Hes got six already Averages nine on the year Valerie gets it down inside to Devin Tillis Tillis working He kicks it back out Mallerie thinks about the three Drives in Nice little floater and gets his own rebound and puts it back Nice job that time by Mallerie staying with it Its interesting how whoever is posting up now with this group Theyll put some guards in there in the low post for Virginia but BC not coming with the double team still having a hard time getting control of the ball here Both sides actually drive in and dish and the turnaround doesnt go and so Agent Shaw missing that one Thomas for three Tries to bank it in It doesnt go applause yet also cant make the little bunny He got an easy look on an offensive rebound But I tell you what I mean BC has done a nice job getting back in transition defense Virginia has not gotten much off the break Donald Han Jr pulling that defense inside Chapy hits the three Yeah you know come on 27 on the year but he has not missed in this game cheering And its 2317 the Eagles Well those are the type of effort Those are the stats theyre going to need today across the board And he has stepped up his game Coach Grant said we can get all five players playing together He thinks theyre one of the best in the ACC And a nice little move there Tillis for two Boy you look at it and just a lot of people bodies standing around for Virginia That was just a really strong oneonone effort by Tillis and Jr working around the perimeter Drives in was thinking about that little eightfooter Three on the way again This one off the back of the room A Shaw doesnt take very many threes That was just his uh 13th three that he has taken this season Hes only made one Kick back out to Virginia on its way from Allie Short cheering Onion was called for over the back Well we look at Bowden Capi stepping back Only 13 made threes on the year but hes seeing a big basket today And remember Virginia theyve had some some interesting starts to games They were up 16 against North Carolina ended up losing that game Then they were down 19 to Notre Dame and ended up winning that game Had that heartbreaking loss to Virginia Tech Mallerie drives to the basket Reverse is good Bring actually sealed the shot blocker that time Hastings allowing him to get to the rim Think if they can get Ditter some touches in these last seven minutes get him in some sort of rhythm offensively Davis kicks it out Three on THE WAY IS GOOD FRED PAY cheering YEAH we called his name early has been a little quiet but uh hes got 11 points already Very efficient Four or five Hes hit both of his threes Theyve been tough contested shots Lewis three on the way No good cheering And BC with the rebound Lost a handle White picks it up Another turnover by Boston College Carrie White but considering where it was really good job by BC recovering Throws the ball into Der He kicks it back out Three on the way No good from Mallerie and a run here Lets see how Brumo does cheering He lets him go Donald Han Jr with the dunk applause Theyve just gotten ahead of Virginia a few occasions Ditter couldnt handle it there Brunow for three Its off the left side of the rim cheering and arms locked up Lets see what they call here Its going to be on Jakari White cheering Theres the look we talk about at the lefthander and Jakari White really got a nice hand up good pressure good concent concentration And then Hand has been auditioning for the football team in this game on the run Hes been uh breaking away from the secondary Boston College with a sevenpoint advantage The bench has been giving Virginia their most points 15 so far applause And now Paul gets called Well and you know one you dont be picking up a foul out near the half court line You want to be aggressive with you know defensively But now that puts BC in the bonus Theyll shoot one and one And Fred Payne goes to the line A 78 free throw shooter Best free throw shooter for the Eagles And as quickly as I say it I jinx Youve got touch in this game so far Your free throw defense has been outstanding It has been still working the right side Heres a guy thats a guy theyll put in the post cheering And theres a shot block by Jaden Hastings We mentioned Virginia and how good they are Well Boston College is right behind him as far as block shots Well heres that look and you see no double team except late And thats when a shot blocker can be really effective Good body on the initial shot and then Hastings coming in They call the travel and a turnover for Virginia Youre watching CW Courtside Saturday presented by All State Youre in good hands I talked to the Virginia people and they said rarely do they have a bad shooting game back to back They struggled in that Notre Dame game and uh really struggling on the offensive end here Three on the way Pay goes to the ground after he shoots it That one lost the mark Yeah he tried buying he tried buying three free throws there cheering The Ritter looked at the three kicks back around Great ball movement for Virginia and they still cant get a three to go applause cheering and that one goes back to Boston College Well you know and Ditter has really been passive in this game Hes been the ball Hes been moving the ball quickly and been unselfish but I think he needs to get going offensively Virginia shot 13 threes and only made two shooting 15 to start this game Just under 435 to play the first half Drive it into the paint and that one off to the right for Donald Han Jr and Oni Enzo was the one who really altered that force the fadeaway jump shot just kind of looming in front of the lane in front of the rim Been almost three minutes since Virginia has scored with ball in hand He drives left and makes left Thats why its so good going either way Talked about his ability to when you get when you catch at the free throw line with a live dribble it is tough to defend didnt mention the 23yearold out of Belgium And that one off the back of Paul He didnt know it was coming They got tipped Now Fred Payne trying to set up the offense If he had turned around it been the easiest turnover ever Galluke not good but the follow for Jake Hastings is applause and cheering Well the big guys have uh really responded offensively for BC Hastings capping 13 points between them And the crowd trying to get in the head of Virginia Anytime Hall is touching it theyre reminding him his three didnt hit the rim Tillis is off the mark Nice pass inside So and he makes a nice move for two I think that was a good decision by Hastings is to kind of lay off it So a good free throw shooter If he were a 50 free throw shooter maybe take a foul there put him on the line And a little backst step jumper from the Ritter to Ritters going to pull down the rebound Now Thomas setting up still down five Virginia cheering Three on the way and that one wont go Virginia struggling from the threepoint line today BC doing a very good job on the glass so far Davis drives in Jumper from the free throw line No good Hall gets the rebound It looks like a foul Its going to be called on Jaden Hastings That will be his third if its on Hastings Boston College ahead 3025 This is no you know walkin W Havent seen a lot out of Ditter Over to Thomas Thomas loses the handle and that one goes out of bounds but it looks like might have been tipped And isnt it interesting Its its as this first half has progressed BC is really challenging Virginia from the perimeter Theyre laying theyre giving you know theyre going to theyre going to encourage the threepoint shot until Virginia gets going And were seeing coach Earl Grant say All right we want you to check this one to see possession Who touched this last The officials called that it was off of following play under review Boston College is challenging the out of bounds Well your favorite board game is now your favorite game show All new episodes of Scrabble hosted by Craig Ferguson airs this Thursday at 87 central right here on the CW Take a look and see Yeah thats BCs ball I mean that thats thats a pretty obvious call I think it looked like it went off of Thomass hand right there And I think they thought Fred Payne got in there and got a hand on it but the angle that we were able to show clearly shows that Fred Payne wasnt probably within a foot of it And I you know the thing thats been impressive to me is is Fred Payne its been a very efficient he hasnt forced anything in this half 11 points shot the ball very well four rebound Hes the leading rebounder as well with four Coach Grant for Boston College said the one thing he wants people to know about his team is we compete They might not be you know in the middle of the ACC right now but he thinks that theyre that caliber They can be competing for you know middle of the pack ACC And he thinks that if if they come together as a team theyre as good as anybody in the ACC They just havent been able to put that game together But he said We compete Thats the one thing I want everybody to know is that no matter where we are if were home or away were going to put the best five out there and the effort is going to be there Well unless their referees are seeing something that we didnt see its taken a while to sort this call out and uh um but you know for Earl Grant hes going to build on the defensive end of the floor I mean I you know what whats the I dont see that theres Yeah and theyre still having a you know Yeah Fred Fred knew right away that he didnt have anything Mu challenge has been successful Boston College basketball 30 seconds on the shot clock They will retain their timeout applause So its a good use of the review there And again coming up on the halftime show presented by Subaru Love Its what makes Subaru Subaru talk a little bit about Notre Dame Syracuse coming up at 6 tonight as well as big womens double header tomorrow for ACC And up to this point uh the half has unfolded about as well as BC could have scripted it Gaffy going to work and able to shut that one down But once again even off the block shot where it was I mean that for Virginia thats normally turned into a fast break bucket but BC reacted very well Now to Ritter that left arm to work his way in and open up good I mean you know for a guy like that youre going to shout youre going to shade his right hand and uh but he is so good with either thats what makes it difficult Six points now for Ditter Second half of BC may come on a double team with him inside That was the one thing that Boston College didnt want to do And a nice little move inside is good for Donald Han Jr Boston College didnt want to double team guys because Virginias so good at dumping that ball off to the open man And uh but you know to this to again to this point if the shots not there let him hit a couple of threes before you make that change Valerie working that shot clock down About a second difference between game clock and shot clock Under five seconds Shot on the way No good No call Mallerie cant get it off And that will end the half Boston College 32 Virginia Crowd getting behind the Eagles as we get ready to get this second half underway They havent forgot about Hall missing the rim Every time hes touching it theyre letting him know Lewis drives in kicks out Derritter is going to go in and nice little righthander there for Ditter You know you want a guy to beat you with his weak hand but Ditter scored most of his points going to his left time the sixoot jumper goes for Derritter and he has eight points now They need him to be very aggressive in this 20 minutes So the floater there and Pay gets his own rebound Cant get the second one to go either They push it up quick Here comes Malik Thomas Loses the handle and once again Bruno on the ground Thomas comes up with it Theyre going to call jump ball Its going to be BC basketball Right idea rushing it up the floor but just uh losing control of the dribble A lot of pressure inbounding the ball Tavis brings it up Nice drive and looks like the Ritters going to get called for this one The fastest growing cable news network in all of television is News Nation NewsNation respects all Americans and is news for all Americans To find NewsNation on your screen go to newsowcom So at the line Aiden Shaw will shoot a 60 free throw shooter And as soon as he caught the ball he knew what was going to happen with it I mean he has not been part of the offense so far in this game but nice job drawing the foul Transfer from Missouri has 135 rebounds Lead the team for Boston College on the boards Paul brings this one up Kicked into Gruno and an easy dunk for Johan Gruno Yeah they had five guys out that time and Gruno did a nice job screening then rolling in No help presence at all for BC Ive been able to watch Johan Grunlow for the last four years Uh he played on a pro team in Germany that my son played on So I watched probably 60 or 70 games of Johan Grunlo and Grunlow for the rebound but doesnt need to be there as Donald Han Jr knocks down the two So what am I even doing here Rick I mean you could do both and play by play I thought you would know I thought you would enjoy the fact that these big men are showing off And then Lewis throws the three in And thats huge for Virginia They could not find a threepoint basket in the first half Two of 16 That is the first as we see Hall surprised by this win Thats the first three There you see the screen the roll inside But its all you know all you know hand has got decent size but cant cover a gu a center in there Its been over 16 minutes since Virginia had made a three So like you said very welcome to see a three go down for them Davis is no stranger to shooting the threes Nice little pass inside and theyre going to get looks like Bruno for the foul here Second personal foul for Gruno And you know theres a there are two components to it One uh the the good interior passing but your big guys have to be ready to catch And and Keepy really has has made himself available gotten himself open and gotten some good looks knocks down the first of two now Capsky with 10 points in the game and 11 cheering So Virginia had pulled within one and now threepoint advantage again for the Eagles They tried going back to that same play with Grumball inside Mallerie with the offensive rebound Cant make his shot go He was looking for contact instead of concentrating on the shot Long three Payne cant get that one to go Rick one of the things BC people talked about was shot selection in this game and uh you know theyve theyve done a nice job up to this point but that was a really quick three by Payne That foul was on Payne on this end of the floor Little hand check Now Virginia with an opportunity to tie this up Derritter a nice lefthander again and they pull back within one 10 points for Ditter Well we talked about these are two of the better shot blocking teams not only in the ACC but in the country and uh hasnt been a factor this afternoon so far This was great how Derritter immediately Were going to take a look at this left Yeah just uh going right around Its you know on the off hand playing defense there He had his arms wrapped around Had his hands wrapped around Han Jr when he came in but he right away said You got to call him for traveling Well and already four team fouls for Virginia So theyre in jeopardy of letting BC get into an early bonus situation That was Ditters second personal foul as Runlo will go off and bring in Aenso Jr for a second shot Interesting little hitch right before he lets it go reminded me of Charles Barkleys golf swing except he made that free throw Thats a good point Charles really hits the fairway Virginia trying to move the ball around Thomas drives in Nice little pump fake Were going to delay a game warning cheering touching the ball after it went through the rim But you look at Thomas and this is a very tall Virginia team and their guards are very solidly built so they can get into the lane and draw contact Boston College looking for that open shot again drives in just inside the free throw line and it will not go for hand cheering and another turnover for Virginia Big paint took it all the way to the basket Cant make that one go Ditter drives kicks out and that one is going to go out of bounds but Virginia is going to be able to hang on to it is all tied up here inside Theyve had some strugg Theyve had injuries but uh theyve had trouble regaining momentum Cameron Boozer 248 and five assists in that win cheering Continues his play McNeel for NC State 28 against Wake Forest We saw Lewis drive to the basket and theyre going to count the bucket And so first lead for Virginia and hell have the and one Yeah thats a the body right there And that was a good call with the allowing the finish cheering and he completes the N1 So now Boston College and foul off ball and grabbing the ball or grabbing the jersey I think its going to be Sam Lewis Theres been a lot of pressure and Ky wide open this past half court Thats not I mean use him as a release and then just fill in get the ball in and over half court and you driving in turnaround jumper good really nice defense much better offense that time cut hand off on the drive but a really tough finish and Thomas got Steager in the here and Virginias been hyper aggressive in attacking the rim But heres the hand You see this is what you want to do Cut off the drive force a guy into a fall away jump shot Hand just beat you with better offense Thomas goes to the line Hes shooting two cheering First is good Saturday February 14th NASCAR returns for a brand new season and a new partner with the OReilly Auto Parts Series races into historic Daytona International Speedway music Its 33 weeks of pure raw racing that begins Saturday February 14th from Daytona And the second one good for Thomas You shouldnt even needed a card for that race laughter Well wait a minute Two guys Two guys involved Thats like motor memory for you Yeah we were going to have Adam Alexander talk a little bit about the start of the season Uh but it didnt end up working out with the NC State Wake Forest game See Gapy and theres going to be an offensive foul there Kapi gets called for it Well if you are going to get the screen you got to wait for that screener to get set There was just not good timing on that play which is why Keepki get the foul Keep got the foul Shakari White back on the floor for Virginia The big man for the Cavs So the right hand doesnt go and the fight for the rebound cheering And the officials are going to say thats applause BC ball BC ball Another great move there by Han Jr cheering All the pressure on the inbound Shaw trying to find somebody open Yeah its not an easy plays with him not being able to move to get the ball in 7 seconds off the clock just to get it past midcourt Three on its way No good The offensive rebound and applause then the shot blocked Jaden Hastings pulls down the board but that was on all over the block shot shooting two shots and Hastings goes to the line shooting two Its been a uh its been a different story for Virginia shooting the basketball in this second half Six of 10 one of one from the threepoint line and perfect from the free throw line So playing more like Virginia and BC has gotten off to a little bit of a sluggish start two of eight for the half Hastings with the second free throw Hes a 50 free throw shooter So by the numbers he makes the second one The point guards for both teams are having to work in this game because it has been fullourt pressure just and just straight up mantoman fullcourt pressure on the point guards AND DUNKS IT cheering and the foul And Virginia has had success that high screen roll and then the fade inside and just really nice catch going away from it in the finish Thats just good basic basketball One shot on cheering shooting one And Virginia now with a fivepoint lead largest lead for Virginia after they hadnt led until this second half cheering And thats going to put BC at the line for the rest of the half So theyre shooting in the bonus right now from just about the 14minute mark Coach ODMs not happy about that See if BC as a team can shoot higher than their average Uh 66 as a team coming in Thomas comes back out onto the floor Chance Mallerie will sit James Forte at the line and off the front of the rim for his first of oneonone Now in this game its going to make a difference This is the second front end of oneonone theyve missed in this game cheering Hall has been a little bit gunshy cheering The crowd reminding him about his previous three and BC is encouraging too But what a beautiful up and under by Kique Thomas Yeah their guards are really creative in the paint Red Payne brings the ball down and Big BC with the big lineup out there as well Things in Captain Shot blockers and another foul Heres that look It just uh you know when once you get past Hastings all he had to do was concentrate on the finish And Junior has shot the most free throws for Boston College this year And theres that almost check at the top of his shot And and as as a team Virginia you have to pay attention to that when hes at the line so you dont get a violation late in the game I think uh thats exactly what Clarence Armstrong was talking to Ditter about Second one is good as well applause So fivepoint advantage right now for the Whos cheering White working the left side Kicks it out to Hall Thomas will drive in and a nice little layup by Billy Thomas Well you got the switch when you get Hastings outside on him and thats advantage to the guard They get their shot blocker out front and that was an easy drive 145 run for Virginia Little runner there and Fred Payne puts down the two First time weve mentioned his name in this half with about 8 minutes to go Hes another guy Hes a guy needs to start to be aggressive cheering and offensive applause Onenso that time didnt get set on the screen and couple sevenfooters for Virginia that have been great especially Bruno on the glass and rebounds as well as block shots You combine their numbers its about 15 points 12 rebounds and almost five block shots a game Thats terrific productions in that position Nice little pass INSIDE AND THE FINISH FOR JADEN HASTINGS applause very impressed today with cheering BCs interior passing Thomas for three and its too strong Bruno with the rebound cheering His putback doesnt go and now Boston College on the move Great little run in cheering Donald Han Jr for two applause cheering Oh and the reach in Chase Forte is going to get called for that one Three of last three for field goals And White for three up back room applause trying to see if he still had touch from the first half That might have been a little early in the shot clock And this one tipped back out Nice pass inside and Hastings gets cheering it and one applause BC hanging in there on the glass doing a good job And they get the second chance right here Look at it just drawing in And uh big guys better take the guards out for dinner after this game laughter And after leading the whole first half they take the lead back just the second time And so Jaden Hastings finishes it out the threepoint play And it looks like Grunlos Grunows going to have to sit because that was his third foul cheering Just under 11 minutes to play in regulation And I say that because Virginias last game was a double overtime And they had two guys foul out in that game So fouls were an issue Derritter being one of them cheering Dritter backing down Capy and nice easy little hook over him You know I think Kapky was actually thinking he was coming back to his left hand which he had done most of the game but finished with the nice righthanded jump hook and its tied back up again Boston College pass tipped three on the way and that one misses the rim Nice job Jakari White getting a hand up Really challenging making that a tough three So the the few that are here cheering Virginia on now trying to make their voices heard cheering The Ritter Hell kick it back out to White White for three Its good Thats a pretty good twoman game right there You get you know when both guys are able to hurt you I think Jakari White hes going to get some open looks in that situation cheering Nice move there from Donald Han Jr Theres a little bit of talking going on in this game this afternoon Good to see spirited driving left And now a mismatch here Well see if he takes him all the way to the glass cheering And the foul called there There it is This is the play I mean you got it there was a twoman game before then and White is a guy whos going to pick and pop hand We talk about the size and strength of Virginias guards Hes pretty good inside as well Jitter heads to the line Last game at Notre Dame had a season and careerhigh 14 points from the free throw line Now right now BCs got four guys in double figure scoring Rick So theyve got people who stepped up It hadnt been just uh pain in hand cheering And Jer will make the second as well And inbound pressure continues for Virginia And this is more if they get it if they get a takeaway fine But its more to just uh shorten the shot clock for BC which we havent seen really either team have any problem with the shot clock today And this one intercepted Too much air under it for this team And Ditter heads up steel Ditter to Lewis Lewis for three a little strong cheering and a foul on the rebound Were going to call that on Fred Payne Payne gets his second personal foul Just Mallerie will go to the line Excuse me Chance Mallerie you know chance the the correlation cheering between Ryan ODM the Cavaliers if you remember Ryan ODM was the coach at UNMBC when they were 16th ranked and upset Virginia at number one They had a superstar in KJ McClur in UNMBC that didnt look like as far as a physical specimen didnt look like he was the guy who would be their goto guy Thats kind of the situation with Chance Mallerie Maybe not the look that you would have for a goto guy but they go to Chance Mallerie because he can win games Well but its a its you know it was a good rerecruit for Ryan ODM in that you know he committed to Tony Bennett Hes from Charlottesville and uh you know got Ryan came in and they got him to honor that commitment So you know great to have him stay at home But for a freshman terrific assist to turnover ratio Thats what gets my attention Almost 31 which is unheard of Pass inside Leandon good for Jaden Hastings And you know the big guys for BC have gotten confidence in their offense and they are challenging the shot blockers inside cheering Virginia up by two in no hurry right now Ditter drives in and that ones good for two Thats a tough tough cover for Kapki Face up Derritter puts it on the floor so well and Kapia probably better defender inside 10 to four run for Virginia They have a fourpoint lead Jump stop Callahan Jr gets it out and 5 seconds on the shot clock That one in and out but a foul on the floor applause Look like Bowden Capski might end up at the line and a lot of time still to play 727 728 actually remaining in the game And lets see if BC I mean theyre going to be in double bonus from here on out but um lets see You know theyve gotten to the line more than Virginia but havent capitalized on it like they can Just as you say that Yep The first one misses for CapKeep Nine of 17 now And against the top 20 team like Virginia you cant you cant give away those points Virginia somewhat of a scoring explosion in the fact that 15 of their 20 games they have scored 80 plus points uh really on target for that zero or 2000201 season where they had 21 games over 80 points as Jitter works in and cant get that one to fall again Theyre just especially in the low box BC choosing not to go and double team Hastings played him well that time Eagles with a chance to tie it up drive in and that was blocked but looks like a foul applause Lanzo was going to get called for the foul and it was you know it was and it was a foul but it looked like Donald Han Jr was looking to pass off on that play and fortunately was put on the line DJ makes the first One of the things that I heard from Earl Grant was hes most impressed with Donald Han Jr because hes on track to get his degree doing the work here at BC Didnt go didnt go searching out another place um you know decided cheering to to stay here and continue the work You touched on it earlier Most improved player in the league last year Ditter thinking about the three A lot of pressure on him as he works his way inside the righthanded hook Doesnt go cheering and BC comes up with the rebound but a foul get Ditter And right now Rick I mean theyre its throwing the ball to Derritter and watch him dribble and attack the basket Really nobody there No ball movement no player movement for Virginia And that will send Jaden Hastings back to the line Jaden was a fourstar recruit coming out of high school now his sophomore year here But you know but that philosophy of not coming to double team theyre staying at home on shooters and he has nobody to kick it to That doesnt go Sunday February as both free throws dont find the net there Paul continues to get the input from the crowd here cheering Paul drives in into the paint Thomas under three seconds on the shot clock and thats good Wow Almost behind the backboard Yeah And uh just he really bailed Virginia out that time That one goes in as the shot clock expiring But thats you know thats the advantage having guards You got to have an awareness of the clock Pain fading away and it goes cheering A nice BC bounce 15 points now for Bane cheering Mallerie gets his shot blocked Jaden Hastings applause said not so fast See if the guard can keep the contact with the body which Hayes does right there the second guy in can get an easy block Almost drove that through the floor cheering The next key the next step for him is to keep that in play You know get the block and uh keep that ball and get possession cheering Chance Mallerie working on Tavis And Tavis goes down but Mallerie had already passed Three on the way Its lost Long rebound And here comes Han Jr handle lost Lets see who it went off of Looks as though it went off of Boston College theyre saying And so Virginia ball Jakari Whites going to check back in for Mallerie Looks like coming in as well Yeah Rick I mean if youve you know for Earl Grant five minutes to go twopoint game Yeah Ill take that Absolutely Thats what he said Were going to compete cheering Thats exactly what Boston College has done today Thomas tries to make the hard left turn get quick to the rim hangs in the air but looks like a foul this time I think theyre going to get Hastings That could be his fourth foul I believe Sure enough Jaden Hastings fourth foul Last win against a ranked opponent look wearing the same uniform laughter So maybe we got the guy with the hat behind us Nate And yeah cheering Thomas at the line and his first one goes Thomas has started every game this year and surprisingly his first double double came two weeks ago at SMU cheering Thomas with 14 points now Hes four for four from the line Davis works Thomas across the timeline Now BC down four the 430 mark Nice little stop and jump Doesnt go for pain Yeah You see on that side of the floor thats a tough shot for a lefthander to be going right and then pull up all the way to the rim for Thomas It doesnt go and then cleared out Tavis coming up on the 4minute mark Virginia with a fourpoint advantage cheering and the steel back to Thomas He cant handle it for three No cheering but the offensive rebound stays with Virginia I tell you though on the initial break Virginia has not been very efficient converting Tillis drives to the basket kind of a no look hook there applause and well take a quick break 6460 Virginia leading Ky once again Now you dont want to throw that fifth foul away but knowing that you got a guy behind you on the bench he can still play aggressively Brun Yep applause Runs Brunos been the starter for Virginia all season long in that position Well you know thats something you talk about the 12 new faces at Virginia Theyve been very consistent in their applause in their starters their play and their rotation cheering Its a twopoint game Virginia 64 Boston College 62 is Virginia back on the offensive side cheering The drive into Hall Nice little reverse layup They wanted him to shoot the three but he does what he does very well getting into the lane Davis gets it to Fred Payne With the screen and now the three and a second three doesnt go for Chapsky Made the first one in the first half Under three minutes in a close game A little different shot than in the cheering first half Virginia up four Turn Little move by Mallalerie and it goes He was looking for the foul A lot of contact but no call DC No field goals Yeah Virginia keep shot blockers out on the perimeter The guards have been very aggressive attacking the paint Paul on defense and Payne cant drive in Theres Kowky And looks like a foul James Mallerie Well we talk about them being a big team Mallerie at 510 still the ability as a freshman to go in and and finish inside Donald you look at And that ones going to fall And Junior now with 19 points That last foul on Don Hall is his fourth personal applause So Virginia with four cheering four fouls two players Hall still on the floor cheering Grunlo sat now And Yanso back in at the big Ritter cant handle the pass And over and back Ritter kicked it back to Tavis before he crossed the timeline Well Hastings made a nice play out front and then you know you dont want your big guy He does a nice job with the deflection playing off the ball and right here you you know just not used to handling the ball in the middle of the floor So Virginia back in cheering control up four Thomas drives into the paint Hall foul This is where you know at the end of the game hes 82 from the free throw line And Hall Fred Pants third personal foul as Paul goes to the line cheering Yeah Id be shocked if cheering probably wants an air ball if that happens from him at the free throw line Yeah hes 82 free throw shooter So theyre still remembering in the first half when Hall missed the rim on a threepoint shot and hes good for both BC no field goals in over four plus minutes now This is this has been their issue Theyve had those stretches in games at the wrong time where its hurt them I mean they scoring wise and tempowise they played the way they game they you know this is how they wanted to play That three doesnt go for Boston College As far as threepoint shooting thats not their shot Matter of fact in the ACC theyre at the bottom of the list as far as threepoint shooters And Virginia is four for 23 behind the arc So I mean you thought you see that number before the game and you think were in pretty good shape Yeah Nice pass off to cheering makes that one look easy and hes up seven points Davis trapped ball tipped picked up by Han Jr and Mallerie gets his hand in on the pass and its going to stay with BC And now were seeing we got a timeout by BC An eightpoint advantage for Virginia and Boston College battle back Really mature for a freshman point guard music Chance Mallerie listed at just 510 The freshman right now on Fred Payne as they inbound the ball Not a lot of time for BC And nice little floater Kane cuts the lead to six And theres the foul You would think theyd have to go to that quickly being down six Ritter is going to go to the line And thatll do it for Jaden Hastings Five personal fouls for him will send him to the bench I mean its its been a pretty you know coming off a careerhigh its been a pretty quiet afternoon for Derritter I mean there are a lot of things that BC did well in this game They just had that 4minute drought at the very wrong time This conference has been dominated by Boozer and and a couple others as far as players of the week But I would say after what we saw out of Derritter uh four days ago he could be up for player of the week for this conference Well and yeah Okorei out in Stanford is having a terrific year Hes gotten overlooked to a degree cheering in and out Free throw for Ditter the clock Its down to 20 seconds still to play in this one Drive in no good And Chance Valerie brings it out and is going to hold on to it So a valiant effort for Boston College today A lot of Virginia supporters in the in the standoffs applause And thatll do it Virginia 73 Boston College 66 and
