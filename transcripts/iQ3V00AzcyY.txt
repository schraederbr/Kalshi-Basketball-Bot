against Miss His first game of his college career that he did not have a field goal NC State looking to get him started early McFarest wins the tip The Demon Deacons 9 and4 as we mentioned same record as the Wolfpack NC States in better shape to start the new year because of their difficult nonconference schedule Wake gets a wideopen three to start the game Its Omaha Beloo just a sixpoint per game scorer who gets a perfect look for the Deets Much to the joy of Steve Forbes to the chagrin of Will Wade who has this starting five for NC State Allan Breed makes his third consecutive start Good allaround player Paul McNeels been a redhot shooter with Quadier Copeland Van Allen Luben and the affformentioned Williams McNeel with 17 threes in the last two games including an NC State record 11 against Texas Southern This is Breed at the end of the shot clock Clanks a three and the rebound to Miles Kovven the Purdue transfer who has electrified Wake in his last four games all starts counties Kovven Harris the guards Omaha Belaloo Trayvon Spillers are the bigs and counties throws it right to Copeland NC States second leading steels man Copelan do it all point guard sets up a little runner by Brie to put the pack on the board for NC State its their transition defense theyve got to guard the threepoint line and for Wake Forest They have to keep the NC State team out of the paint When they get to the paint they set up all their scoring options with their four out one in offense First two weight shots are Beloo threes He goes one for two Williams in transition is too strong from three and Beloo has the rebound Wheres Wake offensively I think Wake is best playing up tempo This is the smallest team that Steve Forbes has coached as a head coach And when you get to higher level teams they like to press but well see with their lack of size on the perimeter And NC State has perimeter size Lets see how they handle their ball screen coverage Copelands pass was too hot to handle Led to a run out on a SLAM AND A FOUL for Miles Kovven This kid has been a oneman highlight above the rim this year And he has a chance at a threepoint play What a play by Kovven And boy did Will Wade give it to Darien Williams on this exchange right here Gets beat on a loose ball then commits the foul Not a great start after he jacks up an early three in the shot clock Coven is coming off his first career double double 20 and 12 He was maybe the bright spot and their blowout loss against Vany the 21st lost by 31 in that game And Kovvin cans a threepoint play 65 junior out of Indianapolis Makes it 62 Wake They really wanted to get Darian Williams going early NC State Copeland maybe trying to set him up there Lost the ball from his backside Turns it back over to Kovven Had Belaloo underneath Instead its a three arounded out and grabbed by Ven Allen Luben Very sloppy start for State Just too loose with the basketball Copeland into Lubet Puts it up and in Thats getting to the paint making a play off two feet And Quadier Copeland doesnt always do it the orthodox way Sometimes its looks like hes falling out of bounds or hes going to lose control But his decisionm for the Wolfpack has been consistent Nearly six assists a game among ACC leaders Catch and shoot three Thats off the mark from Kovven And heres Copeland for NC State Alan Reed the transfer from Mcnese came over with Will Wade He draws a foul against Coven Introducing our officials Lee Cassell Kip Kissinger Justin Porterfield on Wake Forest First foul Alan Breeds not going to do anything thats flashy He has a low usage So when you watch him play hes an excellent cutter He defends their schemes well He plays with good energy but theres a lot of other guys that need the basketball in their hands And Breed just does what the defense gives him Doesnt force anything like this right here Wide open three Missed it Just saw Darien Williams check out of the game for Mus Sier And Will Wade turned his back when Williams was coming off the floor Kovvin hes got the target early Miles Kovven with six of Wake Forest nine One of the things Steve Forbes told us before the game is they had to make open shots Well theyve made them so far and their defense has generated some opportunities as well to give them the lead A much much much improved threepoint shooting team Theyre one of the worst in the nation last year Copeland against Covenats it too strong Offensive rebound for Luben and he is fouled really the one offensive rebounder on the floor many times for NC State Luben but were seeing Luben and Sier the two bigs together early Debbie That was an effective pairing to win over Old Miss One of the things that will Wade told us before the game back in his coachs office is you need six to eight minutes out of these guys on the glass being effective around the rim And because NC State switches in their mantoman those bigs are going to have to get out there and guard those threepoint shooters at Wake that you referenced Well Wade first year at NC State who has certainly made some noise in press conferences in this month after Texas Southern he said Kindergartens over And team GPA is great Its wonderful Were running a daycare Were running a competitive college basketball program He hoped that his messages would be received by the intended parties Not a good start here Trey Hollerman with a third NC State turnover Get off the bench Theyre all live ball turnovers too Kevin So that allows Wake to get up the floor quickly Calm kicks it He turns it right back over Two on two Holliver to Copeland Thats a point guard who gets up for the Thunder applause Theres no one that plays with more energy thats more pesky thats more disturbing than Copeland especially on the defensive end And he can really energize this team and this crowd Cooper Schwigers on the floor Big man 13 for Wake as Calmes three rims out Lubets got the rebound into Copeland throws it away Copel has a mismatch Hes got Cal Mis on All hes got to do is Barkley him down to the block Ugly turnovers for NC State Another open three This is Juke Harris Leading scorer for Wake misses and Sons pass is too hot for Hollowan to handle Will Wades face is about football related things Debbie Anteneelli music 2024 Naymith Kurt Gaddy Award inductee and youre the white stripes or the Cindy Looper maybe of the Naymith Hall of Fame as we see this years Rock Hall of Fame inductees Im sure its going to be a great event By the way you mentioned Chubby Checker Theres a basketball connection Yes His his daughter Misty Bass played for Gail Geston course at Duke How about that Theres always a tie Wait a minute And I guess you know Joan Jet huh You know her person one of the great Orioles fans there is Yeah Also want to say of Chubby Checker uh we lost Bridget Bardau a few days ago Chubby Checker one of three people mentioned in Billy Joels We Didnt Start the Fire whos still alive Wow Heres your trivia question for the day If you can the other two out there at home McNeel you said they needed to get him a shot They finally do In the break I said I would run something for McNeel He is 17 for 29 coming into the game And from three Kevin and last year Paul McNeel made 16 threes all season Hes made 18 now counting today in the last three games Hes up 20 lbs He works harder than anyone else to get himself ready Thats just a great job on the out of bounds play to find Paul McNeel and see if you can get him hot again and hes coming off that 47point performance where he made 11 threes against Texas Southern See the one game last year where he had 20 as NC State turns it over again Uh that 120 point game was here against Wake That was the breakout game He really didnt play much in conference play the first month of conference play They brought him along slowly and Will Wade actually said early in the year Kevin Keats and his staff did a great job bringing Paul McNeel along at his pace and he broke out here against Wake Forest in a critical win in February and hes been a big scoreer ever since Well we mentioned hes up 20 lbs from last year So you didnt want to Kevin didnt want to put him in a position last year where he wouldnt succeed They just kept working and hes put the work in and hes earned his opportunity Fish three by Kovven rebounded by Belaloo whos right around his season average with an early five Part of the reason why Will Wade is playing these two bigs Sier and Luben is so that they can defensive rebound 11 to9 week Its been an ugly start 10 turnovers in the game combined and a foul against Wake Forest going to get Darien Williams back in this game after music about three and a half minutes on the bench Hell replace Trey Hollow Well he sat over there on the bench and spent some good time having conversation with Vernon Hamilton one of Will Wades assistants Its mental for Darien right now Hes just got to play Just make the next play This is a guy who Debbie was the preseason ACC player of the year Nearly led Texas Tech to the final four as Copeland scoops it in to tie the game at 11 Hes got four And every time NC State scores they can extend their pressure in this 221 And they fall back into a mantoman but this takes some time off the clock Almost took 10 seconds to get it over Akens wild pass for Coleman is taken by Williams Heres Copeland in transition Copelan has his pass deflected out of bounds See hes right at the rim with his frame and his length He needs to finish that Points four turnovers right now Yeah he does a lot of things well Sometimes I think his unselfish playmaking uh over complicates it Williams passes up a three Got a good look for Hollowman He cant convert but Sonia is fouled Mai Mason off the bench picked up a foul a few moments ago and Omaha Belaloo and Mason were both involved in the rebounding action here The fouls on Belaloo his first at less fourth Only one foul committed by NC State so far Theyve got Matt Ael the freshman in the game number three Sier with a strong drive will give it up to Williams Leaps it short Sier goes over the top and hes called for his first So NC State has started just 5 for 12 with six turnovers Wake Forest 4 for 11 music with five turnovers Maybe its some of the rust of the holiday break and these teams havent played in 10 days Were going to go with that rust But then again if they had started brilliantly youd say See theyre fresh from the holiday break Exactly So we could build our own narratives Its been an ugly start 1111 cheering about 8 minutes gone by Heres a little handshake foul Williams reached in Hes picked up two Boy those music are two fouls you did not need to pick up for Darien Williams You have to guard the ball And there are times when in an isolation situation for Will Wades defense Hes got a couple of guys that have been exposed off the bounce and hes going to come right back out after just about a minute 20 of game time Deeply frustrating start for Williams Four minutes 0 for two no points two fouls I still think hes going to have some say an impact on this game Its we might not see him now with the two fouls for the rest of the half Sebastian looked to have just turned it over NC State remember cant hurt for Steve today and uh theres never a good time to lose a parent with someone close to you Particularly tough stretch now because conference play gets rolling and youre really into the thick of the season but Im glad Steve was able to get home spend some time with family and we send our thoughts to the whole Forbes gang Johnetta at home watching Were hoping shes going to recover quickly from her knee replacement Were sending our love to the Forbes family as is all of college basketball Coach Forbes one of the good guys that everybody likes Well Wade whos coaching against him today said he had talked to Steve A lot of texts a lot of calls for Steve Forbes Wonderful coach trying to get Wake Forest back to the tournament this year Theyve been seemingly so close every year Nice play there by his point guard Sebastian Aikens will strip off the knee of Breed and a turnover We dont often talk about atto defense We always reference offense but that was a really good stance right there by Steve Forbes group coming off the timeout Theyre really doing a good job of protecting underneath and not allowing NC State to the rim The 13th turnover of this game which has featured nine baskets Thats a foul against Lubet his first and NC States fourth You do not want to put this Wake Forest team in the bonus early They are an excellent free throw shooting team They make 18 a game They are 76 as a team That is terrific Another turnover right through the legs of Spillers off the inbound and then Brie turns it back Good golly Wow Three straight turnovers and a foul What is happening in this game Somethings wrong with the ball Kevin Theres got to be something wrong with the ball Good theory Thats Im sticking with that because any other theory is not good Thats two on Kovven by the way I think trying to play too fast Okay thats what happens when you get out of control of your body and youre trying to bounce the ball and youre trying to go someplace where your feet arent ready to get you there Theyre going to settle in here Covens going to stay on the floor with a two and guard Copeland Miles Kovven very important player their second leading scoreer best player in the loss to Vandy Lance Sier and Luben together the two bigs for State Copeland attacking and he gets fouled on the way up Thats six and a half on week And two shots coming for music Cadir Copelan Hugh Copelan is really good at fast to slow You see his yard up step in there and when he gets inside and he takes that last step hes got incredible balance and athleticism to hang on to that last step Well hes making his decision Free throws for Copeland 76 shooter misses the first Coming up next more ACC holiday hoops Clemson and Syracuse in the JMA Wireless Toby ACC music opener for both teams Clemson 10 and three Syracuse 9 and4 Pretty good start for Brad Brownells Clemson group despite losing pretty much everything from that five seed last year The team that lost in the first round to Will Wade McNe Brad Brownell is excellent at game planning preparing and developing his players And RJ Godfreys having a great year so far You know that one number about Clemson thats so intriguing to me NC States had five different players that have scored 20 or more Clemson doesnt have anybody thats made 20 They have great balance cheering First lead for NC State Beloo left it short on the deck Its Copeland who takes it away from Spillers Copeland crosses his way past Belaloo Missed it at the rim and knocked out of the hands of Sag and Nate Calise Calmese trying to go coast to coast Throws it into traffic Recovered Put up and a foul Juke Harris The leading scoreer for Wake Forest will have his first not first scoring opportunity but chance to get his first point at the line And thats the transition game for Steve Forbes They are pushing and coming downhill With their smaller team they minimize their lack of size by playing faster They speed the game up on the defensive end with some of their ball screen coverages And then offensively they are pushing The ball got by two NC State guys in white jerseys up the floor that time in transition NC States got to do a better job there And thats the first thing that will Wade said to us before the game Car 67 sophomore 20 point per game scorer Last year averaged six per game Hes got his first two It can take him time to get going He didnt score for nearly 13 minutes against Vandy He doesnt score for around 11 minutes here but Wake is back in front Hollerman into the 67 Harris Ael Really good shot fake Hes going to go to the line for a one and one now as Nate Cows bit on the fake The ball stays on the same side of the floor right here And because it does it allows that shot flake on a fake on a on a late closeout Really nice job by Matt Ael number 24 recruit on ESPNs rankings according to our buddy Paul Biancard applause And uh heard from Paul yesterday NC State is putting together another very strong recruiting effort next year Will Wade got Matt Ael who is the top ranked recruit NC State drilled in since Dennis Smith Jr back in 2015 and the kid from Baltimore has his first two I think Matt Abels upside is incredible Hes going to add some muscles to that frame Hes going to become a better defender over time in the schemes but he definitely can shoot it Did not score in the miss win as two but NC State stayed back on top here 1413 as Harris hits a three right after the main free throws He is unglued That is a beautiful looking shot Technique elevation all of it Copeland attacking finishes around the rim Seven for Copeland See when Q gets that deep hes got to score it He has got to put it on the glass and finish or dunk it Hes impacted every possession in some way it seems Seven points four turnovers two steals Copelands on the ground And theres an offensive foul that sent him there Thats Copeland being active Nobody talks more on defense than him Hes annoying Hes pesky Kai Mason picks up the foul Copeland came over from MCN with Will Wade They like it Debbie because they say he can translate Will Wade to other players You see the push by Mason It sure does help when youve had somebody that understands and can communicate it in the locker room so you can be a player team and not always have to be the coachs voice all the time And Will Wades talked extensively about some of the lack of leadership lack of vocal players Hes singled out Guardier Copeland though as one of the guys who is leading is being vocal Sets up McNeel off a screen Banks it in from straight away The second three for Paul McNeel What a great job off the top of the floor Good screening action and putting him in an action for three And a finish by Spillers His first shot 12 and a half point per game score Copeland into the lane again Scotty Ibu who said that hard screen is in the game 12 and white for NC State Here you go Back him down Flips it for a deep three Wipe it off this time Scotty Ibubet is called for an offensive foul And see 20 31 19 for 31 Thats pretty impressive Amazing And by the way he had a careerhigh 10 rebounds in that Texas Southern game Most points by an ACC player not NC State ACC since actually an NC State player Rodney Monroe at 48 for the Wolfpack against Georgia Tech in 91 And NC State will get it back music after a foul I should have looked this up to see how many assists came from Chris Ciani because fire and ice back in the day now they could music motor Those guys were fantastic playing for NC State Im sure we can get our hardworking statisticians on that music Probably text Chris Ciano Hed give you the answer Oh yeah laughter McNeel was fouled on that rebound His first rebound of the game One and one And McNeel an 83 free throw shooter Second on the team hits the first I like the change in defense coming off the timeout by NC State They go to some quarter court half court traps pressure change it get the possession and then McNeel You got to keep the games rhythm changing all the time You cant play the same way the whole time You have to change it World lead teams typically good at that Yeah theyre really good at why situations matter so much and thats why they spend a lot of time on them Situations on both sides of the ball They put some pressure in the back court here and Wade couldnt get it across in time A 10second violation forced That is the 10th Wake Forest turnover Steve Forbs team turned it over 17 times against Vanderbilt It drove him nuts He said we had nine turnovers that basically led directly to baskets He called them atomic bombers This is a dead ball turnover Williams back on the floor after those two early fouls This is his game right here Kevin This is his game Back in ISO down Hes just short on that but thats a good call by Will Wade to try to get his guy going Defended by Spillers 640 to go first half NC State by three ACC opener for both teams Calm beloo an early five Calm drives it around Williams leaves it short Here comes Able who does not have numbers McNeel Able all alone No Wack two of seven from three Theyre top 20 threepoint team in the country on the year This is a matchup Harris ought to like right here Instead he throws it off Williams foot Matchup was with Sier 610 I just think Juke Harris can go where he wants when he wants with a ball I think hes that balanced in his game which makes him such a tough check You come with a long close out he blows by Short close out he shoots the three Thats the kind of balance and rhythm you want to have as an offensive player Steve Forb said This is my smallest team but my guards are big Coven 65 Harris 67 And theres Kovven A great feed by Spillers and a good finish for Coven whos got eight A great entry to Spillers and a good middle third ball screen activity Now they are maybe his smallest team but they are one of the most athletic teams Steve Forbes has had Sixth year at Wake Williams Catch and shoot There he goes Set up by Copeland Williams is on the board from three Calmise rebound Williams trying to push it ahead of the pack here the freshman Jaylen Cross Oh he had an opportunity instead inside to Sonia and hell take that Largest lead for NC State cheering Five straight for NC State Largest lead for the Wolfpack in this first half ACC opener the 263rd meeting all time between these schools Wake Forest answers out of the timeout Juke Harris hits his second three That is a great job by Miles Kovven getting past the second level to the paint and juke Harris in the slot Eight for Harris to lead the way Coach fouled Hell get the continuation there and shoot two NC States in the double bonus So its two shot foul either way And Sebastian Akins picks up his first NC State five for six at the line in this first half They shoot it at 76 as Copeland misses And the miss wins 16 points seven rebounds nine assists His last seven games hes averaging 17 and seven played at an allconference level in his first year in Raleigh And hes shooting 60 from the floor in those games So his decisionm is whats been impressive Whether to take the shot the assist the understanding on the floor whos got the hot hand all thats coming together for Q Copelman and Harris each with eight 16 of the 23 for Wake That pass deflected thrown away by Aikens will stay with Wake with seven to shoot music Harris to inbound it all the way across the court on the skip and Jaylen Cross was out of bounds That deep corner you have to have excellent footwork Theres 17 panels over there Its 3 3 in from the back of the threepoint line to the sideline When you hit that break your footwork has to change And thats a pass over the top He He needed to have his feet ready Maybe only playing early because Isaac Carr is out Freshman backup guard out with an ankle injury And Cross commits Wake Forest 11th turnover See their season average is 12 They are very good typically at taking care of the ball Not the last two games Copelan spinama and off the window Copeland is into double figures What an athletic play Fast to slow and then he commits a foul before the balls even inbound Hes getting too amped up right there His second foul after his fourth field goal I mean its a call from the bench as you mentioned a player that doesnt get a lot of time Its a good take by Copeland but then he just gets over aggressive and over asserts himself on that defensive music effort there And here comes Darien Williams with two fouls A brief sin on the bench for about a minute If youre putting him in for offense defense I like the strategy here like put him in for an offensive possession next But then if Im Steve Forbes Im looking at going right at him on the defensive end Well Copelands going to stay in with two fouls as well Akens misses the one and one Its who you trust Kevin It Its who you trust in these situations in the game And Will Wade has certainly tightened up his rotation of late Copeland misses Theres Juke Harris Eight points couple of rebounds and assist for Wake Its a Wake Forest team that lost by one in overtime to Michigan early in the year They had closed that out That would have been the best win in college basketball maybe anybody has this season They lost in Detroit Copeland again just a little too hot potato with it Leads to an open three missed by Harris Williams and McNeel in the corner instead Luben at the rim That is all Luben That is a rim run to the front Barrier defender and drop it in the bucket This the new largest lead for NC State Up eight with three to play in this first half Team that was really tested in the nonconference They like this slip screen right here Akens off the shot fake back out Spillers not much of a shooter Akins Harris fouled by laughter Yeah theres a team in black and a team in white out here Seth by the way he just got called for his third foul Watch the right leg kick out there from Juke Harris Will Wade was irate at Lee Cassell during the break cheering thinking it should have been an offensive foul This is a real ball dont lie situation which I think Will is saying to Lee right now as Juke misses the first two Well what do you make of that Deb Do you think Woodier landed in his landing space No he was not in his landing space He was avoiding by contesting I I think he kicked his leg out You dont see that call very often And its such an important foul cuz its Copelands third That knocks him out for the rest of the half with a team high 10 One for three for Harris Lead is at seven for NC State Trying to get Williams on a post up Look how far Trayvon Spillers pushes him off the lane McNeel for three Boy you just cant give him any space And then he gets fouled at the end of it on too late of a closeout by Spillers You think that evens it out a little bit right there I think it does I I think it does music Yeah because Paul may have landed a little bit beyond the normal landing zone with his right foot That that was a Hall of Fame promo earlier not an Oscars Uh right Thats right Thats not for a couple more months McNeel whos now been nominated for best supporting actor at the line Shes it Citrus Bowl coming up today as part of Capital One Bowl Mania Michigan Texas on ABC at 3 Eastern followed by the SRS Distribution Las Vegas Bowl Nebraska and Utah 330 Eastern over on ESPN Thats in Salt Lake City Cheit Bowl Michigan Texas The Cheit Citrus Bowl Theres a Cheeit tasting station I saw yesterday There were 10 different Cheez It flavors Still playing football Boy you got a lot more football to play I know We got the most important part coming College football playoff quarterfinal start tonight with Miami and Ohio State in the triple header tomorrow College basketball conference play ramping up Football postseason is one of the great times in the sports calendar Spillers trying to force the action and its followed up by Beloo Kevin both teams coming off the ATO go to their Iverson action NC State tries to post up Darien Williams Wake Forest gets the ball where they want the Spillers on the block What a follow by Beloo Hes got seven six point a game score and then Hollman turns it over They both ran the same action Beloo again Backto back dunks Omaha and finishes at the rim A great follow with great timing Had some foot issues last year Never really got going Been a starter this season Williams bricks a three and Belaloo cheering was in rebounding position there and took a push from Luben Thats the second on Ven Allen Luben So both teams are in real foul trouble in this first half Kevin I went back and looked at some of Darien Williams numbers from last year and NC States fans will remember this In the NCAA tournament last year Darien Williams had his best fourgame stretch of the entire season for Texas Tech 19 field goal attempts and he averaged 21 points cheering They won three of those games And thats what I think NC State fans were expecting the preseason player of the year to deliver And he just has not been able to find his rhythm He had it early in the year but if NC States going to be a team that competes that contends for the title in this league and has a chance to go deep and get wins in the NCAA tournament theyre going to need Williams Why hasnt he found his rhythm You know a lot of people will say its a casual approach to the game I think he impacts the game in a lot of ways but it doesnt look like hes doing so And I think thats what people might be frustrated with is a casual approach I think hes got more to give and hes going to have to start giving it now that theyre in conference play Gets the rebound there Itll bring the ball up with under a minute to play NC State by four First game in conference for both teams A lot of it uh is a function of the offense for him too Hes been given a lot of freedom Like right here they iso He gets to Barklay Im telling you thats his game He missed the last time he went down to the block with a fadeaway This time he powers it through the chest of Juke Harris Had a 25 lb advantage on him and has a bucket to make it 3630 A foul on the cut Its going to send Wake Forest to the line for two Trey Hollowman with his first foul So thatll terminate the shot clock and it sends Juke Harris to the line What a first half for Juke Harris How impactful has he been I mean Wake Forest runs a lot of stuff for him but hes great at the beginning of the break or hes terrific finishing the break He has so many ways that he can impact winning for Steve Forbes And hes into double figures now for the 14th consecutive game to begin the year Hes the only guy on their team that has taken more free throws than threes on the season That speaks to the balance in his game Makes eight free throws a game Right now hes five for seven there Theres only two other players that have made more than or taken more than 100 threes in 100 free throws in the ACC Luben able way short at the end of the half Cal me has one final hoist and its wide right NC State trailed early took the lead for most blue had 11 miles eight Those three 30 of the 32 for Wake NC State their leading scoreer Paul McNeel puts up a three and misses Hes got 11 Quadier Copeland 10 And Darian Williams a tough first half Did get five points late First shot was a three from Harris in the half that pingpongs its way up and over the backboard Juke Harris 11 points but shooting just two for seven And hes scored five of his 11 from the free throw line I thought Juke Harris was the best player on the floor in the first half his activity level his ability to play in multiple actions for Steve Forbes And NC State 40 of their threepoint makes on the season come off of paint touches first So when they get to the paint and spray to the threepoint line thats when theyre one of the ways they can get threes The other is that middle third ball screen action right there which is a great set for Van Allen Luben while hes on the floor 66 rebounds for Luben Copeland set him up Copelands had a wild game 10 points four assists five turnovers and three fouls as Williams rejects Spillers Great recovery Good job by Kovvin to stuff the pitch back to Williams on that transition AND THEN BREED CROSSES HIS WAY PAST BELALOO Allan Breed not much of a scorer with a pretty move for two Thats exactly what Will Wade uses to describe him Its just solid right And here hes going to pick up a foul Hes just solid in what he does Takes what the defense gives him You got to have some recovery speed right here Williams gets beat but doesnt give up on the play music And then Breed doing a really good job A little stop and go against Beloo 24y old Allen Breed sixyear senior Big injury problems in the past Has been healthy this year Heres Harris Another missed three Luben with a box out Luben grabs the rebound is seventh NC State at nine and four after one of the hardest nonconference schedules in the ACC as Co picks up his third This bigger game for Wake Forest from a resume standpoint First of all Wake Forest is in worse shape Net ranking about 20 points music lower 20 spots lower than NC State This would be a quad one game on the road Frenzy State a game thatll probably be a quad two or three at home I know were early on in that respect but its a great opportunity for Wake Forest And Frenzy State its a little less about the quad opportunity more just go get a win in whats been an inconsistent start to the year Williams they left him alone PROBABLY SHOULDNT DO THAT for a guy shooting 41 from three First double digit lead for State Missed three on the other end by Mason Heres Williams Nice back pass and Luben is blocked The recovery from Mason who missed the three Knocked it out of bounds Itll still be state ball I mean Lubens got to put that away What a feed by Williams And it is a great play by Mason to once again to not give up on the play in transition Darren Williams though Debbie doing what you said Hes impacting the game in ways other than scoring Yeah His ability to screen his cutting his spacing Copeland in the paint taking on the entire Demon Deakons front line and Cuadir Copelan will get to the line Lets check the foul here because Mason was involved and he picks up his third So he and Coven each have three early in the second half I think Will Wade is excellent in the second half of making adjustments So right away weve seen them take advantage of some personnel options on the floor right there And Luben somehow not fouled off the cut and the feed by Copeland I think Juke Harris needs to be more aggressive attacking He settled for long range threes to start the half Harris with the ball in his hands into Spillers A very quiet first half for Spillers Airballed it from in the paint Grabbed by Valoo Seven to shoot for Mason Mason slithers around to Harris An open three is too strong Heres NC State which is elite in the second half You mentioned Will Wades one of the best second half coaches Those numbers tell the story McNeel Williams three Luben fighting around Belaloo but its Harris with a board Awake badly needs a bucket Theyve been outscored 7 nothing to start the half Harris again into McNeel Harris tough two will go Hes Hes so good I mean he thats what he needs to do Get himself off the bounce penetrate that perimeter of NC States defense and make a play 13 for Juke NC States gone to a lot more ghost action here in the first half second half Williams down the lane left it short and well get a jump ball Itll be Wake Forest on the air What does that mean Ghost action for NC State Its when you look like youre coming to set a screen in the middle third but you slip out of it You dont screen So what it does is it confuses the defense that is switching in that middle shoot Thats what its designed for But when you have a a really good threepoint shooter that can sprint off that action and get their feet set and let it fly it is a beautiful action in in basketball Theyve got a couple of those NC State second best threepoint shooting team in the ACC Four guys over 40 Three in the starting lineup Hollowan coming off the bench is the fourth Theres Cooper Schwigger in a very quiet first half In fact the Wake Forest bench four players no points no field goal attempts in that first as Harris runs into traffic Really good help off the turnover Copelan throws cheering it down Thats Copelan right there making a defensive play because Duke Harris recognized Van Allen Luben asked for the clear out and Copeland was in the gap Almese No he still hasnt scored Boy Wake Forest it is hard to win when outside of your top three scorers you have two points This is just get out of the way Like they run two at Darien Williams and he makes the right read But you you got to just space the floor when hes got that mismatch on the block when he can back somebody down Mason Schwigger Theres the first field goal attempt and the first bucket off the bench for weight 610 junior from Valpo Cooper Schwagger should say Mason had a shot earlier in the half So the second field goal attempt first points Williams shot ready And Schwigger ends up with a rebound Mason drop off Harris drive denied by McNeel Gets it out of there to Belaloo And that would have been a big big make to cut it to six Instead State with the ball and slowing it down up nine I dont think NC State wants to slow it down And I think theyve played with a much faster cadence here in the quarter court in the second half Copeland into Luben GLAD COPELAND 2020 vision Graham all two sport athletes Hes got that size at 66225 Darien I could see him slot tight end maybe a little Hback I might put him in the Wildcat package I got to put him a few things Yeah put him in the wild I was thinking maybe 13 personnel but I like your wildat idea Five to shoot Williams had a great second half and Spillers got tied up there Thatll be a jump ball on the shot attempt Luca Sag came over when NC State was uh shot by Trayvon Spilers It was blocked but hit the rim on the way down still called a jump and thats not a challengeable play So its the 13th Wake turnover They trail by 11 in the ACC opener NC State being led by McNeel with 11 Copeland with 12 And Williams had a good allaround game Heres Williams right now Wraps it inside A tremendous find for Sonia That is like a timing pattern Maybe Im going to move him to quarterback now that and that was a great play off their Princeton action Well you could do a lot out of the Wildcat Sure can 13 is the lead the largest for NC State with 13 to go Final day of the 2025 calendar year First game of the 2526 ACC season Comeys kicks Schwigger passed at the three Gets tied up by Hollerman and then airballs a shot Swagger still adjusting to play at this level His incredible resume with a really good skill set Trey Hollowman three Yes First bucket and first points for Hollowan and State threatening to run away with it Spillers better watch out Breed almost picked his pocket Oh good D by Breed Good switch by Williams Spillers against Hollowan Banks it home Good recognition by Wake Forest off the scramble by NC State Ball finds the right spot on the floor NC State has outscored Wake Forest 166 in the second half Sier rips down the offensive rebound off the Breed miss He goes to work onehanded Cant finish Yeah Sier needs to come around the other side of the rim and throw that thing down Four on four for the moment Mason three They got to get him going Mai Mason Thats a fivepoint swing right there Kevin Its two points you leave at the rim for NC State And a transition triple by Wake Mason whos a transfer from Washington ninepoint per game score has really struggled season low six minutes against Vanderbilt but he was big early in the year Williams open midrange shot grabbed by Sier cut back short two misses on the possession Williams last couple buckets short can cut this to single digits again last couple shots I should say Mason inside again in the mismatch Spillers Schwigger tried to put it back cheering The offensive rebound Talmise throws it away applause 14 turnovers for Wake Williams against the point guard Cal me too strong So his last two were too short This one was way too strong Is that an overcompensation just three for 12 Calmys took it away Hes set up for three Boy they they are getting the looks and just not hitting any of them This is the right guy right here Juke driving slithers through Schwagger No he missed four shots on that possession and NC State will only need one team plus 12 in the paint plus 10 off of turnovers And Wake has put up brick after brick in the second half One for nine from three Miles Coins back on the floor first time in nine minutes But Juke Harris is not Omaha Belaloo back off the bench as well Sebastian Aens cut off NC State has defended tremendously well the last couple of games But another brick from three That one missed by Mason and its out of bounds off of Golden Copelan occupied Two guys on the offensive glass with his positioning and his length on the weak side There hes helping the ball boy or the yeah the ball boy up the off the floor Cos doing a little bit of everything Hes over there helping Will Wade coach and hes got such an active voice in the game You know most coaches will tell your team talk on defense and most teams do it the first possession coming out of a timeout but then they quit doing it Copeland never stops talking And theres theres the possession we were talking about Kevin in the break Wake Force needed to try to do something to speed the game up Bring two to the ball and see if you can get a turnover Able two to shoot Oh he got tripped up with 19 to go by Kovven Its his fourth That was one possession off the timeout defensively where Wake traps And I almost thought they got a backcourt violation And then late in the clock right here Kulvin 16 remaining on the shot clock And thats his fourth Yep He goes right back out of the game after just one minute on the floor Harris returns So fresh 20 for State They dont need that much of it Matt Ael Nice switch to the left by Matt Ael NC State has opened it up Theyve held Wake to 298 shooting Its a solid shooting Wake Forest team Not today Kevin we had Paul Biancardi in the building come over and say hello to us to halftime He coached Matt Abels father Doug at Boston College Amazing Paul who is one of our wonderful analysts our recruiting guru who was part of the team that had Matt Ael ranked as you mentioned number 24 player in last years class the first player to commit to Will Wade less than two weeks after he was announced at NC State Ws putting together another strong class for next year Theyve been in the mix for a lot of top players 15point lead for NC State right now Losing in on eight minutes to play Harris took a little bump from Copeland Four to shoot Mason rebound Sonia NC State has really done a good job guarding the threepoint line Their switching defense with high hands has forced some tough chop shots Wake has taken 25 threes 23 twos but theyve only hit five threes Luben spinning and he leaves it short Foul will go against NC State Thats the 8minute NC State obviously the last few decades Carolina and Duke have owned the state Will Wade folks at NC State hope will be the right kind of guy to put NC State back among the ACCs elite back among the nations elite Its a big job Hes got a very talented NC State team thats played very well in this second half Up 15 as Copeland ends up emerging from the frey with a ball Copeland no look to Luben and he wasnt ready for it Hit him right in the numbers down the floor Beloo ACC opener for both teams NC State which was picked fourth in the ACC preseason commits a foul here Interesting dynamic You know it very well Debbie having played here at NC State Talked to Will a little bit about this here in the triangle This is NC State territory You think music of Duke and North Carolina as you grow nationally Dukes touch a national brand North Carolina as you get into the state But this area this is NC State crazy area Theres a a lot to work with here for this program Its a proud fan base Its an active and involved fan base and Will Wade has fed right into it The toughness and the grit and the blue collar if you will about the way the Wolfpack Nation approaches stuff I mean theyre serious about winning And dont forget it were just two years removed from NC State going to the Final Four By the way the last two whistles were fouls three and four on Williams He picked them up a second apart So hes on the bench Harris has 15 now for week and the lead is 13 Dont get it mixed up with investment and people spending money and resource on making their teams and programs better NC States one of them thats done that They put more money in the program in the budget Theyve done a nice job of providing the resources that you would need to bear a championship caliber culture and a lot of teams around the ACC have done that Thats part of the reason why Will Wade has in front of him nine Q1 opportunities on the schedule Able no good a three Will signed a sixyear 1725 25 million contract to come here to NC State Given a second chance at a basketball life by Mcnes a couple of years ago after LSU fired him for alleged infractions Harris in the lane cuts the lead to 11 Hes got four straight Does Wake have another surge in them What can they do to get there Well they got to speed the game up So theyve got to be very efficient on both ends of the floor right here Got to get some turnovers They got to generate some extra possessions He got fouled Copelan And you know why youre talking about music the contract for Will Wade and the amount of years and money Hes over there wearing his credential I mean hes got his credential on on the sideline Like nobody in the building knows who he is You think security might actually stop him somewhere I dont think so There it is The yellow tag Its hanging right off the belt 17 million apparently not enough to get you to stop wearing a credential Well he said you know Im still new here and you never know New people work the building New people in security He said they told me to wear it so Im wearing it There you go Will Wade upholding the credential laws here at NC State Just following the rules Thats right Hes got a good sense of humor by the whole thing Under six to play His Wolfpack lead by 13 Hollowan Wakes really locking in right here Got to force a tough contestant too which is exactly what that was So they give up the offensive glass at the lane in the lane Moving into double figures for the 10th time in 11 games Hes been Mr Consistent This has been one of his worst shooting nights of the year Hes five for nine Yes exactly 69 among the nations leaders Hes been 80 in the second half and hes missed a few Calis collects Fumble by Mason Five to shoot Heres Harris Deep three No good Bricks out to Copelan Rolls it to Hollowan Well he certainly has a creative way to distribute Sometimes it gets there though Yeah Sier off his shoe Will Wade not a good possession there for NC State Hell not be thrilled with that But you look at the backstory Two years of ECU five LSU and then folks know had a couple of alleged NCAA infractions Look out here Able with his stuff Hes been pretty honest and open about the mistakes he made He was caught on a federal wire tap He said he owned everything According to Boo Coran athletic director when they talked about this coaching position Will has been honest about it said Ive made mistakes And he said Look this place well see if it works He told Corgan Im your best chance Youre my best chance Copeland rebound Sier hes fouled Its working today Great start to conference gravity And we just go back to the point of interruption which is Sier at the line and Sier gets the free throw to go Whats impressed you about NC State today Balance second half adjustments speeding up the game and playing more aggressively downhill Thought their spacing was better And you remember at half I said neither team was really reversing the basketball very well They were dribbling too much I thought NC State did a much better job in the second half Well theyve had some very notable defensive struggles this year in Maui They gave up 102 to Texas They got beat by Satan Hall badly Theyve been a lot better defensively of late The Old Miss win completely shut them down in the first half led by as many as 28 And then today theyve held Wake to 45 with three and a half to go Coven has not scored in the second half They just tried to bully his way And NC States defense to your point has taken Wake deep into the shot clock many times And Wake just has not been able to make a play Some of Will Wades best teams have been elite elite defensive teams He didnt know if this one could be one They still have a lot of work to do but theyve played really well against two backtoback high major teams You know what Kevin I think their uh defensive personality is starting to come to form You know I I think hes obviously hes challenged them publicly No telling how many times hes challenged them privately but they did respond in the Old Miss game and they have responded here this afternoon with a three in the other end Will told us something interesting He said We called the guys back from Christmas break on the 26th Thats pretty early So theyve had five days of practice leading into this game And thats not something he typically does with his team but he felt like this group needs more time together Look at Copeland stretch that trap His size is really tough to trap cuz he can see over the top Hollerman no for three The other thing too is shrinking the rotation a little bit and and as Kovvin gets loose on the backside shrinking the rotation playing with the two bigs with Sier and Luben I think this might be the the most minutes those two have played together all season He said he wanted six to eight that played more than that today eyeballing it Son has played 24 He averages 14 Corner three That will go Matt Ael the freshman with a deep one Hes got nine off the bench NC State needs that eighth guy And theres no problem being a freshman being the eighth guy Matt Ables played some quality minutes today Beloo with a three First career double double for Omaha Belaloo But Wake hasnt got anything out of anybody besides Belveloo Kulvin and Harris Wait trying to trap right here And this is where Copelands got to make a good choice Instead of splitting it he needs to play over the top Lou will attack Hollerman and get fouled And Will Wade giving Q Copeland a little bit of a stare down with his hands on his hips going you should know better This is where coaches start thinking about players that are playing to the scoreboard and the time on the clock and not executing efficiently every possession because Will Wayade knows and hes soon going to find out in this league You better be able to play situational basketball and better understand time and score cheering cheering Now they must get something here if a player misses two free throws in the second half right Because the crowds going absolutely bonkers cheering Is that chicken Three sandwich maybe cheering 14 points with a minute 10 to go And heres the loudest crowd of the game And they get nothing You lose Good day sir You know for Wake Forest theyre going to have to get more than Kovvin and Harris Blue emerged today if he can consistently play at that level And certainly Spillers has to be more of a threat offensively Hes certainly a great defender Theyre in a tough spot right now Wade because Luben puts a finishing touch on this one because their ACC schedule coming up these first seven games are really really difficult And before we go Kevin because weve known Steve Forbes for a long time and we can see that you know with the the loss of his mother how much its affected him and I actually think it affected his team somewhat today And so we again send our prayers out to the Wake Forest family Well said Steves mother Linda passed away the day after Christmas Can you think about the life of a college basketball coach or somebody in this game he went home for the funeral for the visitation he missed one practice you really dont have much time at all to music be with family Hes a great ingame adjuster and you can just see today hes got a heavy heart and and you dont blame him for or his team for maybe being young and and not mature at this point yet to be able to handle something like that but his staff certainly can and they have done a good job But to coach Forbs credit um you know he wished he had more time to spend with his family but uh he only missed one practice getting ready for today And he he did spend 5 days extra at Wake with his team uh pending the funeral arrangements for his mother Were thinking about all the folks in the Forest family and he is here with his Wake Forest family today They as we said have a very tough start to ACC play And well need to be better than this because Virginia Tech Miami at UNC at Florida State SMU at Duke uh thats a meat grinder in a much much improved league this year And one of the reasons its much improved is the team with the ball right now NC State led by four at the half didnt play crisp offensively but shut Wake Forest down defensively They stretched this thing out And Will Wades ACC debut as a head coach is a 13point win A big win A great second
