you and right now Tony Bennett as competitive as he is hes remembering last year mark Byington who spent time at University of Virginia two separate occasions once as a graduate manager and also as a director of basketball operations back in a different role here tonight Virginia in white JMU in purple our officials Jamie lucky Jeb Hartness and Justin Porterfield we are underway in Charlottesville and its Reese Speakman who slides in there and earns the opening possession Applause Virginia the same starting five that theyve used all season long a 70 start to this season but a little bit of a banged up backcourt with Beekman and Clark now feeling a hundred percent Franklin fires and connects to open the scoring from three and thats the way you feel better Im on Franklin knocking down to three early in this game that will get the confidence going for him take a look at the James Madison starting five a team thats very deep extremely balanced Noah friedow answers with a three the transfer from South Dakota State he could shoot it you have to be aware of the Dukes shooting the three shooting 42 percent right behind Virginia on the season nationally from Beyond a threepoint Arc think about that Corey how often do we get twoteam shooting above 40 percent from three well you say we you mean you because I get it all the time on the ACC at least the start this season theres a lot of teams who wish they were shooting above 40 from three yeah but Virginia right now won the best offensive teams in the country when you think about what they do but no one scores the basketball like James Madison Jaden Gardner has a lot of experience playing against James Madison played against him when he was in East Carolina and now both years at Virginia Molson he cant connect he had the two big buckets we just showed you in the matchup a year ago Applause Kihei Clark the blow by double team came in forces the turnover trying to go full court out of control thats a turnover James Madison likes to go fast its going to be tough to do against Virginia today yeah James Madison likes to go fast thats one of the things thats going to be interesting to see with Coach Byington does he want them to be a little more patient on offense simply because of how difficult its going to be for them on defense Virginia is going to make them work for 20 seconds on the shot clock do you want to squander possessions when youve got to work that hard on the other end of the floor look at those Ken Palm Temple Virginia third slowest thats exactly where they want to be James Madison in the top 20 in terms of tempo Franklin that almost dropped rattled around it didnt fall if Im on my mom Franklin I count that as a make it went in it just came back out I count that as they make doesnt bother my confidence at all heres friedel 10 on the timer James Madison has to hurry to go to the block second effort up and in off the window Justin Ahmadi muscling it in cant give him Marty a lot of credit going up against the shot Blocker in Cedric Kane did a great job on the initial possession but Martys sticking with Applause Music Applause five to shoot pull up pop Kihei Clark rattles around doesnt fall but when you get into the painted area and you shoot youre able to get your defense back no long rebounds so Virginia is still able to get his defense back in set Clark coming off a season High over the weekend against Florida State Gardner got a hand in there Here Comes Beekman into two purple jerseys up and in tough take for Maurice Beekman but thats not good Rhys Beekman down and hes already playing banged up struggling to get back down the floor hes really feeling it rolled his ankle against Michigan and then Tony Bennett told us really dealing with a hamstring now the ankles fine its the AMS the hamstring that really was plaguing him during that Florida State game and Beekman has to come out and its clearly that hamstring and thats a big loss for Virginia right now without Reese Beekman on the floor it puts so much responsibility onto Kihei Clark Isaac McNeely a very good first year player for Virginia but not the ball handler not the playmaker that you lose with Reese Beekman sitting on the bench so it puts much more pressure on kie a Clark to not only score but be a playmaker as well offer him left open doesnt make Virginia pay bounces out and a three Vado Morse fires James Madison in front and thats one of the areas where James Madison is going to try to exploit against Virginia Mark Byington told us when they played against North Carolina in Chapel Hill they did not make shots you have to make shots to beat the Wahoos Franklin through traffic heres McNeely deep three friedel Virginia gets the stop for both we told you banged up backcourt Kihei Clark Reese Speakman both not 100 they both started the game gave it to go Beekman now down the tunnel for Virginia well try and get an update on him as soon as we can right now this is where if youre Virginia you want to get the basketball into the hands of Jane Gardner allow him to be able to work softball fouls they were looking to get it to Gardner offer him commits the foul Virginia trailing by one and all eyes are on Reese Beekman out of this right now the Cavaliers playing without their junior point guard Reese Beekman heres the layup where he comes down awkwardly hes been dealing with an ankle a hamstring it just seemed Corey that he hyper extended that leg coming down too yeah the right leg and hes already been dealing with some issues and you see the concerned fans as he stayed down but difficult time for him running back down the floor its going to be something we have to keep an eye on and Virginia has a twoweek break pretty much after this game dont play again until December 17th and of course they were hoping to be able to get him through this and get him some rest ing to see how much Bruce Beekman can be a part of this contest thats a live shot of Beekman in the tunnel just well keep you updated on him but Virginia without him for now McNeely The Freshman gonna get some big minutes here offensive rebound Jaden Gardner Keeps The Possession alive and if youre gardener on that possession dont even throw it out go to work and you pass the basketball off as a whistle blows so they will not be shooting but Jayden Gardner gets offensive rebound on that possession and throws the basketball out when hes actually got it in post position right at his sweet spot for him to go to work they go right back to Gardner hands it off for Kihei Clark gonna be a lot of ball handling from zero and white hes used to it it is five years here in Virginia easy finish for Gardner it was and I like the way McNeil is getting downhill not we know hes a knock down shooter but not relying on the jump shot putting pressure on the defense by attacking and getting the painted area Applause pull up pop Bolson high arc bounces off battle for the board won by James Madison and thats where James Mass has been effective early offensive rebounding something that Virginia normally does to surrender many of but the Dukes have been great at it early in this game an empty possession a couple of good looks just couldnt knock him down Applause Gardner with space in attack mode right to the rim missed it Applause a foul on the floor you know for two teams that we showed you statistically have improved from their meeting a year ago it early in this game getting Vibes of the lack of scoring in the matchup that we we got in Harrisonburg well I believe the tempo has been you know kind of in between its been faster than what Virginia wants been slower than with with James Madison once but I think thats what were going to see in this game James mass is going to continue to push the tempo regardless as to what Virginia does and at the same time Virginias going to make the Dukes work on the defensive end of the floor turnover Dukes in a scoring drought of two minutes and 45 seconds now the biggest misconception is that Virginia played slow because of what they do defensively its simply about what they do offensively they dont push the tempo on the offensive in the floor and Rush quick shots they want to get a shot honestly with 10 seconds or under on that shot clock and still find a way to get a good look now were under 10 Clark goes to work Cedric has to shoot thats not his shot and he left it short well and again he can make that shot but thats not the shot that theyre looking for at that time but Shedrick didnt really have much opportunity with much choice on that one Applause Off the Mark Terence Edwards the Dukes are getting good looks theyve missed five in a row though well they missed five in a row but at the same time theyve gotten a number of offensive rebounds in the mid so if youre Mark buyington youre not really concerned about those shots because those are shots that are taken within the frame of your offense Clark for three and hes fouled so Kihei Clark will get three free throws the closeout for Molson a little aggressive and the man who was logged more minutes than any other player in the history of Virginia great foul shooter hes been like that through his entire Cavaliers career 82 percent for the line this season Applause this is it though full day of basketball on Saturday starts at one Eastern right here on acc Network and then you can see number 15 Duke in action taking on Maryland Eastern Shore Cameron Indoor thats 5 30 Eastern Time right here on acc Network any luck you had to read that promo because that was your fault the whole uh broadcaster Jinx no the Jay alter jinx it wasnt it had nothing to do with broadcast youre the one who said it own it thats your fault he aint missed the first one if you could ask Tony Bennett one player to shoot the foul shot especially with Reese out of the game right now who would he put to the line he would say me meeting himself the best shooter in the gym and you know theyre saying something for me to say that he would be true he would pick himself to go and be that guy to shoot the free throw but youre right it would be key really enjoyed my conversation with Tony Bennett before the game he told me he really loves playing these games against mid majors in state like James Madison because its something that when he played at Green Bay he wanted the chance to play the power five schools and a lot wouldnt schedule them but he cherished the opportunities to play and Mark Byington praised Tony Bennett for sticking to the contract this game well not this one but last years game was supposed to be played at the beginning of the 20202021 season three on two for Virginia rolls around doesnt fall and a travel gives the ball right back to Virginia but the game where James Madison a year ago beat Virginia in Harrisonburg the game was supposed to be played a year prior James Madison opened up a brand new Arena the Atlantic Union Bank Center and Virginia was supposed to go over game one yep to open the building there well of course covet happens everything changes so Tony Bennett honors the contract the following year and goes and makes the trip loses the game but Mark buyington said himself he said you know I can really appreciate Tony Bennett honoring that contract because many coaches throughout that time were using kova to get out of those deals I asked Tony Bennett why he decided to keep the game and he goes oh its just my nature how I was raised and playing at Green Bay we lived for those opportunities thats what college basketball is about it was a two for one so thats why James Madison is back at John Paul Jones Arena tonight theyre giving him a fight early in this game they havent scored in four minutes and 30 seconds and that doesnt drop another mislayup for JMU Music defensive battle is broken out James Madison the highest scoring team in the country held to eight in the opening 8 30 Jay alter Corey Alexander back with you 11 28 left Virginia 11 James Madison eight and weve talked a lot about that game a year ago in Harrisonburg but you looked up at the clock and said this is eerily similar to a year ago it absolutely is Virginia had 11 points and went 11 minutes and 26 seconds with James Madison scoring 15 unanswered points and during that stretch Virginia with the pretty much the entire second part of the first half with just 11 points on the board I believe it was kie a Clark who made a threepointer close to the halftime buzzer to give them 14 at the half which is the lowest total in a half in the Tony Bennett era at Virginia heres McNeely draws the foul whats amazing about that as you go more than 11 minutes scoreless and you only lose by three youre still very much in the game down the stretch well defense travels so defense made the trip you know 64 West 81 North that part of it wasnt a concern for Virginia it was offense that then it was offense all last year it hasnt been the case thus far this season but it has been here for both teams today James Madison comes in this game second nationally and field goal percentage at 55 percent and theyre shooting 23 percent here in the first half five seconds to shoot heres Kihei Clark on the move right down the lane scoop to the hoop great understanding by Kihei knowing he has more than enough time to get to where he wants to be and makes a big play for the whos who now have 13 points which good to get off that number 11 haunted number 11 when it comes to playing James Madison great effort to keep the possession alive that oh Morse now lets see if the Dukes can cash in to cow Molson on the Move pump fake now goes up with it uses the window and that ends a fiveminute scoring drought for James Madison and thats the guy that made the big shots a year ago for James Madison Olson doing a great job getting to his spot and being able to raise up off the glass over the first year McNeely Corner three too much on it from The Freshman Ryan Dunn bounces out to McNeely two freshmen on the floor for Tony Bennett and then the veteran Kihei Clark switches hands cant get the Finish but another smart play by Kihei taking the ball to the basket not necessarily firing away at a three simply because the shot clock running down travel Noah friedel lost his pivoted foot Reese Beekman back on the bench for Virginia and does have ice on the right hamstring and normally when you see that as the case there most likely will not be a return from Reese Beekman we dont have that officially yet but difficult to ice him up and then try to heat him up once again even at halftime to bring him back out for the second half so Tony Bennett really going to rely on these freshmen Isaac McNeely Ryan Dunn both into the game with Beacon out that was one of the things that Tony Bennett talked about pregame is that he needed to rely on those guys anyway and so just thrown into the fire just a little bit more but both are capable and able to handle this responsibility Clark step back three air ball left it way short Virginia just one of seven from three theyre shooting 42 percent from Deep on the season Applause freidal way too much on it offensive rebounds swatted Ryan Dunn hes got great length used it there picked off up ahead to Gardner swatted away great defense Xavier Brown The Freshman for James Madison did not give up on that play absolutely Xavier Brown with the hustle getting back not conceding to shore two for Jayden Gardner great hands to be able to get out and strip that basketball away but of course you wouldnt expect anything different from Xavier Brown coachs son stepping up and making a big play Cross Court pass finds Franklin Armand Franklin gets into the pay fading away gets it to go Armon Franklin he leads Virginia in scoring with five and thats where the production is going to have to come from without Reese Beekman youre going to need Franklin to be more aggressive on the offensive end points have been at a premium tonight Virginias defense dialed in heres Ryan Dunn stirring and swimming The Freshman Ryan Dunn on a wreck attack John Paul Jones Arena has come to life the Cavaliers on a 102 run much needed three doesnt fall Applause foreign steps out from three the roof might have come off if Kihei knocked down that three the fans here at jpj are into this one right now they understand that this is a big game but getting out on the break Kihei Clark one of the best at dropping dimes in Virginia finds Ryan who gets the job done foreign Dunn woke the building up and Virginia turning defense into offense a great job Dane Gardner getting in coming up with the great hands and the steal and then Ryan Dunn dunno we could see that on SportsCenter Top 10 this evening Ryan getting it done does a great job turning away after the flex and not getting the technical foul for looking at the James Madison Defender Applause Beekman went out in a little more than 16 minutes left to this first half has not returned the two freshmen McNeely and Don getting some meaningful minutes they played great defense James Madison only two points in the last nine minutes and another offensive rebound for James Madison unable to take advantage of it but as Katie Cedric comes over to block shots youre talking about one of the best shot blockers in the ACC when he comes over to block shots its a responsibility of the other four guys in white uniforms to come in and rebound the basketball and whats happening right now James Madison is getting multiple opportunities because Virginias not taking care of the defensive board once Kaden goes to block shots Applause heres Armon Franklin fading away doesnt fall Applause transition three and it goes that oh Morse exactly what the Dukes needed just one of their last 11 before that made three and Morris has the green light averaged 15 and a half points a game last year for the Dukes and thats up to 187 in conference play so he doesnt have any problem scoring the basketball then more of a balanced attack this year for the Dukes but he can fill it up when necessary shot clock down to five theyre trying to get it in the gardener finally do dispossessed the Dukes are dialed in defensively as well great job defensively coming over for the strip Edwards a three and they just keep chucking and thats what theyve done they lead the country and score with 93 points a game hey lepers not going to change just you know his spots you got to shoot the basketball if thats your character and thats what youre built the way youre built youve got to make sure you take those shots and the thing for Mark Byington is he wants him to start making some of those shots just five of 21 against this Tony Bennett defense Jane Murray the drive beautiful feed Kaden Shedrick does the rest and Cedric doesnt bring the basketball down giving James Madison an opportunity to strip it does a great job keeping it high and going with the Finish Applause Edwards drives Baseline denied Shedrick getting it done on both ends and we talk about the Improvement hes been none bigger than Kaden Cedric not only offensively but defensively as well Gardner this time in Virginia starting to feast in the post but thats really where Virginia can Flex his muscle in this game but on the interior with Gardner with Shedrick foreign Applause draws it on Kihei Clark which is key Hayes first Tony Bennett decided to go with a little small ball right now at the five to transfer from Ohio and in this game you can get away with that because James Madison isnt going to be bigger than Virginia as far as their size especially on the interior great defense by Murray recovery I should say because he was beaten to the block but did well to deny the bucket absolutely got to the rim walled up making the shot difficult Applause Vander Blaster three cant hit it long rebound falls out of bounds Keya Clark and upset with himself should have had an offensive rebound on that possession however his team holds a eightpoint lead 346 remaining tell you this Virginia has the absolute best and I mean best number one athletic trainer in the business my guy Ethan saliva if anybody can fix it Ethan can do it and thats one of the reasons why Julie knows that Reese is in great hands because uh oh going up top Shedrick does well to keep it in Franklin fires the three and hits it sarmon Franklin just like Tony Laughter Virginias second made three of the night both belong to Franklin Applause to just lead to 11 James Madison in the last 13 minutes only two made buckets friedel trying to change that and he does probably thats the second time fridell has answered with the three the first three in the game for Franklin fridell answered on the other end of the floor and does it once again foreign right here on acc Network you do not want to miss the top 10 Virginia Tech Hokies taking on Boston College ACC womens Hoops it starts six Eastern Time right here on acc Network speaking of womens Hoops of course I got to give props to Kenny Brooks in the in the Hokies the highest ranking ever but how about Virginias womens basketball program 100 under coach mock starting receive votes in the top 25 thank you Virginias got the only basketball programs in the country both men and women that are undefeated thats big time you see Virginia starting out 100 on the womens side the best start since 1991 1992 with a young lad by the name of Corey Alexander started to Grace the grounds of the University of Virginia by the way the greatest point guard to ever play at the University of Virginia was playing then and it wasnt me it was Dawn Staley I was about to say I think Don Stanley would win that game a oneonone normally I would say youre tripping but not with her she probably would have and we went at it a few times I wont tell you the results but I can tell you right now shes super special and a super special coach too shes going in to the Hall of Fame as a coach already in as they play Applause looking for backtoback national championships this season Isaac McNeely letting it Fly thats what the Freshman can do love the confidence of McNeely and that shot was a little quicker in the shot clock than Tony Bennett normally once but that means hes got a lot of trust in McNeely if hes got the green light to fire that early hes been playing Major minutes of this first half block Tony Bennett cant believe it livid on that Cavalier sideline Ill tell you what TV got moving down the sideline on that one though I havent seen him move that fast in a while ucs all the way up in the box but once the call happens Tony Bennett gets on the move quickly down the sideline having a conversation with Justin Porterfield doesnt like the call and thats going to be two or a bit of Vanderbilt Tony still upset Applause been a frustrating first half offensively for James Madison they lead the country in scoring 93 points per game held to 16 so far in this first half with not a lot of time to change it spinning his way free Terence Edwards and you see James Madison now after scores going to a little trapping full court pressure to see if they can get the basketball out of Kihei Clarks hands and not give Virginia as much time to execute on the half court and without a great ball handler Reece beakman in this game for the Cavaliers not a bad strategy and mismatched down low off ball foul fridell freidel having to defend Kane Cedric and thats one of the things with the Zone pressure oftentimes you can find this match as Virginia recognizing it trying to get the ball inside Etc to Jaden Gardner thank you pushed by Julian wooden Gardner will get two at the line he is just the master of the midrange game well hes a tough matchup because hes strong enough to play against anyone his size and overpower but quick enough for smaller guys big time score over 2 000 points in his college career Applause tomorrow and every weekday join accpm every weekday 4 PM Eastern Time right here on acc Network theyve been talking a lot of football but now its basketball season we got the balls still to come but ACC pm gonna be locked in talking Hoops absolutely should be talking Hoops all year long but I mean again maybe Im biased they got to get you on there well you know I mean the way my contracts set up I am going to make an appearance on acc PM sometime soon Applause youll be at the studio with Kelsey Riggs Carlos Boozer coming up at halftime 10 seconds on the timer Morse off balance but in perfect position to scoop it up and in offer him and thats the one mistake right there Shedrick if he just grabs that rebound in comparison to going for the block shot Gardner kick out McNeely for three at the buzzer cant connect and James Madison despite struggling offensively against his talented Virginia Defense they do a nice job to cut it to seven at the end of the half and Mark Byington meeting his guys at half court encouraging them recognizing that its tough to score in Virginia that bucket at the end was a big one for his team it is a season low 20 points to the first half for James Madison Virginia a seven point lead lets get you into the studio with Kelsey Riggs and Carlos Boozer whats her name as we start the second half James Madison came in the number one team in the country in scoring they lead the entire nation with 93 points per game only 20 tonight how do they change that in this second well make some shots they got a number of good looks in the first half but one of the things that people dont understand when you have to play defense for 20 in 25 seconds on every possession it is difficult to make shots on the other end of the floor so thats one of the things that Mark Byington was concerned about coming into this game is can his team make shots knowing that the way that they have to defend Virginia running through screens staying in the stands for 25 seconds its difficult oftentimes you go down to make threes on the other end after youve done that youre exerting so much effort to get the stop on the defensive end that it hurts your offense it makes perfect sense really good luck can this get things going wood and nothing but air and again that doesnt help your confidence it only hurts your confidence when you get a good look like that out of the halftime break and you shoot an air ball Im not sure if well see wouldnt take him many more of those threes inside to Shedrick righty hook left it short but I like it for Kane Cedric getting that look and more importantly Tony Bennett designing something to get Shedrick a look early putting the pressure on the Dukes of the half court really nice Runner down the lane off the window to Cal Molson remember he was the guy that led the upset effort a year ago in Harrisonburg for this JMU team and Molson is a guy that will not be phased by the atmosphere hes not phased by the moment hes going to continue to put pressure on Virginias defense to keep him out of the paint Kihei Clark Rises and hits Keith hay Clark delivers a three for the first three years of Kihei Clarks career he would catch that and hesitate and not know if hes supposed to shoot that basketball he knows now he has to take those shots and make those shots for Virginia to be successful no hesitation with Kia Slidell on the drive weaves right through traffic but doesnt get the finish and give Caden Shedrick a lot of credit coming over affecting that shot at the end making sure that Rydell knows that hes not quite open Clark feed Shadrick off his fingertips turnover Applause pull up pop and starting to heat up to Cal Molson back to back baskets for JMU thats the leading scorer for the Dukes and their leader when you consider a guy whos been in the moment and has made big shots for them knows what his team needs right now and is stepped up in May 2 here already in the second half the Dukes have brought it within five Applause McNeely the answer doesnt drop would love to see Isaac just take that first one not even bothering with the wonderful pullup you can see right now its time to be aggressive as long as he gets to the basket gets the foul when Armand Franklin and after making two shots early Molson has it going when you start going off the bounce and the pullup thats when youre starting to feel good about your game Music no surprise he was aggressive on the next possession getting down Hills we get a look at our guy Calvin Baker who spent time in this Arena on the other bench as you see Calvin director of Player Development for James Madison Applause but a fiveyear guard at the University of Virginia sat out his first year came in as a walkon and finished as a starter and Tony Bennetts first year at the University of Virginia yeah just caught the beginning of the Tony Bennett tenure Music it was funny talking with Tony Bennett before the game he goes can you believe this is year number 14 for me at Virginia and you look at the stats you know backbone of the program clearly defense theyre averaging 75 points per game thats the most in the 14 years hes been in Charlottesville yes but that 75 points per game is happening in November and December yeah really good teams though yeah playing very good Taylor Illinois but the difference is when you play against the ACC and the familiarities there it is always going to be different scores 62 points against Florida State on Saturday teams that know you its going to be different McNeely draws the foul on the drive I just dont say that to say that Virginias not a good offensive team because they are but its going to be much more difficult for them on the offensive end of the floor as they play the 20 conference games in comparison to playing against Baylor in Illinois even though theyre very good teams but they dont have the familiarity of playing against Tony Bennett style of play JMU has held them in check tonight only 30 points so far in this game for the Cavaliers yeah for a team that they Pride themselves to Dukes on offense 93 points per game theyve stood tall defensively to hang in this game Clark stepped back three hes on fire tonight Kihei Clark getting free and making JMU pay PA Clark has been making big shots and big plays ever since he stepped on grounds and he stepped them made two big ones here in the second half so far feels like he always gives Virginia what they need its not always scoring but with Beekman out tonight it has been it has been scoring but its also playmaking tonight with Beekman out but you see Kihei going to the step back knocking down the shot and you talk about Improvement I watch Kihei Clark playing at peach jam before he ever came to Virginia it actually was peach jam in Augusta Georgia where Tony Bennett saw him first Kihei was already committed to a school out west after winning a peace Jam Championship he decommitted and once he decommitted Tony Bennett was all over him and rightfully so now here in his fifth year at the University of Virginia has been nothing but the goods for the whos and I remember you know the story when Clark was an underclassman that Tony Bennett would tell us people thought they were crazy to take him undersized dont think hes an ACC fit and he has proven everybody wrong agreed and then some James Madison cuts it to five Morris checks out after making the foul shots and Morris limping a little bit over on the sideline hes going to go get checked out Applause another athletic trainer and of course when you play against a instate foe you said an hour earlier of course I live right in between my hometown is right in between Charlottesville and Harrisonburg both Waynesboro and Stanton Virginia my hometowns and I wouldnt say it was an hour drive you said that but I wouldnt say that you would do it in what 40 uh maybe 45 45 yeah we get 45 I know where all that was listening to the vehicle movies here yeah yeah I know the allworld authorized vehicle only stops are a long day 6481 Corridor you said growing up you actually spend a lot of time at JMU my older cousin Kenny Brooks whos the head coach for Virginia Techs womens basketball is it JMU alone so when he was playing there I spent a lot of time over there my little brothers at JMU alum although you didnt let him wear any Dukes you know hes here in the tennis tonight but I made sure he knew dont you walk in jpj with JMU gear on we got a great game and they lead the country in scoring more than 93 points a game theyve done it all season with balance scoring they got a lot of guys a lot of depth that can all score to Cal Molson leads them in scoring at 126 points per game and Corey as weve seen a 126 run here for the Dukes its Molson thats starting to take over it absolutely has been Mark Byington told us earlier today theyre not a team that runs a lot of iso stuff but at the same time when a game is going the way that it has especially in the first half where you only scored 20 points thats when your best players have to step up and start making plays takao Molson has done that here in this second half hasnt shot the basketball great only 33 from the field tonight but the second half has been his show as he has made play after play knocking down threes getting to the basket getting to the freethrow line as Molson gets the double figures yeah makes them both makes it a one possession game Molson has every made bucket in the second half for JMU eight of ten points for the Dukes Vado Morris two foul shots to pitch in Applause 10 on the timer vanderplas passing out of trouble heres Isaac McNeely miscommunication with Kihei Clark well done actually left the area so Brian Dunn was in the corner he vacated the corner cutting to the basket and so McNeely expecting for someone to be in the corner Applause just an automatic pass but no one home Bolson again trying to do it all that time trying to do too much I dont mind that shot if Im Mark buyington you get downhill you get a look in the painted area Applause its the foul and I dont mind that look if Im Tony Bennett youve got Kihei Clark putting it in Drive getting to The Rim finishing through the contact knowing exactly what his team needs you mentioned it earlier Jay Kihei Clark just makes the right play at the right time for his team Kihei Clark has every single point in the second half for Virginia nine well its been a oneonone game in the second half its been keyeo one in his motion on the other side of the camp you know so but Kia stepping up he did this against Florida State on Saturday 18 points for him stepped up big again Reese was limited only two players for Virginia in double figures on Saturday Kihei Clark Leading The Way with 18 points Jayden Gardner with 10 as Kihei continues to be aggressive on the offensive end of the floor but as a leader he recognizes exactly what his team needs at this time already up to 13 points tonight could very well end up beating that season high he said against Florida State whats Kias career high 25 25 I dont think hes getting that tonight oh dont be so surprised no sleep if he stays on this trajectory where he scored every single point in the second half then he might have a shot well the defense is designed to make you have to make individual plays okay if you look at Virginias lineup on the floor right now theres only one guy that can make individual plays ska Clark Jade Gardner can do it if he gets the basketball in His Hands On The Block but right now its about Kihei making plays for himself or his teammates he has to be the playmaker because Reese beekmans off the floor the hesitation a lot of contact no call JMU offensive foul trying to go in transition which theyve failed to do tonight and they commit their ninth turnover and thats one of the areas where these two teams differ both averaging over 15 assists a game but James Madison turns it over much more so than Virginia see McNeely getting in position absorbing the contact Virginia tipped nationally with 99 turnovers per game James Madison is only plus eight on the season assisted turnover Clark kick to the corner done rattles in and out no good but a good look for Ryan Dunn in the corner Keith Clark once again getting downhill helping out a teammate for James Madison players waiting to substitute in at the table heres Sue lay passes it off Molson through contact hell get two at the line and what youve seen from The Dukes they have stopped with you know all the threepoint shooting Mark Byington has led his team know hey we can get into the painted area on these guys as well we dont have to rely on the three and theyve done that for buckets and for free throws theyve only attempted three threes this half after shooting 15 in the first so 100 percent so we remind you terrific day of basketball this Saturday right here on acc Network you can see number 15 Duke in action 5 30 Eastern time Saturday on acc Network Music Olson hits them both he continues to accommodate in the second half hes got 12 points just because JMU does it as in a balanced fashion doesnt mean they dont have guys that can go out and get it done individually most is showing that he is one of those guys Armand Franklin back into the game for Virginia and this is where now you got to give Kihei a little bit of a break Armon Franklin has to become the focal point offensively for Virginia especially attacking the basket Applause great pass from Clark easy dunk Ben Vander class set up beautifully by Kihei damn you trying to run thats a goaltend Kaden Shedrick blocking it off the window easy call for the officials Applause no one picking up as vanderplas gets the easy dump Virginia getting beat down the floor in transition not something you see often but JMU not sitting around concerned about the fact they got scored on getting out and pushing that Tempo which theyre one of the best at in the nation fourpoint game under 13 minutes left in it the Duke styled in defensively Applause can they cash in on the other end make it a one possession game no good from three offensive rebound Edwards keeps it alive offer him trying to muscle it home and a foul called on Shedrick home fans dont like it and theyre going to actually say it was Armand Franklin on the foul not Kaden Shedrick it was Shedrick did a great job on the first one recovering getting down blocking the shot goes up vertically gets a hand on the basketball but its coming in you see Franklin on the jump no contact going back it definitely was no Franklin but when its all said and done you would much prefer to Franklin but Franklin to get that foul than Cedric Music billboard as he comes off shaking his head well now what now did I say that and let me go back and check how many fouls does Franklin have because its three ah no so I would prefer for Cedric have gotten that one then yeah Shedrick only has one so that would be two apiece right normally its Cedric in foul trouble closer to the end of the game especially in second half but a costly foul on Franklin that he didnt earn JMU missed both free throws so a little ball dont lie just a little bit entry pass kicked Music Applause thats a real question for Virginia who will step up offensively to Aid Kihei Clark in this second half with Franklin off the floor its been all Kihei The Possession answers your question right yeah just it would be Kihei yeah Kihei will step up to AKA but its been a lot of pick and roll action for Kihei with him as the primary ball handler in this possession this is the way we saw kieh Clark playing his second year where he was all ACC performer for Virginia Applause during this ACC basketball season you can get in on the fun ACC Network wants you to give you your Vantage Point use the hashtag all the devotion post it to social media and you just might see it right here on acc Network Timeout on the floor well step aside as well Tony Bennett wants to talk things over up by six goes directly to cancer research and prophetic word from Jim balbano because they have carried on forever Applause nice action out of the timeout here we go right back to the break thats why Tony Bennett called the timeout given some extra rest to a team thats dialed in defensive game Corey how the Dukes hung around well they have won the battle on the offensive glass thats been big for James Madison only seven Second Chance points but Virginia only two second chance points in this game so the advantage 11 offensive rebounds to only two for Virginia in this game and that has been a big difference for the Dukes out rebounding them in total 3120 you rarely see that on Virginias home floor mostly because your opponent their opponents missing a lot more so the opportunity for rebounds are there Applause its a battle test to James Madison team to come in unafraid they beat him a year ago 5249 Mark Byington trying to replicate that effort tonight here in Charlottesville yeah and that means a lot that gives you confidence coming into this building you know that you have a win over the scene and again its not a different team from the standpoint of the starting lineup theres a little theres more depth theres better debt but its still a lot of the same guys that youve seen McNeely with three seconds to shoot passes out of trouble Clark has to shoot misses it Carter were just talking about offensive rebounds thats a huge one the rebound was impressive but nowhere near as oppressive as the save to get it to Kihei Clark back in the corner Cross Court Jaden Gardner with the effort and you want to talk about Improvement this is not a play Jayden Gardner makes a year ago but he is bought in he understands this system he understands whats required of him and he goes out and gives it to you on both ends of the floor that effort each and every time then calling for the ball now can he cash in on The Possession he won mcneilia three missed it and a great look for McNeely off a nice fine from Gardner but with a oneonone coverage I want Jayden Gardner taking that one to the rim Terence Edwards driving on Gardner the floater does not fall Garner took a bump on the knee on that possession you can see he was grimacing but didnt give up on the defensive possession continue to compete Virginia already without Reese Beekman for the rest of this game only played three minutes before coming out side Chadwick thats the handle waiting for the call and itll be James Madison ball Jamie lucky Subs yeah Jeff Hardin is right on top of that one and you can see with the direction the basketball went out of bounds it was most likely off of Cedric going off of his legs as Chase Colemans having a conversation with Jeff on the sidelines and I love the fact that Jeff hardness is having that conversation as you see the direction of the basketball going swipe down Applause and I can see that I mean that thats a bang bang play right there difficult to determine honestly if it touched Cedric last but I can live with that call Armon Franklin back into the game playing with three fouls has not scored in the second half after he led the Cavaliers with eight in the first wooden working against Gardner great defense by Jaden Gardner smothered wooded on the post say you covered Virginia a year ago Jayden Garden didnt make defensive plays like this last year he is improved by Leaps and Bounds on the defensive end of the floor his scoring isnt as high this year but his value is even greater because of the way hes defended 100 percent its a big reason why a lot of people they look at Virginia and number three they go oh huge overhaul in the off season I go no it its pretty much the same guys its just the Improvement and theyre playing a lot better together well I would say its just the same guys because you add Isaac McNeil that you add Brian Dunn to the depth that is a huge upgrade from what Virginia had a year ago and no disrespected guys but at the same time what you bring Off the Bench for Virginia right now Virginias the only team in the ACC that has six players averaging over eight points per game vanderplas is a big reason for the Improvement but McNeely and done that the youth gives them a big Punch coming off the bench 100 percent the depth of the bench huge upgrade same starting five and Virginia a sixpoint lead Moores trying to make something happen scrapping in the post its blocked as James Madison is looking for a call Virginias grabbing the basketball coach Byington not happy with the contact on that possession nor was Morse Virginias defense delivers again they cant cash in on the offensive end though but this is what James Madison does they forced 20 turnovers a game but unable to capitalize once again the Dukes have had their opportunities defensively getting the turnovers and the offensive rebound and just unable to capitalize back door closed off by Noah friedel friedel pull up three fouled in transition Gardner stuck a hand in there in friedel leaned right into it well the problem with that is Gardners on Fidels left side Fidel is a righthand shooter so if you go to try to get the basketball youve got to go through the body great job by fridell selling it but any official is going to call that one transfer from South Dakota state with an opportunity to make it a one possession game is South Dakota state is that the jackrabbits it is it is always been a fan of the jackrabbits well they like to shoot the threes and theyve got one of the best nicknames in the game one possession game Virginia has not made a field goal in the last four minutes and 24 seconds theyve missed their last six shots and give the Dukes credit defensively Mark Byington going with the full court pressure once again to get the basketball out of the hands of Kia Clark theyre going to trap him make him give it up and then as he picks up the foul both teams are in the bonus the rest of the way so shooting on the foul for the next eight minutes and 41 seconds and thats what you dont want to have fouling 60 feet away from the basket and putting one of the better freethrow shooters in the ACC on the line to put points on the board without having to work missed the front end of the one and one sulay wasnt ready for it great pass from Molson and alonsolay just wasnt looking it was a great design the execution of it the pass was on point and for solay thats one you got to bring in especially in a tight game like this youve got to be able to finish that could end up being a five points wing with the three here for the hoops Applause quiet second after um Arman Franklin gives it up to Kihei Clark Five Seconds of shoot Vander Plass left wide open punched out Gardner hello I thought I got a look hell stand up and shoot it if you let him beautiful baby look at that did you see the rotation on that to follow through hes still got it give me a look let me get one of these in here Music s your replay yeah I wasnt going to die for it not diving for the ball but I tried to box but when I get my hands on it you get an opportunity to show off the forms quick release too you went right to right to form yeah I mean you know that was Curtis Staples he was with the quick release but I taught him that Applause Bolson for the tie he buries it to Kyle Molson ties it at 42 and Moulton made the big shots a year ago hes made the big shots here in the second half for the Dukes right back Jaden Gardner answers on the other end Molson this time for the lead cant connect but another offensive rebound thats now 12 offensive boards for the Dukes sulay got vanderplas in the air kick out three doesnt drop and right now if youre Virginia in a half court set you may want to give Jaden Gardner another opportunity call Gardners number on this possession as hes trying to direct traffic letting them know get me to back hes got a mismatch with Fidel Garden he wants it barking orders at Kihei Clark finally get it into him five on the timer shoots and scores nothing but the bottom of the net from Jaden Gardner back to back baskets Im UVA educated but forgive my grammar thats what he do give him the basketball down the stretch called for it got it and delivered and this crowd comes to life for the first time in this second half Molson right behind the back on the Freshman but a shot that was way off the mark right now everyone in the building knows where the ball should go nothing changes run the same action get the ball to number one they go to him they call his number great take foul and Jaden Gardner will get two at the line to try and make it six straight I know what youre saying Jake now I see you shaking your head you know what hes telling him Jay Arthur they cant guard me give me the rock put it in ones hands good things happen for the fifth year veterans Kihei Clark Jaden Gardner willing the Cavaliers to the finish line and with no Reese Beekman Kia Clark has had to be the playmaker and oftentimes the play finisher and you look at the 15 points for him and more importantly getting to the free throw line but its been Jaden Gardner here over the last couple possessions whos really put the Cavaliers on his back getting the job done in the post area from the midrange and now an opportunity to get it done at the freethrow line see I get it Jane wanted to get that route up yeah Jeff hardness coming over taking the basketball away I want to take that shot and a reminder Virginias been playing without their junior point card Reese Beekman suits the 1612 mark in the first half Applause Gardner leaves it short and Virginia not shooting free throws great here 7411 in the game PA Clark missed the front end of a 11 a few possessions ago theyve left some points on the board down the stretch now the offense not might not be clicking but the defense is doing what Virginia has built its programs backbone on the Dukes in the second half four of 18 theyve made just one of their last 10 for second in division one over 50 percent from the field tonight under 30 percent five seconds to shoot Friday now great block excellent defense by the Cavaliers Brian Dunn stepping it up on a defensive end of the floor coming up with the blocked shot and Im pretty positive Tony Bennett right now is thinking were going to Gardner on this possession nine blocks the latest one from the Freshman done foul off the ball on freidel who I like the adjustment because right now Mark Byington recognizing that friedel cant guard Jaden Gardner they switch him to Ben Van de plas but knocking out smart Tony Bennett on that one and theyll just find the mismatch to anderplas to the line and now Virginia in the double bonus so theyll get two for the remainder of Regulation five minutes left in it let me remind you tomorrow night right here on acc Network top 10 team Virginia Tech Hokies taking on Boston College at ACC womens hoops two possession game under five minutes to play here at jpj oh foul called on Franklin thats his fourth and Franklin just trying to fight around guarding Molson whos trying to catch the basketball in the post kieh Clark talking to Dunn and Franklin basically saying that matchup should have been switched it should have been done guarding Molson knowing that Franklin is in foul trouble and now he comes out of the game with four fouls scoreless in the second half agreed you thats one where you dont put Armand on the god that can and vouch over thats going to be getting the looks and also has decides to be able to post that would have been a better matchup four done Applause Bolson misses the second Applause Kihei Clark in Virginia clinging to a fivepoint lead without off the ball Gardners wreaking havoc against his James Madison defense they dont know what to do with them and you also have to remember you know this is the fifth consecutive year the Jayden gardeners played against James Madison they know him they know him well Jaden Gardner was a threetime allconference player at East Carolina Applause Virginia 10 of 16 for the foul line tonight after that Gardener make Applause battles in and doesnt drop and Virginias been splitting each and every time the one for two on their last three trip to the freethrow line now 10 for 17 on the game James Madison has not made a basket in three minutes trying to change that off from dispossessed did not get a clean look the Dukes one of their last 12 theyve missed five in a row Applause Clark in attack mode count it across the foul Kihei Clark hes up to 17 tonight and Rhys Beekman loves it Im not sure what other superlatives I can give to Kihei Clark but I will tell you that he is the heart and the soul of the hose each and every night game for The Who season High against Florida State over the weekend 18 points followed it up with a strong performance offensively tonight and having to do it because Reese Beekman is not healthy Reese Beekman played against Florida State but he wasnt healthy Kies had to take more on his shoulders because they dont have that other playmaker on the floor and hes done exactly what his team has needed them to do here tonight hes been cutting it out against Florida State trying to do that again tonight only lasted three minutes step back deep two Vado Morse and I believe hes going to review it but he called the two on the floor Applause but right now Im not mad at that I like the review and going to it immediately instead of waiting until later and thats going to be three you see Morris gets that right foot back from Beyond the beyond the line so thats going to be a three right now this is a timeout for both teams this opportunity to be over at the bench talking to your coaches Jamie lucky comes away letting everyone know that is a three so its a fourpoint game now Applause a 46 Music yeah eightpoint game coming down at the PA card Mr free throw okay James Madison string together some stops Applause see hey Clark and Jaden Gardner down the stretch for Virginia into Gardner missed it got a good look short on that one but at the same time they still killed 20 seconds on the shot clock Otto Morse just made the three and get it back to him Clark in the air Moores fires off the top of the backboard Way Off the Mark and PA Clark recovering making Morris pump fake probably would have better Rhythm if he takes a side dribble to take that three two freshmen on the floor for Tony Bennett in crunch time big minutes for Isaac McNeely and Ryan Dunn Applause five seconds to shoot Clark in attack mode down the lane draws the foul he has put so much pressure on jmus defense getting to the basket and oftentimes a year ago not just Kia Clark but Virginia as a unit was settled for long jump shots in those late shot clock situations but you see kie a Clark has his buy made up hes going to get downhill and put that pressure on the Dukes to stop him at The Rim for uh foul Shooters 82 percent on the season been excellent throughout his UVA career just five of eight from the line tonight in Virginia as a team 10 of 19 and everyone out there listening the Wahoo fans blame Jay alter he started it well kieses first free throw of the game this will be James Madison ball after two Clark misses youre gonna put this on me absolutely you started it Kihei got his first free throw you start talking about him as a free throw shooter he misses it it has been a rough night at the free throw line for Kihei its all your fault Jay alter 2 30 to go buckle up fun finish here in Charlottesville down the stretch a year ago when James Madison beat Virginia on their home floor it was to Cal Molson instead Molson passes it instead of taking the shot and its a turnover and if theres been an Achilles heel for James Madison not just tonight but this season its turnovers Mark Byington teams come comes into this game plus eight on the season 135 assists so 127 turnovers and those are not winning numbers especially when you get to the end of games when you need buckets you cant afford to have Kayla cerno turnovers combined with only shooting 25 they came in number two in the nation shooting 55 McNeely Tangled Up foul called and now hell head to the line to shoot two in Virginia now attempting dude 21st and 22nd free throws and as he offer him has fouled out of this game the Mount St Marys transfer he provides signs for this Dukes team so theyre without him for the remainder of this game but lets talk these numbers Virginia averages 194 made free throws per game right now they come into this game at this point they are 10 for 20 from the free throw line if for some reason Virginia does not win this game they know exactly where to point the finger as to why they did not win and Im not even gonna blame you Jay okay Im like wow Im not even gonna blame you a level for 22 50 in this game Applause sees an average of 74 only 50 from the line Molson Big Time bucket through contact to Cal Molson fighting to the finish for James Madison has been impressive in this second half will not be deterred does a great job avoiding the offensive foul has been Applause Hedges and then attacking Jane Gardner going through the contact the concentration to finish off the glass an opportunity for the threepoint play 16 of takal molsons 18 points have come in this second half rattles in and out no good fails to make it a one possession game Applause Music Applause 90 seconds left in regulation McNeely with eight seconds on the shot clock trying to get it to Gardner itll stay with Virginia six seconds to work with underneath their own hoop gotta mention Kihei Clark has played every minute of this game no break and you can tell when he did not run back to the top to get that basketball is starting to wear on them and the official is going to look at under two minutes in review to make sure they got this call correct as far as who gets the basketball and as you said earlier Corey this is a free time out for both benches it absolutely is and also an opportunity to rest for Kia Clark whos played every minute of this one and you see Gardner going over I do believe Virginia will maintain possession on that one Julian wooden slides in here yeah with the follow through again even if it did touch Gardner theres not enough evidence on that one to be able to overturn this I believe Virginia will maintain possession on this one team with two timeouts a minute 26 to go Virginia trying to stay undefeated number three team in the country Im sure a little revenge is on the Mind from the meeting a year ago it was before the game at this point its and all thats over its simply about winning this game Virginia came in with a tremendous amount of respect for James Madison not just because of what they did a year ago but knowing how Mark Byington has coached this team up this year how theyve improved as a unit and you can see this is a very good team they went to Chapel Hill and hung with the number one team then at the time of the country in North Carolina and theyre hanging in here making it a game with the number three team nationally with Virginia its the Dukes defense that has kept them in this game Virginia just one made bucket in the last six minutes can Mark byingtons defense get another stop here my over under coming into this game was 63 points for the Dukes at 48 I dont think theyre going to get there unless we see like four overtimes but at the same time Applause theyve done the job defensively as well against Virginia Vander Plass has to heave fading away off the back iron opportunity for James Madison trailing by four on the road they get it to Molson 16 points of this second half working on the Freshman right to the rim lays it up and in for two time out Mark Byington and with a minute left his Dukes team has made it a twopoint game Madison has held Virginia without a field goal in the last three minutes into Cal Molson has taken over this game 20 points total 18 of them in this second half and it was Molson who made the big shots for the Dukes a year ago backtoback buckets to end the game for James Madison and he has put on a show here in this second half once again showing up at the biggest moments for James Madison Applause 50 seconds left in regulation Virginia clinging to a twopoint lead Applause eight on the timer heres the Freshman Ryan Dunn skying and scoring Big Time bucket by the freshman Molson trying to answer kicks 20 seconds left in regulation Morse hes a three cant hit it Dunn had his hands on it but he dropped the ball and the officials say its James Madison ball Mark Byington uses his final timeout obviously well get a review at the mondra yeah to get a review at the monitor but I do believe that that was off of done climbs the ladder to get the rebound but unable to secure it when he comes to the ground Music but Ryan Dunn making the biggest play of the game for Virginia attacking the basket just a slight Flex on the Finish got to get back defensively and done going up for the rebound has it in his hands but loses it all on his own James Madison will maintain possession yeah its off done yeah its all done no one else touched the basketball I mean when you look at it Dunn was a foot higher than anyone else jumping for the basketball thats all him but putting the pressure on Virginia to try to get a stop here 156 remaining Music and youve got to expect from Mark buyington to go most his Direction hes been the guy thats gotten them to this point and Im sure coach Byington will ride the hot hand here looking for a bucket and again the way Virginia shots free throws in the second half you dont need to go for a three you can get mostly going downhill try to get to the basket get it quick two and then Val Virginia put him on the free throw line because at this point when you shot 11 but 22 for a game I dont care who it is that goes to the free throw line theyre going to be thinking about how poorly theyve shot free throws in this whatever you do you have to do it quickly right time is not on your side time is not on your side but youve got to find a way to get to the basket and put the pressure on the officials see if there is contact so make the call see if you can get a threepoint play the oldfashioned way clock reset to 161 Applause Music Virginia has to know its going to 15 in purple to Cal Molson whos been the only bright spot offensively for James Madison all night long and its the Freshman Ryan Dunn who guards Molson there he is to Cal Molson trying to spin his way in turnover you give Ryan Dunn a tremendous amount of credit stepping it up defensively getting the job done Music Armon Franklin checks into the game for Virginia havent seen him a lot in the second half hes been in foul trouble returns to the court with four fouls just under 10 seconds left in regulation and I love the conversation going on between Molson and Dunn no trash talk just two hoopers out there having a conversation letting done know Ill let you off the hook on that when I had you I should have shot it instead he turns it over but Dunn does the job defensively on that one love the way these two competitors getting after Applause Music into Kihei Clark whos immediately fouled Clark has struggled from the line tonight just five of ten and UC Ryan Dunn doing the job defensively recovers thats his third and gets the hand up on the right side of the body up Molson giving the impression that he is not open forcing the turnover Applause Clark has now missed five straight Virginias a team has missed six in a row from the line very uncharacteristic I blame you youve made that abundant look there tonight oh by the way I Blame You in Virginia 11 of 22 fivepoint game JMU without any timeouts remaining Morse has to go quickly and as the buzzer sounds the Dukes Miss Virginia holds on to advance to 80 Virginia survives give James Madison the tremendous amount of credit for coming into hostile territory and playing not just a good game a great game defensively against the whos offensively they couldnt get it going the way they wanted to but Mark Byington has to be proud of his teams effort and Tony Bennett has to be proud of the way Kihei Clark Jaden Gardner perform down the stretch as well as his two freshmen Ryan Dunn and Isaac McNeely an instate Rock fight Virginia wins it just heard it my ear Texas loses in overtime so maybe the Cavaliers up to number two maybe they just skip somebody and go straight to number one well find out the next time Virginia takes a quarter will be against number one Houston they stay undefeated a 5550 win lets get you into the studio with Kelsey Riggs hey Kelsey
