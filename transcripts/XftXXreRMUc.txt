Bears former AllAmerican at Stanford a twotime champ with the Lakers has a wonderful career and now were tipping and M Cal Bears will get the first Applause possession early on I would expect Cal to try and go inside its a certainly a strength of wake as defending inside I think early on theyre going to try and impose their will and Reed is big hes 71 taller than sasoko blackshire shoots the first three of the game and its three nothing Cal nice patience great way for Cal to start right there thats Reed the mentioned Applause sevenfooter Tyler Johnson runs the point Hildreth is from England he leads the conference in steals Reed Salis and Trayvon Spillers round out the top five Sal trying to get into the midrange which is so comfortable in sakovich showing his length with the block shot Soko going against the bigger read jump hook over him is good five nothing Bears really a nice post move Got Deep post position thats a big a lot of big on both sides of that P trius the All Hustle guy who played at Air Force is one of the key points for this cow bear team 31 he wont fill up your stat sheet but he is invaluable thought about taking his first shot then puts it on the flooor and loses it and now a jump ball and wake will have the arrow so Steve Forbes had a nice chat with him earlier today at the shoot around the Iowa native Five Seasons at wake after five successful Seasons at Eastern Tennesse State University where he never had a losing season no hes a fantastic coach and as we saw today a fun guy to be around and uh you know that the team has really taken on his his identity they play loose play Applause Confident its Tyler Johnson point guard and that is goal tending on Soko so count the hoop to Tyler Johnson and Wake Forest is on the board early on its uh notable that this is a physical game the ball screens are being set the guards are being physical inside a lot of contact and uh and it thats not a problem in terms of the officiating but its done the same way but both teams are going to have to bring their their work work hat today St yakovs first shot did everything but go in and Cal will keep it and in talking to coach Forbes this morning that was one of his big fears is the offensive rebounding for Cal they really crash hard they maintained possession again isoko against Applause Reed and he draws the foul on the seven footer Marty Soko will shoot to I think coach Forbes would like Reed to have just a little bit more discipline he likes the physicality but the end bailed him out you know if Soko shooting a 12 to 14t fade away probably want to live with that not put him on the line a referee in crew tonight Tommy Morrison Justin Porterfield and Kellen Milner I should say this afternoon starting to be evening on the Wake Forest part of the country keep in mind Cal leads the ACC in free throw shot and free throws made they get to the line a lot what a big reason is they put the ball on the floor they get they get to the paint and theyre aggressive going inside first and uh were seeing that so far tonight or Applause today HRI grew up playing in England and Music and we have a foul on sasoko underneath so Mar sasoko picks up his first foul you know I mentioned in the opening with Salis his his ability to score in the midrange and and hes excellent at that but with stovich on him with that length itll be interesting to see if he can get some midrange shots up without too much uh too much defense on him hes longer than you think youre right yeah and he has the hype but he also has the long arms and uh yeah hes he can be a really good Defender Johnson ran out of room now Reed turns nice move with the left both teams looking to go inside I love it theres a I think theres going to be a continued emphasis early on trying and impose their will inside not that there are small sevenfooters but Fon Reed the 7 foot 250 Pounder from Richmond is is a big sevenfooter Wilkinson the Super Sub whos now a Super Starter is on the board oh he is a fantastic scorer but he when he go left he is just lethal even though hes a small stature he can really finish above bigs since been inserted into the starting line of five games ago hes averaging 19 points a game hrip no good and stovic clears it for the Applause Bears wson again and thats not surprising hes a streaky player you know after make to see him shoot right there not surprising that was a early heat Applause check Hollis was off and its going to be the Bears ball after it goes off of Trayvon Applause Spillers with Reed weve seen him catch the ball deep post touches you know with all of this the positioning of the post play is so important deep post Touches for Reed is going to be you know in some ways an automatic two points and Wilkinson with that left hand he can get downhill and he has that little float of the high arker so it negates some of the shot blocking that Wake Forest has Spillers picks up his first foul St yakovich contested three draws nothing Johnson no good Cal has numbers five on four petritis blocked by Reed the trius is slow getting up hes getting back to this end but we have a Advantage situation for Wake Salis no Applause good rinson lost it here comes Salis and a nice finish at The Rim you know one of the phrases that coach Forbes used was strip and rip when guys put the ball on the ground ground they really get in there they get their whole body in there and they try and steal that basketball thats exactly what you saw right there it is not going to be easy for Cal to get into the paint third in the league in steals they average 73 a game know stovic hed been injured a little bit he he was back for the last game and didnt start it might take a little bit for him to get his rhythm blackshire johon blackshire the former stand out of Grand Canyon makes it an 116 Cal lead that bodess well for Cal when hes when hes getting going because they have so many other weapons as well to your point about sto yakovich coach he only played see as blackshare finishes Ill finish that thought P tridus thought about it blacker made one from there a second ago Applause now petrius against hild turns on him no Applause good Tyler Johnson uses the screen thats Wilkinson almost had it hell just spinning in and a nice finish by Cameron hildr great use of his body great back balance on the finish right there came to twoot jumping off two feet was able to have balance against the tall tall front line for Applause Cal so sto yakovich played 29 Points uh 29 minutes in his last game back had only six points but four rebounds and a couple steals so to your point coach it might take him a Applause bit get back to the comfortability of playing so Applause much really interesting with Salis right now he is settling for the threepoint shot which he is very capable of making but his best thing is driving into the paint but well see if SW yakovs length bothers him petritis no Reed just cleaning up the Applause boards def when guys get tired like this weve had a stretch of almost 8 minutes now without a whistle the last four minutes well be going to a timeout but one thing you do is settle for threepoint shots sometimes Salis got fouled so we will take a break its 118 Cal on top a big game for Wake Forest who might be on the bubble but they got the spinning hildr helping them out an indoor they play Wednesday at Duke so that flight cross country going to be a lot better for a long road trip and then theyre going to Atlanta if they have a win no absolutely and theyre very aware of whats in store for them a couple of great opportunities but also a couple tough places to play and uh theyre theyre attacking this game with an understanding this an important game to protect home court at Duke at Georgia Tech and at Stanford as Salis makes one of two and its 119 Chris tug in hes number Applause Music 22 theyre trying to get Wilkinson free off the screen but sasoko and Lead Dort now in for sasoko ran into him stovic strong to the hoop no good Dort nice Follow by Lee Dort you know one of the games within a game is is the matchups right now they have Johnson on sovich whos a little bit smaller but hes really physical and making it hard kovic to to make his cuts and get clean looks and if you havent watched Cal Lee Dort comes in and basically gives you another big strong body like Soko Solis grabbed sto yakovich with the off hand they could have called that an offensive foul they didnt and he gets the you and thats interesting because it wasnt shooting over sto yakovich he got around him used the ball screen and shot around him on that one DJ Campos like a six starter but coming off the bench with this new lineup and this wake Force defense is very good stovich no good and Juke Harris with the Applause rebound now they swing it to Johnson trying to get it back to Spillers he does Spiller short jump shot airball oh hes normally comfortable shooting from right there but that one was the wind got Applause Music it speed Applause there 2 Applause Music all right so 1311 Cal on top of wake tort some high acrobatics and hildr going the other Applause way Baseline and a nice finish thats Juke Harris with some acrobatics tied at 13 both teams came out of that timeout like a some fireworks you know coaches probably lit into them great energy on both ends finishing at The Rim right Music there now Campbell trying to get it into dor Campbells first shot of the game no good Dort has been a big presence since K you lose nothing when Soko comes out and you have Dort playing that well man the offensive rebounding is such a key part to the cow offense and great offensive rebound right there there and Cal you know they really feel that Campbells essentially a six starter they have great deal of confidence and their top six and and as you just mentioned d as well so they have depth and talent Salis hanging in and you see some of the athleticism for sure and he hes so good at getting downhill and rakovic he got to the shoulder of stovich and again its hes going to struggle if he has to shoot over stovich but hes doing a good job these last few possessions of getting to the side of Applause Music them theres Huff the steel leader in the ACC and he is tripped as he is going to the hoop I asked him about that J I said why are you so good at stealing the ball he said I I kind of see myself as a safety or defensive back and I just kind of try to read peoples eyes well he has great instincts but that was uh the problem there is Wilkinson made the a bounce pass on the perimeter and generally in the perimeter you want to make chess passes up in the air theyre a little bit faster but youre exactly right hes he sniffed it out find found the found the basketball and then gets in transition draws a foul he entered this game with 130 career steals third most in the ACC so he wears number six its an interesting story as Mark Madson looks on ha why hiler where six hes from England played soccer when he was six he got introduced the basketball they said what what number would you like to wear he thought they asked him Coach how old he was so he said Im six so they gave him number six cuz he thought you know 6 years old that was the answer so now that the league is allowed teams to wear the number 6 Seven 8 and N he switched his jersey and now he is honoring his roots by wearing number six yeah its one of the rule changes that uh it makes some sense you know there it doesnt have to be only numbers one through five and you see a lot of different numbers right now its kind of fun for the players and that kind of a story being able to uh you know take something from your past and honor it in the Applause game Tucker off the screen finds Campbell blackshire in the corner thought about it now he shoots it no good Dort bats it out to stojakovich stovich floaters short Tucker runs it down great offensive opportunities for Cal Campbells three curls out well for Wake that is a obviously its great they got a stop but that is a worst nightmare three offens or three shots with multiple offensive rebounds right there theyre going to have to do a better way of boxing out HRI buries the three heck of a stretch for him right now it all started with the energy on defense getting the steel confidence goes up from the free throw line stepped in with great confidence on that threepoint shot wake by five defensively with Reed you see him hedging hard on ball screens hes s footer like we talked about but he has great feet very very mobile for his size its a 7even nothing Cal run uh wake run excuse me D finishes and finally ends it great great find by blacker right there got to the paint help defense comes over simple play Simple dunk Lee Dort has been a spark Off the Bench for Mark Applause Madson Reed inside reverses hes got some good low post moves coach he really does and what set that up again is the positioning he caught that with two feet in the paint and he is so big at that point theres nothing you can do so its not just getting the ball in the post its the positioning in the post how close to the basket can he get it he got it deep on that one Applause Campbell ran out of real estate Dort tips it again Lee Dort is a oneman wrecking crew and he draws the foul well I dont read need to read lips but I can tell you that coach Forbes this is a singular comment when they go to this timeout find a whole introduction to the entire fan base as well not just the student athletes and the coaches but flying across the country a new conference seeing new venues new hotels the whole thing is a is a new experience which is which is great brs Air Base Horizons and uh but to be able to play in Cameron indor its a its something that all the players would love to do wake started five of 13 uh since that there four of four Lee Dort the only thing he isnt doing well is is hitting the free throw because hes been a terrific presence uh coming off the bench for Marty Soko well four offensive rebounds already for him and its the number one key to the game for Wake Forest and theyre theyre not able to do that yet so Lee Dort gets a good hand as he goes down and sits on the bench and sooko back defense defense what wake course has done well is get the ball in the paint they have 16 points in the paint compared to Cs eight Now cal goes Zone well see if Wake Forest can still look to score in the paint even against his Applause Music own Johnson the alley open Juke Harris had a good look at it but just couldnt gather it with the one hand yeah it thats one you would like ideally get the second hand on but uh if he would have caught that cocked it back if that would have been a finish that would have been something we see on Sports Centers top 10 hriff just great body control yeah thats just how you attack a Zone off the dribble or off the pass get it to the inside not much interior defense at that point for Cal brth has nine wake with a sixpoint lead thats their Applause largest now Soko back in the game tough off the screen petritis as the man up top three on the clock they have to shoot it instead the ACC steel leader gets another one with hriff pretty good offensive possession but at the end of the day the the turnover late weve talked about wake being so good with their hands getting steals got one right there Tyler Johnson looking into re cant get it to him now Salis uses a little Applause clock Salis long two no good and black sh the rebound pushing it for the Bears and with Cal theyre giving different looks to Salis weve seen three different Defenders on him right now and sometimes as an offensive player when you get out of rhythm seeing different players that can be can be effective for the defense back here no good sooko with the offensive rebound and he is fouled so coach it doesnt matter whether you have Lee Dort or Marty Soko theyre getting offensive rebounds well and Ill be honest that was a it was a great box out they had multiple guys trying to hit him and box them out but was Soko and Dort as you said theyre so big so strong theyre so determined on the offensive boards but uh needless to say theyre not going to stop now theyre going to keep going hard seven offensive rebounds for the Bears just two for Wake Cs offense has been pretty good going side to side but the whole reason youre going side to side is finding ways to get the ball going north south to the rim blackshire nice Applause crossover and the three is good by The Freshman Jeremiah rinson thats great offense and look threepoint shots when they go in are great but the reality is the quality of shot you know is determined by how you get it that was a possession where they got to the paint kicked it out easy step in Applause three Here Comes stovich strong inside and stovich with the short jumper cow within one the game within the game ST yakovich with his height you know adds benefit on both offense and defense right theres able to shoot over a shorter Defender so the game of the quickness of Wake Forest on the perimeter and the size with stovich who can watch Salis back down to Reed who reposted and goes up over the shorter Soka and right now C is deciding not to double the post with you know sakovich is looking to choke it out of there help to get it out of there but without a full double team its going to be able its going to be really hard to guard Reed for an entire game if hes getting that deep position Applause Music Applause Music stovic thought about it petrius open in the corner its good is petrius weve talked about the idea of Wilkinson and sto yakovich being such great stores weve seen blackshire now petrius make threes that really makes Cal dangerous when you have all five guys being offensive threats tied at 26 and we have a foul away from the ball I would call that a wrestling match as opposed to a foul but uh coach matsons not real happy with that one a lot of physicality we will take according to Joe lard one of the last four teams in now a cal team trying to move up the ranks and get themselves in a postseason position before for a long trip cross country to take on Duke and Georgia Tech ball goes into read the sevenfooter loses it gets it back now Salis Salis creates some room no good Soko with a rebound for Cal as long as theyre getting shots good things are happening theyre either scoring or getting offensive rebounds they just cant they have to secure the basketball be strong with the basketball and not allow any steals just like that one that was a sloppy pass that petrius almost got back but Wake Forest keeps now what Wake Forest has done is they are getting the ball inside 20 of their 26 points have been in the paint that last possession they tried to do the same thing so Cals going to have to find a way either double the post or make some adjustments so that that that stat doesnt become so lopsided H left hand no Applause good and he was out of bounds anyway after the shot so itll be cow ball and the answer were there was Soko great job going to challenge the shot I mean he elevated way up in the air altered the shot they ended up getting uh The Possession afterwards so really really good defense by K is the pace and the timing of this game what you would expect between these teams it is because theres so much at stake both teams want to win so badly but there hasnt been a real flow to the game at this point other than the one thing we can count on right now is offensive rebounds by Cal black shot it admired it and then buried it 2926 the Bears on top by three Applause Joey bracket Bracketology you got Duke as a one seed Louisville a seven Clemson an eight wake four one of the last teams in Steve Forbes aware of that the nice man from Iowa we spoke with him this morning he said he likes this team its fun hes got three returning starters in Fon Reed Cameron hildr and Hunter Salis and its a pretty fun team to watch it is a fun team to watch and you know being on the bubble its its fun that youre in the conversation but probably from here until the end of the season its a high likelihood theyll stay on that Bub and the big WIS can get him closer to being in but there is a lot of pressure involved with being there Hill dri was in a lot of trouble had to come back Applause Music out Omaha beloo is in number zero hes been pled by injuries but a good big body Off the Bench for Steve Forbes who normally coaches you point out only uses seven guys and that is a shot clock violation by wers yeah its a its a short bench generally they play really hard defensively its not a its not a team thats going to you know often score 100 points cuz theyre not playing that fast but what they do is they play efficiently offensively and then really play great half court manto man defense Campbell left alone for three DJs off Belo with a rebound good offense again inside out Applause Reed with a three Fon Reed makes only his fourth threepointer of the Season he is really having a good half on both ends of the floor hes really been good defensively in ball screen situations and now hes scoring inside and out nice steal by Johnson black Shir tried to steal it back Reed tried to call a timeout and its a jump ball possession to cow Wake Forest is so good of getting their body in the gaps getting in front of the basketball and then when theyre there its not just slapping at the ball they go in with two hands and do everything they can to rip it out of there so they dont get fouls in that situation because theres no slapping its simply grabbing the basketball and officials give you the benefit of the doubt even if there is some contact I think they would be very annoying and difficult to play against absolutely now what you are seeing is C is getting some pretty good looks from three and hitting some of them but if if they can get into the paint draw that attention to kick it out if they can hit their threepoint shots at a decent clip theyll be a tough team to beat but right now wake force is doing a great job protecting the Music paint almost didnt get the ball in but blackshire finally came to it 15 on the shot clock 50 left in the half and theres another steel coach just to your point trar Johnson spinning no good Belo got it back Salis cant get it Soko with a rebound H just steals it back lobs it up Salis tips it in what a sequence what a sequence is right great hands great activity I mean there are people flying everywhere balls going back and forth that was a fun fun 30 seconds right there wake by two shot clock not a factor its just a half clock now under nine backers got to go St yakovich has a good look and it is short and thats how the half will end 3129 Wake Forest in a frenic and fun first half of to count that somehow Soko and Lee Dort the twoheaded monster a great job on the glass specifically offensively in that first half underway in the second half mark Matson would desperately like a win here before heading east to take on Duke and Georgia Tech and then coming back to play Stanford inside Spillers who had a quiet first half scores really nice lateral screen right there a guard to big they couldnt switch it the inside presence right there again theyre going right back at The Applause Music Rim thats spillers first hoop of the game petritis no good sasoko offensive board but he brought it down low and he got tied up by Johnson out of bounds off Johnson and Cal keeps it that last 5 Seconds was just the first half Cal getting the offensive boards Wake Forest getting their hands in there try and get a steal thats what we saw a lot in the first half and its continuing now in the second Applause great active hands if you bring it down as a big its going to be hard especially against this active wake Force Team black sh and a foul called on trayard Johnson and Blacker will go to the free throw line we Forest has been so good defensively but thats a cardinal mistake you just cant foul an outside shot you know that your interior defense is so good right now that you just cant put him on the free throw line hes shooting three they say he was behind the line so black Shire will shoot three thats a problem for Cal whos so far from the free throw line just two of five we mentioned that the Bears get to the free throw line a lot coach and was not really the case in the first half yeah I think for for Cal if they can knock in some threepoint shots in this second half I think its going to be really important for their success black just goes one of three and they average over 23 free throw attempts not on Pace for that in that first half no you know in on Cs offensive end its really strength on strength their best thing is getting to the rim and wake Forces best defensive trait is keeping people out of the paint so far neither team has really been able to get any separation Reed had the good first half just so big and strong but he missed that and a nice block out by petrius he started out at 15 ft but backed his way down got a good look right Applause there wake very good at defending the three number two in the ACC it only 304 the opponent shoot the three when I asked coach Forbes I said how are you so good at protecting the paint and a threepoint line he said we just dont take any excuses find a way to get it done and theres a rip again and heres hildr ahead of everybody and with Johnson right there that is so good and its not just the fact that he got his body there and its not just reaching he grabbed it with two hands again youre going to avoid fouls get the steel I mean that is something that is drilled and taught and practice bet tritis no good and a slow dunp Follow by Mar Soko what well if youre struggling with everything else just find a way to get a shot up and go get the rebound that is a highlight finish it didnt even seem like he was near the rim when he grabbed that thing it wasnt blackshire tried to get the foul on Reed they didnt call it P tritis in the corner no good sasoko another offensive rebound and a CH ball he getting a little chippy getting a little Applause chippy W Forest as weve stressed they get two hands on the basketball they dont just reach with one turns into the fast break points both teams right now the ability to get easy baskets is going to be crucial you get easy baskets in transition and then I wouldnt even label this easy but its athletic offensive rebound it was very athletic Wing Forest is almost like those defensive backs coach and linebackers that just try for the strip every time and are effective wions effective the three is good for cow well that bows well if they can get their big to get going Wilkinson is a streaky player streaky shooter wouldnt be surprised if they go back to him tied at 35 Reed with a quick flick floater and boy is Eon Reed having a nice afternoon boy hes doing it from everywhere so effective right Applause now Wilkinson all the way and draws the foul Applause Music hey we have womens basketball for you every Sunday right here on acc Network in the ESPN app heres this weeks double headers starting with the Commonwealth clash between Virginia Tech in Virginia newon Eastern and then number three Notre Dame hosts number 21 the Cal Bears great womens basketball on Sunday Trayvon Spillers picks up his third foul thats something to watch for Steve Forbes coach Madson does such a nice job of understanding whos hot whos playing well maybe mismatches and right there with Wilkinson made a threepoint shot on the previous possession they ran some false action some false motion to be able to get the ball in his hands again drives downhill and gets to the paint thats something from a coaching perspective thats really good Omaha Balo comes back in the 68 sophomore from Dennis Iowa hes number zero for Steve Forbes Salis floating true contact and a foul will be called on Andre sto yakovich and Salis has adjusted well in in learning that is going to be hard to shoot straight over sto yakovich and he uses ball screen so well get sto yakovich on his hip and then just takes his time older players that are experienced like that they use ball screens they take their time theyre patient with how they go off that ball screen Salis is an 82 free throw sh and of course I say that he misses he looked over at you did he brame me hes one for three tonight could be my fault this one goes down I promise you hes bound to make the next six or seven huh yeah exactly twopoint game wake in front little different look with sto yakovich running the point right now a guard to guard ball screen Music and thats going to be a foul on Cameron hriff two on hildr now that last play theres nothing fancy about it but you put different positions different players in different positions you know guard to guard ball screen thrown to a big in a different spot and the defense isnt used to those things Applause Wilkinson in trouble now sto yakovich in the corner Spence Baseline tried to flip it up Solace blocked it Soko tried to dunk it and he got fouled mty is quick and explosive I mean the message if youre the Golden Bears is find a way to get a shot do not sett or do not turn the basketball over be strong with the basketball because every single time these bigs are getting the board so yakovich drives a good drive but its challenged Soko there time and time again 12 offensive rebounds for the Bears Soko the great story the former player at Michigan State who took all his nil money and gave it back to his hometown to help build a school and a well and a hospital its just really an impressive young man Tanga Foya is his hometown and Molly and hes kind of a hero there goes back and they know how much he did for his home Village since a village not a town and Ms like the mayor of the village those are the kind of stories that make it make it really fun to be able to be a part of this game salace off the glass for Wake cow was really aggressive there trying to press aggressively wake throws it over the top gets to the paint knocks it in Applause cows offense right now theyre doing a nice job a lot of screening theyre getting Ball moving from side to side these multiple actions are getting some decent shots good catch by Soko because Johnson was right there looking for the rip tied at 40 neither team can get much separation coach no this is Its its been a well played game what a shovel pass to Fon Reed who finishes great role wake force is doing a really nice job in ballc screen offense Cal runs a drop coverage mean the big is back in the paint right there and wake is getting downhill and making really good Applause decisions Wilkinson turns and fires Salis is called for the Applause foul we will take a break its a seesaw game and right now Wake forc On Top by Music two tweet 16 runs in 92 and 97 you guys had a nice Embrace at our shoot around and know you guys lived together a summer for your freshman year so history going way back yeah really cool and hes um obviously had a a great career here but to see what hes doing now um you know has a successful career up at Seattle University and yeah fun fun to see four players especially had the success hes Applause had another tie eight ties now 42 all some minor pressure by the Bears as Salis will start the offense with 15 on the shot Applause Music Applause clock into Baloo Baloo hits the jumper and hes on the scoreboard the Cal defense did what they wanted they theyre soft press took time they didnt get the basketball into about eight when you make a 15footer it negates all the good things Cal did beloo has only played in four games this is his fifth game but hes getting some minutes might have been a double Applause Music dribble now Solace thought about it we Ed some clock Applause nice defense by pus and he thought that was not a foul and Mark mson didnt think it was a foul either yeah they might have an argument there you know his length went up Salis is Crafty and creative was able to draw the foul convince the officials but on the other end Cal has to understand if you try and go oneonone without ball movement without Shifting the defense it is going to be awfully tough wake for is so good at gaping up weve seen this time and time again with a number of Applause steals Salis misses the first a reminder this is our next ACC Network gymnastics meet Sunday afternoon number 24 Clemson squares off against number 23 North Carolina at carmichel in Chapel Hill coverage begins at 400 Applause Eastern second one on the way by Hunter Salis is good so I predict that coach matsons drawing up a play right now to get the ball to multiple sides if they drive it what theyre going to do is is try and get it when the movement is happening so its not early in the offense because of all the Gap Health they see right there see the turnover story 10 points off 10 Force turnovers Lee Dort in now who had a really good first staff Off the Bench a long three by Wilkinson no good and hildr up high for the Applause rebound Im really impressed with this Wake Forest defense this is a good defensive team coach Forbes talked about it really proud of what theyre doing and the effort theyre giv Reed for three got it hes taken two today hes made two w hes been in terms of personnel hes been the the story of the game he has been really good he had made three coming into this game coach hes got two today he likes something about hos Applause Pavilion Johnson quick release no good good box out by Dort to keep reading off the glass its been a challenge for Cal to score on the half court you know I wouldnt be surprised if they speed up the game a little bit a little bit better Tempo and then continue with the offensive boards the trius got it back goes High over re no good Salis comes down with it this game has been back and forth the entire time a sixpoint lead feels like its even bigger than that but wake has a little bit of momentum right now Applause the guard to guard ball screen to get the mismatch they want right there get blacker the size right there of HRI gets in the post that was a purposeful screen guard to guard they knew theyre going to switch it and then the size of HRI they him pay Mark Matson calls a timeout hrth has four steals already that ties his career high and his offense isnt bad either wake trying to get some Music separation to this second half if Cal is going to stick with wake as theyre trying to get some separation here coach well two things I think number one is youre going to have to force something from Wake Force they wake only has three turnovers right now shooting 53 so defensively youre going to have to crack that code uh and then the offensive end I think theyre going to have to make some threepoint shots it is just so hard to get the ball inside theyre going to have to loosen everything up by making some shots Applause see if they make some on this possession is seven is on the shot clock so theyre late in that clock Wilson got Stripped by beloo Johnson up ahead of everybody blocked from behind by Campbell Here Comes sto yakovich opportunity in transition look to attack while the defense is broken down Wilkinson left alone buries the three I think Cal that might be a nice formula right there if you can get stops get steals maybe some long rebounds turn it into some fast break points that wasnt a fast break but wake never got set on that possession and an inside out three for Applause Wilkinson going right at the hoop they want a go and they will get it so a foul count the hoop and hildr will have a chance at a threepoint play so good Wake Forest has three guards that you can argue have real point guard type skills and so they can all get to the paint well take a break 5245 HRI this hoop counts alcatra a lot and its the same I go it cant be the same you were actually on alcatra he goes yeah but I felt like Id been there before the graphics keep getting better and better and better tell you Salis and wake feels like theyve been out here before the way theyre playing with composure with a big win at Stanford and then this game right now Leven Steels ties their season High which they had at copen State and at Syracuse well thats something we still have 11 minutes left from the game right Im going to bet they get another steal Hill dri is perfect from the free throw former soccer player from England Cal does not want to stop trying to penetrate but when you go in there you have be so strong with the basketball come to a twoot stop and make the play but ball security is at a premium right now for Cal and Cals only shooting 35 in the second half to your point which you told me repeatedly and youre right if they werent offensive rebounding this game would not even be close blackshire no good just takes the air out of it right now its you know theyre theyre needing a good play needing a three something and right now wake Force as confidence is growing Cal now goes back to his own defense trying to shake it up a little bit and wakes made Seven of their last nine shots a kick ball you know wake is is shooting a good field goal percentage 52 but 62 in the second half and thats why you see the Golden Bears going to his own trying to shake it up they may be going back man now trying to get wake uncomfortable a little bit off Applause Music balance I love in the shoot arounds when we were talking to coach Forbes is you know you coaches are all so died in as Johnson goes off the r what everyone else is doing he goes coach yeah were running some of the stuff you ran at Stanford like how does he know what you ran in Stanford youre right yeah we did do that I just find those conversations fascinating they pra smart if he was copying somebody that still coaching I think he I think he knew what he was doing copying from you was very good coach and will be again if you want to be five on the shot clock petrius left alone and that is fortunate for the Bears and Andre stovic right there they swarmed him had two players on him he got on balance was strong with the basketball and thats going to be a key coming forward that 11 Steels cant get to Applause 1314 quick flick good hes got a lot in the repertoire he sure does that shows great touch that free throw line jumper the 12T jumper right there is not an easy one you have to have great feel and great touch to be able to make that Campbell going against Salis Salis plays good defense he kind of long and stays in front of you Wake Forest they have pride a lot of Pride on the defensive end they play hard theyre active Campbell tough three went in and out the crowd was upset the way the tius was pushed but the balls going to go to wake petrius petrius and Hil theyre just Battlers both of them do all the intangibles fighting like crazy trying to get a possession for their Applause team HTH came close to being out of bounds when he threw it Off Pitch Riders great effort you can you can just sense from both teams right now how important this is great Energy Great concentration Spillers with another hoop and the timeout by Mark Matson and the bear as the lead has gone to Applause 12 well take a break 5947 when they started practice they talked about the defensive end first get that part right and then layer it on with the offense but Im really impressed with what theyre doing on the defensive end they have 11 points off the turnovers theyve created Cal has zero really was impressed with with Steve Forge getting it chat with him and shoot around and very impressed with how his team plays defense and theres hild with a hand on another ball theyre just everywhere hes and and Coach is a likable guy but you can tell the team likes him too they like being around him and when you have that you can really coach the guys really hard grew up in Iowa very close to Iowa City a huge Hawkeye fan um still has Iowa roots and has a connection with Bruce Pearl who he coached with auburn when he was at Tennessee and uh so a lot of Iowa ties there thats three fouls on Fon Reed had a really good game hes got 16 points and four rebounds Wake Forest gets a hand on almost every pass coach even if they dont steal it they deflect it great job by black shirt Spillers got it off the rim yeah theyre active with their feet theyre active with their hands theyre active with their bodies of getting in in Lanes its uh again its an identity and its really fun to Applause watch Johnson lost his footing now into Reed count the hoop and Reed will go to the free throw line it is hard to defend s ft and what youre seeing right now wake is doing a really nice job first of all theyre getting the stops and allowing only one shot for cow and then on the offensive end theyre taking their time theyre not looking to score in the first 10 15 seconds the shock fock is getting under 10 right now a deep post catch patience and a big finish for Reed Reed has 18 points he averages eight he has two threepointers he had three on the entire season coming in and wake doesnt play a deep bench and so you know when they can get a starter to to to really go over his average like that it adds a lot but um their starters carry a lot of the a lot of the load on the scoring because they just dont play a lot of guys Fon Reed is going to have very fond memories of the Bay Area Wilkinson for three and he is fouled by trar Johnson and Wilkinson will shoot three its one thing you havent seen today are the mental mistakes well certainly you havent seen the physical mistakes but thats two times now they fou threepoint Shooters and those are the mental mistakes you often dont see from such an elite defensive team and we have an ACC Network mens basketball double header Wednesday it starts with Stanford Georgia Tech at 7 Eastern then Cooper flag and the Blue Devils host Andre sto yakovich and Cal at Cameron indure great ACC mens basketball on on Wednesday that flight would be a lot better for the California Golden Bears if they were somehow to come back from this deficit and win this game one thing Cal has done which I like they theyve shown different defenses theyve had two or three different presses in the half court theyve had Zone theyve had man but when youre playing a team that has guards as experienced and as skilled as Wake Forest those things dont fluster them and so wake has been able to just kind of take whatevers throwing at them we see another press right now and they just they dont mind taking 10 15 seconds off the shot clock Cal has not made a field goal in over 2 and 12 minutes and theres only 6 and a half minutes left in this Music Applause game go back to Reed why not but Soko did a nice job breaking it up Wilkinson up ahead and he was fouled lets see if they call it on the floor no they call it in the active sh shooting and Jeremiah Wilkinson will shoot twoo yeah there was that that pass was up in the air instead of a bounce pass gave some time for the defense to Soko to get a deflection ends up turning into a transition opportunity for Cal get to the free throw Applause line Wilkinsons free throw is Applause good seven of eight from the free throw line tonight has 18 points so hes averaged 19 since becoming a starter and hes got 19 I expect him to be aggressive down the stretch right now hes the maybe the best on Cs team about creating a shot for himself but the lead is 10 and were closing in on 6 Applause Music Applause minutes Salis good Applause and a timeout by the Demon Deacons Salis does a nice job coach of using his off hand Salis has really been doing a nice job getting downhill and what youre seeing is laid in the shot clock every time 10 seconds Big Time shot and hes he straddles that line between hooking and holder well and he hes crafty hes been around this game for a long time and uh understands position and spacing how to use those ball screens and he has Savvy and right now Wake Forest pretty much every time down theyre getting about 10 seconds or less on the shot clock and Reed hild and Salis with 19 18 and 15 respectively thats balanced scoring by your threeheaded Applause monster coach Matson not pleased with this Wilkinson going downhill getting to the paint gets bumped pretty Music good Matson was called for a technical foul so I didnt see what he said but I did see his expression yeah he let it known he was not Applause pleased H dth one of two you know but watching the game right now you feel like wake has all the momentum they have control of everything you know with Mark Matson Im not saying that was intentional but this is a situation where he understands his team needs a spark and so well see if this can spark him get him excited fighting for their Music Applause coach that is a dangerous pass and H with Excuse me steel well as you said it was the the over under on if they were going to get another steal it certainly happened really been the key to the game really been the key to the game its been so hard to get the ball into the interior of the defense against we season High 12 steals for Music weight Salis strong move and he draws the foul and Hunter Salis will go to the free throw line and if you looked up at the shot clock again 9 seconds on the shot clock they are taking at least 20 seconds every time in a game thats double digits right now 5 minutes left its really shortening the game which is a exactly what wake wants and what Cal does not want third foul on MAR Soko and Salis who has 15 points and his three of six from the free throw line will go trying to add to his total looks like he banged up his arm just a little bit yeah there was a lot of contact when he that last foul yeah shaking his arm and uh see if he gets reboot for that second one knocks it Applause in lead is 14 for the Bears Soko double team still shoots it no good Solace with the rebound and his shoulder is hurt and hes going to need to come out of the game yeah thats really concerning obviously it bothered on the free throws he was able to make the second one but that was an instinctive Rebound with the ball above his head his shoulder extended hes wincing coming out of the game so Juke Harris comes in Music and well see if they can figure out whats going on with Hunter Applause sales we have uh another 10 seconds to talk cuz I dont think this shots going up real quick oh but a steal oh and now some words between Fon Reed and Monty sasoko and things getting a little chippy and Mark Matson runs on the court and grabs Applause sasoko well at this point theres a little bit of frustration on Cal just cant get it going on either end Coach Matson not too long ago gets the technical the team is trying to show the emotion as well but frustration as much as anything right now I thought coach did a great job there running and getting mty out of that situation absolutely you know as a head coach you can run on the court at any time defuse a situation like that as long as the assistant coaches and players dont do it its okay so hildr and Black Shear went at it and then mty and Reed went out it so it started with the contact with blackshire and hildra and sooko as you said hes coming to the defense of his teammate standing up for the for the group and um yeah emotions are starting to run Applause Music high so the foul was called to blackshire with the contact on hildr thats what sort of got people a little fired up on both sides so Cameron Hil goes to the free throw line to shoot one and Applause Music Applause Music one thats good news Salis back in absolutely and I do think Cal you know you dont have to shoot immediately but I think theyre going to be aggressive offensively trying to get a shot if they can or trying to get some kind of a decent look the first 10 seconds of a shot clock because you need possessions right now they called that a double foul so it was a foul on hildr too Applause but it was weight that was in the Applause bonus this is uh an uphill battle for Cal right now to say the least but the best way or an effective way to be able to chip weight this lead is get to the free throw line a reminder tonight at 9 Eastern the nothing but net crew will break down the day and night in the ACC with highlights and Analysis of every game and look ahead at the best matchups on the schedule for next week we got you covered all season right here on the ACC Network and the ESPN Applause app K might try and be a little bit more aggressive right now I mean a little bit deeper in their toolbox so an aggressive press that we havent seen yet but its okay as long as you can get them to shoot quickly maybe miss one get a steal nice shot by Rus petrius throwing it off of Salis it worked like a charm even though they didnt get the steal in the full court it only had 10 seconds run off the clock they get a steal once it gets to the other Applause end and thats a foul on Cameron hildr back to the free throw line last couple possessions for Cal get to the free throw line get a steal thats going to be what they have to do for another four minutes and 30 seconds so yakovich to the free throw line and expect Cal to pick up full court again a little Diamond press look to trap in the corners and try and get the steel on the pass back out and then if it gets into the full court if Wake four shoots quick you know youre youre willing to youre willing to give that up as long as its not a dead layup second free throw no good the disappointing part of that Miss free throw is not just a Miss free throw but it doesnt allow Cal to set up their Applause press and now do you think wake will spend a little more time with this shot clock no question its getting to 10 right now beautiful pass into SP but a so on out of nowhere to swat it away Wilkinson spots up to three sto yakovich offensive rebound ball on the floor comes out to blackshire sto yakovich in the Applause corner ball bounces out and itll stay with the Bears and stovich has really done a good job stovich but he just hasnt been comfortable Trying To Get Rhythm wide open shot right there hasnt been his night yet he has battled hard but hes been coming back from a hip injury and you have to wonder if hes just still out of sorts or if that injury with a shot is uh hampering him just a bit dakovic only one of 10 from the Applause field finally get it into Wilkinson whos going against Salis who despite a great offensive game has played great defense petrius draws the foul and Reedus petrius whos had a very quiet game will go to the free throw line pus has five points just two of 10 from the field they are stopping the clock which is good and if if hes able to make these free throws again now were going to expect to see that press again wake will be prepared for it but its something that Cal if they cant get the steel look to speed up the game see if they can get the shoot quickly Applause Music good try this makes both 12point gain Johnson over the timeline now hell use some clock Music as you said theyre going to delay last 10 seconds potentially a ball screen but some kind of screening action with purpose beautiful pass to who flushes it Reed with the assist what a welldesigned play coach Forbes kept that in his back pocket when they really needed to score stay with the left toel what an answer right there a quick score exactly what Cal had to Applause Music Applause daring they daring him to shoot the ball Music Applause quickly 2 minutes 35 seconds left the lead is 11 Cal needs a stop here and instead a foul on Javon blackshire Applause so what youve seen tonight coach do you think Wake Forest is a tournament team you know what its a great question and so much of the NCA tournament is analytics the net rankings and things like that but the eye test for the selection committee is real and and watching them in person right now Ive watched them a lot on tape but in person I think they have really good pieces they have an identity on the defensive end and to me they really do look like an NCA tournament team and if they keep winning like this maybe theyre not the last team in maybe theyre comfortably in its been eight years since theyve been in the eighth in the NCA tournament yeah there is an easy way to make sure youre not on the bubble thats true just keep winning your way in yeah that is true take it out of their Applause hands Wilkinson no Salis up high for the rebound and Cal is running out of time wake Force has done a nice job on the offensive end the last five minutes milking the clock getting really high quality shots late in the shot clock the other thing theyve done is they found a way to limit shots for Cal only one shot on the other end Salis wake is 16 of 21 this half theyve made only one three but they have shot the lights Applause out Wilkinson no hriff think about this 44 points in the paint for Wake they have been so good so disciplined getting the ball inside theyve shot a few threes and a few shots from the outside but they were determined to go inside against this Cal defense and their defense was terrific absolutely little of their own medicine with the steal sto yakovich lays it in Applause you got to get a steal here and you have to get a stop and even then its probably too little too late yeah theyre going to let this shot clock run down and its going to get to uh under a minute double digit lead Wake Forest has played a tremendous game on the road and to be able to get a Bay Area sweep like this really says something about their program right now got to shoot it he does and its good by Salis and how much time on the shot clock one second and that is a technical foul on trar Johnson and Coach Forbes doesnt see it but he deserved it I dont know why trar was drawn at the ref but he was drawn at him the whole time down the Applause court which is really silly at that point it is and its you know its it is about this game but youre up 15 with under a minute left but its culturally you dont want to be in the same situation where its a two or threepoint game and you make a similar mistake so thats a a teaching point and theres a lesson that has to be learned as they move down the stretch right here because as weve talked about being on the bubble you dont have the luxury of making those kind of mistakes in a close game Tyler thought he got fouled or maybe he thought Solis got fouled but Tyler was in the refs face the entire time after that made hoop you dont think you dont think they were talking about alcatra huh I I do not think they were talking about Alat Applause so what youre seeing now is a 131 just trying to kill clock for Wake Forest theyre out of their man defense trying to get Cal to take 10 15 seconds if they can St its a three 10point game wake keeps it 30 seconds Applause left against this press right now wake looks to throw over the top first uh which is good if they do that and theres some air under it it might be something that Cal can go sneak and get one Tyler Johnson gets it across and now he just going to dribble his way around till someone fouls him Mark says no foul they will not foul and an impressive win here for Wake Forest what a what a wi yeah theyll get the ball inbounded but for Wake Forest the trip home gets a lot sweeter now the resume building win for them something to be proud of they improved to 10 and three in the conference the tough Lo for Mark Matson a Bay Area sweep for Steve Forbes tough win at Stanford tough win at
