Raves about his ability to make make plays and find guys Jayden Gardner tips it back to Kihei Clark as UVA news uses a new starting lineup for the first time all season here in game 11 trying to snap a twogame losing streak Harman Franklin triggers the first shot of the night it goes begging and Jonathan beagle the big true freshman from Hudson Falls New York snares it for the Great Danes who enter 59 off a win last Tuesday at Northern Illinois our officials tonight Lee Cassell Paul sells and Jenna Renault because Betty Drew up the first play trying to get our mind Franklin going this is Gerald drumgoole the pit transfer who leads you Albany in scoring and starts by splashing a midrange jumper well hes not going to feel overwhelmed coming from pity hes accustomed to playing against Virginia hes familiar with this team as anybody good player to have if you want to come in tonight and pull off an upset you see the starting five for the Cavaliers Isaac McNeely also making his first start of the season the true freshman out of West Virginia Kihei Clark at the controls gets it to Jayden Garner and that is money from the midrings because Jerry Gardens a shot undersized power forward theres really good midrange shooting catches a shot in rhythm good slip ball screening pass there got a lot of shooting in the front line here with Gardner and vanderplas extends it Beyond three can hit that shot that time he missed everything hell hear it from the feds its hard to fill up here at jpj people did something that I would do you shoot an air ball you tell the referee was tipped to be somebody elses fault its impossible he shoots an airboat looking at your head there goes Kihei Clark dumps it down Gardner finishes four quick ones for Jaden Gardner to a good pass from Kihei Kia coming in and just hes just such a underappreciated player outside of UVA really good on ball Defender just a winner use the Cavaliers alltime leader in minutes played 27 minutes behind Mark price of Georgia Tech actually to move the top 10 in ACC history as Sergio Patel the Cornell transfer knifes toward the basket and draws the foul just comes in he lives in a paint just a great find there no look passed down to Gardner but hell help pick up the slack with Reese bigman now you all see averages five assists the game himself Music both of those guys are tied for third he gets the one hes one up his teammate now hes gonna be so possession in third place here after that assist uh Rich speaker might suit up at halftime hurry up and get back now pretty sure those two competitive guys dont have bragging rights on that there is race beakman hes been dealing with some nagging lower body injuries he seems to be in good spirits though I I think its one of those games if he had to play play but when youre dealing with soft tissues injury you know you rely so much on the players he probably told the staff he was better you know when he came back against Houston he didnt seem to move at the same Pace that he did you know when hes been healthy he moved a little better Miami so I think its just maybe a precautionary thing yeah he almost had a triple double at Miami in that twopoint loss ten Nine and Nine but getting a breather tonight as Clark draws the foul against the true freshman Marcus Jackson starting a point guard for UAlbany tonight Marcus Jackson a really good size strength and really good on ball Defender brings a level of toughness to coach killing Raves about says you know look at his stats he just plays him hes a winner I passed from Clark a little high and outside for Kaden Shedrick who is back on the floor in place of Vander plus shetrick started the first 10 games for UVA I think coach I hope Bennett would just sending a message to Cedric saying hey I need you to come out here be physical and play with the level of toughness I know you cant play with and he does his team makes his team that much better heres Patel sets it up for Jonathan beagle and thats two air balls and a couple threes for you Albany beagle another guy who cant hit from there hes made five triples in his freshman season hes gonna have to face stuff they know coming into this game theres not quite a number but they know theyre gonna they need to make threes in order to beat UVA you like to throw out a number double digit number maybe 12 or so would be the ideal number for these guys but they beagle has an advantage shooting face up jump shots just not inside against the UVA Cedric cleans up the Miss from Franklin and Caden Shedrick is on the board mention the threes for you Albany 12 is the number they hit last time out at Northern Illinois a fivepoint win into Kalb that was a season high for the Great Danes yeah they won a couple more tonight if they could its gonna be tough against his UVA defense Cedric went way upstairs for the rebound off the Miss from drum ghoul and through the foul and it looks like early on Randolph thats exactly what they want to see from 21 yeah coming in finishing offensive glass just doing the Dirty Work being physical its a great time of the year classes are our students you want your players to be pros and kind of just practice like that develop those habits and good time to challenge things I think Tony shook his lineup up as he gets ready for conference play and wants to send a message to him second foul on Marcus Jackson so he takes a seat Malik Edmund number four and black is in there Warren white Arman Franklin has it Indiana transfer playing in his 100th career Collegiate game gets it to McNeely and a nice play by Sergio Patel knocks it out of bounds with nine on the timer good reject there Baseline Drive got a block from behind but you know you press up on a guy like McNeely because most of his field goals are from the threepoint line 13 of his made 15 13 of his 15 free throws are field goals are three so you dont expect him to go buy you and drive like that but he has it in his bag Franklin with space and another slow start for Armond Franklin who was over seven at Miami only played 13 minutes in that last time out yeah hes another guy coach Bennett wants to get going he competes on the defensive end but hes trying to Rattle his cage a little bit get him going on the offensive end hes struggling from behind he I think the last possession he had a shot early didnt take if you want to see him just stay aggressive and take open shots the talented guy and when he gets going he had him and with a healthy Beekman and Kihei and just makes this Virginia team that much better talented balanced experienced 80 start trying to snap a mini twogame losing streak here foreign Music one for three from Deep this year as the shot clock goes down to five Gardner on the faceup thats too easy I think hes a guy to take a lean on a little bit more than they do just the ball in the mid post its more of a throwback theyre kind of conflicted in opening up the floor or convincing it but getting guard into the ball anywhere inside of 15 feet is always a good idea Gardners got six of the Cavaliers eight four and a half minutes in gold team has really good on ball Defenders TJ Clark lacks size he really does a good job staying in front of the basketball Applause back to Wendells three to shoot for Ed Mead from the Baseline the shot missed but Clark fouled him so Ed Mead will go to the 83 Virginia leads you Albany almost five minutes into the first half here at John Paul Jones Arena Great Danes have an ACC caliber player on their roster and Gerald drumgle their leading scorer who never scored more than six points in a game until this year now hes averaging above 14 on the season and shooting the ball well as you see hes shooting 40 from three transferred and it got injured at this first game and he can flat out shoot it theyre looking for a third consistent Shore I mean scoring hes he stepped up and averaging over 14 points a game for this team right now and Beagle The Freshman theyre raving about him as a freshman average 117 and who steps up as that third leading scorer not just tonight before the season goes a long way for you Albanese dont forget to you hey dont forget that you forget the U University at Albany yeah and their third score could be the guy who just knocked down two free throws Malik edemied whos averaging over 11 over his last seven games following a slow start to the season used to be him would have to be Daquan Davis one of those two guys got to step up consistently be that third guy conference play in the American east Cedric going to work down low missed the reverse and the Great Danes Come Away With It here is Ed meat whos a blur in the open floor he has extra Gear with him gets to anywhere he wants on the floor like that find some space and knocks down a jumper Music thats when hes in attack mode one of the reasons they bring him off the bench hes gotten to some early foul trouble but has the extra gear about him can get to his spots like that Applause Music Applause over the last seven games he said hes spot in looks like a different guy in the last month or so as said me commits the foul a little two bought in playing defense that time matched up with Armand Franklin you love the aggressiveness and they could have the unit defensive end but again its tough when you got those transfers as well takes time for guys not everybody comes through and transitions not always as smooth or as quickly as everyone would like yeah I mean came in from Mary Mack as McNeely outside the arc with under 10 to shoot for the whos deliberate as always Gardner hes feeling himself missed that one on the turnaround this is Daquan Davis had Meet Again One On One with Franklin nice backdoor cut sarju Patel whoa scooped it home great back door cut overplayed in the corner back door cut Applause Music hes looking for first layup there Sergio Patel the Cornell transfer came in playing in that Princeton offense style for the big red as Shedrick lost it out of bounds stays here Applause but Patels a guy who comes from playing for Jason Earl who actually played for Pete Carrell at Princeton so the ball movement is nothing new for him all right ball movement and body movement great back door cut if you playing the Princeton offense you definitely know how to cut he shows you there finish too Gardner picks it up finds a wide open Franklin Applause Albert Gardner has the loose change starting to just imposing his will and aside from a physicality standpoint on on drum goo he has a distinct physical Advantage get the ball inside Gardners got eight of the 10 for Virginia 45 from the field seven minutes in you Albany hanging this is Tyree Kepner Kepner with a nice move cant finish good defense from Shedrick Applause great job I should continue to move his feet how difficult to guard a big drive one way spin the other way coaches teach that because its difficult to get the different defense Franklin and thats got to feel good for him after he was over seven at Miami and started tonight over four yeah he just needs to get more aggressive I think hes a little tentative maybe lost a little bit of confidence but shouldnt be much I mean hes a theyre going to need him to take another step Applause heres Patel Kettner again working on Cedric he got himself trapped down there and walked with him great job I said just biting him up staying strong putting his chest on him forcing to travel hes answering the Bell so far I think coach tried to Rattle his cage a little bit not stardom and hes doing some good things Gardner takes a seat and the fans voiced their pleasure for his start with eight points early for Virginia Ryan Dunn takes his place the Freshman from Long Island Ryan Dunn and somebody in someone Virginia fans should know about is he physically matures and gets in his system he falls in line is that four man defensively thats going to allow them to switch and do some of the things that the the best Tony Bennett teams have been able to do at that spot wont go for Isaac McNeely you Albany will come the other way almost Midway through this first half Great Danes hanging down by three yeah you Albany wants to really attack UVA with some early drag screens that you just saw there with Evans I mean just getting him off ball Springs Applause five to shoot for you Albany Daquan Davis has to go hoist it from about 40 feet and the rebound goes to Dunn saw the athleticism is he soared for that rebound great defensive possession there by UVA you out of the pain keeping the ballroom perimeter for cing you into a difficult shot Shedrick tries it for midrange Franklin Yanks down the offensive rebound right back to the cop cant hit gotta hand on another offensive rebound but Davis comes out of the scrum I think I think its important early for UVA to take those early threepointed jump shots because the Courts shrinking Virginia up by three nine minutes in there John Paul Jones Music Wahoos catching in his sweet spot that midrange jump shot playing around the rim dumping off these are the kind of games for him where he gets to dominate if you dont have size and length and athleticism to bother his shot hes a difficult guard its a difficult player to kind of guard and I dont think the U Albany has the size to bother his shot not to be mistaken for the the you now and then yeah uba fans dont want to play the U again after theyre lost in South Beach last Tuesday what a game that was though against a Miami team thats now inside the top 20 two highlevel teams yeah just a great game great League man we dont really know who the cream of the crop is in the ACC yet ought to be decided to be going to March trying to figure that out thats Jonathan beagle the true freshman from Hudson Falls New York about 50 miles north of U albanys campus hes on the board tonight no I think he can he can score a little bit inside without checking you know Cedric on him physically I think all the other guys he has enough size and length that he can get a shot off in the post see if they go back to him without without any real true big on the floor for UVA Here Comes McNeely hard to the ten counted plus one thats something you want to see just a hard drive from him teams are going to crowd him again I said before hes close to this field goals a bit from behind the line now hes driving hanging in the air and one the threat of his ability to make shots if he plays off his shot fake I think hed get in the paint get himself going hes so much more than just to catch a shoot threepoint shooter why settle for a three when you can get a two plus the free throw its like why settle for a bodos bagel when you can go to Panera Ill get the folks from Charlottesville going yeah go get a security to get out of here seriously theres Gerald drumgoole Juan Davis a guy who can really score when he is in the groove sets it up for Trey Hutchison who knocks down a triple Ray screen slip Force guarded theyre trying to show that Nova UVA is going to hard hard hedge the screen they did a really good job of clearing out that side so Hutcherson into his three Music Applause one wont go first three to Game Time Left four teams will hold for seven headed out we need Randolph Silvers to suit up a few down thats the one thing I can still do not much else I can do the stroke never leaves New Albany started one of four ever since their four of six to take one Davis side swing against Kihei Clark the step back jumper thats pure from three Great Danes in front by Davis hes a sport hes a streaky shooter hes one of those guys if he gets going look out I mean he can score it on anybody scored him 32 at St Joes earlier this year hasnt scored above 14 in any other game speaking of Shooters Vander plas teed one up but missed it beagle with the rebound for you Albany yeah theyre looking for a drag swing here to get going yeah theyre really gonna try to use that drag screen either throw it inside or get the guards attacking off beagle tapped it out to no one tried to find Davis going the other way third turnover for you Albany Duke Davis is just so streaky hes a guy he can get to his spots but nice step Factory there streaky guy just up and down right now coach wants to give him a ton of confidence knows he needs to get Davis boy Edmonds one of those guys got to get going now theyre changing it back into two three Zone theyre going to change defenses change Pace theyll press a little bit fall back try to keep UVA off no just off guard trying to make some adjustments Clark probes gets it to Gardner working oneonone against the Freshman Beagle a lot of contact no whistle and thats you Albany ball against vanderplas his second so vanderplas who started for the first time this year has two fouls and Tony Bennett never plays guys with two fouls in the first half 002 foul participation over on Ken bomb I dont think hes concerned about the game getting away from him no reason to risk the third foul so Applause Music sometimes you dont get back into the second half case in point Franklin at Miami played 13 minutes total Davis with a nice little teardrop and he can get going in a hurry Tony Bennett wants a timeout an 80 run for you Albany and the Great Danes come in here and surprise the Cavs to start Take the Lead here in Charlottesville theyre knocking down some triples theyre attacking the basket Daquan Davis with a pretty step back they made four field goals in a row and this was the one that led to the timeout by Tony Bennett yeah you can tell Tony Bennett was upset with that Kihei clock in that middle ball screen he was weak in the defense Cedric wasnt there he was playing as if they was going to come off he aint seen enough in this full consecutive baskets hes like hey get over here and this is something UVA has been prone to theyve had scoring droughts theyve missed field goals theyre only one of their last seven made field goals and I asked Tony that today a shoot around and he says Hey When we struggle to sports I struggle to make shots we got to defend it we got to double down on the defensive end and when they made that last defensive theres a difference in teams making shots and you making mistakes to help him make shots he call the time all to kind of settle this guys down Franklin has some space takes advantage Android Applause no hesitation there defendant was up behind the screen just just shoot it you know going back to what coach Bennett told us about letting the defense lead to offense as drum ghoul tease one up and misses I mean thats such a classic coach answer but its really true with UVA right I mean its a program built on the defensive side they all know if you dont play for Tony Bennett you dont defend you wont play and thats just stapling on this program Franklin lost it hustle CC Dwayne killings at the top slapping the floor and that is a jump ball and it belongs to you Albany Music the good thing about is if you do get a turnover you want to be able to set your defense and Dwayne killings looks like he could still play some get down on the deck imploring his team to do the same for that loose ball came to you Albany after three years as an associate head coach and Marquette under Steve wojciechowski he is hes a hes a dookie as we all know oh yeah thats where the floor slapping comes yeah yeah Applause Music Albany still leading by one and he throws it away there Here Comes Kihei Clark Cedric riding shotgun and he gets fouled thats something that they can do you know not many teams have as a center that can get in the past and letting speed disruptive thats what Cedric does he provides that thats the spark they want from him defense rebounding offense and defensive and finishing it in pain follows against Malik Ed Mead so thats two on him after he came in following two fouls against their starting point guard Marcus Jackson so well see what coach killings likes to do here folks dont forget Friday afternoon at college basketball triple header begins with Pittsburgh and North Carolina suddenly a pretty interesting one that didnt seem like it before the season but thats a good game at noon Eastern on acc Network Caleb love and 25 Carolina taking on Blake Hinson whos been a revelation for the Panthers this year that ones at the peach should be a great afternoon of Hoops right here on acc Network and the ESPN app Music both of those teams struggled early but theyre playing some of their best basketball right now thatll be really tough game for Carolina All Conference games and stuff and Pitch playing really well right now since the pressure from UVA is picking up yeah maybe expanding the pack line a little bit Hutcheson has one three already that one wont go missed it by a wide margin and Franklin is rewarded for the hustle as you Albany called for the foul sometimes the pressure it doesnt relate you know doesnt result in a steal result a quick shot like that one and Applause airball it speeds you up sometimes get you off balance thats already seven fouls against you Albany in the first half so with over six minutes to play Franklin will go to the line and shoot a one and one quite a few good female Shooters on his team but you want to get a guy like Franklin I always thought when I was struggling I wanted to get to the free throw line and get in the Rhythm and you encourage guys to do that so good sight for him hes starting to come out of him and make some shots and again these guys hadnt had a lot of practice I mean coming home from Christmas break and Im pretty Im sure a lot of these guys didnt find a gym doing Christmas break Im sure they kind of might have found the eggnog yeah yeah Im sure they sat up onto mom and dad got some homemade cooking and everything else and favorite meals and everything that that I still do today when I go see my mom so its a 70 run for UVA as beagle scores a little baby hook this beagle is a nice young pup for the Great Dance he is hes a skilled big and really love to get over that left shoulder to that jump hook and difficult shot to block him again hes a talented player really good freshman coach killings was joking with us to shoot around today says hey I tell Jonathan beagle my career rests on your shoulders hes a great freshman who could take you Albany to New Heights as Franklin steps back and cant score in and out punches in the rebound doing a really good job you already have defending down on that we would Block action by UVA Davis from way downtown oh he talked a little junk to the whos bench as well confident group as they should be I mean they felt as though the toughness about him that comes from coach killings I mean he he wants his guys to get after him Cedric left alone great penetration by ka Clark took advantage of the Daviss pressure Applause move and went down the lane and laid it off to the big fella great sign for UVA if Shedrick is being aggressive eagle with a nolook pass deflected by Franklin with 14 on the shot clock itll stay here with a great dates good job Bob Franklin there comes over to help tragic recovery from the ball screen then goes back and hes got back doors and gets his hand in reflection its what you want to see multiple efforts on the defensive end and again if you want to play for Tony Bennett because he was benched a couple of games ago didnt play much its not just the offensive into Tony you dont Music Applause defense you got to sit down dream how to do it on both sides Francisco caporo came in for Cedric seeing his first action tonight with three on the shot clock Hutcheson has to fire missed it off the back iron and capro in there to pull down the rebound Applause Don left open in the corner that wont go by the way before you get on Twitter Francisco cathero has told us that he prefers kafaro as the pronunciation the Redshirt senior from Argentina hes been on top of the world ever since his home country won the World Cup he also likes to be called poppy but yeah Im going to call him his legal man when I call it a young man so well steer clear of that one yeah Ill call him Catherine so well stick to that more great defense from the hoos three to go drum ghoul has to forces it and its a shot clock violation thats the defense theyre accustomed to seeing here and UVA needs to get back to we got a tied ball game here great game John Paul Jones Arena players and he needs only three wins to pass Terry Holland as the alltime winningest coach in in the history of whos basketball hes also seven seven shy of 400 as a head coach in total he had 69 wins in three years of Washington state to begin his head coaching career hes come here to John Paul Jones and done the same in case you forgot about Terry Holland great head coach for UVA for almost two decades and Randolph hes got a connection to your career as well he does uh Dave Oden was an assistant his and left UVA and came to Wake Forest and recruited me and I was part of that first class and so much of what we did was influenced by Terry Holland and I believe it was you know obviously Odom added his you know he got the head coaching his changes in labor and things but he has a tremendous amount of respect for Coach Holland and Ricky Stokes was on that staff and so we had quite a bit of a UVA influence during that time Music under 10 to shoot for the whos here weve had six lead changes and three ties including this one Gardners got to go did not get it off before the horn sounded so thats a shot clock violation against the Cavaliers which they typically do to the opponents and of course their ninth shot clock violation of the Season before we went to the break which meant 150 sandwiches from the market are donated to the Boys and Girls Club which is like so UVA right they wore shot clock violations thats when they give away stuff do we get any no sandwiches I want to know Im gonna put my order in I didnt I didnt I didnt get the email on that one so we can go to Pico rap afterwards there you go you off and hes really changing up their defenses and is bothering UVA meaning UVA that on the defensive end he came and doubled the post late and poor Gardner by surprise Here Comes Jonathan beagle Vance here wanted to walk instead swung it out to Marcus Jackson who missed got his own rebound and Kihei Clark comes away with it Jacksons have to be careful he has two fouls Clark pushed the tempo got denied by Hutchison it stays here with the whos by the way that was you albanys first offensive rebound on the other side they couldnt convert Applause Kihei Clark is the trigger man from the Baseline already four assists for the fifth year senior from Woodland Hills California saw Jackson there just wanted to get him out so he picked up that third foul he trying to steal some minutes and get to the second half but on four and black Edmund also has two fouls tight defense against Clark Out of Bounds stays with a boost by the way on Clark four assists tonight 594 for his career now four behind Jeff Jones for second in program history Music Franklin and attack mode scores plus the foul speaking to Jeff Jones he actually took over after speaking of Coach houses he was the coach here doing the mid 90s great reject into the ball screen getting into paint playing off two feet scooping lay Franklin is really aggressive tonight I mean for a young man has come in has been struggling a little bit from behind the line the con this is what you need to do to get yourself going and just got to make plays sometimes everything just got to go off script play you might have been designed to come off he rejects it and gets in and finishes theres not a shot Blocker on the floor for you Albany so you need to attack the ram put pressure on the rim youre in the bonus worst thing they can do is file you theyre not going to break a shot so if you dont commit a turnover or charge get into the glass Clark applies the pressure takes it away Keith Clark hes been doing that for years here in Charlottesville hes just so tough so underrated leaves his team oh another one another one he says Ill have one more TA Clark is taking this game over you might want to get somebody else to initiate your offense now oh the fans are on their feet here at jpj Hutchinson cant silence him McNeely with the offensive rebound listen Kihei Clark that is his career in two plays right tight defense takes it away and scores yeah hes got to get some help with the offensive end it takes a lot of energy to do that break right there just too great I dont know if Ive seen that in quite some time back to back give me that kicking his pockets early how many guys committed to doing that thats what makes that young man so special not many guys are truly committed to that theyll just zigzag drill just go through the motions and he actually pushed pressure in the ball capro missed the front end of a one and one rebounded by Jaden Gardner for UVA stays here with the whos kicks it out McNeely in the corner before he does though a foul is called on the floor against you Albany it goes against Trey Hutchison and UVA in the double bonus now uba is what a 90 run right now just Music we got a womens basketball double header for you tomorrow Olivia miles a number five Notre Dame and Coral Gables to take on Miami at six Eastern followed by Duke and number six NC State hoping to have guard Diamond Johnson back for this Tobacco Road Showdown both games right here on ECC Network and the ESPN app capro came in a six of seven free throw shooter on the season missed three in a row still the largest lead for UVA on a 90 run I mean In fairness cities to both teams you just dont get a lot of time so the defense has to carry you through you dont know what youre going to get in the offensive end we saw these guys should just get back you get four or five days off of travel and come back here time out Dwayne killings with a minute one to play in the first half in the whos on a 90 run Randolph Childress who sees guys everywhere we go no one knows Randolph Childress a town thats part of the problem theres drum goal swings it to sarju Patel who can make that shot doesnt hear Kihei Clark runs down the rebound for uba and theyll slow it down still breathing heavily after his backtoback pickpockets and layups part of a 90 run for Virginia believes that Gardner scores it hey Clark is stealing in this first half hes getting wherever he wants to get on the floor again and clear out the side for him must be an emphasis to reject the ball screen get to the pain another drop off a gardner Gardner in double figures he and Franklin have 20th to 33 for Virginia you Albany can hold for one take one Davis smashed up with Kihei Clark Five left in the first half drum goals got to go does he see the clock beagle did not get it away Virginia will end the first half on an 110 run to lead by nine gray half great job about you being a defensive end thats what they want to double down hang their hat on didnt shoot it or shoot it well early turned it on in the last five minutes of the second half great half by the Wahoos come back and join us in the second half here is flying Southwest get back to the New Albany game but thank you theyre excited nonetheless thanks for sticking with us here on acc networked Ricardo Randolph Childress our entire outstanding ACC Network crew glad to be here for first game in eight days for both these teams Jaden Gardner had a great first half misses the first shot of the second half of that company and taking that great shot which is his specialty Music Garner had double figures in the first half along with Armand Franklin a couple of transfers leading the way for UVA Gerald drum drum ghoul missed the turnaround jumper from the Baseline hes you all but hes leading scorer this year only two points tonight one of seven Great Danes have missed their last eight field goals as that packed line defense starts to tighten the screws any shot tonight McNeely goes to the cup Isaac McNeely first Deuce of the second half for Virginia makes it a 13nothing run yeah its been airball Central for you all know its just a credit to uvas defense I mean they really get after theyre gonna theyre gonna compete and contest every shot you know the intentions and when they dont turn you know turn you over they want to speed you up and at some point I expect you all because you settle down one thing that they did early in the first half himself a chance to make shots right now in this UVA defense is just getting after them sometimes I think these guys are just sped up our statistician Richard Simmons has been tracking air balls and says there have been four tonight for you Albany thats why hes the best in the business there you go were not talking about the size Guru Richardson extraordinary the great statistician here thats another shot clock violation thats two tonight for you Albany and as Richard says 10 on the season forced by Virginia 150 more sandwiches are going to the Boys and Girls Club Applause its a great stat to challenge your guys too this is standard at the uvas Hall of Fame coaches gee hey Clark zip surpass Jayden Garner took one hard dribble couldnt finish through Trey Hutchison yanked away the rebound heres Malik edmeade its a typical outstanding true freshman had his pocket picked by McNeely great job being a low man in the corner McNeely rotating over still in that equates into a quick transition Corner three by Armon Franklin its a 16nothing run for Virginia their longest of the season and Tony Bennetts team leads by 14 gray steel rotates over picks his pocket comes down key head clock rewards his teammate you while whos up 14 here early in the second half teams and he has a tremendous amount of respect for Kihei Clark because thats how he played really good on ball Defender and tremendous point guard for his teams in such a great history of point guards here at UVA especially recently under Tony Bennett Clark the next in a long line as drum ghoul misses again you albanys only hit two shots in their last 10 minutes by the way Kihei Clark tonight playing in his 139th career game that is a program record breaking a tie with London parentis and Mike Toby I gotta I got a fair question for you great movement moved by Gardner has a strong move for Points 11 and 12 and the pose for him hes gets most of his points facing the bass great job filling the body and spending off going Baseline quick question before you put your gun do you think that some of these super seniors in fifth and six years stat wise should you know where did that go as far as the guys have played him for you hold on hold on McNeely right to the count offensive foul foreign Applause Music call from Paul sells I thought he was leaning back just a little bit Music nice job by drum goal just to get over there and at least fake it yeah I thought he was trying to avoid him and he uh good call good call his contact there uh to answer your question though before we were so rudely interrupted should the super seniors be able to you know be in there of course they should I just want to know you would not make me clear the stats should stay no doubt 20 percent um will they be something that acknowledges you know three or four year guys thanks very fine great luck from Jonathan beagle he has shown us everything I mean hes taken threepoint shot he didnt make his three but really good in the polls showing you his passing ability there and really impressive for a skill big there I found Trey Hutchison for the deuce and you know satellite games for Kihei Clark playing in number 139 tonight just so impressive this stability and continuity as he swings a pass to Gardner who scores it plus the foul hes just controlling the game right now hes living in a paint they cant guard him find him easy basket for his teammates great point guard played there by Kihei Clark good finish by Gardner seven assists for Kihei Clark I mean hes just coming off the screen punches him with the late switch late help and thats just too deep penetrations too deep theres nothing anybody can do defensively do you let the point guard get that deep 15 points for Jaden Gardner 26 in the paint for UVA only 12 for you Albany whos have as many pink points as the Great Danes have in general and this was ballooned to a 17point lead four minutes into the second half as beagle is trapped Sergio Patel hot potatoes it to Daquan Davis heres Malik Edmund with 10 on the timer already two shot clock violations tonight for the visitors beagle with five now two Davis has to hoist rebound to Caden Shedrick uvk UVA is just so such control right now at this game I mean defensively theyre dialed in they got back to their customary trap in the post there giving beagles some trouble and after a couple of times you just stopped looking to score as a beg and now theyre going to attack the Freshman inside spring passing right there beautiful ends up with McNeely theres three goes over the top thatll take us to our first media a sophomore forward for the Great Danes ACC fans if that last name sounds familiar his older Bros cam reddish who is part of that highly touted freshman class at Duke along with Zion Williamson and RJ Barrett cam reddish now playing for the Knicks free agent after the season and earlier this year Dwayne killings before the NBA season started went to a Knicks practice and told Cam hey make sure you keep that fire under Aarons feet every single day coach killings also says that you know in all honesty Aaron can do some things that other guys can he has some of that cam reddish athleticism yeah hes got good size as well you know hes shooting 36 from the field 47 from Total and uh 37 33 behind the line I mean hes so low for heavy and hes playing behind drum cool with their best scores so its tough for him to get on the court right now but I think hell find himself on the floor come conference play at some point Kihei Clark with space pulls up and drills it what a night for Kihei Clark if he starts knocking down threes good luck good luck trying to guard him I mean he lives in a paint and he was shooting above 40 percent earlier in the year and I think more realistically back down to the one you know if he can shoot around 36 37 I think as a team they take that and I think its where they want to be with the defense that he plays Jonathan beagle The Freshman spins and lays it in that is a big time move right there for a freshman I mean just touch two yeah just driving right spinning back left did a really good job defending it the first half and gotta move in One Direction there theyre falling back into that 23 Zone Gardner to Shedrick lost it no foul out of bounds UAlbany ball the Great Danes got a piece but did not touch the big man and watched this move by beagle and thats what you do when youre playing against a defendant as more physically stronger than you are he cant back shut you down so he drives rice spins back left you want to move a big like that and you just dont see freshman doing that so early in their career man hes gonna be a tough hes gonna be a tough guard an American East I dont see very many big men being able to guard this young man yeah hes an impressive young big man six double doubles this year another big man for ulb Tyree Kettner cant score good defense from Shedrick and Virginia comes the other way leading by 18 they put a little cushion between them and the Great Danes mocha defense from Ed mead with half the shot clock on Clark got fouled as he went up not many outside of UVA will remember this but when this team was had the perimeter shooting when Trey Murphy that was guys was here they would actually post Ki a Clark I mean we doubled him in the post I know that sounds funny but we literally doubled him Im seriously we doubled in the post I mean hes 510 but he could when they had that perimeter shooting around him they would post him and he was a handful in the post Music itd be a great afternoon of Hoops right here on acc Network and the e is Clark splits him you Albany comes the other way Music to you Albany now youre looking at what do we got to do to get shots to get open looks here and this defense is extended to suffocating great job about slip there does not result in points for Trey Hutchison Albany has now missed their last seven threes Clark Armand Franklin to the hole great reject dropped Baseline plays off two again no shot blocker there elevates and finishes 15 points for Armon Franklin as reddish comes back and misses a triple that is now five air balls for you Albany tonight seven air balls for you Albany tonight I mean thats thats what this UVA defense does to people yeah I think they just sped up a little bit as well you get down a little bit of panic no coach killings encouraging this guy some of those shots are good I mean if I just in the last three there was a good look you slipped the ball screen and cleared out the side for him and he knocked it down the first half didnt knock that one down but just want to run your offense if you you already continue to get shots just nothing to be discouraged about shooting air balls against this UVA defense wont be the last team to do that this year Here Comes Ryan Dunn the true freshman from Long Island jump ball arrow with the Great Danes five turnovers against UVA yeah another five two of them been jump balls like that one and freshman as he gets stronger hell be able to clear the lane there and get that up on the glass but his versatility on the defensive end going forward is is something that this UVA team doesnt really currently have on that roster thats switching forward that can stay in front of the ball and done gives me that versatility to play that DeAndre Hunter Road at three slash four theres radish hearing it from the fans here at jpj Nikon Davis Corrals it near midcourt a couple of steps to the basket missed it done with the rebound snares it and tight ropes the Baseline Franklin reddish closed up that airspace in a hurry be able to Big lineup in right now Franklin you bet I had barely even touched the net 17 for Iman Franklin its a good shot in Rhythm for him Applause hes gonna tell coach I need more time off I need more Christmas I need Christmas break I think itd be longer I shoot it better when I dont practice much just doing it on the defensive side as well deflection leads to a timeout Franklin in the whos rolling conference play now Reynolds what do you think of the ACC so far as you check out the standings I I think its wide open I think anybody can look at that league right now when you should be no matter where you are if you got up to a slow start or not I think we I think we know who the top five teams will be when it all shakes out I think I think its the who next like whos going to be you know is it Wake Forest like whos going to be the Wake Forest of a year ago whos going to be that that I think 16 I think we know who the top five are Marcus Jackson lost it Virginia takes it away interesting how Randolph Childress goes right to the Demon Deacons I mean they were I mean Im just being a year ago I mean they were the team to just kind of you know finished fifth in the league a year ago and this year States gotten off to a pretty good start picked with two big wins in the ACC theyre already two and oh and yeah you know Miamis the only team in the ACC thats gotten three wins and sneak is tough you know he gets a lot of flack but again we know this legs as good as anyone in any league in the country Nick Neely beat the buzzer missed the shot Gardner had the offensive rebound for a second itll stay here out of bounds off of you Albany Im with your partner for what its worth I mean Steve Forbes is so impressive you bring in Williams and laravia just for the one year both those guys show out Williams player of the year larabia is playing in the NBA consistently now yeah and then you just reload again Tyree Applebys one of the best players in the league so far he is and thank you for setting me up on that because I dont have to sound like a homer winner Ill do it Jeff Rose pass to Ryan Dunn office foot and out of bounds thats the sixth turnover against Virginia one of the best teams in the country and taking care of it top 10 in the country in that statistic I mean the transfers and I think Applebee has been probably the best impact with transfer I mean hes hes 18 and five his third and scoring seconded assist in the league you know Blake Henson is the reason the pit Panthers are 20 in the ACC to start and John Carroll Joyner is just such a leader at NC State Applause Music Smith and just a lot of basketball left to be played and you know its just a lot to be decided this Leagues wide open right now the turnovers in a row for Virginia they average under 10 turnovers per game this year seventh best in the nation coach killings even spoke on that he said were not going to turn them over so they want to get Second Chance points they want to make a lot of Threes they hadnt done that tonight they only hit three of 17 from three but I think the one area you think you can hurt them on his offense for rebounds and had done a great job with that island and Ive been looking for that I think they may have found their answers with the third leading scorer Music its been tonight for Virginia as drum goal goes to the holga defense from Jaden Gardner pounds be basketball as you see Beekman really one of the better better players in the ACC an allconference kind of guard for them been dealing with a hamstring injury and put up almost a triple double in their last game at Miami 1099 and thats dealing with an injury thats kept him out tonight I thought he was on his way of leaving Tony Bennett early at the end of the season the way he was playing I thought he was gonna you know and he still may do that but he was just such a pace and role had this team playing as good as any team in the country and he just does it all I mean hes taking the right shot shooting it at a high clip if the ball as well as anyone in the country and just an elite playmaker and decision maker as well Daquan Davis will pull up from anywhere heres Jonathan beagle left it way short offensive rebound you all but he Davis as I said as Jimmer range and that is rebounded by Isaac McNeil great job by you Albany though attacking the glass we talked about it a second ago wanting to get offensive rebounds the second chance points and nice twoman game McNeely got it back from capro Gardner the offensive rebound and hes fouled on his way up great job great playing off two feet there by McNeely ball found his way to Gardner I thought he had Gartner on the pass if he had looked to throw it to him earlier but when you where youre supposed to be the basketball guys reward you in Jane Gardners been there hes been everywhere he needed to be tonight on his way to a double double we have a womens basketball double header for you tomorrow Olivia miles a number five Notre Dame and Coral Gables to take on Miami at six Eastern followed by Duke and NC State Wolfpack hoping Diamond Johnson is back for that one both games right here on acc Network and the ESPN app Garner up to 16 points tonight type of guy who works extremely hard at the craft hes the first one out here shooting a couple hours before tipoff tonight and its good to see him light up the score sheet as hes been a little bit quieter statistically this year than last season after coming over from East Carolina its been hes thought about the year he was a little Sluggers to start but you know he was shooting 36 the first three games in the last seven games hes up to 60 percent you can see him continue that tonight hes had a strong strong game tonight thats far on his way like I said again to a doubledouble Hutchison Waits and scores off glass Music once albanys fifth field goal in the last 19 minutes Virginia Defense has looked like the Virginia Defense Music yeah and Tony Bennett is still not happy with him drive down the middle of the lane not too many times that happened vanderplas swings it out wide open three from tayne Murray Applause and the rebound goes to Davis sophomore from Auckland New Zealand could knock that one down here comes Malik edmied stopped by Vander Plus in a big hit to the deck by Edmund Applause good run down good after chase down block there by vanderbloss I thought he got him clean good block good hustle was good effort nonetheless thats three on vanderplas and had me in a 70 foul shooter will go to the left Applause Music Applause its grabbing his wrist there hope hes okay hes just shooting him right there his UVA is going to the bench Music Franklin back in there for McNeely changes for Tony Bennett and the leak at meat is now four for four at the line tonight Junior from Deer Park New York on Long Island hes more of a scoring point guard for this group and Marcus Jackson is the younger brother Ravon J Jackson and UConn Husky guard Applause so swirls out but hes fouled and will shoot two and Vander blouse will shoot the pair after the timeout with 7 44 to play Tony Bennetts team leads by 20 the only 30 team in League Play thus far might have the ACC player of their favorite as of now and Isaiah Wong Jim laronega closing in on history as well I mean adult Childress these guys look great in the early going they do I mean Isaiah Wong would be my vote to get player of the year if that wolf is handed out today and again at 30 I mean every win is a its a great win and no other team in the ACC is 30 and they just seem to be playing with a level of toughness right now throughout the team I mean theyre playing More Physical than that Ive seen them play in the past and Wongs decisionmaking and play making abilities you can see the Improvement in this game and thats a really good team they dont have a lot of size but that that team will be a difficult out as we get in the ACC play and vanderplas at the line for Virginia missed them both and the Whos lead remains at 20 theyve struggled from the line tonight thats probably that and shoot threes have been the two things that theyve struggled with I mean threepoint shooting hasnt been a big surprise from the struggling they hadnt shot a great lately but nine of 16 from the free throw line This is a bit shocking only 56 percent up 72 on the season and Virginia takes it away you think Isaiah Wong and Kihei Clark are in AARP together these two dudes have been playing ACC basketball for what feels like 20 years I feel like I I thought I might have played against him once or twice but they just aged better I thought it was TJ Clark they needed a paint doing what he does its finding guys Music Applause Tony Bennett will miss this young man when he leaves great shot by Franklin he seems to have found his shooting stroke stepping in and confidently making shots toward his 20th point of the game so far and hes playing solid defense hes been really going to be defensive end as well all right so just 18 points combined in his last three none at Miami he was bagel for the first time this season last Tuesday is UAlbany coughs it up again their 10th turnover tonight and well back to Armon Franklin I mean defense to offense thats what Tony Bennett told us at shoot around today thats how they get the offense going when they fall into a slump when the guys going to slump and they get they fall they find themselves at the end of Tony Bennetts benches not because theyre missing shots its because when they miss shots and this happens throughout college basketball that the basketball gives you energy and so when guys arent making shots they tend to stop doing all the other things like defending and screening and all the other little small parts of the game and Tony Bennett if youre not going to do those things youre just not going to play Music Clark the Airborne pass stolen by you Albany Malik Ed Mead gear at all times scooped it to drum ghoul who missed a three drum goal has really struggled tonight one of ten and oh a five from deep and they really needed him if they had a chance tonight their top scorer vanderplas saves it yeah I think some of the size in the length and physicality of UVA is bothering him some and if they had a chance to win this game they definitely going to need him to make some shots under 10 to shoot commanderplas to Clark Clark always has his eyes up feeds vanderplas who knocks down a triple thats why vanderbloss is so important to this team because he takes your big and he stretches the floor it allows them to play more four out and opens up the paint for Kihei Clark and when Reese Deacon comes back I mean it was the shot Vander Bloss fighting for the rebound stays here with you Albany thats first points for Vander plas tonight hes been in foul trouble only played 13 minutes with the three fouls after he started for the first time in a Cavaliers uniform yeah he jinxed himself now he got a he gave coach Bennett a reason to bring him back off the bench Danny but no he plays really really hard and staff loves him and they Rave about him you hear the Ovation Kihei Clark checks out Chase Coleman comes in should be it for the fifth year point guard for UVA what a night it was for Kihei Clark eight points 10 assists and backtoback pickpockets going right to the basket that Virginia fans here at jpj tonight will remember for a long time Patel is three off the back of the rim Shedrick the rebound and Chase Coleman at the controls for the first time tonight yeah its good to see him get some playing Tom hes one of those guys does all the little things in practice and 510 senior from Norfolk steps back and missed it Shedrick tried to jam it gets it back and does Applause Cedric battles on the offensive glass continue to do what he did to start the game but look at that confident shot by Coleman man hes just stepping the game and Jack of three I mean thats thats impressive man step back to hit that we could all use that much confidence in life shedra cleaned up the Miss Virginia almost doubling up you Albany hit and back here for Syracuse and North Carolina comes to town on January 10th yeah theyll be they cant look that far down the road I mean Georgia Techs a well coached team and you know they defend well themselves and like we talked about pit that teams playing confidently theyre two and only ACC so you want to Circle that down the road Im sure thatll be a pretty big game and but even when you get to Syracuse theyre starting to play better basketball theyre young guys are legitimates and Kenny Williams the guys there their young guys are starting to take a step and and you never know what youre going to get out of guys a lot of teams take a step doing this Christmas break now and use that time to double up on some practices and get better and being impressed with him hes really been good he is really really good and draws the foul there a freshman will shoot too its been fun to watch he doesnt look sped up he doesnt look overwhelmed hasnt made his threes but just looks comfortable when hes out there moves at his own pace six points for the true freshman speaking of moving at your own pace you see what Luka doncic did oh my goodness I mean thats just ridiculous all right so a missed free throw by beagle its about to get really loud in here Applause free bacon is on the line oh but the skillet away folks ah theyre actually blowing them oh we gotta try this place man it must be pretty good because this place gets loud they want their bacon man I think the the fans here at jpj are saying foul foul every time down the floor Applause Music Chase Coleman is out there for Virginia Kihei Clarks night appears to be over great get him along with Jaden Gardner and Armon Franklin Ryan Dunns out there Tain Murray has it now Kaden Shedrick with seven on the timer goes to work kicks it out Ben vanderplas for three Applause Colemans getting you know minutes here because you just dont know how long you know Reese beatman look like hes gonna be ready to play but in the pinch Colemans gonna have to give them minutes they cant throw Kihei clock out there for 40 minutes so hes coming in this last five minutes I think hell finish the game drum ghoul draws the foul against Dunn you cant play Clark too much I mean at his age you know hey no hes probably over there with the ice bags on his knees right now I mean you got to take care of the vet guys now Music Applause if you look at the uvas bench too Jason willifords not an adventure I know hes a little under the weather and hes the associate head coach of that of that staff its a great staff over there one of the best group of people best group of men youll ever meet in that staff just all led by Tony Bennett whos just go ahead and get him in the Hall of Fame get it over with while you can enjoy it he is he is he is as good as he gets in his league and in the country man hes fun to watch him Music yeah there is no doubt about it threetime national Coach of the Year National Champion closing in on History theres three wins to pass Terry Holland as the alltime winningest coach here at UVA this will be his 325th his daughter his daughters a demon Deacon by the way shes a senior dick I gotta call her out though she she didnt know the basketball greats that Wake Forest I didnt know Chris Paul and dont kill so many guys like that was a notable Omission who else did she not know Randolph childrens I expected to know this old guy but you know I expected to know some of those other guys she didnt even know John Collins right the most recent guy so but Tony did say he set her straight he kind of told it that was their discussion over Christmas dinner so Music I like Tony even more now now that he kind of acknowledged thats right some of my guys educating the youth there you go fulltime job even when its your kids Ryan Dunn with a nice post move he is on the board the seventh different Cavalier to score tonight Armon Franklin led the way with 20 Jayden Gardner with 16 Applause Music Applause Music great driving kick there by Davis again Davis got himself a foul trouble but he shot the ball really well and thats his third three tonight oh Murray tried to stuff it he got fouled by Marcus Jackson and well shoot a couple by the way Albany with 14 points in the second half here the lowest by any Virginia opponent this season was 21 by Monmouth and just 14 for UAlbany tonight and I can assure you theyre theyre conscious of that number and theyre going to continue to guard if they cant hold him to that number Dwayne killings knew it would be a steep hill for his UAlbany team to climb tonight as Murray is good on his first free throw well folks weve seen some amazing fans across the ACC and now we need your help this winter ACC Network wants to experience each sport from your perspective so snap a pick or take a video tag it with hashtag all the devotion and post it to your social media you just might see it on acc note your coach killings right now you just want you guys to continue to guard continue to defend and again both of these teams are getting ready for conference playing dont let the score dictate how you play you want to start building continue to build good habits like that Jonathan beagle man another great play thats a tip in plus the foul Music just a great job getting inside Catherine didnt box him out didnt see him Mr blocks out and Music Applause beagle being Johnny on the spot cleaning it up and hes been impressive hes been really good its been fun to watch Applause I would imagine him being a big force in the American east a bright future keep in mind for you all but youre missing a couple key guys with injuries cafro goes to work and scores over the top Jennifer says I got to go back at him screw it up didnt box out and gave up the rebound he and one and I gotta at least make up for it drum ghoul fires and hits and finally a Triple Falls for the great Deeds maybe a little its a little too late but uh every time out on the four wheel step aside for 30 seconds with the hoos leading by 23 thanks for hanging with us Ricardo Randolph Childress Courtside as Tony Bennetts team is just a minute 29 away from snapping a twogame losing streak against Houston and Miami Cavaliers are on the road at Georgia Tech on New Years Eve next is Kihei Clark leads the whos into conference play Music is standing by the way hes hes not he doesnt have to jump to do that Music too I mean some of these guys that are playing right now they have to continue to try to add onto that rotation you see Coleman in the game and again Reese Speakman being out and even done you know these guys got to get ready for conference play here and Coleman left it short rebound Davis Applause again will pull from anywhere rebound saved by Japan at Kellogg for you Albany with under a minute now to play in the second half Music Davis again I love the confidence 100 I love the confidence thats NBA range Im open Im going shooting I love guys to say hey if I see the rim Im open Applause Music Coleman to caparo he is fouled on his way to the hole great place by Colby getting in the lane hes missed the last jump shot got in played off too and laid it off for the Big Fellas lets get into a spot great job by calf row cylinder point guard on the switch punishing the guard inside uvas really hurt them when theyve tried to hedge and get back and stay on their man that time they switched and when youre guard you want to get him under that big and keep it from rolling and Catherine did a really good job of selling the guard at the time and was rewarded for it with the pass well the one thing UVA wants to clean up maybe is the free throw shot yeah its been tough thats capro oh for five now theres a team theyre 11 of 19 58 percent three on the way is good for you Albany and Malik and Mead and the Great Danes now Trail by 20 just 20 well theyre starting to extend the impression now I thought theyd do a little bit earlier but no reason to be embarrassed here they scored 46 points I mean his UVA team is one of the best defensive teams in the country time to get back get ready for conference play Wahoos in the twogame skit and get back on winning track and get ready for conference play Tony Bennetts team is back in the win column with a 20point win over you Albany tonight at John Paul Jones Arena great job by uba I mean I think UVA defensively is the kind of performance you want get back to doing things being solid on the defensive end he did that tonight forced a ton of air balls Rush shots
