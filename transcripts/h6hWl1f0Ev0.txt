15 points scoring and against this team tonight Virginia was their tough defense theyre going to need an enforcer a strong guy who is willing to press that point he has had an outstanding season with a 12 combo with the front court for Clemson to PJ Hall and Hunter Tyson each team is without a pretty important player Alex heavenway of Clemson an emergency appendectomy a couple days ago hes okay but obviously not playing Ben Vander plus talented big man grad transfer for Virginia broke his hand in practice a few days ago hes done for the rest of the season the screen rescreen action to get Reese Speakman open he gets it inside to Jaden Gardner and Jaden Garners excellent oneonone in the post great job by Galloway to knock it away some interesting matchups Galloway starting on Gardner you might have some bigs on Smalls and Smalls on Biggs as both coaches try to figure out what works best like Hunter Tyson is on Armon Franklin right now theyre going to beat sometimes when players have to switch nice look and the slam for Francisco capro and a foul to Booth Hunter Tyson just a little bit of contact when cathero got past him and often times in this blocker mover type offense the big guys the screeners are going to be open because you go with the cutter set a screen just a little wide pin down two on the ball they just drop it off to caparo and he gets the first basket for Virginia and you talked about it they take a lot of time on offense but theyre not standing around theyre making you guard and guard and Brad Brownell and every other coach they admit it could really wear on you the way that Virginia runs its offense and you have to be really patient in this game if youre Clemson because its a rhythm disrupting type of game Galloway the grad transfer from BC knocks it in to tie the game Brevin Galloway started his career at Charleston forgive me a onepoint lead capro missed the free throw Galloway a sixth year Collegiate player it was 25 years old hes getting AARP mailings Clark the kick back out to Franklin Now beefman how good was beefman for Virginia last night in the win over Carolina and hes good every game hes such a great defender Gardner keeps it alive amidst a trio of tigers and kicks it back out Virginia doesnt get a ton of offensive rebounds but what they get is usually Jaden Gardner Kihei Clark and the rebound to Ian sheplin who has played two of the best games of his career in the last two for Clemson great against Notre Dame on the weekend and then terrific last night against NC State and how about that Banks went in right over Capra might have gotten away with a walk but took the contact from kafaro which was not insubstantial and still finished the play all right sheplin is such a good passer as well Clark wide open behind a screen and he buries it you cant dare him from the threepoint line Clark hangs in part to that fifth covet year the most games starts and wins in Virginia basketball history seems like he was recruited alongside othell Wilson Tyson into Hall double team you know its coming he kicks it good pass Chase Hunter and the rebound down to Gardner not a lot of offensive rebounds available against Virginia so they send all Five Guys to the defensive class even the guards get in there and get their noses dirty on the glass great effort and a foul called on Jaden Gardner what a play by the Tigers to force that turnover Chase Hunter Brad Brownell the winningest coach in Clemson basketball history he has taken his team to the NCAA tournament three prior times again to my two eyes and Jays two eyes this looks like a tournament team of course Tony Bennett knows his hoos are going to the tournament they returned all five starters and 91 percent of their scoring from a team that went to the NIT last year theyve got Higher Goals right now I dont need two eyes to see the Clemsons a tournament team I just use my magic eyes Hunter Tyson Clemson has five quad one wins and four of them are away from home I mean I dont even know why this is a discussion this is an NCAA tournament team period Applause theyve beaten NC State three times handily all three times including last night when they roughed him up to the tune of 8054 and they beat Penn State early in the season in that big ten ACC Challenge and double dribble yeah but he do yeah they beat Duke I mean theyve had to be Pittsburgh theyve had really really good wins the pit win was on the road but a onepoint lead early here on to Virginia they lost their only game against Virginia that was just 10 days ago in Charlottesville and Virginia didnt score until the 1512 mark of the first half four minutes 48 seconds they didnt score were down five to nothing went on a 172 run and basically just kind of held them off from there winning 6457 whoop first down goes Tyson first down Applause and this games going to be physical yeah Clemson is a physical team theyve got some big bodies with PJ Hall Hunter Tyson theres shefflins a big body Vander Bloss out with a broken hand Tony Bennett was funny talking to us yesterday he said he got in front of the team and said that that he was showing them the the hand saying well this is where Ben broke his hand it was the metatarsal right and then he realized the doctor told no its medical corporate and and we were talking to the foot hand whats the difference The Meta something Galloway no capro the rebound so vanderplas out unfortunately if your ham wont have a chance to play in the tournament this year caparo starting and we will see a lot of Kaden Shedrick kind of a forgotten guy recently for Virginia did some good things last night against Carolina a good steal by Hunter Tyson how good is this guy First Team all ACC driving hard to the bucket and he draws the foul as we step aside for the first time tonight here in semifinal number two in Greensburg there are all kinds of products in this world rotation of college basketball is brought to you by New York Life over 12 000 agents there to help guide you through lifes happiest and most difficult times and Chang can dunk an original movie now streaming only on Disney plus so we talked about Clemson the big picture resume net quad wins etc etc you made the point theyve got five quad one wins well they had four going into last night they beat NC State on a neutral Port thats a quad one win so theyve got five right not so fast my friend and this is the trickiness of the Quad situation we talked about it one of their quad one wins was a road win at Virginia Tech who were in The Low 70s in the net and as long as youre in the top 75 of Road win counts as a quad one win when Virginia Tech lost they went to 76 in the net so Clemson lost that quad one win its now a quad two win and thats why people shouldnt get too hung up on quad one quad two because not all one and quad two wins are created equal and things can move around a lot but it doesnt invalidate the win that Clemson had in Blacksburg but one of the things that these metrics have to be improved upon and especially the net is theres got to be a way there is a way to put a value on the game at the time it was played and not just the quad thing but the value of the performance so even the value of a performance and a really close loss youre losing double overtime thats not just a loss thats a quality performance worthy of a win that was a quality performance right there by Kaden Shedrick hes been a different player of the last couple games he was instrumental in that win over North Carolina Applause and again you know your record in Quad one quad two even the net as a whole those are just among the tools that the tournament selection committee uses to evaluate the team but it sure feels like Clemson has picked up the quality wins why are they not in even better shape because theyve had some kind of troubling losses they lost to Louisville they lost to Loyola Chicago they lost to South Carolina those are not typically the kinds of losses that tournament teams have at least not that many of them but they have a number of quality wins that other bubble teams dont have Applause Josh Beadle in Off the Bench good pass sheplin back to the freethrow line for a good late cut by Ian sheplin and that was not one of the better possessions for Clemson in the half court theyve got to get a little bit more movement because if youre going against this hackline defense which does a great job of staying in gaps and making it difficult to get into the paint they force you into help its tough to its really hard to get easy baskets against Virginia theres almost no such thing because its hard to get offensive rebound baskets its really hard to get anything in transition because Virginia really only sends one maybe two to the offensive class when it suits them but they want to get back and take away your transition one of two for sheplin who had 15 points six rebounds last night in the win over the Wolfpack playing his best basketball right now when it matters the most Music Beekman underneath bothered by sheplin Beekman got it back Applause close out there by Chase Hunter now Beekman shut off on the Baseline by sheffler that shot fake is so good and the reverse for Kihei Clark Kihei Clark stays low on that shot fake its almost like he gets down in The Stance and lifts that ball over his head and just gets the defender off balance then he drives it hes in perfect position to drive with the way he executes that fake good pick and pop and this is where PJ Hall is so dangerous doesnt hit here but a 41 threepoint shooter on the season anytime he sets a ball screen he needs to get out of it quickly whether its a roll or a pop so he can present himself as a receiver Applause get off the bench for Virginia freshman Isaac McNeely Player of the Year in the state of West Virginia last year and he can do this he can do that beautiful little fade screen set by Ryan Dunn and the throw over the top gotta have a little more pressure on the ball but McNeely sets those feet really quickly done and McNeely both freshmen both played very well in the winter for Clemson 10 days ago another Miss from Beyond the Archer Hall and Hall obviously can make that the pick and pop was a little bit better of a shot that was more what I would call a subtle on the Tyson getting ready to check back in Applause constant movement constant screening and Kihei Clark always looking for the open man shot clock running down and a shot clock violation now watch this shot face by Kihei Clark catches the ball just lifts up and gets Hunter just off balance a bit and then he gets all the way to the basket now the pass and then the fade screen Ryan Dunns going to set up its a little little fade screen along the top and right out to the threepoint line just beautifully executed by Virginia one of the problems with that program he cant clap bark to the bench as Armon Franklin has returned for Virginia Ben Middlebrooks has checked in for Clemson sophomore from Fort Lauderdale beat strong guy in every 10 games some good minutes last night RJ Godfrey a freshman who tried to gather in that rebound Brad Brownell very pleased with his younger players last night Clemsons freshman theyre capable now theyre going to be really good its an Exxon class if Brad Brownell brought in thats a tough one and Franklin kind of drifting to his right through the key and really good defense by Godfrey on that and then he ran the floor just couldnt make the catch Beekman the defensive player of the year in the conference and pretty good at the offensive end as well but that one blocked and then saving it under your opponents bucket a Reese Speakman was right there to pressure the intended passer and you just got to take that one out of bounds you cant risk it the Tigers now scoreless for over three minutes not anymore Tyson for three but how good it was that read of the defense instead of curling off that screen the defender jumped it and Hunter Tyson is very quickly faded to the threepoint line and man was he ready to shoot that didnt take long to get off at all shoots at least 40 percent from three Beekman a bit of a line drive jumper there in the back Come the Tigers and because everyone was on the Baseline thats really the only time youre going to see Clemson get any sort of transition but still Virginia able to get back cover up for us a really tough two Applause long long stretch without a whistle Franklin got it and Armon Franklin has had just a fantastic year shooting close to 40 percent from three and he shot over 40 percent of Indiana but I think it took him a while to get used to the PACE and where his shots were coming from but he is completely comfortable on both ends of the floor this year Tyson wants you guarded by Franklin middlebrooks down on the Block Tyson Alaska good defense by Franklin Applause McNeely open Applause hes one of these every time he shoots if you think its going in kind of guys he can really shoot Applause good position down low but Shedrick wins the battle with Middlebrooks this stayed strong and long to bother that shot by Ben middleports that was a really good duck in by Middlebrooks shetrick a guy who did not play at all in the last two regular season games for Virginia but with vanderplas out sharing the minutes up front now with Capri does a good job of setting screens and playing off of them Applause Franklin lost it three to shoot got punch and will be at the line when we come back Armon Franklin leading this Virginia team and scoring 13 points per game Virginia tied for the league title without a score in the accs top 20 but they play at a slower pace and Hunter Tyson First Team all ACC the great Fade to the threepoint line in the longtime manager Anna will Williamson she is a senior this year and when she got to climb up the stairs and cut down part of the net when they were cochamps of the ACC Tony Bennett and all the players said it was one of the most special moments they can remember you see Anna was born with spina bifida she is paralyzed from her knees down shes undergone over 10 surgeries to try to get the ability to walk and even now shes wearing a heavy brace that allows her to control her foot on the right hand side shes graduating from Virginia shes been a huge piece of this teams chemistry the love that they have on this squad and shes opening her own coffee shop in Charlottesville in August its called Revival and I promise you Anna I will be one of your first and best customers she is a true true inspiration what a wonderful story Holly thank you so much for that Jay you have always championed managers and I think you said it last night to anybody looking to hire people if you want to hire somebody young whos going to work hard and be outstanding in whatever it is theyre pursuing basketball managers should be at the top of the list and Anna member of a great managerial crew at Virginia they are the best Ive seen in a practice of getting the bubble for for like a bubble drill into the bucket now last year they had a they had an episode where it took him three or four chances and Tony Bennett let him know about it but thats an outstanding managerial crew Reverend Galloway lays it in and its a fourpoint game bananas coffee shop is gonna thats gonna put a shiver in the spine of the mud house right there behind the Army for mud house and Revival go to both Applause none of your business Franklin out chain Murray into the game a sophomore from Auckland New Zealand Applause Murrays a good shooter hes just one of 11 from three this season a good pearl of that screen by Isaac McNeely shot box inside five capro pass and Muriel hit it how about that just his second three of the season now two of 12 but give Francisco caporo credit for making that Cross Court pass Francisco Francisco thats fun to say this was graffaro until earlier this season when we were totally preferred to cap hero let it go away had one on one in the post after ball reversal and looked middle and found Chaplin was in the lane and he found tame Murray wide open crosscourt that was an excellent pass by Cafaro and he was very excited about Argentinas win in the World Cup yes Tony Bennett had to change practice time so that he could watch the game otherwise in practice he would have his iPhone looking at what was going on thats understandable absolutely understand so here at the line is Brevin Galloway from Anderson South Carolina about 15 miles away from Clemson campus was not offered a scholarship by Clemson out of high school and a sixth year senior as we mentioned Charleston BC and now back to Clemson for his final year getting a chance to play really close to home they play for Earl Grant at Charleston with Earl to Boston College up top and deflected away it will stay with the Virginia seven on the shot clock Clemson working so hard to stay in gaps but when youre chasing Cutters around that makes it really difficult because Virginia moves your deep DJ Hall and Clemson trailing Virginia 2218 7 56 to go first half the winner of this one to take on Duke in the championship game tomorrow night 8 30 Eastern Time on ESPN shot clock at two beakman knows it the follow will go for Jaden Gardner well when you are chasing around screens chasing Beekman and then shuffling had to switch off its so tough to get a blockout responsibility on Jaden Gardner and the pace at which Virginia its a slow pace team overall but they dont run their offense slowly they run it with great pace and its constant movement coming off of screens you get two of the ball they give a little pocket pass get a layup and right now their depth is showing up too McNeely done Murrays hit a big shot Shedrick in Off the Bench both ends of the floor with the injury to vanderplas theyve still got good death Gardner his second bucket in a row so dangerous down in that low post because he doesnt go into your but he goes into your body to create space but then he can hit that little turnaround jumper fade away one of the best midrange and post games in college basketball and he showed him when he was at East Carolina the average 19 20 a game he was all American Athletic Conference great ball Movement by the Tigers Galloway to miss sheplin the offensive board the kick to Tyson and a couple of good looks from Beyond The Arc but nothing doing for the Tigers you can feel like its so hard to establish Rhythm offensively when youre playing against Virginia if you take a quick shot then all of a sudden its a time of possession game youre spending all your time on defense good pass Gardner of the Miss pretty feed though from Kihei Clark those little pocket passes are so difficult you want to stop the drive but I think you got to make Keith Clark finish Applause all into the chest of Shedrick and he converts well it shows his strength there this knocking Shedrick back creating that space and going up with a little jump hook PJ Hall is such a good player theres so many what I would call respected players on the floor you know Rhys Beekman Kihei Clark Hunter Tyson PJ Hall guys that coaches around the league and players they just respect they know how hard it is to play against these guys and Gardner draws the foul on Dylan Hunter because of the pace that Virginia plays with you have to run off so many screens theres a little screen of pearl another screen little Zoom action turns the corner and now you gotta all of a sudden you have a guard trying to block out Jaden Gardner Music and Brad Brownell when we were talking to him this morning he said you know their offense helps their defense their defense helps their offense you have to work so hard on your defense that maybe youre not quite as sharp or as you know energetic as you want to be on offense because youre spending so much time guarding them on the other end its a its a mentally challenging game to play against Virginia and you know I mean I joke about it but its kind of true its kind of like sitting at a dentist office for two hours youre not going to get the pace you normally get your shots arent coming where they normally come from everythings difficult stolen away by Clark whos better coming from behind and getting those knock aways and steals and now the offensive rebound for Clark Sparks studies peoples dribble he knows when the balls hitting the floor and coming back up and when to take it away all down with a rebound for Clemson five minutes to go first half Virginia by seven well you have to know where Kihei Clark and respeakman are on the floor at all times theyre so good defensively when youve got the ball you know exactly where key here clock is hes right here right near the grill yep beekmans more like that uh free safety or Nickelback you dont see him until the balls in the air and then you see him good action run by Brad Brownell theyre just getting PJ Hall to that left elbow made the catch against Shedrick he could get to that right hand for the isolation drive at the elbow pocket fast again and Cedric with an and one opportunity Virginia offense at its finest right there if you give too much attention to Kihei Clark coming off that screen when he curls it you know the big guy helps out so PJ Hall tries to give attention to it he gives that little pocket pass to Kaden Shedrick and now Halls got to recover and he was in the restricted Arc and thats an automatic block and a great finish by Shedrick Applause Im on Franklin returns Kihei Clark will sit in a seven point when Virginia has a seven point lead it feels like another team has a 15 point lead you see the numbers there and how unusual is that to have two guys on the same team be second and third in a conference whatever conference in assists especially at the lower possession rate that Virginia plays out they dont have as many possessions as other teams in the league Clemson needed that one Hunter Tyson delivers with a three well that can really stretch a defense out what an amazing year hes had I still think Hunter Tyson should have been not only first team ACC but the accs most improved player went from 10 points per game to 15 and a half five and a half rebounds per game to 96 well that was a wide open shot for Armon Franklin they just did a little screen rescreen action and itll be Virginia ball where do we come back 327 to go in the half whos by four he is with coach Bennett going over things thats who he is you know hes a smaller player five nine and coach Bennett said its easy to overlook Dimensions that if you think a guys too small but he was actually Mugsy bugs backup in the NBA and coach Bennett said when you see Hart when you see determination you know if a guy can play he can play and thats what he sees in Kihei Clark look at this young man all that hes done first in Games first in wins first in assists and he will go down as one of the best not just in Virginia history in ACC history what a heart soul and determination for Kihei Clark the intangibles are great the results are great and its like having another coach on the floor yeah I played with guys that did that in the huddle with the coach but it was more this is where I need to get the ball this is where I need my shots from no matter what Phyllis might have just told Mark the kick to Beekman and Clemson forces a turnover Clemson does such a good job with their Gap protection this is a great health defensive team they cover up for each other good passing a good look from the corner Chase Hunter cant knock it down that would have made it a onepoint game you cant say enough about the season that chase Hunter has had having to step into the point guard position with 11 points and nine assists against NC State Gardner got rid of it in a hurry and Armon Franklin somehow got the offensive Rebound with three Tigers right there nobody put a body on Armon Franklin and this is not a high volume offensive rebounding team Ryan Dunn soars for the rebound if youre not a Virginia fan and not familiar with him remember that name over the next couple of years and if youre a shirt maker you can make some money off him with the extra sleeve length good pass my goodness Gardner finds Franklin in the lead grows for the who just a spectacular cut from the top from Armon Franklin spectacular 30 seconds yeah if you get caught ball watching against Virginia it is a bucket Music so much going on around the country coming up at the halftime the AllState halftime report coach Fonz Reese Duke impressive in a hardfought win over Miami in the first semifinal here tonight and Kansas advancing to the title game to the Big 12 tournament maybe they can learn to get along by the time we come to them yeah I think its amazing the Speed and Agility of Reeses staff to get out of the shot when we take that his Butler his makeup people and the cast of thousands that take care of that toupee I should have missed on the three and its been one shot and out for Clemson and Clemsons had some good shot opportunities but I really do think the the fact that its so difficult to establish any offensive Rhythm against Virginia works against that should produce two offensive rebounds two and a half virginias you said they dont typically get a lot but theyve got six offensive rebounds another good pass and another bucket and its the largest lead of the night for UVA three speakmen when he drives and draws defensive help hes expert at passing out of it and Jaden Gardner is the beneficiary Shish on 15made baskets for the hoos all know and every shot that Clemson is getting around the basket is over a Defender Virginia doesnt foul very much they make you make a tough two Applause Gardner takes a bump from Hall regathers and finishes it just sticks to the flame right now Clemson is in a tough spot because theyre having a hard time scoring and Virginia has been taking it to him on the offensive end Virginia so crisp offensively in recent minutes theyre just tough it is a tough group Galloway in some traffic has it knocked away Gotta Go Gotta Go Clark doesnt know it didnt know it and they dont get a shot off at the end of the half and he and Clark does so many good things Tony Bennett put his arm around him and give him a little smile I think hell play in the second half yeah boy Virginia other than that finished the half extremely well stretching it out easy basket 50 from the field and Tony Bennett Tony Bennett nonplus by the first half close to perfect not quite perfect up by 12 Holly Rowe got some thoughts from Brad Brownell at halftime well rebounding is an issue for this big strong were getting out rebound because were in rotation then our guards are up against Jayden Garden whos killing us on the glass with five rebounds so he said weve got to do a better job he said our guards cant be the one going up and towards against that big strong kid but thats part of the constant motion right as they get you scrambling thats exactly what it is and and look theyve given up a couple offensive rebounds the problem is youre gonna give up defensive rebounds to Virginia when you missed so many shots and Clemsons gonna have to start making some jobs Clark Applause Franklin into the pace elevates and hits he is having himself a very nice game stays so wide and when Kihei Clark penetrates and hits him then you give up that middle drive and Armon Frankel is not just a shooter hes got a middle game as you said it looks so much more comfortable in this offense than he did a year ago after transferring from Indiana and right away Virginia coming with that post to post double and thats something that Tony got from his dad the great Dick Bennett one of the truly great coaches and great gentleman in the game and Tony comes from a great basketball family you know his uncle jack an outstanding coach now look at Armon Franklin when TA Clark penetrates into the lane and hes got Ian shuffling on him so hes able to get by all of a sudden youre youre having to close out and Franklin drives middle and thats a really nice little jump hook and thats coming from a guard where does the offense come from meanwhile for Clemson scoreless the last four minutes of the first half and still looking to break the ice here in the second oh PJ Hall got the ball right in the middle of the lane but wound up fading away that was just strong defense staying between Hall and the basket by Jaden Gardner a little cross screens for Beekman Applause Brooklyn beautiful feed and another bucket for Gardner boy are they clicking and it was just set up by the shot fade you know Armand Franklin gave a shot fake and all of a sudden Clemsons given up a paint drive that puts you in rotation and the Beautiful drop off 11 now for Gardner and the lead is 16 for Virginia and every cut for Clemson youre having to cut through somebodys chest ball goes into the post they dig it out with the double team theres another double and an Aaron pass the rhythm of Clemson is totally disrupted on both ends of the floor theyre chasing on defense Applause a little hesitation and then drawing Defenders and just threading the needle with that little pocket pass thats just beautiful basketball Applause another great Pass Florida Gardner and what a smile on the face of Jaden Gardner coming back down the court well Clemson getting picked apart in part because theres zero pressure on the ball so Kihei Clark had nothing but vision of everything in front of them because zero pressure on him all Wahoos right now it is an 18 point lead for Virginia looking for a date with Duke in the championship game tomorrow night a lot of alliterations from streaming live on the gsvnn and for those of us who spent their careers playing below the rim its awfully nice to see that view or that that post double has really been effective and every team that plays against Virginia they know the post double is coming what makes Virginias post double particularly effective well they get there quickly and they stay connected so you cant split it and if you dribble out they recover out of it really well but I think we were referring before to Tonys father Dick Bennett uh the great coach was at Wisconsin Green Bay and at Washington State and Wisconsin yeah he wanted to get the ball out of the post nothing good can happen when the balls oneonone in the post and so you double it and rotate out and they they rotate out of it really quickly spin by Gardner double change extra pass Franklin for three and sheplin runs down the rebound is Tony Bennetts coaching at both ends of the floor just kind of a somewhat modernized version of what dick benefits yeah with a lot of the principles I think its more principle based than doing exactly what Dick Bennett did and you know I actually think Tony Bennett would be an outstanding coach in the NBA stand to cook anywhere but my favorite part of of Tony you know obviously his character but you know I think it was a couple years ago they got blown out at Florida State and it was one of those games where coach would go and say that was unacceptable he comes in and says were thankful for the lessons early in the second half try to move into the championship game tomorrow night against the Duke Blue Devils who beat Miami earlier tonight best major conference records over the last six seasons Virginia is our inconference games number one Tony Bennett has won a national championship he has won six outright or shared regular season ACC titles two ACC tournament championships buying for a third this year he has built an unbelievable program the fall movement is just impeccable pearls fade screens flares rescreens and the ball moving to both sides of the floor back and forth and the defense at some point is going to make a mistake Chase Hunter no Shedrick Corrals and here comes Clark that list of teams that Virginia was at the head of that class every team on there had won the National Championship over over that period except for not not over that period but it won the National Championship except for Purdue he certainly is in the conversation this year as Beekman adds to the lead Purdue has not been to a final four since 1980 you know the coach was that year for Purdue Lee Rose Applause Music Shedrick fouled by Middlebrooks and theyre gonna have to take a look at that yeah was that a basketball play and excessive and the signal given by Lee Purcell that they are going to look at it Applause its that right arm just kind of behind Shedrick I dont think its that big of a deal hes making a play on the ball I cant imagine thats going to be a flagrant but you never know Music then Middlebrooks had a terrific game really did a good job Off the Bench against NC State Shedrick looking up at the official right away as if to say what gives Music I had mentioned last night in the game that Clemson played against NC State that Ben Middlebrooks his uncle is Danny Cannell and I made some uh tongueincheek clip about uh Betsy Danny canells not helping Ben with his homework and of course I get a text message from Danny Cannell whos a great guy saying that reminding me that he was academic all ACC when he was a quarterback of Florida State but for him for reminding you yeah well no it was great and but I told him I said its nice that your work with crayons was rewarded that was also a tongueincheek trip no that one though of course of course it was Dannys a fantastic guy and a fantastic broadcaster and his nephews has done a great job at Clemson with Michelle coming over to give us the info upgraded to a flagrant one this is a 192 run for Virginia over the last nine minutes obviously going back to about the last four minutes of the first half it was 2925 Virginia its now 4827 now with the upgrade its two shots on the ball Applause Clemson team that has played so well this year has so many nice wins looks so good last night against North Carolina State and they I mean they hung in even though it felt like they were kind of getting outplayed the first 16 minutes you look up and the scoreboard says theyre right there but man has it gotten away from them yeah Virginia can make you look bad you know we talked about it this is just a rhythm disrupting team and they are clicking offensively with everything they run you know their cuts are crisp and theyre passing excellent a flex action of the out of bounds underneath flexes a continuity offense and Isaac McNeely he doesnt miss many of those Applause consumption certainly has guys who can put the ball in the basket Hull and Tyson and Hunter but easier said than done against Virginia Clark has a great ability to stay in front he gets up underneath you got some foul shot clocks at five Godfrey on the drive tough shot thatll go Applause RJ Godfrey 67 a freshman lots of potential he did a nice job against NC State came off the bench at Four Points a couple of rebounds hes a strong player at six seven you know there was a time and fairly recently when Virginia was not clicking on all cylinders offensively they had very theyre clicking now Reece Speakman just Fades into the corner and then drives it in a terrific slip to the basket by Kaden Shedrick under the Forgotten man but again because of the injury to vanderplas Shedrick is back in the rotation and making a lot of noise Applause and shot fake by Tyson and itll go but getting back to Virginia very narrow wins Over Louisville and Notre Dame in midFebruary lost by 15 at BC only scored 48 points lost it Carolina but over the last couple of weeks they really appear to be rounding into form right now yeah and this is unusual to for Virginia to have in any game a 20point lead theyre not a knockout punch team most of their games are close but they make so many plays down the stretch and winning plays with their guards their guards are mistake free I mean Reese Speakman and Kihei Clark theyre not only second and third in the league and assists but theyre first and second and assist turnover ratio the drive BJ Hall has to come over and then the little pocket pass along the Baseline to Caden Shedrick who just slipped through the basket thats just beautiful offense with Moore heres Holly Road well if youre watching Kate and chedrick the last two games youre like why hasnt he been in the lineup and honestly Tony Bennett had gone to a little bit of a smaller small ball lineup with Ben vanderplas and it started working after that North Carolina game and they started getting better offensively so hes been out of that rotation hadnt done anything wrong nothing the young man did but they just thought they were playing better with the smaller lineup and one of the guys Im talking to about this said look you have to stay encouraged and stay ready and thats exactly what king shedricks done and hes been terrific when his name got called well they lose a shooter and evanderplas they lose one of the great mustaches in college basketball as well but with Kappa and Shedrick theyve still got its a different kind of combo but a very nice combo with the five spot Applause even Drew Timmy would be impressed with that dont you think yeah that is quite a stand I think Ben founder fosss friends had a tshirt made because Ive got one of them with that mustache prominently displayed back screens screen for the screener action off of screen Clark wow I mean Big Time contract and just frustration off so many screens you want to make the screener feel it and the officials will take a look at this they will call the Under 12 timeout right now youll get another look going a break as Jay said screen after screen after screen Music Hunter running into Shedrick just had a look did not upgrade this to a flagrant one thatll be a common foul on Chase Hunter but Brad Brownell frustrated with how things are going and he got teed up so a technical foul on Brownell two free throws coming for Virginia and then it will be their ball as a result of the common foul on Chase Hunter so frustration on the court for the guys in Orange and frustration on the Clemson bench as well Applause and playing Virginia will do that to you especially when Virginias playing as well as they are right now Applause Clark knocks him down Music Applause double figures now for Kihei Clark Applause another illustration of how well Virginias playing at the offensive end tonight theyve got 13 assists to just four turnovers yeah the four turnover is really amazing its a terrific ball control team the only average eight and a half turnovers a game anyway Shedrick will step back for a three this is Dylan Hunter younger brother of Chase Hunter freshman a very talented guy originally committed to Baylor all sizing up Shadrick whos a good shot blocker Applause and a couple of free throws coming for PJ Hall rather nothing but net crew is going to be back at it tonight after this game to break down both of the semifinal games here for the New York Life ACC tournament postgame interviews with a look ahead to the championship game Duke will take on the winner of this one you can see nothing but net tonight on acc Network and the ESPN app Luke Hancock wearing his Ron Burgundy sport coach the most outstanding player of the 2013 the NCAA tournament is listening whats it like to have somebody listen to you must be nice huh sorry you were saying 11 26 to go Virginia by 18 Applause and Clemson will step up the pressure and this is something I would have liked to have seen earlier just to make Virginia take time off the clock sure handed nice try by you though thank you Applause but if you press you know you can press for different reasons you can press to speed a game up to try to force turnovers you can also press to slow a game down and you play Virginia it doesnt matter what you do youre gonna have a slow tempo so if you can slow their Advance you dont have to guard their stuff for as long when they get to the halfway out of bounds to Virginia boy as well as things went last night for the Tigers against NC State and as poorly as theyre going tonight Music oh it takes virginius a while to get it over and they really dont get into anything until about 18 on the clock so now youre not guarding as many screens not guarding as many actions and I think this would have really helped Clemsons defense if Clemson gone to this earlier Big Bear Franklin no but the follow by Gardner well PJ Hall was basically playing a oneman Zone in the middle of the lane but Virginia is just cutting up this defense Chase Hunter the other end for the Tigers we Speakman it was seven assists in the game already and he had a great night last night in the winter of Carolina he can help you win a game so many different ways he doesnt have to score to have a major impact on the game he does so many other things Music Gardner takes a bum from Hall this is the fade away and the rebound down to Godfrey Applause Virginia right now on the four line according to Joe Leonardi and obviously theres room to move with everything going on today tomorrow and in some cases on Sunday before we find out whos in whos out whos going where Turn Around by PJ Hall Clemson fans getting a little noisier but theyve still got a lot of work to do here 16 against Virginia the way the clock runs in their games feels like more than 16 it does feel that way but you get a couple stops couple scores running through Chase under ran through his screen again hes trying to say the screen was moving and the call goes against Hunter of Clemson his third Applause Ryan Dunn will sit Francisco caporo comes back in they might want to think twice before trying to Barrel over him when hes setting the screen or they can try Applause to feel like a crash test dummy if you do that thats a big body out there yeah and he seeks out contact whenever possible Applause gets a touch kicks it out Franklin for three just good basketball get a post touch relocate kick it out Clemson needs to as much movement as they can offensively all the handoff Tyson no and capro down to the rebound rather for the whos Clemson has to go into Quick strike mode but then that puts him into time to possession theyre just running through screens and Hunter Tyson got nailed by a screen hes like finally caparo called for the foul when Francisco capros in the game youre aware of it fifth year player from Argentina Applause sliding a little you didnt think so Applause Galloway to Dylan Hunter and hell knock it down Dylan Hunter made his second three of the season last night now three for 20 on the year from Beyond The Arc just a smart pass there because Kihei Clark was helping off and just couldnt recover in time Applause Gardner fouled on the floor before the shot Applause Music under Tyson the foul his second and number seven on the Tigers so bonus now for Tony Bennetts Virginia Cavaliers Jaden Gardner at the line Caden Gardner may be an undersized big guy at 66 but he is strong and he had 17 points 10 rebounds against North Carolina in this tournament Applause because he is a little bit smaller most players have different they say oh hes got difficulty scoring over length who doesnt have difficulty scoring over length but he creates contact so well to create that little bit of extra space he needs to get his shot off and hes a very good shot maker I remember Kelvin Sampson telling me he was the toughest cover in the league when he was in East Carolina because hes got an amazing first step and a fantastic shot fake in the midrange a short Corner elbow comfortable from a number of different spots the defense by Franklin on Galloway now Hall guarded by capro turn around and its going against Clemson into the RJ Godfrey called for the foul with 7 34 to go in the second half and Virginia seemingly in command here in Greensboro ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is brought to you by New York Life over 12 000 agents there to help guide you through lifes happiest and most difficult times so update Big 12 TCU Texas back and forth well with Timmy Allen out in this game Christian Bishop was going to be that much more important and look at the forceful dunk off the switch Pack 12 UCLA Oregon big second half for the Bruins the difference tiger Campbell was Sensational with the careerhigh 28 points Dan Jay speaking of Sensational coach Bennett in Virginia absolutely right youre a hundred percent right Jordan actual tournament presented by New York Life continuing all week on the ESPN family of networks later on tonight about 13 minutes from now on ESPN big one Arizona and Arizona State the Sun Devils a bubble team looking for a big win UCLA without Jalen Clark but still experience talented tough together still a very dangerous team and anytime a player goes out nobody wants to see Jalen Clark be out for the season hes uh such a great transition player and one of the best defenders in the country a downhill driver that takes the ball right into your chin every time he goes to the basket but Amari Bailey The Talented freshman out of Sierra Canyon High School hes stepping forward and then tiger Campbell is just a winner Reverend Galloway with a three its a 15point game theres still a lot of time in this game I know Virginia eats a lot of time off the clock but its a game where you get a couple stops get a couple scores and the tenor of it can change a little bit because Virginias been playing a lot of this game without any game pressure on him at all got a switch now all on Clark Gardner caparo and a chance for three just beautiful and Jaden Gardner breaks to the high post Clark hits him and because of the angle of the defense theyre able to go high low with caparo Cafaro played that angle really well set the screen then rolls back into the basket got the switch now hes got a little guy on him and he just turns and seals him and gets that high low pass its just and the break to the to the freethrow line by Gardner just made the play and Thats a classic example of what you were talking about before where you would like to see a hockey assist that second decision yeah thats just intelligent basketball really beautiful Applause now a lot of Halls going to give it back to the hoos with 6 29 to go thats three on PJ Hall who is muttering to himself right now its been that kind of a night for the Tigers yeah theres a lot of a lot of muttering and frustration but you know Dan basketball is a game of angles and that was a great example of it that kafaro wasnt open because he was being fronted he wasnt open for the pass from the left wing from Kihei Clark but look at that cut by Gardner she is beautiful but there was no pressure on Kihei Clark and hes just able to pick the defense apart so if youre Tony Bennett youre looking for players for this program and this is a program not a team what kind of attributes are you looking for for guys to run their stuff with as much discipline as this group does High basketball IQ competitive yeah you certainly want guys that can shoot and are very skilled but I think the IQ part of it it has to be the most important factor guys that that understand how to play and are willing to do whats asked of them and you know this is not an easy system to play in good at both ends of the court and theyve been great at both ends of the court tonight and you talked about system and you know doing whats asked of them you cant be selfish and play for this team yeah you you cant go out and try to do it yourself you got to play Within the system yeah and he cant be selfish really anywhere and win selfish doesnt win but you also have to get used to a different style of coaching I was at a practice earlier this year and and Tony didnt didnt like the defensive effort and a lot of coaches would maybe use some colorful language call a name or two and uh and question uh fortitude right and Tony did it by saying thats anemic and then all of a sudden youre thinking about oxygenated blood and what your platelets are doing and but it gets the point across why is Tony wearing a headband in on that tshirt thats an excellent question you never notice there are no tshirts with the faces of bald men on it yeah just a discriminatory thing in our culture thats really really concerning so change that no offense on not a lot of takers Franklin and sheflin down with a rebound for Clemson Applause you know we can feel how we feel and we do we both feel Clemson is a tournament team but Jay its going to be an excruciating 48 hours for them until they find out if they get in at large yeah just because yeah I agree just because all the discussion that goes on with the cottage industry that uh tournament predictions have turned into but and its all great I love it but yeah you gotta be kidding me I mean some of the teams that were talking about in the tournament you prepare their resumes to Clemson then you look on the floor and look tonight its not you know the number one example youd want to use of Clemson as a tournament team I get that but if youve watched this team all year long Clemson can play yeah but the the issue is theyre playing against a team in Virginia Virginia does this to a lot of people they are difficult to play against thats why theyre ranked number 13 in the country and tied to the ACC Championship and again not to assume that this one is over but a 15point lead just over five to go as you can see Joe lunardi right now has Clemson first four out and note the presence of two ACC teams in the last four in NC State and Pittsburgh interesting now when you compare teams you know Head to Head does matter and look I think NC States the term team I think Pittsburghs a term team I have in with with greater ease than that reflects but thats a thats a real gut punch when youre looking at a team that youve beaten three times right you know ahead of you on that list itll all become clear on Sunday barring a big comeback nearby the Tigers its going to be going to feel like longer than a couple of days that they have to wait to find out their fate I love the the committee language thats been developed over the years like right now theyre scrubbing resumes theres a lot of cleanliness in that room Applause what a borax and elbow grease thats how they scrub those resumes Applause bubble teams going at it all around the country then Arizona States one of them playing Arizona starting soon on ESPN I hope Kirk grease is okay with that shoulder as you can see last night where he had to shoot a free throw lefthanded a lot of significant injuries to important players on really good teams the last couple of weeks unfortunately yeah you hope that bill self is back soon hes out for the entire Big 12 tournament and Norm Roberts doing a fantastic job in his absence Applause shot clock at five Clark for three what do you do what do you do take your pH clerk you have a little smile on your face getting back down on defense they have had a great night 13 for Clark Applause the double on Hall and hell head back to the free throw line but time is winding down on Clemson and looking more and more like it will be Virginia taking on Duke J in the chin a very good game a hardfought game against Miami it events down to the final with an 85 to a 78 win over the Hurricanes so that means the next decided youre a coach you watch the second game and it looks like itll be Duke and Virginia this was how the first one went right at the end of regulation originally a foul called the officials went to the monitor said the foul came after triple zeros so no foul so over time Virginia won in overtime later the league so there should have been a foul call but Virginia won in overtime will be a very interesting night between two teams who are playing very very well right now again assuming that Virginia holds on to this lead and takes on the Blue Devils tomorrow night yeah I think both teams are playing substantially better than they did at that time and Duke is a different team offensively than theyve been most of the season its the maturation of that team in the last two three weeks its been really impressive widely a bigger Factor Proctor playing extremely well Whitehead a bigger Factor right now yeah Whitehead getting healthy because hes a weapon out there you know and quietly the guy nobody ever talks about Mark Mitchell just as consistent as anybody in recent weeks for the Blue Devils that Tippin will go I think it was Gardner it was yeah hes had a great night hes got 21 Jay anytime youre ever in a crowd and somebody tips one in you need to raise your hand just on the off chance to get credit for it Tyson saves it but it belongs to Virginia now Tyson the foul and again hes working his tail off he plays hard but boy is is he frustrated they wanted to play basketball one more night here in Greensboro theres some games where its just not your night and I dont think this is reflective of its certainly reflective of how good Virginia is but its not reflective of the quality of team that Clemson is nice night for Armon Franklin thats his 15th point hes just had a great year yeah is that 12 20 point or better games and hes a good Defender he probably doesnt get enough credit for the defense that he plays because he plays with two of the best defenders not only in the league but in the country Speakman and Kihei Clark three speaking of being the ACC Defensive Player of the Year and TJ Clark again first team or all defensive team theres only one one all defensive team all leans in left it short Galloway now challenges Shedrick hall fell over his teammate crashing to the court bodies everywhere and finally a foul call ouch you know in a game like this where both teams are still playing really hard and it seems like the outcome is near decided you know when do you go to the bench you know when does Brad Brownell go to the bench and make sure that PJ hall or Hunter Tyson they dont get hurt the Ovation youre here is for Kaden Shedrick as he is fouled out its been a very important guy for the Cavs the last couple of nights yeah really good minutes against both North Carolina and Clemson active strong protecting the rim and hes really been you know a lot of coaches that call it screener scorer but you set a screen and look to score off that action and oftentimes you know the most selfish thing you can do to get a shot is to set a really good screen you set a really good screen the screener is going to be open most times and obviously with the size the length of Shedrick the size and the strength of capro that comes in handy when youre playing a team as big as Juke is no question you know its not like Clemsons without size right Dukes a little bit more athletic up front Applause Tony Bennett has coached the whos to a couple of ACC tournament championships 2014 2018 the 2014 ones was here in Greensboro Applause nice look Mark misses the three that was almost a look away yeah hes looking toward the freethrow line then kicked it out to the corner well in recent years a whole bunch of different programs have won the ACC tournament in the last 10 tournaments that have been played so we leave out 2020 there have been eight different programs to win in those last 10 years only Duke and Virginia have repeated in that time span theres some good teams on there when you think about it going back to that 2012 Florida State team and one of the best tournaments I mean there have been so many great ones but that 2015 tournament was that Notre Dame won was uh that was a magical few days here Applause that kind of a night for Jaden Gardner hes got 23 points to go with a dozen rebounds yeah he had had a slow period during the middle of the Season where he wasnt scoring and oh he is definitely over that hes been spectacular so who knows how they line up but you could have Gardner going against Kyle filipowski tomorrow in that very interesting matchup well hes played against bigger people a lot Applause and Tony Bennett going to make a couple of Subs what a complete performance at both ends of the court tonight by the Virginia Cavaliers it was cliniclike Music Applause Franklin Now Gardner out Clark out all the starters out and listen to The Ovations and well earned Chase Coleman a senior 510 from Norfolk Virginia into the ball game hes had knocked down a couple threes this season Brad Brownell has made massive substitutions as well and they want to get Coleman a shot they do Applause maybe youll get another chance Applause John C Wiggins freshman from Grayson Georgia number 21 in for Clemson and Coleman down with a rebounds there you go but even when he commented this time for Virginia you got to run the stuff you got to run the stuff McNeely finds Murray in the corner for three well team Murrays is one of 11 for Fleet coming into this game that was an excellent Fade to the corner hes hit two threes in this game one in the first half one in the second Applause Wiggins know and out of bounds Clemson ball with a shot clock reset to 20 no 271 to go Virginia fans on their feet and yes we are in Greensboro but Virginia fans will make their presence fell tomorrow night against Duke Applause Music shot clock running down Godfrey hoists shot clock violation block still running and that is going to do it impressive doesnt do it justice Virginia 76 Clemson 56 and well have the two seed the whos taking on the four seed the Blue Devils tomorrow night and what should be JV a fascinating game with a championship on the line uh two great defensive teams Virginia the
