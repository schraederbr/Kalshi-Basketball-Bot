lower body injury also had an illness Clemson last one 26 games back at 1990 when they won a share of the ACC regular season title something they can still do tonight with a win and a Duke loss to North Carolina there a lot of Hope there theres a lot I think theres hope in in winning tonight I dont know if anybodys taking out d officials Burke Smith Jamal Spearman Kellen milliner and we will rejump Applause there is Ian shefin guarded immediately by lall try Wiggins back in the starting lineup today he had been coming off the bench Dylan Hunter the small lineup theres what Brad Brownell had deployed the last seven games and Wiggins who had one of his best games of the Season against Virginia Tech gets Clemson started we take a look at the starting lineups for Virginia Tech Jaden young 19 per game over his last four Tyler Johnson their best perimeter Defender Ben Hammond lightning quick freshman point guard the starting five for Clemson locking starting with the Duke game where he at 22 has been on a tear Zachary after a slow start to the year shooting it from three 40 plus over his last 15 and a lockin by giving Clemson an early 4 nothing lead so many weapons and when they can play locking on the outside shefin down low they got a high low and the short roll out is there not enough guys to cover lockin and shefin down Music low and Toby laal gets Virginia Tech on the board and that January 25th loss against Clemson lall led the hokes with 14 but was in foul trouble Wiggins Way offline shefin saves it picked off by poti its a good start for both teams so far and Toby Toby lall thats what hes looking to do really in Ser himself early I think thats what you want you you youve got to have rhythm early and Coach young knows this hes got to get this guy in the game find Rhythm and its not just about today its about next week you think about the start Virginia Tech had to the season three and six trying to find some semblance of an alpha you cant say enough about the job Mike young is D this here Zachary to the in for two that is that is not an easy shot he kind of did a little short mini pump fake got the defender in the air and was still found a way to Applause finish theres young he really stepped into his own the last few games especially with Lal D yeah and finding the midrange I me again its one of those things its like people say its a bad shot well its not if you can make a high percentage and get a good look its ever been a bad shot that has gone in no take the good take the best look you can get its midrange so be it blocking against poti Zachary lines up a three and it knocks in just only so much you can do you want to dig down and and help on locking down on the post but you have experienced guys who understand how to relocate to the open spot youre going to get beat Clemsons made four of its first five another turnover thats three already for Virginia Tech there is Chase Hunter leading score winning is pro player in program history locking all alone and a rebound by leall who jumps like a pogo stick he does have that enviable bounce and I can always jump but other guys have bounce hes got that bounce and the three Falls for JD young the sophomore playing his best ball of the Season yeah the wal got 492 in vertical its called Applause humbling hers thinking about it it hers thinking about landingin inside its too easy offensively right now its too easy you got to get pressure on Lock and I I know bigs dont want to come out far but you got to pressure the ball otherwise the high low is just going to wear everybody down on the post because she does a good job get position there is PO he stripped turnover number four hunter in the late January game against Virginia Tech only scored two points only played 10 minutes Miss fires he had the flu didnt come into the game until Midway through the second half theres Johnson weaving no and lock in CS Applause lock and puts it on the floor taken away young steps into it rims out got a good little flow to the start of this game every time we get through the under 16 without a stoppage I love it both teams have a chance to find the game as we get one right now yeah you jinxed it John that was on me Clemson five of eight in the early going Jaden Zachary with five on senior night the Tigers lead by four Music Applause Music Applause early remember earlier when I said you were coming in low whatever Mike was picking you up thats what we were hearing then it got loud for a second the button got stuck yeah no I hear you fine I like I I got if youre talking to me great I dont need to hear you guys talking to each Applause other no no problem were Applause Applause good the some your Applause Applause Applause relation Applause Music Applause Music Applause a Music Applause Music Ro John Christen one of those Seasons where you mentioned a pun F under the radar in the ACC partly because yes the league is down Duke has also been otherworldly dominant you tend to forget Clemsons been pretty dominant during this run 25 and five but going into the final game of the regular season and I think we we fall victim to narrative sometimes and and if the ACC is perceivably down yeah what does that mean to me it means that good teams that are not typically your highlevel basketball programs like a Duke North Carolina Virginia good teams are often overlooked so so I think its the other way around its not that theyre they may not be this good I think theyre better than people think they are because were thinking the ACC as being down this Marshall determined Music sheon posting Burnham young came over to Applause help we welcome those of you who watched SMU and Florida State Little John Coliseum it is loud it is rock as here at least it was until we started talking a moment ago and hepped John Chris for you the tigers with a win today with tie a school single season record for victories with 26 it has been the best regular season in program history for Clemson as Burnham hits the turnaround meanwhile for Virginia Tech they have come a long way after a rough start to the season it speaks to the job Mike young has done and the hokes with a win today would get the ninth seed in the ACC tournament that comes with a first round by well G Tech tried to find what Clemson has and thats continuity continue to build on experience and if Mike young gets guys for multiple years in a row he will Coach them up and they will be a high level competitive basketball team we got a young group right now and hes done a very good job with this group not a lot of experience not a lot of production by any of these Virginia typ players coming into the season as we get a whistle I was thinking about it too senior night like theres some senior nights where you got some you know some oneyear mercenary and they get a they get an honorary Jersey but this is different like Chase Hunter and Ian shefin have played 293 games together here that is wild that that doesnt exist anymore so I think this is something you should celebrate this group definitely a little bit of a somber feel knowing that youre not going to see those guys anymore and I think thats ultimately what what made college basketball great was you knew who your team was year in year out and you build upon that and now you have the season that happen and now after every season you hit reset you blow in the cartridge yeah you open up the Applause checkbook heres Brandon re Steiner his dad the famous wrestler Scott Applause Steiner Jaden young 19 a game over his last four rexin are a three hes been slumping over for 10 over his last two plus score forson you go with wrestler or Entertainer F yeah yeah miles Foster into the box score he didnt play the last two games I go with athlete Entertainer I think thats fair sorry back to basketball Applause Music Jaden shoot over to Burnham taken away heres D Jones and he is blocked and fouled by burnam at The Rim Al Jones The Freshman at his best game of the season in late January against Virginia Tech Chase Hunter limited to 10 minutes due to an illness he comes off the bench scores a career high 13 you watch this Clemson team defensively they they stay in position so they dont have to gamble theyre in position to take one two steps to get into a passing Lane so their position defensively is ultimately what allows them to create turnover opportunities tonight 630 Eastern on ESPN its the featured game in the ACC one of the featured games in college basketball it always is Duke at North Carolina in the Sonic Blockbuster if the Blue Devils win they lock up the one seed and the AC tournament and the regular season title if Carolina wins that means Clemson Louisville and Duke would share the regular season title the Tigers would end up as the number two seed in the ACC tournament and that scenario Clemson can slip to no worse than three just go ball whoever you got to play you got to play him ultimately I think everybody feels like you got to beat Duke nobodys been able to do that in the ACC except Clemson Duke is one of those teams that its just a tough matchup and I dont care if you play small ball and super fast or youre big and compound it doesnt matter they can match up either way they can still play the way they want to play Carolinas gotten a lot better obviously six wins in a row they scored 93 points a game over that stretch figured out how to play small PRs experience is is ultimately what gives them such an edge Duke though seven wins in a row all by an average of 30 plus they were essentially turned their opponents into Alder around Duke is so good right now that they make a blowout worth watching I do cuz you just appreciate it unless youre not a Duke fan I guess thats right well Im sure theres a few you should appreciate it though you think the folks in Chapel Hill appreciate probably not Zachary hbor Jones again the aggressor that is tough that that is a bad angle but got to the paint and just soft touch up on the rim good action to get that ball into the paint six points for dill Jones Burnham in trouble turns it over seven turnovers by the hookes hi breeder all the way to the rim he was almost unsure of what to do he looked like he didnt want it there for a moment he was kind of like help help good pump fake and Applause finish ripped away Kobe lall back after missing the last two games hrer open this place was ready to erupt thats good stuff though I mean Clemsons moving it well they find out where they have the advantage they had it down low throw it inside lockin realized he had a better shootter out them on the wing and passed it out Tyler Johnson momentarily quiets the crowd clss good ball movement and then their understanding of one another allows them to operate to a point where they find what works for them they find a match up they like they get the spacing they like and theyre able to attack but they do it with Music patience shot clock inside of Music 10 Jones has been Catalyst Off the Bench that is a heat check locking on cleanup Duty the worst misses always favor the offense so an air because its not coming off the rim youre timing it as a def to get your body into the offensive player root out make some room and read the ball off the rim Steiner with that basket and an 0 for 10 slump he just needs to create a little rhythm into a shot could come off the bounce cuz the bounce does it for you the bounce creates Rhythm into the Applause shot Zachary locking backing down the wall and the tip in on the second effort thats good he he is really improved hes improved down low but hes also improved around the perimeter to the point where when sheins in theyre playing high low with Victor Victor Lock and 25 ft from the basket we have 22 in the Duke since then hes averaged 16 a game Burnham too strong rebound to Jones now the last piece of Brad brell has said this now Clemson gets a little consistency from its bench with the starters and the experience they have guys like Zachary and Chase Hunter and lockin and chefin all of a sudden theres a lot of fail safes and this team might be able to check off boxes over the next month that its never checked before I I I would agree I I think all the pieces are in place particularly if you have guys that understand how to play the game that was established by the starting five its very important that your starting five establishes the way the games going to be played and the guys coming in are paying attention so they can build off of it not slow it down three starters at the scores table locking Applause flush everything seems to be working on the offensive end for Clemson theyre just picking this Virginia set defense apart high low pick and roll pick and short roll its all been there Victor locking the recipient of an easy Music one experience and you see it on the offensive end but you also see it in the Buy in on the defensive end the anticipation the positioning they never get behind the play experience yes but man theyre getting out in passing Lanes crit forcing seven turnovers eight points off those turnovers Clemson has dictated the way this games going to be played starting on the defensive end and inside Virginia Tech has basically played Subway Turn Style defense 20 of Clemson 27 points in the painted area make it 22 of 29 yeah thats like painted area adjacent but I think it should count they are just getting where they want to go its been remarkable defensively theyve been stifling on the offensive end Clemsons just been able to operate and pick this for gch defensive part potit almost turned it over but we get a foul on Clemson it is hi breeder its his first team second Tigers already out to a 15point lead on senior night little John put your hands together as your take for the final time this season Applause ladies gentl Applause Music lets see the work Music Applause Applause right thank you the ladies with the lets take a look over the board check out the GS our friends at United m Music Applause Music la Music you ever see the more cowbell Saturday Night Live Christopher walk thats Clemson season every time they put their jerseys on Gold Records platinum records its been a historic season 25 and five the school record for most wins in a single season 26 back in 90 technically the NCAA vacated two of those wins but the wins actually did happen so a win today Clemson would have 26 wins theyve got the best ACC record theyve ever had 172 win percentage as of now program record and for a charter member of the ACCC Clemsons never won its Conference tournament in the ACC theyre going to have a great chance to do that this year year theyre the only team to beat Duke and for a team thats never gone to a final four they have all the ingredients to make that run as well all that is ahead yeah I I think theyre the only team that can match up against Duke and kind of dictate the way the games played as theyre doing right now uh I would also say they have what everybody wants in college basketball which is experience and continuity its whats lost in the game right now as we have these one twoyear teams with yeartoyear free agency I mean you have got again 293 games between two players that is unbelievable Chase Hunter a sixthe senior one in white winningest player in program history Chef Linn a fouryear guy whos gotten better and better every season accs most improved a year ago heres Hunter step back three and its chased down by Burnham all right for Virginia Tech they need a win today to get one of those first round buys although you might be able to argue a first round buy and a second round win gets you quarterfinal date with Duke so is that the most desirable thing next week dont no I mean really its not bad either to play games and kind of as I say find a rhythm especially as the seasons winding down you you play fearlessly you play play with more hope and less concern theres po good touch gets the bounce and again thats not a done deal thats assuming Duke beats Carolina that would give the blue Devils the one seed in the ACC tournament should North Carolina win Louisville would be the one seed Duke would then fall to three Clemson with win would be the two Applause Music seed young got away with a push off iron sides a three whats the path back into this game for attch well first something you got to get stops you got to find a way to just be disruptive on the defensive end they havent really been able to disrupt or keep the ball to one side or keep it out of the paint and then you have to continue to operate on the offensive end theres poti getting a hand in the passing Lane but again you still have to defend Wiggins Baseline turnaround no a Virginia Tech are shooting 50 problem is seven of 14 offset by nine turnovers yeah thats thats a issue it also keeps you from developing something like I keep saying Rhythm but really just developing a good feel for how you can operate offensively against this prson Applause defense potit with five theres the double by Hunter and turnover number 10 I like that delayed double cuz it it its really on the bounce and turn when you bounce it and they dig down hard the first thing you do as a big is typically pick it up bigs rarely get to the retreat dribble something Hunter Dickinson at Kansas finally got starting to get better at where you wait you wait you Retreat dribble out of it bring two with you create the advantage with the double team but the second that ball gets put down on the floor and its a hard dig down you just pick it Applause up one of the matchups that favored Clemson tonight Virginia Tech has struggled with turnovers all season clemon amongst the best in the ACC at turning their opponents over but not even doing it with pressure just doing it with good position shot clock at six Rob to shein speaking a great position he had it overshot the rim he just didnt have balance SK low maybe a power Tribble against l knock back by Hunter coming our way I had that John you had it you had it I trusted the athletes on the floor he chose wisely so than than the adonises over Music here off the scramble The Hustle by Jaden shoot thats what youve seen from Virginia Tech they continue to fight they dont have bad body language even when they struggle shoot passed on three Hammond stepped out of bounds thats like such a thing this year the amount of times guys step out of bounds on the sideline and and the answer like the the typical answer in our world today is will make the court bigger its like no figure it out the Courts been this size for a long time figure it out the difference is now were trying to create more space on the floor so guys and kind of almost inherently just get wider get they move the lines back all the way into the corner and he like an e gr that time to adjust a dozen turnovers in the first half and thats been the culprit so far plaguing Virginia Tech what also puts you in a position where when you turn it over even if Clemson doesnt score youre chasing the play and the whole idea of good offense is to create a Chase if you can do that by getting a steal getting up running and flowing into your offense you have the advantage foul was on wesler Reeds too easy great high low with the guard he he waited held ball fake got two Defenders up good Music offense W Miss Rees carals Here Comes Zachary up ahead to Hunter and its turned Applause over last three and a half minutes Virginia attack with three turnovers hson has been switching and closing quickly the wall poed that one up itll stay with Virginia Tech switching closing quickly but again positioning means you dont have to over rotate they are right there the rotation are clean and crisp its a really good Clemson team I think we got to talk them up allem your I need a little more you little John a little more there you go the you go Mele if I have ever seen one pretty good good thats what Im talking about creativity right there everybody thats the winner in my but there can only be one let me see you little job let me see your Applause Music best all right were scanning for the best were scanning for the best Max flow tiger Applause Can Only Winners know who it is us your you know how to do Applause Music guitar tomorrow morning the womens game day crew will be at the well in green South Carolina at noon Eastern 900 am Pacific to get you set for six Title Games if youre wondering John why you couldnt get a hotel in the area SEC womens tournament taking place up the road in Greenville yeah that was a problem now it makes more Applause sense I mean I got over it pretty quickly I think this place is awesome I love coming down here love to come down for a football game some time like I feel like that would be epic so just so you know at the end of the game dont make the mistake as re Steiner hits an open three dont make the mistake of saying they Rush the field after the game they gather at the Paw doesnt matter if theyre playing Florida State on Saturday night where the Connecticut school of broadcasting at newon yeah I wouldnt do either I I would just sit there and watch just take it all in I dont need to participate in the madness just like to say I was there thats it sipping a umbrella drink in a sweet somewhere its more my speed wonder if anybody has a sweet Applause available hang around town long enough yeah right there comes Zachary four to shoot locking with two hes got to put it up and thats a shot clock violation theres your defensive stand yeah but but to me some of thats on Zachary you have to know if you give it up you have to tell Victor loan that theres 4 seconds on the clock and just say shoot it Music Applause Zachary the accs active leader in steals Here Comes lean hell get two shots I just love unlock him he he gets that that ball kind of a short roll good pause and just elevates takes the contact still gives it a chance on the rim like hes a fun watch highlight waiting to happen yeah but but even throughout the course of a normal game hes just a fun watch there theres just an explosiveness there that at any moment something big could happen it speaks to what Mike young has done over the years in developing his players La last year at VCU averaged less than eight points again hes become an alpha on this team and early in the season Virginia Tech was looking for that goto guy it ended up being L and the more they get into their movement and their continuity offens offensively they create space and in that space they create options lock all alone hes got 10 its amazing how easy it is when you have five weapons on the floor that know how to play with one another for one another someones going to be open got four seniors and the Freshman Dell Jones as Virginia Tech commits its 13th turnover its just easy stuff I mean just kind of underneath on the Baseline you dont Trail just too easy look at all the space on the right side of the floor theres really no ball pressure not enough room to to even get help over there Clemson just one for nine from three but shooting 66 inside the arc last Saturday against Virginia they won that game by double digits after going one for 10 for three battle on the board lockin rips it away and that gets the Applause right back to lockin against the smaller re Steiner and a dozen for the big Russian he is passionate about that one good body control too redin did a good job holding his ground there typically been that was that was my role just kind of stand your ground as a little guy 10 to shoot po sets the screen rall has to put it up looking for help 14 turnovers to just eight made field goals in the first half for the hookies yeah they just they just did not know how much time was was left on the clock not paying attention to the fact that the clocks running down Applause Applause about a sixc differential on the clocks Hunters been quiet in the first half Rex Steiner Virginia Tech had fouls to give re Steiner commits his first good clean game to start too like what do we have 6 minutes straight before the first timeout another 5 minutes after that we have a good pockets of flow which is all thats what I ask for in basketball right go to four quarters youre going to find that a little bit better its hard to find it in the half with timeouts every four minutes great good pockets of flow and a timeout by Brad Brownell now speaking of flow whats been impressive about Clemson and weve seen it all season its not one guy Chase Hunter their leading scorer scoreless it hasnt mattered Tigers lead by 15 Music Applause Music Applause Applause Music Clemson on senior day looking to put an end point on the best regular season in school history highest win percentage most conference wins theyve beaten Kentucky theyve beaten Duke the only ACC team to beat Duke and you see the experience pop up all over especially when they dont play at Little John they wanton H straight road games hard to do doesnt matter what league youre in yeah mean experience is ultimately continuity on the floor and continuity on the floor means like we know who we are day in day out we understand who the opponent is we just know how to get the best out of ourselves regardless of the opponent final 10 seconds Hunter with a point crimsons leading score and fouled by Rex Steiner his second only the teams fifth now you got to look at something at The Rim keep an eye out for just a a toss up at The Rim or a little action on a screen he lock and roll into the basket and Tech still has one more foul to give theyre looking to use that around the perimeter but some may open up at The Rim Jones to inbound Hunter catch and shoot it comes to Hammond and the first half comes to an end that did not count holy smokes he just trained that caught in the switch that that really doesnt favor them and the experience of this Clemson group knows how to seek out the best opportunity play to their advantage Clemson has already secured a double Buy in the ACC tournament Virginia Tech with a win would get the nine seed which is the last first round Music by Hond gets it back from lall and gets a little Serendipity good little inside out they got the Dig Down on lity he was able to kick that thing back out ham gets it to go good start to the second half freshman had a career high 21 last Saturday and the overtime win against Syracuse Applause Music Chase hunter scoreless in the opening half finding lock and whos got 14 to lead all scores Chase Hunter is the kind of guy where his body language isnt going to change just cuz hes not scoring you hes going to continue to operate on the offensive end right theres case in Applause point left it short Here Comes Hunter ahead to Zachary rims out shein kept it alive and Johnson the best perimeter Defender for the hokes pokes it Music Applause away the wall into the body of lockin and he traveled almost turned it over proba been a break there for Virginia Tech that would have been a live ball turnover you also you also youre going to say that a lot when you watch Clemson play defense into the body and its typically into the body of a secondary Defender whos in position to get there quickly and just cut off whatever driving lane you thought was there Im going to say it a lot I think the positioning defensively for Clemson is what stands out to me the most where does that come from is that coaching is it experience is it continuity uh D all the above right and you got to play together to understand each other you got to communicate youve got to be willing to be coached which this group clearly is Young theres Zachary the accs active steals leader Hunter with his first two on senior night winningest player in program history six years all with Clemson thats a modern day unicorn in college basketball young Depot Zachary almost stole it away and Johnson has that roll off Lins just really just disruptive at The Rim got to get shots off over the top he doesnt look to block a ton but hes there out of bounds to Virginia Music Applause Tech talk about Zachs defensive prow being able to get steals I mean thats just great hands give me that and an easy one for Chase Hunter who has struggled to get it going offensively I just I dont think we may talk about hey hasnt really gotten much going off I dont think he cares and there have been games like that all season where he has not been other number one score hes been below 10 points and they find somebody else whether its shefin or Zachary of blate lockin both these teams are like that Ian Virginia T had it 10 guys or so dont count well be with a nice move on locking like his game too its kind of a good match up for him so long as he gets position gets lock and on his back he hes got skills in the post and that first meeting between these two Hunter plays 10 minutes saddled with the flu doesnt come into the game until Midway through the second half only scores two points and Clemson wins by 15 Hammond tried to take it away from lockin and they get lockin for his second foul I feel like the second half has picked up physicality wise and and that happens a lot when both teams create good flow in the first half and they they dont foul much its almost as if you have fouls to give to the point where youre willing to be a little bit more aggressive particularly if youre the team thats down its been a uh chippy start choppy start physical start for a second half I dont like the word chippy why not I think its just overused its like everybody talking about their culture now were just adding to Music it another steal by Applause Clemson Zachary earlier this year struggled to shoot it from three first 15 games below 30 last 15 43 he found out who he was with this group and just got to play again sometimes just have to play games sheflin strong to the 10 plus one I dont think he got 5 in off the ground it is all about body control just feeling the contact you feel the contact you understand Elevate know exactly when I need to get that thing off slight Flex they love him here I I mean I I cant say it this this enough dudes that stay around for four years find a home right like they find a home to the point where they could come back at any time and they are a legend 5 10 years from now theres going to be a kid in the stands with the chef hat theres a bunch behind us and again hes a fouryear guy all with Clemson so when he comes back hes going to be a legend legend I mean it almost goes without saying doesnt he have to open up a restaurant in Clemson at some point come on make it a diner too Im a breakfast guy Jersey guys we like diners Diner Im thinking Chef Michelin star bring it to South Carolina sure he has access to a few Music donors Jaden Youngs three no follow the wall no Foster rips it Applause Music away sheins got a mismatch down low Foster puts it on the floor and a nice move down low he was a double digit score the last two years at Illinois state in Mon its just really good patience and shefflin did a good job of vacating that that left block to get to the right to clear space for that play to happen sometimes the best things you could do as a big as get out of the Applause way rson with its largest lead of the game at 19 Johnson kicks to Burnham shot fake lines it up no good and a rebound by Applause Foster zacher Wiggins the trailer shefflin kept it alive knocked out of bounds Applause Clemson man just starting to pull away you just feel it its a team that plays with great confidence they understand how to help one another on the floor and for sheflin that just meant make room get out of the way Music youre watching the ACC on ESPN with John Chrisman and E Ro here at Little John Coliseum UFC 313 tonight in Las Vegas highlighted by the light heavyweight title fight and Justin gais return to the Octagon prelims begin at 8 Eastern by Pacific on ESPN news and ESPN Music plus I absolutely love the chef hats my favorite thing we may have to get you one before we leave no Hunter throws it up toward the rim lall the rebound I just love that hes celebrated you know CU its a guy thats given more of the program than hes probably taken its lost in this landscape isnt there something about being able you know to have a true Alma moer and to go back as Burnham hits the shot know years from now when Chase Hunter and Ian sheflin come back to Little John they will be celebrated other guys who were here for a year and play for for four different schools theyre mercenaries they are what they are yeah and I I understand it I understand the professionalism of this game right the professionalism of amateous sports its happening at younger ages too but at some point we got to well figure out what works and Ill tell you what what Clemsons doing Works therell be a balance at some point well is it sustainable for what Clemsons doing or the wild west that is college basketball what Clemsons doing to have this kind of continuity you know its suain its sustainable in the sense that it may be a year or two off after a successful run like this but I think theres a framework for it I think what Dukes doing theres a framework for that where you you have great talent coming in and then you surround that great talent with good role players the right guys not just the right players the right people BR Brownell has said so many times throughout the course of the season to me that the players police the culture you dont have to worry about resetting your team culture I know that word that you hate thats overused as Rex Steiner hits the three I dont hate it when they actually have it when you have it like otherwise there are a lot of times you talk about culture and its just a cliche and usually my responses will Define that like what does that mean to you most teams struggle to do that through the course of a season when you have a new roster how do you have identity thats consistent culture thats consistent without having the same players and the culture is consistency that thats the its just what it is it helps to have a a guy like Chase Hunter all four of his points in the second half Jones calling for it instead Foster he gets tied up held ball possession arrow Applause Clemson I think part of your culture too is represented by your best players and theres a selflessness to that which kind of establishes the culture of this Clemson program the culture of Houston is a lot different right the culture of the Houston program a lot different right but its consistent with Kelvin Samson its consistent with who he is and yeah thats that simple graphic says a lot all four have played together at least three years and they all play 20 plus minutes per game finally a whistle Clemson rewarded for the aggression on the glass I think the other piece of that is that they they know one another and knowing one another is far more than just knowing who you are and what youre capable of on the basketball court knowing one another is understanding your social Tendencies just as much as your basketball tendencies that makes you better on the basketball court miles Foster to the foul line ACC Tournament begins Tuesday at the Spectrum Center in Charlotte they have been aching for some quality basketball I wish the Hornets were better first round games coming for you uh coming your way on acc Network on Tuesday pregame coverage tips with the nothing but net crew at 130 Easter all right outside of The Usual Suspects Duke Louis and obviously Clemson who can win the ACC tournament thats feels like a real long shot to pick Eddie wol oh then burn him look out called him Bo bur hes hilarious that guy I mean wake maybe I mean outside of that its hard to say anybody lock in Wild shot I do feel like wake is a team with great experience that that could turn it on that theyre not going to be able to play fast but they could operate and win some games think Carolina is dangerous too be inter to see what they do T right Burnham misfires kept Alive by poti shoot has it knocked Away by locket shot clock at five poti stolen away by hiy breeder and a foul along the sideline hi breeder gets that ball cuz hes in position theres still good things happening for Virginia Tech I talk about good Body Language they continue to fight Ben Burnhams Boses brother still in the Music Music fight line over the next week uh you get a four seed a three seed theyve never been higher than a four seed in their programs history again could be a special mark for Clon fans I think theyre a really dangerous team in March we think about teams that can get out and score a lot but teams that can defend and disrupt that way with a solid strong simple base defense a lot of the turnovers that theyre creating are really just because of their base de and the big guy in the middle locking it started with those two games against Duke in Carolina when he had 22 AP piece he has carried that momentum been a different player over the last seven eight games I think hes found the game right and its not that hes found it that now everybody has to adjust to him he did a good job of adjusting to the players around him and figuring out what his role is and and found out a way to maximize his role also you you think about the guys air Sims PJ Hall guys that came before him good ball movers around the perimeter good Shooters really inverts the defense a lot where youre pulling that big away it just challenges your defensive principles in ways that its hard to simulate I had one ACC assistant coach tell me in some ways locking gives you you more to think about than a PJ Hall the ability to not only score inside outside but his ability as a screener and passer PJ Hall was a great play great play I love deir Sims too just the way they played with him inside out inside out ball always went through him at the top of the KY it just challenges everything you do as a defense that a terrific passer for a big guy Jaden Young comes up short foul on Clemson the key with bigs too is that you dont have to be a great passer but you cant be a ball sticker right when the ball comes your way it cant stick like thats what kills the the Rhythm and the fluidity of of a tough Applause Music Applause offense Dylan Hunters first foul Jaden Music Young wesler on the follow I know he missed that time but Jaden Young is again one of these pieces that Mike young yes can build upon going into the next year when lets be frank hes going to have more nil money hes going to have more resources I think people have found an appreciation for how good of a coach Mike young is with what hes been able to do start to finish with this roster I mean basketball wise he hes one of the best coaches out there the longer he has guys to better theyre going to be that thats just matter of fact and youll be a better basketball player because of the time you spent with him and yeah the nil I drives me nuts to say it but yeah its going to help its going to help him keep the players that he wants to come back and then youre going to build off that as your core and Surround those guys with the right people here comes Burnham shoot open track down by Dylan Hunter Applause Zachary tough Runner locking kept it alive it comes back to Zachary wide open three Wiggins to follow Zachary had to shoot that they make him run if he passes up wide open thre but what what did I say about air balls air balls always favor the offense the defense is looking for it to come off the Applause rim shoot the Duke transfer no good Wiggins is there hes really struggled to find it terms of shooting the basketball hes getting good looks great ball movement Wiggins front rim its amazing cant make it three yet theyre getting whatever they want in the p Music pain I dont think they sweat it either no theres no bad body language from Miss threes Rex Steiner has one rattle in re Steiner has the ability to be pretty tough I I mean develop as a score be strong with the ball dont turn it over those are simple things you can do you think of sha padul and what he was able to do his biggest challenge was taking care of the basketball and shot selection a part of that last year was he had to take tough shots Ste by Rex Steiner pull up three love it in and out offensive rebound burnam shoot quick throw inside wesler hesitated over locking for two I really like I like his work down low he really wanted to get back to that right shoulder left hook but he kind of conceded and finish with the right hand in front of the rim thats good stuff from Wesley Brad Brownell calls it time out Okies have closed to within 13 they have trailed by as many as 19 this has been a fun game all the way around just watching this Clemson team operate yeah air ball whos looking up everybodys looking up for it to come off the rim Wiggins just catches the airball and finish Music Applause Music Applause Music Applause Music Applause Music Applause Music wheres wheres Applause Music Applause Music Applause Clemson finds different ways to win last Saturday at Virginia they go 1 for 10 from three doesnt matter they dominate in the paint similar story tonight and they get what they want thats the thing and youre not making threes a lot of times you dont make threes you see it in the body language they start to mope a little bit you start to feel it you you press a little bit but when youre solid defensively you can play fearlessly and freely on the offensive end I think thats what a lot of this comes down to is they trust what they can do on the defensive end they trust one another they trust if they space the floor and play with one another theyre going to get open looks either way and today its been a quiet offensive game from Chase Hunter quiet game from sheff Wiggins another open three this one goes its like they heard when we were talking about theyve gotten good looks thats the thing too like I have a term I know this first time we work my term is clappable Miss like the clappable Miss is a good look that you got that you build off of you dont worry about the fact that it didnt go in theyve gotten a lot of clappable Misses its probably why the body language is good because you love cliché so much trust the process trust the process yeah phly got we had a lot of process in Philadelphia for a few years lall no the shot clock winding down yeah we were told to trust the process for I dont know six seven years and they just kept drafting 7f Footers I think we lost faith in the process there now embiid injured again Hunter fouled by Hammond Applause Music entering today Joe lardy forecasted three ACC teams in his projected field Duke Louisville and clemon North Carolina began the day as the first team out and then you have wake and SMU a little further out both of those teams won today Carolina and Duke taking place right now step aside 638 to go in regulation Applause all the Chefs Kitchen came out on senior night we remind you not far just up the road in Greenville in South Carolina the womens game day crew will be at the well to get you set for six conference Title Games highlighted by these three on Applause Music Applause ESPN Zachary put in Kelly you heard that right put in mat Kelly you got the fans behind us you just clamoring for the walk on John you played this kind of G as the wall shows the Hops you saw that coming didnt you Biometrics good job good good job by the playby play guy laying out for a highlight that was spectacular but yeah I love the point youre making in terms of getting the walk ones in the game you you got a bunch of experienced guys on the floor we know what they can do now can they put it away to the point where you can get everybody a chance to be a part of this cuz its not just a part of this game its a part of this season and what this season represents to this program this place this place is packed great crowd youre probably going to get good crowds from Clemson in Charlotte if youre Virginia Tech youre thinking get this to under 10 before this 4minute media timeout Johnson down low fighting deflected it stays with the hokes only one to shoot I mean this thing happen fast and when that ball gets thrown up you you almost just have to get out of the way no ones getting above Toby lall he was a young man who was banished from the soccer field at his school in England needed a new sport found basketball and um you basketball found him too recorded 49 and A2 in F I mean after 40 in you stopped counting half Ines just call it 50 for crying out loud hes just a remarkable athlete hes been one of the breakouts players in the ACC he can jump into the stratosphere and he speaks with a British accent Music Applause Music Applause Music Applause Music Applause Music oh Virginia Tech has been climbing uphill most of the evening if youre Mike young and youre saying if theres going to be a chance here 521 plenty of time left where do you want to get this deficit to before we get to that under four media timeout look you can think about getting it to 10 I think thats kind of that sweet number that helps though oh the wall had that one thats a shot clock violation right idea throw it to the guy who jumps higher than anybody else that was there I think he just kind of lost sight of the ball and went to dunk it before he caught it but the reality is you got you got to take advantage of quick hitter opportunities if youre Virginia Tech get into Quick hitter options so you can get a quick shot opportunity cant take too much time just just trying to operate 21 turnovers for the hes Applause Music Wiggins got the start today after coming off the bench the last seven Music games lockin shows off the passing ability and then hunter gets bumped by Hond say that thats the challenge when youre going up against Clemson youve got if your Virginia attch G quick hitters on the offensive end which means a quick action to get a shot or a shot opportunity cuz youre going to have to face this this offense for Clemson for 30 seconds operate and they probably live at the free throw line down the stretch next foul by the hokes puts Clemson in the Applause bonus it will stay with Clemson chony Wiggins thought it went off the foot of Chase Hunter was walking back toward the defensive end Zachary cork screws inside Up and Under yes what a contortionist to be able to get his body kind of turned and put a little English on that thing a blocking foul on Zachary I dont know how thats a block but either way Zachary going to the basket he had no room really to get there he had no room to get to the basket he kind of got under wesler right hand spin it a little bit theres nothing there right its a tough Applause finish only three team fouls on Clemson maybe thats why it was a Music Applause choke Hammond wants the screen from wesler Young in the paint over lock in got it thats tough finish kind of got that left hand out little off arm just a protect the SWAT these TP Youngs going to be really good had some big games of late 27 at Miami 26 last Saturday in the win against Syracuse Zachary midrange jumper sweet its a twom man game AC lockin does a good job rolling taking the guy with him good patience simple shot I know people dont really like that shot I love it 11 for Zachary Rex Steiner on the bench for Virginia Tech hes their leading scorer also with 11 blocking leads all scores with 16 and jump ball possession arrow to Virginia Tech three and a half left in this one Clemson on senior night up by 16 Music Applause Music Applause Music Applause Applause BL Applause Music Applause Music B two for Applause S its been a packed house at Little John theyre celebrating the Clemson Music seniors and on senior night it hits differ for programs these days in the transfer era Victor lockin spent three years in Cincinnati hes a transfer Jaden Zachary came over from DC but for guys like shefin and Chase Hunter who took part in this a year ago these are core Guys these are Clemson guys now and forever at this point its now 295 games that these guys are 296 games I guess they played together thats thats insane its just remarkable or combined I should say now Virginia Tech lost track of the shot clock 22 turnovers out of a timeout thats a Mike young head scratching sometimes you look back and you say didnt we just talk about that hes got some Growing Pains now but Im telling you both these coaches are are similar in this way that if they have guys with experience that they can actually coach they will get better and by the time theyre theyre experienced together the continuity is there these are both going to be good Applause Music Applause progress shefin offensive rebound and a foul and in shefflin to the free throw line Clemson in the bonus he start the rookie head obviously for Clemson poised to make a Deep Run in March brout Brownell Assuming hes back at Clemson next year will be the longest 10 coach in the ACC Mike young next year goes into season 7 and its this new age now oh beheim gone Roy Williams shy Mike Bray and then this year Tony Bennett Leonard Hamilton Jim Lena Rick patino whos kind of the first one to Le the league after 20100 wins between those guys thats Applause insane you dont you got to understand what it takes to get 300 which is a remarkable feet as a head Music coach po that Coach K had 12200 Mike young picked up Milestone win number 400 earlier this year Applause Music 16 points for lock in Chef turned away by burnam good defense I think another thing to say about both these coaches that theyve proven that they could win with less right less perceivably less Talent they can coach them Applause up Clemsons going to be a great litness test over the next month on the value of continuity yes and experienced guys who have played together yeah and Id like to see what that is in the NCA tournament you know youre playing against these familiar opponents in the ACC its hard to really gauge that they know you as well as anybody else I want to see them outside of the conference cuz I think thats where that continuity matters the most thats where experience wins the most Zachary to the line after a couple of pump fakes on Johnson the other thing is coaches get to know their teams sooner in the season when you have this team where you put a bu guy and here come the walk on this is best place going to go I should just shut up and let these guys have their time this is special three senior WalkOns along with Dylan Hunter check in Andrew latiff Matt Kelly and Daniel NSI you got to understand what these guys represent for this team in the in the stands theyre applauding and they think its cool the reality is these guys do as much if not more than the guys that play 30 plus minutes a game they are dedicated to making your team better this is a special special moment Chase Hunter Ian shefin come to the bench hugs with the players the coaches that chase Hunter is somebody if Clemson makes another run here in March yeah he might have his jersey in the rafters one day six years at one place is its only been done in the Applause NBA and thats Rarity these days into the box score tracking down the Reiner miss this place will explode if one of the walkon score Music Lati now Kelly lost it out of bounds you could watch the excitement bubbling on the Clemson bench I the other thing is as an opponent you do not want to give that basket up a lot of these guys get points by being foul because the opponent doesnt want to let you score Music Applause Music Applause Music westler almost fell out of bounds knocked away NS tried to save it out of bounds to Tech eight to shoot I mean if I mean thats one heck of a we too we got to give the man credit that is a thick head of hair that is a senior microbiology man every every teams got one of those right what sport this one Jaden young hits the three hes in double figures with 10 I think its special its special to celebrate this clemon team I think theres a lot of Hope for what this team can do Post go ahead Kell three there it is Applause stolen away by latiff NS to the free throw line and just watching not what theyre doing on the court but watching the Clemson sideline now it tells you what their success means to those scholarship guys look it means the world to them because theyre their brothers right and theyre guys that they dont have the same reward that the starters have which is playing time oh please he got so excited to get that opportunity he for a split second there he thought he might get a dunk its probably why he lost the ball come on go ahead thats awesome I love it Victor lockin was doing a happy dance along the Clemson sideline final seconds time expires Clemson puts an exclamation point on their greatest regular season in program history theyve won 26 games in a season something theyve only done once before back in 1990 and the tigers are hungry for more come March pretty crazy to say three of 20 from three yet an impressive performance this is really a fun team to watch an easy team to support and I think a lot of people are going to get behind Clemson come March and theres also a sense of end of one chapter yes but were now into the meat of the story new season AC tournament selection Sunday a week from tomorrow Applause Music Applause Music Applause he Applause
